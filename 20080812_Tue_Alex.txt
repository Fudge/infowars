[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:45.800]  Texas, Alex Jones hello my friends thank you for joining us today we will
[00:45.800 --> 00:52.560]  have continual coverage of the ongoing conflict in Georgia with Russia and US
[00:52.560 --> 00:58.280]  backed forces we have dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us coming up in 30
[00:58.280 --> 01:02.760]  minutes for a short interview part two of his analysis on what was happening
[01:02.760 --> 01:07.120]  last Friday former Wall Street Journal editor who's one of our routine
[01:07.120 --> 01:10.760]  contributors were honored to have him of course also former head of the Treasury
[01:10.760 --> 01:16.960]  Department policy he will be joining us and then I we had a heated debate for
[01:16.960 --> 01:21.400]  about an hour few weeks ago so I thought we'd have Webster Tarpley back on for a
[01:21.400 --> 01:25.400]  full two hours today to analyze what's happening and Russia to break that down
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.160]  from with his perspective to get into the two political parties and who's
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.080]  controlling them and looking forward into this election Bill Clinton of
[01:33.080 --> 01:37.240]  course scheduled they announced two days ago to be introducing the vice
[01:37.240 --> 01:44.960]  presidential candidate that means it's guaranteed or 99.9% Hillary Rodham
[01:44.960 --> 01:50.720]  Clinton so I guess Tarpley will still be telling us that Hillary is going to save
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.760]  us when she's lined up with Obama oh god help us so I like Tarpley and I and I
[01:57.760 --> 02:03.160]  think he's right on most things and he's a smart guy but they're all bought and
[02:03.160 --> 02:07.560]  paid for ladies and gentlemen I mean even trying to pick sides in the US Russian
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.160]  conflict with the client state Georgia we can't forget that Putin was caught
[02:13.160 --> 02:18.800]  blowing up his own apartment buildings by Moscow police and then by police in
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.160]  other city south of there to blame it on the Chechens as a pretext to invade
[02:23.160 --> 02:29.720]  Chechnya now granted the US had al-Qaeda in there attacking Russians and the
[02:29.720 --> 02:33.480]  Russians needed a reason to send in the full military to get popular support
[02:33.480 --> 02:39.920]  for after they've been demoralized with what happened in Afghanistan now that
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.000]  was very sick wasn't it there I am playing through the mindset of the
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.520]  Russian war planners that's how easy you fall into this military thought pattern
[02:49.520 --> 02:57.120]  of well we're demoralized we can't fight back against al-Qaeda US backed same
[02:57.120 --> 03:01.080]  al-Qaeda that attacks Russia to bring the Russians into Afghanistan in 1980
[03:01.080 --> 03:08.520]  attack six months before in mid 1979 and so there's the attitude of Putin I've
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.640]  got to become a strong president I've got to have a strong Russia the West is
[03:11.640 --> 03:16.840]  gobbling up all of our satellites I'm not going to get elected look at this
[03:16.840 --> 03:22.600]  alcoholic I work for Boris Yeltsin well I'll just an alcoholic who couldn't get
[03:22.600 --> 03:28.000]  out of a chair or talk that drugged out probably about Putin so they blew up
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.240]  four apartment buildings they got caught planting bombs in another two caught
[03:35.240 --> 03:40.920]  right-handed FSB Federal Security Bureau that's where Putin comes from it's the
[03:40.920 --> 03:46.600]  former KGB he was the head of that in Leningrad St. Petersburg whatever the
[03:46.600 --> 03:56.560]  name of it is this week so we will be going over that for you today man I got
[03:56.560 --> 03:59.760]  a marathon I'm on with Texmars for an hour today after I got off the air taping

[08:07.280 --> 08:27.280]  your mind international Russian television Russian today reported that Russia was prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons if the United States or NATO
[08:27.280 --> 08:33.320]  attacked any of their forces repulsing the Georgian slash US slash Israeli sneak
[08:33.320 --> 08:39.960]  attack I've done an analysis of the Georgian leadership and basically the
[08:39.960 --> 08:47.560]  entire leadership is made up of Israeli or slash NATO slash British government
[08:47.560 --> 08:51.680]  operatives the minister of defense and the foreign minister are both Israeli
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.800]  Mossad former defense officers themselves I mean you can't make stuff up like this a
[08:56.800 --> 09:03.880]  bunch of the other top echelon are openly you know former officers in the
[09:03.880 --> 09:09.200]  NATO structure many of them aren't even from Georgia basically it's just
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.080]  come they don't even bother to have anybody from Georgia but Mikhail
[09:14.080 --> 09:21.400]  Shasvili so we're gonna be breaking that down today also democracy now had a
[09:21.400 --> 09:26.880]  air force weapons expert on going into the fact that Russia clearly rolled nukes
[09:26.880 --> 09:34.680]  tactical nukes into Georgian space menacing any US retaliatory action
[09:34.680 --> 09:40.760]  McCain the neocons are all threatening how they want war military action against
[09:40.760 --> 09:47.640]  Russia there's nothing more pathetic than William Crystal that little demonic
[09:47.640 --> 09:51.760]  dwarf shooting his mouth off about nuclear war every five minutes it's
[09:51.760 --> 09:56.360]  just incredible here's some bad news for everybody that I want to go ahead and
[09:56.360 --> 10:01.320]  cover first though Ron Paul's wife in serious condition and hospital
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.320]  associated press this has been out for 15 hours and I just now learned of it
[10:06.320 --> 10:08.800]  and scanned through the Patriot sites this morning and didn't see anybody
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.520]  covering it we're getting it up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com right
[10:12.520 --> 10:17.560]  now Ron Paul's wife is in serious condition in hospital the wife of
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.840]  Republican representative Ron Paul was in serious but stable condition Monday
[10:22.840 --> 10:27.920]  night at a hospital a spokesman for the Congressman said Carol Paul was in
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.120]  critical care but at an unidentified hospital spokesman Jesse Benton said
[10:32.120 --> 10:35.600]  in a statement. Benton would not disclose why Carol Paul was admitted to the
[10:35.600 --> 10:41.760]  hospital Monday only saying she has had several abdominal surgeries sick could
[10:41.760 --> 10:49.960]  be anything endometriosis it could be you know anything in her intestines in
[10:49.960 --> 10:53.640]  her uterus you have no idea what it could be Paul appreciates the outpouring
[10:53.640 --> 10:57.440]  of concern and good wishes during this difficult time Benton said the Texas
[10:57.440 --> 11:00.680]  Congressman from Lake Jackson Ron Paul was libertarian party nominee for
[11:00.680 --> 11:04.360]  president in 88 and ran unsuccessfully for the 2008 GOP presidential
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.400]  nomination this campaign which was a sensation on the internet with support
[11:08.400 --> 11:14.040]  from Republicans independence and at Democrats so she is in the hospital in
[11:14.040 --> 11:25.280]  Houston and it could be anything so we will continue to give you any
[11:25.280 --> 11:34.440]  developments on that as they unfold Carol Paul in critical in serious but
[11:34.440 --> 11:43.920]  stable condition in serious but stable condition okay before I get into Russia
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.080]  and is there a ceasefire are the Russians ceasing military operations
[11:49.080 --> 11:56.040]  their president had said they had about eight hours ago but there's still
[11:56.040 --> 12:00.760]  reports of the Georgians firing at the Russians that's what they do they
[12:00.760 --> 12:04.200]  continue to fire and then say they've done this for the last four days and then
[12:04.200 --> 12:09.840]  say oh my god Russia's attacking us for no reason seeing in BBC we have
[12:09.840 --> 12:15.000]  mainstream reports on this have all been caught showing images since Friday
[12:15.000 --> 12:26.120]  morning of self-propelled rocket arrays tanks attacking Ossetia from the
[12:26.120 --> 12:30.080]  Georgian side attacking the Russian enclave and then they put it on the
[12:30.080 --> 12:37.480]  news and I noticed this Friday and frankly I bought it I mean I get caught
[12:37.480 --> 12:45.520]  I make mistakes I mean to realize the media is that deceptive lies that much
[12:46.520 --> 12:52.960]  is really hard to come to grips with and hard to deal with I mean I knew that it
[12:52.960 --> 13:01.960]  was an enclave Russian enclave I knew that Georgia had been building up with
[13:01.960 --> 13:08.280]  US Israeli and NATO support I was aware of all of that but as we started
[13:08.280 --> 13:16.560]  reporting at about 1124 here on the show Friday when it finally hit our news was
[13:16.560 --> 13:24.480]  overshadowed by the Olympics when it finally hit I went on to see it in the
[13:24.480 --> 13:29.760]  rest of it the headlines were Georgian president says Russia attacking and then
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.440]  I turned on the video reports on the television and on the internet streaming
[13:33.440 --> 13:40.360]  from CNN Fox and it showed Osseti vehicles I've now had time to go look at
[13:40.360 --> 13:43.280]  the insignias blow them up it's confirmed I didn't just believe the Russian
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.080]  media I went and blew it up and looked at it last night this morning and it is
[13:47.080 --> 13:53.440]  confirmed that they were showing Georgian military attacking civilians with
[13:53.440 --> 13:58.280]  rockets and artillery and saying the Russians were doing it I mean I know the
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.560]  media lies I know they feed us a steady diet of pure bull but can you almost
[14:02.560 --> 14:06.640]  even blame the public when there's just pure lies and distortions coming out of
[14:06.640 --> 14:10.800]  the control corporate press on key issues on key events it's almost total
[14:10.800 --> 14:16.360]  lies on other events it might be half truth or 90% truth or just spin or
[14:16.360 --> 14:18.840]  there's a lot of news that isn't completely controlled it's mainstream
[14:18.840 --> 14:22.480]  that comes out that tells the truth like cops taser young man 19 times and you
[14:22.480 --> 14:29.440]  can judge what you think of that so we look at multiple sources and that's
[14:29.440 --> 14:33.400]  how we use mainstream and alternative media do we everything right no we get
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.480]  a little more often right than wrong in fact in about 95% of the time we get
[14:37.480 --> 14:41.400]  it right and then in hindsight we always get it right as we analyze things but
[14:41.400 --> 14:47.960]  that was the level of deception I was on the air Friday saying well it's showing
[14:47.960 --> 14:55.120]  Russian tanks and Russian artillery pieces and missile systems firing because
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.840]  that's what CNN was saying and I I noticed it was always far away shots they
[14:59.840 --> 15:07.840]  knew they lied that's what they do now within minutes we got it straight and
[15:07.840 --> 15:16.600]  said no wait a minute this says in the bottom of all these stories that Georgia
[15:16.600 --> 15:21.680]  attacked Ossetia in a sneak attack Thursday night into Friday morning and
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.520]  then we pointed out there been a 30 plus 30 times buildup in their military then
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.200]  we pointed out that they had cut the water off to Ossetia a month before and
[15:31.200 --> 15:36.080]  already been taking pot shots at their police now the media is trying to spin
[15:36.080 --> 15:40.360]  it the mainstream media has been caught lying about Russia attacking Georgia
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.520]  premeditatedly total line and so now they're spending it saying well Russia
[15:44.520 --> 15:48.600]  did provocative things with their peacekeepers in the weeks before those
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.680]  peacekeepers had UN troops commanding them watching everything they did and
[15:53.680 --> 15:59.320]  ordering them and it's now come out to not fire back at Georgians when they'd
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.960]  been taking pot shots at them and shooting them so that's a lie we went to
[16:03.960 --> 16:08.840]  the research there you know when something breaks live at the moment you
[16:08.840 --> 16:12.920]  know it may take us 30 minutes to figure out CNN and Fox and everybody in BBC
[16:12.920 --> 16:18.760]  are lying and then wait a minute it's really Georgia that's attacking Russia
[16:18.760 --> 16:26.880]  a Russian province basically enclave and then it took us days to figure out
[16:26.880 --> 16:33.000]  that it was basically Israeli run predominantly with NATO backing in the
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.680]  world's a big complex place it's just incredibly deceptive just it layer
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.720]  after layer after layer of lies now let's shift gears this is huge news I
[16:44.720 --> 16:49.640]  want to play this audio of two weeks ago John McCain saying we need an Iraq style
[16:49.640 --> 16:54.600]  surge in the United States and then that dovetails with the governor of
[16:54.600 --> 16:58.040]  Illinois saying he wants martial law and the National Guard to do gun
[16:58.040 --> 17:01.680]  confiscation and they now are doing that in areas of Illinois then it dovetails
[17:01.680 --> 17:07.320]  with CNN reporting in a positive way like it's no big deal martial law you
[17:07.320 --> 17:11.640]  can't leave your house even during the day and we're going to play that clip
[17:11.640 --> 17:16.400]  for you yes we're not joking it's happening here we go we know that there
[17:16.400 --> 17:22.240]  are some cities in America where the murder rate is gone way way up and
[17:22.240 --> 17:29.120]  obviously we need to do the obvious we might look at what Rudy Giuliani did in
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.480]  New York City when he became mayor of that city he turned it into a city that
[17:34.480 --> 17:38.920]  really none of us were comfortable in walking through the streets to one that's
[17:38.920 --> 17:43.840]  basically safe and some of those tactics very frankly you mentioned war in
[17:43.840 --> 17:49.240]  Iraq are somewhat like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you
[17:49.240 --> 17:52.520]  clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live
[17:52.520 --> 17:58.400]  there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you
[17:58.400 --> 18:01.800]  provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law
[18:01.800 --> 18:06.680]  enforcement it's okay so and that's what Clinton proposed when he said we're
[18:06.680 --> 18:10.520]  gonna have gunsweeps in the inner cities they set the precedent there check
[18:10.520 --> 18:14.720]  points from San Diego to Dallas Texas they just randomly shut down even nice
[18:14.720 --> 18:18.280]  neighborhoods it's wrong to do it to poor folks but nice area you just pull up
[18:18.280 --> 18:23.720]  like what's going on officers oh just a security check please ID registration and
[18:23.720 --> 18:29.560]  they just phase it in they just implement it and that's now what is

[25:25.120 --> 25:30.880]  and sheriffs okay I'll never forget going to the SWAT team commander in
[25:30.880 --> 25:34.880]  Travis County because his guys had been basically threatening me to watch
[25:34.880 --> 25:38.640]  myself at county commissioners because the county commissioners were scared of
[25:38.640 --> 25:41.320]  me and people that were coming down there every week when they were seizing
[25:41.320 --> 25:45.400]  people's children for no reason and I mean no reason three tardies to class
[25:45.400 --> 25:48.480]  they were grabbing them and I went down there I told them stop your criminal
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.320]  activity and the SWAT team guy came in there and sat down beside me sort of
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.520]  bumping his shoulder into me we got his video that on the web and I and I said
[25:56.520 --> 26:01.040]  you better watch it buddy and then the they had cameras because the SWAT team
[26:01.040 --> 26:04.240]  was in the building across the street and they had you know dialed into the
[26:04.240 --> 26:08.000]  security cameras and Lieutenant Beck who was a nice Marine Corps veteran
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.840]  Vietnam nice fella said why don't you come over and talk to me we wasn't
[26:11.840 --> 26:17.040]  playing good cop he was for real and he said Alex this is all crazy there's not
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.920]  Delta Force there's not martial law we all listen to your radio show we got
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.640]  your videos we've seen the Oklahoma City video that's a little suspicious yeah
[26:25.640 --> 26:29.360]  but we're patriots no that's gonna happen just please stop screaming at the
[26:29.360 --> 26:33.120]  commissioners it's scary and I said you mark my words you will be approached by
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.640]  Delta Force and the CIA within the year they've already gone to at least 77
[26:37.640 --> 26:40.960]  counties and they're and I'm sort of giving him the documents the secret
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.080]  documents that we've gotten it's all on video the idiot FBI gave a secret
[26:46.080 --> 26:49.360]  documents at a roadside checkpoint with the army instead of the ones that were
[26:49.360 --> 26:53.560]  for the media morons but the point that's all in my film police state to the
[26:53.560 --> 26:57.160]  takeover but that's the kind of stuff that slips into our hands and he laughed
[26:57.160 --> 27:00.120]  at me he called me six months later going can you come by here and he goes
[27:00.120 --> 27:03.400]  look Delta Force is card they came by and said everything you said I'm not
[27:03.400 --> 27:05.960]  gonna tell you what else they said but it's the same stuff that happened with
[27:05.960 --> 27:10.000]  the police chief at San Antonio how do you know about this who do you work for
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.880]  and I said I work for America I work for the Bill of Rights this stuff all

[27:22.040 --> 27:27.080]  people about black helicopters and so I told you it's gonna be checkpoints it's
[27:27.080 --> 27:30.480]  gonna be police asking you questions I had I was at the shopping mall yesterday

[27:50.320 --> 27:53.400]  it was kind of a joke and the guy looked at me serious and I just said just
[27:53.400 --> 27:57.360]  getting sunglasses you know answered his questions so I could leave in America I
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.000]  thought the guy was joking but he was looking at me real serious I mean this

[35:00.840 --> 35:04.080]  is during the day this is during the night everyone has stopped at check
[35:04.080 --> 35:08.400]  points they've had two shootings and a few rapes and quote people loitering
[35:08.400 --> 35:11.920]  instead of just having real investigations and going after the criminals as
[35:11.920 --> 35:15.680]  society unravels and of course the economy is dead there so there's robbery
[35:15.680 --> 35:20.640]  people wanting money for food well here it is because I'm gonna get Dr. Roberts
[35:20.640 --> 35:23.760]  take on this he's written a lot about the police state here it is because of
[35:23.760 --> 35:27.080]  all the recent crime in Helena West Helena we're talking about robberies
[35:27.080 --> 35:31.920]  home invasions loitering shootings the mayor of Helena West Helena has decided
[35:31.920 --> 35:36.480]  to impose a curfew but only in certain areas and that applies for everyone no
[35:36.480 --> 35:40.280]  matter the age and no matter the times if you're caught violating curfew
[35:40.280 --> 35:44.000]  there's a chance you could wind up behind bars we're afraid that somebody's
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.400]  going to get seriously hurt by what's what's going on this curfew for all
[35:48.400 --> 35:54.160]  people everybody's subject to stop an investigation it's almost akin to
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.760]  martial law and that's exactly what some are calling it for now second street and
[35:58.760 --> 36:02.560]  several streets surrounding it will look just like this and if you're caught
[36:02.560 --> 36:06.400]  outside without a good enough excuse it's zero tolerance they're going to jail
[36:06.400 --> 36:10.840]  an idea that's fine by Martha Coleman you never know where a bullet is gonna go
[36:10.840 --> 36:15.960]  you never know who house is gonna hit what person is gonna hit and you know
[36:15.960 --> 36:19.880]  sleeping on the floor because you don't know where a bullet is gonna you know
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.040]  go to it might come in my house it might come in my neighbor's house so I
[36:24.040 --> 36:28.480]  commend the Helena West Helena Police Department but others say instead of
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.120]  addressing the problem it's just gonna make it worse and some say instead of
[36:32.120 --> 36:35.760]  home sweet home the past 24 hours it's been like jail
[36:35.760 --> 36:39.320]  jail you can't come out your own home you can't go to the store without getting
[36:39.320 --> 36:43.200]  stopped by the police and questioning arrest while Richard Robinson applauds the
[36:43.200 --> 36:46.560]  city's efforts I think the idea is good to stop the crime but I think the way
[36:46.560 --> 36:49.120]  that the police department is handling the situation is all wrong when the
[36:49.120 --> 36:52.320]  police come by and tell you you own your own property or not that you cannot come
[36:52.320 --> 36:55.720]  outside I think that's martial law that can only be inflicted by the National
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.000]  Guard that's my opinion on it but after several rapes robberies and shootings
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.360]  Mayor James Valley says he's exhausted all the possibilities and he says this
[37:04.360 --> 37:08.600]  is the best move to turn around with some are calling a very rough area this
[37:08.600 --> 37:12.480]  term belongs to the taxpayer citizens not to the drug dealers and the
[37:12.480 --> 37:16.840]  hustlers and we're gonna pop them in the head yeah we have triple the heroin
[37:16.840 --> 37:21.160]  double the cocaine in our streets since the drug war began most people in
[37:21.160 --> 37:26.200]  prison and any nation in the world Mexican paramilitary troops kill cops on
[37:26.200 --> 37:30.520]  a weekly basis here in Texas it's hardly in the news real crises go on
[37:30.520 --> 37:35.840]  everywhere but in this town they have checkpoints you're not allowed to leave
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.440]  your house during the day even be in your front yard this is martial law this
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.000]  no nation is this tyrannical no nation I mean even in Malaysia when they have
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  martial law in the past it's only at night and during certain emergency times
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.440]  and that's decried by the world but here the FBI saying they want random
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.120]  checkpoints on the streets of America the National Guard according to NBC news
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.200]  is being used for gun confiscations in Illinois not just Chicago we played that
[38:01.200 --> 38:07.600]  for you two weeks ago Dr. Roberts what do you think of that well I don't know the
[38:07.600 --> 38:14.120]  whole situation there but what this indicates to me is we see how the
[38:14.120 --> 38:21.400]  government Washington could use the sort of economic dislocations that we
[38:21.400 --> 38:28.280]  might be headed toward and the resulting crime that comes out of that to
[38:28.280 --> 38:35.960]  impose the same thing on the entire country so I think on the whole that you
[38:35.960 --> 38:43.360]  can't give these kinds of orders to people in a free society and it has to
[38:43.360 --> 38:48.960]  be their judge whether they're willing to take the risk to go out in the event
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.760]  that there's crime in the streets or whether they need to go out for the
[38:53.760 --> 38:59.680]  reason any any a number of legitimate reasons I don't think that you can tell
[38:59.680 --> 39:03.880]  people that in order to make you safe we're going to imprison you in your
[39:03.880 --> 39:10.920]  home the notion that we're made safe by the government taking away our
[39:10.920 --> 39:16.920]  civil liberties which is the Bush regime's line or this mayor's line that
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.840]  will make you safe by you know keeping everybody in their home so the bad guys
[39:21.840 --> 39:28.560]  can't leave to come bother you I don't think that this is consistent with them
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.000]  or the free society well they say that it's completely selectively enforced
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.320]  they decide they say it's day and night the police arbitrarily are now God and
[39:37.320 --> 39:41.240]  decide if you can leave or come or go to work or do it you know instead of the
[39:41.240 --> 39:46.120]  original police work and going after criminals this is just turning everyone
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.480]  into prisoners and this is the most extreme form of martial law saying don't
[39:50.480 --> 39:51.880]  leave your house
[39:51.880 --> 39:53.320]  uh... the
[39:53.320 --> 39:55.240]  this is incredible
[39:55.240 --> 40:00.720]  well uh... by i agree it's incredible it's probably being applied in the
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.560]  areas most subject to crime and violence
[40:04.560 --> 40:08.720]  and that's probably why it's selective into the mayor who
[40:08.720 --> 40:12.120]  uh... sees a problem and doesn't know what to do with it it might
[40:12.120 --> 40:14.840]  seem like you know a logical
[40:14.840 --> 40:18.320]  uh... thing to do but uh... if he if he were to
[40:18.320 --> 40:23.680]  uh... begotten step and think a step or two further he would see that this is
[40:23.680 --> 40:24.880]  not
[40:24.880 --> 40:28.200]  uh... a good thing it's not consistent
[40:28.200 --> 40:29.320]  with the free
[40:29.320 --> 40:33.320]  it's just out there and i'm not even sure he has this type of authority i don't
[40:33.320 --> 40:35.400]  really know if he does a lot
[40:35.400 --> 40:37.560]  but i certainly don't uh...
[40:37.560 --> 40:39.520]  think it's a good
[40:39.520 --> 40:41.640]  a good development
[40:41.640 --> 40:45.160]  well imagine driving through this town of what it must be like but but but it's
[40:45.160 --> 40:47.480]  it this is happening everywhere you know i reported
[40:47.480 --> 40:50.040]  a year and a half before it was in mainstream news
[40:50.040 --> 40:52.240]  that uh... that that time
[40:52.240 --> 40:54.720]  thirteen thousand preachers it's now twenty six thousand
[40:54.720 --> 40:56.800]  they covertly been hired by fema
[40:56.800 --> 41:00.040]  to prepare and and and gives give sermons not telling their flock that
[41:00.040 --> 41:01.240]  were government written
[41:01.240 --> 41:04.480]  about handing guns and going to fema camp submitting the government romance
[41:04.480 --> 41:07.800]  thirteen now it's been in the mainstream news for last year
[41:07.800 --> 41:11.200]  before broke this two years ago two and a half years ago
[41:11.200 --> 41:15.000]  uh... but this is a large program going on all over the place you look at pdd
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.320]  fifty one
[41:16.320 --> 41:18.600]  the john warren defense authorization act
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.240]  uh... you look at all of this uh... it states martial law it states the
[41:22.240 --> 41:24.280]  president is basically a dictator
[41:24.280 --> 41:27.560]  and now we have these gun-knockin talk programs going on everywhere
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.440]  uh... there's no doubt this is a larger concerted atmosphere in a spirit
[41:31.440 --> 41:33.800]  of uh... tyranny doctor roberts
[41:33.800 --> 41:37.440]  uh... well i think uh... i've written a lot about that agree with you i'm not
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.560]  sure this particular mayor is part of that
[41:41.560 --> 41:46.240]  and he may he may be a part of it but most of us just having picked up on these
[41:46.240 --> 41:48.440]  kinds of things that's what i think
[41:48.440 --> 41:49.200]  yeah
[41:49.200 --> 41:53.440]  and but uh... i don't think this is a federal program this is uh... some local
[41:53.440 --> 41:55.000]  thing where
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.640]  apparently times are hard and uh...
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.480]  and uh...
[42:00.480 --> 42:01.320]  and they don't
[42:01.320 --> 42:03.000]  and they don't know how to cope
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.200]  uh... cope with it
[42:05.200 --> 42:06.800]  are making a mistake
[42:06.800 --> 42:07.800]  but uh...
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.880]  uh... you're right the real danger is it's federal because uh...
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.440]  uh... mayor that's local but the local i think
[42:17.440 --> 42:18.880]  uh... when they do it
[42:18.880 --> 42:20.080]  nationally
[42:20.080 --> 42:21.400]  a different
[42:21.400 --> 42:22.280]  that look at you
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.400]  all right let's shift gears into russia you were last on this friday wrote a big
[42:26.400 --> 42:27.460]  editorial
[42:27.460 --> 42:30.360]  uh... sunday you're kind of sure this we read part of one there before it was
[42:30.360 --> 42:32.040]  even released monday
[42:32.040 --> 42:33.880]  uh... more has developed
[42:33.880 --> 42:36.600]  and we've now found out that the minister
[42:36.600 --> 42:39.600]  they had defense minister and the foreign minister are both former israeli
[42:39.600 --> 42:40.800]  military officers
[42:40.800 --> 42:42.280]  and admittedly massage
[42:42.280 --> 42:46.880]  the rest of the government is nato and ukrainian and u.s.. it appears the only
[42:46.880 --> 42:49.080]  major person in their government who is
[42:49.080 --> 42:50.080]  georgian
[42:50.080 --> 42:52.560]  uh... is uh... michael
[42:52.560 --> 42:54.840]  chest vile airship just feeling
[42:54.840 --> 42:58.840]  uh... and uh... it it they've now or russian tv is reporting they have
[42:58.840 --> 43:00.400]  captured u.s
[43:00.400 --> 43:01.440]  trainers
[43:01.440 --> 43:02.720]  mercenaries
[43:02.720 --> 43:05.880]  uh... and they've also reported that uh... russians that did
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.360]  menace the u.s.. with tactical nuclear weapons if you're not aware that i can
[43:09.360 --> 43:10.280]  play the report
[43:10.280 --> 43:13.480]  uh... but give us your basic breakdown of what's happening in with russia and
[43:13.480 --> 43:15.360]  georgia
[43:15.360 --> 43:20.280]  well uh... what happened in georgia is the uh... the national endowment for
[43:20.280 --> 43:22.240]  democracy
[43:22.240 --> 43:23.960]  anneal con
[43:23.960 --> 43:26.520]  taxpayer american taxpayer funded
[43:26.520 --> 43:28.440]  and organization went in there with
[43:28.440 --> 43:31.320]  american taxpayers money went into georgia
[43:31.320 --> 43:36.280]  uh... big elections bought elections created american puppet state
[43:36.280 --> 43:37.360]  and uh...
[43:37.360 --> 43:42.760]  this is part of the neocon strategy of uh... of encircling russia
[43:42.760 --> 43:44.640]  and uh... putting
[43:44.640 --> 43:49.560]  buffers between uh... russia and the middle east though that they're
[43:49.560 --> 43:51.040]  influence uh...
[43:51.040 --> 43:53.080]  and there is
[43:53.080 --> 43:54.720]  precluded
[43:54.720 --> 43:56.200]  and uh...
[43:56.200 --> 43:59.200]  i'm almost certain that this uh...
[43:59.200 --> 44:01.440]  attack on the south
[44:01.440 --> 44:02.560]  of sasio
[44:02.560 --> 44:06.200]  by the georgians who was engineered by cheney
[44:06.200 --> 44:07.000]  uh...
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.800]  uh... it seems to me the purpose of this is to uh...
[44:12.800 --> 44:14.360]  hasten
[44:14.360 --> 44:17.440]  georgia's admission into nato
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.080]  uh... apparently one of the men and the european members sort of
[44:22.080 --> 44:23.360]  delayed it
[44:23.360 --> 44:24.840]  so i think this is the
[44:24.840 --> 44:28.920]  say look look the russian aggressors poor georgia
[44:28.920 --> 44:32.760]  if only they had been members of nato russia never would have done this i mean
[44:32.760 --> 44:34.320]  i think that's
[44:34.320 --> 44:36.320]  what it is and that they want to
[44:36.320 --> 44:39.320]  completely capture the puppet state
[44:39.320 --> 44:40.880]  by sticking it in
[44:40.880 --> 44:43.520]  tonight though and i think that's what's
[44:43.520 --> 44:46.640]  uh... behind all this
[44:46.640 --> 44:52.000]  the hypocrisy of course of the uh... of the bush regime is extraordinary they
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.600]  uh... again lying through their teeth me how do we know they're lying ellipse
[44:55.600 --> 44:56.880]  living right
[44:56.880 --> 44:59.360]  lying through the teeth that
[44:59.360 --> 45:01.840]  uh... russia invaded
[45:01.840 --> 45:03.440]  and this is not
[45:03.440 --> 45:06.480]  the fact that the georgians
[45:06.480 --> 45:07.520]  after
[45:07.520 --> 45:11.320]  but giving assurance that they would never do this just
[45:11.320 --> 45:13.040]  very recently
[45:13.040 --> 45:13.880]  uh...
[45:13.880 --> 45:16.200]  pull off the sneak attack
[45:16.200 --> 45:19.280]  i clearly are the american uh...
[45:19.280 --> 45:25.120]  uh... forces there training the georgians probably directing it
[45:25.120 --> 45:26.200]  and uh...
[45:26.200 --> 45:29.840]  now we're trying to get the whole world
[45:29.840 --> 45:31.400]  uh... with our
[45:31.400 --> 45:35.360]  propaganda and disinformation uh... ralda
[45:35.360 --> 45:39.600]  uh... about the russians this is another false flag
[45:39.600 --> 45:42.800]  operation run by
[45:42.800 --> 45:44.920]  new conservatives
[45:44.920 --> 45:49.040]  the russians it's very interesting in today's problem
[45:49.040 --> 45:50.520]  online
[45:50.520 --> 45:52.280]  uh... there's an article
[45:52.280 --> 45:55.920]  title is bush why don't you shut up
[45:55.920 --> 45:57.560]  and then it says
[45:57.560 --> 46:01.040]  uh... marie that the opening closing paragraph
[46:01.040 --> 46:04.480]  taking the words of the lost king of spain
[46:04.480 --> 46:05.320]  and his
[46:05.320 --> 46:06.600]  bellic
[46:06.600 --> 46:07.480]  president
[46:07.480 --> 46:10.120]  you go chagas
[46:10.120 --> 46:11.280]  we use them not
[46:11.280 --> 46:16.840]  as a response to a diet ride but rather a just report to an embossed president
[46:16.840 --> 46:17.600]  george
[46:17.600 --> 46:19.560]  double your book
[46:19.560 --> 46:21.720]  why don't you shut up
[46:21.720 --> 46:24.400]  and this is not hard to put it
[46:24.400 --> 46:27.120]  president bush why don't you shut up
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.680]  do you really think anyone gives any importance
[46:30.680 --> 46:35.440]  whatsoever to your words after eight years of your criminal and murderous
[46:35.440 --> 46:37.880]  regime and policies
[46:37.880 --> 46:42.520]  do you really believe you have any moral ground whatsoever
[46:42.520 --> 46:44.360]  and you really imagine
[46:44.360 --> 46:49.840]  there is a single human being anywhere on this planet who does who does not
[46:49.840 --> 46:52.160]  pick up his middle finger
[46:52.160 --> 46:53.480]  every time
[46:53.480 --> 46:58.920]  you appear on a tv screen
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.440]  do you really believe you have the right to give any
[47:02.440 --> 47:06.000]  and your advice after abu
[47:06.000 --> 47:11.560]  after guantanamo after the massacres of hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens
[47:11.560 --> 47:16.200]  after the torture by cia operatives
[47:16.200 --> 47:18.120]  kind of difficult
[47:18.120 --> 47:19.360]  so that's what
[47:19.360 --> 47:23.160]  the russian press thanks a bit all robert that was my next question i have
[47:23.160 --> 47:25.200]  bush's quotes here
[47:25.200 --> 47:28.280]  and uh... i could read them all i could paraphrase he gave a press conference
[47:28.280 --> 47:31.520]  morning everybody's probably already seen her hurt it we can play the clip
[47:31.520 --> 47:32.520]  but he said
[47:32.520 --> 47:36.720]  russia has engaged in aggression they've invaded a sovereign nation
[47:36.720 --> 47:40.120]  this is what this is this is criminal they did this is horrible
[47:40.120 --> 47:42.540]  what do you do in afghanistan iraq
[47:42.540 --> 47:47.360]  i mean that and they thought it was preparing to do and uh... i ran
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.640]  eleven long
[47:51.640 --> 47:53.160]  yeah
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.320]  that's what i'm saying the hypocrisy of the administration is astonishing and
[47:57.320 --> 47:58.960]  that's what this
[47:58.960 --> 48:01.080]  uh... article in today's
[48:01.080 --> 48:03.000]  problem in moscow
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.920]  is pouring out in your show that
[48:04.920 --> 48:07.320]  you can see the total disdain
[48:07.320 --> 48:09.120]  uh... for president bush
[48:09.120 --> 48:10.880]  on the part of the
[48:10.880 --> 48:11.720]  of the
[48:11.720 --> 48:12.400]  soviet
[48:12.400 --> 48:14.240]  of the russian press
[48:14.240 --> 48:15.080]  now
[48:15.080 --> 48:16.360]  uh... what the whole
[48:16.360 --> 48:18.560]  what i think here
[48:18.560 --> 48:20.240]  is that
[48:20.240 --> 48:22.600]  and russians
[48:22.600 --> 48:24.920]  are far more reasonable people
[48:24.920 --> 48:27.360]  than the bush administration
[48:27.360 --> 48:29.440]  uh...
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.160]  uh... be suckered in by the
[48:33.160 --> 48:34.920]  european members of
[48:34.920 --> 48:37.800]  nato into ending this
[48:37.800 --> 48:39.400]  and pulling out
[48:39.400 --> 48:43.080]  in which case the russians will be further betrayed
[48:43.080 --> 48:45.520]  uh... the next step will be to put
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.600]  uh... georgia into nato and then station nato trips there
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.120]  and then they will have to make the clinton's
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.760]  uh... the russians out of the two
[48:56.760 --> 49:01.480]  uh... disputed promises just as they did uh... whenever they brought in the
[49:01.480 --> 49:04.600]  muslims to attack the serbs in kosovo that they thought it
[49:04.600 --> 49:07.240]  then i said don't worry we're not going to break it off and they did that last
[49:07.240 --> 49:07.960]  year
[49:07.960 --> 49:09.040]  right right
[49:09.040 --> 49:12.880]  now you see that uh... americans
[49:12.880 --> 49:16.200]  uh... basically unaware and go to people
[49:16.200 --> 49:20.120]  but in my understanding is that this disputed area
[49:20.120 --> 49:22.400]  or both disputed areas
[49:22.400 --> 49:24.940]  were originally part of russia and that
[49:24.940 --> 49:28.040]  joseph stollett when he was a dictator
[49:28.040 --> 49:29.640]  uh... of the Soviet Union
[49:29.640 --> 49:30.960]  wanted to put
[49:30.960 --> 49:33.760]  part of them into georgia and he just
[49:33.760 --> 49:36.220]  did it because he was from central
[49:36.220 --> 49:37.840]  uh... georgia he was from georgia
[49:37.840 --> 49:41.040]  yeah he was from georgia and speaking of the devil he was the editor of
[49:41.040 --> 49:45.720]  bravo exactly and at the time georgia was part of the Soviet Union and actually
[49:45.720 --> 49:50.320]  had been part of the russian empire for centuries yes abkhazia and osetia have
[49:50.320 --> 49:51.880]  always been part of russia
[49:51.880 --> 49:54.320]  yeah and so it was it was the
[49:54.320 --> 49:55.800]  georgian
[49:55.800 --> 49:56.720]  stollett
[49:56.720 --> 49:59.520]  who became dictator so it didn't
[49:59.520 --> 50:01.440]  in the twentieth century he
[50:01.440 --> 50:02.720]  uh... broke off
[50:02.720 --> 50:04.520]  uh... peace of the
[50:04.520 --> 50:06.240]  uh... republican
[50:06.240 --> 50:10.400]  republic uh... of the russian republic of sascha
[50:10.400 --> 50:11.160]  and uh...
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.800]  stuck it into georgia and i think he may have also taken that other disputed
[50:14.800 --> 50:16.480]  part of the west part
[50:16.480 --> 50:17.760]  uh... of georgia that
[50:17.760 --> 50:18.800]  has black c
[50:18.800 --> 50:21.160]  now he did your right i saw that in the history books
[50:21.160 --> 50:24.400]  so uh... if that's the case
[50:24.400 --> 50:27.720]  and these are historic fact that apparently the people in these places
[50:27.720 --> 50:29.660]  were largely russian
[50:29.660 --> 50:33.720]  and apparently you have russian passport so ninety plus percent well
[50:33.720 --> 50:35.000]  you're absolutely right
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.480]  and
[50:36.480 --> 50:40.560]  they were snuck attack by the georgians but u.s. backed
[50:40.560 --> 50:43.880]  when we come back on your take on the israeli connection here
[50:43.880 --> 50:45.400]  with their defense minister
[50:45.400 --> 50:47.840]  of georgia and their foreign minister being
[50:47.840 --> 50:50.280]  openly israeli's not even georgians
[50:50.280 --> 50:52.560]  uh... stay with us dr paul craig roberts
[50:52.560 --> 50:54.360]  also talk about the news
[50:54.360 --> 51:01.360]  the russia reportedly moved in when we get back stay with us
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.040]  what's up body
[51:03.040 --> 51:06.440]  well i got a question about those shielded secure sleeves from identity
[51:06.440 --> 51:07.440]  stronghold
[51:07.440 --> 51:10.280]  yeah the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new

[51:17.280 --> 51:18.440]  all body
[51:18.440 --> 51:21.880]  if everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve destroy our plan to steal
[51:21.880 --> 51:24.880]  credit card numbers at the mall with my new rfid reader
[51:24.880 --> 51:28.560]  i know but these are friends cry they promise not to tell anyone else
[51:28.560 --> 51:31.440]  i guess you're right that's what friends are for i suppose
[51:31.440 --> 51:34.160]  tell them they can get a five pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit
[51:34.160 --> 51:37.080]  cards and driver's licenses for nineteen ninety five

[51:59.280 --> 52:03.440]  thanks clad why should we fire congress because they use the constitution of the
[52:03.440 --> 52:07.000]  united states as a scrap of paper they swear no to follow it and then they
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.120]  rejected that
[52:08.120 --> 52:12.840]  was their employment document they haven't followed it congressman senators
[52:12.840 --> 52:15.120]  you're fired
[52:15.120 --> 52:17.320]  i think it's the next freedom to fascism
[52:17.320 --> 52:20.520]  washington you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our
[52:20.520 --> 52:24.240]  current political system and it gives a voice to americans across the country
[52:24.240 --> 52:27.480]  washington you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to
[52:27.480 --> 52:31.200]  the katrina disaster the president's illegal spy program in essay data
[52:31.200 --> 52:31.760]  mining
[52:31.760 --> 52:35.280]  files a secret court the illegal wiretapping of millions of americans
[52:35.280 --> 52:38.720]  and the last seven years of terror related spy bills how they affect you
[52:38.720 --> 52:42.320]  and what you can do about it washington you're fired captures the spirit and
[52:42.320 --> 52:44.640]  zest of an old-fashioned boston tea party

[54:38.400 --> 54:43.600]  uh... shifting gears on the russian subject into newt's
[54:43.600 --> 54:46.600]  there was a uh... major report
[54:46.600 --> 54:48.760]  although the whole bunch of different reports
[54:48.760 --> 54:51.600]  uh... that were
[54:51.600 --> 54:54.360]  in the russian press too many to mention we have some of those clips are gonna
[54:54.360 --> 54:55.840]  play later with tarpoli
[54:55.840 --> 54:59.080]  uh... the colonel sam gardener highly respected weapons expert
[54:59.080 --> 55:01.160]  and uh... air force tactics expert
[55:01.160 --> 55:04.480]  if the u.s. attack russia russia will use nuclear weapons this is him on
[55:04.480 --> 55:05.680]  democracy now
[55:05.680 --> 55:07.160]  last night i want to play a
[55:07.160 --> 55:08.640]  couple minutes of this where
[55:08.640 --> 55:09.920]  she's asking him
[55:09.920 --> 55:12.760]  could this lead to world war three and on the neocons have been saying that
[55:12.760 --> 55:14.680]  crystals been saying how great it is and
[55:14.680 --> 55:16.160]  let's have a confrontation with him
[55:16.160 --> 55:18.400]  here he is talking about how they clearly moved in
[55:18.400 --> 55:20.800]  to nuclear-tipped missiles here it is
[55:20.800 --> 55:22.120]  do we
[55:22.120 --> 55:28.240]  have anything to fear along those lines absolutely uh... let me say that
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.000]  if you were to rate the house serious
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.240]  strategic situations have been
[55:34.240 --> 55:35.880]  in the past few years
[55:35.880 --> 55:40.400]  this would be above iraq this would be above afghanistan
[55:40.400 --> 55:42.320]  and this would be above
[55:42.320 --> 55:44.880]  iran
[55:44.880 --> 55:51.600]  and who knows notice to americans the russians learned at the end of
[55:51.600 --> 55:53.520]  of the first gulf war
[55:53.520 --> 55:56.440]  that they couldn't they didn't think they could deal
[55:56.440 --> 56:01.520]  with the united states is uh... given the value in the quality of
[56:01.520 --> 56:04.800]  american precision convinced the weapons
[56:04.800 --> 56:07.840]  the russians put into their doctrine
[56:07.840 --> 56:08.800]  statement
[56:08.800 --> 56:11.400]  and broadcasted very loudly
[56:11.400 --> 56:16.520]  that if the united states were to use precision conventional weapons
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.560]  against russian troops
[56:18.560 --> 56:21.080]  the russians would be forced to respond
[56:21.080 --> 56:23.480]  with tactical nuclear weapons
[56:23.480 --> 56:27.440]  they continue to state this they practice this in their exercise
[56:27.440 --> 56:29.640]  they've even had exercises that
[56:29.640 --> 56:32.160]  very closely paralleled
[56:32.160 --> 56:34.000]  what went on in osatia
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.520]  where there is an independence movement
[56:36.520 --> 56:41.880]  they intervene conventionally to put down the independence movement
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.040]  uh... the united states and they don't respond with conventional airstrikes
[56:46.040 --> 56:50.120]  they then respond with tactical nuclear weapons they stop right there
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.040]  now again she asked the question we started a little bit late
[56:54.040 --> 56:56.720]  she has the question is there a threat of nuclear war we've seen that some
[56:56.720 --> 56:58.240]  russian press
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.120]  and then he says yes and then he talks about how they did move in
[57:02.120 --> 57:05.600]  uh... nuclear tip missiles clearly from intelligence
[57:05.600 --> 57:08.280]  uh... because they weren't for conventional use it was only two
[57:08.280 --> 57:13.160]  uh... that had the configuration and to be uh... tactical smaller nukes
[57:13.160 --> 57:16.880]  and uh... then he talks about the u s didn't expect this and basically backed
[57:16.880 --> 57:17.680]  off
[57:17.680 --> 57:20.760]  and that they didn't think russia would do this because they handed over
[57:20.760 --> 57:21.760]  uh... kosovo
[57:21.760 --> 57:23.520]  dr roberts
[57:23.520 --> 57:25.480]  uh... well uh...
[57:25.480 --> 57:26.800]  i don't know
[57:26.800 --> 57:29.440]  about the nuclear
[57:29.440 --> 57:31.360]  uh... weapons use of
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.240]  i don't think the russians
[57:33.240 --> 57:36.680]  uh... we need that in georgia because the united states is not
[57:36.680 --> 57:39.080]  capable of sending enough
[57:39.080 --> 57:40.520]  troops
[57:40.520 --> 57:44.400]  to georgia to confront uh... russian army
[57:44.400 --> 57:48.000]  and we just don't put all we don't have any troops they're all
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.120]  mired down in iraq and afghanistan
[57:51.120 --> 57:52.120]  and uh...
[57:52.120 --> 57:55.720]  uh... second uh... we would have a normal supply
[57:55.720 --> 57:57.840]  problems of the russians wouldn't
[57:57.840 --> 57:59.880]  have since it's their border
[57:59.880 --> 58:04.000]  i think it's all about air attacks out of nato basis
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.080]  uh... if if we uh... attack uh... russia i think the russia will go
[58:08.080 --> 58:10.920]  instantly on full nuclear alert
[58:10.920 --> 58:15.320]  it won't be uh... we won't be worried about pack your newt georgia would have
[58:15.320 --> 58:20.560]  to be worried about the new york and boston the white than the la chicago
[58:20.560 --> 58:21.320]  and here
[58:21.320 --> 58:24.680]  uh... the united states government isn't saying that they need to be dragged
[58:24.680 --> 58:26.600]  out quickly

[1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.360]  in closing dr roberts
[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:35.120]  two final questions a
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:37.960]  why are the neocons five and
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:39.240]  all of these guys
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:40.760]  crystal running around
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:44.200]  saying you know in circle of russia cheney called him and said there will be a
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:48.200]  response to this and basically threatened their president sunday that was in
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:49.560]  the associated press
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:52.120]  his quotes were incredibly incendiary
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:55.440]  uh... they've launched a sneak attack on them and now they're acting like russia
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:57.240]  caused all this
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:02.100]  uh... a it it does look like they're delusional and engage in megalomania
[1:01:02.100 --> 1:01:05.360]  with the all these little stunted no bodies you've never even been in the
[1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:06.320]  military
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:08.240]  wanting to flex their muscles a
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.520]  and then be uh... where do you see this going now how do you think this
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:12.440]  worked out
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:16.200]  for the u s nato versus russia
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:19.720]  well i think probably we've scared i need to allow us to death
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:21.160]  if we actually
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:23.120]  uh... measuring these kinds of
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:27.560]  threats to uh... a nuclear power who hasn't done anything except try to get
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.360]  along with us
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:33.120]  uh... so it may be uh... unless we have actually
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:37.760]  a purchased in blackmail all the leaders of uh... of the european
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:39.360]  countries it may be
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:40.560]  mean that they
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:44.560]  don't want to be a native to dangerous because it's run by insane people in
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:45.560]  washington
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:47.440]  that could be one fallout
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:49.680]  uh... the other fallout will
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:53.560]  it'll have to uh... certainly wake up the russians
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:58.000]  that trying to get along with us and cooperate with us uh... just means they
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.760]  get stabbed in the back repeatedly
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:03.200]  and uh... so i would imagine
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:04.880]  we'll see
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:06.320]  uh...
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:08.200]  a more aggressive uh...
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:11.880]  stance on the part of of the russians and since
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:17.080]  all of our european nato allies are dependent on russia for natural gas
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:22.280]  uh... they've got them probably as much leverage over allies as we do through
[1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:26.320]  blackmail and and uh... illegal payments to foreign
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:29.880]  to european leaders
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:32.120]  i think that uh...
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.400]  for for for cause they're insane
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:36.920]  the new conservatives and cheney
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.760]  and because bush is an embassal
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:42.000]  proud to say i don't know
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.800]  uh... we are in
[1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:47.560]  risk of enormous uh... horrendous events
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:50.760]  that could have simply and life on earth
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:52.000]  uh...
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.480]  but i think that you have a call it the rain of the cockroach
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:57.560]  that's right that's
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:00.320]  that's what i call it when i wrote about it sometime
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:02.200]  sometime back in
[1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.880]  i i think that the american people
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:08.840]  have been you know just completely irresponsible and uh...
[1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:11.880]  uh... they've let this criminal regime
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:12.920]  get in
[1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:15.000]  office and stay there for
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.160]  essentially eight years
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:21.840]  uh... run rush on over their right to their liberty to the constitution and
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:23.940]  other countries
[1:03:23.940 --> 1:03:28.440]  i mean that bush has destroyed iraq and uh... afghanistan
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:30.120]  the infrastructure is everything
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:33.160]  well i was in a huge number of people the man is
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:35.960]  uh... these are the greatest crime
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:38.200]  the world scene
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:40.920]  uh... it's an amazing criminal
[1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:42.120]  regime
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:46.040]  and every time they open their mouth in a while we now have all the evidence of
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:47.800]  the lives everywhere
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:49.040]  so i think they're
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:51.360]  uh... they are going to be
[1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:53.400]  determined
[1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:57.040]  that to propel us into some sort of major
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:03.360]  a conflict also came out said we have the power we're going to use it
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:04.200]  yeah but
[1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:07.680]  you know i'd like you and i think agree
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:12.320]  uh... the estimates of the power they have is greatly exaggerated united states
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.840]  just doesn't have the power that these people think it's got except for nukes
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:18.720]  which they're menacing everyone with
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:22.560]  yeah but the russians have nukes the chinese have no i know it's insane
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:26.080]  i think that he's having nukes
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:27.840]  uh...
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:31.640]  uh... what you have uh... told me on this program
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:35.720]  these behaviors is this really frightening if this is actually
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:41.760]  uh... what our so-called leaders are doing and saying is uh... they're clearly insane
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:42.960]  oh yeah they're clearly insane
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.080]  they've all been saying it

[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:09.960]  9-Eleven was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the
[1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:15.000]  New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a state? It was engineered by you,
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.560]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:24.440]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:29.960]  despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:36.520]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare you?
[1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:43.160]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:47.560]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the
[1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:51.400]  truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:57.480]  Truth rising. Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:00.040]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:11.240]  We interrupt this program with a special bulletin. America is now under martial law.
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:19.480]  All constitutional rights have been suspended. Stay in your homes.
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:26.840]  Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.
[1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:33.880]  Shut up. Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.
[1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:40.760]  Stay in your home. Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp after work.
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:47.080]  Anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew
[1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:56.440]  will be shot. Remain calm. Do not panic. Your neighborhood watch
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:01.160]  officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:09.960]  Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:18.280]  Stay in your home. Remain calm. The number one enemy of progress
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:25.800]  is questions. National security is more important than individual will.
[1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:35.960]  All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal. No more than two people may gather anywhere
[1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:42.280]  without permission. Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor.
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:52.680]  Shut up. Be happy. Obey all orders without questions. The comfort you demanded is now mandatory.
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:57.800]  Be happy. Now in England and many areas of the U.S.
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:02.280]  do not allow more than groups of two to three people to gather. Martial law is
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:05.000]  incrementally being put into place. Most of your local departments have been
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.080]  covertly federalized. Your police have been corrupted. Your police chiefs have been covertly
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:14.200]  paid off. A few have gone public and talked about the attempted bribery by CIA, Army, Delta Force.
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:19.800]  And I just wanted to briefly play the first part of the CNN piece again, where in a town
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:22.920]  I'm guaranteed it is federal, folks. This is where they're getting the ideas,
[1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:26.120]  where they're getting the training. Oh, there's been a few shootings. So don't leave your house
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:32.200]  even during the day. Don't even be in your yard. Forget what Jellaby Opera joked about,
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:37.560]  you know, 15 years ago about don't leave your subdivision sectors. No, no, no, no. And of
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:42.360]  course, under Homeland Security, it is neighborhood watch spying on you, watching you. So here it is.
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:46.840]  Because of all the recent crime in Helena, West Helena, we're talking about robberies,
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:50.920]  home invasions, loitering, shootings. The mayor of Helena, West Helena,
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:55.960]  has decided to impose a curfew, but only in certain areas. And that applies for everyone,
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:00.200]  no matter the age and no matter the time. If you're caught violating curfew,
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:04.600]  there's a chance you could wind up behind bars. We're afraid that somebody's going to get seriously
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:11.880]  hurt by what's going on. This curfew for all people. Everybody's subject to stopping investigation.
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:17.560]  It's almost akin to martial law. And that's exactly what some are calling it. For now,
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:22.200]  Second Street and several streets surrounding it will look just like this. And if you're caught
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:27.080]  outside without a good enough excuse, zero tolerance, they're going to jail. An idea that's
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:31.480]  fine by Martha Coleman. You never know where a bullet is going to go. All right, there we go.
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:35.880]  Stop it there. Now, oh, where a bullet's going to go. Like these magic bullets are flying around
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:40.040]  like the Kennedy assassination. I looked it up. There's been a couple murders the last few months
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:43.960]  there. It's drug dealers shooting each other. The government ships in the drugs to create the crisis
[1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:48.920]  to begin with. And they will selectively day or night decide if you're allowed to be out or
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:53.000]  you'll be taken into the FEMA camp. And they train your children going back for a decade,
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.120]  had a load on the bus during a FEMA drill. They don't tell the parents about it.
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:01.320]  They make them defecate staying in the classroom for eight hours in trash cans in front of everyone.
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:05.240]  No lunch is given to them under federal grants to quote, teach them what martial law is like.
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:13.080]  In 1998, Swansboro happened up there. It also happened in the Hobbs Middle School in Pensacola.
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:17.720]  That happened in 98. The Marines came in and said, put the kids against the wall with guns,
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:20.920]  wouldn't let them have food all day and said, the federal government wants you to know what
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:26.280]  martial law is like. And I've got those articles. I, of course, covered that back in 1998. This
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:31.160]  is going on everywhere. And it's, it's, it's incrementally training you how to live in a total
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:36.600]  police state. I was asked by an Austin police officer what I was doing in the mall yesterday.
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:40.360]  He walked over and said, Alex, what are you doing? What are you doing here? I'm supposed to
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:43.640]  fill the radio. And I thought he was joking. I smiled at him. He kind of looked at me like,
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:50.280]  what are you doing here? I said, I'm buying a pair of sunglasses. So that's America,
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:55.400]  ladies and gentlemen. That's what things have turned into in this country. And they've built
[1:12:55.400 --> 1:13:00.520]  the FEMA emergency management centers, the fusion centers, the local emergency centers are really
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:05.400]  federal, moving the National Guard into them. This is the last decade plus, a long curved
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:10.840]  operation. It doesn't matter what administration's in this. They use the neocons as fronts. There's
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:15.560]  a darker military industrial complex owned by the private banks above us. For the next hour
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:20.840]  and 45 minutes, we're joined by Webster Griffin Tarbley. I wanted to get his take on what happened
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:25.640]  in Russia and Georgia. I wanted to get his analysis of the ongoing political campaign.
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:28.360]  Now that looks like Hillary's going to be the running mate of Barack Obama. How can
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:33.960]  that be the woman in shining armor with the evil Barack Obama? It's all stage folks.
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:38.120]  And also want to get his take on the martial law. In fact, let's talk about this gearing up into
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:44.440]  the police state, this martial law being incrementally accelerated and ratcheted up here in the US.
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:48.360]  Webster, good to have you on. Hello, Alex. How are you? You bet. I should have. We're also
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:54.040]  carrying your new book, Obama, the Postmodern Coup. We have a few left. The first edition's
[1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:58.680]  almost sold out. Second, about to come out, but we have it available at infowars.com. Webster,
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:03.080]  first, what you heard singing in. It's not just the point of the martial law in the town,
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:08.440]  but the fact that they're just announcing it like it's a good thing and normal on national news.
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:13.400]  I would recommend that we supplement awareness of everything that you've said,
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:19.000]  which of course is real and valid, with another dimension, which is not the top down police
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:24.760]  state dictatorial totalitarian dimension, but the fascist dimension. And this is fundamentally
[1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:33.880]  different. This is a grassroots, anti-authoritarian movement of goons, thugs, hooligans, and
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:42.040]  fervently idealistic students. A lot of them left liberals, lemmings, zombies, kool-aid drinkers,
[1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:47.000]  Manson cultists, Hare Krishna's, whatever you want to call it. That is the Obama campaign.
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:55.080]  The history of fascism indicates that a point is reached where the army, well, first of all,
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:15:03.160]  where the police are not enough to quell a mass upsurge. The army cannot be relied on because
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:08.360]  the history of rulers is that you send in a division and it goes over to the revolutionary
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:13.000]  side. And you've got to bring in the youth brigade. You've got to give the petty masses,
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:18.440]  petty power. And that's exactly, but my point is, is that we can blame this on Obama. I'm not
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:22.920]  saying he's good, Webster. The point is, going back at least 25 years, they've had a slow creep
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:28.840]  into getting citizens involved in the Tattletale squads into the enforcement squads. Now they're
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:35.560]  co-opting the environmental movement to be their enforcement squads. So we're absolutely right.
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:40.600]  My point is, you're saying Obama, Obama, and I agree he's the figurehead for a very, very
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:46.680]  violent form of this. But, you know, going back to George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, they've been
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:52.680]  setting up, McCain's called for youth brigades now. Go ahead. I would just say that Obama is,
[1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:57.880]  if you look at the political landscape, there's only one political figure with a mass-based
[1:15:57.880 --> 1:16:03.480]  fascist movement. And that's Obama. McCain doesn't have one. Bush doesn't have one. It's a joke.
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:08.600]  Clinton doesn't have one. No other Democrat has one. I've just spent the weekend at the Puma
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:14.600]  Convention here in Washington, D.C. This is the anti-Obama Democrats. And I think this is an
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:19.720]  extremely useful thing to fight Obama up to the time of the convention, to try to stop him at
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:24.440]  the convention. And if he gets the Democratic nomination, then to defeat him. I think this is,
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:29.480]  this is real, it's a real distinction. History shows that there's a huge difference between
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:35.320]  just another bourgeois politician, no matter how bellicose, no matter how oppressive, no matter
[1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:41.320]  how corrupt, and something that gets you into fascism. With Obama, you've got something like
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:48.840]  a green core. You've got a homeland security core. And you've got Al Gore's famous green army.
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:53.400]  So the difference is one way the FBI comes and harasses you or the kinds of things you were
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:58.760]  talking about. The other side is a gang of goons and thugs come and burn you out and kill you
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:06.360]  or lynch you or whatever it is. And the idea is that the police state gets popular cover,
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:11.800]  anti-authoritarian or even left or radical cover, out of the fact that you've got these
[1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:17.960]  Obama bots that are in action. I heard stories from people who had been in the Texas Democratic
[1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:24.680]  caucuses, as well as the Iowa ones. The way that Obama won those caucuses is with intimidation,
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:30.120]  with threats, with locking the doors, with pushing people, beating them up in some cases,
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:35.800]  threatening to beat them up. And when you go to the internet, people who have been blogging
[1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:41.720]  against Obama report that they are getting massive cyber warfare, denial of service attacks,
[1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:45.800]  attempts to overwhelm their cell phones, and so on down the line. And then in Germany,
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:51.400]  they ordered the Germans to not allow any signs. Pro-Or-Con and the police did beat up people
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:56.920]  with signs that are under Obama's orders. Yes, right. And this is just amazing. So
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:18:02.120]  I would say you basically have two classes of politicians. You have the old-style ones,
[1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:05.880]  however bad they are. Of course, they're very bad, as you're pointing out. But the Bushes,
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:11.160]  the McCain, the Clintons, that's one thing. That's bad enough. But then when you get into the area
[1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:19.800]  of this scurrilous, gutter, snipe, thug, goon, and permanently idealistic student, a swarming
[1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:25.480]  adolescent, rent a mob, doop a mob, then you've crossed a qualitative dividing line. The people
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:31.000]  who lived in Italy in 1922 or Germany 1933 kept saying, gee, we thought we were under
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  fascism, but now we realize we weren't. And now we are, and this has been a tremendous deterioration,
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:42.040]  and now it's too late to roll it back because the genius of fascism, of course, is that it
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:47.800]  goes out and destroys the institutions that might resist the things that you're talking about. So far,
[1:18:47.800 --> 1:18:51.640]  not that many institutions have been crushed by the measures that you're talking about,
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:53.960]  but with Obama and the Green Corps, that will begin.
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:57.880]  Well, let's try to say the mainstream media, the corporates, have been behind him. So that's
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:07.160]  the big strike against him. And you are right in saying that he's the only one that gives
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:11.720]  any support to the government and the corrupt system. And I've heard mainstream pundits say
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:18.920]  that we need Obama to bring people back into government, back into trusting the state,
[1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:24.360]  into infusing it with new blood. And so he would give a new lease on life to the New World Order.
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:29.160]  They also say that right now they complain, that Andrew Sullivan complained in the Atlantic
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:34.520]  magazine last December in an issue with Obama on the cover, that we can't have any false flags
[1:19:34.520 --> 1:19:40.120]  because nobody believes Bush. And if Bush tries to false flag, they'll think he's lying or that
[1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:45.000]  he did it himself. We need Obama to refresh the credibility of false flags so we can have new
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:50.840]  ones. And then the White House said that Obama will be tested by, quote, an attack.
[1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:55.720]  Then he composes a savior when we're hit by a nuke or a bio weapon and then be our new dictator.
[1:19:55.720 --> 1:20:00.200]  And after all, he's black. So blacks can do no wrong. Everything's going to be fine.
[1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:04.120]  Webster Tarbley, stay there. Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:08.680]  Loose change, final cut. Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement. The true story of
[1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:14.120]  the Bilderberg group, the late great USA, America, freedom to fascism. These are just a few of the

[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:15.400]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[1:21:15.400 --> 1:21:19.480]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:24.360]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:30.760]  since they reside the world over. They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the new world order.
[1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:35.560]  They oppose everything that is God and truth. They are of the line that was disinherited
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:40.760]  2,000 years ago, everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:45.240]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and
[1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:51.320]  mankind. We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us. Visit our website

[1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:21.560]  At Japan's cut in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies, the bond market continues to slump.
[1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:26.760]  J.P. Morgan gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler. Housing sales fell 6.6 percent.
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:31.480]  Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle and upper class.
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:36.040]  Investors cast out on investment banks credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders or
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:40.840]  skyrocketing due to the increased risk. The U.S. dollar is free falling against foreign currencies
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:44.920]  and countries that previously financed the U.S. are now seeking safer alternatives.

[1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:32.200]  All right, Webster, let's keep going with Obama. I want to break down what elite is behind him,
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:36.600]  but I really want to get your expertise because you know a lot about Eastern Europe,
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:43.640]  Central Asia, the Caucasus, and what we just saw in the last five days with the sneak attack
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:50.520]  by the Georgians back by NATO, the U.S. and the Israelis against the Russians and
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:56.440]  what's unfolding there, but continue with Barack Obama accelerating towards the convention where
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:03.160]  Herr Hillary is scheduled to be his running mate. I really doubt she'll be his running mate. I don't
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:07.560]  see much indication of that. Really, Bill Clinton is going to be introducing the VP?
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:15.320]  Well, I don't believe so. I think there's a profound hatred by the Wall Street groups themselves
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:20.360]  of Mrs. Clinton because they've put all their money into Obama. It's about a third of a billion
[1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:25.880]  dollars so far, and they've been stabbing Clinton in the back. Clinton, up until about December,
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:30.200]  had seemed to be the candidate of Wall Street, but that turned out not to be the case.
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:37.880]  So what you've got now is the Rockefeller, Soros, Bilderberg, Trilateral, Rand Corporation,
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:43.640]  Council on Formulations, Skull and Bones, Chicago School, Foundations.
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:49.560]  Guys of the Ford Foundation. All of this aligning. You can hear the foundations, by the way, on
[1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:54.200]  National Public Radio. If you want to know what the foundations think, we have Foundation-funded
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:26:01.560]  oligarch radio, NPR, and PBS on the TV. Whatever Bill Moyers does, he's the spokesman for this
[1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:08.840]  huge power of the family fund that are now in constant in the foundations. So you're
[1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:14.200]  sending Bill Moyers is bad. Yes, absolutely. He was the spokesman for Johnson. He was
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:19.880]  selling the Vietnam War back then, and he is, I think, one of the leading operatives
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:26.200]  of this foundation universe, which is what has produced Obama. Obama is a racist provocateur,
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:33.560]  a race-bater or race-monger, or I would say poverty pimp, when Obama says he was a community
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:41.320]  organizer. What in the world does that mean? I was a poverty, he was a race, a community organizer
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:47.480]  for the Gamaliel Foundation, which is funded by the Ford Foundation using Alinsky doctrines.
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:51.960]  What does that mean? It means that he's a counterinsurgent. He's a wrecker. He's a police
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:57.080]  agent sent into those communities to fragment them, to pit one group against another. Well,
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:02.840]  I agree. Look at what the Great Society did. It basically destroyed. You had Black illegitimacy
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:09.320]  at 10%. Now it's over 90%. It's totally wrecked those communities, and we know, going back to
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:14.600]  Margaret Sanger with the letters to the Colgate's and others saying, we've got to hire Blacks
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:19.480]  to go in so we can sterilize them and kill them. These Black weeds only trust other Blacks. So we've
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:25.320]  got to create a cadre of foundation Blacks that serve us. Yeah, this is a factor. I would have
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:31.080]  a point to the great turning point in the United States history. The great U-turn is under Carter,
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:36.360]  and Carter, of course, is a trilateral puppet, selected by Brzezinski personally, approved by
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:40.840]  David Rockefeller, a similar operation to what we have today. Jimmy, who comes out of nowhere...
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:43.640]  Why did they destroy him then? I mean, I don't think Carter himself's bad.
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:49.240]  Carter is bad, yes. Carter, we look at those speeches. Go back and look at the Mele's speech.
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:54.680]  Go back and look at Carter's rage at the American people saying, the energy crisis is real,
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:59.320]  and you better believe it. Now, this is also very interesting in terms of trilateral mentality.
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:07.720]  Carter's famous Mele's speech, The Crisis of Spirit of July 1979, is essentially an incompetent,
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:14.840]  failed president, blaming the American people for the fact that we have an incompetent ruling elite.
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:20.840]  The Wall Street ruling class is incompetent. They are incapable of governing. They have destroyed
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:26.520]  the greatest economic power in the world, and this is precisely the point. Under Carter,
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:33.560]  you have Brzezinski running this lunatic, adventurous, anti-Soviet, pro-Islamic fundamentalist
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:38.040]  foreign policy featuring Khomeini. That's one side. The other side, of course, is Paul Adolf
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:44.200]  Volcker at the Federal Reserve with a 22% prime rate, the highest in American history, at least
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:49.800]  recent history. And, of course, for most of us, 22% is the prime rate. We don't get that. We get
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:55.640]  30% or 35%. And this is, of course, when the racket of credit card usually began.
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:01.240]  And it is when the United States began to deindustrialize, the factories that could not
[1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:08.040]  be destroyed by Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Stalin, and Mao were destroyed by voters that were literally
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:12.680]  died of it. Yeah, it's the neoliberal deindustrialization for control of the population, neocertum.
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:19.240]  And the idea of a low-wage economy, union-busting, the labor movement in full retreat.
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:24.360]  But all covered with envelope, all covered with an envelope of liberalism.
[1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:30.600]  And left covered. This is exactly it. Under environmentalism, the limits of growth,
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:36.440]  the era of scarcity, and, of course, in foreign policy, human rights and humanitarian concerns.
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:40.360]  Stay there. I totally agree with you on the analysis. And we want to get all your perspectives
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:45.560]  on it. Let's explain to people this whole Malthusian social Darwinistic world system
[1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:48.360]  and how it controls both the left and the right. And break that down.
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:51.880]  We're on the
[1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:11.080]  Too many kids are what's making planet worse. A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:13.720]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:21.160]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:25.880]  pediatrics. These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually
[1:30:25.880 --> 1:30:30.760]  be associated with improved behavior and mental performance. Fluoride in water is supposed to
[1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:34.280]  fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:39.800]  The government had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public
[1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:44.360]  under a specific condition. We have to work with dark side while we spend time in the shadows.
[1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:51.480]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well, join me. I'm glad to
[1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:59.880]  sit here at the right hand to say there's a need for a new world order. Someday, in the next few years,
[1:30:59.880 --> 1:31:09.480]  a solution will emerge.
[1:31:52.920 --> 1:31:58.200]  Okay, Webster, I'm going to turn the mic off here and give you the floor. I think we should
[1:31:58.200 --> 1:32:03.080]  start at the beginning here about where this new world order comes from, who they really are,
[1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:07.480]  so people don't get confused by all the left cover, right cover, to bring us up to today
[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:12.760]  with Barack Obama, who I agree with you is probably the biggest threat to liberty, only
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:17.160]  because of the figurehead and the cover he gives them, not that he actually runs anything or not
[1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:21.400]  that I'm saying McCain's a good guy. So start at the beginning if you can.
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:29.080]  And because of the fascist mass movement, or again, reasonable facsimile of a fascist mass
[1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:35.160]  movement, which Obama has been able to mobilize and no other. This is the qualitative distinction.
[1:32:35.160 --> 1:32:41.480]  This is why Obama is far and away the worst possible outcome and needs to be opposed
[1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:47.000]  in any possible way. I wouldn't call it the new world order. I call it Anglo-American World Empire,
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:52.280]  U.S.-British World Domination. This is what it is. There are, of course,
[1:32:52.280 --> 1:32:55.880]  New York Park. But it was just arose by any other name, Webster. I've been erupt here.
[1:32:55.880 --> 1:33:01.560]  No, but that's what they call it. It's branded as that. So yes, World Empire, run by the Anglo-American
[1:33:01.560 --> 1:33:06.680]  Power Axis, is the proper term, but I mean, new world order is what it's known as.
[1:33:06.680 --> 1:33:11.880]  Well, again, let me call it Anglo-American World Empire, because I think it gets the idea.
[1:33:11.880 --> 1:33:16.040]  There are, of course, others that are allied with it. The European Union, the Eurogarchs,
[1:33:16.040 --> 1:33:21.800]  are largely submissive to this. Russia is not submissive. I think it makes no sense at all
[1:33:21.800 --> 1:33:27.240]  to say Putin and Medvedev now are figures of the new world order. They are not. They are opponents
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:34.040]  as much as they can be of this Anglo-American World Empire. China is in a somewhat more
[1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:40.040]  ambiguous position in terms of what you see, but we have reliable reports that underneath it,
[1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:47.080]  the Chinese are even more hostile to the continued Anglo-American World domination and they're
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:53.880]  biding their time. So I regard these guys. I welcome the existence of the Shanghai Cooperation
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:34:00.040]  Organization, which has posed a counterweight to the U.S. and the British. I would say without
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:04.840]  Putin, we would have had a police state here already, because it is the existence of this
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:11.000]  international opposition that prevents the Wall Street group from imposing what they want here.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.720]  The problem we have right now, the strategic constellation that Obama comes out of,
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:23.240]  is that we've had the incompetent and disastrous administration of Bush Cheney and the Neocons.
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:29.080]  Now, their approach is, the world is focused on the Middle East. Everything revolves around
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:33.560]  Israel. You've got to destroy the leading Arab state. You've got to destroy the leading Islamic
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:41.720]  state. I guess Iraq and Iran. You've got to go into Afghanistan primarily on an anti-Islamic
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:47.000]  mission. There's a, the Brzezinski would say, do go there, but not for that. And therefore,
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:54.520]  this has been played out now under the bankrupt and idiotic mythology of 9-11, which you've
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:35:01.240]  done so much to expose and some of the rest of us have also tried to do this. The thing is,
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:06.200]  you're getting to the point of diminishing returns with that. It is simply impossible to keep going
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:12.120]  with the 9-11 Islamovashism, bin Laden, al-Qaeda, war on terror. There's even this report from
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:17.400]  the Rand Corporation, where Brzezinski did this, you need something new. Now, here's an, it's an
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:22.680]  interesting case. Normally, when people talk about the Hegelian dialectic in politics, I think this
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:28.440]  is much overstated. The British are really not fair. It's very crude, divide and conquer. But who
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:35.880]  was a professor, trained in Germany. He wrote a book about the 17th century, the age of the Baroque,
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:41.160]  and with Brzezinski co-authored some books about totalitarianism, targeting, of course,
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:48.600]  the Soviets, anti-Russian. Alfred Weber, so Alfred Weber is the younger brother of Max Weber,
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:56.600]  Max Weber, the German sociologist around, you know, from about 1890 to 1920. He was extremely
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:36:00.680]  influential. The guy wrote books about the Protestant ethic and all kinds of other things.
[1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:08.040]  In Alfred Weber, there is a Hegelian philosophy of history elements. So the idea simply is,
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:15.000]  you cannot be Johnny OneNote. You cannot do your operations always under right wing militaristic
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:20.760]  pop-down cover. You've got to modulate that, and we're now in the middle of a modulation.
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:27.960]  Carter was a similar phase. Carter dropped the usual Cold War stuff, but he continued it in the
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:33.560]  more ferocious form under the guise of human rights, humanitarianism, and interfering in the
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:39.080]  internal affairs of countries. Carter was also on a worldwide vendetta to shut down peaceful
[1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:45.480]  nuclear energy development, but under left cover. Not saying we want you to be puppets of our empire,
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:52.360]  but saying we don't like nuclear energy. So we reach a point by about 2006, 2007,
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:58.600]  where the Anglo-American ruling class says, Bush and Cheney are crazy. The neocons are bankrupt.
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:03.960]  We're not getting anywhere. We cannot have the US, the British, and the Israelis at war with the
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:10.280]  world forever. It doesn't work. We're too bankrupt. We're too isolated. Our armies are defeated
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:15.800]  and demoralized. Our populations are extremely rested. We've got a possible mass upsurge
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:21.720]  around impeachment and anti-Bush, anti-Cheney, and the war, and all this. So basically they say,
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:28.200]  let's repeat the Carter operation. They had been grooming Obama, in my view, since about 1981
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:34.200]  to 1983, when Obama and Brzezinski were together on the campus of Columbia University,
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:41.880]  Morningside Heights in Manhattan, and recruited him as far as I can see. I would hope that Obama
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:47.400]  would comment on this if he doesn't like this particular view of his background, but he's
[1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:55.160]  one of a series of controlled assets. Devalpatrick of Massachusetts, who spouts the self-same rhetoric,
[1:37:55.160 --> 1:37:59.720]  is another one. And there are undoubtedly other options, not all black, to be sure.
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:07.480]  Or others, southern governors, or northern, gritty populists, or whatever, but all controlled by
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:14.280]  this trilateral commission. So now the idea is, they're basically twofold. If you're going to
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:21.320]  continue Anglo-American world domination, the US, UK, world empire, you've got to deal with the
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:26.600]  fact that you've got this Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russia, China, Terry Power,
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:31.880]  and the tremendous energy power, the Chinese, the greatest demographic power in terms of people,
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:38.440]  and the highest rates of economic development. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is a magnet.
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:43.640]  It's the counterpoll. Anybody who doesn't like the Anglo-Americans, for example, especially in
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:48.280]  Africa, if you're an African state, you have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
[1:38:48.840 --> 1:38:53.480]  trying to crush you, destroy you, loot you. The Chinese come along and say, let's make deals
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:59.480]  50-50. It's not humanitarianism, but it's business, and it's much better to have an alternative,
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:04.440]  right, as it was possible during the Cold War. So Brzezinski basically says,
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:09.400]  we've got to crush Russia and China. How do you do that? Well, it goes like this.
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:13.800]  First, kick the Chinese out of Africa. That's why you've got the US-African command.
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:18.600]  You've got the destabilization of Kenya by Obama's cousin, Odinga, who is the,
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:25.560]  I call him the killer luo. He's the necklicker of Kenya. The luos, by the way, with the luos,
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:31.960]  it's a little bit like the Kurds. You can destabilize Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda,
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:38.600]  and Congo. You can destabilize five countries using these luos that Obama happens to represent.
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:43.560]  So you've got to kick the Chinese out. The interest in Zimbabwe is, of course,
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:47.800]  that's where the Chinese get their minerals. So the US and the British say, oh,
[1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:53.720]  it's a humanitarian emergency. Mugabe is a bad man. Let's get rid of him. Real reason, Chinese
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:59.400]  minerals. Sudan, the best example, the biggest country in Africa. That's about 7% of the Chinese
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:05.800]  oil. Therefore, the Anglo-Americans gin up this Darfur crisis, which is real, but not created by
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:11.480]  the Sudanese government. It's partly a feature of the world oil price and starvation and so forth
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:16.760]  going on there. But the first phase, therefore, is try to destroy every Chinese ally you can
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:23.800]  in Africa, kick the Chinese out, cut off the oil in the minerals, destroy places like Burma,
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:30.760]  Chinese ally, and destroy Pakistan. Carve Pakistan into four to five pieces. Even though the current
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:37.800]  government of Pakistan is Anglo-American puppets, the conducting of the Afghan war is now only
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:43.720]  targeting, really, Pakistan, bombing Pakistan, humiliating the government, and preparing the
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:49.960]  breakup of that country. Why? It is a natural ally of China against India, always has been,
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:56.040]  and it's important commercial partner. The end game is, once you've got China stripped of allies
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:41:02.280]  and isolated, Brzezinski says to the Chinese, look, you want oil, you want minerals, go and get
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:08.280]  them in Siberia. Go to war with Russia, invade Siberia, and you can get everything you want.
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:13.480]  Siberia has lots of minerals, lots of oil, very few Russians. Let's have World War Three.
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:19.800]  Now, it means, therefore, play China against Russia, destroy them both, get rid of them both,
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:23.880]  and the U.S. and the British can have another 100 years of world domination.
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:31.720]  This is exactly the same project we had with Lady Astor, Lord Astor, the Clifton set in Britain.
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:35.160]  It's the great game of the Biden-Conqueror, simply put.
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:40.120]  Lord Lothian, Lord Halifax, Lord Brand, Prescott Bush, John Foster Dulles,
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:44.840]  Lord Montague Norman of the Bank of England, Sir Henry Duterte of Royal Dutch Shell,
[1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:49.800]  and they basically said, we'll call this appeasement, but it's not appeasement, it's war.
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:54.360]  Let's build up Hitler and we'll point him east. We'll encourage him to go here.
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:57.720]  And that's all on record with Lord Milner and the Milner group, and the rest of them.
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:03.400]  Absolutely. That's exactly it. The Milner group is the Clifton set. That's a different name for it
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:08.360]  in the later phase. And this is Carol Quigley and many others. I can give you a story
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:12.440]  and for the British Round Table group. Yeah, but he does tell you the story,
[1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:17.560]  and he presents it as bad because, of course, it didn't work. So their idea is play Hitler
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:22.440]  against Stalin and get rid of both of them that way. And we can have another hundred years of
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:27.640]  the British Empire. Now, it didn't work because, of course, you get Hitler making the Hitler-Stalin
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:34.440]  pact and then turning west and destroying the French and the Scandinavians and the Low Countries
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:38.760]  and so forth. And the British get themselves into a fix. They're going to be destroyed unless the
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:43.720]  US comes to save them. So that's one of the reasons that Winston Churchill was the main
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:49.240]  beneficiary of Pearl Harbor, and I believe did the most to make sure that this was a surprise attack.
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:53.880]  Yeah, but then you see Tarbley. I agree with all this analysis, but then you throw in that
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:58.520]  Roosevelt was a good guy when we know he put in the oil embargoes.
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:04.040]  Absolutely. I mean, let me just throw this out, though, and then get your take on it.
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:12.920]  You have Roosevelt putting the oil embargo on the Japanese. You have Roosevelt intensifying
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:19.960]  military action through the group stage set up after the Boxer Rebellion into the flying
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:26.920]  Tigers to engage militarily the Japanese US trained forces and even US pilots, quote, as
[1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:35.080]  contractors, start engaging and start shooting down Japanese bombers, Japanese officers.
[1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:39.400]  They start attacking Japanese airfields. So for those who don't know, the US through
[1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:46.920]  basically the Halliburton or the Blackwater of the day attacked in Southern China and in
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:52.600]  surrounding areas, Japanese forces. Then, of course, a week before they get the codes,
[1:43:52.600 --> 1:43:56.040]  they know they're about to launch the attack. The British know, wait a minute,
[1:43:56.040 --> 1:44:01.400]  the British know the US does not know. This is the point. The British have the Japanese.
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:04.520]  Is that why the four submarines attacked Pearl Harbor and they were ordered to still stand
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:11.800]  down? The Japanese Naval Code, JN 28, had been broken by the British. The Purple Code,
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:17.080]  the diplomatic code had been broken by the US. So the US knew an attack was probably imminent,
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:23.000]  but not where or when. The Honolulu Advertiser Webster ran a headline a week before saying
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:26.680]  that Japanese will attack Pearl Harbor on December 7th. Yeah, and then that's
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:31.480]  our military didn't know though. Here's the problem, Tarpley. I wonder why the commanders
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:37.240]  didn't send out some picket boats, you know, some trawlers. Listen. Stop, stop, stop. Just
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:41.320]  for a second, Tarpley. I totally look. I know you're a great historian, smart guy. It's why
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:45.640]  we have you here. It's why I sell your books. I like you, but I'm really trying to get down
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:51.960]  to fundamentals here because you have this historical perspective that Roosevelt's a great
[1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:58.040]  guy and we do have on one end the Bush, Nazi, Milner angle, trying to overthrow him as they
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:03.800]  brought Hitler to power right around the same time in 35, 36 here in the United States. So there's
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:09.080]  truth to what you're saying, but there's a subtler. Just like you said, left cover, the same interests
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:13.160]  were also hedging their bets with Roosevelt. So this whole thing about Roosevelt being a good guy,
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:19.400]  I just don't buy into remember that the relation of the Morgan group to Roosevelt is that they
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:25.560]  tried to kill him in Miami before he was inaugurated. They tried to organize a coup against him
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:31.960]  in the form of the Morgan coup, the Mussolini style march on Washington, this medley butler,
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:36.520]  revelations and so forth, the Dick Stein committee. And according to Elliott Roosevelt,
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:42.200]  the Churchill gang poisoned Roosevelt and killed him so that the British could launch the Cold War
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:47.480]  in the wake of this, just on the Japanese question. The argument that you make depends on the idea
[1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:52.520]  that the Japanese are a benign power. The Japanese are not saying they're a benign, hold on, hold on,
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:56.600]  I'm not saying they're a benign power. I'm saying they were, but see that's what brought the U.S.
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:46:01.720]  into the war. That's what I brought up Japan was, was, was the British screaming for help.
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:06.760]  And now the U.S. comes in after the Pearl Harbor attack. I'm saying there was total
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:13.480]  coordination between the Anglo-American establishment, the British and the U.S. government
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:18.920]  through Roosevelt, bringing the Imperial Japanese into that. I recommend the book by
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:24.760]  Russ Bridger and Maeve, which explains this question of the codes, that the British had
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:30.520]  broken the Japanese naval code, but did not share the details of where the attack would come.
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:36.200]  That's admitted. But the British therefore, the other problem is, the people who were
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:41.240]  controlling the intelligence were Stimson of Wall Street and of the invisible government,
[1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:45.800]  and Marshall, similarly. The question is, they cut off intelligence to Roosevelt.
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:50.920]  It's not that Roosevelt didn't give the Navy the intelligence. This is, this is, this is crazy.
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:57.640]  It is that the, the commanders and the bubble, this, there's a guy called Admiral Richmond K.
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:02.760]  Turner in the Navy Department, who is the, the Marplot, the inside operative and all this.
[1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:05.080]  He is the one who withholds the, uh...
[1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:10.760]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history
[1:47:10.760 --> 1:47:16.760]  comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that

[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:29.800]  Webster Tarbling author is our guest, author of the new book,
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:34.680]  Rock Obama, Postmodern Coup, available at infowars.com.
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:42.440]  His historical analysis is spot on. I agree with him. I trust but verify.
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:48.680]  I just disagree, Webster, with your analysis. It's all rancid. They're all bad. Hillary's
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:55.240]  bad. John McCain's bad. I know you know that. But saying that we have to throw support in behind
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:51:00.440]  Hillary or then McCain later, which is the same thing that so many others are saying,
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:07.640]  I just can't do it. I can't support the false paradigm of the left-right
[1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:12.360]  or any of these people. And if fascism's to come, let Barack Obama and his greenie-meanies
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:18.360]  bring it. Let them try to come burn me out. We got guns in this country. And maybe that's what
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:24.520]  we need is to go ahead. Worse is better. Bring this thing to a head. What do you expect to see
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:27.480]  the way the land is right now? Let's hear some predictions from Webster Tarbling.
[1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:32.680]  I'd say that one of the obvious things built into an Obama presidency is the possibility
[1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:40.680]  of domestic civil war coming through a number of scenarios. I would just say I have a great
[1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:46.040]  grandfather who fought at Gettysburg in the Valley of Death there by the Devil's Den and
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:53.480]  Little Round Top in the 11th United States regulars of the Sykes Fifth Corps Second Division.
[1:51:54.360 --> 1:52:01.800]  Civil war is the worst possible outcome. Nothing but nothing is worse than civil war.
[1:52:01.800 --> 1:52:06.440]  And I think that's the problem. No, the CPS taking people's children and putting
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:10.120]  sodium fluoride in the water. We're all under total war. You know about the
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:14.920]  eugenic system. Webster, you're an expert on that. Sure. But again, I think that there are
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:20.920]  peaceful ways out of this. Well, I want a peaceful way out of this too. The method that I recommend
[1:52:20.920 --> 1:52:27.800]  is to build a mass movement through mobilization. And mobilization has to involve the choice of
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:33.160]  intermediate goals. In other words, things that people can do. Right now, it is to stop Obama.
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:40.520]  And that means practically speaking, blocking with other forces that might oppose
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:47.240]  Obama. And again, this is based on the history of Italy 1922, 1933. For example,
[1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:51.560]  in the German case, you had a lot of people saying, why don't the communists and the
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:56.920]  social democrats form a bloc and stop Hitler? For many reasons, they didn't do it. They had
[1:52:56.920 --> 1:53:02.360]  all good reasons. They said the other side is really bad and really corrupt and really awful.
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:07.960]  And then once Hitler came to power, they kept saying, well, I wish we had done it. But let me
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:14.280]  just continue the thing I was trying to do about the world situation. Part of it is now
[1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:20.200]  this question of attempting to repeat the maneuver of the appeasers, right, the Nebel Chamberlain
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:25.160]  policy, which was not appeasement, but war. In other words, when Obama says he wants to
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:30.520]  negotiate with Iran, he wants to use Iran exactly the same way that Brzezinski is now
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:35.720]  using Georgia. In other words, play Iran against the Russians. That's his future for Iran.
[1:53:35.720 --> 1:53:40.840]  Brzezinski says, why should I attack them? I can use them to attack the Russians and get rid
[1:53:40.840 --> 1:53:45.960]  of all of them that way. And ultimately, the crowning achievement is China against Russia,
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:51.240]  except it won't work. The other side now. But Iran's getting along with Russia.
[1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:54.600]  Who? Iran has been getting along with Russia.
[1:53:54.600 --> 1:54:01.240]  Look, if you know any Iranians, ask them the following question. What country is most hated
[1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:07.640]  in Iran? And every time I've asked this question, which I ask habitually, it's always Russia.
[1:54:07.640 --> 1:54:14.120]  Russia, remember, occupied Northern Iran during World War II as part of the Lend-Lease program.
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:19.800]  There was a military corridor going through Iran. The British occupied the South,
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:25.640]  the Soviets, the North. Now, the Soviets behaved badly. They were very angry about Hitler and so
[1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:32.760]  forth. No, the Soviets did bad things. I thought they were sweet. And the residue of that is a
[1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:36.520]  hatred that Brzezinski thinks he can build on. Well, I mean, you've got the Russians in there
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:41.480]  with the Chinese building the reactors. I don't know. All right. Well, I know they think that
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:53.400]  Webster is just all delusional. We'll be right back. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:54:56.200 --> 1:55:01.160]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[1:55:01.160 --> 1:55:05.640]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:10.680]  New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you?
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:17.880]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CNR. The day that we stop asking questions
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:22.600]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:29.800]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job.
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:38.360]  How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:41.560]  yourself. Oh, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:46.680]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:47.080]  of 9-11.
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:53.160]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:55.720]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:56:06.840]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:17.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:26.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:31.000]  You know, there's so many subjects. I'm going to talk to Webster Tarpley about very thought-provoking
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.160]  discussions. We're just keeping for two more hours. He's agreed to do that. We appreciate that.
[1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:40.760]  Author of Obama the Postmodernist Coup, available at infowars.com. We're going to open the phones
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:46.360]  up in the final hour today. For the next hour, I want to get his analysis, which he really is an
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.960]  expert on Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, Russia, the Middle East, Central Asia.
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:56.200]  I want to get about 30 minutes of analysis from him on that. And then I want to, he is
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:00.120]  one of the few people, the reason I really recognized him in my own research a decade ago,
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:05.000]  was he got into the eugenics, the driving force, the social Darwinism of the elite, their true
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:09.560]  propulsion system. So we'll talk with him the last 30 minutes of the show and then open phones
[1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:14.360]  in the last hour. Take a lot of your calls coming up in about 58 minutes.
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:18.200]  But Webster, you wanted to finish up with the austerity movement, how they have the environmental
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:23.640]  movement, the austerity movement, the secret police system they're setting up, all of this
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:30.520]  massive decades-long planning coming to a head with the golden boy, literally, there to save us
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:36.280]  all and bring the left in for the final police state. We've talked now, I guess, about the foreign
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:40.920]  policy. In other words, this Brzezinski plan in many world capitals, especially Moscow,
[1:57:40.920 --> 1:57:46.840]  especially Beijing, if you say Brzezinski plan, it's a plan, therefore, that has an endgame,
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:54.280]  China reduced to warlords, 20 to 25 centers of power, as it was in the 1920s.
[1:57:55.160 --> 1:58:02.600]  And Russia also divided up, as it was during the Russian Civil War of 1919 to 1920,
[1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:08.920]  ultimately coming in with about four to five different states, different countries. So,
[1:58:08.920 --> 1:58:15.640]  we had the Bernard Lewis plan for the Middle East, right-carb Iraq, three ways, Iran, six ways,
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:20.760]  Lebanon, several ways, Turkey, three or four ways, Sudan, at least two ways, maybe more.
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:24.840]  But then, to apply that to Russia and China, so that's one thing.
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:31.320]  Now, the other side is the domestic and the austerity. When you see Obama giving this speech
[1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:35.880]  in Oregon, when he had his outburst there, he said,
[1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:41.560]  you're not going to be able to drive an SUV, all right? You're not going to be able to eat
[1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:47.160]  as much as you want. This is amazing. You're not going to be able to eat as much as you want,
[1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:53.080]  and you can't keep your thermostat set where you want it at 72 degrees and think that the world
[1:58:53.080 --> 1:58:57.720]  will allow you to do this. Now, and then in Germany, he said, called for a new world order
[1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:02.600]  last week, and he also, or a new international order, and he also said, you're going to have
[1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:08.280]  to work more and serve this global system. So he told us, it was really a slave master's speech.
[1:59:08.280 --> 1:59:14.920]  This is what I would call killer austerity, genocidal austerity, a further cut in the U.S.
[1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:22.920]  standard of living of 30, 40, 50% as much as he can. Imagine a government policy of
[1:59:23.560 --> 1:59:27.160]  not having a good standard of living, which has always been what the eugenicists have craved.
[1:59:27.160 --> 1:59:32.840]  Absolutely. But now, it's also complicated by the fact that, of course, we have this
[1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:37.560]  worldwide financial crisis. We have the death agony of the dollar as a reserve currency.
[1:59:37.560 --> 1:59:43.480]  We have banking panic going on. We had countrywide. Then we had Northern Rock. We had Bear Stearns.
[1:59:43.480 --> 1:59:47.560]  Now, we've had IndieMac. We basically have banking failures every week.
[1:59:48.360 --> 1:59:54.440]  We've got hyperinflation, which you see in fuel, but also in food and many other areas.
[1:59:54.440 --> 1:59:59.640]  So you're heading towards an extreme world economic breakdown crisis, the end of the
[1:59:59.640 --> 2:00:06.040]  post-1945 era, as Soros himself says. So when Soros says, this is what it is, what does he want?
[2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:13.320]  They've got to increase the looting pressure on the U.S. population to allow the bailout
[2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:19.720]  of JPMorgan Chase, the Soros interests, Goldman Sachs, and so forth. How do you do that, though?
[2:00:19.720 --> 2:00:23.560]  Bush and Cheney would come out and say, well, we're going to tax you for the war on terror,
[2:00:23.560 --> 2:00:27.640]  and that would lead to an explosion in their face. Obama will come and say,
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:32.600]  we're going to save the polar bears. We're going to save the planet. We're going to save the ice
[2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:39.480]  caps. We're going to have carbon tax, cap and trade on carbon. We're going to have a green tax.
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:44.360]  We're going to have a third world solidarity tax. The only problem with this is all the money goes
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:55.800]  to Rockefeller, Soros, and Goldman Sachs. All right, Webster, when we get back, we will break
[2:00:55.800 --> 2:01:02.280]  this all down in detail and finish up the story you're breaking down for us and then get into
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:08.280]  what's happened in Russia. We'll be right back. Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:12.920]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:17.400]  hour there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:01:17.400 --> 2:01:21.480]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:25.800]  of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize
[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:31.400]  the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle

[2:02:07.960 --> 2:02:12.840]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state. This confederation of
[2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:17.640]  evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block.
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:22.680]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:27.000]  the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience. History and
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:31.480]  the Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:36.600]  be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us. This will change the character,
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:41.000]  not civil enforcement. From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:45.880]  Rome, religious intolerance resulted. This union would go directly contrary to the great principles
[2:02:45.880 --> 2:02:51.400]  of our nation. America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda. Protestant America, awake before
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:57.240]  it is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon. For free materials call

[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:38.680]  Webster, let's go through the detailed analysis from your perspective on what happened with the
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:44.280]  Georgian sneak attack last Thursday night into Friday morning on the eve of the Olympic Games on 888.
[2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:51.880]  The Russians moving nuclear weapons in and repulsing the Georgian slash US-British-Israeli
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:57.720]  attack. And what do you think this means geopolitically now? In the words of Lieutenant
[2:04:57.720 --> 2:05:02.840]  Colonel Sam Gardner, Air Force expert on these regions and that area, that region,
[2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:07.560]  and these type of weapons systems. So the Russians undoubtedly brought nukes into the area and that
[2:05:07.560 --> 2:05:15.240]  their stated default position is to nuke with tactical weapons, any US forces that attack
[2:05:15.240 --> 2:05:20.200]  them with precision-guided conventional munitions. And he called this the greatest military escalation
[2:05:20.200 --> 2:05:25.160]  in modern history since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The neocons have been running around on TV,
[2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:29.640]  Crystal and others saying they want war with Russia. The New York Times called it the beginning
[2:05:29.640 --> 2:05:34.760]  of what could be World War III. The Russians reportedly stopped attacking last night, but
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:39.720]  then the Georgians started shooting back at them. That's their tactic. Attack and then when the
[2:05:39.720 --> 2:05:44.040]  Russians attack, scream bloody murder and say that they're being attacked. And I did hear a
[2:05:44.040 --> 2:05:48.040]  lady in a story yesterday talking about, did you hear about the Russians attacking Georgia in the
[2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:54.280]  US? You have a public, completely dumbed down, not knowing which end is up. I mean, how does this
[2:05:54.280 --> 2:06:02.680]  all play together? Well, I have tried to argue for the past eight or nine months. The situation
[2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:08.040]  in Washington, first of all, has fundamentally changed. The neocons are out. They have no power.
[2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:13.240]  We'll see why they're trying to get back on TV now. But the neocons have been broken as a
[2:06:13.240 --> 2:06:19.880]  faction. You've got Libby out, Rumsfeld out, Wolfowitz out, out at the World Bank. Lord Black,
[2:06:19.880 --> 2:06:25.960]  Lord Conrad Black, a top world neocon, is actually now in jail. You've got Lideen under attack by
[2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:32.360]  the Rockefeller Committee for his activities with his old Iran-Contra network. So the
[2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:37.560]  thing that you're facing now, I would not call it neocon anymore. It's not the neocons. It is the
[2:06:37.560 --> 2:06:42.840]  Rockefeller, Brzezinski, trilateral Bilderberg group. Okay. So that's who NATO and Israel are
[2:06:42.840 --> 2:06:47.320]  taking orders from. I'm sure you're aware that- And that is who is running the US government
[2:06:47.320 --> 2:06:51.640]  at this point. I understand that, Webster. Let me bring up this caveat. I mean, it's pretty
[2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:57.640]  darn neocon when you've got the military head of the Georgian military, not even being
[2:06:57.640 --> 2:07:02.440]  Georgian, being an Israeli, and the foreign minister being an Israeli. Go ahead. Yeah. The
[2:07:02.440 --> 2:07:08.120]  point of this now is that the neocons are essentially a group of stragglers and fugitives
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:13.560]  that are tending to attach themselves to the Brzezinski machine, trying to save themselves
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:19.960]  and maintain their positions and their careers in this new era. But notice the emphasis,
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:25.560]  the epicenter of world confrontation, has shifted radically out of the Middle East,
[2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:30.760]  out of the Persian Gulf, and to the borders of Russia, and also China, because the other
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:35.800]  thing, what I was actually looking for to happen on 8808 was some kind of a terrorist stunt
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:39.960]  at the Beijing Olympics. This could still happen, which could also then heat up the
[2:07:39.960 --> 2:07:45.480]  world. And I would urge people to be aware of that, and we can maybe talk about that in a minute.
[2:07:46.200 --> 2:07:52.600]  The kinds of things that you're seeing now are typical classic Brzezinski. Remember,
[2:07:52.600 --> 2:07:57.000]  Brzezinski says, you can't attack these countries yourself. If you want to destroy
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:01.800]  Venezuela, you can't attack them. You use surrogates. Play Colombia. You want to destroy
[2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:07.240]  Somalia? Stay out of there. Let Ethiopia go in. In this case, he's got a little Hitler.
[2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:13.800]  Saka Shvili is a little Hitler. This process of the color revolutions, the so-called
[2:08:14.840 --> 2:08:19.880]  Stop it. And we'll go back to how they financed the takeover there. But did you see the video
[2:08:19.880 --> 2:08:25.720]  of a plane flies overhead, and he starts cowering and crying and then running, and then they cover
[2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:29.960]  him up with armored vest, and he's like screaming like a little girl. I mean, I've never seen a
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:35.320]  leader act like that. An ultimate little coward, and he's wild eyed and then always lying. I mean,
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:40.920]  that these people are nuts. I would compare him in many ways to Obama. A megalomaniac drunk
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:47.480]  with power, indulging in illusions of infantile omnipotence, and really thinking, he probably,
[2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:52.360]  I believe that Brzezinski has played him. In other words, Brzezinski has promised him.
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:56.440]  He told him he'd win, and not that it was really meant to bring Russia in and escalate things.
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:01.000]  And not that it, not that he was, you don't tell your expendable pawns that they are expendable
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.240]  pawns on a kamikaze trip. You don't tell them that. You let them go ahead and think that they're
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:09.080]  coming back. Now, a lot of analysts are saying, and it does seem to be true, that people see
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:14.440]  McCain as a stronger military leader, and that this Georgian-Russian crisis actually
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:19.080]  strengthens McCain's hand. Why would Brzezinski do that? Yeah, I think it may have happened too
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:23.880]  soon. The problem is when you're dealing with somebody as unstable as Sakashvili, he's also
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:30.040]  got to respond to his own internal conditions. One obvious fact, if you want to have an attack
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:34.040]  in that part of the world, you've got to do it during the summer. You can't do it during the
[2:09:34.040 --> 2:09:40.600]  autumn when the rains come. So really, there are competing considerations. Our election is in
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:45.240]  November, but if they're going to attack this year, they more or less got to do it. Now, there's
[2:09:45.240 --> 2:09:51.160]  a lot to be said about that. The principal idea, though, is that Georgia is the aggressor. They
[2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:57.000]  launched a genocidal sneak attack in the middle of the night with massive rocket attacks,
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:04.600]  air bombardment, and heavy artillery to kill the civilians of South Ossetia. And CNN and Fox
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:11.960]  now confirmed showed video of the Georgians attacking South Ossetia and the Gorge over by
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:17.640]  Abkhazia. And then lied and said that was Russians doing it. I mean, this is unprecedented media
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:23.720]  lying. Yeah, it's probably the biggest media hysteria, but you can compare it to 9-11 or the
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:28.920]  Iraq War or Obama. It's the same media that have been telling you Obama is the savior
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:35.560]  or now telling you that Putin and Medvedev are the devils. The Russian response, of course, is
[2:10:35.560 --> 2:10:42.440]  then a powerful counter-stroke, and they've got to destroy the Georgian second echelon. In other
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:47.160]  words, the second attack wave that would have come in there. Yeah, the main forces that were built
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:52.760]  up to come in behind the shockfribs. Now, military infrastructure all over the country.
[2:10:52.760 --> 2:10:57.400]  And they just come in on this. This is largely built up by the U.S. With your tax dollars,
[2:10:57.400 --> 2:11:02.760]  this 10-part little Hitler, Sakashvili. Increase their defense budget by 30-plus times in five
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:05.960]  years, but I want to stop there because I want to go back and then you can go forward. And I want
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:11.240]  to cover every point here and get your take, Webster. Dealing with this, do you think Brzezinski
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:16.120]  and the Anglo-American establishment and the Neocon followers, and I agree with you there,
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:20.680]  they're now like the birdcage line are being removed, new ones being put in as a front
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:24.920]  for the oligarchs, do you think they miscalculated or is this what they expected?
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:31.320]  I think they miscalculated the timing. However, remember, on the McCain side,
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:35.880]  you've also got a tentacle of Brzezinski. And indeed, also in the U.S. government,
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:42.600]  Ian Brzezinski is the other son. He has three kids. Mark Brzezinski, Clinton National Security
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:47.560]  Council works for Obama. Mika Brzezinski, you see here every morning this airhead
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:53.000]  with Scarborough on Morning Joe, MSNBC. But then we have Ian Brzezinski,
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:59.320]  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon for NATO and Eastern Europe. He is
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:05.080]  undoubtedly one of the people who got this thing going, Ian Brzezinski. And of course,
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:10.840]  he's also a top advisor to McCain. So in a certain way, between McCain and Brzezinski
[2:12:11.640 --> 2:12:16.840]  and Obama, you're going to get Brzezinski anyway. The difference, of course, is that with Obama
[2:12:16.840 --> 2:12:22.840]  as the face of imperialism, as we saw in Berlin, Obama basically says, I can get you the European
[2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:27.960]  troops and the European money that with McCain you can't get. That's right. He can sell the suckers
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:33.640]  one more time. Right. And he can get the Europeans to go and die in the apocalyptic war against
[2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:38.280]  Russia, whereas McCain's chances of doing that are inferior. Also, Obama's going to be a better
[2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:43.640]  strike breaker than McCain because he'll do it with left cover. And he can even use his goons,
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:48.280]  which even somebody like Clinton does not have. She does not have an army of goons in the way
[2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:51.560]  that Obama does. But I want to continue with Obama. But let's get back into Russia.
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:59.400]  I mean, this was a very dangerous, reckless move by the oligarchs by the New World Order
[2:12:59.400 --> 2:13:05.160]  to do this. Certainly. Let's just look at the ways this could escalate into World War Three.
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:10.680]  One obvious one is you've got these 2,000 Georgian troops that have gone into Iraq
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:15.000]  at the behest of the U.S. And they wanted to go back to Georgia. Now, I would say to them,
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:20.280]  fine, do it on your own power. But no, we've had C-17 U.S. Air Force transports
[2:13:20.280 --> 2:13:27.800]  ferrying them back. Now, this is a very unfriendly act towards the Russians. Putin is complaining.
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:30.680]  Just started two days ago, bringing them into a hot battle zone.
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:36.280]  Right. And according to NBC News, there were contacts between the State Department and the
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:40.600]  Russian foreign ministry to avoid an incident. And it was the Russians, they said, well,
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:44.600]  we're going to shoot down these planes because those Georgian troops are going to start
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:49.320]  killing Russians and civilians as soon as they get here to the fighting front. That's one
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:55.880]  dimension. The other thing is you have, it's difficult to know how many, at least 125 or
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:14:01.160]  maybe several hundred U.S. advisors are attached to the Georgian defense ministry
[2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:06.760]  to go with all of this hardware that the U.S. has been pouring in to Georgia, which the Russians,
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:12.680]  I hope, have now largely destroyed. But the possibility of some of those U.S. advisors
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:18.680]  getting killed and then a huge media spectacle around that has got to be factored in.
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:25.320]  Another point, the Black Sea, the Russians have put up a naval blockade on the Georgian ports
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:33.640]  in the Black Sea. Suppose the U.S., the British, the French, or the Ukrainian hotheads, also possible,
[2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:39.800]  or Romania, Bulgaria, we don't know. Those are now NATO states, right? Poland and the Balkans
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:45.720]  are basically in NATO. If they try to run the blockade, break the Russian blockade and deliver
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:50.760]  ammunition and go, or even humanitarian, they would say, what really ammunition, I'm sure,
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:56.280]  then that could lead to an international incident. A Lusitanyan type, the Oleg Olpav Tonkin.
[2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:00.280]  It would be, I guess, a Cuban missile crisis in reverse, because the Russians would be there
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.680]  with a picket line, and if you don't stop and you don't submit to a search, they're going to blow
[2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:11.640]  you up. Now, here's the most dangerous. Not only is Sakash Vili and this Georgian regime the product
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:17.480]  of People Power Kuhl, Color Revolution, in this case it's the Roses Revolution, run by Brzezinski,
[2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:22.680]  financed by Soros, National Endowment for Democracy, called it the left CIA. This is
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:26.520]  something you haven't seen that much. Well, you've seen it, but it hasn't been prominent
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:33.320]  internally. If you go to Ukraine, the group in Kiev, Yushenko and Timoshenko, the ice princess,
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:39.240]  right? This blonde, with her braided blonde hair. She's a kleptocrat. She's a NATO agent
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:44.840]  and a kleptocrat. The Ukrainians are supporting Georgia. Now, you've got one of these two Kaczynski
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:52.520]  twins in Poland, and what they've got is the front of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Ukraine.
[2:15:53.320 --> 2:15:58.680]  So we can start just starting similar conflicts. This can only be the start of a larger brushfire
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:07.560]  war. Stay with us. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers,
[2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:13.240]  investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA? That's right. Gold has been available to be
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:18.920]  placed in IRAs since 1986. Finally, recognize the value of real silver as outperformed paper
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:25.080]  investments like stocks, bonds and CDs. Yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:29.960]  institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper. If you'd like
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:36.360]  to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind
[2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:43.800]  by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you
[2:16:43.800 --> 2:16:52.680]  secure your future. Call 800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:17:01.560]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we
[2:17:01.560 --> 2:17:07.560]  knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that
[2:17:07.560 --> 2:17:15.480]  finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the
[2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:22.280]  AT made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum
[2:17:22.280 --> 2:17:27.560]  of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:31.800]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off in

[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:38.760]  like iron, and your breath is hard as kerosene. You weren't your mama's only boy,

[2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:53.080]  sank into your dream.
[2:20:53.080 --> 2:20:54.920]  Well, Mr. Darbley's our guest today.
[2:20:56.680 --> 2:21:02.040]  Aren't your walls a bandit boy? His horse is fast as fire.
[2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:06.760]  Your calls are coming up in about 35 minutes. Talk about any sudden you want with our guests,
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:14.520]  any other issue? Okay, we've gotten into the third when you were saying most dangerous scenario
[2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:22.280]  with these now NATO or sub-NATO states. They all have different ethnic partitions
[2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:31.640]  right along the borders with Russia proper, Mother Russia. Perfect to start these Balkanization,
[2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:37.080]  and divide and conquer conflicts continue. Of the ones that I've mentioned, Poland is a full member
[2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:44.200]  of NATO. This should never have been done. The Polish regime is a collection of anti-Russian
[2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:50.280]  hotheads created in the image of Brzezinski. Brzezinski even says that he considered going back
[2:21:50.280 --> 2:22:00.120]  to Poland in the late 1990s and becoming president of the country and leading the anti-Russian assault
[2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:06.280]  himself. Right now you have these two comical Kaczynski twins. There's a whole new world that
[2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:12.200]  people need to become familiar with. It simply will not do to know about Iraq and Saudi Arabia
[2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:17.320]  and Iran and the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan. The world is now much, much bigger. Brzezinski
[2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:23.320]  plays on an immensely bigger chessboard. Tremendous adventurism. Because look at this,
[2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:28.920]  when you have these clashes, right? The U.S. advisors on the ground in Georgia, U.S. ships
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:35.320]  in the Black Sea, U.S. planes coming in, ferrying in, military supplies, you go immediately to
[2:22:35.320 --> 2:22:41.080]  superpower confrontation. You immediately have intercontinental ballistic missiles ready to go,
[2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:46.280]  H-bombs on them. This may or may not happen in the near future. It's no longer toying with Arabs,
[2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:50.920]  you're genocide-ing and slaughtering who are fighting you with AK-47s. Exactly. You're not
[2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:56.280]  dealing with defenseless states. Iran, of course, is not defenseless in the sense that it can project
[2:22:56.280 --> 2:23:01.320]  power to the Persian Gulf and maybe cut off the world's oil supply. But there's virtually no way
[2:23:01.320 --> 2:23:05.400]  they can strike into the United States. Now, with Russia and indeed with China, this is totally
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:12.920]  different. I would urge people to mobilize on this issue. We cannot have any U.S. money, soldiers,
[2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:20.520]  aid, stop this diplomatic support. Let me point out, in addition to the bellicose nonsense that
[2:23:20.520 --> 2:23:25.880]  you've heard from McCain, he wants to kick the Russians out of the group of aid, and he looks
[2:23:25.880 --> 2:23:32.120]  into Putin's eyes and sees KGB. That's all very witty. I'm sure. Notice that Obama says
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:41.000]  he wants Georgia to become a NATO full member. So Obama, having seen the insanity of his fellow
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:47.880]  Brzezinski puppet, Sakash Vili, the little Hitler, Obama says, yes, let's put the entire weight of
[2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:53.000]  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the U.S., Canada, Turkey, and all these Europeans.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:59.640]  Let's throw that into the scales behind a lunatic like Sakash Vili. This disqualifies Obama. Obama
[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:06.760]  also says the Russians have violated the sovereignty of Georgia and encroached on the sovereignty of
[2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:15.320]  Georgia. No, Senator, that's called hot pursuit. As soon as those Georgians murdered 2,000 civilians
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:21.640]  in the night of the eighth and the ninth, at that point, the countermeasures of the Russians
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:26.600]  are pure self-defense under the UN Charter. That's allowed under the UN Charter, and it
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:31.880]  becomes hot pursuit because you're chasing people that are trying to kill you. They couldn't run
[2:24:31.880 --> 2:24:36.600]  the main armies out and then let them regroup, which they were doing, to refer counter assault
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:41.400]  once they were routed. They had to destroy them. Yes, and remember that Sakash Vili,
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:48.120]  this petty, this tin pot little Hitler, tried the same thing back in 2004, and he was defeated.
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:53.320]  Also remember, he's not democratic at all. There was a large mass movement against him.
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:59.720]  It was basically a color revolution in reverse, this time with real popular support. Sakash
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:05.400]  Vili immediately declared martial law, shut down the TV, kicked out the foreign journalists,
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:11.000]  rounded up the opposition. He tortured and killed them with US support. They even used
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  Georgia reportedly as a black site to take some of the torture victims to. They're full NATO
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:22.840]  puppets. The Russian position, of course, is that South Ossetians are Russian citizens,
[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:27.320]  so you've killed 2,000 Russian citizens and several dozen of their troops. It's comparable
[2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:32.280]  to 9-11. By the way, the number is going up, as you know, Webster. They're now digging a bunch
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.320]  of people out of the rubble, so it's going to be more than 2,000 dead civilians. Webster,
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:41.160]  Tarpley, stay with us. We're going to go to Bright, come back, continue with this, then get
[2:25:41.160 --> 2:25:48.600]  into the social Darwinism, what drives the evil minds. We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:58.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?

[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:04.680]  a new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:10.360]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:16.440]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:20.920]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:29.320]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:33.160]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:36.920]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:39.880]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:45.800]  Yes, they're after easy. Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com,

[2:28:47.560 --> 2:29:03.480]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:22.360]  Bottom line, we have an out-of-control elite who play with the world like it's their little toy.
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:28.600]  My sandwich was good. No, he was caught staging bombings in 1999
[2:29:28.600 --> 2:29:35.160]  so that he could create political support to come into office under a popular war with the
[2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:42.760]  Chechenians backed by, again, the United States. You'll always find the Muslim extremists on a
[2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:48.040]  very short leash to this government. That's why it's so sick that they use them as cover,
[2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:54.680]  as decoys, in the drills for the 9-11 attacks. Webster Tarpley, let me bring this up. How
[2:29:54.680 --> 2:30:01.320]  well, if Brzezinski and the Rand Corporation and the Rockefeller Klam, mimicking what the British
[2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:06.200]  had done in the region at the turn of the last century, creating most of the nations in the
[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:11.160]  Middle East, their modern borders, if they've always been used as a shield to overthrow
[2:30:11.160 --> 2:30:15.320]  democratically elected governments, intellectual governments, even pro-Western governments,
[2:30:15.320 --> 2:30:20.840]  but that won't be puppets, they use Muslim radicals to overthrow countries, then they then fight with
[2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:28.520]  the Muslim radicals they've put in, kind of this endless crisis creation. How do you see
[2:30:28.520 --> 2:30:35.400]  them using the Muslims that they've used against the Serbs in the late 90s and in the 80s against
[2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:41.480]  the Russians? Brzezinski, six months before in 79, having them attack Russian outposts
[2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:46.040]  in the north of Afghanistan, getting a Russian response. How do you see the Muslims,
[2:30:46.040 --> 2:30:54.440]  i.e. mainly the Wahhabist, the Muslim majority, the 80% Sunni, how do you see them being used
[2:30:54.440 --> 2:30:58.120]  on the chessboard? Who are they or are they a Rook or are they just a pawn?
[2:30:59.080 --> 2:31:06.760]  Brzezinski is the father of modern Islamic fundamentalism. He argued, pardon me, in the
[2:31:06.760 --> 2:31:14.280]  Carter administration that Muslim fundamentalism was the great bulwark against Soviet
[2:31:14.280 --> 2:31:21.800]  communism. He installed Khomeini. He created Khomeini. Khomeini was a well-known long-term British
[2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:26.520]  agent, had been used against the Shah during the Shah. You know what, let's spend some time on that.
[2:31:26.520 --> 2:31:30.840]  I'm going to sit back. Let's spend some time on that because I've researched that for the
[2:31:30.840 --> 2:31:36.360]  solicitors that have people believing that. That is true. Let's go back to 53. Let's explain the
[2:31:36.360 --> 2:31:41.800]  run-up to 79 in the Islamic Revolution and in the Islamic State being shut up.
[2:31:41.800 --> 2:31:50.280]  Well, Mazadek would belong along with General Qasem of Iraq and Nasser of Egypt and any number
[2:31:50.280 --> 2:31:57.640]  of others to the wave of progressive nationalistic military types in the Arab world. It would have
[2:31:57.640 --> 2:32:03.240]  been the interest of the United States to cooperate with them for the modernization of the region
[2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:08.360]  and the ending of colonialism and imperialism. This was even in the Eisenhower administration,
[2:32:08.360 --> 2:32:13.320]  the Suez policy of 1956, turning against the British, the French, and the Israelis
[2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:19.480]  in favor of the Arabs. That's what got the U.S. into the Middle East in any positive way
[2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:27.160]  in the first place. But the overthrow of Mazadek is a joint operation of the British with
[2:32:27.160 --> 2:32:32.680]  Alan Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, and the pro-Wall Street CIA forces.
[2:32:32.680 --> 2:32:38.840]  And the father of Norman Schwarzkopf. Yes, right, that too. And here's the thing,
[2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:44.680]  that the Shah, the problem of the Shah is this. He had some positive features in the 1960s.
[2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:49.000]  Let me mention this white revolution. The Mullahs of Iran are an expression of the
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:54.280]  latter funders, the huge landowners. They're kind of a feudal class. They're a little bit like this
[2:32:54.280 --> 2:32:59.000]  feudal monster. We have the Dalai Lama running around today that the Hollywood people think
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:04.840]  is spiritual. The Shah had this thing called the White Revolution, which was to break up
[2:33:04.840 --> 2:33:10.360]  the huge latter fundia and actually have a land reform and to try to actually advance
[2:33:10.360 --> 2:33:16.760]  the country. Now, this was his last attempt in that regard. But Khomeini was deployed as a British
[2:33:16.760 --> 2:33:22.920]  agent. The idea in Iran was scratch a mullah and you'll find a British agent. That's basically
[2:33:22.920 --> 2:33:30.120]  correct. The Khomeini Revolution was a joint U.S.-British project, but the BBC Persian language
[2:33:30.120 --> 2:33:35.560]  service, the Farsi service, was the leading edge of this entire thing. Now remember, the Shah,
[2:33:36.120 --> 2:33:41.880]  by now politically, is a monster. He's a reactionary. He's governing with the secret
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:47.640]  police. However, in terms of his economic stuff, he's got deals with the Soviets, deals with the
[2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:55.880]  Italians. He's going outside the realm of U.S. domination and he's got reactors either started
[2:33:55.880 --> 2:34:02.440]  or about to start. He's got steel mills. He's got about 50 billion dollars of tremendous
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:06.680]  development. He made the mistake Serbia made. He was becoming independent. He was becoming
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:13.880]  independent and he was providing a way to see a country advance from medieval backwardness
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:20.280]  into the modern age with nuclear energy, steel mills, petrochemical, new airport, new subway
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:25.480]  system for Tehran, the port of Bandar Abbas. My entree into this was, I knew that this guy,
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:31.560]  Loris Corby of Italy, one of the great civil engineering companies of the world,
[2:34:31.560 --> 2:34:37.480]  who was building this new city of Bandar Abbas. Now, Bandar Khomeini. When Khomeini came in,
[2:34:37.480 --> 2:34:43.160]  he shut down all of this. The Iranians would have long since been in the nuclear age. They would
[2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:48.840]  have had 10 or 20 peaceful nuclear reactors going, but it was Khomeini who stopped that.
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:54.520]  So, Brzezinski basically says, look, we've got to stop economic development in the third world.
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:58.600]  The way we do it was with people like Paul Pot, trained in Paris.
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:02.760]  Yeah, for those that don't know, let's flush that out now some. He brags in two of his books
[2:35:02.760 --> 2:35:06.360]  that they helped Paul Pot and helped him kill two million people. He should be immediately
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:10.920]  arrested. This isn't us saying this. He writes this and says that, you know, we let him kill
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:14.680]  two million people and supported him and I'm proud of what I did. I can pull the quote up,
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:18.680]  but that's basically what he said. I mean, this is just the amazing type of activity.
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:25.080]  If you don't want to cover Paul Pot briefly, then I want to go back to 1979, 1980, then this stage
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:32.840]  deal with the, quote, Republicans doing a deal to have him grab hostages, then stage an event.
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:38.360]  But you have Brzezinski in the White House. Why would he then double back and betray
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:41.800]  Carter if you're saying he's the mastermind? I know he's a fellow traveler and very powerful.
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:49.640]  But then, you know, Bern, the Carter administration, which he ran and sat in
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:57.240]  via the Reagan administration with the Muslim Islamic Revolution over there for the weapons.
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:02.440]  Now, remember, Brzezinski believes that Islamic fundamentalism is the number one
[2:36:02.440 --> 2:36:08.280]  bulwark against Soviet communism. So he foments that in Iran. That's where the whole thing begins,
[2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:13.400]  really. And then he sends in these teams into Afghanistan, as you said, to get the Soviets
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:19.800]  in there and begin to bring them down. Brzezinski fundamentally believes that he can use the
[2:36:19.800 --> 2:36:25.880]  Khomeini regime against the Soviets. This is the problem you have when you have a policy of
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:31.320]  what might be called appeasement, but really of turning these other countries into kamikaze
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:36.600]  puppets, suicidal pawns, expendable assets against your bigger enemy. That's the end
[2:36:36.600 --> 2:36:42.280]  of the Brzezinski method. Right. You point them at the Russians and let them go.
[2:36:42.280 --> 2:36:48.040]  This cannot be avowed in public. Now, Brzezinski wanted to arm Khomeini,
[2:36:48.040 --> 2:36:54.920]  but he couldn't do it in public. And he needed a cover story. So he encouraged, in my view,
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:37:00.280]  encouraged the taking of the hostages as a piece of political theater that would allow him
[2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:06.040]  to continue U.S. military deliveries to Iran. And that's what is called Iran Contra,
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:11.640]  started under Carter. And the U.S. military deliveries to Iran never stopped. There's a
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:18.120]  guy called Stanley Pottinger, who's involved, and the Brzezinski National Security Council,
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:23.240]  where they had Iranian representatives. The so-called captain, say, today, was operating
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:25.800]  under the U.S. Navy. The power never changes. They just remove a figure.
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:31.640]  Yes, but again, it's part of this. The question is that you're trying to subvert those five
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:36.600]  critical republics in Central Asia. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:44.360]  and Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, like the five big Soviet Central Asian republics.
[2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:51.320]  That's your target. Now, Brzezinski, therefore, has a public policy, and then he has the real
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:58.040]  policy. If you think about the accusation of appeasement against Obama, it's accurate,
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:03.480]  as long as you know what appeasement is. You can imagine Obama acting as a puppet for
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:09.400]  Brzezinski talking to the Iranians. He would say, your real enemy is the Russians, not us.
[2:38:10.280 --> 2:38:16.840]  You've got to oppose the Russians in the Caspian Sea. You need a navy in the Caspian Sea. We'll
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:22.280]  give you a navy in the Caspian Sea, so you can stop those Russians from taking your oil.
[2:38:22.280 --> 2:38:28.280]  You want nuclear weapons? We'll give them to you. We have special nukes. They only go to Moscow.
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:32.280]  You want some of those? We'll give you some right away. There is no objection
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:35.480]  by Brzezinski to Iran as a nuclear power, but this cannot be done.
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:41.320]  How did Pakistan's armament and by the U.S. and England, how does that play into this larger
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:46.440]  chessboard? I don't know if that's quite so connected. I think the U.S., obviously,
[2:38:46.440 --> 2:38:51.800]  what you say is true. That's how, you know, AQ Khan was working for the U.S. all along.
[2:38:51.800 --> 2:38:56.840]  But again, the Iranian one is the really big one because Pakistan has to be destroyed
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:39:02.360]  because the geopolitical instinct is pro-Chinese. Iran can be used as a puppet because the
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:08.040]  geopolitical instinct, as I've argued, is anti-Russian. Brzezinski would say to them,
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:12.920]  look, didn't I arm you under Iran contra? Didn't I give you everything you needed?
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:19.000]  Yes. Well then, let me do it again for you now. I can deliver everything you need under the table,
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:24.600]  but let's get you going against those nasty Russians. Aqba Dinajad will be out by next year.
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:32.040]  There's a new power constellation. This is what Obama would talk about. The neocons say,
[2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:38.280]  bomb Iran. Brzezinski, with Obama, says, no. Talk to Iran, but destroy Pakistan. Remember,
[2:39:38.280 --> 2:39:43.640]  Obama is the same more subtle system that we see growing out of Carter and then being implemented
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:50.280]  by the Reagan, really the Bush White House, the Bush 41-42 White House.
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:56.040]  Because what we're dealing with is with Iraq. I mean, I want to get your analysis on this.
[2:39:56.040 --> 2:40:00.120]  Same thing. They arm Iraq, tens of billions of dollars, have them attack Iran,
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:06.200]  then they tear each other up, and then you have the whole region to send down into another level.
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:10.840]  Yeah, I have a whole chapter on the Carter administration, about a 40-page summary.
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:16.920]  People can't remember what a horror, how horrendous it was under the Carter-Brzezinski
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:20.920]  Volcker regime. It was one of the qualitative turning points in American history.
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:26.120]  Concerning what you've just mentioned, the Iraq-Iran War, now here's the problem.
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:33.000]  Brzezinski installs Khomeini. The Shah is driven out by Carter and Brzezinski. They stab him in
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:38.200]  the back. At that point, there's a military government or Bakhtiar, a reasonable kind of
[2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:41.160]  a... The Shah dies of a 24-hour cancer.
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:47.000]  They give government, and then they essentially then, the Khomeini comes in, and when Khomeini
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:52.680]  shuts down all the development projects because they're not Islamic in his view,
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:57.640]  the country begins to fall apart. Now, they realize that Khomeini is going to be out within six months.
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:03.160]  The only way to stabilize Khomeini is to go to Saddam Hussein and say, if you attack,
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:09.400]  you'll have an easy victory. So, you play Saddam Hussein against Iran. This leads to a war that
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:13.000]  goes on for the best part of the decade. Knowing that that will create nationalism and will actually
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:17.720]  strengthen the Islamic Revolution. You will keep Khomeini in power. Now, all of this on
[2:41:17.720 --> 2:41:21.960]  Brzezinski's watch. So, you've got the Soviet-Afghan War unleashed by Brzezinski.
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:26.440]  But that's really what the neocons have been doing. Saber rattling has made Iran more hardline,
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:29.320]  and made the government more popular at a point where they were about to topple.
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:36.200]  Well, I would say there was a serious last-ditch attempt by Cheney to bomb Iran,
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:41.400]  most likely with nuclear weapons, last August, September. That was the Rogue B-52.
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:45.000]  He tried as hard as he could, and he came within a hand's breadth.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:49.720]  But we just learned that they're trying to paint up the PT boats and have a conflict over there.
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:55.640]  I don't see an attack on Iran. I would rule it out. The U.S. and the British do not want it,
[2:41:55.640 --> 2:41:59.560]  and the Israelis seem to have bought into the new strategy. In other words,
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:05.480]  their prominence in the Georgian picture indicates to me that the Israelis have seen
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:09.560]  that there will be no attack on Iran. There is, however,
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:13.480]  an attack on Pakistan going on right now. We've got the other side of it.
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:21.800]  The Turkmenistan Islamic Party is a puppet group of Patsy's in Chinese Turkestan,
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:26.600]  Xinjiang province, right, the northwest of China, who have now suddenly started rattling sabers
[2:42:26.600 --> 2:42:32.200]  and delivering their videos to the CIA front intel center. All right, and they are up. They
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:37.960]  run probably through the Pakistani ISI, or maybe directly by Chosudovsky has an interesting article
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:44.840]  about this. But the idea is that terrorism in China is also being stoked with Tibetans,
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:50.520]  with these Turkmen, or basically, they're all Turks. They're all Muslim Turks
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:56.760]  between the Caspian Sea and Mongolia, Tibet. It's a Turkish area largely. Tajikistan,
[2:42:56.760 --> 2:43:01.080]  I guess is the exception. So they're a whole bunch of Muslim Turks, and they can be used now,
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:05.800]  along with the Tibetans, and along with the democracy freaks, the Amnesty International
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:13.160]  Human Rights Watch crew, to try to destabilize the government of China. But now, let's also think,
[2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:18.760]  what's the new face of false flag terrorism? Let me suggest, I was in Amsterdam, Holland,
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:23.720]  a couple of weeks ago, the Docs on the Doc series, and I showed a bunch of pictures.
[2:43:23.720 --> 2:43:29.320]  Let's see what the new face of terrorism is. Cho at Virginia Tech, you look at him,
[2:43:29.320 --> 2:43:35.960]  well, he's Korean, but he might be Chinese. So he's a crazy oriental Korean. He's not a
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:40.680]  Manchurian candidate. And now in the middle of the Olympics, you have a Chinese guy killing two
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:46.760]  people and it's hyped like aliens have landed. But let's do, Cho is one. Kazmirchak,
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:53.240]  Northern Illinois University, he's a left-wing student with social justice concerns. He doesn't
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:57.000]  like the way the criminal justice... The other Chinese guy that ran around a few years ago,
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:02.440]  shooting the 14 dare hunters. And then we, I would then include the Unabomber. This is not
[2:44:02.440 --> 2:44:08.040]  quite as recent, but the idea of ecological terrorism. If you're a polluter, if your carbon
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:14.440]  footprint is too big, maybe the new Unabomber or Earth First or somebody like this will come and
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:21.480]  visit you. Then we have the classic ones done by the British against Russia to signal the coming
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:28.680]  of the new policy, which is Lytvinyanka, a Russian from the KGB with nuclear terrorism.
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:34.520]  Don't think about the relations. Just think about the sort of pictorial memes of the myth.
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:39.880]  Lytvinyanka is one. Politkovskaya, now she's a Russian journalist who's a assassinated and
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:45.000]  immediately blamed Putin. All indications are that this comes from the Berezovsky stable,
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:49.480]  Boris Berezovsky, Russian oligarch, now working for British intelligence.
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:54.440]  Let's see what else we can think of. Ilya Akhmadov. This is, of course, the Chechen
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:45:01.080]  ambassador here. He's the ambassador of the main Chechen terrorist organization,
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:07.720]  the one with Basayev and Moskadov, run by the CIA. I would say they're the people who blew up
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:13.720]  those buildings in Moscow in 1999. They're the ones who did the theater, the school in Beslan,
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:19.560]  and also the hospital in southern Russia in 1995. The Chechens have now claimed,
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:27.320]  probably, 1,000 to 1,500 dead. The Russians, if you add up their Butcher's bill,
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:33.880]  the Russians have suffered from international terrorism, at least as much as the U.S. in 911.
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:40.360]  But let's look at Akhmadov, right? He's here because Big New Brzezinski lobbied to get him
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:45.880]  asylum. He's now being paid with your money, State Department stipend, under the Reagan-Fasell
[2:45:45.880 --> 2:45:51.560]  program. He's living in a nice house here in Woodley Park by the zoo. He has an office at
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:57.080]  the National Endowment for Democracy. He gets a secretary, a travel budget, a public relations
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:01.240]  budget, all courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. Now, the Russians have repeatedly said,
[2:46:01.240 --> 2:46:05.800]  this is a terrorist. You've got an extra item. We want to put him on trial. The U.S. says,
[2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:10.840]  no, he's a Democratic force. As long as he's anti-Putin, it means that he's Democratic.
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:17.480]  When you had that festival on school in September of 2004, the Russian press was full of this attack
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:23.800]  was planned in London and Washington. I believe it's actually quite correct. So if you add up
[2:46:23.800 --> 2:46:32.120]  these faces, right? Cho, Kazmirchak, Litvinenko in particular, the Unabomber, and then somebody
[2:46:32.120 --> 2:46:38.280]  like Ilya Sakhmadov, I think that's a composite of memes from which you can see the probably
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:43.320]  various kinds of false flag terrorism that are now likely to be unleashed. And again,
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:49.800]  it's not just Chechens, right? It could be the FARC. But we saw this tremendous media circus
[2:46:49.800 --> 2:46:55.640]  around this woman, Betankur. Stay there, stay there. Keep out of reach of children under six
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:47:00.040]  years of age. If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance,
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:04.680]  or contact a poison control center immediately. Why would you or your family use a product with
[2:47:04.680 --> 2:47:08.840]  this warning? If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy,

[2:47:54.040 --> 2:48:01.320]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:04.120]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:08.440]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you,
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:11.160]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:25.320]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:29.960]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:36.600]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:39.320]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:44.840]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:50.920]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:53.960]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:48:53.960 --> 2:48:57.320]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[2:48:57.320 --> 2:49:01.080]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:05.160]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[2:49:05.160 --> 2:49:09.880]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:12.680]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:18.280]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:22.920]  Sprayyourplate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras,

[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:39.720]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time,
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:47.960]  and then we are back, right here on the network, 9 to 1 on the Genesis feeds,
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:53.240]  24 hours a day at infoawards.com. Do the four-hour show them for 20 hours,
[2:50:53.240 --> 2:50:57.000]  it re-hears back-to-back, so you missed Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and his analysis
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:01.960]  of what happened in Russia, very similar to Tar Police. That'll be re-airing when this show ends
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:07.000]  in about one hour and four minutes from now. We're going to take your calls,
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:13.560]  wide open phones, in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231. Any subject you want to discuss,
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:22.360]  Webster has agreed to ride shotgun with us. We always enjoy having him on with us. 1-800-259-9231.
[2:51:22.360 --> 2:51:27.000]  Interesting story I'll cover later in the next hour. Beijing Olympics 2008 opening ceremony,
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:33.560]  giant firework footprints, faked, and that's the kind of stuff China and Russia and every
[2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:38.760]  government. All governments are evil and wicked and corrupt, but who is the dominant global force?
[2:51:38.760 --> 2:51:42.760]  Well, that is, as Tarpley calls it, the Anglo-American Empire. It doesn't matter,
[2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:46.520]  they're all corrupt, they're all bad, we're just cold-bloodily analyzing
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:50.200]  how they're fighting with each other and what they're doing. Remember, the state is the enemy
[2:51:50.200 --> 2:51:54.680]  of the people bottom line throughout history. The problem is there's always other states
[2:51:54.680 --> 2:52:00.040]  trying to come in and take over your state, so it's a very, very serious equilibrium that has
[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:05.720]  to be held of the size of the state. But again, we'll continue with Tarpley here in just a moment.
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:13.080]  Don't forget, I am a documentary filmmaker. I have made 19 films, the latest is Truth Rising.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:17.080]  And it's got Zbigniew Brzezinski being confronted in it by the young Luke Radowski and him saying,
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:23.320]  sit down and shut up. And it's got everybody else from Geraldo Rivera to Barack Obama to Hillary
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:27.880]  Clinton to John McCain being confronted. And then it's got Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura,
[2:52:28.600 --> 2:52:35.240]  the good guys in it. It's got Democracy Now's, Amy Goodman talking about bombs in the building.
[2:52:35.240 --> 2:52:40.440]  It's got George Carlin right before he died talking about an inside job. On 9-11, it's got
[2:52:40.440 --> 2:52:44.680]  the police trying to plant bombs on 9-11 activists. I mean, I really can't describe how
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:48.760]  powerful. But this is probably the best view of any film I've made, the most entertaining.
[2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:52.840]  I mean, you talk about short attention span theater, it just moves from issue to issue,
[2:52:53.400 --> 2:52:56.840]  really grabbing people in a way, in a different way than other films.
[2:52:56.840 --> 2:53:02.120]  Truth Rising available at infowars.com on DVD or watch it right now on Super High Quality

[2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:19.480]  at prisonplanet.tv. Going back to Webster Tarpley, when we come back in the next segment,
[2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:25.480]  we will take your calls for the balance of the hour. Webster, finishing up with what you
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:30.120]  expect to see in this election. I know you think that the greater of two evils is Barack Obama.
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:34.120]  I myself see it as a huge distraction, but I understand you're saying his star appeal,
[2:56:34.120 --> 2:56:39.560]  and I agree, will bring people into the fold to support the corporate fascism and give them the
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:45.960]  grassroots cover they need. So I agree with you, he's the most dangerous candidate. I just
[2:56:45.960 --> 2:56:51.400]  psychologically have divorced myself so much from the two parties and fully understanding
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:55.960]  their puppets that I can't even really see Obama, I guess as many other people see him,
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:56:59.320]  but in closing in the three and a half minutes we have left in this opening segment,
[2:56:59.320 --> 2:57:05.800]  other key points you'd like to make? Well, I would say first of all, if you get Obama with
[2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:11.160]  the Democratic Congress, you will have the full fury of the fascist corporate state
[2:57:11.160 --> 2:57:17.160]  in terms of that economic austerity, killer austerity, genocidal austerity that I talked about.
[2:57:17.160 --> 2:57:23.480]  Under Green, polar bear, snail daughter, auspices, third world solidarity,
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:29.000]  and possibly even this other question of reparations to this or that ethnic group,
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:36.280]  which would also be a very explosive recipe. If you get McCain, I would say you get a tired old
[2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:41.560]  lame duck who is going to be a lame duck from the first moment he gets there. He'll be quacking in
[2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:48.360]  his inaugural address, and he will be faced by a very hostile Democratic Congress giving us gridlock.
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:54.360]  This is the best outcome we could get under that scenario would be the gridlock. So in this sense,
[2:57:54.360 --> 2:57:59.800]  McCain is actually a lesser evil than Obama. The Democrats try to scare you with McCain.
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:04.440]  They tell you that he's going to put in these fascist judges. Well, the Democrats can filibuster
[2:58:04.440 --> 2:58:08.680]  those judges if they want to. So don't try to scare us with that. With Mrs. Clinton,
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:14.840]  I think you get a much more open-ended project. This is somebody who responds to public opinion
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:20.600]  through triangulation, but she does respond, and her history during the primaries has been to move
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:26.600]  more and more towards New Deal positions, at least verbally, and that's what we've got to work with
[2:58:27.320 --> 2:58:34.280]  at this point. And this would also allow a solution that would not be McCain and not be
[2:58:34.280 --> 2:58:39.320]  Obama. That's the merit of Mrs. Clinton is that she's not McCain and she's not Obama. And I think
[2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:45.080]  there is going to be a movement to try to get her nominated and perhaps even to change the outcome
[2:58:45.640 --> 2:58:50.520]  of the convention. But I think that the principle idea is you've got to build a movement.
[2:58:51.320 --> 2:58:58.200]  The way you build a movement is figure out what the financiers want most and oppose them.
[2:58:58.200 --> 2:59:02.200]  I would not say that the state is always the enemy. My analysis of history is different.
[2:59:02.200 --> 2:59:10.200]  I would say financier oligarchs, feudal aristocrats in the more distant past, financiers, finance
[2:59:10.200 --> 2:59:16.840]  oligarchs, bankers are the enemy. And if you look at the origin of the modern state under somebody
[2:59:16.840 --> 2:59:24.040]  like Gian Galliazzo Visconti in Milan in the early about 1400, if you look then at Louis the 11th
[2:59:24.600 --> 2:59:31.000]  of France in the 1470s, 1480s, and Henry VII of England, the Earl of Richmond, the guy who got rid
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:37.960]  of Richard III, what you see there is an alliance of the king, that is the state, with the bourgeoisie,
[2:59:37.960 --> 2:59:43.480]  the cities, and the peasantry against what? Against feudal oligarchs who are already
[2:59:43.480 --> 2:59:49.080]  transforming themselves into banking oligarchs and financiers. Well, Webster, my point is,
[2:59:49.080 --> 2:59:54.440]  is that big states are the most abusive throughout history. It breeds corruption. The corrupt come
[2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:59.880]  in to suck out of it. And so I'm, and then look at what the oligarchs always want. They always
[2:59:59.880 --> 3:00:06.360]  want a big state as their tool to control populations, destroy middle classes, wage war on the bourgeoisie
[3:00:06.360 --> 3:00:12.360]  using the commie terms. We'll be right back with Webster Tarpoli and your phone calls right here
[3:00:12.360 --> 3:00:16.840]  on the one the only Genesis Communications Radio Network. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:28.120]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[3:00:28.120 --> 3:00:35.720]  to PCI teach and be able to work with all personnel all over the place. They were all
[3:00:35.720 --> 3:00:43.160]  being built up and what the Syrians grew up in power and united, they build up and want
[3:00:43.160 --> 3:00:52.920]  to be focused in the region. So when we hit the bay, we were working in each side together
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:01:00.540]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds Hero,
[3:01:00.540 --> 3:01:02.040]  and we knew what to do.
[3:01:02.040 --> 3:01:03.920]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:09.220]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:01:09.220 --> 3:01:10.920]  to tell their story.
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:19.820]  Whitman, EPA director on the AG, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:01:19.820 --> 3:01:24.600]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:26.880]  take action against their global masters.
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:30.040]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:35.840]  He takes his hand off, and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:01:35.840 --> 3:01:38.840]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:45.200]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:47.840]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:51.520]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:54.360]  and bring in martial law.
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:59.000]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:03.760]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:04.760]  Hi, folks.
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:05.760]  Alex Jones here.

[3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:58.600]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:02.600]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:03.600]  the water?
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:07.480]  Yes, because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into
[3:03:07.480 --> 3:03:08.480]  the skin.
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:13.160]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is the best one

[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:30.120]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  With Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:45.760]  Okay, we've got Webster Tarpley with us for the rest of the hour, an in-depth interview
[3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:57.760]  today with him on the economy, the election, almost happened in Russia in future actions.
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:03.800]  Before we go any further, Webster, is there anything else you want to add concerning
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:07.760]  the geopolitical climate we're in right now before we go to calls?
[3:04:07.760 --> 3:04:08.760]  Certainly.
[3:04:08.760 --> 3:04:12.760]  I think right now you've got to also look at the situation in Europe, because one of
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:17.120]  Brzezinski's main goals, of course, is to play Europe against Russia, too.
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:21.400]  Normally Europe would gravitate towards Russia right now because of the oil, the natural
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:27.560]  gas, the epicenter of the current world economic breakdown crisis, the Bush economic depression
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:30.000]  is, of course, London and New York.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:34.040]  They've been hit hardest, and other people have been hit hard because they've gotten
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:36.200]  into bed with London and New York.
[3:04:36.200 --> 3:04:40.800]  There's a whole school of opinion in France, Germany, Italy, on the continent that it's
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:47.480]  time now to orient towards the Russians, east-west trade, oil for technology, mutually beneficial
[3:04:47.480 --> 3:04:48.480]  economic development.
[3:04:48.480 --> 3:04:50.840]  So Brzezinski's got to destroy that.
[3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:57.080]  And what he wants to use is that cordon sanitaire, or that, you know, that unsanitary cordon
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:02.960]  of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Ukraine to begin cutting off the natural gas.
[3:05:02.960 --> 3:05:07.320]  The Russians, of course, are going around that by building a pipeline down the middle
[3:05:07.320 --> 3:05:12.440]  of the Baltic so that they can deliver guaranteed energy without the Ukrainians and the Poles
[3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:16.800]  skimming or cutting it off or provoking or the rest of this stuff.
[3:05:16.800 --> 3:05:22.160]  Remember, we have to thank, ironically enough, in this terrible situation, we have to thank
[3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:29.520]  Sarkozy of all people and Merkel for blocking the attempt by Brzezinski to bring Georgia
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:35.880]  and Ukraine into NATO as members, or at least get that going, at the last NATO meeting back
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:36.880]  in April.
[3:05:36.880 --> 3:05:39.720]  Remember, Obama wants Georgia in NATO.
[3:05:39.720 --> 3:05:41.760]  The Washington Post wants them in there.
[3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:48.640]  We've got to say no, no NATO membership for this bandit, thug, kleptocrat regime.
[3:05:48.640 --> 3:05:55.080]  The other thing is, the Italian position right now, the Italian government is Berlusconi.
[3:05:55.080 --> 3:05:58.120]  This just shows you what kind of a situation we're in.
[3:05:58.120 --> 3:06:04.720]  Berlusconi, of course, is this dirty character that everybody knows, but he's also a friend
[3:06:04.720 --> 3:06:10.240]  of the Russians, and the Italians have gone very, very far in this east-west trade, oil
[3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:15.840]  for technology kind of stuff, and they've got a history of building huge automobile plants
[3:06:15.840 --> 3:06:21.480]  right, the Togliatti Fiat plant that built all those ladders that are still running.
[3:06:21.480 --> 3:06:26.640]  The Italians are saying, the foreign minister Frattini is saying, we cannot transform the
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:33.160]  European Union into an anti-Russian bloc, so Georgia, get lost, stay out there.
[3:06:33.160 --> 3:06:38.200]  I've also been in touch with my friend Giulietto Chiesa, a member of the European Parliament
[3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:39.200]  in Brussels.
[3:06:39.200 --> 3:06:43.600]  You remember, he's the one who did the zero documentary.
[3:06:43.600 --> 3:06:46.880]  I was in Milan last November.
[3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:53.280]  We had 500 people in the auditorium with Dario Faul, Nobel Prize for Literature and probably
[3:06:53.280 --> 3:06:55.960]  the most red playwright in the world today.
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:07:02.400]  There's an anthology also called Zero, with essays by all sorts of people among them.
[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:03.400]  Yours truly.
[3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:10.320]  So Giulietto Chiesa is leading a publicity effort in Europe to try to show people that
[3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:14.560]  Georgia is this bunch of pawns of Brzezinski.
[3:07:14.560 --> 3:07:21.080]  So there's also a lot of work to be done vis-à-vis the Europeans, trying to get them to break
[3:07:21.080 --> 3:07:22.080]  away.
[3:07:22.080 --> 3:07:27.600]  In other words, don't become a lemming for Obama like those poor Germans at the victory
[3:07:27.600 --> 3:07:31.680]  column there, the Zigezweiler in the middle of Berlin.
[3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:34.840]  Don't go with that, but rather dump Obama.
[3:07:34.840 --> 3:07:40.280]  I'm very glad to say my book, Obama the Postmodern Coup, is coming out in a German
[3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:48.520]  edition in the Kopp-Fellach, that is K-O-P-P, which will be hitting the newsstands fairly
[3:07:48.520 --> 3:07:52.440]  soon in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair, among other things.
[3:07:52.440 --> 3:07:55.360]  I'm also coming out in Japan because there's another place.
[3:07:55.360 --> 3:08:01.160]  The Japanese have said very clearly, it was a successful summit of Prime Minister Fukuda
[3:08:01.160 --> 3:08:02.880]  with President Hu of China.
[3:08:02.880 --> 3:08:07.680]  The Japanese defense minister said, the biggest threat to us is chaos in China.
[3:08:07.680 --> 3:08:12.040]  This is a way of saying, dear Zbigniew, we will not be a staging area for your attacks
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:13.040]  on China.
[3:08:13.040 --> 3:08:19.480]  In Taiwan, the KMT, the Kuomintang Party, has made a comeback kicking out the U.S. puppets,
[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:25.400]  the DPP Green Party or Democratic Progressive Party, get rid of them, put in people who
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:30.000]  are reasonable, who realize that their future is a rapprochement with China and mutually
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  beneficial trade.
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  Okay.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:35.560]  I'll have to stop you there because I want to give some time to callers.
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:39.720]  I have to say, everything you're saying is accurate about what's happening in the world.
[3:08:39.720 --> 3:08:42.840]  I don't disagree with about 95% of what you're saying.
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:47.160]  The problem is, there's more to all of this.
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:55.680]  It is a fact that the CIA, back to the Communist against the Japanese in China, it is a fact
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:09:00.400]  now declassified that the CIA and David Rockefeller's written editorials in the New York Times
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:06.120]  were saying this, wanted the Communist Chinese to come to power so that they could use them
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:08.000]  in China.
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:13.400]  It is a fact that Armin Hammer and the Rockefellers and the Big Foundation monies pump billions
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:21.720]  into Russia from its founding overthrowing the Tsars, poor British intelligence, in 1917
[3:09:21.720 --> 3:09:24.840]  right through into the 80s.
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:28.960]  And you're right, they attack with both sides and they're always trying to gobble up republics.
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:33.640]  I mean, you know, they basically attack from all angles, from within, from without, always
[3:09:33.640 --> 3:09:38.640]  creating a neo-mercantile system which leaves all nation states weak and vulnerable and
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:43.200]  basically starving and infighting with regional and religious conflicts.
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:47.000]  I just want to point out that we're not saying China's good or Russia's good or anybody's
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:49.200]  good here.
[3:09:49.200 --> 3:09:53.400]  You can disagree if you want, it's that you have this evil global corporate management
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:09:59.920]  system that was developed out of London, the city of London.
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:05.600]  And I just don't want to oversimplify this where America and England and Israel are the
[3:10:05.600 --> 3:10:08.680]  bad guys and everybody else are the good guys.
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:12.280]  All these countries are engaging in oppression and in corruption.
[3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:17.600]  That's the nature of society and I'm just trying to get people to see the bigger picture
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:21.280]  of how these big tectonic forces are colliding into each other.
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:26.040]  Well, let's look at the heart of the world problem right now is this mass of derivatives,
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:28.880]  this cancerous mass of kited derivatives.
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:33.440]  And that was a financial weapons system by the central banks while the dollar was still
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:37.120]  the world reserve currency, they made a mad dash to buy up all the real infrastructure
[3:10:37.120 --> 3:10:41.600]  of the world, buy up the defense contractors media of the world to set up their global
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:48.800]  corporate empire off of the yolk, you know, like an egg off of the substance that was
[3:10:48.800 --> 3:10:53.360]  the United States now they want to leave us holding the financial bag for that collapse
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:57.800]  while they've moved in to safe havens, then bring in a third world police state here and
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:11:04.520]  use the United States as a military enclave to produce modern Hessian soldiers for the
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:12.000]  new global corporate state that has shocked any connection to any original nation state.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.960]  But remember now the if you if we use let's use my estimate of one quadrillion, it's probably
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:21.400]  one point five quadrillion or maybe a lot more, but it's six thousand trillion that
[3:11:21.400 --> 3:11:22.400]  we know of.
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:27.520]  Well, yes, but I'm saying what I'm saying one, well, you want to say two quadrillion
[3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:31.040]  fine two quadrillion is ballpark perfectly good.
[3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:32.040]  Where is that centered?
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:35.800]  Well, about a quarter of that is just JP Morgan Chase.
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:40.880]  And when you add up the rest of the US, you'll get up to well over half, you'll get up to
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:45.080]  probably two thirds of the derivatives and the rest are in London.
[3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:51.320]  So there you see where the center of this cancer is to say that Russia is the same as
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:52.320]  this.
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:56.160]  No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm saying there just not as powerful absolutely the Anglo-American
[3:11:56.160 --> 3:11:59.920]  establishment flooded the world with this liquidity to get everybody in debt and get
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:00.920]  real assets.
[3:12:00.920 --> 3:12:02.480]  Now they're going to leave us holding the bag.
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:06.200]  So I don't quote see the US now becoming a sub player and all this.
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:07.880]  That was a foregone conclusion.
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:12.760]  I'm saying now the New World Order, the the the the Anglo-American Empire, as you call
[3:12:12.760 --> 3:12:17.720]  it is moving to that transcendent point where they sit above all the nation states with
[3:12:17.720 --> 3:12:23.320]  their private intelligence networks in Russia, in China, in Israel, in the US, just playing
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:25.280]  us all off against each other.
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:27.400]  I don't believe that they have total world control.
[3:12:27.400 --> 3:12:28.400]  No, I don't.
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:29.800]  I think that there are real conflicts in the world.
[3:12:29.800 --> 3:12:31.400]  I don't think they have total world control.
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:35.200]  I'm saying they are dominant.
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:40.040]  Dominant up to a point, but fading fast and Obama is really a flight forward, a desperate
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:43.600]  bid to give this a facelift, to give it a new lease on life.
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:47.840]  And if you block Obama, you're going to be dealing with a severely weakened imperialism
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:51.800]  under conditions of much greater difficulty in organizing mass.
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:56.240]  Okay, I'm going to skip this break for people behind the scenes watching on prisonplanet.tv
[3:12:56.240 --> 3:13:00.840]  and listening on the exclusive info wars.com streams and then at 24 after, I promise no
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:03.480]  more pontificating by myself or Webster.
[3:13:03.480 --> 3:13:04.480]  It's all great info.
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:08.760]  Steve, Rico, Elliot, Cliff, Jeff and many others were going to go right to you in about
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:12.680]  five minutes, but okay, how does it affect the American people?
[3:13:12.680 --> 3:13:17.120]  Let's be centered on ourselves for a minute and take the local regional view for North
[3:13:17.120 --> 3:13:18.680]  America.
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:22.560]  What is better for the American people, for the empire to crumble and fall apart or for
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:24.000]  us to mindlessly support it?
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:26.040]  Obviously, I believe mindlessly supporting it.
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:31.680]  They will only rape us that much more financially and physically, and so it is good to let this
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:32.680]  fall apart.
[3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:39.960]  I would go with the populists, those prairie farmers back in 1890 meeting in Omaha and they
[3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:44.600]  formulated the populist party program, which basically said a mass movement needs to take
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:49.600]  over the government and turn it against Rockefeller, Morgan and the Wall Street group, and I don't
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:51.880]  think that has changed.
[3:13:51.880 --> 3:13:52.880]  That's what we should be doing.
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:55.800]  So we need a Golden Cross speech.
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:59.640]  Yes, although he's, you know, that's William Jennings Bryan.
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:02.720]  He's not really an organic representative of this.
[3:14:02.720 --> 3:14:08.920]  He is at least a politician who grew up in that milieu, and he's trying to fight Wall
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:09.920]  Street again.
[3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:14.040]  Maybe he's not a good example, but if you want to think who's like us, who's isolated
[3:14:14.040 --> 3:14:20.040]  like we are or relatively with not that much money, take those populists of 1890, and I
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:21.840]  think their strategy is valid.
[3:14:21.840 --> 3:14:23.440]  Now, you want to oppose the empire.
[3:14:23.440 --> 3:14:28.640]  You also want to construct an economic alternative to this, and for me, this is clear.
[3:14:28.640 --> 3:14:30.560]  The New Deal methods worked then.
[3:14:30.560 --> 3:14:31.560]  They will work now.
[3:14:31.560 --> 3:14:32.560]  Oh yeah.
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:36.560]  It's turned us into a bunch of dependents, broken down the family, the same foundations
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:37.560]  you talk about.
[3:14:37.560 --> 3:14:38.560]  This is not the New Deal.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:41.200]  The New Deal has been gone for 40 years.
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:45.320]  Hey, Webster, 100 years ago, the big foundations, as you know, wrote how they were going to
[3:14:45.320 --> 3:14:46.480]  get us addicted to government.
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:48.720]  But see, you've got to be...
[3:14:48.720 --> 3:14:53.800]  Look, I tell you, the populist in Omaha said the government is going to belong to us.
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:55.920]  The goal is not to get government out of your life.
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:57.680]  The goal is you take over the government.
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:03.280]  Now Milton Friedman, of course, from the Rockefeller Chicago School, says government is always
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:04.280]  the problem.
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:05.280]  I don't buy that.
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:06.280]  Wall Street.
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:07.280]  Finance-old ago.
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:08.760]  See, that's only one hand of the elite.
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:09.760]  That's only one hand.
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:13.720]  They claim they don't want government, but in truth, they do want big government to suck
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:15.800]  off us with corporate welfare.
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:17.600]  Again, I don't...
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:20.560]  Hold on, Webster, we're going to behind the scenes.
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:21.560]  I want to abbreviate this.
[3:15:21.560 --> 3:15:22.560]  We'll be right back.
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:23.560]  Okay.
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:24.560]  Go ahead now.
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:25.560]  We've got four minutes.
[3:15:25.560 --> 3:15:29.280]  I don't see that as the meaningful distinction, in the words you...
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:33.440]  Right now, you've got the question of foreclosures.
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:38.600]  If you leave this to the market, or if you leave it to the stuff we've got in place right
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:42.560]  now, we're going to have millions and millions of people thrown out of their homes, and we're
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:46.280]  going to have millions and millions of domestic refugees and homeless.
[3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:47.360]  How do you stop that?
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:49.200]  You do it with a uniform federal law.
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:50.200]  No foreclosures.
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:51.880]  Foreclosures are over.
[3:15:51.880 --> 3:15:53.800]  You foreclose, you go to Leavenworth.
[3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:57.880]  On a home, on a farm, on a business, a taxi company, a trucking company...
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:02.560]  Well, then people just stop paying completely, and then things really implode.
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:05.160]  And then we owe interest on all that debt to the bankers.
[3:16:05.160 --> 3:16:06.440]  But no, we're going to wipe them out.
[3:16:06.440 --> 3:16:10.120]  In other words, what do you do with the quadrillion or two quadrillion of derivatives is you wipe
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:11.120]  them out.
[3:16:11.120 --> 3:16:12.200]  You could do it two ways.
[3:16:12.200 --> 3:16:17.200]  You can do it with a law that simply says derivatives are illegal because they are, as
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:22.320]  they were up until the early 1990s, or my method, tax them out of existence.
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:25.920]  Put a 1% token tax, or come out of...
[3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:32.360]  And because they're blind, shorting, naked shorting, and there's no real money behind
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:34.520]  it, they won't even belly up for a 1%?
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:38.800]  Well, yeah, we're paying, you know, I don't know what the sales tax in Texas is.
[3:16:38.800 --> 3:16:40.480]  It's 5% in Maryland.
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:41.480]  It's 7.
[3:16:41.480 --> 3:16:43.000]  And you don't pay it on groceries.
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:47.200]  In Virginia, it's 5 to 7, and you pay it on groceries.
[3:16:47.200 --> 3:16:48.840]  The groceries is a big part of it.
[3:16:48.840 --> 3:16:52.200]  How come the Wall Street finance oligarchs can't pay their fair share?
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:57.560]  How about that token tax, that securities transfer tax, on if it's two quadrillion of
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:17:03.400]  derivatives, a 1% tax, and suppose two-thirds of that is in the U.S., you're up to about
[3:17:03.400 --> 3:17:04.400]  1.2 million...
[3:17:04.400 --> 3:17:08.520]  Well, derivatives are predominantly global, and so the global government will have to
[3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:09.520]  implement that.
[3:17:09.520 --> 3:17:10.520]  But no, wait.
[3:17:10.520 --> 3:17:12.520]  There's no global government.
[3:17:12.520 --> 3:17:17.400]  The United States government, using sovereign economic powers, can tax J.P. Morgan Chase
[3:17:17.400 --> 3:17:19.040]  and say, well, you have 500 million...
[3:17:19.040 --> 3:17:24.000]  Well, you said the token tax, and that was introduced as a world tax.
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:28.600]  I have a better way to do it, which is to not just to tax foreign exchange transactions,
[3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:31.520]  but to tax all financial turnover.
[3:17:31.520 --> 3:17:33.720]  It would be a speculation tax.
[3:17:33.720 --> 3:17:39.440]  Right now, 40% of the price of oil, or 50%, is pure speculation.
[3:17:39.440 --> 3:17:40.600]  What are you going to do about that?
[3:17:40.600 --> 3:17:45.880]  If you want the market, that speculation will get even worse, because even the regulatory
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:48.560]  regime we have, which is a joke, will be gone.
[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:51.840]  They'll be gouging you without surcease.
[3:17:51.840 --> 3:17:55.000]  What you've got to do is to say, all right, you want to speculate, you're going to pay
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:17:58.080]  a 1% token tax on all the derivatives...
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:02.400]  Well, you can also make it illegal to engage in all this leveraging where they don't even
[3:18:02.400 --> 3:18:03.400]  put money in.
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:04.400]  Yeah, right.
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:08.880]  But now you're talking about government action dictated by the people against the financiers.
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:10.400]  That's all it comes down to.
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:11.800]  Take over the government, use it against...
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:12.800]  Well, here's an example.
[3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:17.040]  I'm sure, look at government education and what it's done.
[3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:19.440]  Before we didn't have government education, I have the smartest, most educated people
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:20.440]  in the world.
[3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:24.120]  Now, I hear people in stores talking about Russia is attacking Georgia, in the U.S.
[3:18:24.120 --> 3:18:26.520]  There's a total watershed that you've got to be aware of.
[3:18:26.520 --> 3:18:32.760]  In 1968, the new deal came to an end, and this was by the folly of Johnson, by the
[3:18:32.760 --> 3:18:33.760]  Vietnam War.
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:34.760]  And they gave us the great society.
[3:18:34.760 --> 3:18:35.760]  And all the rest.
[3:18:35.760 --> 3:18:39.480]  What we've had for 40 years after that is the rule of the reactionary republicans.
[3:18:39.480 --> 3:18:42.120]  It's the social engineering's what we've had.
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:46.640]  We have had the eugenicist carrying this out while the bleeding heart liberals run around
[3:18:46.640 --> 3:18:47.640]  saying help the poor people.
[3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:48.640]  Yeah.
[3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:51.920]  This is all relevant, but the thing you've got to focus on is production.
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:52.920]  The de-industrial...
[3:18:52.920 --> 3:18:53.920]  I'm telling you this.
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:57.200]  Any government system you come up with, no matter how well-meaning, will be hijacked
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:18:58.880]  by the oligarchs, and it always is.
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:03.120]  Well, then it sounds like we live in a hopelessly fallen world, and there's nothing to do about
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:04.120]  anything.
[3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:07.000]  No, if we remove a lot of the taxation mechanisms against us, I'm all for taxing them.
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:08.960]  But you notice we'll never get that.
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:09.960]  Then...
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:13.560]  It has been done in the past, and the new deal was essentially that, and it can be done
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:14.560]  again.
[3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:16.160]  Okay, we're coming back to the main transmission right now.
[3:19:16.160 --> 3:19:17.160]  Okay.
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:18.160]  I want to come in with intro music, folks.
[3:19:18.160 --> 3:19:19.160]  I want to take phone calls.
[3:19:19.160 --> 3:19:20.160]  We're talking to Webster Tarpley.
[3:19:20.160 --> 3:19:21.160]  Here we go.
[3:19:21.160 --> 3:19:47.160]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah, I've never been
[3:19:47.160 --> 3:19:57.560]  seen.
[3:19:57.560 --> 3:20:09.480]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while pieces
[3:20:09.480 --> 3:20:12.960]  arealia nurnosis.
[3:20:12.960 --> 3:20:20.760]  He is the author of Obama, the postmodernist coup, available at infowars.com.
[3:20:20.760 --> 3:20:23.480]  Your phone calls right now.
[3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:28.720]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide as we blast out on AM and FM dial across the
[3:20:28.720 --> 3:20:29.720]  country.
[3:20:29.720 --> 3:20:34.200]  Global shortwave at WWCR, the internet at infowars.com.
[3:20:34.200 --> 3:20:38.480]  And of course, with now more than 60,000 people a day pulling our free podcast.
[3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:41.800]  If you haven't done it, check it out, listen how you want, when you want, where you want.
[3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:47.360]  And of course, number one on Shoutcast, number one on the internet for radio listeners.
[3:20:47.360 --> 3:20:54.040]  Webster Tarpley, continuing with your analysis, let's get the take of the callers.
[3:20:54.040 --> 3:20:56.760]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide.
[3:20:56.760 --> 3:21:01.600]  Well, first of all, I want to say I'm talking to two fine men.
[3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:06.680]  Secondly, I think that you guys have been turned around backwards on this situation
[3:21:06.680 --> 3:21:07.920]  with Russia.
[3:21:07.920 --> 3:21:13.520]  You didn't even report that last month, it was July 25th, Putin had threatened the United
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:17.440]  States with stationing atomic bombers in Cuba.
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:26.120]  Look, Putin has been warning the U.S. loyally, all through 2007, at that Munich-Verkwinter
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:28.520]  meeting in the springtime.
[3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:31.720]  He talked about this neocon striving for the U.S.
[3:21:31.720 --> 3:21:32.720]  Stop, stop Tarpley.
[3:21:32.720 --> 3:21:35.800]  I'm going to get to it in a minute, because this is, Steve, you can't listen to four hours
[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:36.800]  every day.
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:37.800]  I don't believe it.
[3:21:37.800 --> 3:21:42.240]  I've been saying for the last however many months, since this was said, I talk about
[3:21:42.240 --> 3:21:43.240]  that every week.
[3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:47.720]  I talk about their foreign minister saying, if you keep moving weapons systems and troops
[3:21:47.720 --> 3:21:54.560]  and training, and he's stabilizing in Poland and in Czech Republic and in Georgia and in
[3:21:54.560 --> 3:22:00.040]  Ukraine and in all these areas and in the stands, and in moving your military in, we're
[3:22:00.040 --> 3:22:04.840]  going to start moving nukes near you, and I have said that on record.
[3:22:04.840 --> 3:22:05.840]  But so go ahead.
[3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:09.280]  Okay, so you're reporting your point of view.
[3:22:09.280 --> 3:22:12.800]  You don't ever mention the people in Eastern and Central Europe talking about a domino
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:17.360]  theory, where the situation is the dialectic.
[3:22:17.360 --> 3:22:18.360]  In other words, Russia-
[3:22:18.360 --> 3:22:20.760]  Sir, Russia, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.
[3:22:20.760 --> 3:22:23.120]  Russia is shrinking, not getting bigger.
[3:22:23.120 --> 3:22:27.840]  It wasn't Russia that snuck attack a U.S. military base last Thursday night.
[3:22:27.840 --> 3:22:30.640]  It was the United States, which isn't our government anymore.
[3:22:30.640 --> 3:22:31.840]  I'm just stating facts.
[3:22:31.840 --> 3:22:36.280]  I can't stand communists or leftism or any of this stuff.
[3:22:36.280 --> 3:22:39.600]  I'm here trying to give you a real geopolitical view into this.
[3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:44.080]  Did Georgia not blow the hell out of an entire city and massacre a bunch of Russian troops
[3:22:44.080 --> 3:22:48.960]  and peacekeepers out of a clear blue sky, where they've been since 1991, in a ceasefire
[3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:52.600]  in two areas that have always been part of Russia?
[3:22:52.600 --> 3:22:55.320]  Ossetia, go ahead.
[3:22:55.320 --> 3:22:57.200]  Wait a minute.
[3:22:57.200 --> 3:23:01.080]  If what you say were true, the first thing they would have done was blow that tunnel
[3:23:01.080 --> 3:23:07.120]  between Ossetia and North Ossetia, the Roky Tunnel.
[3:23:07.120 --> 3:23:09.240]  You can only get tanks or trucks in one area.
[3:23:09.240 --> 3:23:10.240]  Hold on.
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:11.720]  What are you saying I'm lying about?
[3:23:11.720 --> 3:23:12.720]  Well, what I'm saying is-
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:15.200]  I mean, Georgia admits they snuck attack Russia.
[3:23:15.200 --> 3:23:16.840]  I doubt that.
[3:23:16.840 --> 3:23:17.840]  There were-
[3:23:17.840 --> 3:23:18.840]  Hold on a minute.
[3:23:18.840 --> 3:23:20.000]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:21.000]  This is too insane.
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:22.000]  Okay.
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:26.880]  I mean, Georgia, Tarpley, what do you say to something like this?
[3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:28.480]  Well, this is the U.S. media line.
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:29.480]  This is CNN.
[3:23:29.480 --> 3:23:30.480]  This is what Bush says.
[3:23:30.480 --> 3:23:34.040]  This is what Zalme Khalilzad says at the United Nations.
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:36.960]  What McCain says and what Obama says, and it's a big lie.
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:38.720]  It's a Gribble's big lie.
[3:23:38.720 --> 3:23:40.600]  The aggressor is Georgia.
[3:23:40.600 --> 3:23:42.480]  You have whatever the status quo was.
[3:23:42.480 --> 3:23:46.920]  The Russian peacekeepers were there under a signed agreement with the Georgian government
[3:23:46.920 --> 3:23:47.920]  from 15 years ago.
[3:23:47.920 --> 3:23:52.040]  And let me add, the Georgians had already been taking potshots at the Russian troops
[3:23:52.040 --> 3:23:56.920]  and citizens, beating people up, killing them in the outlying towns around Ossetia.
[3:23:56.920 --> 3:24:02.160]  And cleansing, that's what the Russians had to come in in 1992, 93, and then let me expand.
[3:24:02.160 --> 3:24:07.280]  They shut the water off to Ossetia a month ago and already had them under siege.
[3:24:07.280 --> 3:24:11.320]  And they basically had a campaign of bombings and assassinations building up to this.
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:14.880]  So it's a cynical, orchestrated plan by Georgian.
[3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:18.680]  Now the Russians see it coming and they say, fine, you want to attack, we'll be ready for
[3:24:18.680 --> 3:24:19.680]  you.
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:21.920]  And the minute they attack, they took the bridge and the tunnels.
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:22.920]  But look, Steve, I don't think-
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:25.280]  I would also ask, ultimately, beyond all the details.
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:30.080]  You want to have your children incinerated in the thermonuclear fireball for the sake
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:32.920]  of that bandit, that little Hitler, Sakashvili?
[3:24:32.920 --> 3:24:33.920]  That's crazy.
[3:24:33.920 --> 3:24:35.160]  Look, I'm going to come back to you, Steve.
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:37.320]  We're going to skip this break, too, for infowars.com.
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:39.400]  There's got to go to those streams, folks.
[3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:42.960]  But I mean, this is completely- Steve, I'm blown away here.
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:47.400]  You think I'd go on air and lie to you about Georgia attacking Russia?
[3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:50.640]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[3:24:50.640 --> 3:24:54.200]  I mean, are you serious, Steve?
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:55.880]  Hey, Steve, back up.
[3:24:55.880 --> 3:24:56.880]  He's there.
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:24:57.880]  Steve, are you there?
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:01.440]  All right, we're not going to break and see if we can get Steve raised back up on the
[3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:02.440]  phone.
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:03.840]  Steve, it's just incredible.
[3:25:03.840 --> 3:25:07.120]  I mean, all I do is report the facts here.
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:09.360]  And I'm living in La La Land.
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:10.520]  More of your calls right now.
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:11.920]  Stay with us.
[3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:16.880]  Webster, this is just getting too crazy when people are in total denial.
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:20.600]  Are you still there, Steve, or did you hang up?
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:21.600]  I guess, Steve-
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:22.600]  Okay, it looks like it dropped off.
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:23.600]  Steve finally dropped off.
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:27.560]  We'll call back at 1-800-25 at 999-231 if you can get back in.
[3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:32.360]  Webster, Webster, that is just flabbergasting all the media at the footnotes.
[3:25:32.360 --> 3:25:36.240]  If you'll just read the bottom of the articles, admit Georgia ran a sneak attack, and he's
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:38.440]  saying we're making stuff up.
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:43.520]  Robert Kagan, the neocon Robert Kagan in the Washington Post yesterday says, we're not
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:45.840]  interested in the details of how this started.
[3:25:45.840 --> 3:25:49.240]  In other words, the massacre of 2,000 people in the middle of the night.
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:50.560]  Forget those details.
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:52.320]  Let's look at the big picture.
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:56.240]  Well, the Russians had to move in there, or it would have set a precedent for them to
[3:25:56.240 --> 3:25:58.200]  start leveraging into Russia proper.
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:02.560]  Imagine, this is direct killing of Russian soldiers.
[3:26:02.560 --> 3:26:08.520]  Attacking police bases, military bases, blowing the daylights out of them, midnight sneak attack,
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:13.920]  admitted, then CNN shows the Georgian missile launchers firing and says they're Russian.
[3:26:13.920 --> 3:26:14.920]  That's now come out.
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:18.880]  I mean, just they treat the public like they're complete idiots, and I guess some of them
[3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:20.200]  really want to be lied to.
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:25.080]  And look, this is the same media that brought you 9-11 and the Iraq war and Obama, and now
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:26.840]  they're trying to bring you this.
[3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:32.080]  And also the ones two years ago when the Israelis invaded Lebanon, we were supposed to sympathize
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:33.080]  with the Israelis.
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:35.360]  Yeah, they called that a Lebanese attack.
[3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:36.360]  Right.
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:37.360]  Same thing.
[3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:38.360]  Hezbollah is really bad.
[3:26:38.360 --> 3:26:39.360]  Yeah.
[3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:40.360]  All right.
[3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:41.360]  So this is, it's just a fraud.
[3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:46.800]  And the first Gulf War, and now the, oh listen, listen, I had a news guy at the rail station
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:51.440]  on a show at syndicated on Sundays, kind of argue with me, and he was going, you're saying
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:26:55.520]  Georgia attacked, and I'm just going, you know what, I can't deal with this anymore.
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:27:02.560]  I mean, I just, it is also the question, the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia.
[3:27:02.560 --> 3:27:08.560]  I know the media said the Serbs attacked when for years we had this al-Qaeda being funded
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:09.560]  attacking.
[3:27:09.560 --> 3:27:10.560]  Yeah.
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:16.720]  You have the KLA or UCK, which is this terrorist, gun-running, drug-running, slave-running
[3:27:16.720 --> 3:27:17.720]  organization.
[3:27:17.720 --> 3:27:19.280]  They're supposed to sympathize with them.
[3:27:19.280 --> 3:27:20.280]  Anyway.
[3:27:20.280 --> 3:27:21.280]  Let's take another call.
[3:27:21.280 --> 3:27:22.280]  Rise and see not.
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:23.280]  Rico in Toronto.
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:26.280]  You're on the air.
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:27.280]  Come on ahead, Rico.
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:28.280]  Okay.
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:29.280]  Yeah, thanks.
[3:27:29.280 --> 3:27:35.000]  I was going to say, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:44.320]  Like, take for example, the illegal alien situation, and in the late 60s, early 70s,
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:53.200]  like, all these radical groups were always funded and controlled by like big foundations,
[3:27:53.200 --> 3:28:00.480]  big money, and they were actually encouraged to have problems, to create problems, should
[3:28:00.480 --> 3:28:05.440]  I say, so that basically the police would come, the state would come.
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:06.760]  Yeah, so they can balkanize.
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:08.240]  Same thing with the Black Panthers.
[3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:09.680]  They go in and radicalize.
[3:28:09.680 --> 3:28:10.680]  Stay there, Rico.
[3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:11.680]  We're coming back on the main broadcast.
[3:28:11.680 --> 3:28:14.880]  I want to get Webster's tarply take on that, then I'll give you a counterpoint or another
[3:28:14.880 --> 3:28:18.720]  statement or question after that with Rico in Toronto, then Elliot Jeff, Cliff, and others.
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:21.320]  We've got to move quick with calls, though, because I want to get a lot of your questions
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:22.320]  in.
[3:28:22.320 --> 3:28:25.320]  Here we go.
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:27.320]  Okay.
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:33.800]  We were just talking to Rico on the infowars.com behind the scenes streams.
[3:28:33.800 --> 3:28:35.480]  You go to infowars.com.
[3:28:35.480 --> 3:28:38.920]  Those specific exclusive streams of the behind the scenes.
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:41.200]  We are talking to Rico in Toronto.
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:45.920]  We brought up how the Big Foundations fund LaRaza, Machia, the radical Black Separatist
[3:28:45.920 --> 3:28:50.760]  groups, all of this to get us all fighting with each other, and so then they can radicalize
[3:28:50.760 --> 3:28:56.000]  peaceful groups so those groups never get true equality or freedom or economic mobility.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:59.360]  They get neutralized, bitter, and filled with hate.
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:00.360]  More balkanization.
[3:29:00.360 --> 3:29:01.360]  Webster Tarply.
[3:29:01.360 --> 3:29:05.080]  This is an absolutely critical theme, and you're absolutely right.
[3:29:05.080 --> 3:29:09.560]  If you look first of all at Obama, he is more than anything else a product of the foundation.
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:12.960]  His mother was an operative for the Ford Foundation.
[3:29:12.960 --> 3:29:18.440]  Obama has worked for the Gamaliel Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, Gun Control, the Woods
[3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:25.520]  Fund, the Annenberg Foundation, playing Black parents against the Black Teachers Union.
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:29.920]  His friend Bernardine Dorn gets huge money from the MacArthur Foundation.
[3:29:29.920 --> 3:29:36.520]  My research for my next book, which is Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography, reveals
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:41.200]  that the weathermen were actually founded with the Ford Foundation grant, certainly
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:47.920]  Floyd McKessick, Stokely Carmichael, the worst firebrands, Rat Brown, these characters, the
[3:29:47.920 --> 3:29:52.640]  people who opposed Martin Luther King with their incendiary rhetoric, all foundation
[3:29:52.640 --> 3:29:53.640]  funded.
[3:29:53.640 --> 3:29:57.560]  And as you correctly point out, the worst provocateurs of the Hispanic community, the
[3:29:57.560 --> 3:30:03.160]  people who talk this insanity about carving up the United States, they're also foundation
[3:30:03.160 --> 3:30:04.160]  funded.
[3:30:04.160 --> 3:30:08.440]  Obama has friends like Khalidi and a bunch of others.
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:13.360]  This is the foundation funded pro-US wing of the PLO.
[3:30:13.360 --> 3:30:17.400]  Among the Native Americans, you've got a guy like Ward Churchill, who is essentially in
[3:30:17.400 --> 3:30:19.640]  the same corner.
[3:30:19.640 --> 3:30:25.520]  The pervasive activity of these foundations is one of the things that's destroying American
[3:30:25.520 --> 3:30:26.520]  society.
[3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:31.960]  Obama is somebody who says he was a community organizer for the Gamaliel Foundation.
[3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:36.600]  What he's really saying is, I was a poverty pimp for the foundation world where the Ford
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:40.160]  Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation dominate.
[3:30:40.160 --> 3:30:43.080]  This is one of the principal things about Obama.
[3:30:43.080 --> 3:30:47.560]  This is what he comes from, his world, that stuff about the bitter clingers, the people
[3:30:47.560 --> 3:30:51.200]  who cling to religion and guns, and anti-trade.
[3:30:51.200 --> 3:30:54.640]  That is the foundation trilateral point of view.
[3:30:54.640 --> 3:30:58.040]  You cannot have a president who hates the American people.
[3:30:58.040 --> 3:31:02.880]  In the case of Obama, he does hate the American people, and therefore he's going to attack
[3:31:02.880 --> 3:31:05.800]  this austerity program with great gusto.
[3:31:05.800 --> 3:31:10.320]  Unlike Carter, who probably had some Christian scruples about it, Obama won't have nothing
[3:31:10.320 --> 3:31:15.200]  of the sort, because he's been worshiping in a Ford Foundation church that Reverend
[3:31:15.200 --> 3:31:19.880]  Jeremiah Wright with Dwight Hopkins as an operative of the Ford Foundation, Reverend
[3:31:19.880 --> 3:31:25.040]  Otis Moss got through college with the Ford Foundation, this whole James Cohn Black Liberation
[3:31:25.040 --> 3:31:31.080]  Theology is, again, the Ford Foundation Union Theological Seminary School of this stuff,
[3:31:31.080 --> 3:31:35.040]  and it is designed to perpetuate racial conflict.
[3:31:35.040 --> 3:31:39.600]  Absolutely, and they fund all these groups, they do it to get everybody at each other's
[3:31:39.600 --> 3:31:48.160]  throats, and then the racial tension becomes real, and then it's a dynamo which just builds
[3:31:48.160 --> 3:31:50.040]  up force and strength.
[3:31:50.040 --> 3:31:51.040]  Anything else, Rico?
[3:31:51.040 --> 3:31:55.600]  Yeah, my second point, something yet brought up a couple weeks ago when you were talking
[3:31:55.600 --> 3:32:01.480]  about the anthrax letter that the Bush enemy received.
[3:32:01.480 --> 3:32:09.880]  I remember reading quickly, just the Roman Empire, and it was the same thing.
[3:32:09.880 --> 3:32:10.880]  It was the same thing.
[3:32:10.880 --> 3:32:15.800]  Cicero, a little bit before Caesar came into power, Cicero was saying how the enemies of
[3:32:15.800 --> 3:32:22.040]  Rome need to be dealt with, have received letters, I have letters that say that a couple
[3:32:22.040 --> 3:32:27.800]  senators are going to be mass assassinated, so we need to clamp down, this worked a thousand
[3:32:27.800 --> 3:32:32.240]  years ago, it works again, it's the same thing, nothing's changed.
[3:32:32.240 --> 3:32:37.240]  Well that's what's incredible, I appreciate your call, yeah, I bought a high school textbook,
[3:32:37.240 --> 3:32:43.160]  it was at Barnes & Noble, it's like, I think it's 3,000 years of revolution, and it's
[3:32:43.160 --> 3:32:47.600]  pretty accurate actually, but you just look at every country, just the thousands of revolutions
[3:32:47.600 --> 3:32:53.160]  and all the subterfuge and backstabbing and Machiavellian activity and elites and cloak
[3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:57.400]  and dagger, and then somehow they taught the American people the last 100 years that none
[3:32:57.400 --> 3:33:02.500]  of that exists, everything's fine, go back to sleep, and if we say anything on this show,
[3:33:02.500 --> 3:33:07.400]  it's just start looking around you and realizing that when these elites get out of control
[3:33:07.400 --> 3:33:11.600]  and these warlords and these banker warlords start fighting with each other, the oligarchy
[3:33:11.600 --> 3:33:17.080]  as Webster calls them, when these moneyed, you know, noble interests start battling with
[3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:22.560]  each other, we don't matter in the equation, we get hurt real bad, and this is just a game
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:26.200]  of chess for them, I mean, people say, well why do they want more power, they're already
[3:33:26.200 --> 3:33:30.440]  so rich, when anybody who knows rich people knows, they want even more, they want power,
[3:33:30.440 --> 3:33:34.240]  they want control and to deny that there are people that want power and control is to deny
[3:33:34.240 --> 3:33:35.240]  history.
[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:38.520]  Webster, I want to go call us quickly, but how did we get to the point, do you think,
[3:33:38.520 --> 3:33:43.980]  of the average person, they're now coming out of this delusion and this mesmerized smoke
[3:33:43.980 --> 3:33:48.320]  screen, but people will say, oh there's no subterfuge, there's no corruption, there's
[3:33:48.320 --> 3:33:53.000]  no influence, there's no behind the scenes, you're a crazy dangerous conspiracy theorist,
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:55.880]  how were they able to inculcate that in people's minds?
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:34:00.160]  Well, it's a long process of degradation, I think that the federal question is probably
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:06.520]  the deindustrialization of the United States initiated by Volcker under trilateral Carter
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:12.840]  and Brzezinski auspices and then continued with the union busting of the Reagan years,
[3:34:12.840 --> 3:34:17.760]  the systematic decline in the standard of living, so it's about minus two-thirds of
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:21.000]  what it had been around 1966 or something like that.
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:26.680]  And so people are having to work twice as hard just to keep the illusion going and so
[3:34:26.680 --> 3:34:29.760]  they physically are just disconnected saying, I don't care.
[3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:34.280]  There's also more recently, Obama could not have broken through if the Democratic Party
[3:34:34.280 --> 3:34:39.600]  had not been in chaos, and part of that is Pelosi, Pelosi came in with the mandate of
[3:34:39.600 --> 3:34:42.200]  stopping the Iraq war and she brought the history with it.
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:45.000]  And instead she's ruled with an iron fist saying no.
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:49.360]  And what we then had is as soon as that was in power then Al Gore comes out of the woodwork
[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:57.520]  with his demagogic fake global warming campaign to break the momentum against Bush and against
[3:34:57.520 --> 3:35:02.680]  the Iraq war and then by the end of that year you've got Obama deployed into a chaotic
[3:35:02.680 --> 3:35:03.680]  Democratic party.
[3:35:03.680 --> 3:35:08.920]  Let me stop you because I want to go to Elliott Jeff, Cliff and others in a DJ, but before
[3:35:08.920 --> 3:35:12.920]  we do that I wanted to last hour get into the eugenics angle, which you're a real expert
[3:35:12.920 --> 3:35:13.920]  on Webster.
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:14.920]  I mean I know my stuff on this.
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:18.200]  I wrote over 20 books on the subject and studied it and you know even more in some
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:19.400]  cases than I do.
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:23.520]  In a nutshell, why do they want to reduce our numbers?
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:24.960]  Why do they want to enslave us?
[3:35:24.960 --> 3:35:27.400]  Why do they want to bring feudalism back in?
[3:35:27.400 --> 3:35:33.240]  It's just the instincts of the Anglo-American feudal lords and I mean break that down what
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:36.040]  the fake modern environmentalism is.
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:39.800]  Well, one is the population side.
[3:35:39.800 --> 3:35:43.720]  The oligarchy always argues that there are two main problems in the world.
[3:35:43.720 --> 3:35:48.680]  One is overpopulation, the other is industrial pollution in some form.
[3:35:48.680 --> 3:35:52.880]  To be an oligarch means that you've got to hate the majority of humanity by thinking
[3:35:52.880 --> 3:35:54.920]  that you're better off than they were.
[3:35:54.920 --> 3:35:59.800]  You can go back to the works of Hesiod in ancient Greece, pretty much the beginning
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:03.880]  of the sort of archaic Greek literature.
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:08.040]  The reason for the Trojan War was that there were too many people.
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:12.400]  Too many people were oppressing the breast of Mother Earth and therefore we had to have
[3:36:12.400 --> 3:36:15.360]  the Trojan War to kill off a lot of them.
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:20.760]  In terms of the global warming, I don't need a climatologist to say that this is a fraud.
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:27.720]  As a historian, I can look back to the medieval war period, 1100-1200, when you have grapes
[3:36:27.720 --> 3:36:29.760]  growing in England, grapes growing in...
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:35.240]  Not about hiberium maxim 8,000 years ago, which brought us into the Bronze Age and
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:37.600]  the first city-states.
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:39.680]  It was 10 degrees hotter on average then.
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:40.680]  They have the ice cores.
[3:36:40.680 --> 3:36:41.680]  There's no doubting.
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:46.840]  We are well within the band of fluctuation of historical memory.
[3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:52.840]  The other one, of course, is we have a little ice age around 1600-1625, which corresponds
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:57.560]  to the Spurro minimum and the Maunder minimum in the Sunspot cycle.
[3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:00.760]  It is basically determined by solar activity.
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:04.760]  That's at least a major input, not by human activity at all.
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:09.040]  In that little ice age, you had the ports of Northern Europe, the ports of Germany and
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:13.280]  the Netherlands were one with ice, icebergs.
[3:37:13.280 --> 3:37:18.400]  The idea of being a climatologist means you're charlatan and a fraud because it's a discipline.
[3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:24.080]  It's not meteorology, it's not oceanography, it's not any science, it's not history.
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:28.920]  It's a fake science invented by Al Gore and all during the Clinton years, if you didn't
[3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:31.280]  agree with Al Gore, you would be fired.
[3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:33.720]  Come on, let's give him, he claims he invented the Internet too.
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:39.160]  He certainly is the pimp pusher of it, but the Club of Rome in the early 60s said they
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:43.240]  would use threat of a fake ice age or global warming to bring in global taxes.
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:49.040]  And remember, Aurelio Pecce, the co-founder, was an old fascist and the other one was Alexander
[3:37:49.040 --> 3:37:53.160]  King, who once admitted that the purpose of this was genocide in the Third World.
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:57.800]  He said, you know, the reason we preach this after all is to block development of the Third
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:37:58.800]  World.
[3:37:58.800 --> 3:37:59.800]  That is still the same.
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:04.680]  And that's in the British Commission on Population 44 to 49, which was rolled into State Department
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:05.840]  Memorandum 200.
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:11.600]  Yes, and beyond the 200, remember that this was all institutionalized under Carter, under
[3:38:11.600 --> 3:38:18.720]  Muskie, as global 2000 and global futures under Brzezinski trilateral Rockefeller auspices.
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:22.960]  So you basically got Kissinger as a puppet of Nelson Rockefeller, Brzezinski as a puppet
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:24.480]  of David Rockefeller.
[3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:26.920]  And that's pretty much the way the thing is run.
[3:38:26.920 --> 3:38:27.920]  Continue.
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:28.920]  Flush that out.
[3:38:28.920 --> 3:38:36.080]  Well, then, you know, the idea of having a world population reduction, I.D. at Millward's
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:42.880]  genocide built into the U.S. foreign policy is this global 2000, global futures.
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:43.880]  And then what did they do?
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:48.400]  They turned around and implement that by supporting Paul Pot, who goes very far, right?
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:51.360]  He's the champion in terms of proportional genocide.
[3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:57.320]  I think he manages to kill 30 to 40 percent of the Cambodian population and Khomeini,
[3:38:57.320 --> 3:39:02.640]  who aborts the entire industrialization process of Iran.
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:06.560]  What they're trying to show is that third world populations can be organized against
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:08.880]  themselves to destroy themselves.
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:10.360]  And ultimately, that's what Obama is.
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:15.880]  The fascist mass movement is the organization of a population against itself to destroy
[3:39:15.880 --> 3:39:18.800]  itself in the service of these financiers.
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:23.560]  Let's go to Elliott in Ohio, you're on the air.
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:28.680]  So I researched this maybe two days ago.
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:31.480]  Have you heard of the 1st, 13th Amendment?
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:34.320]  No, I'm afraid I haven't.
[3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:35.320]  Go ahead.
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:38.920]  I was on Jordan Maxwell's side and then I went to one of his lengths.
[3:39:38.920 --> 3:39:45.280]  And yeah, in 1983, these two guys, a research expert, David Dodge and former Baltimore police
[3:39:45.280 --> 3:39:47.520]  investigator, Tom Dunn.
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:51.640]  They were in the Belfast library on the coast of Maine.
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:40:00.640]  They found a constitution from 1825 and there's a missing 13th Amendment in our constitution.
[3:40:00.640 --> 3:40:05.240]  It was ratified in 1819, has not been repealed.
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:09.560]  There were more than 30 original broadsheets made and quite a few of them are still around.
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:12.200]  I've heard of, well, go ahead.
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:15.600]  Well, I mean, it's a title of an ability and honor.
[3:40:15.600 --> 3:40:19.840]  It says, if any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:25.320]  title of an ability or honor, or shall, without consent of Congress, accept and retain any
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:27.800]  present pension, office, or embellishment.
[3:40:27.800 --> 3:40:28.800]  Yeah.
[3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:29.800]  Speak of the devil.
[3:40:29.800 --> 3:40:36.080]  John, I sent you that clip from C-SPAN of former Secretary of State Colin Powell telling
[3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:38.520]  the reporter that he's a night commander order of the bath.
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:39.520]  Will you cue that up, please?
[3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:40.520]  I sure will.
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:41.520]  Thank you.
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:42.520]  Go ahead, Elliott.
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:47.360]  Yeah, retain any present pension, office, or embellishment of any kind, whatever, from
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:52.760]  any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of
[3:40:52.760 --> 3:40:53.760]  the United States.
[3:40:53.760 --> 3:40:56.920]  Yeah, so it's saying you can't be a foreign agent, basically, which makes sense.
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:40:57.920]  And I haven't read it.
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:40:58.920]  Because I may.
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:40:59.920]  I have a certain background.
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:01.560]  Now I know what you're talking about and it does exist.
[3:41:01.560 --> 3:41:06.080]  And I wrote about this in 1996, an executive intelligence review.
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:07.320]  You might find it on the internet.
[3:41:07.320 --> 3:41:12.840]  It's an article that says U.S. Constitution bars Powell from the presidency because he
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:14.840]  had become this British nobleman.
[3:41:14.840 --> 3:41:15.840]  Yeah, we do know of it.
[3:41:15.840 --> 3:41:21.920]  The U.S. Constitution right now says, you cannot hold an office of prophet and trust
[3:41:21.920 --> 3:41:22.920]  under the United States.
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:26.680]  In other words, you can't be in the executive branch or the Supreme Court if you accept
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:28.040]  a title of no purpose.
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:33.040]  And that plays into the Logan Act as in the code blocking that.
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:34.560]  But this one goes further.
[3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:37.960]  It says, if you accept such a title of nobility, you cease to be a citizen of the United States.
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:38.960]  Yes, it's currently in there.
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:39.960]  That's what I know.
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:45.360]  I was ready to attack Rudy, so Rudy Giuliani would have been coming under attack from me
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:47.480]  on this if he had gotten the Republican.
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:48.480]  Yes, Sally.
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:49.960]  If that is legitimate, you refresh our memory.
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:50.960]  Thank you.
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:53.960]  And speaking of Powell and the nobility, here is the audio clip right now.
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:42:18.240]  We have the video clip up on infowars.com.
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:23.920]  We put it up there when Queen Elizabeth II was here in town last year surveying her
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:26.480]  lands.
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:27.560]  They had a White House function.
[3:42:27.560 --> 3:42:30.080]  They were announcing who they were.
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:35.400]  And much of the administration coming in were being announced by their British titles and
[3:42:35.400 --> 3:42:37.680]  giving field to the Queenie.
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:39.640]  So I hope that answers your question, Elliott.
[3:42:39.640 --> 3:42:42.080]  Let's go to Cliff in Virginia.
[3:42:42.080 --> 3:42:43.080]  Cliff here on the air.
[3:42:43.080 --> 3:42:44.080]  Go ahead.
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:45.080]  Hello?
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:46.080]  Yes, Cliff.
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:47.080]  Go ahead.
[3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:48.080]  Yeah.
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:49.080]  How you doing today?
[3:42:49.080 --> 3:42:53.720]  Enjoying your show, by the way, also.
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:43:00.520]  My question is there, Mr. Tarpley, is I read a report several months ago here where China
[3:43:00.520 --> 3:43:05.760]  sent word to Illuminati operatives that if they tried to indeed, you know, make any type
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:11.360]  of move toward China, and it's, shall I say, they're friends, which will be Russia and
[3:43:11.360 --> 3:43:18.800]  Iran via their friendship packs they have and old obligation deals.
[3:43:18.800 --> 3:43:23.680]  What will be the next move for the Illuminati now that Bush, more or less, has gotten punched
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:30.520]  in the mouth by Putin over this Georgia fiasco and the fact that China said plainly stated
[3:43:30.520 --> 3:43:36.640]  that any aggression made toward China and the people around the Illuminati would be
[3:43:36.640 --> 3:43:37.640]  assassinated?
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:38.640]  Yeah.
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:40.360]  I mean, there's two questions there.
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:43.840]  What do you think of Benjamin Fulver, the former Forbes writer who meets with Rockefeller
[3:43:43.840 --> 3:43:49.640]  on video and says he's been told by the Asian elite, the mafia, that they know about the
[3:43:49.640 --> 3:43:53.200]  population reduction plan and the bio weapon attack plan that Cheney talks about, the
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:57.880]  PNAC documents, September 2000, Building America's Defenses, what, so, I mean, A, what do you
[3:43:57.880 --> 3:43:58.880]  think of that?
[3:43:58.880 --> 3:44:04.920]  And then B, again, kind of a recap of why does this, what does this do now that this
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:06.920]  didn't go well in Georgia?
[3:44:06.920 --> 3:44:07.920]  Let me do it the other way.
[3:44:07.920 --> 3:44:13.060]  I don't, I don't use this concept of Illuminati because I think this is just pure confusion.
[3:44:13.060 --> 3:44:19.520]  The notion that a society founded in Bavaria runs the world, in my view, is just absurd.
[3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:25.840]  What you're dealing with is the city of London, British, and Wall Street, the U.S. That's
[3:44:25.840 --> 3:44:27.440]  the operative unit.
[3:44:27.440 --> 3:44:32.720]  And these terms like New World Order and Illuminati, I think they contribute to confusion rather
[3:44:32.720 --> 3:44:33.720]  than...
[3:44:33.720 --> 3:44:36.720]  Even though all these presidents use them and, and, and, and, and Halit and Swear Sovereign
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:37.720]  to...
[3:44:37.720 --> 3:44:39.960]  Yeah, look, the origin of this Illuminati, though, is British intelligence.
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:40.960]  I know.
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:41.960]  They're here to say...
[3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:44.400]  We're not the main enemy in the world.
[3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:46.360]  Those Bavarians are the main enemy.
[3:44:46.360 --> 3:44:47.360]  This is just crazy.
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:49.520]  Now, let me break this down for you, Webster.
[3:44:49.520 --> 3:44:51.520]  There is an element to all of this.
[3:44:51.520 --> 3:44:53.960]  The elites are obsessed with the occult.
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:58.240]  The British system, and let me finish, please, is Masonic.
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:02.320]  And they really are into this, and they really do govern a lot of what they do according
[3:45:02.320 --> 3:45:03.320]  to it.
[3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:04.320]  Sure.
[3:45:04.320 --> 3:45:07.960]  But now you're talking the Scottish-right Freemasons of London and, you know, God knows
[3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:12.560]  other institutions that they have, the Club of the Isles and all sorts of other things.
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:15.880]  But again, this Bavarian thing, this is the crazy part.
[3:45:15.880 --> 3:45:18.240]  This is what the British themselves put out to say.
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:19.640]  Well, that was just one agent.
[3:45:19.640 --> 3:45:22.680]  That was Lysop and the guy getting struck by lightning.
[3:45:22.680 --> 3:45:23.680]  Thank you so much.
[3:45:23.680 --> 3:45:25.760]  But now, wait, let's do the Fulford part.
[3:45:25.760 --> 3:45:30.000]  There is a history of secret societies in China, for example.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:34.960]  Dr. Sun Yat-sen, when he wanted to do the Chinese Revolution in 1911, turned to something
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:40.560]  called the Red Door Society, the Hong Manor, Hong Men Society.
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:46.200]  However, I think this stuff now is, you have to look at this with tremendous skepticism,
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:47.920]  and here's why.
[3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:55.680]  Suppose we have the Turkmen Islamic Party setting off some stunt in Beijing now for
[3:45:55.680 --> 3:45:56.680]  the Olympics.
[3:45:56.680 --> 3:46:05.360]  If that terrorism, either Mexico City 68 or Munich 72 style, you're going to have a wave
[3:46:05.360 --> 3:46:08.520]  of international sympathy with China.
[3:46:08.520 --> 3:46:14.000]  Suppose now the Anglo-Americans have come up with a dialectical or two phase Fulford
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  part.
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  Hold on.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:18.880]  We're going to do three minutes behind the scenes, exclusively at the infowars.com streams
[3:46:18.880 --> 3:46:20.120]  and prismplanet.tv.
[3:46:20.120 --> 3:46:21.120]  Stay with us.
[3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:22.120]  Okay.
[3:46:22.120 --> 3:46:23.120]  You got three minutes, Webster.
[3:46:23.120 --> 3:46:27.840]  Go over this, and we're going to come back and finish up with Jeff and DJ and Matt.
[3:46:27.840 --> 3:46:28.840]  Go ahead.
[3:46:28.840 --> 3:46:35.640]  If you get the US and the British using this Turkmenistan, the tip, the Turkmenistan Islamic
[3:46:35.640 --> 3:46:41.880]  Party, and commanders say fuller that we've seen, pulling a stunt in Beijing with wet
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:46.640]  work, with the bodies, then you're going to get international sympathy with China.
[3:46:46.640 --> 3:46:52.960]  Now, suppose in a second phase of a false flag to magnify the world effect.
[3:46:52.960 --> 3:46:57.280]  It's like going from 9-11 to anthrax, which is something, you know, 9-11 is for people
[3:46:57.280 --> 3:47:02.280]  in big cities only, high rises, but anthrax is for anybody who gets the mail every day.
[3:47:02.280 --> 3:47:07.480]  In other words, everybody in the world, practically, you can imagine a second phase.
[3:47:07.480 --> 3:47:15.080]  Now, suppose the US and the British strike in Beijing, and then they say the Chinese
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:21.200]  secret societies have given a press conference, and they come forward and say, that's it.
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:22.200]  We've had it.
[3:47:22.200 --> 3:47:24.920]  You Anglo-Americans, we've had it up to here.
[3:47:24.920 --> 3:47:26.160]  We're striking back.
[3:47:26.160 --> 3:47:27.800]  We're going to bring down the internet.
[3:47:27.800 --> 3:47:30.720]  We're going to destroy world financial transactions.
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:35.840]  We're going to paralyze the world through the internet with logic bombs, denial of service,
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:38.160]  cyber warfare, and so forth.
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:45.040]  This would then begin to turn world hatred and resentment against China in a very, very
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:46.040]  strong way.
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:50.880]  So I think if anybody believes that there are omnipotent Chinese secret societies, I don't
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:56.040]  think they are, and everybody knew about the Anglo-Americans being genocidal, you know,
[3:47:56.040 --> 3:48:02.480]  going back to this Kissinger memorandum of 1974 or the Carter administration.
[3:48:02.480 --> 3:48:08.760]  Now, John D. Rockefeller III has been very, in his lifetime, very adamant about this stuff.
[3:48:08.760 --> 3:48:14.000]  So I don't think it makes any particular sense that there is this war of the secret
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  societies.
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:19.840]  I think this is the kind of a story that I would approach with the greatest care and
[3:48:19.840 --> 3:48:24.440]  skepticism, because it lends itself to this kind of a false flag scenario.
[3:48:24.440 --> 3:48:27.960]  It's a way to popularize that among people and continue to popularize them.
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:34.160]  We know that Japan and China under the feudal system was run by secret hereditary societies,
[3:48:34.160 --> 3:48:37.400]  and they are dominant in many areas of life today.
[3:48:37.400 --> 3:48:42.320]  And so I think to poo-poo the reality of it is wrong, but also to give it omnipotence,
[3:48:42.320 --> 3:48:46.160]  as you said, I think is to overplay something that is not as...
[3:48:46.160 --> 3:48:49.760]  But if you remember, suppose if you had some group saying, you know, we're the new Red
[3:48:49.760 --> 3:48:54.400]  Door Society and we're destroying the internet, then the U.S. could say, all right, we're
[3:48:54.400 --> 3:48:55.400]  right.
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:48:56.400]  That's it.
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:49:01.760]  Yeah, that's another shadowy, Goldstein type of wreath on which all of these other things
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:03.160]  can be hung like a scarecrow.
[3:49:03.160 --> 3:49:07.440]  Right, and it could be like Sarajevo, in other words, the Austrians say to Serbia, give
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:12.360]  us those criminals, the U.S. could say, okay, China, deliver us the hundred top members
[3:49:12.360 --> 3:49:15.440]  of the Red Door Society, and we're going to take care of them.
[3:49:15.440 --> 3:49:16.440]  The Chinese have to say no.
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:18.800]  We're going to come in with the final segment right now.
[3:49:18.800 --> 3:49:25.800]  I understand, Webster, here we go.
[3:49:25.800 --> 3:49:33.240]  All right, final segment, worldwide transmission, retransmission starts in T-minus, six minutes
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:38.080]  at one place, infowars.com, that's where you can always listen to the show, it'll already
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:42.600]  broadcast 20 hours, and we'll be back live tomorrow, before we jam in a few final calls
[3:49:42.600 --> 3:49:43.600]  for Webster.
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:49.640]  We're going to talk about a fine sponsor, a cola blue, atmosphere water generator, for
[3:49:49.640 --> 3:49:54.400]  home, pays for itself, but then one year, if you buy your water from the store, pure
[3:49:54.400 --> 3:49:58.000]  clean water, without the fluoride and limited water from the humidity in the air, use a
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:03.080]  solar panel system to run it, or plug it into the wall, machine produces up to 7.5 gallons
[3:50:03.080 --> 3:50:08.160]  in a day, in wetter areas, around three gallons, at least two and a half gallons, even the
[3:50:08.160 --> 3:50:13.520]  worst deserts, with the lowest humidity, just an amazing system, great tasting pure H2O,
[3:50:13.520 --> 3:50:19.960]  exactly the way nature makes it, no chemicals, pollutants, or toxins, natural pH, give them
[3:50:19.960 --> 3:50:27.320]  a call, 1-866-585-4044, or check them out at thecolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-blue.com, Big
[3:50:27.320 --> 3:50:38.320]  Banner on infowars.com, 866-585-4044, okay, let's jam in quickly here, let's jam in,
[3:50:38.320 --> 3:50:40.520]  Jeff in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[3:50:40.520 --> 3:50:45.040]  Hi, thanks for taking my call, first time caller, but long time listener, I'll be brief
[3:50:45.040 --> 3:50:51.120]  since I know you're short on time, this does relate to what you've been talking about,
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:55.200]  I read a link this morning, it was from the Financial Times of London, it was written
[3:50:55.200 --> 3:51:02.840]  by Peter Gartham, and it's just a couple sentences long, Ulrich Leutman at Commerce
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:09.080]  Bank said in a note that he expected the dollar to rise, quote, like a Phoenix, quote, unquote,
[3:51:09.080 --> 3:51:13.560]  and he also said that in a very short period of time, quote, unquote, sentiment turned
[3:51:13.560 --> 3:51:19.120]  by 180 degrees, the market now believes that the U.S. economy once again will be able to
[3:51:19.120 --> 3:51:21.200]  leave a crisis behind very quickly.
[3:51:21.200 --> 3:51:24.480]  But they've said this three times in the last year, it always goes up and then further
[3:51:24.480 --> 3:51:29.160]  down the next time, I hope it goes up and they can artificially do it, but all the real
[3:51:29.160 --> 3:51:33.960]  market fundamental show, the dollar has been devalued, they keep printing it, you have
[3:51:33.960 --> 3:51:39.400]  this debt, liquidity, hundreds of millions a month being pumped into financial institutions.
[3:51:39.400 --> 3:51:40.900]  Webster, what do you see happening?
[3:51:40.900 --> 3:51:46.880]  The main thing you have is a violent contraction of employment and production, Detroit is collapsing,
[3:51:46.880 --> 3:51:52.520]  the big three automakers are collapsing, their subcontractors are collapsing, generally speaking,
[3:51:52.520 --> 3:51:57.600]  manufacturing employment in this country is really on its last leg, so this contraction
[3:51:57.600 --> 3:52:03.520]  which is expressed in growing unemployment and growing unreported unemployment, those
[3:52:03.520 --> 3:52:08.800]  who have given up in despair, we'd have to look at things like freight car loadings and
[3:52:08.800 --> 3:52:13.520]  truck loadings, real, tangible, physical, economic indices, and you will see that this
[3:52:13.520 --> 3:52:16.920]  economy is approaching the point of thermodynamic breakdown.
[3:52:16.920 --> 3:52:19.600]  And they're telling us everything's wonderful.
[3:52:19.600 --> 3:52:21.840]  After that, the financial panic will happen.
[3:52:21.840 --> 3:52:25.920]  They put these stories out, the plunge protection team, of course, as everybody knows, props
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:30.840]  them up with the help of helicopter Ben Bernanke, they've now got the entire Wall Street be
[3:52:30.840 --> 3:52:37.160]  at JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, and Goldman, and Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley,
[3:52:37.160 --> 3:52:42.640]  and Merrill, and UBS, all of them are on life support, they're all getting huge injections
[3:52:42.640 --> 3:52:47.400]  of Federal Reserve liquidity, and the question is, you know, how long before that becomes
[3:52:47.400 --> 3:52:51.120]  generalized hyperinflation on the German 1993?
[3:52:51.120 --> 3:52:55.160]  Yeah, we're out of time, we're out of time, we're out of time, sorry to DJ and Matt, call
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:52:58.920]  back tomorrow, I'll put you up first, our next time, Tarbley's on, Webster, thank you
