[00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:06.289]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:08.070]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.812]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.812 --> 00:00:11.393]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.393 --> 00:00:12.294]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:17.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:21.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.183 --> 00:00:43.023]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.505]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:55.169]  We will have continual coverage of the ongoing conflict in Georgia with Russia and U.S.-backed forces.
[00:00:55.169 --> 00:01:03.813]  We have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us coming up in 30 minutes for a short interview, Part 2 of his analysis on what was happening last Friday.
[00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:07.918]  Former Wall Street Journal editor, who's one of our routine contributors.
[00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:08.698]  We're honored to have him.
[00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:13.242]  Of course, also former head of the Treasury Department policy.
[00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.303]  He will be joining us.
[00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:26.473]  And then, we had a heated debate for about an hour a few weeks ago, so I thought we'd have Webster Tarpley back on for a full two hours today to analyze what's happening in Russia, to break that down from his perspective.
[00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:32.506]  To get into the two political parties and who's controlling them and looking forward into this election.
[00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:40.191]  Bill Clinton, of course, scheduled, they announced two days ago, to be introducing the vice presidential candidate.
[00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:46.255]  That means it's guaranteed, or 99.9%, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:54.200]  So, I guess Tarpley will still be telling us that Hillary is going to save us when she's lined up with Obama.
[00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:56.432]  Oh, God help us.
[00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:05.157]  I like Tarpley, and I think he's right on most things, and he's a smart guy, but they're all bought and paid for, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:09.540]  I mean, even trying to pick sides in the U.S.-Russian conflict with a client state, Georgia.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:23.609]  We can't forget that Putin was caught blowing up his own apartment buildings by Moscow police, and then by police in another city, south of there, to blame it on the Chechnyans as a pretext to invade Chechnya.
[00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:39.643]  Now, granted, the US had Al-Qaeda in there attacking Russians, and the Russians needed a reason to send in the full military to get popular support for it, after they'd been demoralized with what happened in Afghanistan.
[00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:41.103]  Now, that was very sick, wasn't it?
[00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:46.365]  There I am, playing through the mindset of the Russian war planners.
[00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:50.707]  That's how easy you fall into this military thought pattern of, well,
[00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:52.549]  We're demoralized.
[00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.972]  We can't fight back against Al-Qaeda, U.S.-backed.
[00:02:56.972 --> 00:03:01.935]  Same Al-Qaeda that attacked Russia to bring the Russians into Afghanistan in 1980.
[00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:07.119]  Attacked six months before in mid-1979.
[00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.440]  And so there's the attitude of Putin.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.681]  I've got to become a strong president.
[00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:11.182]  I've got to have a strong Russia.
[00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:15.365]  The West is gobbling up all of our satellites.
[00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:16.566]  I'm not going to get elected.
[00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:19.848]  Look at this alcoholic I work for, Boris Yeltsin.
[00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:20.969]  Well, I'll just, uh,
[00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:25.257]  An alcoholic who couldn't get out of his chair or talk.
[00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:26.317]  That drugged out.
[00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:27.397]  Probably by Putin.
[00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:30.458]  So they blew up four apartment buildings.
[00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:35.059]  They got caught planting bombs in another two.
[00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.379]  Caught!
[00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.920]  Right-handed!
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.680]  FSB.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.640]  Federal Security Bureau.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.720]  That's where Putin comes from.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.821]  It's the former KGB.
[00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.822]  He was the head of that in Leningrad, Stalingrad, St.
[00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:47.482]  Petersburg, whatever the name of it is this week.
[00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:56.187]  So, uh, we will be, uh, going over that for you today.
[00:03:56.187 --> 00:03:57.107]  Man, I got a marathon.
[00:03:57.107 --> 00:04:02.889]  I'm on with Tex Mars for an hour today after I got off the air, taping his radio show, and I've got other radio interviews tonight.
[00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.249]  I met Raleigh James last night.
[00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:16.634]  I'm not whining, but... I tell you what, it'd be great to be like one of these national TV hosts where they do it one time, one place, once a day, get it all right, and get it all out, and then you're done!
[00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:21.987]  Well, that's why we got the new office center gearing up, the TV show, and then maybe TV network.
[00:04:21.987 --> 00:04:24.609]  We are busting our buns to gear up and do that.
[00:04:24.609 --> 00:04:28.091]  Though we have such small personnel, it takes time to then grow.
[00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.814]  Those first few steps of growth are the hardest.
[00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:35.116]  And you gotta keep people around the office busy bees.
[00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:40.840]  They all work hard, but they get myopically focused in on little tasks and then not on to the greater task.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.603]  But we are moving forward here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:46.244]  All right, I got a ton of news.
[00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.556]  A town in Arkansas has declared martial law.
[00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:54.137]  Not kidding.
[00:04:54.137 --> 00:04:54.838]  We'll cover that.
[00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:56.100]  This is so much today.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.921]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.543]  Oh, the nuclear weapons Russia moved in.
[00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:14.228]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:18.051]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:25.272]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:05:25.272 --> 00:05:28.693]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:05:28.693 --> 00:05:36.574]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:05.705]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:07.988]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:21.449]  I've done an analysis of the Georgian leadership and basically the entire leadership
[00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:48.652]  Is made up of Israeli or slash NATO slash British government operatives.
[00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:54.394]  The Minister of Defense and the Foreign Minister are both Israeli Mossad, former defense officers themselves.
[00:08:54.394 --> 00:08:56.755]  I mean, you can't make stuff up like this.
[00:08:56.755 --> 00:09:05.498]  A bunch of the other top echelon are openly, you know, former officers in the NATO structure.
[00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:08.259]  Many of them aren't even from Georgia.
[00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:10.520]  Basically, it's just, they don't even bother.
[00:09:11.673 --> 00:09:14.936]  To have anybody from Georgia but Mikhail Shasvili.
[00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:19.460]  So we're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.162]  Also, Democracy Now!
[00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:30.812]  had an Air Force weapons expert on, going into the fact that Russia clearly rolled nukes, tactical nukes, into Georgian space.
[00:09:31.824 --> 00:09:33.545]  Menacing, uh, any U.S.
[00:09:33.545 --> 00:09:35.106]  retaliatory action.
[00:09:35.106 --> 00:09:44.130]  McCain, the neocons are all threatening how they want war, military action against Russia.
[00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:51.634]  There's nothing more pathetic than William Crystal, that little demonic dwarf, shooting his mouth off about nuclear war every five minutes.
[00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:53.975]  It's just incredible.
[00:09:53.975 --> 00:09:57.377]  Here's some bad news for everybody that I want to go ahead and cover first, though.
[00:09:58.018 --> 00:10:01.941]  Ron Paul's wife in serious condition in hospital.
[00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:03.283]  Associated Press.
[00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:09.648]  This has been out for 15 hours and I just now learned of it and scanned through the Patriot sites this morning and didn't see anybody covering it.
[00:10:09.648 --> 00:10:13.311]  We're getting it up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:17.114]  Ron Paul's wife is in serious condition in hospital.
[00:10:17.114 --> 00:10:18.636]  The wife a Republican.
[00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:21.338]  Representative Ron Paul is in serious but stable condition.
[00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:41.477]  Monday night, at a hospital, a spokesman for the congressman said, Carol Paul was in critical care, but at an unidentified hospital, spokesman Jesse Bitton said in a statement, Bitton would not disclose why Carol Paul was admitted to the hospital Monday, only saying she has had several abdominal surgeries.
[00:10:41.477 --> 00:10:51.845]  So it could be anything, endometriosis, it could be, you know, anything in her intestines, in her uterus, you have no idea what it could be.
[00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:56.408]  Paul appreciates the outpouring of concern and good wishes during this difficult time, Benton said.
[00:10:56.408 --> 00:11:05.213]  A Texas congressman from Lake Jackson, Ron Paul, was a Libertarian Party nominee for president in 88, and ran unsuccessfully for the 2008 GOP presidential nomination.
[00:11:05.213 --> 00:11:11.556]  His campaign, which was a sensation on the internet, drew support from Republicans, Independents, and Democrats.
[00:11:11.556 --> 00:11:18.160]  So she is in the hospital in Houston, and it could be anything.
[00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:28.523]  So we will continue to give you any developments on that as they unfold.
[00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:37.090]  Carol Paul in a critical, in serious but stable condition.
[00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.992]  In serious but stable condition.
[00:11:39.992 --> 00:11:43.035]  Okay.
[00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:47.058]  Before I get into Russia and is there a ceasefire?
[00:11:47.058 --> 00:11:49.120]  Are the Russians ceasing military operations?
[00:11:52.654 --> 00:11:59.497]  The President had said they had about eight hours ago, but there's still reports of the Georgians firing at the Russians.
[00:11:59.497 --> 00:12:00.678]  That's what they do.
[00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:07.081]  They continue to fire and then say, they've done this for the last four days, and then say, oh my God, Russia's attacking us for no reason.
[00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:22.129]  CNN, BBC, we have mainstream reports on this, have all been caught showing images since Friday morning of self-propelled rocket arrays, tanks,
[00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:36.301]  Attacking Ossetia from the Georgian side, attacking the Russian enclave, and then they put it on the news, and I noticed this Friday, and frankly, I bought it.
[00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:37.942]  I mean, I get conned.
[00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:39.122]  I make mistakes.
[00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:50.628]  I mean, to realize the media is that deceptive, lies that much, is really hard to come to grips with and hard to deal with.
[00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:55.088]  I mean, I knew that it was an enclave, Russian enclave.
[00:12:55.088 --> 00:13:05.636]  I knew that Georgia had been building up with U.S.-Israeli and NATO support.
[00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:20.366]  I was aware of all of that, but as we started reporting at about 11.24 here on the show Friday, when it finally hit our news, it was overshadowed by the Olympics.
[00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.307]  When it finally hit,
[00:13:23.513 --> 00:13:29.497]  I went on to CNN and the rest of it, and the headlines were, Georgian President says Russia attacking it.
[00:13:29.497 --> 00:13:39.223]  And then I turned on the video reports on the television and on the internet, streaming from CNN and Fox, and it showed Ossetti vehicles.
[00:13:39.223 --> 00:13:42.266]  I've now had time to go look at the insignias, blow them up, it's confirmed.
[00:13:42.266 --> 00:13:48.870]  I didn't just believe the Russian media, I went and blew it up and looked at it last night and this morning, and it is confirmed that they were showing
[00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:56.975]  Georgian military attacking civilians with rockets and artillery and saying the Russians were doing it.
[00:13:56.975 --> 00:13:59.296]  I mean, I know the media lies.
[00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:10.098]  I know they feed us a steady diet of pure bull, but can you almost even blame the public when there's just pure lies and distortions coming out of the control corporate press on key issues, on key events?
[00:14:10.098 --> 00:14:11.198]  It's almost total lies.
[00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:14.199]  On other events, it might be half-truth or 90% truth or just spin.
[00:14:16.275 --> 00:14:19.978]  Or there's a lot of news that isn't completely controlled, that's mainstream, that comes out that tells the truth.
[00:14:19.978 --> 00:14:27.003]  Like, cops taser a young man 19 times, and you can judge what you think of that.
[00:14:27.003 --> 00:14:31.406]  So we look at multiple sources, and that's how we use mainstream and alternative media.
[00:14:31.406 --> 00:14:32.186]  Do we get everything right?
[00:14:32.186 --> 00:14:33.167]  No.
[00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:35.869]  We get it more often right than wrong.
[00:14:35.869 --> 00:14:38.331]  In fact, about 95% of the time we get it right.
[00:14:38.331 --> 00:14:43.074]  And in hindsight, we always get it right as we analyze things, but that was the level of deception.
[00:14:43.074 --> 00:14:44.555]  I was on the air Friday saying,
[00:14:47.263 --> 00:14:56.388]  Well, it's showing Russian tanks and Russian artillery pieces and missile systems firing, because that's what CNN was saying.
[00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:59.709]  And I noticed it was always far away shots.
[00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:00.270]  They knew.
[00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.810]  They lied.
[00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.832]  That's what they do.
[00:15:05.832 --> 00:15:11.475]  Now, within minutes, we got it straight and said, now wait a minute, this says in the bottom of all these stories that
[00:15:16.104 --> 00:15:22.268]  Georgia attacked Ossetia in a sneak attack Thursday night into Friday morning.
[00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:27.431]  And then we pointed out there had been a 30 plus, 30 times build up in their military.
[00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:34.656]  Then we pointed out that they had cut the water off to Ossetia a month before and had already been taking pot shots at their police.
[00:15:34.656 --> 00:15:36.477]  Now the media is trying to spin it.
[00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:40.119]  The mainstream media has been caught lying about Russia attacking Georgia.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.881]  Premeditatedly.
[00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:42.921]  Total lie.
[00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:48.464]  And so now they're spending it saying, well, Russia did provocative things with their peacekeepers in the weeks before.
[00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:50.765]  Those peacekeepers had U.N.
[00:15:50.765 --> 00:16:02.931]  troops commanding them, watching everything they did, and ordering them, it's now come out, to not fire back at Georgians when they'd been taking potshots at them and shooting them.
[00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:03.651]  So that's a lie.
[00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:04.692]  We went into the research there.
[00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:14.331]  You know, when something breaks live at the moment, you know, it may take us 30 minutes to figure out CNN and Fox and everybody in BBC are lying.
[00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:20.095]  And then, wait a minute, it's really Georgia that's attacking Russia.
[00:16:20.095 --> 00:16:22.857]  A Russian province, basically.
[00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.118]  Enclave.
[00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:32.884]  And then it took us days to figure out that it was basically Israeli-run, predominantly, with NATO backing.
[00:16:32.884 --> 00:16:34.385]  And the world's a big, complex place.
[00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:39.479]  It's just incredibly deceptive.
[00:16:39.479 --> 00:16:42.181]  Layer after layer after layer of lies.
[00:16:42.181 --> 00:16:43.542]  Now, let's shift gears.
[00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:45.043]  This is huge news.
[00:16:45.043 --> 00:16:52.829]  I want to play this audio of, two weeks ago, John McCain saying we need an Iraq-style surge in the United States.
[00:16:52.829 --> 00:17:01.055]  And then that dovetails with the governor of Illinois saying he wants martial law and the National Guard to do gun confiscation, and they now are doing that in areas of Illinois.
[00:17:01.055 --> 00:17:04.317]  Then it dovetails with CNN reporting in a positive way.
[00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:06.488]  Like it's no big deal.
[00:17:06.488 --> 00:17:07.229]  Martial law.
[00:17:07.229 --> 00:17:09.772]  You can't leave your house even during the day.
[00:17:09.772 --> 00:17:12.054]  And we're going to play that clip for you.
[00:17:12.054 --> 00:17:13.556]  Yes, we're not joking.
[00:17:13.556 --> 00:17:14.317]  It's happening.
[00:17:14.317 --> 00:17:15.659]  Here we go.
[00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:22.887]  We know that there are some cities in America where the murder rate is gone way, way up.
[00:17:22.887 --> 00:17:24.529]  And obviously we need to do
[00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.131]  The obvious.
[00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:32.740]  We might look at what Rudy Giuliani did in New York City when he became mayor of that city.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:40.531]  He turned it into a city that really none of us were comfortable in walking through the streets to one that's basically safe.
[00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:47.656]  And, uh, some of those tactics, very frankly, you mentioned war in Iraq, are somewhat like, uh, that we use in the military.
[00:17:47.656 --> 00:18:02.487]  You go into neighborhoods, you clamp down, you provide a secure environment for the people that live there, and you, uh, make sure that the known criminals are kept under control, and you provide them with a stable environment, and then they cooperate with law enforcement.
[00:18:03.613 --> 00:18:08.794]  Okay, so, and that's what Clinton proposed when he said we're gonna have gun sweeps in the inner cities.
[00:18:08.794 --> 00:18:10.315]  They set the precedent there.
[00:18:10.315 --> 00:18:15.676]  Checkpoints from San Diego to Dallas, Texas, they just randomly shut down even nice neighborhoods.
[00:18:15.676 --> 00:18:19.617]  It's wrong to do it to poor folks, but nice areas, you just pull up, like, what's going on, officers?
[00:18:19.617 --> 00:18:21.557]  Oh, just a security check, please.
[00:18:21.557 --> 00:18:24.358]  ID, registration.
[00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:25.718]  And they just phase it in.
[00:18:25.718 --> 00:18:28.079]  They just implement it.
[00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:28.599]  And that's now
[00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:31.121]  What is beginning to unfold.
[00:18:31.121 --> 00:18:34.949]  Let's go ahead and start this clip now and we'll come back and play the rest of it after the break.
[00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:36.532]  This is In The United States.
[00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:48.996]  Because of all the recent crime in Helena, West Helena, we're talking about robberies, home invasions, loitering, shootings, the mayor of Helena, West Helena, has decided to impose a curfew, but only in certain areas.
[00:18:48.996 --> 00:18:52.878]  And that applies for everyone, no matter the age, and no matter the time.
[00:18:52.878 --> 00:18:56.880]  If you're caught violating curfew, there's a chance you could wind up behind bars.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.462]  We're afraid that somebody's going to get seriously hurt by what's going on.
[00:19:01.462 --> 00:19:02.883]  This curfew is for all people.
[00:19:03.683 --> 00:19:06.124]  Uh, everybody is subject to stop and investigation.
[00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:09.245]  It's, uh, almost akin to martial law.
[00:19:09.245 --> 00:19:11.245]  And that's exactly what some are calling it.
[00:19:11.245 --> 00:19:12.946]  For now... Stop it there.
[00:19:12.946 --> 00:19:14.226]  That was the police chief.
[00:19:14.226 --> 00:19:16.267]  We're gonna back it up and come back and play it.
[00:19:16.267 --> 00:19:19.308]  You're not allowed to leave your home during the day.
[00:19:19.308 --> 00:19:21.349]  You understand?
[00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:22.709]  Oh, it's the drug dealers.
[00:19:22.709 --> 00:19:23.489]  I looked up the numbers.
[00:19:23.489 --> 00:19:25.750]  They've had two shootings the last few months in the town.
[00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:27.855]  We're good to go.
[00:19:44.895 --> 00:19:48.699]  No matter the age, no matter the time, you don't leave your house, and it shows.
[00:19:48.699 --> 00:19:53.063]  The police are there arresting whoever they want, and they say it's totally selective.
[00:19:53.063 --> 00:19:53.744]  They decide.
[00:19:53.744 --> 00:19:55.005]  They're God.
[00:19:55.005 --> 00:19:56.987]  This is the new America.
[00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:57.667]  Bottom line.
[00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:58.108]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.545 --> 00:20:03.267]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:20:03.267 --> 00:20:03.568]  August 12, 2008.
[00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:04.349]  Gold opened at $824.90.
[00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:07.252]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $849.56, $418.65 for half ounce, and $209.33 for quarter ounce.
[00:20:07.252 --> 00:20:07.713]  That's $849.56, $418.65, and $209.33.
[00:20:18.413 --> 00:20:20.954]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[00:20:20.954 --> 00:20:22.795]  The bond market continues to slump.
[00:20:22.795 --> 00:20:23.135]  J.P.
[00:20:23.135 --> 00:20:25.956]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[00:20:25.956 --> 00:20:28.077]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[00:20:28.077 --> 00:20:32.659]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:35.060]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.501]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[00:20:39.501 --> 00:20:39.922]  The U.S.
[00:20:39.922 --> 00:20:44.083]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:45.764]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:48.747]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:51.610]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.535]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:20:55.535 --> 00:20:55.795]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:55.795 --> 00:20:55.975]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.089 --> 00:21:04.870]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:09.571]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:21:09.571 --> 00:21:14.893]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:21:14.893 --> 00:21:26.096]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:21:26.096 --> 00:21:28.477]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:21:28.877 --> 00:21:30.919]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:31.839]  Let's face it.
[00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:34.681]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:21:34.681 --> 00:21:42.687]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:21:42.687 --> 00:21:44.989]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:21:44.989 --> 00:21:48.611]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:52.174]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:21:52.174 --> 00:21:54.355]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.

[00:21:58.824 --> 00:22:00.706]  Act now.
[00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:02.768]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:22:02.768 --> 00:22:05.310]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.593]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:09.114]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:22:09.114 --> 00:22:10.816]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:22:10.816 --> 00:22:13.739]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:22:13.739 --> 00:22:17.342]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.806]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:22:35.673 --> 00:22:39.756]  How dare you?
[00:22:39.756 --> 00:22:43.339]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:22:43.339 --> 00:22:46.082]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:22:46.082 --> 00:22:52.547]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[00:23:12.352 --> 00:23:13.812]  Here is why.
[00:23:13.812 --> 00:23:23.736]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:23:24.256 --> 00:23:26.997]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:23:26.997 --> 00:23:29.117]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:30.097]  this fall?
[00:23:30.097 --> 00:23:30.997]  Don't wait.

[00:23:55.616 --> 00:23:55.917]  Act now!
[00:24:22.316 --> 00:24:25.557]  What did I tell you a decade ago?
[00:24:25.557 --> 00:24:27.758]  What did I tell you nine years ago?
[00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:29.419]  Eight years ago?
[00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:29.999]  Seven?
[00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:30.379]  Six?
[00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:30.699]  Five?
[00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:30.959]  Four?
[00:24:30.959 --> 00:24:31.240]  Three?
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:31.660]  Two?
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.501]  One?
[00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:37.722]  What did I say?
[00:24:37.722 --> 00:24:43.064]  What did I break down?
[00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.545]  How did I know?
[00:24:44.545 --> 00:24:44.885]  Because
[00:24:46.252 --> 00:24:55.417]  They have had the CIA and the Army infiltrate every major city and pay police chiefs giant suitcases full of cash.
[00:24:55.417 --> 00:24:57.578]  I have gone and interviewed the police chiefs.
[00:24:58.436 --> 00:25:02.660]  We have had an intelligence takeover operation similar to what the U.S.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:10.046]  government did in Georgia, what they did in Iraq in the 60s and 70s, what they did with our bins in Guatemala.
[00:25:10.046 --> 00:25:20.775]  They come in and for years quietly infiltrate, start finding out who's friendly in certain cities and towns, coming in with federal training, secret martial law training.
[00:25:20.775 --> 00:25:26.160]  They start coming in with cash, corrupting and compromising the police and sheriffs, okay?
[00:25:27.088 --> 00:25:36.491]  I'll never forget going to the SWAT team commander in Travis County because his guys had been basically threatening me to watch myself at County Commissioners.
[00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:42.913]  Because the county commissioners were scared of me and people that were coming down there every week when they were seizing people's children for no reason.
[00:25:42.913 --> 00:25:44.294]  And I mean no reason.
[00:25:44.294 --> 00:25:46.636]  Three tardies to class, they were grabbing them.
[00:25:46.636 --> 00:25:49.377]  And I went down there and I told them, stop your criminal activity.
[00:25:49.377 --> 00:25:53.800]  And the SWAT team guy came in there and sat down beside me and started bumping his shoulder into me.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.761]  We got video of that on the web.
[00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:57.482]  And I said, you better watch it, buddy.
[00:25:58.022 --> 00:26:11.582]  And then, they had cameras, because the SWAT team was in the building across the street, and they had, you know, dialed into the security cameras, and Lieutenant Beck, who was a nice, you know, Marine Corps veteran, Vietnam, nice fella, said, why don't you come over and talk to me?
[00:26:11.582 --> 00:26:13.164]  He wasn't playing good cop.
[00:26:13.164 --> 00:26:13.785]  He was for real.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.681]  And he said, Alex, this is all crazy.
[00:26:16.681 --> 00:26:17.882]  There's not Delta Force.
[00:26:17.882 --> 00:26:19.362]  There's not martial law.
[00:26:19.362 --> 00:26:20.683]  We all listen to your radio show.
[00:26:20.683 --> 00:26:22.624]  We got your videos.
[00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:24.345]  We've seen the Oklahoma City video.
[00:26:24.345 --> 00:26:25.486]  That's a little suspicious.
[00:26:25.486 --> 00:26:26.786]  Yeah, but we're patriots.
[00:26:26.786 --> 00:26:28.027]  None of that's going to happen.
[00:26:28.027 --> 00:26:29.908]  Just please stop screaming at the commissioners.
[00:26:29.908 --> 00:26:31.008]  It's scaring.
[00:26:31.008 --> 00:26:32.329]  And I said, you mark my words.
[00:26:32.329 --> 00:26:35.731]  You will be approached by Delta Force and the CIA within the year.
[00:26:35.731 --> 00:26:38.412]  They've already gone to at least 77 counties.
[00:26:38.412 --> 00:26:42.434]  And I started giving him the documents, the secret documents that we've gotten.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.182]  It's all on video.
[00:26:44.182 --> 00:26:50.332]  The idiot FBI gave us secret documents at a roadside checkpoint with the army instead of the ones that were for the media.
[00:26:50.332 --> 00:26:51.373]  Morons.
[00:26:51.373 --> 00:26:54.098]  But that's all in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:26:54.935 --> 00:26:57.877]  But that's the kind of stuff that slips into our hands, and he laughed at me.
[00:26:57.877 --> 00:26:59.858]  He called me six months later going, can you come by here?
[00:26:59.858 --> 00:27:01.559]  And he goes, look, Delta Force is card.
[00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:03.220]  They came by and said everything you said.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.523]  I'm not gonna tell you what else they said, but it's the same stuff that happened with the police chief in San Antonio.
[00:27:07.523 --> 00:27:09.044]  How do you know about this?
[00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:10.245]  Who do you work for?
[00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:12.547]  And I said, I work for America!
[00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:15.288]  I work for the Bill of Rights!
[00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:20.932]  This stuff all just... We just discovered all this 11 years ago.
[00:27:20.932 --> 00:27:23.554]  I was on air making fun of people about black helicopters.
[00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:26.976]  And so I told you it's going to be checkpoints.
[00:27:26.976 --> 00:27:28.880]  It's going to be police asking you questions.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.544]  I was at the shopping mall yesterday.
[00:27:30.544 --> 00:27:33.450]  I go to the shop mall about twice a year because I lost my sunglasses.
[00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.914]  They got a Ray-Ban shop in there.
[00:27:35.675 --> 00:27:48.880]  I go in there, I walk down at one Sunglass Hut, they don't have it, I go to another Sunglass Hut, I walk back by the cop, and I had this feeling, I said, he's gonna say something to me, and I just was walking, and he goes, Alex, aren't you supposed to be on the radio?
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:58.003]  And I looked at him, smiling, like it was kind of a joke, and the guy looked at me, serious, and I just said, just getting sunglasses, you know, answered his question, so I could leave in America.
[00:27:58.003 --> 00:28:00.745]  I thought the guy was joking, but he was looking at me real serious.
[00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:01.845]  I mean, this is bizarre!
[00:28:02.623 --> 00:28:05.986]  An Austin cop asking me why I'm at a shopping mall.
[00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:12.852]  The point here is, ladies and gentlemen, they tried to bribe LA Philippus with a quote, suitcase full of $100 bills.
[00:28:12.852 --> 00:28:17.976]  When he said no, they went to the sheriff, the fire chief, everybody else trying to buy them off.
[00:28:17.976 --> 00:28:20.339]  City council people took money.
[00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:23.041]  It was reported in the Associated Press.
[00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:24.502]  That is infiltration.
[00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:25.383]  That is criminal.
[00:28:27.893 --> 00:28:30.974]  And I would tell people, folks, the military is infiltrating our society.
[00:28:30.974 --> 00:28:34.175]  Then they built the emergency management centers in every town.
[00:28:34.175 --> 00:28:36.496]  Then they brought in CIA and National Guard.
[00:28:36.496 --> 00:28:52.442]  Now they bivouac National Guard in major county emergency management areas in every major county, and in rural areas in five and four and three county areas, where the National Guard, the Sheriff's Department, the Police Department, are all in one command center being federalized.
[00:28:54.947 --> 00:29:00.794]  And then, again, they announce in Illinois, oh, we're going to have the National Guard help confiscate guns, fight crime.
[00:29:00.794 --> 00:29:09.804]  They're having knock and talk from Oakland, California, to Washington, D.C., to Dallas, Texas, to Tucson, Arizona, for five years, now accelerating under federal funds.
[00:29:09.804 --> 00:29:12.988]  Hundreds of cities, they come to your door and say, do you have any legal guns?
[00:29:12.988 --> 00:29:14.229]  Mind if I come in and look at them?
[00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:16.540]  This is martial law.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.202]  This is the incremental turning martial law on.
[00:29:19.202 --> 00:29:26.809]  So I'm going to come back, play the three-minute CNN newscast, talk about it a bit, and then get Dr. Paul Greg Roberts' take on that.
[00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:31.433]  And then, of course, what's happening in Russia, then Webster-Tarpley's joining us.
[00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:34.976]  But we know what's going on, okay?
[00:29:34.976 --> 00:29:36.077]  We know what's happening.
[00:29:36.077 --> 00:29:37.698]  We have been infiltrated.
[00:29:37.698 --> 00:29:38.859]  This is criminal.
[00:29:38.859 --> 00:29:41.001]  They've done this in third-world countries over and over again.
[00:29:41.001 --> 00:29:42.302]  They've put in the
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.484]  MIT designed cameras, the tracking systems.
[00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:47.926]  This is a military grid.
[00:29:47.926 --> 00:29:51.251]  NORTHCOM is in control.
[00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:52.633]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:55.176]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.176 --> 00:29:57.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:04.280]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.581]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:09.881]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:16.783]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:30:16.783 --> 00:30:18.884]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:22.686]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:30:22.686 --> 00:30:27.468]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:30:27.468 --> 00:30:31.391]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:33.012]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:30:33.012 --> 00:30:35.693]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[00:30:43.097 --> 00:30:44.318]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:30:44.318 --> 00:30:46.799]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:48.480]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:31:08.713 --> 00:31:11.735]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:31:11.735 --> 00:31:17.479]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:21.721]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:31:21.721 --> 00:31:26.924]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.091]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:03.091 --> 00:32:10.056]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:32:10.056 --> 00:32:18.462]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:18.462 --> 00:32:24.186]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:24.346 --> 00:32:26.207]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:32:26.207 --> 00:32:28.488]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:32.910]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.132]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:32:35.132 --> 00:32:43.096]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:32:43.596 --> 00:32:43.836]  We're good.
[00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:40.384]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be with us for the next 25 minutes or so.
[00:33:40.384 --> 00:33:43.005]  Very appreciative of his time with us.
[00:33:43.005 --> 00:33:49.870]  Former Wall Street Journal editor, former head of policy, Department of Treasury, father of Reaganomics, syndicated columnist, best-selling author.
[00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:54.472]  His new book is The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[00:33:54.472 --> 00:33:57.614]  Second edition is out in better bookstores everywhere.
[00:33:57.614 --> 00:34:01.657]  But I wanted to get him on about the Russia-Georgia situation first.
[00:34:02.435 --> 00:34:09.196]  And I do have mainstream news reporting and other top military experts reporting they believe Russia did move nukes in.
[00:34:09.196 --> 00:34:11.937]  Russia has said they will use nukes if the U.S.
[00:34:11.937 --> 00:34:14.297]  hits them with even conventional weapons.
[00:34:14.297 --> 00:34:16.558]  So I want to get his take on that.
[00:34:16.558 --> 00:34:17.558]  And we're going to be playing a clip.
[00:34:17.558 --> 00:34:21.519]  But first, the Marshall Law clip from CNN.
[00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:23.419]  This is from Infowars.net.
[00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:25.020]  Steve Watson did a story on it last night.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.220]  Marshall Law declared in our Kansas town
[00:34:28.992 --> 00:34:30.032]  That's in Arkansas.
[00:34:30.032 --> 00:34:32.353]  24-hour lockdown in effect.
[00:34:32.353 --> 00:34:34.554]  Residents not allowed to leave their homes.
[00:34:34.554 --> 00:34:43.117]  Areas of the town in Arkansas have been placed under 24-hour non-stop curfew described by the mayor as almost akin to martial law.
[00:34:43.117 --> 00:34:49.379]  The lockdown issued after a spat of robberies, home invasions, and shootings applies to everyone in Helena, West Helena.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.563]  That's in the region known as Arkansas.
[00:34:53.563 --> 00:34:59.388]  No matter what age or what time of day it is, Mayor James Valley indicated that the curfew could be extended indefinitely.
[00:34:59.388 --> 00:35:13.479]  Now, this is during the day, this is during the night, everyone has stopped at checkpoints, they've had two shootings and a few rapes and quote, people loitering instead of just having real investigations and going after the criminals as society unravels.
[00:35:13.479 --> 00:35:17.402]  And of course, the economy's dead there, so there's robberies, people wanting money for food.
[00:35:18.694 --> 00:35:21.196]  Uh, well, here it is, because I'm going to get Dr. Roberts' take on this.
[00:35:21.196 --> 00:35:22.537]  He's written a lot about the police state.
[00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:23.417]  Here it is.
[00:35:23.417 --> 00:35:34.825]  Because of all the recent crime in Helena, West Helena, we're talking about robberies, home invasions, loitering, shootings, the mayor of Helena, West Helena, has decided to impose a curfew, but only in certain areas.
[00:35:34.825 --> 00:35:38.948]  And that applies for everyone, no matter the age, and no matter the times.
[00:35:38.948 --> 00:35:42.950]  If you're caught violating curfew, there's a chance you could wind up behind bars.
[00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.232]  We're afraid that somebody's going to get seriously hurt.
[00:35:45.912 --> 00:35:47.732]  You never know where a bullet is going to go.
[00:35:47.732 --> 00:35:51.013]  You never know who house is going to hit, what person is going to hit.
[00:36:15.154 --> 00:36:21.036]  And, you know, sleeping on the floor because you don't know where a bullet is gonna, you know, go to.
[00:36:21.036 --> 00:36:22.016]  It might come in my house.
[00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:23.817]  It might come in my neighbor's house.
[00:36:23.817 --> 00:36:27.418]  So I commend the hell in the west on the police department.
[00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:31.120]  But others say instead of addressing the problem... It's just gonna make it worse.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.141]  And some say instead of home sweet home, the past 24 hours... It's been like jail.
[00:36:36.545 --> 00:36:38.166]  Jails, but you can't come out your own home.
[00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:41.628]  You can't go to the store without getting stopped by the police and questioned and harassed.
[00:36:41.628 --> 00:36:48.913]  While Richard Robinson applauds the city's efforts... I think the idea is good to stop the crime, but I think the way that the police department is handling the situation is all wrong.
[00:36:48.913 --> 00:36:56.157]  When the police come by and tell you, whether you own your own property or not, that you cannot come outside, I think that's martial law and that can only be inflicted by the National Guard.
[00:36:56.157 --> 00:36:57.038]  That's my opinion on it.
[00:36:57.338 --> 00:37:03.603]  But after several rapes, robberies, and shootings, Mayor James Valley says he's exhausted all the possibilities.
[00:37:03.603 --> 00:37:08.488]  And he says this is the best move to turn around what some are calling a very rough area.
[00:37:08.488 --> 00:37:13.452]  This turf belongs to the taxpayer and citizen, not to the drug dealers and the hustlers.
[00:37:13.452 --> 00:37:15.874]  And we're going to pop them in the head.
[00:37:15.874 --> 00:37:20.578]  Yeah, we have triple the heroin, double the cocaine on our streets since the drug war began.
[00:37:20.578 --> 00:37:22.820]  Most people in prison of any nation in the world
[00:37:23.722 --> 00:37:27.786]  Uh, Mexican paramilitary troops kill cops on a weekly basis here in Texas.
[00:37:27.786 --> 00:37:29.467]  It's hardly in the news.
[00:37:29.467 --> 00:37:31.089]  Real crises go on everywhere.
[00:37:31.089 --> 00:37:35.272]  Uh, but, uh, in this town, they have checkpoints.
[00:37:35.272 --> 00:37:38.295]  You're not allowed to leave your house during the day, even be in your front yard.
[00:37:39.242 --> 00:37:40.323]  Uh, this is martial law.
[00:37:40.323 --> 00:37:42.424]  This... No nation is this tyrannical.
[00:37:42.424 --> 00:37:51.209]  No nation... I mean, even in Malaysia when they have martial law in the past, uh, it's only at night and during certain emergency times, and that's decried by the world.
[00:37:51.209 --> 00:37:55.431]  But here, the FBI's saying they want random checkpoints on the streets of America.
[00:37:55.431 --> 00:38:00.774]  Uh, the National Guard, according to NBC News, is being used for gun confiscations in Illinois, not just Chicago.
[00:38:00.774 --> 00:38:02.415]  We played that for you two weeks ago.
[00:38:02.415 --> 00:38:05.837]  Dr. Roberts, what do you think of that?
[00:38:05.837 --> 00:38:06.017]  Well...
[00:38:06.973 --> 00:38:32.469]  I don't know the whole situation there, but what this indicates to me is we see how the government in Washington could use the sort of economic dislocations that we might be headed toward, and the resulting crime that comes out of that, to impose the same thing on the entire country.
[00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:34.591]  So, I think on the whole that
[00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:41.930]  You can't give these kinds of orders to people in a free society.
[00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:57.793]  And it has to be their judge whether they're willing to take the risk to go out in the event that there's crime in the streets, or whether they need to go out for any number of legitimate reasons.
[00:38:57.793 --> 00:39:04.234]  I don't think that you can tell people that in order to make you safe, we're going to imprison you in your home.
[00:39:05.862 --> 00:39:28.048]  The notion that we're made safe by the government taking away our civil liberties, which is the Bush regime's line, or this mayor's line, that we'll make you safe by keeping everybody in their homes so the bad guys can't leave to come bother you, I don't think that this is consistent with the
[00:39:30.636 --> 00:39:33.077]  Well, they say that it's completely selectively enforced.
[00:39:33.077 --> 00:39:35.277]  They decide, they say it's day and night.
[00:39:35.277 --> 00:39:47.480]  The police arbitrarily are now God and decide if you can leave or come or go to work or do what, you know, instead of doing original police work and going after criminals, this is just turning everyone into prisoners.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:53.381]  And this is the most extreme form of martial law, saying, don't leave your house.
[00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:54.121]  This is incredible.
[00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:57.280]  Well, I agree.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.000]  It's incredible.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.583]  It's probably being applied in the areas most subject to crime and violence.
[00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:06.764]  And that's probably why it's selective.
[00:40:06.764 --> 00:40:15.828]  And to the mayor who sees a problem and doesn't know what to do with it, it might seem like, you know, a logical thing to do.
[00:40:15.828 --> 00:40:24.032]  But if he were to be guided and think a step or two further, he would see that this is not
[00:40:25.478 --> 00:40:33.062]  A good thing is not consistent with a free society, and I'm not even sure he has this type of authority.
[00:40:33.062 --> 00:40:35.403]  I don't really know if he does or not.
[00:40:35.403 --> 00:40:41.646]  But I certainly don't think it's a good development.
[00:40:41.646 --> 00:40:44.607]  Well, imagine driving through this town, what it must be like.
[00:40:44.607 --> 00:40:46.508]  But this is happening everywhere.
[00:40:46.508 --> 00:40:51.370]  You know, I reported a year and a half before it was in mainstream news that at that time
[00:40:52.205 --> 00:41:05.237]  13,000 preachers, it's now 26,000, had covertly been hired by FEMA to prepare and give sermons not telling their flock that were government written about handing guns in, going to FEMA camps, submitting to government, Romans 13.
[00:41:05.237 --> 00:41:07.779]  Now it's been in the mainstream news for the last year.
[00:41:07.779 --> 00:41:10.502]  We first broke this two years ago, two and a half years ago.
[00:41:11.364 --> 00:41:14.265]  But this is a large program going on all over the place.
[00:41:14.265 --> 00:41:18.746]  You look at PDD 51, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:41:18.746 --> 00:41:19.987]  You look at all of this.
[00:41:19.987 --> 00:41:21.747]  It states martial law.
[00:41:21.747 --> 00:41:24.288]  It states the president is basically a dictator.
[00:41:24.288 --> 00:41:27.749]  And now we have these gun knock-and-talk programs going on everywhere.
[00:41:27.749 --> 00:41:34.111]  There's no doubt this is a larger concerted atmosphere and a spirit of tyranny, Dr. Roberts.
[00:41:34.111 --> 00:41:37.112]  Well, I think I've written a lot about that and agree with you.
[00:41:37.112 --> 00:41:39.573]  I'm not sure this particular mayor is part of that.
[00:41:42.078 --> 00:41:47.283]  He may be a part of it by osmosis, just having picked up on these kinds of things.
[00:41:47.283 --> 00:41:48.444]  That's what I think.
[00:41:48.444 --> 00:41:52.327]  Yeah, but I don't think this is a federal program.
[00:41:52.327 --> 00:42:05.178]  This is some local thing where apparently times are hard and they don't know how to cope with it.
[00:42:05.178 --> 00:42:06.159]  They're making a mistake.
[00:42:08.476 --> 00:42:18.138]  You're right, the real danger is federal, because the mayor, that's local, that's a localized thing.
[00:42:18.138 --> 00:42:22.359]  When they do it nationally, it's a different kettle of fish.
[00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:24.679]  Alright, let's shift gears into Russia.
[00:42:24.679 --> 00:42:27.800]  You were last on with us Friday, you wrote a big editorial.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.040]  Sunday, you were kind enough to share a list that we read part of on air before it was even released.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.721]  Monday, more has developed, and we've now found out that the minister
[00:42:36.647 --> 00:42:42.354]  The head defense minister and the foreign minister are both former Israeli military officers and admittedly Mossad.
[00:42:42.354 --> 00:42:46.158]  The rest of the government is NATO and Ukrainian and U.S.
[00:42:46.158 --> 00:42:53.246]  It appears the only major person in their government who is Georgian is Mikheil Shevshvili.
[00:42:55.148 --> 00:42:58.449]  Well, what happened in Georgia is the National Endowment for Democracy, a neocon
[00:43:23.993 --> 00:43:36.478]  Taxpayer, American taxpayer funded organization went in there with American taxpayer's money, went into Georgia, rigged elections, barred elections, created an American puppet state.
[00:43:36.478 --> 00:43:43.041]  And this is part of the neocon strategy of encircling Russia.
[00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:53.705]  And putting buffers between Russia and the Middle East so that their influence there is precluded.
[00:43:54.973 --> 00:44:07.697]  And I'm almost certain that this attack on the south of Seychelles by the Georgians was engineered by Cheney.
[00:44:07.697 --> 00:44:18.400]  It seems to me the purpose of this is to hasten Georgia's admission into NATO.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.681]  Apparently, we wanted them in, and the European members sort of delayed it.
[00:44:23.419 --> 00:44:29.042]  So I think this is to say, look, look, the Russian aggressors, poor Georgia.
[00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:32.605]  If only they had been members of NATO, Russia never would have done this.
[00:44:32.605 --> 00:44:34.906]  I mean, I think that's what it is.
[00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:41.490]  And they want to completely capture this puppet state by sticking it in to NATO.
[00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:46.793]  And I think that's what's behind all this.
[00:44:46.793 --> 00:44:51.036]  The hypocrisy, of course, of the Bush regime is extraordinary.
[00:44:52.431 --> 00:44:54.132]  Again, lying through their teeth.
[00:44:54.132 --> 00:44:55.273]  I mean, how do we know they're lying?
[00:44:55.273 --> 00:44:56.994]  They're lips are moving, right?
[00:44:56.994 --> 00:45:15.306]  Lying through the teeth that Russia invaded, and this is not the facts, the Georgians, after giving assurances that they would never do this, just very recently, pulled off this sneak attack,
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:25.345]  Clearly, there were American forces there training the Georgians, probably directing it.
[00:45:25.345 --> 00:45:36.830]  And now we're trying to get the whole world, with our propaganda and disinformation, riled up about the Russians.
[00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:43.694]  This is another false flag operation run by the neoconservatives.
[00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:52.071]  Now, the Russians, it's very interesting, in today's Pravda online, there's an article.
[00:45:52.071 --> 00:45:55.971]  The title is, Bush, why don't you shut up?
[00:45:55.971 --> 00:46:01.072]  And then it says, I'm going to read the opening and closing paragraph.
[00:46:01.072 --> 00:46:08.594]  Taking the words of the illustrious King of Spain, in his embellished retort to President Hugo Chávez,
[00:46:10.117 --> 00:46:19.581]  We use them not as a response to a diatribe, but rather a just retort to an imbecile, President George W. Bush.
[00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:21.702]  Why don't you shut up?
[00:46:21.702 --> 00:46:24.403]  And this is now how it concludes.
[00:46:24.403 --> 00:46:27.084]  President Bush, why don't you shut up?
[00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:36.828]  Do you really think anyone gives any importance whatsoever to your words after eight years of your criminal and murderous regime and policies?
[00:46:37.867 --> 00:46:42.571]  Do you really believe you have any moral ground whatsoever?
[00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:55.682]  And do you really imagine there is a single human being anywhere on this planet who does not stick up his middle finger every time you appear on a TV screen?
[00:46:58.888 --> 00:47:06.113]  Do you really believe you have the right to give any opinion or advice after Abu Ghraib?
[00:47:06.113 --> 00:47:07.454]  After Guantanamo?
[00:47:07.454 --> 00:47:11.697]  After the massacres of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens?
[00:47:11.697 --> 00:47:16.240]  After the torture by CIA operatives?
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.181]  Kind of difficult, huh?
[00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:21.223]  So that's what the Russian press thinks of it all.
[00:47:21.223 --> 00:47:22.884]  Dr. Roberts, that was my next question.
[00:47:22.884 --> 00:47:24.205]  I have Bush's quotes here.
[00:47:25.371 --> 00:47:27.393]  And I can read them all, or I can paraphrase.
[00:47:27.393 --> 00:47:28.734]  He gave a press conference this morning.
[00:47:28.734 --> 00:47:30.395]  Everybody's probably already seen it or heard it.
[00:47:30.395 --> 00:47:31.536]  We can play the clip.
[00:47:31.536 --> 00:47:34.559]  But he said, Russia has engaged in aggression.
[00:47:34.559 --> 00:47:36.740]  They've invaded a sovereign nation.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.022]  This is criminal.
[00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.163]  This is horrible.
[00:47:40.163 --> 00:47:42.044]  What did he do in Afghanistan and Iraq?
[00:47:42.044 --> 00:47:43.185]  Right.
[00:47:43.185 --> 00:47:51.692]  And what is he preparing to do in Iran and Lebanon?
[00:47:51.692 --> 00:47:52.573]  Yeah.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.100]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:48:03.903]  The hypocrisy of the administration is astonishing, and that's what this article in today's Pravda in Moscow is pointing out.
[00:48:03.903 --> 00:48:14.266]  And you can see the total disdain for President Bush on the part of the Russian press.
[00:48:14.266 --> 00:48:16.507]  Now, what I think is that
[00:48:20.405 --> 00:48:39.496]  The Russians, being far more reasonable people than the Bush administration, may be suckered in by the European members of NATO into ending this and pulling out.
[00:48:39.496 --> 00:48:42.117]  In which case, the Russians will be further betrayed.
[00:48:42.117 --> 00:48:49.061]  The next step will be to put Georgia into NATO and then station NATO troops there.
[00:48:50.586 --> 00:48:58.191]  And then they will ethnically cleanse the Russians out of the two disputed provinces.
[00:48:58.191 --> 00:49:07.978]  Just as they did whenever they brought in the Muslims to attack the Serbs in Kosovo, then they took it, then they said, don't worry, we're not going to break it off, and they did that last year.
[00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:08.999]  Right, right.
[00:49:08.999 --> 00:49:19.186]  Now you see, Americans being basically unaware and gullible people, my understanding is that this disputed area
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:20.681]  I think so.
[00:49:34.235 --> 00:49:36.838]  Because he was from central Georgia.
[00:49:36.838 --> 00:49:38.299]  He was from Georgia, yeah.
[00:49:38.299 --> 00:49:41.582]  He was from Georgia, and speaking of the devil, he was the editor of Pravda.
[00:49:41.582 --> 00:49:48.227]  Exactly, and at the time, Georgia was part of the Soviet Union and actually had been part of the Russian Empire for centuries.
[00:49:48.227 --> 00:49:51.910]  Yes, Abkhazia and Ossetia have always been part of Russia.
[00:49:51.910 --> 00:50:00.478]  Yeah, and so it was the Georgian Stalin who became dictator of the Soviet Union in the 20th century.
[00:50:01.508 --> 00:50:18.821]  He broke off a piece of the Russian Republic of Ossetia and stuck it into Georgia, and I think he may have also taken that other disputed part on the west part of Georgia that has Black Sea.
[00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:19.221]  No, he did.
[00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:19.561]  You're right.
[00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:21.222]  I saw that in the history books, Jim.
[00:50:21.222 --> 00:50:28.708]  So, if that's the case, then these are historic... In fact, apparently the people in these places are largely Russian.
[00:50:29.816 --> 00:50:32.318]  And apparently you would have Russian passports.
[00:50:32.318 --> 00:50:33.279]  90 plus percent.
[00:50:33.279 --> 00:50:35.161]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:50:35.161 --> 00:50:39.685]  And they were snuck attacked by the Georgians, U.S.
[00:50:39.685 --> 00:50:40.606]  backed.
[00:50:40.606 --> 00:50:50.574]  And when we come back, I want to get your take on the Israeli connection here with their defense minister of Georgia and their foreign minister being openly Israelis, not even Georgians.
[00:50:50.574 --> 00:50:52.636]  Stay with us, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:50:52.636 --> 00:50:56.319]  We'll also talk about the nukes that Russia reportedly moved in when we get back.
[00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:56.780]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.078 --> 00:51:02.039]  Hey, Clyde!
[00:51:02.039 --> 00:51:03.040]  What's up, Bonnie?
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.503]  Well, I got a question about those shielded, secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[00:51:07.503 --> 00:51:12.247]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID chips.
[00:51:12.247 --> 00:51:13.048]  What about them?
[00:51:13.048 --> 00:51:17.492]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends, and they want info on purchasing the secure sleeves.
[00:51:17.492 --> 00:51:18.513]  Oh, Bonnie!
[00:51:18.513 --> 00:51:25.018]  If everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve, it'll destroy our plan to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader.
[00:51:25.018 --> 00:51:26.760]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.321]  They promised not to tell anyone else.
[00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:29.662]  I guess you're right.
[00:51:29.662 --> 00:51:31.464]  That's what friends are for, I suppose.
[00:51:31.464 --> 00:51:37.249]  Tell them they can get a five-pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's licenses for $19.95.
[00:51:37.249 --> 00:51:42.614]  And Identity Stronghold also has a three-pack of secure sleeves for passport books for $14.95.
[00:51:42.614 --> 00:51:43.995]  And where do they buy them?
[00:51:43.995 --> 00:51:48.158]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form at IDStronghold.com.
[00:51:48.158 --> 00:51:50.340]  IDStronghold.com.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.782]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the Internet?
[00:51:52.262 --> 00:51:53.043]  They can call 1-800-610-2770.
[00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:55.886]  That's 800-610-2770.
[00:51:55.886 --> 00:52:00.490]  Thanks, Clyde.
[00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:01.771]  Why should we fire Congress?
[00:52:01.771 --> 00:52:05.394]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[00:52:05.394 --> 00:52:07.697]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[00:52:07.697 --> 00:52:10.519]  That was their employment document.
[00:52:10.519 --> 00:52:11.580]  They haven't followed it.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.282]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[00:52:13.462 --> 00:52:15.344]  Washington, you're fired!
[00:52:15.344 --> 00:52:16.865]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[00:52:32.659 --> 00:52:32.839]  I'm good.
[00:53:00.857 --> 00:53:06.581]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:53:06.581 --> 00:53:07.882]  And we knew what to do.
[00:53:07.882 --> 00:53:09.903]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:53:09.903 --> 00:53:16.928]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:53:16.928 --> 00:53:22.092]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:25.830]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:32.934]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:53:32.934 --> 00:53:36.095]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:53:36.095 --> 00:53:41.878]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:53:41.878 --> 00:53:44.439]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:53:44.939 --> 00:53:51.004]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:53:51.004 --> 00:53:53.926]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:53:53.926 --> 00:53:58.810]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:54:12.095 --> 00:54:15.439]  His best-selling book is now out in the second edition, massively expanded.
[00:54:15.439 --> 00:54:22.125]  You want to understand the police state, the structure of rule of law, the court system, and much more?
[00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:26.730]  You want to get his book, The Tyranny of Good Intentions, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:30.213]  You can go to Counterpunch and so many other countless sites.
[00:54:30.879 --> 00:54:34.040]  As well as newspapers that carry his weekly editorials.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.581]  He is our guest for this segment and the next, and Webster Tarpley joins us.
[00:54:38.581 --> 00:54:50.044]  Shifting gears on the Russian subject into nukes, there was a major report, well there was a whole bunch of different reports that were
[00:54:51.627 --> 00:55:01.694]  In the Russian press, too many to mention, we have some of those clips we're going to play later with Tarpley, but Colonel Sam Gardner, highly respected weapons expert and Air Force tactics expert, if the U.S.
[00:55:01.694 --> 00:55:04.016]  attacks Russia, Russell will use nuclear weapons.
[00:55:04.016 --> 00:55:05.777]  This is him on Democracy Now!
[00:55:05.777 --> 00:55:11.441]  Last night, I want to play a couple minutes of this, where she's asking him, could this lead to World War III?
[00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:16.204]  Now, the neocons have been saying that, Crystal's been saying how great it is, and let's have a confrontation with him.
[00:55:16.204 --> 00:55:19.827]  Here he is talking about how they clearly moved in two nuclear-tipped missiles.
[00:55:19.827 --> 00:55:20.147]  Here it is.
[00:55:20.763 --> 00:55:24.984]  Do we have anything to fear along those lines?
[00:55:24.984 --> 00:55:26.625]  Absolutely.
[00:55:26.625 --> 00:55:42.429]  Let me just say that if you were to rate how serious the strategic situations have been in the past few years, this would be above Iraq, this would be above Afghanistan, and this would be above Iran.
[00:55:45.044 --> 00:56:04.817]  On little notice to Americans, the Russians learned at the end of the First Gulf War that they didn't think they could deal with the United States given the value and the quality of American precision conventional weapons.
[00:56:04.817 --> 00:56:05.998]  The Russians put in
[00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.271]  We're good to go.
[00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.031]  We're good to go!
[00:56:43.971 --> 00:56:50.140]  Okay, stop right there.
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:56.129]  Now, again, she asked the question, we started the clip a bit late, she asked the question, is there a threat of nuclear war?
[00:56:56.129 --> 00:56:57.391]  We've seen that in some Russian press.
[00:56:58.306 --> 00:57:07.111]  And then he says yes, and then he talks about how they did move in nuclear-tipped missiles, clearly from intelligence, because they weren't for conventional use.
[00:57:07.111 --> 00:57:13.295]  It was only two that had the configuration to be tactical smaller nukes.
[00:57:13.295 --> 00:57:15.156]  And then he talks about the U.S.
[00:57:15.156 --> 00:57:21.800]  didn't expect this and basically backed off, and that they didn't think Russia would do this because they handed over Kosovo.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.042]  Dr. Roberts?
[00:57:24.042 --> 00:57:26.043]  Yeah, well, I don't know.
[00:57:26.906 --> 00:57:31.450]  About the nuclear weapons use.
[00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:44.399]  I don't think the Russians would need that in Georgia because the United States is not capable of sending enough troops to Georgia to confront the Russian army.
[00:57:44.399 --> 00:57:47.081]  First of all, we don't have any troops.
[00:57:47.081 --> 00:57:50.164]  They're all mired down in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:57:51.269 --> 00:57:59.892]  And second, we would have enormous supply problems that the Russians wouldn't have, since it's their borders.
[00:57:59.892 --> 00:58:03.214]  I think he was talking about air attacks out of NATO bases.
[00:58:03.214 --> 00:58:11.077]  Well, if we attack Russia, I think Russia will go instantly on full nuclear alert.
[00:58:11.077 --> 00:58:15.078]  We won't be worried about tacular nukes in Georgia.
[00:58:15.078 --> 00:58:19.140]  We'll have to be worried about New York and Boston and Washington and L.A.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:19.660]  and Chicago.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:26.584]  And if the United States government is this insane, then they need to be dragged out quickly.
[00:58:26.584 --> 00:58:35.430]  But we have to just drag them out of their offices and get rid of them, because if they're actually going to attack Russia, then they're going to bring on the end of the world.
[00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.951]  Well, stay there.
[00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:42.575]  I want to hear his William Chryslers running around saying, do just that.
[00:58:42.575 --> 00:58:43.996]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.996 --> 00:58:46.458]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.862]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:55.666]  A new world order.
[00:58:55.666 --> 00:59:00.572]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:59:00.572 --> 00:59:03.396]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:59:03.396 --> 00:59:06.180]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.583]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:09.355 --> 00:59:19.729]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:19.729 --> 00:59:24.655]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:25.175 --> 00:59:29.018]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:29.018 --> 00:59:31.580]  Build-a-Burg is making great progress in the New World Order.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.740]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:33.541]  They're not after money.
[00:59:33.541 --> 00:59:34.822]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:34.822 --> 00:59:35.802]  They're after power.
[00:59:35.802 --> 00:59:36.943]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:59:53.684 --> 00:59:56.066]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.066 --> 00:59:58.829]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:10.280]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.861]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.861 --> 01:00:12.782]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.782 --> 01:00:17.605]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.605 --> 01:00:21.869]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:23.230]  We've only got five minutes left.
[01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:30.715]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, very thankful for him joining us today with his analysis of what's happening.
[01:00:30.715 --> 01:00:33.297]  In closing, Dr. Roberts, two final questions.
[01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:42.655]  Why are the Neocons, Fife and all of these guys, Crystal, running around saying, you know, encircle Russia?
[01:00:42.655 --> 01:00:47.920]  Cheney called him and said there will be a response to this and basically threatened their president Sunday.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.581]  That was in the Associated Press.
[01:00:49.581 --> 01:00:52.904]  His quotes were incredibly incendiary.
[01:00:52.904 --> 01:00:56.367]  They've launched a sneak attack on him and now they're acting like Russia caused all this.
[01:00:57.516 --> 01:01:01.219]  Well, I think probably we've scared our NATO allies to death if we're actually
[01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:29.554]  Uh, issuing these kinds of threats to, uh, a nuclear power who hasn't done anything except try to get along with us.
[01:01:29.554 --> 01:01:41.762]  Uh, so it may be, uh, unless we have actually, uh, purchased and blackmailed all the leaders of, uh, of the European countries, it may be, mean that they don't want to be in NATO.
[01:01:41.762 --> 01:01:45.564]  It's too dangerous because it's run by insane people in Washington.
[01:01:45.564 --> 01:01:47.625]  That could be one fallout.
[01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:49.006]  Um, the other fallout will
[01:01:49.713 --> 01:01:53.575]  It'll have to certainly wake up the Russians.
[01:01:53.575 --> 01:01:57.157]  They're trying to get along with us and cooperate with us.
[01:01:57.157 --> 01:02:00.959]  It just means they get stabbed in the back repeatedly.
[01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:10.925]  And so I would imagine we'll see a more aggressive stance on the part of the Russians.
[01:02:10.925 --> 01:02:16.248]  And since all of our European NATO allies are dependent on Russia for natural gas,
[01:02:17.322 --> 01:02:28.745]  They've got probably as much leverage over allies as we do through blackmail and illegal payments to foreign, to European leaders.
[01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:41.208]  So, I think that because they are insane, the neoconservatives and Cheney, and because Bush is an imbecile, like Pravda says, an imbecile,
[01:02:42.695 --> 01:02:52.722]  We are in risk of enormous, horrendous events that could potentially end life on Earth.
[01:02:52.722 --> 01:02:56.224]  You call it the reign of the cockroach.
[01:02:56.224 --> 01:02:57.105]  That's right.
[01:02:57.105 --> 01:03:01.428]  That's what I called it when I wrote about it some time back.
[01:03:01.428 --> 01:03:07.492]  I think that the American people have been just completely irresponsible.
[01:03:09.565 --> 01:03:17.630]  They've let this criminal regime get in office and stay there for essentially eight years.
[01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:24.093]  Run Russia over their rights, their liberties, the Constitution, and other countries.
[01:03:24.093 --> 01:03:28.435]  I mean, Bush has destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:03:28.435 --> 01:03:30.176]  The infrastructure is everything.
[01:03:30.176 --> 01:03:32.258]  Well, I was in a... There's no other people.
[01:03:32.258 --> 01:03:36.780]  These are the greatest crimes the world has seen.
[01:03:38.783 --> 01:03:42.306]  It's an amazing criminal regime.
[01:03:42.306 --> 01:03:44.487]  And every time they open their mouth, they lie.
[01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:47.849]  We now have all the evidence of the lies everywhere.
[01:03:47.849 --> 01:03:57.836]  So I think they seem to be determined to propel us into some sort of major conflict.
[01:03:57.836 --> 01:03:58.917]  Well, it's like PENAC said.
[01:03:58.917 --> 01:03:59.837]  We have the power.
[01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:03.400]  We're going to use it.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.201]  Yeah, but, you know, like you and I, I think Gree,
[01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:11.832]  The estimates of the power they have is greatly exaggerated.
[01:04:11.832 --> 01:04:15.933]  The United States just doesn't have the power that these people think it's got.
[01:04:15.933 --> 01:04:19.013]  Except for nukes, which they're menacing everyone with.
[01:04:19.013 --> 01:04:20.694]  Yeah, but the Russians have nukes.
[01:04:20.694 --> 01:04:21.774]  The Chinese have nukes.
[01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:22.654]  I know, it's insane!
[01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:28.396]  Pakistanis have nukes.
[01:04:28.396 --> 01:04:33.757]  What you have told me on this program about these behaviors is really frightening.
[01:04:36.085 --> 01:04:42.129]  What our so-called leaders are doing and saying is they're clearly insane.
[01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:43.009]  Clearly insane.
[01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:44.110]  They've all been saying it.
[01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:46.391]  Well, as this develops, we'll talk to you again, Dr. Roberts.
[01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:48.092]  Thank you for all your time.
[01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:48.953]  All right, Alex.
[01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:49.954]  Good luck to you.
[01:04:49.954 --> 01:04:50.654]  You too, my friend.
[01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:51.414]  Say hi to your family.
[01:04:51.414 --> 01:04:53.996]  Okay, we'll be right back with Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[01:04:53.996 --> 01:04:54.797]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:54.797 --> 01:04:58.079]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:04:58.079 --> 01:05:00.220]  My new film, Truth Rising, is now available on DVD.
[01:05:01.573 --> 01:05:04.576]  Hey everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[01:05:04.576 --> 01:05:19.969]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna, I love beef stroganoff, I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts, all kinds of entrees and soups and desserts and breakfasts.
[01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:21.070]  I love that stuff.
[01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:24.493]  Now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[01:05:24.713 --> 01:05:28.254]  I mean the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[01:05:28.254 --> 01:05:30.495]  Grocery prices are right on their heels.
[01:05:30.495 --> 01:05:32.136]  How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[01:05:32.136 --> 01:05:38.918]  Well I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price of last year's grocery bill.
[01:05:38.918 --> 01:05:44.060]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year, I can have it delivered to your door!

[01:07:00.693 --> 01:07:02.835]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:07:02.835 --> 01:07:05.277]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:07:05.277 --> 01:07:07.538]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:07:07.538 --> 01:07:09.099]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:07:09.099 --> 01:07:10.781]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:13.703]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:07:13.703 --> 01:07:17.325]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:07:26.974 --> 01:07:31.833]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.633]  An inside job?
[01:07:35.633 --> 01:07:39.714]  How dare you?
[01:07:39.714 --> 01:07:43.315]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:07:43.315 --> 01:07:46.055]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:07:46.055 --> 01:07:52.537]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:07:52.537 --> 01:07:55.358]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:07:55.358 --> 01:07:57.618]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:07:57.618 --> 01:08:00.099]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:08:08.399 --> 01:08:11.580]  America is now under martial law.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:17.601]  All constitutional rights have been suspended.
[01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:19.742]  Stay in your homes.
[01:08:19.742 --> 01:08:26.563]  Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.
[01:08:26.563 --> 01:08:28.324]  Shut up!
[01:08:28.324 --> 01:08:33.945]  Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.
[01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:46.994]  Anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew will be shot.
[01:08:46.994 --> 01:08:49.356]  Remain calm.
[01:08:49.356 --> 01:08:51.697]  Do not panic.
[01:08:51.697 --> 01:09:02.623]  Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.
[01:09:02.623 --> 01:09:07.286]  Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples
[01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:13.310]  Stay in your home.
[01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.453]  Remain calm.
[01:09:15.453 --> 01:09:20.499]  The number one enemy of progress is question.
[01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:26.306]  National security is more important than individual will.
[01:09:26.306 --> 01:09:29.490]  All sports broadcasts will
[01:09:32.293 --> 01:09:38.139]  No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission.
[01:09:38.139 --> 01:09:44.064]  Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor.
[01:09:44.064 --> 01:09:45.586]  Shut up!
[01:09:45.586 --> 01:09:46.767]  Be happy.
[01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:49.609]  Obey all orders without question.
[01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:52.392]  The comfort you've demanded is now mandatory.
[01:09:52.392 --> 01:09:52.752]  Be happy.
[01:09:55.649 --> 01:10:01.533]  Now, in England and many areas of the U.S., you're not allowed more than groups of two to three people to gather.
[01:10:01.533 --> 01:10:03.834]  Martial law is incrementally being put into place.
[01:10:03.834 --> 01:10:06.215]  Most of your local departments have been covertly federalized.
[01:10:06.215 --> 01:10:07.876]  Your police have been corrupted.
[01:10:07.876 --> 01:10:09.677]  Your police chiefs have been covertly paid off.
[01:10:09.677 --> 01:10:14.240]  A few have gone public and talked about the attempted bribery by CIA, Army, Delta Force.
[01:10:16.152 --> 01:10:19.094]  And I just wanted to briefly play the first part of this CNN piece again.
[01:10:19.094 --> 01:10:21.456]  We're in a town, and guaranteed it is federal, folks.
[01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:24.037]  This is where they're getting the ideas, where they're getting the training.
[01:10:24.037 --> 01:10:27.600]  Oh, there's been a few shootings, so don't leave your house even during the day.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.101]  Don't even be in your yard!
[01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:36.586]  Forget what Jell-O the Opera joked about, you know, 15 years ago about, uh, don't, uh, leave your subdivision sectors.
[01:10:36.586 --> 01:10:37.586]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:10:37.586 --> 01:10:41.689]  And of course, under Homeland Security, it is Neighborhood Watch spying on you, watching you.
[01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:42.370]  Uh, so here it is.
[01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:54.740]  Because of all the recent crime in Helena, West Helena, we're talking about robberies, home invasions, loitering, shootings, the mayor of Helena, West Helena, has decided to impose a curfew, but only in certain areas.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:58.644]  And that applies for everyone, no matter the age, and no matter the time.
[01:10:58.644 --> 01:11:02.768]  If you're caught violating curfew, there's a chance you could wind up behind bars.
[01:11:02.768 --> 01:11:07.252]  We're afraid that somebody's going to get seriously hurt by what's going on.
[01:11:07.252 --> 01:11:08.653]  This curfew is for all people.
[01:11:09.393 --> 01:11:11.874]  Uh, everybody is subject to stop and investigation.
[01:11:11.874 --> 01:11:14.994]  It's, uh, almost akin to martial law.
[01:11:14.994 --> 01:11:17.014]  And that's exactly what some are calling it.
[01:11:17.014 --> 01:11:21.715]  For now, 2nd Street and several streets surrounding it will look just like this.
[01:11:21.715 --> 01:11:26.396]  And if you're caught outside without a good enough excuse... Zero tolerance, they're going to jail.
[01:11:26.396 --> 01:11:28.656]  An idea that's fined by Martha Coleman.
[01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:30.877]  You never know where a bullet is gonna go.
[01:11:30.877 --> 01:11:31.597]  Alright, there we go.
[01:11:31.597 --> 01:11:32.637]  Stop it there.
[01:11:32.637 --> 01:11:37.218]  Now, where a bullet's gonna go, like these magic bullets are flying around like the Kennedy assassination,
[01:11:37.947 --> 01:11:38.387]  I looked it up.
[01:11:38.387 --> 01:11:40.868]  There's been a couple murders the last few months there.
[01:11:40.868 --> 01:11:42.108]  Drug dealers shooting each other.
[01:11:42.108 --> 01:11:45.770]  The government ships in the drugs to create the crisis to begin with.
[01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:51.192]  And they will selectively, day or night, decide if you're allowed to be out or you'll be taken into the FEMA camp.
[01:11:51.192 --> 01:11:54.693]  And they train your children going back for a decade how to load on the bus during a FEMA drill.
[01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:56.253]  They don't tell the parents about it.
[01:11:56.253 --> 01:12:01.495]  They make them defecate staying in the classroom for eight hours in trash cans in front of everyone.
[01:12:01.495 --> 01:12:05.976]  No lunch is given to them under federal grants to quote teach them what martial law is like.
[01:12:05.976 --> 01:12:06.077]  In 1998,
[01:12:07.817 --> 01:12:09.439]  Swansboro happened up there.
[01:12:09.439 --> 01:12:13.282]  It also happened in Hobbs Middle School in Pensacola.
[01:12:13.282 --> 01:12:14.043]  That happened in 98.
[01:12:14.043 --> 01:12:22.631]  The Marines came in and said, put the kids against the wall with guns, wouldn't let them have food all day, and said, the federal government wants you to know what martial law is like.
[01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:23.792]  And I've got those articles.
[01:12:23.792 --> 01:12:25.274]  I, of course, covered that back in 1998.
[01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:28.517]  This is going on everywhere.
[01:12:28.517 --> 01:12:31.800]  And it's incrementally training you how to live in a total police state.
[01:12:33.386 --> 01:12:36.747]  I was asked by an Austin police officer what I was doing in the mall yesterday.
[01:12:36.747 --> 01:12:39.868]  He walked over and said, Alex, what are you doing there?
[01:12:39.868 --> 01:12:40.908]  You're supposed to be on the radio.
[01:12:40.908 --> 01:12:41.688]  And I thought he was joking.
[01:12:41.688 --> 01:12:42.248]  I smiled at him.
[01:12:42.248 --> 01:12:45.509]  He kind of looked at me like, what are you doing here?
[01:12:45.509 --> 01:12:48.490]  And I said, I'm buying a pair of sunglasses.
[01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.330]  So that's America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:54.371]  That's what things have turned into in this country.
[01:12:54.992 --> 01:13:02.619]  And they've built the FEMA emergency management centers, the fusion centers, the local emergency centers are really federal, moving the National Guard into them.
[01:13:02.619 --> 01:13:06.143]  This is the last decade plus, a long, covert operation.
[01:13:06.866 --> 01:13:08.707]  Doesn't matter what administration's in.
[01:13:08.707 --> 01:13:10.748]  They use the neocons as fronts.
[01:13:10.748 --> 01:13:14.850]  There's a darker military-industrial complex owned by the private banks above us.
[01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:18.532]  For the next hour and 45 minutes, we're joined by Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[01:13:18.532 --> 01:13:22.455]  I wanted to get his take on what happened in Russia and Georgia.
[01:13:22.455 --> 01:13:25.877]  I wanted to get his analysis of the ongoing political campaign.
[01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:28.278]  Now it looks like Hillary's going to be the running mate of Barack Obama.
[01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:28.898]  How can that be?
[01:13:28.898 --> 01:13:30.039]  The woman in shining armor.
[01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:32.821]  With the evil Barack Obama.
[01:13:32.821 --> 01:13:34.161]  It's all stage, folks.
[01:13:34.161 --> 01:13:35.963]  And I also want to get his take on the martial law.
[01:13:35.963 --> 01:13:44.648]  In fact, let's talk about this gearing up into the police state, this martial law being incrementally accelerated and ratcheted up here in the U.S.
[01:13:44.648 --> 01:13:45.949]  Webster, good to have you on.
[01:13:45.949 --> 01:13:46.549]  Hello, Alex.
[01:13:46.549 --> 01:13:47.330]  How are you?
[01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.750]  You bet.
[01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:48.170]  I should have.
[01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:52.333]  We're also carrying your new book, Obama, the Postmodern Coup.
[01:13:52.333 --> 01:13:53.473]  We have a few left.
[01:13:53.473 --> 01:13:54.794]  The first edition is almost sold out.
[01:13:54.794 --> 01:13:55.815]  The second is about to come out.
[01:13:56.415 --> 01:13:58.136]  We have it available at InfoWars.com.
[01:13:58.136 --> 01:14:09.340]  Webster, first, what you heard CNN, you know, it's not just the point of the martial law in the town, but the fact that they're just announcing it like it's a good thing and normal on national news.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:15.102]  I would recommend that we supplement awareness of everything that you've said, which of course is real and valid.
[01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:23.978]  With another dimension, which is not the top-down, police-state, dictatorial, totalitarian dimension, but the fascist dimension.
[01:14:23.978 --> 01:14:25.660]  And this is fundamentally different.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:32.806]  This is a grassroots, anti-authoritarian movement of goons, thugs, hooligans,
[01:14:33.567 --> 01:14:38.253]  And fervently idealistic students, a lot of them left liberals.
[01:14:38.253 --> 01:14:45.684]  Lemmings, zombies, Kool-Aid drinkers, Manson cultists, Hari Krishnas, whatever you want to call it.
[01:14:45.684 --> 01:14:47.046]  That is the Obama campaign.
[01:14:48.807 --> 01:15:00.633]  The history of fascism indicates that a point is reached where the army, well first of all where the police, are not enough to quell a mass upsurge.
[01:15:00.633 --> 01:15:08.797]  The army cannot be relied on because the history of rulers is that you send in a division and it goes over to the revolutionary side.
[01:15:08.797 --> 01:15:16.441]  And you've got to bring in the youth brigade, you've got to give the petty masses petty power, and that's exactly, but my point is is that
[01:15:17.156 --> 01:15:18.296]  We can blame this on Obama.
[01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:20.037]  I'm not saying he's good, Webster.
[01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:28.479]  The point is, going back at least 25 years, they've had a slow creep into getting citizens involved in the Tattletale squads, into the enforcement squads.
[01:15:28.479 --> 01:15:34.300]  Now they're co-opting the environmental movement to be their enforcement squads.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.200]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:42.482]  My point is, you're saying Obama, Obama, and I agree he's the figurehead for a very virulent form of this, but
[01:15:43.866 --> 01:15:49.609]  You know, going back to George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, they've been setting up... McCain's called for youth brigades now.
[01:15:49.609 --> 01:15:50.790]  Go ahead.
[01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:59.554]  I would just say that Obama is, if you look at the political landscape, there's only one political figure with a mass-based fascist movement.
[01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:00.595]  And that's Obama.
[01:16:00.595 --> 01:16:02.196]  McCain doesn't have one.
[01:16:02.196 --> 01:16:03.036]  Bush doesn't have one.
[01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:03.636]  It's a joke.
[01:16:03.636 --> 01:16:05.097]  Clinton doesn't have one.
[01:16:05.097 --> 01:16:06.338]  No other Democrat has one.
[01:16:06.838 --> 01:16:10.923]  I've just spent the weekend at the Puma Convention here in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:10.923 --> 01:16:23.597]  This is the anti-Obama Democrats, and I think this is an extremely useful thing to fight Obama up to the time of the convention, to try to stop him at the convention, and if he gets the Democratic nomination, then to defeat him.
[01:16:23.597 --> 01:16:26.160]  I think this is a real distinction.
[01:16:26.587 --> 01:16:38.654]  History shows that there's a huge difference between just another bourgeois politician, no matter how bellicose, no matter how oppressive, no matter how corrupt, and something that gets you into fascism.
[01:16:38.654 --> 01:16:43.017]  With Obama, you've got something like a Green Corps.
[01:16:43.017 --> 01:16:45.238]  You've got a Homeland Security Corps.
[01:16:45.838 --> 01:16:49.023]  And you've got Al Gore's famous Green Army.
[01:16:49.023 --> 01:16:54.451]  So the difference is one way the FBI comes and harasses you or the kinds of things you were talking about.
[01:16:54.451 --> 01:17:00.839]  The other side is a gang of goons and thugs come and burn you out and kill you or lynch you or whatever it is.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:13.893]  And the idea is that the police state gets popular cover, anti-authoritarian or even left or radical cover out of the fact that you've got these Obama bots that are in action.
[01:17:13.893 --> 01:17:20.380]  I heard stories from people who had been in the Texas Democratic Caucuses as well as the Iowa ones.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:32.124]  The way that Obama won those caucuses is with intimidation, with threats, with locking the doors, with pushing people, beating them up in some cases, threatening to beat them up.
[01:17:32.124 --> 01:17:37.886]  And when you go to the Internet, people who have been blogging against Obama report that they are getting
[01:17:38.486 --> 01:17:44.968]  Massive cyber warfare, denial of service attacks, attempts to overwhelm their cell phones, and so on down the line.
[01:17:44.968 --> 01:17:53.831]  And then in Germany, they ordered the Germans to not allow any signs, pro or con, and the police did beat up people with signs that are under Obama's orders.
[01:17:53.831 --> 01:17:56.511]  Yes, right, and it's just amazing.
[01:17:56.511 --> 01:18:00.753]  So, I would say, you basically have two classes of politicians.
[01:18:00.753 --> 01:18:04.734]  You have the old style ones, however bad they are, of course they're very bad as you're pointing out.
[01:18:05.274 --> 01:18:08.518]  But the Bushes, the McCains, the Clintons, that's one thing.
[01:18:08.518 --> 01:18:09.639]  That's bad enough.
[01:18:09.639 --> 01:18:22.354]  But then when you get into the area of this scurrilous, gutter snipe, thug goon, and fervently idealistic student, swarming adolescent, rent-a-mob, dupa-mob,
[01:18:22.834 --> 01:18:25.197]  Then you've crossed a qualitative dividing line.
[01:18:25.197 --> 01:18:45.898]  The people who lived in Italy in 1922, or Germany in 1933, kept saying, gee, we thought we were under fascism, but now we realize we weren't, and now we are, and this has been a tremendous deterioration, and now it's too late to roll it back, because the genius of fascism, of course, is that it goes out and destroys the institutions that might resist
[01:18:46.338 --> 01:18:47.439]  The things that you're talking about.
[01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:52.462]  So far, not that many institutions have been crushed by the measures that you're talking about.
[01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:54.783]  But with Obama in the Green Corps, that will begin.
[01:18:54.783 --> 01:18:58.245]  Well, I'm sure I have to say, the mainstream media, the corporates, have been behind him.
[01:18:58.245 --> 01:19:00.827]  So that's the big strike against him.
[01:19:00.827 --> 01:19:10.553]  And you are right in saying that he's the only one that gives any support to the government and the corrupt system.
[01:19:10.553 --> 01:19:14.015]  And I've heard mainstream pundits say that
[01:19:14.838 --> 01:19:21.403]  We need Obama to bring people back into government, back into trusting the state, into infusing it with new blood.
[01:19:21.403 --> 01:19:24.506]  And so he would give a new lease on life to the New World Order.
[01:19:24.506 --> 01:19:31.992]  They also say that right now they complain that Andrew Sullivan complained in the Atlantic Magazine last December in an issue with Obama on the cover.
[01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:33.353]  And then the White House said...
[01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:55.894]  That Obama will be tested by, quote, an attack, then he can pose as a savior when we're hit by a nuke or a bioweapon, and then be our new dictator.
[01:19:55.894 --> 01:19:59.356]  And after all, he's black, so blacks can do no wrong.
[01:19:59.356 --> 01:20:00.377]  Everything's gonna be fine.
[01:20:00.377 --> 01:20:01.377]  Webster Tarbley, stay there.
[01:20:01.377 --> 01:20:04.239]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:20:04.239 --> 01:20:05.800]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.941]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:20:07.941 --> 01:20:09.582]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:09.822 --> 01:20:10.462]  We're good to go.
[01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:39.838]  We're good to go.
[01:21:01.309 --> 01:21:05.072]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:05.072 --> 01:21:10.095]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:10.095 --> 01:21:15.579]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:26.567]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:26.567 --> 01:21:27.788]  They are called Illuminati.
[01:21:28.168 --> 01:21:29.109]  We're good to go.

[01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.295]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:53.295 --> 01:22:53.655]  August 12, 2008.
[01:22:53.655 --> 01:22:54.395]  Gold opened at $824.90.
[01:22:54.395 --> 01:22:57.517]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $849.56, $418.65 for half ounce, and $209.33 for quarter ounce.
[01:22:57.517 --> 01:22:58.037]  That's $849.56, $418.65, and $209.33.
[01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:19.811]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:21.651]  The bond market continues to slump.
[01:23:21.651 --> 01:23:21.991]  J.P.
[01:23:21.991 --> 01:23:24.812]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:23:24.812 --> 01:23:26.933]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:23:26.933 --> 01:23:31.514]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:23:31.514 --> 01:23:33.915]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:23:33.915 --> 01:23:38.356]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:23:38.356 --> 01:23:38.776]  The U.S.
[01:23:38.776 --> 01:23:42.937]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:23:42.937 --> 01:23:44.618]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:23:45.038 --> 01:23:47.599]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[01:23:47.599 --> 01:23:49.099]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:23:49.099 --> 01:23:54.401]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:23:54.401 --> 01:23:54.641]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:54.641 --> 01:23:54.881]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:54.881 --> 01:23:55.862]  He's going the distance!
[01:23:55.862 --> 01:23:56.682]  He's going for speed!
[01:24:27.635 --> 01:24:29.737]  All right Webster, let's keep going with Obama.
[01:24:29.737 --> 01:24:47.775]  I want to break down what elite is behind him, but I really want to get your expertise because you know a lot about Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, but what we just saw in the last five days with the sneak attack by the Georgians, backed by NATO, the US, and the Israelis,
[01:24:48.704 --> 01:24:50.405]  I really doubt she'll be his running mate.
[01:24:50.405 --> 01:24:51.606]  I don't see much indication of that.
[01:25:08.355 --> 01:25:09.856]  Well, I don't believe so.
[01:25:09.856 --> 01:25:19.039]  I think there's a profound hatred by the Wall Street groups themselves of Mrs. Clinton, because they've put all their money into Obama.
[01:25:19.039 --> 01:25:24.361]  It's about a third of a billion dollars so far, and they've been stabbing Clinton in the back.
[01:25:24.361 --> 01:25:30.323]  Clinton, up until about December, had seemed to be the candidate of Wall Street, but that turned out not to be the case.
[01:25:30.903 --> 01:25:47.613]  So, what you've got now is the Rockefeller, Soros, Bilderberg, Trilateral, Rand Corporation, Council on Foreign Relations, Skull and Bones, Chicago School, uh, foundations, the guys of the Ford Foundation, all of this aligning.
[01:25:47.613 --> 01:25:50.855]  You can hear the foundations, by the way, on National Public Radio.
[01:25:50.855 --> 01:25:57.379]  If you want to know what the foundations think, we have foundation-funded oligarch radio, NPR and PBS.
[01:25:57.839 --> 01:25:58.660]  On the TV, right?
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:07.407]  Whatever Bill Moyers does, he's the spokesman for this huge power of the family fondue that are now ensconced in the foundations.
[01:26:07.407 --> 01:26:08.768]  So think about it.
[01:26:08.768 --> 01:26:10.309]  So you're saying Bill Moyers is bad?
[01:26:11.084 --> 01:26:11.964]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:26:11.964 --> 01:26:13.965]  You know, he was the spokesman for Johnson.
[01:26:13.965 --> 01:26:16.126]  He was selling the Vietnam War back then.
[01:26:16.126 --> 01:26:23.688]  And he is, I think, one of the leading operatives of this foundation universe, which is what has produced Obama.
[01:26:23.688 --> 01:26:31.170]  Obama is a racist provocateur, a race invader, or race monger, or I would say poverty pimp.
[01:26:31.170 --> 01:26:36.092]  When Obama says he was a community organizer, what in the world does that mean?
[01:26:36.092 --> 01:26:37.953]  I was a poverty... He was a race...
[01:26:39.534 --> 01:26:39.854]  Okay.
[01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.630]  Well, I agree.
[01:26:57.630 --> 01:26:59.372]  Look at what the Great Society did.
[01:26:59.372 --> 01:27:01.634]  It basically destroyed.
[01:27:01.634 --> 01:27:03.695]  You had black illegitimacy at 10%.
[01:27:03.695 --> 01:27:05.377]  Now it's over 90%.
[01:27:05.377 --> 01:27:07.258]  It's totally wrecked those communities.
[01:27:07.258 --> 01:27:17.327]  And we know, going back to Margaret Sanger, with the letters to the Colgates and others, saying we've got to hire blacks to go in so we can sterilize them and kill them.
[01:27:17.327 --> 01:27:19.368]  These black weeds only trust other blacks.
[01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:22.351]  So we've got to create a cadre of foundation blacks that serve us.
[01:27:22.831 --> 01:27:25.033]  Yeah, this is a factor.
[01:27:25.033 --> 01:27:31.277]  I would, however, point to the great turning point in United States history, the great U-turn, is under Carter.
[01:27:31.277 --> 01:27:37.382]  And Carter, of course, is a trilateral puppet, selected by Brzezinski personally, approved by David Rockefeller.
[01:27:38.182 --> 01:27:40.123]  A similar operation to what we have today.
[01:27:40.123 --> 01:27:42.284]  Jimmy, who comes out of nowhere... Why did they destroy him then?
[01:27:42.284 --> 01:27:44.706]  I mean, I don't think Carter himself is bad.
[01:27:44.706 --> 01:27:45.946]  Carter is bad, yes.
[01:27:45.946 --> 01:27:47.507]  Carter... Look at those speeches.
[01:27:47.507 --> 01:27:49.428]  Go back and look at the Malez speech.
[01:27:49.428 --> 01:27:55.952]  Go back and look at Carter's rage at the American people saying the energy crisis is real and you better believe it.
[01:27:55.952 --> 01:27:59.474]  Now, this is also very interesting in terms of trilateral mentality.
[01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:03.136]  Carter's famous Malez speech, the crisis of spirit,
[01:28:03.676 --> 01:28:15.062]  ...of July 1979 is essentially an incompetent, failed president blaming the American people for the fact that we have an incompetent ruling elite.
[01:28:15.062 --> 01:28:17.803]  The Wall Street ruling class is incompetent.
[01:28:17.803 --> 01:28:19.704]  They're incapable of governing.
[01:28:19.704 --> 01:28:25.547]  They have destroyed the greatest economic power in the world, and this is precisely the point.
[01:28:25.547 --> 01:28:28.229]  Under Carter, you have Brzezinski running this
[01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:35.279]  Lunatic, adventurist, anti-Soviet, pro-Islamic fundamentalist foreign policy featuring Khomeini.
[01:28:35.279 --> 01:28:36.260]  That's one side.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:45.053]  The other side, of course, is Paul Adolf Volcker at the Federal Reserve with a 22% prime rate, the highest in American history, at least recent history.
[01:28:45.633 --> 01:28:48.575]  And, of course, for most of us, 22% is the prime rate.
[01:28:48.575 --> 01:28:49.276]  We don't get that.
[01:28:49.276 --> 01:28:52.098]  We get 30% or 35%.
[01:28:52.098 --> 01:28:55.500]  And this is, of course, when the racket of credit cards usually began.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:59.783]  And it is when the United States began to de-industrialize.
[01:28:59.783 --> 01:29:07.408]  The factories that could not be destroyed by Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Stalin, and Mao were destroyed by vultures.
[01:29:07.408 --> 01:29:11.711]  Yes, the neoliberal de-industrialization for control of the population.
[01:29:11.711 --> 01:29:12.272]  Neo-serfdom.
[01:29:13.273 --> 01:29:19.418]  And the idea of a low-wage economy, union busting, the labor movement in full retreat.
[01:29:19.418 --> 01:29:24.503]  But all covered with an envelope, all covered with an envelope of liberalism.
[01:29:24.503 --> 01:29:26.705]  And left covered, this is exactly it.
[01:29:26.705 --> 01:29:36.654]  Under environmentalism, the limits of growth, the era of scarcity, and of course in foreign policy, human rights and humanitarian concerns.
[01:29:36.654 --> 01:29:38.696]  Stay there, I totally agree with you on the analysis.
[01:29:39.296 --> 01:29:40.696]  We want to get all your perspectives on it.
[01:29:40.696 --> 01:29:51.540]  Let's explain to people this whole Malthusian, social Darwinistic world system and how it controls both the left and the right and break that down.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:30:00.602]  We're on the... Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:30:00.602 --> 01:30:02.383]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:30:05.754 --> 01:30:08.940]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.265]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:30:11.265 --> 01:30:13.749]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:30:15.914 --> 01:30:22.258]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:30:22.258 --> 01:30:29.181]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:30:29.181 --> 01:30:34.164]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:30:34.164 --> 01:30:37.106]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[01:30:37.106 --> 01:30:41.288]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[01:30:41.288 --> 01:30:44.370]  We have to work the dark side, or we're going to spend time in the shadows.
[01:30:45.666 --> 01:30:49.689]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[01:30:49.689 --> 01:30:50.750]  Well, join me.
[01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:53.392]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[01:30:53.392 --> 01:30:56.735]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:30:56.735 --> 01:31:03.641]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:31:16.377 --> 01:31:32.800]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, TruthNews.us, Webster Griffin Tarbley wrote the unauthorized biography, the first big one, back in the early 1990s, about George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:40.582]  He of course wrote Synthetic Terror, and they carried out the 9-11 attacks, government inside job, black-off contractor job.
[01:31:41.889 --> 01:31:49.599]  And of course, he's got the new Barack Obama, the Postmodern Coup, available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:49.599 --> 01:31:53.203]  Okay, Webster, I'm going to turn the mic off here and give you the floor.
[01:31:57.821 --> 01:32:19.455]  I think we should start at the beginning here about where this new order comes from, who they really are, so people don't get confused by all the left cover, right cover, to bring us up to today with Barack Obama, who I agree with you is probably the biggest threat to liberty, only because of the figurehead and the cover he gives them, not that he actually runs anything or not that I'm saying McCain's a good guy.
[01:32:19.455 --> 01:32:21.436]  So start at the beginning if you can.
[01:32:22.137 --> 01:32:33.041]  And because of the fascist mass movement, or again, reasonable facsimile of a fascist mass movement which Obama has been able to mobilize, and no other.
[01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:35.281]  This is the qualitative distinction.
[01:32:35.281 --> 01:32:42.924]  This is why Obama is, far and away, the worst possible outcome, and needs to be opposed in any possible way.
[01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:44.504]  I wouldn't call it the New World Order.
[01:32:44.504 --> 01:32:47.225]  I'd call it Anglo-American world empire.
[01:32:47.225 --> 01:32:49.506]  U.S.-British world domination.
[01:32:49.506 --> 01:32:50.226]  This is what it is.
[01:32:50.866 --> 01:32:56.071]  Uh, there are of course... But a rose is a rose by any other name, Webster, I'd interrupt here.
[01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:59.254]  That's what they call it, it's branded as that.
[01:32:59.254 --> 01:33:06.341]  So yes, World Empire, run by the Anglo-American Power Axis, is the proper term, but I mean, New World Order is what it's known as.
[01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:12.026]  Well, again, let me call it Anglo-American World Empire because I think it gets the idea.
[01:33:12.026 --> 01:33:14.109]  There are, of course, others that are allied with it.
[01:33:14.109 --> 01:33:19.374]  The European Union, the Euro-Garcs are largely submissive to this.
[01:33:19.374 --> 01:33:20.675]  Russia is not submissive.
[01:33:20.675 --> 01:33:25.840]  I think it makes no sense at all to say Putin and Medvedev now are figures of the New World Order.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:26.561]  They are not.
[01:33:26.561 --> 01:33:27.342]  They are opponents.
[01:33:28.223 --> 01:33:47.561]  As much as they can be, of this Anglo-American world empire, China is in a somewhat more ambiguous position in terms of what you see, but we have reliable reports that underneath it, the Chinese are even more hostile to the continued Anglo-American world domination and they're biding
[01:33:48.121 --> 01:33:48.761]  There are times.
[01:33:48.761 --> 01:33:58.745]  So I welcome the existence of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which has posed a counterweight to the U.S.
[01:33:58.745 --> 01:33:59.365]  and the British.
[01:33:59.365 --> 01:34:11.190]  I would say without Putin, we would have had a police state here already, because it is the existence of this international opposition that prevents the Wall Street group from imposing what they want here.
[01:34:11.190 --> 01:34:15.832]  The problem we have right now, the strategic constellation that Obama comes out of,
[01:34:16.492 --> 01:34:23.395]  Is that we've had the incompetent and disastrous administration of Bush Cheney and the neocons.
[01:34:23.395 --> 01:34:36.340]  Now, their approach is, the world is focused on the Middle East, everything revolves around Israel, you've got to destroy the leading Arab state, you've got to destroy the leading Islamic state, I guess Iraq and Iran.
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:42.722]  You've got to go into Afghanistan, primarily on an anti-Islamic mission.
[01:34:42.722 --> 01:34:45.423]  Brzezinski would say, do go there, but not for that.
[01:34:46.161 --> 01:35:00.704]  And, therefore, this has been played out now under the bankrupt and idiotic mythology of 9-11, which you've done so much to expose, and some of the rest of us have also tried to do this.
[01:35:00.704 --> 01:35:04.245]  The thing is, you're getting to the point of diminishing returns with that.
[01:35:04.245 --> 01:35:11.047]  It is simply impossible to keep going with the 9-11, Islamofascism, bin Laden, al-Qaeda, war on terror.
[01:35:11.047 --> 01:35:15.648]  There's even this report from the Rand Corporation, where Brzezinski thinks you need something new.
[01:35:16.559 --> 01:35:18.940]  Now, it's an interesting case.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:24.221]  Normally, when people talk about the Hegelian dialectic in politics, I think this is much overstated.
[01:35:24.221 --> 01:35:26.241]  The British are really not.
[01:35:26.241 --> 01:35:27.382]  It's very crude.
[01:35:27.382 --> 01:35:28.242]  Divide and conquer.
[01:35:28.242 --> 01:35:31.463]  But he was a professor trained in Germany.
[01:35:31.463 --> 01:35:42.985]  He wrote a book about the 17th century, the age of the Baroque, and with Brzezinski, co-authored some books about totalitarianism, targeting, of course, the Soviets, anti-Russians.
[01:35:42.985 --> 01:35:44.206]  Alfred Weber.
[01:35:44.206 --> 01:35:45.286]  So, Alfred Weber
[01:35:45.986 --> 01:35:55.377]  Is the younger brother of Max Weber, Max Weber, the German sociologist around, you know, from about 1890 to 1920.
[01:35:55.377 --> 01:35:57.359]  He was extremely influential.
[01:35:57.359 --> 01:36:00.263]  The guy wrote books about the Protestant ethic and all kinds of other things.
[01:36:00.803 --> 01:36:06.347]  In Alfred Weber, there is a Galean philosophy of history element.
[01:36:06.347 --> 01:36:10.431]  So the idea simply is, you cannot be Johnny One Note.
[01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:16.776]  You cannot do your operations always under right-wing, militaristic, top-down cover.
[01:36:16.776 --> 01:36:20.859]  You've got to modulate that, and we're now in the middle of a modulation.
[01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:23.581]  Carter was a similar phase.
[01:36:23.581 --> 01:36:25.983]  Carter dropped the usual Cold War stuff.
[01:36:26.523 --> 01:36:35.231]  But he continued it in a more ferocious form, under the guise of human rights, humanitarianism, and interfering in the internal affairs of countries.
[01:36:35.231 --> 01:36:42.618]  Carter was also on a worldwide vendetta to shut down peaceful nuclear energy development, but under left cover.
[01:36:42.618 --> 01:36:48.204]  Not saying, we want you to be puppets of our empire, but saying we don't like nuclear energy.
[01:36:48.544 --> 01:37:00.048]  So when we reach a point by about 2006-2007 where the Anglo-American ruling class says Bush and Cheney are crazy, the neocons are bankrupt, we're not getting anywhere.
[01:37:00.048 --> 01:37:05.530]  We cannot have the US, the British, and the Israelis at war with the world forever.
[01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:06.310]  It doesn't work.
[01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:07.930]  We're too bankrupt.
[01:37:07.930 --> 01:37:09.110]  We're too isolated.
[01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:11.231]  Our armies are defeated and demoralized.
[01:37:11.231 --> 01:37:13.591]  Our populations are extremely restive.
[01:37:13.591 --> 01:37:20.473]  We've got a possible mass upsurge around impeachment and anti-Bush, anti-Cheney, end the war, and all this.
[01:37:20.473 --> 01:37:24.154]  So basically they say, let's repeat the Carter operation.
[01:37:24.154 --> 01:37:36.416]  They had been grooming Obama, in my view, since about 1981 to 1983, when Obama and Brzezinski were together on the campus of Columbia University, Morningside Heights in Manhattan.
[01:37:37.216 --> 01:37:39.718]  And recruited him, as far as I can see.
[01:37:39.718 --> 01:37:46.561]  I would hope that Obama would comment on this, if he doesn't like this particular view of his background.
[01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:51.064]  But he's one of a series of controlled assets.
[01:37:51.064 --> 01:37:56.407]  Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who spouts the self-same rhetoric, is another one.
[01:37:56.407 --> 01:37:59.749]  And there are undoubtedly other options, not all black, to be sure.
[01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:10.220]  Others, you know, southern governors or, you know, northern gritty populists or whatever, but all controlled by this trilateral commission.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:13.483]  So now the idea is they're basically two-fold.
[01:38:13.483 --> 01:38:19.510]  If you're going to continue Anglo-American world domination, the US-UK world empire,
[01:38:20.211 --> 01:38:35.579]  You've got to deal with the fact that you've got this Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russia-China military power, and a tremendous energy power, the Chinese, the greatest demographic power in terms of people, and the highest rates of economic development.
[01:38:35.579 --> 01:38:38.681]  The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is a magnet.
[01:38:38.681 --> 01:38:40.021]  It's the counter-pole.
[01:38:40.021 --> 01:38:48.406]  Anybody who doesn't like the Anglo-Americans, for example, especially in Africa, if you're an African state, you have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
[01:38:49.026 --> 01:38:51.610]  Trying to crush you, destroy you, loot you.
[01:38:51.610 --> 01:38:54.073]  The Chinese come along and say, let's make deals 50-50.
[01:38:54.073 --> 01:39:02.605]  It's not humanitarianism, but it's business and it's much better to have an alternative as it was possible during the Cold War.
[01:39:02.605 --> 01:39:06.370]  So Brzezinski basically says, we've got to crush Russia and China.
[01:39:06.930 --> 01:39:07.750]  How do you do that?
[01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:09.591]  Well, it goes like this.
[01:39:09.591 --> 01:39:11.571]  First, kick the Chinese out of Africa.
[01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:12.872]  That's why you've got the U.S.
[01:39:12.872 --> 01:39:14.012]  African Command.
[01:39:14.012 --> 01:39:20.634]  You've got the destabilization of Kenya by Obama's cousin, Odinga, who is the... I call him the killer Luo.
[01:39:20.634 --> 01:39:23.895]  He's the necklacer of Kenya.
[01:39:23.895 --> 01:39:27.256]  The Luos, by the way, with the Luos, it's a little bit like the Kurds.
[01:39:27.256 --> 01:39:28.576]  You can destabilize Kenya.
[01:39:29.136 --> 01:39:32.618]  Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Congo.
[01:39:32.618 --> 01:39:39.441]  You can destabilize five countries using these luaus that Obama happens to represent.
[01:39:39.441 --> 01:39:41.382]  So you've got to kick the Chinese out.
[01:39:41.382 --> 01:39:45.984]  The interest in Zimbabwe is, of course, that's where the Chinese get their minerals.
[01:39:45.984 --> 01:39:46.624]  So the U.S.
[01:39:46.624 --> 01:39:49.626]  and the British say, oh, it's a humanitarian emergency.
[01:39:49.626 --> 01:39:51.327]  Mugabe is a bad man.
[01:39:51.327 --> 01:39:52.467]  Let's get rid of him.
[01:39:52.467 --> 01:39:54.208]  Real reason, Chinese minerals.
[01:39:54.708 --> 01:40:00.112]  Sudan, the best example, the biggest country in Africa, that's about 7% of the Chinese oil.
[01:40:00.112 --> 01:40:06.957]  Therefore, the Anglo-Americans gin up this Darfur crisis, which is real, but not created by the Sudanese government.
[01:40:06.957 --> 01:40:12.541]  It's partly a feature of the world oil price and, you know, starvation and so forth going on there.
[01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:18.285]  But the first thing, therefore, is try to destroy every Chinese ally you can in Africa.
[01:40:18.285 --> 01:40:19.526]  Kick the Chinese out.
[01:40:19.526 --> 01:40:20.787]  Cut off the oil and the minerals.
[01:40:21.443 --> 01:40:27.445]  Destroy places like Burma, Chinese ally, and destroy Pakistan.
[01:40:27.445 --> 01:40:30.146]  Carve Pakistan into four to five pieces.
[01:40:30.146 --> 01:40:38.949]  Even though the current government of Pakistan is Anglo-American puppets, the conducting of the Afghan war is now only targeting, really,
[01:40:39.690 --> 01:40:45.036]  Pakistan, bombing Pakistan, humiliating the government, and preparing the breakup of that country.
[01:40:45.036 --> 01:40:45.897]  Why?
[01:40:45.897 --> 01:40:52.546]  It is a natural ally of China against India, always has been, and it's an important commercial partner.
[01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:57.152]  The endgame is, once you've got China stripped of allies and isolated,
[01:40:57.672 --> 01:41:03.716]  Brzezinski says to the Chinese, look, you want oil, you want minerals, go and get them in Siberia.
[01:41:03.716 --> 01:41:08.439]  Go to war with Russia, invade Siberia, and you can get everything you want.
[01:41:08.439 --> 01:41:12.221]  Siberia has lots of minerals, lots of oil, very few Russians.
[01:41:12.221 --> 01:41:13.141]  Let's have World War III.
[01:41:14.671 --> 01:41:20.555]  It means, therefore, play China against Russia, destroy them both, get rid of them both, and the U.S.
[01:41:20.555 --> 01:41:24.037]  and the British can have another hundred years of world domination.
[01:41:24.037 --> 01:41:32.723]  This is exactly the same project we had with Lady Astor, Lord Astor, the Cliveden set in Britain.
[01:41:32.723 --> 01:41:34.965]  It's the great game of divide and conquer, simply put.
[01:41:35.325 --> 01:41:49.975]  Lord Lothian, Lord Halifax, Lord Brand, Prescott Bush, John Foster Dulles, Lord Montegut Norman of the Bank of England, Sir Henry Deterding of Royal Dutch Shell, and they basically said, we'll call this appeasement, but it's not appeasement, it's war.
[01:41:49.975 --> 01:41:51.076]  Let's build up Hitler.
[01:41:51.736 --> 01:41:53.298]  And we'll point him east.
[01:41:53.298 --> 01:41:54.459]  We'll encourage him to go east.
[01:41:54.459 --> 01:41:58.003]  And that's all on record with Lord Milner and the Milner Group and the rest of them.
[01:41:58.003 --> 01:41:59.585]  And that's exactly it.
[01:41:59.585 --> 01:42:01.407]  The Milner Group is the Cliveden set.
[01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:04.771]  That's a different name for it in the later phase.
[01:42:04.771 --> 01:42:07.714]  Then there's Carroll Quigley and many others.
[01:42:07.714 --> 01:42:09.917]  He was a historian for the British Round Table Group.
[01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:15.683]  Yeah, but he does tell you the story, and he presents it as bad, because of course it didn't work.
[01:42:15.683 --> 01:42:23.671]  So their idea is, play Hitler against Stalin, and get rid of both of them that way, and we can have another hundred years of the British Empire.
[01:42:23.671 --> 01:42:30.818]  No, it didn't work, because of course you get Hitler making the Hitler-Stalin pact, and then turning West, and destroying the French.
[01:42:31.838 --> 01:42:37.422]  And the Scandinavians, and the Low Countries, and so forth, and the British get themselves into a fix.
[01:42:37.422 --> 01:42:39.203]  They're going to be destroyed unless the U.S.
[01:42:39.203 --> 01:42:40.684]  comes to save them.
[01:42:40.684 --> 01:42:49.370]  So that's one of the reasons that Winston Churchill was the main beneficiary of Pearl Harbor, and I believe did the most to make sure that this was a surprise attack.
[01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:59.396]  Yeah, but then you see, Tarbelly, I agree with all this analysis, but then you throw in that Roosevelt was a good guy when we know he put in the oil embargoes and...
[01:43:02.218 --> 01:43:05.259]  Let me just throw this out, though, and then get your take on it.
[01:43:05.259 --> 01:43:10.319]  You have Roosevelt putting the oil embargo on the Japanese.
[01:43:10.319 --> 01:43:24.142]  You have Roosevelt intensifying military action through the groups they'd set up after the Boxer Rebellion into the Flying Tigers to engage militarily the Japanese U.S.
[01:43:24.142 --> 01:43:25.762]  trained forces and even U.S.
[01:43:25.762 --> 01:43:30.143]  pilots, quote, as contractors, start engaging and start shooting down
[01:43:30.763 --> 01:43:31.824]  The British know, wait a minute.
[01:43:31.824 --> 01:43:32.845]  The British know, the U.S.
[01:43:32.845 --> 01:43:33.526]  does not know.
[01:43:59.082 --> 01:44:00.122]  This is the point.
[01:44:00.122 --> 01:44:01.483]  The British have the Japanese... Oh, really?
[01:44:01.483 --> 01:44:05.384]  Is that why the four submarines attacked Pearl Harbor and they were ordered to still stand down?
[01:44:05.384 --> 01:44:10.925]  The Japanese naval code, JN-28, had been broken by the British.
[01:44:10.925 --> 01:44:14.546]  The purple code, the diplomatic code, had been broken by the U.S.
[01:44:14.546 --> 01:44:15.206]  So the U.S.
[01:44:15.206 --> 01:44:18.827]  knew an attack was probably imminent, but not where or when.
[01:44:18.827 --> 01:44:25.109]  The Honolulu advertiser Webster ran a headline a week before saying the Japanese will attack Pearl Harbor on December 7th.
[01:44:25.925 --> 01:44:28.027]  Yeah, then that's... Our military didn't know, though.
[01:44:28.027 --> 01:44:29.669]  Look, here's the problem, Tarbley.
[01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:33.613]  I wonder why the commanders didn't send out some picket boats.
[01:44:33.613 --> 01:44:34.854]  You know, some trawlers.
[01:44:34.854 --> 01:44:37.236]  Listen... Stop, stop, stop.
[01:44:37.236 --> 01:44:38.518]  Just for a second, Tarbley.
[01:44:38.518 --> 01:44:40.980]  I totally... Look, I know you're a great historian, smart guy.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:42.061]  That's why we have you here.
[01:44:42.061 --> 01:44:43.042]  That's why I sell your books.
[01:44:43.042 --> 01:44:44.484]  I like you.
[01:44:44.484 --> 01:44:46.966]  But I'm really trying to get down to fundamentals here.
[01:44:46.966 --> 01:44:48.127]  Because you have this...
[01:44:49.981 --> 01:45:03.553]  Historical perspective that Roosevelt's a great guy, and we do have on one end the Bush-Nazi-Milner angle trying to overthrow him as they brought Hitler to power right around the same time in 35-36 here in the United States.
[01:45:03.553 --> 01:45:08.417]  So there's truth to what you're saying, but there's a subtler, just like you said, left cover.
[01:45:08.417 --> 01:45:11.540]  The same interests were also hedging their bets with Roosevelt.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:14.863]  So this whole thing about Roosevelt being a good guy, I just don't buy into.
[01:45:15.746 --> 01:45:23.190]  Remember that the relation of the Morgan Group to Roosevelt is that they tried to kill him in Miami before he was inaugurated.
[01:45:23.190 --> 01:45:34.735]  They tried to organize a coup against him in the form of the Morgan coup, the Mussolini-style march on Washington, the Smedley-Butler revelations, and so forth, the Dick Stein Committee.
[01:45:34.735 --> 01:45:43.339]  And, according to Elliot Roosevelt, the Churchill gang poisoned Roosevelt and killed him so that the British could launch the Cold War in the wake of this.
[01:45:43.339 --> 01:45:44.760]  Just on the Japanese question.
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:49.721]  The argument that you make depends on the idea that the Japanese are a benign power.
[01:45:49.721 --> 01:45:51.862]  The Japanese are amazing... I'm not saying they're a benign power.
[01:45:51.862 --> 01:45:52.682]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:45:52.682 --> 01:45:54.423]  I'm not saying they're a benign power.
[01:45:54.423 --> 01:45:56.703]  I'm saying they were, but see that's what brought the U.S.
[01:45:56.703 --> 01:45:57.144]  into the war.
[01:45:57.144 --> 01:46:02.745]  That's what I brought up Japan was, was, was the British screaming for help and now the U.S.
[01:46:02.745 --> 01:46:05.766]  comes in after the Pearl Harbor attack.
[01:46:05.766 --> 01:46:06.806]  I'm saying there was total
[01:46:08.767 --> 01:46:13.211]  I recommend the book by Russ Bridger and Nave, which explains this question of the codes.
[01:46:13.211 --> 01:46:20.637]  That the British had broken the Japanese naval code, but did not share the details of where the attack would come.
[01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:43.024]  But the British, therefore... The other problem is, the people who were controlling the intelligence were Stimson of Wall Street and of the invisible government, and Marshall, similarly.
[01:46:43.024 --> 01:46:45.948]  The question is, they cut off intelligence to Roosevelt.
[01:46:45.948 --> 01:46:48.611]  It's not that Roosevelt didn't give the Navy the intelligence.
[01:46:49.251 --> 01:46:51.093]  This is crazy.
[01:46:51.093 --> 01:47:02.925]  It is that the commanders and above all this, there's a guy called Admiral Richmond K. Turner in the Navy Department, who is the MARPLOT, the inside operative and all this.
[01:47:02.925 --> 01:47:04.746]  He is the one who withholds the...
[01:47:06.551 --> 01:47:19.707]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:47:19.707 --> 01:47:23.532]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:47:23.812 --> 01:47:24.172]  We're good to go.
[01:47:48.547 --> 01:47:49.128]  I think so.
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:11.862]  Fat burners.
[01:48:11.862 --> 01:48:13.123]  I like the sound of that.
[01:48:13.123 --> 01:48:14.265]  Fat burners.
[01:48:14.265 --> 01:48:16.127]  Life change fat burners.
[01:48:16.127 --> 01:48:21.474]  When fat burners are used in conjunction with life change tea, you're going to see a change in your life.
[01:48:21.474 --> 01:48:23.017]  Maybe you'll be a movie star.
[01:48:23.017 --> 01:48:24.759]  Maybe you'll drive NASCAR.
[01:48:24.759 --> 01:48:25.460]  Maybe you'll be a
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.441]  Lion Tamer.
[01:48:26.441 --> 01:48:28.362]  Well, maybe not Lion Tamer.
[01:48:28.362 --> 01:48:32.566]  Get energy, lose weight, get the T dot com.
[01:48:32.566 --> 01:48:34.007]  That's get the T dot com.
[01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:37.170]  Your fat burners and T are available at get the T dot com.
[01:48:37.170 --> 01:48:40.792]  Get energy, lose weight, get the T dot com.
[01:48:40.792 --> 01:48:44.716]  Your fat burners and T are available at get the T dot com.
[01:48:44.716 --> 01:48:47.618]  That's get the T, T-E-A, dot com.
[01:48:47.618 --> 01:48:48.199]  Or call us, 928-308-0457.
[01:48:56.662 --> 01:49:09.145]  Every week, thousands of violent crimes are committed.
[01:49:09.145 --> 01:49:11.285]  Don't let yourself become a statistic.
[01:49:11.285 --> 01:49:12.165]  Be smart.
[01:49:12.165 --> 01:49:12.925]  Be safe.
[01:49:12.925 --> 01:49:15.266]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.
[01:49:15.266 --> 01:49:20.727]  Pepperspray.com is the only website you'll ever need for all of your non-lethal self-defense supplies.
[01:49:21.067 --> 01:49:26.888]  Pepperspray.com carries one of the largest assortments of pepper spray and personal safety products on the web.

[01:50:26.926 --> 01:50:37.088]  Webster Tarbley, author, is our guest, author of the new book, Barack Obama and Postmodern Coup, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:37.088 --> 01:50:40.129]  His historical analysis is spot-on.
[01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:41.529]  I agree with him.
[01:50:41.529 --> 01:50:43.969]  I trust but verify.
[01:50:43.969 --> 01:50:46.670]  I just disagree, Webster, with your analysis.
[01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:47.530]  It's all rancid.
[01:50:47.530 --> 01:50:48.290]  They're all bad.
[01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:49.150]  Hillary's bad.
[01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:50.010]  John McCain's bad.
[01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:52.491]  I know you know that, but saying that
[01:50:53.382 --> 01:51:03.189]  We have to throw support in behind Hillary or then McCain later, which is the same thing that so many others are saying.
[01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:04.650]  I just can't do it.
[01:51:04.650 --> 01:51:08.893]  I can't support the false paradigm of the left-right or any of these people.
[01:51:08.893 --> 01:51:12.895]  And if fascism's to come, let Barack Obama and his greenie-meenies bring it.
[01:51:12.895 --> 01:51:14.797]  Let them try to come burn me out.
[01:51:14.797 --> 01:51:17.038]  We got guns in this country.
[01:51:17.038 --> 01:51:20.501]  And maybe that's what we need is to go ahead.
[01:51:20.501 --> 01:51:21.361]  Worse is better.
[01:51:21.361 --> 01:51:22.422]  Bring this thing to a head.
[01:51:23.266 --> 01:51:25.788]  Now, what do you expect to see the way the lay of the land is right now?
[01:51:25.788 --> 01:51:27.669]  Let's hear some predictions from Webster Darbly.
[01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:37.056]  I'd say that one of the obvious things built into an Obama presidency is the possibility of domestic civil war coming through a number of scenarios.
[01:51:37.056 --> 01:51:50.866]  I would just say I have a great-grandfather who fought at Gettysburg in the Valley of Death there by the Devil's Den and Little Round Top in the 11th United States, regulars of the Sykes
[01:51:51.844 --> 01:51:54.445]  5th Corps, 2nd Division.
[01:51:54.445 --> 01:51:57.806]  Civil War is the worst possible outcome.
[01:51:57.806 --> 01:52:01.948]  Nothing, but nothing, is worse than civil war.
[01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:04.169]  And I think that's the problem.
[01:52:04.169 --> 01:52:08.070]  No, the CPS taking people's children and putting sodium fluoride in the water.
[01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:09.591]  We're all under total war.
[01:52:09.591 --> 01:52:12.212]  You know about the eugenicist, Webster, you're an expert on that.
[01:52:12.212 --> 01:52:16.513]  Yeah, sure, but again, I think there are peaceful ways out of this.
[01:52:16.513 --> 01:52:17.954]  I want a peaceful way out of this too.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:24.882]  The method that I recommend is to build a mass movement through mobilization.
[01:52:24.882 --> 01:52:29.284]  And mobilization has to involve the choice of intermediate goals.
[01:52:29.284 --> 01:52:30.844]  In other words, things that people can do.
[01:52:30.844 --> 01:52:34.926]  Right now, it is to stop Obama, and that means, you know,
[01:52:35.846 --> 01:52:41.187]  Practically speaking, blocking with other forces that might oppose Obama.
[01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:44.108]  And again, this is based on the history of Italy 1922-1933.
[01:52:44.108 --> 01:52:54.890]  For example, in the German case, you had a lot of people saying, why don't the Communists and the Social Democrats form a bloc and stop Hitler?
[01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:56.751]  For many reasons, they didn't do it.
[01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:57.851]  They had all good reasons.
[01:52:57.851 --> 01:53:02.012]  They said the other side is really bad and really corrupt and really awful.
[01:53:02.532 --> 01:53:07.674]  And then, once Hitler came to power, they kept saying, well, I wish we had done it.
[01:53:07.674 --> 01:53:13.116]  But let me just continue the thing I was trying to do about the world situation.
[01:53:13.116 --> 01:53:18.977]  Part of it is now this question of attempting to repeat the maneuver of the appeasers, right?
[01:53:18.977 --> 01:53:22.979]  The Neville Chamberlain policy, which was not appeasement, but war.
[01:53:22.979 --> 01:53:26.480]  In other words, when Obama says he wants to negotiate with Iran,
[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:31.743]  He wants to use Iran exactly the same way that Brzezinski's now using Georgia.
[01:53:31.743 --> 01:53:34.424]  In other words, play Iran against the Russians.
[01:53:34.424 --> 01:53:35.925]  That's his future for Iran.
[01:53:35.925 --> 01:53:37.867]  Brzezinski says, why should I attack them?
[01:53:37.867 --> 01:53:42.429]  I can use them to attack the Russians and get rid of all of them that way.
[01:53:42.429 --> 01:53:47.932]  And ultimately, the crowning achievement is China against Russia, except it won't work.
[01:53:47.932 --> 01:53:51.935]  The other side now... But Iran's getting along with Russia.
[01:53:51.935 --> 01:53:52.055]  Who?
[01:53:53.035 --> 01:53:55.256]  Iran has been getting along with Russia.
[01:53:55.256 --> 01:53:59.619]  Look, if you know any Iranians, ask them the following question.
[01:53:59.619 --> 01:54:03.041]  What country is most hated in Iran?
[01:54:03.041 --> 01:54:07.083]  And every time I've asked this question, which I ask habitually, it's always Russia.
[01:54:07.762 --> 01:54:14.305]  Russia, remember, occupied Northern Iran during World War II as part of the Lend-Lease Program.
[01:54:14.305 --> 01:54:17.787]  There was a military corridor going through Iran.
[01:54:17.787 --> 01:54:21.349]  The British occupied the South, the Soviets the North.
[01:54:21.349 --> 01:54:23.550]  Now, the Soviets behaved badly.
[01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:26.192]  They were very angry about Hitler and so forth.
[01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:28.653]  No, the Soviets did bad things!
[01:54:29.393 --> 01:54:30.294]  Yeah, they treated him very badly.
[01:54:30.294 --> 01:54:31.454]  I thought they were sweet!
[01:54:31.454 --> 01:54:35.296]  And the residue of that is a hatred that Brzezinski thinks he can build on.
[01:54:35.296 --> 01:54:38.357]  Well, I mean, you've got Russians in there with the Chinese building the reactors.
[01:54:38.357 --> 01:54:39.717]  I don't... I don't know.
[01:54:39.717 --> 01:54:43.599]  Alright, well, I know they think that Webster's just all delusional.
[01:54:43.599 --> 01:54:47.761]  We'll be right back.
[01:54:47.761 --> 01:54:48.861]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:55:03.219 --> 01:55:04.800]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.481]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:55:06.481 --> 01:55:09.382]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:55:09.382 --> 01:55:13.624]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:55:13.624 --> 01:55:22.668]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:55:22.668 --> 01:55:27.490]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:55:31.810 --> 01:55:35.411]  How dare you?
[01:55:35.411 --> 01:55:38.992]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:55:38.992 --> 01:55:41.732]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:55:41.732 --> 01:55:48.213]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:55:58.958 --> 01:56:01.347]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:56:01.347 --> 01:56:04.117]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:12.031]  Big Brother.
[01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:13.792]  Mainstream media.
[01:56:13.792 --> 01:56:15.574]  Government cover-ups.
[01:56:15.574 --> 01:56:17.136]  You want answers?
[01:56:17.136 --> 01:56:19.058]  Well, so does he.
[01:56:19.058 --> 01:56:22.882]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:22.882 --> 01:56:26.986]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:56:26.986 --> 01:56:30.210]  You know, there's so many subjects I want to talk to Webster Tarpley about.
[01:56:30.210 --> 01:56:31.671]  Very thought-provoking discussions.
[01:56:31.671 --> 01:56:32.912]  We'll just keep for two more hours.
[01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:34.409]  He's agreed to do that.
[01:56:34.409 --> 01:56:35.290]  We appreciate that.
[01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:37.811]  Author of Obama, the Postmodernist Coup.
[01:56:37.811 --> 01:56:39.231]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:39.231 --> 01:56:42.933]  We're going to open the phones up in the final hour today.
[01:56:42.933 --> 01:56:49.356]  For the next hour, I want to get his analysis, which he really is an expert on Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, Russia.
[01:56:49.896 --> 01:56:52.157]  The Middle East, Central Asia.
[01:56:52.157 --> 01:56:54.678]  I want to get about 30 minutes of analysis from him on that.
[01:56:54.678 --> 01:57:06.562]  And then I want to, he is one of the few people, the reason I really recognized him in my own research a decade ago, was he got into the eugenics, the driving force, the social Darwinism of the elite, their true propulsion system.
[01:57:06.562 --> 01:57:09.603]  So we'll talk with him the last 30 minutes of this hour and then open phones
[01:57:10.343 --> 01:57:13.825]  Uh, Ian, in the last hour, we've had a lot of your calls coming up in about 58 minutes.
[01:57:13.825 --> 01:57:33.134]  Uh, but Webster, you wanted to finish up with the austerity movement, how they have the environmental movement, the austerity movement, the, uh, secret police system they're setting up, all of this massive, decades-long planning coming to a head with the Golden Boy, literally, uh, there to save us all and bring the left in for the final police state.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:47.505]  We've talked now, I guess, about the foreign policy, in other words, this Brzezinski plan, and in many world capitals, especially Moscow, especially Beijing, if you say Brzezinski plan, it's a plan, therefore, that has an endgame.
[01:57:47.505 --> 01:57:52.227]  China reduced to warlords, 20 to 25 centers of power, as it was in the 1920s.
[01:57:55.390 --> 01:58:08.554]  And Russia also divided up as it was during the Russian Civil War of 1919 to 1920, ultimately coming in with about four to five different states, different countries.
[01:58:08.554 --> 01:58:12.475]  So, we had the Bernard Lewis plan for the Middle East, right?
[01:58:12.475 --> 01:58:20.838]  Carve Iraq three ways, Iran six ways, Lebanon several ways, Turkey three or four ways, Sudan at least two ways, and more.
[01:58:21.693 --> 01:58:24.074]  But then, to apply that to Russia and China.
[01:58:24.074 --> 01:58:25.035]  So that's one thing.
[01:58:25.035 --> 01:58:28.597]  Now, the other side is the domestic and the austerity.
[01:58:28.597 --> 01:58:39.963]  When you see Obama giving this speech in Oregon, when he had his outburst there, he said, you're not going to be able to drive an SUV, alright?
[01:58:39.963 --> 01:58:42.925]  You're not going to be able to eat as much as you want.
[01:58:43.445 --> 01:58:44.446]  This is amazing.
[01:58:44.446 --> 01:58:54.678]  You're not going to be able to eat as much as you want and you can't keep your thermostat set where you want it at 72 degrees and think that the world will allow you to do this.
[01:58:54.678 --> 01:58:58.403]  And then in Germany, he said, called for a new world order last week.
[01:58:59.103 --> 01:59:05.007]  And he also, or a new international order, he also said you're going to have to work more and serve this global system.
[01:59:05.007 --> 01:59:08.909]  So he told us it was really a slave master's speech.
[01:59:08.909 --> 01:59:15.033]  This is what I would call killer austerity, genocidal austerity, a further cut in the U.S.
[01:59:15.033 --> 01:59:20.096]  standard of living of 30, 40, 50 percent as much as he can do.
[01:59:20.096 --> 01:59:27.261]  Imagine a government policy of not having a good standard of living, which has always been what the eugenicists have craved.
[01:59:28.079 --> 01:59:29.261]  Absolutely.
[01:59:29.261 --> 01:59:34.306]  But now it's also complicated by the fact that we have this worldwide financial crisis.
[01:59:34.306 --> 01:59:37.690]  We have the death agony of the dollar as a reserve currency.
[01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:39.912]  We have banking panic going on.
[01:59:39.912 --> 01:59:40.973]  We had Countrywide.
[01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:42.175]  Then we had Northern Rock.
[01:59:42.175 --> 01:59:43.696]  We had Bear Stearns.
[01:59:43.696 --> 01:59:44.778]  Now we've had IndyMac.
[01:59:44.778 --> 01:59:47.621]  We basically have banking failures every week.
[01:59:48.482 --> 01:59:54.608]  We've got hyperinflation, which you see in fuel, but also in food and many other areas.
[01:59:54.608 --> 02:00:03.296]  So you're heading towards an extreme world economic breakdown crisis, the end of the post-1945 era, as Soros himself says.
[02:00:03.296 --> 02:00:05.619]  So when Soros says, this is what it is, what does he want?
[02:00:06.159 --> 02:00:10.920]  They've got to increase the looting pressure on the U.S.
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:18.282]  population to allow the bailout of JPMorgan Chase, the Soros interests, Goldman Sachs, and so forth.
[02:00:18.282 --> 02:00:19.882]  How do you do that, though?
[02:00:19.882 --> 02:00:26.564]  Bush and Cheney would come out and say, well, we're going to tax you for the war on terror, and that would lead to an explosion in their face.
[02:00:26.564 --> 02:00:27.704]  Obama will come and say,
[02:00:28.396 --> 02:00:30.417]  We're going to save the polar bears.
[02:00:30.417 --> 02:00:31.637]  We're going to save the planet.
[02:00:31.637 --> 02:00:33.478]  We're going to save the ice caps.
[02:00:33.478 --> 02:00:38.040]  We're going to have carbon tax, cap and trade on carbon.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:39.601]  We're going to have a green tax.
[02:00:39.601 --> 02:00:41.862]  We're going to have a third world solidarity tax.
[02:00:41.862 --> 02:00:52.346]  The only problem with this is all the money goes to Rockefeller Soros and Goldman Sachs.
[02:00:52.346 --> 02:00:53.067]  All right, Webster.
[02:00:54.221 --> 02:01:05.227]  When we get back, we will break this all down in detail and finish up the story you're breaking down for us and then get into what's happened in Russia.
[02:01:05.227 --> 02:01:05.887]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:06.497 --> 02:01:08.458]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:01:08.458 --> 02:01:12.079]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:01:12.079 --> 02:01:14.519]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:01:14.519 --> 02:01:17.560]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:23.302]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:01:23.302 --> 02:01:27.203]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:01:27.543 --> 02:01:32.745]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:02:06.508 --> 02:02:08.109]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[02:02:08.109 --> 02:02:11.793]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[02:02:11.793 --> 02:02:15.617]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will
[02:02:15.677 --> 02:02:16.518]  Thanks for watching.
[02:02:35.359 --> 02:02:37.961]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[02:02:37.961 --> 02:02:43.264]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[02:02:43.264 --> 02:02:46.927]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[02:02:46.927 --> 02:02:49.729]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:52.490]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:54.412]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[02:02:54.412 --> 02:02:56.013]  Jesus is coming soon!

[02:03:06.119 --> 02:03:09.220]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:14.741]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:03:14.741 --> 02:03:20.442]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[02:03:31.004 --> 02:03:31.264]  Yes.

[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:23.183]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:23.183 --> 02:04:32.048]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:04:32.048 --> 02:04:36.150]  Webster, let's go through the detailed analysis from your perspective.
[02:04:37.259 --> 02:04:46.231]  On what happened with the Georgian sneak attack last Thursday night into Friday morning on the eve of the Olympic Games on 8-8-8.
[02:04:46.231 --> 02:04:51.178]  The Russians moving nuclear weapons in and repulsing the Georgian slash U.S.
[02:04:51.178 --> 02:04:52.320]  British Israeli attack.
[02:04:53.861 --> 02:04:56.625]  Uh, and what do you think this means geopolitically now?
[02:04:56.625 --> 02:05:08.241]  In the words of Lieutenant Colonel Sam Gardner, Air Force expert on these regions and that area, that region, and these type of weapon systems, the Russians undoubtedly brought nukes into the area and that they're stated
[02:05:08.821 --> 02:05:13.607]  Default position is to nuke with tactical weapons any U.S.
[02:05:13.607 --> 02:05:18.212]  forces that attack them with precision-guided conventional munitions.
[02:05:18.212 --> 02:05:23.298]  He called this the greatest military escalation in modern history since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:05:23.298 --> 02:05:27.883]  The neocons have been running around on TV, Crystal and others, saying they want war with Russia.
[02:05:28.463 --> 02:05:31.665]  The New York Times called it the beginning of what could be World War III.
[02:05:31.665 --> 02:05:37.769]  The Russians reportedly stopped attacking last night, but then the Georgians started shooting back at them.
[02:05:37.769 --> 02:05:38.989]  That's their tactic.
[02:05:38.989 --> 02:05:43.592]  Attack, and then when the Russians attack, scream bloody murder and say that they're being attacked.
[02:05:43.592 --> 02:05:49.135]  And I did hear a lady in a story yesterday talking about, did you hear about the Russians attacking Georgia in the U.S.?
[02:05:49.135 --> 02:05:53.658]  You have a public completely dumbed down, not knowing which end is up.
[02:05:53.658 --> 02:05:55.739]  I mean, how does this all play together?
[02:05:56.644 --> 02:06:02.086]  Well, I have tried to argue for the past eight or nine months.
[02:06:02.086 --> 02:06:05.407]  The situation in Washington, first of all, has fundamentally changed.
[02:06:05.407 --> 02:06:07.068]  The neocons are out.
[02:06:07.068 --> 02:06:08.188]  They have no power.
[02:06:08.188 --> 02:06:11.449]  We'll see why they're trying to get back on TV now.
[02:06:11.449 --> 02:06:13.810]  But the neocons have been broken as a faction.
[02:06:13.810 --> 02:06:18.412]  You've got Libby out, Rumsfeld out, Wolfowitz out, out at the World Bank.
[02:06:19.352 --> 02:06:24.476]  Lord Black, Lord Conrad Black, a top world neocon, is actually now in jail.
[02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:31.621]  You've got Ledeen under attack by the Rockefeller Committee for his activities with his old Iran Contra Network.
[02:06:31.621 --> 02:06:36.045]  So, the thing that you're facing now, I would not call it neocon anymore.
[02:06:36.045 --> 02:06:37.245]  It's not the neocons.
[02:06:37.245 --> 02:06:40.588]  It is the Rockefeller, Brzezinski, trilateral, Bilderberg,
[02:06:41.088 --> 02:06:43.789]  Okay, so that's who NATO and Israel are taking orders from.
[02:06:43.789 --> 02:06:45.710]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[02:06:45.710 --> 02:06:47.051]  That is who is running the U.S.
[02:06:47.051 --> 02:06:48.351]  government at this point.
[02:06:48.351 --> 02:06:51.173]  I understand that, Webster, but let me bring up this caveat.
[02:06:51.173 --> 02:07:00.797]  I mean, it's pretty darn neocon when you've got the military head of the Georgian military not even being Georgian, being an Israeli, and the foreign minister being an Israeli.
[02:07:00.797 --> 02:07:01.097]  Go ahead.
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:17.851]  Yeah, the point of this now is that the neocons are essentially a group of stragglers and fugitives that are tending to attach themselves to the Brzezinski machine, trying to save themselves and maintain their positions and their careers in this new era.
[02:07:17.851 --> 02:07:28.938]  But notice the emphasis, the epicenter of world confrontation has shifted radically out of the Middle East, out of the Persian Gulf, and to the borders of Russia,
[02:07:29.478 --> 02:07:37.168]  And also China, because the other thing, what I was actually looking for to happen on 8808 was some kind of a terror stunt at the Beijing Olympics.
[02:07:37.168 --> 02:07:45.559]  This could still happen, which could also then heat up the world, and I would urge people to be aware of that, and we can maybe talk about that in a minute.
[02:07:46.337 --> 02:07:51.982]  The kinds of things that you're seeing now are typical, classic Brzezinski.
[02:07:51.982 --> 02:07:56.346]  Remember, Brzezinski says, you can't attack these countries yourself.
[02:07:56.346 --> 02:07:58.668]  If you want to destroy Venezuela, you can't attack them.
[02:07:58.668 --> 02:08:00.109]  Do you use surrogates?
[02:08:00.109 --> 02:08:01.250]  Play Columbia.
[02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:02.811]  You want to destroy Somalia?
[02:08:02.811 --> 02:08:03.452]  Stay out of there.
[02:08:03.452 --> 02:08:04.873]  Let Ethiopia go in.
[02:08:04.873 --> 02:08:07.375]  In this case, he's got a little Hitler.
[02:08:07.375 --> 02:08:09.537]  Saakashvili is a little Hitler.
[02:08:09.537 --> 02:08:10.998]  Brzezinski.
[02:08:10.998 --> 02:08:13.881]  This process of the color revolution, the so-called
[02:08:14.881 --> 02:08:29.048]  And we'll go back to how they financed the takeover there, but did you see the video of a plane flies overhead and he starts cowering and crying and then running and then they cover him up with armored vests and he's like screaming like a little girl?
[02:08:29.048 --> 02:08:31.089]  I mean, I've never seen a leader act like that.
[02:08:31.089 --> 02:08:32.830]  An ultimate little coward.
[02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:35.331]  And he's wild-eyed and always lying.
[02:08:35.331 --> 02:08:36.492]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[02:08:37.393 --> 02:08:39.474]  I would compare him, in many ways, to Obama.
[02:08:39.474 --> 02:08:49.964]  A megalomaniac, drunk with power, indulging in illusions of infantile omnipotence, and really thinking... He probably... I believe that Brzezinski has played him.
[02:08:49.964 --> 02:08:56.390]  In other words, Brzezinski has promised him... Yeah, he told him he'd win, and not that it was really meant to bring Russia in and escalate things.
[02:08:56.670 --> 02:09:02.713]  And not that he was... You don't tell your expendable pawns that they are expendable pawns on a kamikaze trip.
[02:09:02.713 --> 02:09:03.993]  You don't tell them that.
[02:09:03.993 --> 02:09:05.874]  You let them go ahead and think that they're coming back.
[02:09:05.874 --> 02:09:16.278]  Now, a lot of analysts are saying, and it does seem to be true, that people see McCain as a stronger military leader, and that this Georgian-Russian crisis actually strengthens McCain's hand.
[02:09:16.278 --> 02:09:17.599]  Why would Brzezinski do that?
[02:09:17.599 --> 02:09:19.520]  Yeah, I think it may have happened too soon.
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:24.802]  The problem is when you're dealing with somebody as unstable as Saakashvili, he's also got to respond
[02:09:25.502 --> 02:09:32.967]  To his own internal conditions, one obvious fact, if you want to have an attack in that part of the world, you've got to do it during the summer.
[02:09:32.967 --> 02:09:36.289]  You can't do it during the autumn when the rains come.
[02:09:36.289 --> 02:09:39.491]  So, really, there are competing considerations.
[02:09:39.491 --> 02:09:45.014]  Our election is in November, but if they're going to attack this year, they've more or less got to do it now.
[02:09:45.014 --> 02:09:46.995]  There's a lot to be said about that.
[02:09:46.995 --> 02:09:51.038]  The principal idea, though, is that Georgia is the aggressor.
[02:09:51.038 --> 02:09:54.740]  They launched a genocidal sneak attack in the middle of the night.
[02:09:55.741 --> 02:10:15.795]  And CNN and Fox now confirmed showed video of the Georgians attacking South Ossetia and the gorge over by Abkhazia and then lied and said that was Russians doing it.
[02:10:15.795 --> 02:10:18.017]  I mean, this is unprecedented media lying.
[02:10:18.777 --> 02:10:25.742]  Yeah, it's probably the biggest media hysteria, but you can compare it to 9-11 or the Iraq War or Obama.
[02:10:25.742 --> 02:10:33.509]  It's the same media that have been telling you Obama is the savior are now telling you that Putin and Medvedev are the devils.
[02:10:33.509 --> 02:10:37.712]  The Russian response, of course, is then a powerful counter-stroke.
[02:10:38.252 --> 02:10:45.653]  And they've got to destroy the Georgian second echelon, in other words, the second attack wave that would have come in there.
[02:10:45.653 --> 02:10:52.955]  Yeah, the main forces that were built up to come in behind the shock troops, now... And the military infrastructure all over the country.
[02:10:52.955 --> 02:10:54.355]  Let me just comment on this.
[02:10:54.355 --> 02:10:56.075]  This is largely built up by the U.S.
[02:10:56.075 --> 02:11:05.477]  With your tax dollars, this tin-pot little Hitler, Saakashvili... Increase their defense budget by 30-plus times in five years, but I want to stop there because I want to go back and then you can go forward.
[02:11:05.797 --> 02:11:09.219]  But I want to cover every point here and get here and take Webster.
[02:11:09.219 --> 02:11:22.346]  Dealing with this, do you think Brzezinski and the Anglo-American establishment and the neocon followers, and I agree with you, they're now like the birdcage line are being removed, new ones being put in as a front for the oligarchs.
[02:11:22.346 --> 02:11:24.988]  Do you think they miscalculated or is this what they expected?
[02:11:25.675 --> 02:11:28.017]  I think they've miscalculated the timing.
[02:11:28.017 --> 02:11:35.305]  However, remember, on the McCain side, you've also got a tentacle of Brzezinski, and indeed, also in the U.S.
[02:11:35.305 --> 02:11:36.146]  government.
[02:11:36.146 --> 02:11:38.548]  Ian Brzezinski is the other son.
[02:11:38.548 --> 02:11:40.250]  He has three kids.
[02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:44.094]  Mark Brzezinski, Clinton National Security Council, works for Obama.
[02:11:44.634 --> 02:11:50.876]  Mika Brzezinski, you see her every morning, this airhead with Scarborough on Morning Joe, MSNBC.
[02:11:50.876 --> 02:11:59.118]  But then we have Ian Brzezinski, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon for NATO and Eastern Europe.
[02:11:59.118 --> 02:12:02.319]  He is undoubtedly one of the people who got this thing going.
[02:12:02.879 --> 02:12:08.101]  Ian Brzezinski, and of course he's also a top advisor to McCain.
[02:12:08.101 --> 02:12:14.104]  So in a certain way, between McCain and Brzezinski, and Obama, you're going to get Brzezinski anyway.
[02:12:14.104 --> 02:12:19.666]  The difference, of course, is that with Obama as the face of imperialism, as we saw in Berlin,
[02:12:20.246 --> 02:12:26.329]  Obama basically says, I can get you the European troops and the European money, that with McCain you can't get.
[02:12:26.329 --> 02:12:29.230]  That's right, he can sell the suckers one more time.
[02:12:29.230 --> 02:12:36.973]  Right, and he can get the Europeans to go and die in an apocalyptic war against Russia, whereas McCain's chances of doing that are inferior.
[02:12:36.973 --> 02:12:45.957]  Also, Obama's going to be a better strike-breaker than McCain, because he'll do it with left cover, and he can even use his goons, which even somebody like Clinton does not have.
[02:12:45.957 --> 02:12:49.238]  She does not have an army of goons in the way that Obama does.
[02:12:49.258 --> 02:12:52.700]  I want to continue with Obama, but let's get back into Russia.
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:13:01.306]  I mean, this was a very dangerous, reckless move by the oligarchs, by the New World Order, to do this.
[02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:01.967]  Certainly.
[02:13:01.967 --> 02:13:05.369]  Let's just look at the ways this could escalate into World War III.
[02:13:05.369 --> 02:13:14.195]  One obvious one is, you've got these 2,000 Georgian troops that have gone into Iraq at the behest of the U.S., and they wanted to go back to Georgia.
[02:13:14.195 --> 02:13:16.617]  Now, I would say to them, fine, do it on your own power.
[02:13:17.257 --> 02:13:19.418]  Uh, but no, we've had C-17 U.S.
[02:13:19.418 --> 02:13:21.979]  Air Force transports ferrying them back.
[02:13:21.979 --> 02:13:27.120]  Now, this is a very unfriendly act towards, uh, uh, the Russians.
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:31.382]  Putin is complaining... He started two days ago bringing them into a hot battle zone.
[02:13:31.382 --> 02:13:34.743]  Right, and, and, according to NBC News, there were contacts between
[02:13:35.143 --> 02:13:35.563]  I don't know.
[02:13:51.989 --> 02:13:53.429]  It's difficult to know how many.
[02:13:53.429 --> 02:13:58.090]  At least 125 or maybe several hundred U.S.
[02:13:58.090 --> 02:14:03.812]  advisers are attached to the Georgian Defense Ministry to go with all of this hardware that the U.S.
[02:14:03.812 --> 02:14:09.733]  has been pouring in to Georgia, which the Russians, I hope, have now largely destroyed.
[02:14:09.733 --> 02:14:12.193]  But the possibility of some of those U.S.
[02:14:12.193 --> 02:14:18.895]  advisers getting killed and then a huge media spectacle around that has got to be factored in.
[02:14:18.895 --> 02:14:19.495]  Another point.
[02:14:20.055 --> 02:14:27.517]  The Black Sea, the Russians have put up a naval blockade on the Georgian ports in the Black Sea.
[02:14:27.517 --> 02:14:35.879]  Suppose the US, the British, the French, or the Ukrainian hotheads, also possible, or Romania, Bulgaria, we don't know.
[02:14:35.879 --> 02:14:37.540]  Those are now NATO states, right?
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:41.281]  Poland and the Balkans are basically in NATO.
[02:14:41.921 --> 02:14:53.749]  If they try to run the blockade, break the Russian blockade, and deliver ammunition, or even humanitarian, they would say, but really ammunition, I'm sure, then that could lead to an international incident.
[02:14:53.749 --> 02:14:56.511]  A Lusitanian-type deal, or Gulf of Tonkin?
[02:14:56.511 --> 02:15:05.497]  It would be, I guess, a Cuban missile crisis in reverse, because the Russians would be there with a picket line, and if you don't stop, and you don't submit to a search, they're going to blow you up.
[02:15:05.497 --> 02:15:06.598]  Now, here's the most dangerous.
[02:15:07.694 --> 02:15:21.109]  Not only is Saakashvili and this Georgian regime, the product of people power coup, color revolution, in this case it's the Roses Revolution, run by Brzezinski, financed by Soros, National Endowment for Democracy.
[02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:22.570]  Call this the Left CIA.
[02:15:22.570 --> 02:15:24.052]  This is something you haven't seen that much.
[02:15:24.472 --> 02:15:27.575]  Well, you've seen it, but it hasn't been prominent internally.
[02:15:27.575 --> 02:15:34.040]  If you go to Ukraine, the group in Kiev, Yushchenko and Tymoshenko, the ice princess, right?
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:36.902]  This blonde with her braided blonde hair.
[02:15:36.902 --> 02:15:37.883]  She's a kleptocrat.
[02:15:37.883 --> 02:15:40.665]  She's a NATO agent and a kleptocrat.
[02:15:40.665 --> 02:15:42.867]  The Ukrainians are supporting Georgia.
[02:15:42.867 --> 02:15:46.290]  Now you've got one of these two Kaczynski twins in Poland.
[02:15:46.994 --> 02:15:56.306]  ...and what they've got is a front of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Ukraine... ...starting similar conflicts.
[02:15:56.306 --> 02:15:59.209]  This could only be the start of a larger brushfire war.
[02:15:59.209 --> 02:15:59.670]  Stay with us.
[02:16:03.806 --> 02:16:05.267]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:16:05.267 --> 02:16:11.310]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:12.131]  That's right.
[02:16:12.131 --> 02:16:15.472]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:16:15.472 --> 02:16:22.156]  Finally recognize the value of real silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[02:16:22.156 --> 02:16:24.137]  Yet no word about IRAs.
[02:16:24.137 --> 02:16:28.940]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:35.422]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:16:35.422 --> 02:16:39.943]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:16:39.943 --> 02:16:40.243]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:16:40.243 --> 02:16:42.203]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:16:42.203 --> 02:16:42.523]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:16:42.523 --> 02:16:43.063]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:55.669 --> 02:17:01.371]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:17:01.371 --> 02:17:02.691]  And we knew what to do.
[02:17:02.691 --> 02:17:04.692]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:17:04.692 --> 02:17:11.733]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:17:11.733 --> 02:17:16.895]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[02:17:17.867 --> 02:17:20.628]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[02:17:20.628 --> 02:17:27.732]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:17:27.732 --> 02:17:30.913]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:17:30.913 --> 02:17:36.676]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:17:36.676 --> 02:17:39.257]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:17:39.737 --> 02:17:45.801]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:17:45.801 --> 02:17:48.723]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:17:48.723 --> 02:17:55.146]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:17:55.146 --> 02:17:58.148]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:17:58.148 --> 02:18:02.451]  Did you know that our founding fathers gave us a republican form of government?
[02:18:02.451 --> 02:18:06.273]  Why is all you ever hear from our leaders is that we're a democracy?

[02:18:19.284 --> 02:18:28.469]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:33.591]  Have you ever been told the truth about why Russian Communism seemingly has fallen?
[02:18:33.591 --> 02:18:36.453]  Why did our government let Mikhail Gorbachev come here?

[02:18:42.961 --> 02:18:46.483]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[02:18:46.483 --> 02:18:52.327]  American Free Press, the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[02:19:03.926 --> 02:19:05.648]  American Free Press.
[02:19:05.648 --> 02:19:08.651]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[02:19:08.651 --> 02:19:11.413]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[02:19:11.413 --> 02:19:14.436]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[02:19:14.436 --> 02:19:16.699]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[02:19:16.699 --> 02:19:18.981]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[02:19:19.796 --> 02:19:27.825]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head-on.
[02:19:27.825 --> 02:19:32.070]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.

[02:19:38.777 --> 02:19:40.058]  AmericanFreePress.net
[02:19:41.164 --> 02:19:42.847]  It's just like it sounds.
[02:19:42.847 --> 02:19:46.292]  American Free Press, all one word, dot net.
[02:19:46.292 --> 02:19:49.637]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:19:49.637 --> 02:19:54.024]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[02:20:19.726 --> 02:20:41.012]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron And your breath as hard as kerosene You weren't your mama's only boy But her favorite one it seemed
[02:20:42.688 --> 02:20:45.329]  Well, Mr. Darby is our guest today.
[02:20:45.329 --> 02:20:50.752]  Your calls are coming up in about 35 minutes.
[02:20:50.752 --> 02:20:54.554]  You can talk about any subject you want with our guest, any other issue.
[02:21:11.347 --> 02:21:19.632]  Okay, we've gotten into the third and, what you were saying, most dangerous scenario with these now NATO or sub-NATO states.
[02:21:19.632 --> 02:21:28.017]  They all have different ethnic partitions right along the borders with Russia proper, Mother Russia.
[02:21:28.775 --> 02:21:33.356]  Perfect to start these Balkanization, divide and conquer conflicts.
[02:21:33.356 --> 02:21:34.257]  Continue.
[02:21:34.257 --> 02:21:38.098]  Of the ones that I've mentioned, Poland is a full member of NATO.
[02:21:38.098 --> 02:21:39.498]  This should never have been done.
[02:21:39.498 --> 02:21:44.800]  The Polish regime is a collection of anti-Russian hotheads.
[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:47.803]  Uh, created in the image of Brzezinski.
[02:21:47.803 --> 02:22:00.235]  Brzezinski even says that he considered going back to Poland in the late 1990s and becoming president of the country and leading the anti- I'm adding this now, leading the anti-Russian assault.
[02:22:00.675 --> 02:22:01.135]  I think so.
[02:22:22.152 --> 02:22:25.734]  Because, look at this, when you have these clashes, right?
[02:22:25.734 --> 02:22:26.714]  The U.S.
[02:22:26.714 --> 02:22:28.735]  advisors on the ground in Georgia, U.S.
[02:22:28.735 --> 02:22:30.556]  ships in the Black Sea, U.S.
[02:22:30.556 --> 02:22:34.038]  planes coming in, ferrying in military supplies.
[02:22:34.038 --> 02:22:36.999]  You go immediately to superpower confrontation.
[02:22:36.999 --> 02:22:42.762]  You immediately have intercontinental ballistic missiles ready to go, H-bombs on them.
[02:22:42.762 --> 02:22:44.742]  This may or may not happen in the near future.
[02:22:44.742 --> 02:22:48.904]  It's no longer toying with Arabs, you're genociding and slaughtering who are fighting you with AK-47s.
[02:22:50.685 --> 02:22:52.908]  You're not dealing with defenseless states, right?
[02:22:52.908 --> 02:23:03.258]  Iran, of course, is not defenseless in the sense that it can project power to the Persian Gulf and maybe cut off the world's oil supply, but there's virtually no way they can strike into the United States.
[02:23:03.258 --> 02:23:06.241]  Now, with Russia, and indeed with China, this is totally different.
[02:23:06.241 --> 02:23:09.684]  I would urge people to mobilize on this issue.
[02:23:09.684 --> 02:23:11.566]  We cannot have any U.S.
[02:23:11.566 --> 02:23:13.969]  money, soldiers, aid,
[02:23:14.929 --> 02:23:17.010]  Stop this diplomatic support.
[02:23:17.010 --> 02:23:28.156]  Let me point out, in addition to the bellicose nonsense that you've heard from McCain, you know, he wants to kick the Russians out of the group of eight, and he looks into Putin's eyes and sees KGB.
[02:23:28.156 --> 02:23:30.557]  That's all very witty, I'm sure.
[02:23:30.557 --> 02:23:37.461]  Notice that Obama says he wants Georgia to become a NATO full member.
[02:23:37.461 --> 02:23:43.924]  So Obama, having seen the insanity of his fellow Brzezinski puppet, Saakashvili, the little Hitler,
[02:23:44.875 --> 02:23:57.381]  Obama says, yes, let's put the entire weight of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US, Canada, Turkey, and all these Europeans, let's throw that into the scales behind a lunatic like Saakashvili.
[02:23:57.381 --> 02:23:59.322]  This disqualifies Obama.
[02:23:59.322 --> 02:24:07.366]  Obama also says the Russians have violated the sovereignty of Georgia and encroached on the sovereignty of Georgia.
[02:24:07.366 --> 02:24:10.487]  No, Senator, that's called hot pursuit.
[02:24:10.487 --> 02:24:11.788]  As soon as those Georgians
[02:24:12.848 --> 02:24:18.069]  Murdered 2,000 civilians in the night of the 8th and the 9th.
[02:24:18.069 --> 02:24:23.591]  At that point, the countermeasures of the Russians are pure self-defense under the U.N.
[02:24:23.591 --> 02:24:24.311]  Charter.
[02:24:24.311 --> 02:24:25.511]  That's allowed under the U.N.
[02:24:25.511 --> 02:24:26.351]  Charter.
[02:24:26.351 --> 02:24:31.192]  And it becomes hot pursuit because you're chasing people that are trying to kill you.
[02:24:31.192 --> 02:24:36.854]  Yeah, they couldn't run the main armies out and then let them regroup, which they were doing, for a counter-assault.
[02:24:36.854 --> 02:24:38.674]  Once they were routed, they had to destroy them.
[02:24:39.054 --> 02:24:48.318]  Yes, and remember that Saakashvili, this tin-pot little Hitler, he tried the same thing back in 2004, and he was defeated.
[02:24:48.318 --> 02:24:50.999]  Also remember, he's not democratic at all.
[02:24:50.999 --> 02:24:53.440]  There was a large mass movement against him.
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:58.042]  It was basically a color revolution in reverse, this time with real popular support.
[02:24:58.622 --> 02:25:07.286]  And, uh, Saakashvili immediately declared martial law, shut down the TV, kicked out the foreign journalists, and rounded up the opposition.
[02:25:07.286 --> 02:25:09.407]  Yeah, he really tortured and killed them with U.S.
[02:25:09.407 --> 02:25:10.527]  support.
[02:25:10.527 --> 02:25:15.250]  They even used Georgia, reportedly, as a black site to take some of the torture victims to.
[02:25:15.250 --> 02:25:17.511]  They're full NATO puppets.
[02:25:17.511 --> 02:25:22.513]  Now, the Russian position, of course, is that South Ossetians are Russian citizens.
[02:25:23.033 --> 02:25:26.756]  So you've killed 2,000 Russian citizens and several dozen of their troops.
[02:25:26.756 --> 02:25:28.637]  It's comparable to 9-11.
[02:25:28.637 --> 02:25:31.519]  By the way, the number's going up, as you know, Webster.
[02:25:31.519 --> 02:25:34.461]  They're now digging a bunch of people out of the rubble.
[02:25:34.461 --> 02:25:37.123]  So it's gonna be more than 2,000 dead civilians.
[02:25:37.123 --> 02:25:39.304]  Webster, Tarpley, stay with us.
[02:25:39.304 --> 02:25:45.788]  We're gonna go to break, come back, continue with this, then get into the social Darwinism, what drives the evil minds.
[02:25:45.788 --> 02:25:47.169]  We're on the march.
[02:25:47.169 --> 02:25:49.691]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:25:49.691 --> 02:25:52.393]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:25:55.484 --> 02:25:58.909]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:25:58.909 --> 02:26:01.232]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:26:01.232 --> 02:26:04.536]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:26:04.536 --> 02:26:11.425]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:26:11.425 --> 02:26:13.528]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:26:14.008 --> 02:26:17.309]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:22.091]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:26:22.091 --> 02:26:26.033]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:26:26.033 --> 02:26:27.654]  Travel less, meet online.

[02:26:38.918 --> 02:26:39.439]  A new world order.
[02:26:39.439 --> 02:26:42.300]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:27:04.835 --> 02:27:07.676]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:27:07.676 --> 02:27:10.457]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:27:10.457 --> 02:27:13.639]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:27:13.639 --> 02:27:20.962]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:27:23.985 --> 02:27:29.449]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:27:29.449 --> 02:27:33.311]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:35.873]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:27:35.873 --> 02:27:37.054]  Most people have no idea.
[02:27:37.054 --> 02:27:37.834]  They're not after money.
[02:27:37.834 --> 02:27:39.095]  They have all the money they need.
[02:27:39.095 --> 02:27:40.076]  They're after power.
[02:27:40.076 --> 02:27:41.237]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:28:39.966 --> 02:28:41.867]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[02:29:16.838 --> 02:29:22.482]  Bottom line, we have an out-of-control elite who play with the world like it's their little toy.
[02:29:22.482 --> 02:29:25.865]  Am I saying Putin's good?
[02:29:25.865 --> 02:29:38.935]  No, he was caught staging bombings in 1999 so that he could create political support to come into office under a popular war with the Chechens, backed by, again, the United States.
[02:29:40.347 --> 02:29:45.010]  You always find the Muslim extremists on a very short leash to this government.
[02:29:45.010 --> 02:29:52.556]  That's why it's so sick that they use them as cover, as decoys, in the drills for the 9-11 attacks.
[02:29:52.556 --> 02:29:54.558]  Webster Tarpley, let me bring this up.
[02:29:54.558 --> 02:30:08.628]  How, if Brzezinski and the Rand Corporation and the Rockefeller clan, mimicking what the British had done in the region at the turn of the last century, creating most of the nations in the Middle East, their modern borders,
[02:30:09.324 --> 02:30:26.242]  If they've always been used as a shield to overthrow democratically elected governments, intellectual governments, even pro-Western governments, but that won't be puppets, they use Muslim radicals to overthrow countries, then they then fight with the Muslim radicals they've put in, you know, kind of this endless crises creation.
[02:30:27.343 --> 02:30:37.628]  How do you see them using the Muslims that they've used again against the Serbs in the late 90s against in the in the 80s against the Russians?
[02:30:37.628 --> 02:30:44.310]  Brzezinski six months before in 79 having them attack Russian outposts in the north of Afghanistan getting a Russian response.
[02:30:44.310 --> 02:30:46.671]  How do you see the Muslims, i.e.
[02:30:46.671 --> 02:30:47.792]  mainly the Wahhabist,
[02:30:48.733 --> 02:30:55.457]  The Muslim majority, the 80%, Sunni, how do you see them being used on the chessboard?
[02:30:55.457 --> 02:30:55.918]  Who are they?
[02:30:55.918 --> 02:30:59.400]  Are they a rook or are they just a pawn?
[02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:03.803]  Brzezinski is the father of modern Islamic fundamentalism.
[02:31:03.803 --> 02:31:14.351]  He argued, pardon me, in the Carter administration that Muslim, pardon me, fundamentalism was the great bulwark against Soviet
[02:31:15.231 --> 02:31:16.112]  Communism.
[02:31:16.112 --> 02:31:17.773]  He installed Khomeini.
[02:31:17.773 --> 02:31:19.354]  He created Khomeini.
[02:31:19.354 --> 02:31:22.296]  Khomeini was a well-known, long-term British agent.
[02:31:22.296 --> 02:31:25.419]  Had been used against the Shah during the Shah's White Revolution.
[02:31:25.419 --> 02:31:26.640]  Let's spend some time on that.
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:28.021]  I'm gonna sit back.
[02:31:28.021 --> 02:31:32.644]  Let's spend some time on that because I've researched that for the listeners that are probably believing that.
[02:31:32.644 --> 02:31:34.365]  That is true.
[02:31:34.365 --> 02:31:35.626]  Let's go back to 53.
[02:31:35.626 --> 02:31:41.831]  Let's explain the run-up to 79 and the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic State being shut up.
[02:31:43.064 --> 02:31:59.100]  Well, Muzadek would belong, along with General Qasem of Iraq and Nasser of Egypt and any number of others, to the wave of progressive, nationalistic, military types in the Arab world, and it would have been in the interest of the United States
[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:05.767]  To cooperate with them for the modernization of the region and the ending of colonialism and imperialism.
[02:32:05.767 --> 02:32:15.960]  And this would be, even in the Eisenhower administration, the Suez Policy of 1956, turning against the British, the French, and the Israelis, in favor of the Arabs.
[02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:17.081]  That's what got the U.S.
[02:32:17.081 --> 02:32:19.504]  into the Middle East in any positive way.
[02:32:20.527 --> 02:32:32.876]  In the first place, but the overthrow of Mossadegh is a joint operation of the British with Alan Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, and the pro-Wall Street CIA forces.
[02:32:32.876 --> 02:32:35.138]  And the father of Norman Schwarzkopf.
[02:32:35.138 --> 02:32:36.099]  Yes, right, that too.
[02:32:38.064 --> 02:32:39.125]  Here's the thing.
[02:32:39.125 --> 02:32:42.027]  The Shah, the problem of the Shah is this.
[02:32:42.027 --> 02:32:44.808]  He had some positive features in the 1960s.
[02:32:44.808 --> 02:32:46.790]  Let me mention this white revolution.
[02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:51.533]  The mullahs of Iran are an expression of the latifundists, the huge landowners.
[02:32:51.533 --> 02:32:53.014]  They're a kind of a feudal class.
[02:32:53.014 --> 02:32:56.276]  They're a little bit like this feudal monster we have, the Dalai Lama.
[02:32:56.836 --> 02:33:00.158]  Running around today that the Hollywood people think is spiritual.
[02:33:00.158 --> 02:33:10.983]  The Shah had this thing called the White Revolution, which was to break up the huge latifundia and actually have a land reform, and to try to actually advance the country.
[02:33:10.983 --> 02:33:14.525]  Now this was his last attempt in that regard.
[02:33:14.525 --> 02:33:17.827]  But Khomeini was deployed as a British agent.
[02:33:17.827 --> 02:33:22.309]  The idea in Iran was scratch a mullah and you'll find a British agent.
[02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:23.310]  That's basically correct.
[02:33:23.810 --> 02:33:24.371]  We're good to go.
[02:33:53.810 --> 02:33:54.451]  We're good to go.
[02:34:14.034 --> 02:34:23.100]  Into the modern age with nuclear energy, steel mills, petrochemical, new airport, new subway system for Tehran, the port of Bandar Abbas.
[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:36.588]  My entree into this was, I knew that this guy, Loris Corbi of Italy, one of the great civil engineering companies of the world, who was building this new city of Bandar Abbas, now Bandar Khomeini.
[02:34:36.588 --> 02:34:39.630]  When Khomeini came in, he shut down all of this.
[02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:41.091]  The Iranians would have long since
[02:34:41.631 --> 02:34:42.252]  We're good to go.
[02:34:58.247 --> 02:35:01.411]  Yeah, for those that don't know, let's flesh that out now, Sam.
[02:35:01.411 --> 02:35:05.655]  He brags in two of his books that they helped Pol Pot and helped him kill two million people.
[02:35:05.655 --> 02:35:06.917]  He should be immediately arrested.
[02:35:06.917 --> 02:35:08.418]  This isn't us saying this.
[02:35:08.418 --> 02:35:13.404]  He writes this and says that, you know, we let him kill two million people and supported him and I'm proud of what I did.
[02:35:13.404 --> 02:35:16.247]  I can pull the quote up, but that's basically what he said.
[02:35:16.827 --> 02:35:40.191]  I mean, this is just the amazing type activity, but I want to cover Pol Pot briefly, then I want to go back to 1979-1980, then this staged deal with the, quote, Republicans, doing a deal to have him grab hostages, then stage an event, but you have Brzezinski in the White House, why would he then double back and betray Carter if you're saying he's the mastermind?
[02:35:40.191 --> 02:35:44.312]  I know he's a fellow traveler and very powerful, but then, you know, Bern,
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:58.247]  The Carter administration which he ran and sat in via the Reagan administration with the Muslim Islamic Revolution over there for the weapons.
[02:35:58.247 --> 02:36:04.671]  Now remember Brzezinski believed that Islamic fundamentalism is the number one bulwark against Soviet communism.
[02:36:04.671 --> 02:36:06.992]  So he foments that in Iran.
[02:36:06.992 --> 02:36:09.413]  That's where the whole thing begins really.
[02:36:09.413 --> 02:36:15.457]  And then he sends in these teams into Afghanistan as you said to get the Soviets in there and begin to bring them down.
[02:36:16.403 --> 02:36:22.508]  Um, Brzezinski fundamentally believes that he can use the Khomeini regime against the Soviets.
[02:36:22.508 --> 02:36:36.098]  This is the problem you have when you have a policy of what might be called appeasement, but really of turning these other countries into kamikaze puppets, suicidal pawns, expendable assets against your bigger enemy.
[02:36:36.098 --> 02:36:39.080]  That's the end of the Brzezinski method, right?
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:42.462]  You know, you point them at the Russians and let them go.
[02:36:42.462 --> 02:36:44.003]  This cannot be allowed in public.
[02:36:45.024 --> 02:36:52.609]  Brzezinski wanted to arm Khomeini, but he couldn't do it in public, and he needed a cover story.
[02:36:52.609 --> 02:37:01.934]  So he encouraged, in my view, encouraged the taking of the hostages as a piece of political theater that would allow him to continue U.S.
[02:37:01.934 --> 02:37:06.057]  military deliveries to Iran, and that's what is called Iran-Contra.
[02:37:06.656 --> 02:37:08.117]  It started under Carter.
[02:37:08.117 --> 02:37:08.677]  The U.S.
[02:37:08.677 --> 02:37:11.398]  military deliveries to Iran never stopped.
[02:37:11.398 --> 02:37:20.863]  There's a guy called Stanley Pottinger who was involved, and the Brzezinski National Security Council, where they had Iranian representatives.
[02:37:20.863 --> 02:37:23.805]  The so-called captain, say, today, was operating out of the U.S.
[02:37:23.805 --> 02:37:24.185]  Navy.
[02:37:24.185 --> 02:37:24.965]  And so the power never changes.
[02:37:24.965 --> 02:37:26.046]  They just remove a figurehead.
[02:37:27.088 --> 02:37:34.511]  Yes, but again, it's part of this, the question is that you're trying to subvert those five critical republics in Central Asia.
[02:37:34.511 --> 02:37:40.973]  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, right?
[02:37:40.973 --> 02:37:44.474]  The five big Soviet Central Asian republics.
[02:37:44.474 --> 02:37:45.335]  That's your target.
[02:37:46.696 --> 02:37:52.640]  No, Brzezinski, therefore, has a public policy, and then he has the real policy.
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:38:00.705]  If you think about the accusation of appeasement against Obama, it's accurate, as long as you know what appeasement is.
[02:38:00.705 --> 02:38:06.028]  You can imagine Obama acting as a puppet for Brzezinski, talking to the Iranians.
[02:38:06.028 --> 02:38:09.510]  He would say, your real enemy is the Russians, not us.
[02:38:10.481 --> 02:38:13.743]  You've got to oppose the Russians in the Caspian Sea.
[02:38:13.743 --> 02:38:16.524]  You need a navy in the Caspian Sea.
[02:38:16.524 --> 02:38:22.407]  We'll give you a navy in the Caspian Sea so you can stop those Russians from taking your oil.
[02:38:22.407 --> 02:38:24.148]  You want nuclear weapons?
[02:38:24.148 --> 02:38:25.589]  We'll give them to you.
[02:38:25.589 --> 02:38:27.030]  We have special nukes.
[02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:28.451]  They only go to Moscow.
[02:38:28.451 --> 02:38:29.631]  You want some of those?
[02:38:29.631 --> 02:38:30.992]  We'll give you some right away.
[02:38:30.992 --> 02:38:34.634]  There is no objection by Brzezinski to Iran as a nuclear power.
[02:38:35.574 --> 02:38:42.341]  How did Pakistan's armament, and by the US and England, how does that play into this larger chessboard?
[02:38:42.341 --> 02:38:44.924]  I don't know if that's quite so connected.
[02:38:44.924 --> 02:38:50.149]  I think the US, what you say is true, that's how AQ Khan was working for the
[02:38:50.769 --> 02:38:51.489]  For the U.S.
[02:38:51.489 --> 02:38:59.913]  all along, but again, the Iranian one is the really big one, because Pakistan has to be destroyed because the geopolitical instinct is pro-Chinese.
[02:38:59.913 --> 02:39:06.516]  Iran can be used as a puppet because the geopolitical instinct, as I've argued, is anti-Russian.
[02:39:06.516 --> 02:39:11.038]  So Brzezinski would say to them, look, didn't I arm you under Iran-Contra?
[02:39:11.038 --> 02:39:12.539]  Didn't I give you everything you needed?
[02:39:13.024 --> 02:39:13.665]  Yes.
[02:39:13.665 --> 02:39:15.886]  Well then, let me do it again for you now.
[02:39:15.886 --> 02:39:22.311]  I can deliver everything you need under the table, but let's get you going against those nasty Russians.
[02:39:22.311 --> 02:39:24.753]  Ahmadinejad will be out by next year.
[02:39:24.753 --> 02:39:27.996]  There's a new power constellation.
[02:39:27.996 --> 02:39:30.798]  This is what Obama would talk about.
[02:39:30.798 --> 02:39:32.880]  The neocon, say, bomb Iran.
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:38.086]  Brzezinski, with Obama, says, no, talk to Iran, but destroy Pakistan.
[02:39:38.086 --> 02:39:49.382]  Remember, Obama is... Well, that's the same more subtle system that we see growing out of Carter and then being implemented by the Reagan, really the Bush White House, the Bush 41-42 White House.
[02:39:52.072 --> 02:39:52.513]  Yeah, right.
[02:39:52.513 --> 02:39:54.315]  Because what we're dealing with is with Iraq.
[02:39:54.315 --> 02:39:56.177]  I mean, I want to get your analysis on this.
[02:39:56.177 --> 02:39:56.697]  Same thing.
[02:39:56.697 --> 02:39:57.819]  They arm Iraq.
[02:39:57.819 --> 02:39:58.900]  Tens of billions of dollars.
[02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:00.261]  Have them attack Iran.
[02:40:00.261 --> 02:40:02.824]  Then they tear each other up.
[02:40:02.824 --> 02:40:06.248]  And then you have the whole region descend down into another level.
[02:40:07.006 --> 02:40:10.950]  Yeah, I have a whole chapter on the Carter administration, about a 40-page summary.
[02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:17.837]  People can't remember what a horror, how horrendous it was under the Carter-Brezhinski-Volker regime.
[02:40:17.837 --> 02:40:22.242]  It was one of the qualitative turning points in American history.
[02:40:22.242 --> 02:40:26.266]  Concerning what you've just mentioned, the Iraq-Iran war, now here's the problem.
[02:40:26.266 --> 02:40:28.769]  Brezhinski installs Khomeini.
[02:40:29.449 --> 02:40:32.411]  The Shah is driven out by Carter and Brzezinski.
[02:40:32.411 --> 02:40:33.832]  They stab him in the back.
[02:40:33.832 --> 02:40:41.618]  At that point, there's a military government or Bakhtiar, a reasonable kind of... The Shah dies of a 24-hour cancer.
[02:40:41.618 --> 02:40:52.686]  ...government, and then they essentially then... Khomeini comes in, and when Khomeini shuts down all the development projects, because they're, you know, not Islamic in his view,
[02:40:53.526 --> 02:40:54.927]  The country begins to fall apart.
[02:40:54.927 --> 02:40:57.728]  Now, they realize that Khomeini is going to be out within six months.
[02:40:57.728 --> 02:41:04.890]  The only way to stabilize Khomeini is to go to Saddam Hussein and say, if you attack, you'll have an easy victory.
[02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:08.311]  So you play Saddam Hussein against Iran.
[02:41:08.311 --> 02:41:10.672]  This leads to a war that goes on for the best part of the decade.
[02:41:10.672 --> 02:41:14.793]  Knowing that that will create nationalism and will actually strengthen the Islamic Revolution.
[02:41:14.793 --> 02:41:16.654]  It will keep Khomeini in power.
[02:41:16.654 --> 02:41:18.755]  Now, all of this on Brzezinski's watch.
[02:41:18.755 --> 02:41:22.056]  So you've got the Soviet-Afghan War unleashed by the Russians.
[02:41:22.116 --> 02:41:23.917]  That's really what the neocons have been doing.
[02:41:23.917 --> 02:41:29.459]  Saber-rattling has made Iran more hardline and made the government more popular to the point where they were about to topple.
[02:41:29.459 --> 02:41:39.524]  Well, I would say there was a serious last-ditch attempt by Cheney to bomb Iran, most likely with nuclear weapons, last August-September.
[02:41:39.524 --> 02:41:41.585]  That was the rogue B-52.
[02:41:41.585 --> 02:41:45.087]  He tried as hard as he could, and he came within a hair's breadth.
[02:41:45.087 --> 02:41:49.749]  But we just learned that they're trying to paint up the PT boats and have a conflict over there.
[02:41:50.817 --> 02:41:52.578]  I don't see an attack on Iran.
[02:41:52.578 --> 02:41:53.538]  I would rule it out.
[02:41:53.538 --> 02:41:54.079]  The U.S.
[02:41:54.079 --> 02:41:58.821]  and the British do not want it, and the Israelis seem to have bought into the new strategy.
[02:41:58.821 --> 02:42:08.546]  In other words, their prominence in the Georgian picture indicates to me that the Israelis have seen that there will be no attack on Iran.
[02:42:08.546 --> 02:42:12.248]  There is, however, an attack on Pakistan going on right now.
[02:42:12.248 --> 02:42:17.271]  We've got the other side of it, the Turkmenistan Islamic Party.
[02:42:17.971 --> 02:42:24.637]  Is a puppet group of patsies in Chinese Turkestan, Xinjiang province, right, the northwest of China.
[02:42:24.637 --> 02:42:30.181]  Who have now suddenly started rattling sabers and delivering their videos to the CIA front intel center.
[02:42:30.181 --> 02:42:44.894]  Right, and they are, they run probably through the Pakistani ISI or maybe directly, right, Joseph Dubsky has an interesting article about this, but the idea is that terrorism in China is also being stoked with Tibetans
[02:42:45.882 --> 02:42:49.028]  With these Turkmen, or basically, they're all Turks.
[02:42:49.028 --> 02:42:53.777]  They're all Muslim Turks between the Caspian Sea and Mongolia, Tibet.
[02:42:53.777 --> 02:42:55.360]  It's a Turkish area, largely.
[02:42:56.255 --> 02:42:57.756]  Tajikistan, I guess, is the exception.
[02:42:57.756 --> 02:43:11.600]  So there are a whole bunch of Muslim Turks, and they can be used now, along with the Tibetans, and along with the democracy freaks, the Amnesty International human rights watch crew, to try to destabilize the government of China.
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:16.122]  But now, let's also think, what's the new face of false flag terrorism?
[02:43:16.122 --> 02:43:23.864]  Let me suggest, I was in Amsterdam, Holland, a couple of weeks ago, the Docs on the Docs series, and I showed a bunch of pictures.
[02:43:23.864 --> 02:43:25.665]  Let's see what the new face of terrorism is.
[02:43:26.448 --> 02:43:28.690]  Cho at Virginia Tech.
[02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:32.153]  You look at him, well he's Korean, but he might be Chinese.
[02:43:32.153 --> 02:43:35.735]  So he's a crazy oriental Korean.
[02:43:35.735 --> 02:43:37.537]  He's not a Manchurian candidate.
[02:43:37.537 --> 02:43:43.902]  And now in the middle of the Olympics you have a Chinese guy killing two people and it's hyped like aliens have landed.
[02:43:43.902 --> 02:43:45.723]  But Cho is one.
[02:43:45.723 --> 02:43:49.026]  Kazmirchak, Northern Illinois University.
[02:43:49.546 --> 02:43:52.970]  He's a left-wing student with social justice concerns.
[02:43:52.970 --> 02:43:55.393]  He doesn't like the way the criminal justice system goes.
[02:43:55.393 --> 02:43:57.976]  The other Chinese guy that ran around a few years ago shooting the 14 bear hunters.
[02:43:59.469 --> 02:44:02.090]  And then I would then include the Unabomber.
[02:44:02.090 --> 02:44:06.130]  This is not quite as recent, but the idea of ecological terrorism.
[02:44:06.130 --> 02:44:15.532]  If you're a polluter, if your carbon footprint is too big, maybe the new Unabomber or Earth First or somebody like this will come and visit you.
[02:44:15.532 --> 02:44:24.114]  Then we have the classic ones done by the British against Russia to signal the coming of the new policy, which is Litvinenko.
[02:44:24.754 --> 02:44:28.775]  A Russian from the KGB with nuclear terrorism.
[02:44:28.775 --> 02:44:34.697]  Don't think about the relations, just think about the sort of pictorial memes of the myth.
[02:44:34.697 --> 02:44:35.917]  Litvinenko is one.
[02:44:35.917 --> 02:44:36.917]  Politkovskaya.
[02:44:36.917 --> 02:44:41.518]  Now, she's a Russian journalist who's assassinated and immediately blamed Putin.
[02:44:41.518 --> 02:44:45.219]  All indications are that this comes from the Berezovsky stable.
[02:44:45.219 --> 02:44:50.180]  Boris Berezovsky, Russian oligarch, now working for British intelligence.
[02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:51.521]  Let's see what else we can pick up.
[02:44:51.521 --> 02:44:52.441]  Ilyas Akhmedov.
[02:44:53.098 --> 02:44:56.899]  This is, of course, the Chechen ambassador here.
[02:44:56.899 --> 02:45:01.300]  He's the ambassador of the main Chechen terrorist organization.
[02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:05.261]  The one with Basayev and Moskvadov, run by the CIA.
[02:45:05.261 --> 02:45:10.423]  Which, I would say, they're the people who blew up those buildings in Moscow in 1999.
[02:45:10.423 --> 02:45:16.445]  They're the ones who did the theater, the school in Beslan, and also the hospital in southern Russia in 1995.
[02:45:17.765 --> 02:45:22.811]  The Chechens have now claimed probably 1,000 to 1,500 dead.
[02:45:22.811 --> 02:45:33.263]  So the Russians, if you add up their, you know, the Butcher's Bill, the Russians have suffered from international terrorism at least as much as the U.S.
[02:45:33.263 --> 02:45:34.043]  in 9-11.
[02:45:34.043 --> 02:45:35.785]  But let's look at Akhmadov, right?
[02:45:35.785 --> 02:45:36.446]  He's here.
[02:45:37.427 --> 02:45:41.248]  Because Big New Brzezinski lobbied to get him asylum.
[02:45:41.248 --> 02:45:43.129]  He's not being paid with your money.
[02:45:43.129 --> 02:45:46.890]  State Department stipend under the Reagan-Facel program.
[02:45:46.890 --> 02:45:50.771]  He's living in a nice house here in Woodley Park by the zoo.
[02:45:50.771 --> 02:45:53.732]  He has an office at the National Endowment for Democracy.
[02:45:53.732 --> 02:45:59.153]  He gets a secretary, a travel budget, a public relations budget, all courtesy of the U.S.
[02:45:59.153 --> 02:45:59.593]  taxpayer.
[02:45:59.593 --> 02:46:02.354]  Now, the Russians have repeatedly said, this is a terrorist.
[02:46:03.214 --> 02:46:04.275]  You've got to extradite him.
[02:46:04.275 --> 02:46:05.375]  We want to put him on trial.
[02:46:05.375 --> 02:46:05.655]  The U.S.
[02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:06.516]  says no.
[02:46:06.516 --> 02:46:08.056]  He's a democratic force.
[02:46:08.056 --> 02:46:10.998]  As long as he's anti-Putin, it means that he's democratic.
[02:46:10.998 --> 02:46:20.022]  When you had that Beslan school in September of 2004, the Russian press was full of, this attack was planned in London and Washington.
[02:46:20.022 --> 02:46:22.143]  I believe it's actually quite correct.
[02:46:22.703 --> 02:46:26.165]  So, if you add up these faces, right?
[02:46:26.165 --> 02:46:33.869]  Cho, Kazimierczak, Litvinenko in particular, the Unabomber, and then somebody like Ilyas Akhmedov.
[02:46:33.869 --> 02:46:43.095]  I think that's a composite of memes from which you can see the probably various kinds of false flag terrorism that are now likely to be unleashed.
[02:46:43.095 --> 02:46:43.395]  And again,
[02:46:44.596 --> 02:46:46.539]  It's not just Chechens, right?
[02:46:46.539 --> 02:46:47.961]  It could be the FARC.
[02:46:47.961 --> 02:46:52.227]  We saw this tremendous media circus around this woman, Betancourt.
[02:46:52.227 --> 02:46:53.028]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:46:54.246 --> 02:46:56.566]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[02:46:56.566 --> 02:47:02.787]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[02:47:02.787 --> 02:47:05.728]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[02:47:05.728 --> 02:47:15.110]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean, and sparkling, then you need SoliSmile All Natural Tooth Powder, the first tooth powder of its kind.
[02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:23.451]  SoliSmile contains 84 mineral-rich Himalayan sea salt, baking soda, and xylitol, a sugar substitute with long-lasting dental benefits.
[02:47:23.931 --> 02:47:29.915]  Soleil Smile comes in five flavors, made from grade A essential oils, so I know it'll please even your kids.
[02:47:29.915 --> 02:47:33.758]  You'll also appreciate the convenient 2 ounce airline safe size.

[02:47:54.211 --> 02:47:56.334]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[02:47:56.334 --> 02:47:58.776]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:47:58.776 --> 02:48:01.379]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:48:01.379 --> 02:48:02.620]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:48:02.620 --> 02:48:04.282]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:48:04.282 --> 02:48:07.205]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:48:07.205 --> 02:48:10.829]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:48:19.198 --> 02:48:20.462]  We're at our own door!
[02:48:20.462 --> 02:48:25.315]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:29.141]  I'm sad, John.
[02:48:29.141 --> 02:48:33.222]  How dare you?
[02:48:33.222 --> 02:48:36.803]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:48:36.803 --> 02:48:39.544]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:48:39.544 --> 02:48:45.025]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[02:48:45.025 --> 02:48:46.026]  Truth Rising.
[02:48:46.026 --> 02:48:48.867]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:48:48.867 --> 02:48:51.107]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:48:51.107 --> 02:48:53.588]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:48:54.168 --> 02:48:57.530]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[02:48:57.530 --> 02:49:01.253]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[02:49:01.253 --> 02:49:05.335]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[02:49:05.335 --> 02:49:10.038]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[02:49:10.038 --> 02:49:12.840]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.983]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[02:49:18.463 --> 02:49:25.109]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.

[02:49:31.155 --> 02:49:34.117]  Simply spray it on, let it dry, and you're protected.

[02:49:42.884 --> 02:49:44.084]  That's SprayYourPlate.com.
[02:49:44.084 --> 02:49:45.264]  Don't give your money to the state.
[02:49:45.264 --> 02:49:45.864]  Spray your plate!
[02:50:05.951 --> 02:50:09.012]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[02:50:09.012 --> 02:50:13.173]  We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[02:50:13.173 --> 02:50:16.074]  I'm eastbound, just one more bandit run.
[02:50:16.074 --> 02:50:20.756]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[02:50:35.254 --> 02:50:36.955]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:50:36.955 --> 02:50:38.355]  to 3 p.m.
[02:50:38.355 --> 02:50:41.036]  Central Standard Time.
[02:50:41.036 --> 02:50:42.416]  And then we are back.
[02:50:42.416 --> 02:50:46.037]  Right here on the network.
[02:50:46.037 --> 02:50:49.578]  9 to 1 on the Genesis feeds.
[02:50:49.578 --> 02:50:51.539]  24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:51.539 --> 02:50:54.860]  We do the 4-hour show, then for 20 hours it re-airs back-to-back.
[02:50:54.860 --> 02:51:00.382]  So you missed Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and his analysis of what happened in Russia, very similar to TARP police.
[02:51:00.382 --> 02:51:04.623]  That'll be re-airing when this show ends in about 1 hour and 4 minutes from now.
[02:51:05.885 --> 02:51:07.106]  We're going to take your calls.
[02:51:07.106 --> 02:51:10.328]  Wide open phones in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:51:10.328 --> 02:51:15.993]  Any subject you want to discuss, Webster has agreed to ride shotgun with us.
[02:51:15.993 --> 02:51:20.256]  We always enjoy having him on with us.
[02:51:20.256 --> 02:51:20.816]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:51:20.816 --> 02:51:24.539]  Interesting story I'll cover later in the next hour.
[02:51:24.539 --> 02:51:27.101]  Beijing Olympics 2009 Opening Ceremony.
[02:51:27.101 --> 02:51:29.423]  Giant firework footprints.
[02:51:29.423 --> 02:51:29.763]  Faked!
[02:51:30.825 --> 02:51:37.050]  Yeah, that's the kind of stuff China and Russia and every government... All governments are evil and wicked and corrupt.
[02:51:37.050 --> 02:51:38.871]  But who is the dominant global force?
[02:51:38.871 --> 02:51:42.394]  Well, that is, as Tarpley calls it, the Anglo-American Empire.
[02:51:42.394 --> 02:51:42.874]  Doesn't matter.
[02:51:42.874 --> 02:51:43.615]  They're all corrupt.
[02:51:43.615 --> 02:51:44.315]  They're all bad.
[02:51:44.315 --> 02:51:48.958]  We're just cold-bloodedly analyzing how they're fighting with each other and what they're doing.
[02:51:48.958 --> 02:51:52.201]  Remember, the state is the enemy of the people, bottom line, throughout history.
[02:51:53.058 --> 02:52:02.407]  Uh, the problem is there's always other states trying to come in and take over your state, so it's a very, uh, very serious equilibrium that has to be held with the size of the state.
[02:52:02.407 --> 02:52:05.810]  Uh, but again, we'll continue with Tarpley here in just a moment.
[02:52:05.810 --> 02:52:08.232]  Don't forget, I am a documentary filmmaker.
[02:52:08.232 --> 02:52:09.714]  I have made 19 films.
[02:52:09.714 --> 02:52:13.237]  The latest is Truth Rising.
[02:52:13.237 --> 02:52:18.141]  And it's got Zbigniew Brzezinski being confronted in it by the young Luke Radowski and him saying, sit down and shut up!
[02:52:19.366 --> 02:52:25.409]  And it's got everybody else from Geraldo Rivera to Barack Obama to Hillary Clinton to John McCain being confronted.
[02:52:25.409 --> 02:52:29.672]  And then it's got Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, the good guys in it.
[02:52:29.672 --> 02:52:31.613]  It's got Democracy Now!'
[02:52:31.573 --> 02:52:35.375]  's Amy Goodman talking about bombs in the building.
[02:52:35.375 --> 02:52:39.917]  It's got George Carlin, right before he died, talking about an inside job on 9-11.
[02:52:39.917 --> 02:52:43.559]  It's got the police trying to plant bombs on 9-11 activists.
[02:52:43.559 --> 02:52:45.900]  I mean, I really can't describe how powerful.
[02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:48.822]  This is probably the best view of any film I've made, the most entertaining.
[02:52:49.617 --> 02:52:57.149]  I mean, you talk about short attention span theater, it just moves from issue to issue, really grabbing people in a way, in a different way than other films.
[02:52:57.149 --> 02:53:02.158]  Truth Rising, available at InfoWars.com on DVD, or watch it right now on super high quality.
[02:53:03.072 --> 02:53:06.573]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, all 19 of my films.

[02:56:16.663 --> 02:56:21.689]  Going back to Webster Tarpley, when we come back in the next segment, we will take your calls for the balance of the hour.
[02:56:24.673 --> 02:56:27.315]  Finishing up with what you expect to see in this election.
[02:56:27.315 --> 02:56:30.297]  I know you think that the greater of two evils is Barack Obama.
[02:56:30.297 --> 02:56:31.918]  I myself see it as a huge distraction.
[02:56:31.918 --> 02:56:42.324]  But I understand you're saying his star appeal, and I agree, will bring people into the fold to support the corporate fascism and give them the grassroots cover they need.
[02:56:42.324 --> 02:56:44.846]  So I agree with you he's the most dangerous candidate.
[02:56:45.746 --> 02:56:56.093]  I just psychologically have divorced myself so much from the two parties, and fully understand they're puppets that I can't even really see Obama, I guess as many other people see him.
[02:56:56.093 --> 02:57:01.977]  But in closing, in the three and a half minutes we have left in this opening segment, other key points you'd like to make?
[02:57:01.977 --> 02:57:13.204]  Well, I would say first of all, if you get Obama with the Democratic Congress, you will have the full fury of the fascist corporate state, in terms of that economic austerity,
[02:57:13.757 --> 02:57:32.647]  Killer austerity, genocidal austerity that I talked about, under green, polar bear, snail daughter auspices, third world solidarity, and possibly even this other question of reparations to that ethnic group, which would also be a very explosive recipe.
[02:57:32.647 --> 02:57:40.771]  If you get McCain, I would say you get a tired, old, lame duck, who is going to be a lame duck from the first moment he gets there.
[02:57:40.771 --> 02:57:41.832]  He'll be quacking in his
[02:57:42.668 --> 02:57:44.709]  In his inaugural address.
[02:57:44.709 --> 02:57:48.492]  And he will be faced by a very hostile Democratic Congress, giving us gridlock.
[02:57:48.492 --> 02:57:53.314]  This is the best outcome we could get under that scenario, would be the gridlock.
[02:57:53.314 --> 02:57:57.757]  So, in this sense, McCain is actually a lesser evil than Obama.
[02:57:57.757 --> 02:57:59.998]  The Democrats try to scare you with McCain.
[02:57:59.998 --> 02:58:02.440]  They tell you that he's going to put in these fascist judges.
[02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:06.062]  Well, the Democrats can filibuster those judges if they want to.
[02:58:06.062 --> 02:58:07.803]  So don't try to scare us with that.
[02:58:07.803 --> 02:58:11.105]  With Mrs. Clinton, I think you get a much more open-ended
[02:58:12.248 --> 02:58:34.744]  This is somebody who responds to public opinion through triangulation, but she does respond, and her history during the primaries has been to move more and more towards New Deal positions, at least verbally, and that's what we've got to work with at this point, and this would also allow a solution that would not be McCain and not be Obama.
[02:58:34.744 --> 02:58:37.906]  That's the demerit of Mrs. Clinton, is that she's not McCain and she's not
[02:58:38.425 --> 02:58:38.925]  Obama.
[02:58:38.925 --> 02:58:46.688]  And I think there is going to be a movement to try to get her nominated and perhaps even to change the outcome of the convention.
[02:58:46.688 --> 02:58:51.510]  But I think that the principle idea is you've got to build a movement.
[02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:58.413]  The way you build a movement is figure out what the financiers want most and oppose them.
[02:58:58.413 --> 02:59:00.574]  I would not say that the state is always the enemy.
[02:59:00.574 --> 02:59:02.435]  My analysis of history is different.
[02:59:02.435 --> 02:59:08.097]  I would say financier oligarchs, feudal aristocrats in the more distant past,
[02:59:08.817 --> 02:59:13.561]  Financiers, finance oligarchs, bankers are the enemy.
[02:59:13.561 --> 02:59:36.240]  And if you look at the origin of the modern state under somebody like John Gagliazzo Visconti in Milan in the early about 1400, if you looked then at Louis XI of France in the 1470s, 1480s, and Henry VII of England, the Earl of Richmond, the guy who got rid of Richard III, what you see there is an alliance of the king, that is the state,
[02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:40.857]  With the bourgeoisie, the cities, and the peasantry against what?
[02:59:40.857 --> 02:59:42.460]  Against feudal oligarchs.
[02:59:42.924 --> 02:59:47.827]  Who are already transforming themselves into banking oligarchs and seers.
[02:59:47.827 --> 02:59:52.811]  Well, Webster, my point is that big states are the most abusive throughout history.
[02:59:52.811 --> 02:59:53.912]  It breeds corruption.
[02:59:53.912 --> 02:59:56.273]  The corrupt come in to suck out of it.
[02:59:56.273 --> 02:59:59.475]  And so, look at what the oligarchs always want.
[02:59:59.475 --> 03:00:08.281]  They always want a big state as their tool to control populations, destroy middle classes, wage war on the bourgeoisie using the commie terms.
[03:00:08.281 --> 03:00:09.943]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley.
[03:00:10.663 --> 03:00:16.091]  Your phone calls, right here on the one and only Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:00:16.091 --> 03:00:16.912]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.751 --> 03:00:28.292]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:00:28.292 --> 03:00:29.532]  And we knew what to do.
[03:00:29.532 --> 03:00:31.773]  And then look at what the oligarchs always want.
[03:00:31.773 --> 03:00:40.557]  They always want a big state as their tool to control populations, destroy middle classes, wage war on the bourgeoisie using the commie terms.
[03:00:40.557 --> 03:00:48.400]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley and your phone calls right here on the one, the only Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:49.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:54.762 --> 03:01:00.488]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:01:00.488 --> 03:01:01.810]  And we knew what to do.
[03:01:01.810 --> 03:01:03.832]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:01:03.832 --> 03:01:10.859]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:01:10.859 --> 03:01:16.025]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[03:01:16.997 --> 03:01:19.738]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[03:01:19.738 --> 03:01:26.842]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:01:26.842 --> 03:01:30.003]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:01:30.003 --> 03:01:35.126]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:01:35.786 --> 03:01:38.869]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:01:47.837 --> 03:01:52.741]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:01:54.366 --> 03:01:58.869]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:01:58.869 --> 03:02:03.973]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:02:03.973 --> 03:02:05.494]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:02:05.494 --> 03:02:09.096]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[03:02:54.309 --> 03:02:57.832]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:02:57.832 --> 03:03:03.237]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:03:03.237 --> 03:03:08.402]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:03:08.402 --> 03:03:12.366]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water.
[03:03:12.366 --> 03:03:16.510]  And it's de- That's 1-877-886-3653.

[03:03:23.391 --> 03:03:30.013]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:03:30.013 --> 03:03:41.877]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:03:41.877 --> 03:03:44.558]  Okay, we've got Webster Tarpley with us for the rest of the hour.
[03:03:44.558 --> 03:03:49.400]  An in-depth interview today with him on the economy, the election,
[03:03:50.785 --> 03:03:57.430]  Almost happened in Russia, in future actions.
[03:03:57.430 --> 03:04:07.157]  Before we go any further, Webster, is there anything else you want to add concerning the geopolitical climate we're in right now before we go to calls?
[03:04:07.157 --> 03:04:08.397]  Certainly.
[03:04:08.397 --> 03:04:16.103]  I think right now you've got to also look at the situation in Europe, because one of Brzezinski's main goals, of course, is to play Europe against Russia, too.
[03:04:16.781 --> 03:04:29.933]  Normally, Europe would gravitate towards Russia right now because of the oil, the natural gas, the epicenter of the current world economic breakdown crisis, the Bush economic depression, is of course London and New York.
[03:04:29.933 --> 03:04:36.139]  They've been hit hardest, and other people have been hit hard because they've gotten into bed with London and New York.
[03:04:36.139 --> 03:04:42.545]  There's a whole school of opinion in France, Germany, Italy, on the continent that it's time now to orient towards the Russians
[03:04:43.047 --> 03:04:48.611]  East-West trade, oil for technology, mutually beneficial economic development.
[03:04:48.611 --> 03:04:50.773]  So Brzezinski's got to destroy that.
[03:04:50.773 --> 03:05:02.961]  And what he wants to use is that cordon sanitaire, or that, you know, that unsanitary cordon of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Ukraine to begin cutting off the natural gas.
[03:05:02.961 --> 03:05:11.948]  The Russians, of course, are going around that by building a pipeline down the middle of the Baltic so that they can deliver guaranteed energy without the Ukrainians and the Poles
[03:05:12.566 --> 03:05:16.929]  Skimming, or cutting it off, or provoking, or the rest of this stuff.
[03:05:16.929 --> 03:05:33.381]  Remember, we have to thank, ironically enough, in this terrible situation, we have to thank Sarkozy, of all people, and Merkel, for blocking the attempt by Brzezinski to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO as members, or at least get that going.
[03:05:34.039 --> 03:05:36.560]  At the last NATO meeting back in April.
[03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:39.682]  Remember, Obama wants Georgia in NATO.
[03:05:39.682 --> 03:05:41.603]  The Washington Post want them in there.
[03:05:41.603 --> 03:05:43.084]  We've got to say no.
[03:05:43.084 --> 03:05:48.567]  No NATO membership for this bandit, thug, kleptocrat regime.
[03:05:48.567 --> 03:05:54.770]  The other thing is, the Italian position right now, the Italian government is Berlusconi.
[03:05:54.770 --> 03:05:58.052]  This just shows you what kind of a situation we're in.
[03:05:58.052 --> 03:06:02.835]  Berlusconi, of course, is this dirty character that everybody knows.
[03:06:03.359 --> 03:06:21.442]  But he's also a friend of the Russians, and the Italians have gone very, very far in this East-West trade, oil-for-technology kind of stuff, and they've got a history of building, you know, huge automobile plants, like the Togliatti Fiat plant that built all those Ladas that are still running.
[03:06:21.442 --> 03:06:32.704]  The Italians are saying, the Foreign Minister Frattini is saying, we cannot transform the European Union into an anti-Russian bloc, so Georgia, get lost, stay out there.
[03:06:33.211 --> 03:06:38.776]  I've also been in touch with my friend Giulietto Chiesa, a member of the European Parliament in Brussels.
[03:06:38.776 --> 03:06:44.261]  You remember, he's the one who did the Zero documentary.
[03:06:44.261 --> 03:06:46.863]  I was in Milan last November.
[03:06:46.863 --> 03:06:55.731]  We had, oh, 500 people in an auditorium with Dario Fall, Nobel Prize for Literature and probably the most read playwright in the world today.
[03:06:56.550 --> 03:07:03.373]  There's an anthology also called Zero, with essays by all sorts of people, among them yours truly.
[03:07:03.373 --> 03:07:14.517]  So Giulietto Chiesa is leading a publicity effort in Europe to try to show people that Georgia is this bunch of pawns of Brzezinski.
[03:07:14.517 --> 03:07:21.419]  So there's also a lot of work to be done vis-à-vis the Europeans, trying to get them to break away.
[03:07:21.419 --> 03:07:25.241]  In other words, don't become a lemming for Obama, like those poor Germans.
[03:07:25.874 --> 03:07:31.478]  Uh, in the, uh, at the, uh, Victory Column there, the Siegesäule, in, in the, uh, in the middle of Berlin.
[03:07:31.478 --> 03:07:34.900]  Don't go with that, but rather dump Obama.
[03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:52.070]  I'm very glad to say my book, uh, Obama, the Postmodern Coup, is coming out in a German edition in the KOPP, that is K-O-P-P, which, uh, will be, will be hitting the, the newsstands, um, fairly soon, in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair, among other things.
[03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:54.812]  Um, I'm also coming out in Japan, because there's another place.
[03:07:55.359 --> 03:08:02.884]  The Japanese have said very clearly, it was a successful summit of Prime Minister Fukuda with President Hu of China.
[03:08:02.884 --> 03:08:07.626]  The Japanese Defense Minister said, the biggest threat to us is chaos in China.
[03:08:07.626 --> 03:08:13.050]  This is a way of saying, dear Big New, we will not be a staging area for your attacks on China.
[03:08:13.050 --> 03:08:23.236]  In Taiwan, the KMT, the Kuomintang Party, has made a comeback, kicking out the US puppets, the DPP, Green Party, or Democratic Progressive Party.
[03:08:23.655 --> 03:08:32.097]  Get rid of them, put in people who are reasonable, who realize that their future is a rapprochement with China and mutually beneficial trade.
[03:08:32.097 --> 03:08:36.058]  Okay, I'm sorry I've got to stop you there because I want to give some time to callers.
[03:08:36.058 --> 03:08:39.759]  I have to say, everything you're saying is accurate about what's happening in the world.
[03:08:39.759 --> 03:08:42.839]  I don't disagree with about 95% of what you're saying.
[03:08:42.839 --> 03:08:47.120]  The problem is, there's more to all of this.
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:48.881]  It is a fact that the CIA
[03:08:51.451 --> 03:08:54.653]  Back the Communists against the Japanese in China.
[03:08:54.653 --> 03:09:07.961]  It is a fact now declassified that the CIA, and David Rockefeller's written editorials in the New York Times saying this, wanted the Communist Chinese to come to power so that they could use them in China.
[03:09:07.961 --> 03:09:16.906]  It is a fact that Armand Hammer and the Rockefellers and the big foundation monies pumped billions into Russia from its founding, overthrowing the czars.
[03:09:18.035 --> 03:09:18.195]  We're
[03:09:36.189 --> 03:09:43.293]  Which leaves all nation states weak and vulnerable and basically starving and infighting with regional and religious conflicts.
[03:09:43.293 --> 03:09:49.136]  I just want to point out that we're not saying China's good or Russia's good or anybody's good here.
[03:09:49.136 --> 03:09:50.457]  You can disagree if you want.
[03:09:50.457 --> 03:09:59.862]  It's that you have this evil global corporate management system that was developed out of London, the city of London, and
[03:10:01.434 --> 03:10:08.621]  I just don't want to oversimplify this where America and England and Israel are the bad guys and everybody else are the good guys.
[03:10:08.621 --> 03:10:12.165]  All these countries are engaging in oppression and corruption.
[03:10:12.165 --> 03:10:21.154]  That's the nature of society and I'm just trying to get people to see the bigger picture of how these big tectonic forces are colliding into each other.
[03:10:21.653 --> 03:10:29.299]  Well, let's look at the heart of the world problem right now is this mass of derivatives, this cancerous mass of kited derivatives.
[03:10:29.299 --> 03:10:34.783]  And that was a financial weapons system by the central banks while the dollar was still the world reserve currency.
[03:10:34.783 --> 03:10:44.251]  They made a mad dash to buy up all the real infrastructure of the world, buy up the defense contractors, media of the world, to set up their global corporate empire off of the yoke
[03:10:44.691 --> 03:10:49.613]  You know, like an egg off of the sustenance that was the United States.
[03:10:49.613 --> 03:11:11.200]  Now they want to leave us holding the financial bag for that collapse while they've moved into safe havens, then bring in a third world police state here and use the United States as a military enclave to produce modern Hessian soldiers for the new global corporate state that has shucked any connection to any original nation state.
[03:11:11.920 --> 03:11:19.825]  But remember now, if we use my estimate of 1 quadrillion, it's probably 1.5 quadrillion or maybe a lot more.
[03:11:19.825 --> 03:11:22.567]  Well, it's 6,000 trillion that we know of.
[03:11:22.567 --> 03:11:27.611]  Well, yes, but I'm saying 1, well, you want to say 2 quadrillion.
[03:11:27.611 --> 03:11:30.913]  Fine, 2 quadrillion is ballpark, perfectly good.
[03:11:30.913 --> 03:11:31.894]  Where is that centered?
[03:11:31.894 --> 03:11:35.196]  Well, about a quarter of that is just JPMorgan Chase.
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:40.342]  And when you add up the rest of the U.S., you'll get up to well over half.
[03:11:40.342 --> 03:11:45.003]  You'll get up to probably two-thirds of the derivatives, and the rest are in London.
[03:11:45.003 --> 03:11:48.804]  So there you see where the center of this cancer is.
[03:11:48.804 --> 03:11:52.706]  To say that Russia is the same as this... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:11:52.706 --> 03:11:55.007]  I'm saying they're just not as powerful.
[03:11:55.007 --> 03:11:55.507]  Absolutely.
[03:11:55.507 --> 03:12:00.388]  The Anglo-American establishment flooded the world with this liquidity to get everybody in debt and get real assets.
[03:12:00.388 --> 03:12:01.869]  Now they're going to leave us holding the bag.
[03:12:02.409 --> 03:12:03.930]  So I don't, quote, see the U.S.
[03:12:03.930 --> 03:12:06.071]  now becoming a sub-player in all this.
[03:12:06.071 --> 03:12:08.013]  That was a foregone conclusion.
[03:12:08.013 --> 03:12:24.484]  I'm saying now the New World Order, the Anglo-American Empire as you call it, is moving to that transcendent point where they sit above all the nation-states with their private intelligence networks in Russia, in China, in Israel, in the U.S., just playing us all off against each other.
[03:12:25.507 --> 03:12:27.589]  I don't believe that they have total world control.
[03:12:27.589 --> 03:12:28.149]  No, I don't.
[03:12:28.149 --> 03:12:29.931]  I think that there are real conflicts in the world.
[03:12:29.931 --> 03:12:31.432]  I don't think they have total world control.
[03:12:31.432 --> 03:12:34.775]  I'm saying they are dominant.
[03:12:34.775 --> 03:12:37.397]  Dominant up to a point, but fading fast.
[03:12:37.397 --> 03:12:43.522]  And Obama is really a flight forward, a desperate bid to give this a facelift, to give it a new lease on life.
[03:12:43.522 --> 03:12:47.465]  And if you block Obama, you're going to be dealing with a severely weakened imperialism.
[03:12:48.364 --> 03:13:03.416]  I'm going to skip this break for people behind the scenes watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and listening on the exclusive InfoWars.com streams, and then at 24 after, I promise, no more pontificating by myself or Webster.
[03:13:03.416 --> 03:13:04.297]  It's all great info.
[03:13:04.297 --> 03:13:07.260]  Steve, Rico, Elliot, Cliff, Jeff, and many others.
[03:13:07.260 --> 03:13:09.341]  We're going to go right to you in about five minutes.
[03:13:10.442 --> 03:13:12.323]  Okay, how does it affect the American people?
[03:13:12.323 --> 03:13:18.527]  Let's be centered on ourselves for a minute, and take the local, regional view for North America.
[03:13:18.527 --> 03:13:20.148]  What is better for the American people?
[03:13:20.148 --> 03:13:24.010]  For the empire to crumble and fall apart, or for us to mindlessly support it?
[03:13:24.010 --> 03:13:33.576]  Obviously, I believe mindlessly supporting it, they will only rape us that much more financially and physically, and so it is good to let this fall apart.
[03:13:33.576 --> 03:13:39.180]  I would go with the populists, those prairie farmers back in 1890 meeting in Omaha,
[03:13:39.853 --> 03:13:49.301]  And they formulated the Populist Party program, which basically said, a mass movement needs to take over the government and turn it against Rockefeller, Morgan, and the Wall Street group.
[03:13:49.301 --> 03:13:51.743]  And I don't think that has changed.
[03:13:51.743 --> 03:13:52.824]  That's what we should be doing.
[03:13:52.824 --> 03:13:57.007]  So he's a Golden Cross speech?
[03:13:57.007 --> 03:13:59.569]  Yes, although that's William Jennings Bryan.
[03:13:59.569 --> 03:14:02.732]  He's not really an organic representative of this.
[03:14:02.732 --> 03:14:06.455]  He is at least a politician who grew up in that milieu.
[03:14:07.196 --> 03:14:09.359]  And he's trying to fight Wall Street.
[03:14:09.359 --> 03:14:21.835]  Again, maybe he's not a good example, but if you want to think who's like us, who's isolated like we are, or relatively, with not that much money, take those populists of 1890, and I think their strategy is valid.
[03:14:21.835 --> 03:14:24.519]  Now, you want to oppose the empire, you also want to construct
[03:14:25.063 --> 03:14:26.064]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:14:48.875 --> 03:14:53.797]  Look, I tell you, the populists in Omaha said, the government is going to belong to us.
[03:14:53.797 --> 03:14:55.918]  The goal is not get government out of your life.
[03:14:55.918 --> 03:14:57.678]  The goal is you take over the government.
[03:14:57.678 --> 03:15:03.941]  Now Milton Friedman, of course, from the Rockefeller Chicago School, says, government is always the problem.
[03:15:03.941 --> 03:15:05.041]  I don't buy that.
[03:15:05.041 --> 03:15:08.602]  Wall Street, finance oligarchs... See, that's only one hand of the elite.
[03:15:08.602 --> 03:15:09.763]  That's only one hand.
[03:15:09.763 --> 03:15:15.525]  They claim they don't want government, but in truth they do want big government to suck off us with corporate welfare.
[03:15:16.795 --> 03:15:20.557]  Again, I don't... Hold on Webster, we're going to behind the scenes.
[03:15:20.557 --> 03:15:21.337]  I want to abbreviate this.
[03:15:21.337 --> 03:15:22.717]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:22.717 --> 03:15:25.339]  Go ahead now, we've got four minutes.
[03:15:25.339 --> 03:15:28.180]  I don't see that as the meaningful distinction.
[03:15:28.180 --> 03:15:33.422]  In other words, right now, you've got the question of foreclosures.
[03:15:33.422 --> 03:15:43.026]  If you leave this to the market, or if you leave it to the stuff we've got in place right now, we're going to have millions and millions of people thrown out of their homes, and we're going to have
[03:15:43.484 --> 03:15:46.246]  Millions and millions of domestic refugees and homeless.
[03:15:46.246 --> 03:15:47.327]  How do you stop that?
[03:15:47.327 --> 03:15:49.169]  You do it with a uniform federal law.
[03:15:49.169 --> 03:15:50.430]  No foreclosures.
[03:15:50.430 --> 03:15:51.851]  Foreclosures are over.
[03:15:51.851 --> 03:15:53.813]  You foreclose, you go to Leavenworth.
[03:15:53.813 --> 03:15:57.877]  On a home, on a farm, on a business, a taxi company, a trucking company.
[03:15:57.877 --> 03:16:02.521]  Well then people just stop paying completely and then things really implode.
[03:16:02.521 --> 03:16:04.823]  And then we owe interest on all that debt to the bankers.
[03:16:05.103 --> 03:16:06.384]  But no, we're going to wipe them out.
[03:16:06.384 --> 03:16:10.907]  In other words, what do you do with the quadrillion or two quadrillion of derivatives, is you wipe them out.
[03:16:10.907 --> 03:16:12.188]  You could do it two ways.
[03:16:12.188 --> 03:16:22.274]  You could do it with a law that simply says derivatives are illegal, because they are, as they were up until the early 1990s, or my method, tax them out of existence.
[03:16:22.274 --> 03:16:33.581]  Put a 1% Tobin tax or... And because they're blind shorting, naked shorting, and there's no real money behind it, they won't even belly up for a 1%?
[03:16:35.253 --> 03:16:38.714]  Well, yeah, we're paying, you know, I don't know what the sales tax in Texas is.
[03:16:38.714 --> 03:16:40.875]  It's 5% in Maryland.
[03:16:40.875 --> 03:16:41.415]  7.
[03:16:41.415 --> 03:16:42.956]  And you don't pay it on groceries.
[03:16:42.956 --> 03:16:47.198]  In Virginia, it's 5 to 7 and you pay it on groceries.
[03:16:47.198 --> 03:16:48.778]  The groceries is a big part of it.
[03:16:48.778 --> 03:16:52.380]  How come the Wall Street finance oligarchs can't pay their fair share?
[03:16:52.380 --> 03:16:56.341]  How about that Tobin tax, that securities transfer tax?
[03:16:56.341 --> 03:16:58.182]  If it's 2 quadrillion of derivatives,
[03:16:58.875 --> 03:17:09.600]  A 1% tax, and suppose two-thirds of that is in the U.S., you're up to about 1.2... Well, derivatives are predominantly global, and so the global government will have to implement that.
[03:17:09.600 --> 03:17:10.320]  But no, wait!
[03:17:10.320 --> 03:17:12.501]  There's no global government.
[03:17:12.501 --> 03:17:24.126]  The United States government, using sovereign economic powers, can tax JPMorgan Chase and say, well, you have 500 million... Well, you said the Tobin tax, and that was introduced as a world tax.
[03:17:24.126 --> 03:17:28.048]  I have a better way to do it, which is to not just to tax foreign exchange transactions,
[03:17:28.496 --> 03:17:33.557]  But to tax all financial turnover, it would be a speculation tax.
[03:17:33.557 --> 03:17:39.338]  Right now, 40% of the price of oil, or 50%, is pure speculation.
[03:17:39.338 --> 03:17:40.538]  What are you going to do about that?
[03:17:40.538 --> 03:17:48.480]  If you want the market, that speculation will get even worse, because even the regulatory regime we have, which is a joke, will be gone.
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:51.720]  They'll be gouging you without surcease.
[03:17:51.720 --> 03:17:55.141]  What you've got to do is to say, alright, you want to speculate, you're going to pay a 1%
[03:17:56.321 --> 03:18:03.205]  Well, you could also make it illegal to engage in all this leveraging where they don't even put money in.
[03:18:03.205 --> 03:18:04.566]  Well, here's an example, Webster.
[03:18:04.566 --> 03:18:06.747]  Look at government education and what it's done.
[03:18:16.789 --> 03:18:18.290]  Before, we didn't have government education.
[03:18:18.290 --> 03:18:20.271]  We had the smartest, most educated people in the world.
[03:18:20.271 --> 03:18:23.713]  Now, I hear people in stores talking about Russians attacking Georgia in the U.S.
[03:18:23.713 --> 03:18:26.695]  There's a chemical watershed that you've got to be aware of.
[03:18:26.695 --> 03:18:30.437]  In 1968, the New Deal came to an end.
[03:18:30.437 --> 03:18:35.140]  And this was by the folly of Johnson, by the Vietnam War, and all the rest.
[03:18:35.140 --> 03:18:39.523]  What we've had for 40 years after that is the rule of the reactionary Republicans.
[03:18:39.523 --> 03:18:41.304]  It's the social engineering is what we've had.
[03:18:41.304 --> 03:18:41.965]  We've had the eugenicist
[03:18:44.468 --> 03:18:47.792]  Carrying this out while the bleeding-heart liberals run around saying, help the poor people.
[03:18:47.792 --> 03:18:51.196]  This is all relevant, but the thing you gotta focus on is production.
[03:18:52.821 --> 03:18:58.965]  I'm telling you this, any government system you come up with, no matter how well-meaning, will be hijacked by the oligarchs, and it always is.
[03:18:58.965 --> 03:19:01.767]  Well then, it sounds like we live in a hopelessly fallen world.
[03:19:01.767 --> 03:19:13.955]  No, if we remove a lot of the taxation mechanisms against us, I'm all for taxing them, but you notice we'll never get that, then... It has been done in the past, and the New Deal was essentially that, and it can be done again.
[03:19:13.955 --> 03:19:16.097]  Okay, we're coming back to the main transmission right now.
[03:19:16.097 --> 03:19:18.398]  I want to come in with intro music, folks.
[03:19:18.398 --> 03:19:19.379]  I want to take phone calls.
[03:19:19.379 --> 03:19:20.680]  We're talking to Webster Tarpley.
[03:19:20.680 --> 03:19:20.940]  Here we go.
[03:19:28.959 --> 03:19:34.543]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[03:19:34.543 --> 03:19:40.046]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[03:19:40.046 --> 03:19:45.450]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[03:19:45.450 --> 03:19:49.033]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[03:19:50.975 --> 03:19:54.476]  It's a death-defying life I lead.
[03:19:54.476 --> 03:19:56.517]  I take my chances.
[03:19:56.517 --> 03:20:01.879]  I'd die for a living in the movies and TV.
[03:20:01.879 --> 03:20:12.723]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[03:20:12.723 --> 03:20:13.623]  I might fall from
[03:20:14.966 --> 03:20:20.699]  He is the author of Obama, the Postmodernist Coup, available at InfoWars.com.
[03:20:20.699 --> 03:20:21.922]  Your phone calls right now.
[03:20:23.484 --> 03:20:38.431]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide as we blast out on AM and FM dial across the country, global shortwave at WWCR, the internet at infowars.com, and of course with now more than 60,000 people a day pulling our free podcast.
[03:20:38.431 --> 03:20:47.295]  If you haven't done it, check it out, listen how you want, when you want, where you want, and of course number one on Shoutcast, number one on the internet for radio listeners.
[03:20:47.295 --> 03:20:49.216]  Webster Tarpley continuing
[03:20:50.216 --> 03:20:54.037]  With your analysis, let's get the take of the callers.
[03:20:54.037 --> 03:20:57.338]  Steve, in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:20:57.338 --> 03:21:01.899]  Well, first of all, I want to say I'm talking to two fine men.
[03:21:01.899 --> 03:21:07.840]  Secondly, I think that you guys have been turned around backwards on this situation with Russia.
[03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:16.982]  You didn't even report that last month, it was July 25th, that Putin had threatened the United States with stationing atomic bombers in Cuba.
[03:21:18.638 --> 03:21:21.340]  Look, Putin has been warning the U.S.
[03:21:21.340 --> 03:21:28.468]  loyally all through 2007 at that Munich Verkunde meeting in the springtime.
[03:21:28.468 --> 03:21:31.712]  He talked about this neocon striving for the U.S.
[03:21:31.712 --> 03:21:32.212]  Stop, stop, Tarbly.
[03:21:32.212 --> 03:21:33.353]  I'm going to let you get to it in a minute.
[03:21:33.353 --> 03:21:36.357]  Because this is, Steve, you can't listen to four hours every day.
[03:21:36.357 --> 03:21:37.538]  I don't believe it.
[03:21:37.538 --> 03:21:38.899]  I have been saying for the last
[03:21:39.895 --> 03:21:43.096]  However many months since this was said, I talk about that every week.
[03:21:43.096 --> 03:22:02.543]  I talk about their foreign minister saying, if you keep moving weapons systems and troops and training and destabilizing in Poland and in Czech Republic and in Georgia and in Ukraine and in all these areas and in the stands and moving your military in, we're going to start moving nukes near you.
[03:22:02.543 --> 03:22:05.064]  And I have said that on record.
[03:22:05.064 --> 03:22:06.184]  So go ahead.
[03:22:06.184 --> 03:22:08.785]  Okay, so you're reporting your point of view.
[03:22:09.181 --> 03:22:17.288]  You don't ever mention the people in Eastern and Central Europe talking about a domino theory where the situation is dialectic.
[03:22:17.288 --> 03:22:20.531]  In other words, Russia... Sir, Russia, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.
[03:22:20.531 --> 03:22:23.113]  Russia is shrinking, not getting bigger.
[03:22:23.113 --> 03:22:26.276]  It wasn't Russia that snuck attack a U.S.
[03:22:26.276 --> 03:22:27.858]  military base last Thursday night.
[03:22:27.858 --> 03:22:30.280]  It was the United States, which isn't our government anymore.
[03:22:30.760 --> 03:22:32.380]  I'm just stating facts.
[03:22:32.380 --> 03:22:36.381]  I can't stand communists or leftism or any of this stuff.
[03:22:36.381 --> 03:22:39.442]  I'm here trying to give you a real geopolitical view into this.
[03:22:39.442 --> 03:22:52.506]  Did Georgia not blow the hell out of an entire city and massacre a bunch of Russian troops and peacekeepers out of a clear blue sky where they've been since 1991 in a ceasefire in two areas that have always been part of Russia?
[03:22:52.506 --> 03:22:55.026]  Ossetia?
[03:22:55.026 --> 03:22:56.447]  Go ahead.
[03:22:56.447 --> 03:22:57.107]  Wait a minute.
[03:22:57.107 --> 03:22:58.267]  If what you say were true,
[03:22:58.621 --> 03:23:06.003]  The first thing they would have done was blow that tunnel between Ossetia and North Ossetia.
[03:23:06.003 --> 03:23:07.044]  The Roki Tunnel.
[03:23:07.044 --> 03:23:08.944]  You can only get tanks or trucks in there.
[03:23:08.944 --> 03:23:11.585]  Hold on, what are you saying I'm lying about?
[03:23:11.585 --> 03:23:15.546]  Well, what I'm saying is... I mean, Georgia admits they snuck attack Russia.
[03:23:15.546 --> 03:23:16.486]  I doubt that.
[03:23:16.486 --> 03:23:19.888]  There were... Hold on a minute, I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:23:19.888 --> 03:23:20.928]  This is too insane.
[03:23:22.097 --> 03:23:25.398]  Okay, I mean, Georgia is startling.
[03:23:25.398 --> 03:23:27.019]  What do you say to something like this?
[03:23:27.019 --> 03:23:27.899]  Well, this is the U.S.
[03:23:27.899 --> 03:23:28.379]  media line.
[03:23:28.379 --> 03:23:29.360]  This is CNN.
[03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:30.440]  This is what Bush says.
[03:23:30.440 --> 03:23:33.921]  This is what Zalmay Khalilzad says at the United Nations.
[03:23:33.921 --> 03:23:35.682]  What McCain says and what Obama says.
[03:23:35.682 --> 03:23:36.862]  And it's a big lie.
[03:23:36.862 --> 03:23:38.643]  It's a gribbled, big lie.
[03:23:38.643 --> 03:23:40.523]  The aggressor is Georgia.
[03:23:40.523 --> 03:23:42.044]  You have whatever the status quo was.
[03:23:42.444 --> 03:23:47.706]  The Russian peacekeepers were there under a signed agreement with the Georgian government from 15 years ago.
[03:23:47.706 --> 03:23:56.629]  And let me add, the Georgians had already been taking pot shots at the Russian troops and citizens, beating people up, killing them in the outlying towns around Ossetia.
[03:23:56.629 --> 03:23:58.570]  Ethnic cleansing, that's why the Russians had to come in in 1992-93.
[03:23:58.570 --> 03:24:06.313]  And let me expand, they shut the water off to Ossetia a month ago and already had them under siege.
[03:24:07.173 --> 03:24:11.255]  And they basically had a campaign of bombings and assassinations building up to this.
[03:24:11.255 --> 03:24:14.776]  So it's a cynical, orchestrated plan by Georgia.
[03:24:14.776 --> 03:24:17.717]  Now the Russians see it coming and they say, fine, you want to attack?
[03:24:17.717 --> 03:24:19.178]  We'll be ready for you.
[03:24:19.178 --> 03:24:21.799]  And the minute they attack, they took the bridge and the tunnels.
[03:24:21.799 --> 03:24:32.763]  But look, Steve, I don't think... I would also add, ultimately, beyond all the details, you want to have your children incinerated in a thermonuclear fireball for the sake of that bandit, that little Hitler, Saakashvili?
[03:24:32.763 --> 03:24:33.403]  That's crazy.
[03:24:33.971 --> 03:24:35.152]  Look, I'm going to come back to you, Steve.
[03:24:35.152 --> 03:24:37.694]  We're going to skip this break, too, for InfoWars.com listeners.
[03:24:37.694 --> 03:24:39.255]  Got to go to those streams, folks.
[03:24:39.255 --> 03:24:42.879]  But, I mean, this is completely... Steve, I'm blown away here.
[03:24:42.879 --> 03:24:48.263]  You think I'd go on air and lie to you about Georgia attacking Russia?
[03:24:48.263 --> 03:24:50.645]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[03:24:50.645 --> 03:24:54.068]  I mean, are you serious, Steve?
[03:24:54.068 --> 03:24:55.850]  Bring Steve back up.
[03:24:55.850 --> 03:24:56.690]  He's there.
[03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:57.291]  Steve, are you there?
[03:24:59.209 --> 03:25:02.332]  All right, we're going to take a break and see if we can get Steve Reyes back up on the phone.
[03:25:02.332 --> 03:25:04.113]  Steve, it's just incredible.
[03:25:04.113 --> 03:25:09.197]  I mean, all I do is report the facts here, and I'm living in La La Land.
[03:25:09.197 --> 03:25:10.438]  More of your calls right now.
[03:25:10.438 --> 03:25:12.580]  Stay with us.
[03:25:12.580 --> 03:25:16.843]  Webster, this is just getting too crazy when people are in total denial.
[03:25:16.843 --> 03:25:18.585]  Are you still there, Steve, or did you hang up?
[03:25:20.652 --> 03:25:23.113]  I guess Steve finally dropped off.
[03:25:23.113 --> 03:25:27.775]  Steve, you can call back at 1-800-259-9231 if you can get back in.
[03:25:27.775 --> 03:25:30.757]  Webster, that is just flabbergasting.
[03:25:30.757 --> 03:25:38.200]  All the media at the footnotes, if you'll just read the bottom of the articles, admit Georgia ran a sneak attack, and he's saying we're making stuff up?
[03:25:38.200 --> 03:25:38.761]  Robert Kagan.
[03:25:39.955 --> 03:25:45.922]  The neocon Robert Kagan in the Washington Post yesterday says, we're not interested in the details of how this started.
[03:25:45.922 --> 03:25:49.046]  In other words, the massacre of 2,000 people in the middle of the night.
[03:25:49.046 --> 03:25:50.447]  Forget those details.
[03:25:50.447 --> 03:25:51.609]  Let's look at the big picture.
[03:25:52.961 --> 03:25:58.385]  Well, the Russians had to move in there, or it would have set a precedent for them to start leveraging into Russia proper.
[03:25:58.385 --> 03:26:02.888]  Imagine, this is direct killing of Russian soldiers.
[03:26:02.888 --> 03:26:07.050]  Attacking police bases, military bases, blowing the daylights out of them.
[03:26:07.050 --> 03:26:09.372]  Midnight sneak attack, admitted.
[03:26:09.372 --> 03:26:13.795]  Then CNN shows the Georgian missile launchers firing and says they're Russian.
[03:26:13.795 --> 03:26:14.916]  That's now come out.
[03:26:14.916 --> 03:26:20.019]  I mean, they treat the public like they're complete idiots, and I guess some of them really want to be lied to.
[03:26:20.899 --> 03:26:26.761]  This is the same media that brought you 9-11 and the Iraq War and Obama, and now they're trying to bring you this.
[03:26:26.761 --> 03:26:30.543]  And also the ones two years ago when the Israelis invaded Lebanon.
[03:26:30.543 --> 03:26:33.044]  We were supposed to sympathize with the Israelis.
[03:26:33.044 --> 03:26:35.525]  Yeah, they called that a Lebanese attack.
[03:26:35.525 --> 03:26:36.325]  Right.
[03:26:36.325 --> 03:26:36.805]  Same thing.
[03:26:36.805 --> 03:26:38.466]  Hezbollah is really bad, yeah.
[03:26:38.962 --> 03:26:44.168]  Alright, so this is, it's just a fraud, and the first Gulf War, and now the second Gulf War.
[03:26:44.168 --> 03:26:53.179]  Oh listen, listen, I had a news guy at the local radio station do a show at Syndicated on Sundays, kind of argue with me, and he was going, you're saying Georgia attacked?
[03:26:53.179 --> 03:26:56.583]  And I'm just going, you know what, I can't deal with this anymore, I mean, I just,
[03:26:58.146 --> 03:27:02.669]  It is also the question of the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia.
[03:27:02.669 --> 03:27:10.154]  I know the media said the Serbs attacked, when for years we had this Al-Qaeda being funded attacking.
[03:27:10.154 --> 03:27:17.599]  Yeah, you have the KLA or UCK, which is this terrorist, gun-running, drug-running, slave-running organization.
[03:27:17.599 --> 03:27:19.381]  You're supposed to sympathize with them.
[03:27:19.381 --> 03:27:22.022]  Anyway... Let's take another call.
[03:27:22.022 --> 03:27:23.323]  Rico in Toronto.
[03:27:23.323 --> 03:27:26.265]  You're on the air.
[03:27:26.265 --> 03:27:27.026]  Come on ahead, Rico.
[03:27:27.907 --> 03:27:29.408]  Okay, yeah, thanks.
[03:27:29.408 --> 03:27:34.852]  I was going to say, it seems the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[03:27:34.852 --> 03:27:39.975]  Like, for example, the illegal alien situation.
[03:27:39.975 --> 03:27:41.336]  In the late 60s, early 70s, the
[03:27:46.306 --> 03:27:47.127]  I think so.
[03:28:02.249 --> 03:28:06.651]  Yeah, so they can balkanize.
[03:28:06.651 --> 03:28:08.232]  Same thing with the Black Panthers.
[03:28:08.232 --> 03:28:09.612]  They go in and radicalize.
[03:28:09.612 --> 03:28:10.072]  Stay there, Rico.
[03:28:10.072 --> 03:28:11.813]  We're coming back on the main broadcast.
[03:28:11.813 --> 03:28:18.655]  I want to get Webster's Tarpley take on that, then I'll give you a counterpoint or another statement or question after that with Rico in Toronto, then Elliot, Jeff, Cliff, and others.
[03:28:18.655 --> 03:28:21.516]  We've got to move quick with calls, though, because I want to get a lot of your questions in.
[03:28:21.516 --> 03:28:21.837]  Here we go.
[03:28:29.667 --> 03:28:33.710]  We were just talking to Rico on the InfoWars.com behind-the-scenes streams.
[03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:38.873]  You go to InfoWars.com, those specific exclusive streams of the behind-the-scenes.
[03:28:38.873 --> 03:28:41.135]  We are talking to Rico in Toronto.
[03:28:41.135 --> 03:28:51.582]  He brought up how the big foundations fund La Raza, Mecha, the radical black separatist groups, all of this to get us all fighting with each other and so then they can radicalize peaceful groups
[03:28:52.282 --> 03:28:55.944]  So those groups never get true equality or freedom or economic mobility.
[03:28:55.944 --> 03:28:59.207]  They get neutralized, bitter, and filled with hate.
[03:28:59.207 --> 03:29:00.167]  More balkanization.
[03:29:00.167 --> 03:29:00.988]  Webster Tarbly.
[03:29:00.988 --> 03:29:05.010]  This is an absolutely critical theme, and you're absolutely right.
[03:29:05.010 --> 03:29:09.473]  If you look, first of all, at Obama, he is more than anything else a product of the foundations.
[03:29:09.473 --> 03:29:12.135]  His mother was an operative for the Ford Foundation.
[03:29:12.654 --> 03:29:25.420]  Obama has worked for the Gamaliel Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, Gun Control, the Woods Fund, the Annenberg Foundation, playing black parents against the black teachers' union.
[03:29:25.420 --> 03:29:29.881]  His friend Bernardine Dorn gets huge money from the MacArthur Foundation.
[03:29:29.881 --> 03:29:40.366]  My research for my next book, which is Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography, reveals that the Weathermen were actually founded with a Ford Foundation grant.
[03:29:40.908 --> 03:29:53.338]  Certainly Floyd McKissick, Stokely Carmichael, the worst firebrands, Rap Brown, these characters, the people who opposed Martin Luther King with their incendiary rhetoric, all foundation-funded.
[03:29:53.338 --> 03:30:03.846]  And as you correctly point out, the worst provocateurs of the Hispanic community, the people who talk this insanity about carving up the United States, they're also foundation-funded.
[03:30:03.846 --> 03:30:08.930]  Obama has friends like Khalidi and a bunch of others.
[03:30:08.930 --> 03:30:10.511]  This is the foundation-funded
[03:30:11.019 --> 03:30:14.520]  A pro-US wing of the PLO, among the Native Americans.
[03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:19.562]  You got a guy like Ward Churchill, who is essentially in the same corner.
[03:30:19.562 --> 03:30:26.724]  The pervasive activity of these foundations is one of the things that's destroying American society.
[03:30:26.724 --> 03:30:31.846]  Obama is somebody who says he was a community organizer for the Gamaliel Foundation.
[03:30:31.846 --> 03:30:39.749]  What he's really saying is, I was a poverty pimp for the foundation world, where the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation dominate.
[03:30:40.951 --> 03:30:44.593]  One of the principal things about Obama, this is what he comes from.
[03:30:44.593 --> 03:30:51.058]  His world, that stuff about the bitter clingers, the people who cling to religion and guns, and anti-trade.
[03:30:51.058 --> 03:30:54.620]  That is the foundation, trilateral point of view.
[03:30:54.620 --> 03:30:58.042]  You cannot have a president who hates the American people.
[03:30:58.042 --> 03:31:02.465]  In the case of Obama, he does hate the American people, and therefore he's going to attack
[03:31:02.952 --> 03:31:05.794]  This austerity program, with great gusto.
[03:31:05.794 --> 03:31:30.611]  Unlike Carter, who probably had some Christian scruples about it, Obama will have nothing of the sort, because he's been worshipping in a Ford Foundation church that Reverend Jeremiah Wright, with Dwight Hopkins as an operative of the Ford Foundation, Reverend Otis Moss got through college with the Ford Foundation, this whole James Cone, black liberation theology is again, the Ford Foundation Union Theological Seminary school of this stuff.
[03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:35.392]  And it is designed to perpetuate racial conflict.
[03:31:35.392 --> 03:31:49.858]  Absolutely, and they fund all these groups, they do it to get everybody at each other's throats, and then the racial tension becomes real, and then it's a dynamo which just builds up force and strength.
[03:31:49.858 --> 03:31:51.619]  Anything else, Rico?
[03:31:51.619 --> 03:32:00.363]  My second point, something that you had brought up a couple weeks ago when you were talking about the anthrax letter that the Bush enemy received.
[03:32:00.908 --> 03:32:01.089]  Yes.
[03:32:05.257 --> 03:32:07.799]  The Roman Empire.
[03:32:07.799 --> 03:32:09.240]  And it was the same thing.
[03:32:09.240 --> 03:32:10.841]  It was the same thing.
[03:32:10.841 --> 03:32:19.006]  Cicero, a little bit before Caesar came into power, Cicero was saying how the enemies of Rome need to be dealt with.
[03:32:19.006 --> 03:32:20.066]  I've received letters.
[03:32:20.066 --> 03:32:25.930]  I have letters that say that a couple senators are going to be mass assassinated, so we need to clamp down.
[03:32:25.930 --> 03:32:28.331]  This worked a thousand years ago.
[03:32:28.331 --> 03:32:29.252]  It works again.
[03:32:29.252 --> 03:32:30.333]  It's the same thing.
[03:32:31.113 --> 03:32:31.995]  Like, nothing's changed.
[03:32:42.984 --> 03:33:12.404]  And it's pretty accurate, actually, but you just look at every country and just the thousands of revolutions and all the subterfuge and backstabbing and Machiavellian activity and elites and cloak and dagger, and then somehow they taught the American people the last hundred years that none of that exists, everything's fine, go back to sleep, and if we say anything on this show, it's just start looking around you and realizing that when these elites get out of control and these warlords and these banker warlords start fighting with each other, the oligarchy as Webster calls them,
[03:33:13.284 --> 03:33:19.310]  Uh, when these moneyed, uh, you know, noble interests, uh, start battling with each other, we don't matter in the equation.
[03:33:19.310 --> 03:33:21.212]  We get hurt real bad.
[03:33:21.212 --> 03:33:23.514]  And, uh, this is just a game of chess for them.
[03:33:23.514 --> 03:33:25.876]  I mean, people say, well, why do they want more power?
[03:33:25.876 --> 03:33:26.756]  They're already so rich.
[03:33:26.756 --> 03:33:29.099]  Only body who knows rich people knows they want even more.
[03:33:29.639 --> 03:33:34.945]  They want power, they want control, and to deny that there are people that want power and control is to deny history.
[03:33:34.945 --> 03:33:44.897]  Webster, I want to go to calls quickly, but how did we get to the point, do you think, of the average person, they're now coming out of this delusion and this mesmerized smokescreen, but
[03:33:45.578 --> 03:33:50.620]  People will say, oh, there's no subterfuge, there's no corruption, there's no influence, there's no behind-the-scenes.
[03:33:50.620 --> 03:33:52.940]  You're a crazy, dangerous conspiracy theorist.
[03:33:52.940 --> 03:33:56.281]  How are they able to inculcate that in people's minds?
[03:33:56.281 --> 03:33:58.202]  Well, it's a long process of degradation.
[03:33:58.202 --> 03:34:09.345]  I think that the central question is probably the deindustrialization of the United States initiated by Volcker under trilateral Carter and Brzezinski auspices and then continued
[03:34:09.765 --> 03:34:20.869]  With the union busting of the Reagan years, the systematic decline in the standard of living, so it's about minus two-thirds of what it had been around 1966.
[03:34:20.869 --> 03:34:29.453]  And so people are having to work twice as hard just to keep the illusion going, and so they physically are just disconnected, saying, I don't care.
[03:34:29.453 --> 03:34:35.335]  There's also, more recently, Obama could not have broken through if the Democratic Party had not been in chaos.
[03:34:35.996 --> 03:34:37.997]  And part of that is Pelosi.
[03:34:37.997 --> 03:34:44.861]  Pelosi came in with the mandate of stopping the Iraq War, and she brought the... And instead she's ruled with an iron fist, saying no.
[03:34:44.861 --> 03:34:53.025]  And what we then had is, as soon as that was in power, then Al Gore comes out of the woodwork with his demagogic, fake, global warming campaign.
[03:34:53.465 --> 03:35:03.370]  To break the momentum against Bush and against the Iraq War, and then by the end of that year, you've got Obama deployed into a chaotic Democratic Party.
[03:35:03.370 --> 03:35:13.395]  Let me stop you, because I want to go to Elliot, Jeff, Cliff, and others, and DJ, but before we do that, I wanted to last hour get into the eugenics angle, which you're a real expert on, Webster.
[03:35:13.395 --> 03:35:14.496]  I mean, I know my stuff on this.
[03:35:14.496 --> 03:35:19.338]  I've read over 20 books on the subject and studied it, and you know even more in some cases than I do.
[03:35:19.338 --> 03:35:20.299]  In a nutshell,
[03:35:21.696 --> 03:35:23.398]  Why do they want to reduce our numbers?
[03:35:23.398 --> 03:35:24.879]  Why do they want to enslave us?
[03:35:24.879 --> 03:35:27.361]  Why do they want to bring feudalism back in?
[03:35:27.361 --> 03:35:31.704]  Is this just the instincts of the Anglo-American feudal lords?
[03:35:31.704 --> 03:35:37.049]  And, I mean, break that down, what the fake modern environmentalism is.
[03:35:37.049 --> 03:35:39.791]  Well, one is the population side.
[03:35:39.791 --> 03:35:43.674]  The oligarchy always argues that there are two main problems in the world.
[03:35:43.674 --> 03:35:47.798]  One is overpopulation, the other is industrial pollution in some form.
[03:35:48.616 --> 03:35:54.862]  To be an oligarch means that you've got to hate the majority of humanity by thinking that you're better off than they were.
[03:35:54.862 --> 03:36:02.469]  You can go back to the works of Hesiod in ancient Greece, pretty much the beginning of the, you know, sort of archaic Greek literature.
[03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:03.830]  Plato as well.
[03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:07.974]  The reason for the Trojan War was that there were too many people.
[03:36:07.974 --> 03:36:14.860]  Too many people were oppressing the breast of Mother Earth, and therefore we had to have the Trojan War to kill off a lot of them.
[03:36:15.293 --> 03:36:20.719]  In terms of the global warming, I don't need a climatologist to say that this is a fraud.
[03:36:20.719 --> 03:36:24.603]  As a historian, I can look back to the medieval warm period, 1100-1200.
[03:36:26.468 --> 03:36:37.336]  When you have grapes growing in England, grapes growing in... What about Hiberium Maxim 8,000 years ago, which brought us into the Bronze Age and the first city-states?
[03:36:37.336 --> 03:36:39.638]  I mean, it was 10 degrees hotter on average then.
[03:36:39.638 --> 03:36:41.679]  They have the high scores, there's no doubting it.
[03:36:41.679 --> 03:36:46.803]  We are well within the band of fluctuation of historical memory.
[03:36:46.803 --> 03:36:49.305]  The other one, of course, is we have a little Ice Age.
[03:36:49.821 --> 03:36:57.529]  Around 1600 to 1625, which corresponds to the Spera Minimum and the Maunder Minimum in the Sunspot Cycle.
[03:36:57.529 --> 03:37:00.592]  It is basically determined by solar activity.
[03:37:00.592 --> 03:37:03.595]  That's at least a major input, not by human activity.
[03:37:04.108 --> 03:37:04.589]  At all.
[03:37:04.589 --> 03:37:11.836]  And in that Little Ice Age, you had the ports of Northern Europe, the ports of Germany and the Netherlands frozen with ice, icebergs.
[03:37:11.836 --> 03:37:18.302]  So the idea of being a climatologist means you're a charlatan and a fraud because it's a discipline.
[03:37:18.302 --> 03:37:19.743]  It's not meteorology.
[03:37:19.743 --> 03:37:21.225]  It's not oceanography.
[03:37:21.225 --> 03:37:22.846]  It's not any science.
[03:37:22.846 --> 03:37:23.987]  It's not history.
[03:37:23.987 --> 03:37:26.490]  It's a fake science invented by Al Gore.
[03:37:27.003 --> 03:37:31.447]  And all during the Clinton years, if you didn't agree with Al Gore, you would be fired.
[03:37:31.447 --> 03:37:33.689]  He claims he invented the internet, too.
[03:37:33.689 --> 03:37:36.692]  He certainly is the pimp pusher of it.
[03:37:36.692 --> 03:37:43.157]  But the Club of Rome in the early 60s said they would use threat of a fake Ice Age or global warming to bring in global taxes.
[03:37:43.157 --> 03:37:47.201]  And remember, Aurelio Pichet, the co-founder, was an old fascist.
[03:37:47.805 --> 03:37:53.129]  And the other one was Alexander King, who once admitted that the purpose of this was genocide in the third world.
[03:37:53.129 --> 03:37:58.393]  He said, you know, the reason we preach this, after all, is to block development of the third world.
[03:37:58.393 --> 03:37:59.434]  That is still the same.
[03:37:59.434 --> 03:38:06.259]  And that's in the British Commission on Population, 44 to 49, which was rolled into State Department Memorandum 200.
[03:38:06.259 --> 03:38:17.568]  Yes, and beyond the 200, remember that this was all institutionalized under Carter, under Muskie, as Global 2000 and Global Futures, under Brzezinski, Trilateral, Rockefeller,
[03:38:18.303 --> 03:38:27.671]  So you basically got Kissinger as a puppet of Nelson Rockefeller, Brzezinski as a puppet of David Rockefeller, and that's pretty much the way the thing is run.
[03:38:27.671 --> 03:38:29.552]  Continue, flush that out.
[03:38:29.552 --> 03:38:38.920]  Well, then, you know, the idea of having a world population reduction idea, which is genocide, built into the U.S.
[03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:43.683]  foreign policy is this Global 2000, Global Futures, and then what do they do?
[03:38:43.683 --> 03:38:45.725]  They turn around and implement that by supporting
[03:38:46.161 --> 03:38:51.424]  Paul Pott, who goes very far, right, he's the champion in terms of proportional genocide.
[03:38:51.424 --> 03:38:56.466]  I think he manages to kill 30 to 40 percent of the Cambodian population.
[03:38:56.466 --> 03:39:02.549]  And Khomeini, who aborts the entire industrialization process of Iran.
[03:39:02.549 --> 03:39:08.852]  What they're trying to show is that third world populations can be organized against themselves to destroy themselves.
[03:39:08.852 --> 03:39:11.513]  And ultimately that's what Obama is, a fascist mass movement.
[03:39:11.846 --> 03:39:13.087]  Let's go to Elliot in Ohio.
[03:39:13.087 --> 03:39:13.587]  You're on the air.
[03:39:13.587 --> 03:39:14.628]  No, I'm afraid I haven't.
[03:39:14.628 --> 03:39:14.968]  Go ahead.
[03:39:36.184 --> 03:39:39.985]  I was on Jordan Maxwell's site and then I went to one of his links.
[03:39:39.985 --> 03:39:51.610]  In 1983, these two guys, research expert David Dodge and former Baltimore police investigator Tom Dunn, they were in the Belfast Library on the coast of Maine.
[03:39:51.610 --> 03:39:53.550]  They found a constitution from 1825
[03:39:56.025 --> 03:40:00.648]  And there was actually a missing, there's a missing 13th Amendment in our Constitution.
[03:40:00.648 --> 03:40:04.891]  It was ratified in 1819 and has not been repealed.
[03:40:04.891 --> 03:40:09.033]  There were more than 30 original broadsheets made and quite a few of them are still around.
[03:40:09.033 --> 03:40:12.956]  I've heard of, well, go ahead.
[03:40:12.956 --> 03:40:15.617]  Well, I mean, like, it's titles of nobility and honor.
[03:40:15.617 --> 03:40:21.521]  It says, if any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honor,
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:29.583]  Yeah, speak of the devil.
[03:40:29.583 --> 03:40:38.446]  John, I sent you that clip from C-SPAN of former Secretary of State Colin Powell telling the reporter that he's a night commander, order of the bath.
[03:40:38.446 --> 03:40:39.666]  Will you cue that up, please?
[03:40:39.666 --> 03:40:40.226]  I sure will.
[03:40:40.226 --> 03:40:40.547]  Thank you.
[03:40:40.547 --> 03:40:43.207]  Go ahead, Elliot.
[03:40:43.207 --> 03:40:50.150]  Yeah, retain any present pension office or emolument of any kind, whatever, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power
[03:40:50.680 --> 03:40:53.541]  Such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States.
[03:40:53.541 --> 03:40:57.603]  Yes, I'm saying you can't be a foreign agent, basically, which makes sense, and I haven't read it.
[03:40:57.603 --> 03:41:01.505]  If I may, I have a question, but now I know what you're talking about, and it does exist.
[03:41:01.505 --> 03:41:06.068]  And I wrote about this in 1996 in Executive Intelligence Review.
[03:41:06.068 --> 03:41:07.668]  You might find it on the Internet.
[03:41:07.668 --> 03:41:08.969]  It's an article that says U.S.
[03:41:08.969 --> 03:41:15.052]  Constitution bars Powell from the presidency because he had become this British nobleman.
[03:41:15.052 --> 03:41:16.453]  Yeah, we do know of it.
[03:41:16.453 --> 03:41:17.173]  The U.S.
[03:41:17.173 --> 03:41:18.674]  Constitution right now says
[03:41:19.099 --> 03:41:22.802]  You cannot hold an office of profit and trust under the United States.
[03:41:22.802 --> 03:41:27.946]  In other words, you can't be in the executive branch or the Supreme Court if you accept a title of nobility.
[03:41:27.946 --> 03:41:33.250]  And that plays into the Logan Act as a... as in the code blocking that.
[03:41:33.250 --> 03:41:34.612]  But this one goes further.
[03:41:34.612 --> 03:41:37.814]  It says if you accept such a title of nobility, you cease to be a citizen.
[03:41:37.814 --> 03:41:38.755]  Yes, it's currently in there.
[03:41:38.755 --> 03:41:39.395]  That's what I had known.
[03:41:39.395 --> 03:41:41.517]  I was ready to attack Rudy.
[03:41:41.517 --> 03:41:44.840]  Sir Rudy Giuliani would have been coming under attack from me.
[03:41:45.513 --> 03:41:48.874]  On this, if he had gotten the Republican... Yes, Elliot, that is legitimate.
[03:41:48.874 --> 03:41:49.775]  You refresh our memory.
[03:41:49.775 --> 03:41:50.115]  Thank you.
[03:41:50.115 --> 03:41:53.696]  And speaking of Powell and the nobility, here is the audio clip right now.
[03:42:01.571 --> 03:42:04.193]  We have the video clip up on InfoWars.com.
[03:42:04.193 --> 03:42:08.195]  We put it up there when Queen Elizabeth II was here in town.
[03:42:22.663 --> 03:42:22.783]  Hello?
[03:42:22.783 --> 03:42:23.444]  Yes, Cliff, go ahead.
[03:42:23.444 --> 03:42:24.064]  Yeah, how you doing today?
[03:42:50.914 --> 03:42:53.716]  Enjoying your show, by the way, also.
[03:42:53.716 --> 03:42:58.238]  My question is this, Mr. Tarpley.
[03:42:58.238 --> 03:43:16.189]  I read a report several months ago here where China sent word to Illuminati operatives that if they try to indeed, you know, make any type of move toward China, and it's, shall I say, their friends, which will be Russia and Iran via their friendship pacts they have and old obligation deals.
[03:43:18.703 --> 03:43:27.254]  What will be the next move for the Illuminati now that Bush more or less has gotten punched in the mouth by Putin over this Georgia fiasco?
[03:43:27.254 --> 03:43:30.759]  And the fact that China said, plainly stated that
[03:43:31.497 --> 03:43:39.118]  Any aggression made toward China and the people around the Illuminati would be assassinated.
[03:43:39.118 --> 03:43:40.259]  I mean, there's two questions there.
[03:43:40.259 --> 03:43:57.081]  What do you think of Benjamin Fulford, the former Forbes writer who meets with Rockefeller on video and says he's been told by the Asian elite, the mafia, that they know about the population reduction plan and the bioweapon attack plan that Cheney talks about in the PNAC documents, September 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[03:43:57.081 --> 03:43:58.802]  So, I mean, A, what do you think of that?
[03:43:58.802 --> 03:43:59.162]  And then B,
[03:44:00.963 --> 03:44:06.888]  Again, kind of a recap of why does this, you know, what does this do now that this didn't go well in Georgia?
[03:44:06.888 --> 03:44:08.009]  Let me do it the other way.
[03:44:08.009 --> 03:44:13.033]  I don't use this concept of Illuminati because I think this is just pure confusion.
[03:44:13.033 --> 03:44:19.438]  The notion that a society founded in Bavaria runs the world, in my view, is just absurd.
[03:44:19.438 --> 03:44:25.544]  What you're dealing with is the City of London, British, and Wall Street, the U.S.
[03:44:25.544 --> 03:44:26.905]  That's the operative unit.
[03:44:27.364 --> 03:44:33.170]  And these terms like New World Order and Illuminati, I think they contribute to confusion rather than clarity.
[03:44:33.170 --> 03:44:36.854]  Even though all these presidents use them and hail it and swear sovereignty.
[03:44:36.854 --> 03:44:40.217]  Yeah, look, the origin of this Illuminati, though, is British intelligence.
[03:44:40.217 --> 03:44:40.677]  I know.
[03:44:40.677 --> 03:44:44.221]  They're here to say, we're not the main enemy in the world.
[03:44:44.221 --> 03:44:46.303]  Those Bavarians are the main enemy.
[03:44:46.303 --> 03:44:47.464]  This is just crazy.
[03:44:47.464 --> 03:44:48.826]  Let me break this down for you, Webster.
[03:44:49.406 --> 03:44:51.468]  There is an element to all of this.
[03:44:51.468 --> 03:44:53.910]  The elites are obsessed with the occult.
[03:44:53.910 --> 03:45:02.797]  The British system is masonic, and they really are into this, and they really do govern a lot of what they do according to it.
[03:45:02.797 --> 03:45:12.045]  Sure, but now you're talking the Scottish Rite Freemasons of London and, you know, God knows other institutions, that they have the Club of the Isles and all sorts of other things.
[03:45:12.472 --> 03:45:14.153]  But again, this Bavarian thing.
[03:45:14.153 --> 03:45:15.754]  This is the crazy part.
[03:45:15.754 --> 03:45:18.276]  This is what the British themselves put out to say.
[03:45:18.276 --> 03:45:19.536]  Well, that was just one agent.
[03:45:19.536 --> 03:45:22.478]  That was Weisopp and the guy who got struck by lightning.
[03:45:22.478 --> 03:45:23.979]  Thank you so much.
[03:45:23.979 --> 03:45:25.640]  Wait, let's do the Fulford part.
[03:45:25.640 --> 03:45:29.082]  There is a history of secret societies in China.
[03:45:29.082 --> 03:45:40.950]  For example, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, when he wanted to do the Chinese Revolution in 1911, turned to something called the Red Door Society, the Hongmen Society.
[03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:41.350]  However,
[03:45:42.108 --> 03:45:47.529]  I think this stuff now is, you have to look at this with tremendous skepticism, and here's why.
[03:45:47.529 --> 03:45:57.172]  Suppose we have the Turkmen Islamic Party setting off some stunt in Beijing now for the Olympics.
[03:45:57.172 --> 03:46:07.354]  If that's terrorism, either Mexico City 68 or Munich 72 style, you're going to have a wave of international sympathy with China.
[03:46:08.129 --> 03:46:14.431]  Suppose now the Anglo-Americans have come up with a dialectical or two-phase false... Hold on!
[03:46:14.431 --> 03:46:20.054]  We're going to do three minutes behind the scenes exclusively at the InfoWars.com streams and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:46:20.054 --> 03:46:21.954]  Stay with us.
[03:46:21.954 --> 03:46:23.195]  Okay, you got three minutes, Webster.
[03:46:23.195 --> 03:46:27.797]  Go over this, then we're going to come back and finish up with Jeff and DJ and Matt.
[03:46:27.797 --> 03:46:28.817]  Go ahead.
[03:46:28.817 --> 03:46:36.100]  If you get the US and the British using this Turkmenistan, the tip, the Turkmenistan Islamic Party,
[03:46:36.474 --> 03:46:46.601]  And Commander Sayfullah that we've seen, pulling a stunt in Beijing, with wet work, with the bodies, then you're going to get international sympathy with China.
[03:46:46.601 --> 03:46:53.026]  Now suppose, in a second phase of a false flag, to magnify the world effect.
[03:46:53.026 --> 03:47:02.272]  It's like going from 9-11 to anthrax, which is something, you know, 9-11 is for people in big cities only, high-rises, but anthrax is for anybody who gets the mail every day.
[03:47:02.272 --> 03:47:04.834]  In other words, everybody in the world, practically,
[03:47:05.484 --> 03:47:07.406]  You can imagine a second phase.
[03:47:07.406 --> 03:47:11.209]  Now suppose the US and the British strike in Beijing.
[03:47:11.209 --> 03:47:24.362]  And then they say, um, the Chinese secret societies have given a press conference and they come forward and say, that's it, we've had it, you Anglo-Americans, we've had it up to here.
[03:47:24.795 --> 03:47:26.035]  We're striking back.
[03:47:26.035 --> 03:47:27.656]  We're going to bring down the Internet.
[03:47:27.656 --> 03:47:30.617]  We're going to destroy world financial transactions.
[03:47:30.617 --> 03:47:38.420]  We're going to paralyze the world through the Internet with logic bombs, denial of service, cyber warfare, and so forth.
[03:47:38.420 --> 03:47:45.762]  This would then begin to turn world hatred and resentment against China in a very, very strong way.
[03:47:45.762 --> 03:47:51.524]  So, I think if anybody believes that there are omnipotent Chinese secret societies, I don't think they are.
[03:47:52.145 --> 03:48:02.390]  And everybody knew about the Anglo-Americans being genocidal, you know, going back to this Kissinger memorandum of 1974, or the Carter administration.
[03:48:02.390 --> 03:48:08.673]  Now, John D. Rockefeller III has been very, you know, in his lifetime, very adamant about this stuff.
[03:48:08.673 --> 03:48:14.676]  So I don't think it makes any particular sense that there is this war of the secret societies.
[03:48:14.676 --> 03:48:21.680]  I think this is the kind of a story that I would approach with the greatest care and skepticism, because it lends itself
[03:48:22.133 --> 03:48:24.367]  To this kind of a false flag scenario.
[03:48:24.367 --> 03:48:25.775]  It's a way to popularize that.
[03:48:27.933 --> 03:48:37.297]  We know that Japan and China under the feudal system was run by secret hereditary societies, and they are dominant in many areas of life today.
[03:48:37.297 --> 03:48:52.084]  And so I think to poo-poo the reality of it is wrong, but also to give it omnipotence, as you said, I think is to overplay something that is not as... If you had some group saying, you know, we're the new Red Door Society, and we're destroying the Internet,
[03:48:52.504 --> 03:48:53.244]  Then the U.S.
[03:48:53.244 --> 03:48:55.105]  could say, all right, that's it.
[03:48:55.105 --> 03:49:03.426]  Yeah, that's another shadowy Goldstein type of wraith on which all of these other things can be hung like a scarecrow.
[03:49:03.426 --> 03:49:05.427]  Right, and it could be like Sarajevo.
[03:49:05.427 --> 03:49:08.648]  In other words, the Austrians say to Serbia, give us those criminals.
[03:49:08.648 --> 03:49:09.108]  The U.S.
[03:49:09.108 --> 03:49:15.429]  could say, okay, China, deliver us the 100 top members of the Red Door Society, and we're going to take care of them.
[03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:16.689]  The Chinese have to say no.
[03:49:16.689 --> 03:49:18.810]  We're going to come in with a final segment right now.
[03:49:18.810 --> 03:49:19.590]  I understand, Webster.
[03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.890]  Here we go.
[03:49:28.624 --> 03:49:30.767]  All right, final segment in Worldwide Transmission.
[03:49:30.767 --> 03:49:34.030]  Retransmission starts in T-minus six minutes at one place.
[03:49:34.030 --> 03:49:35.252]  Infowars.com.
[03:49:35.252 --> 03:49:37.815]  That's where you can always listen to the show.
[03:49:37.815 --> 03:49:41.259]  It'll already broadcast 20 hours, and we're back live tomorrow.
[03:49:41.259 --> 03:49:43.321]  Before we jam in, a few final calls for Webster Tarbley.
[03:49:43.321 --> 03:49:45.844]  I want to tell you about a fine sponsor, Acolabloob.
[03:49:47.293 --> 03:50:04.540]  Atmosphere water generator for home pays for itself within one year if you buy your water from the store pure clean water without the fluoride unlimited water from the humidity in the air use a solar panel system to run it or plug it into the wall machine produces up to 7.5 gallons in a day in wetter areas
[03:50:05.100 --> 03:50:10.804]  Around three gallons, at least two and a half gallons, even in the worst deserts, with the lowest humidity.
[03:50:10.804 --> 03:50:11.825]  Just an amazing system.
[03:50:11.825 --> 03:50:13.586]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[03:50:13.586 --> 03:50:15.788]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:50:15.788 --> 03:50:18.009]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:50:18.009 --> 03:50:20.731]  Natural pH.
[03:50:20.731 --> 03:50:22.593]  Give them a call.
[03:50:22.593 --> 03:50:23.313]  1-866-585-4044.
[03:50:23.313 --> 03:50:25.395]  Or check them out at acolablue.com.
[03:50:25.395 --> 03:50:27.256]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[03:50:27.256 --> 03:50:28.937]  Big banner on infowars.com.
[03:50:31.499 --> 03:50:32.159]  866-585-4044.
[03:50:32.159 --> 03:50:36.602]  Okay, let's jam in quickly here.
[03:50:36.602 --> 03:50:38.483]  Let's jam in.
[03:50:38.483 --> 03:50:40.304]  Jeff in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[03:50:40.304 --> 03:50:42.805]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[03:50:42.805 --> 03:50:44.506]  First time caller, but a long time listener.
[03:50:44.506 --> 03:50:48.308]  I'll be brief since I know you're short on time.
[03:50:48.308 --> 03:50:51.190]  This does relate to what you've been talking about.
[03:50:51.190 --> 03:50:53.071]  I read a link this morning.
[03:50:53.071 --> 03:50:54.832]  It was from the Financial Times of London.
[03:50:54.832 --> 03:50:56.373]  It was written by Peter Garnham.
[03:50:57.188 --> 03:51:00.510]  And it's just a couple sentences long.
[03:51:00.510 --> 03:51:09.016]  Ulrich Leutmann, a commerce back, said in a note that he expected the dollar to rise, quote, like a phoenix, quote unquote.
[03:51:09.016 --> 03:51:15.101]  And he also said that in a very short period of time, quote unquote, sentiment turned by 180 degrees.
[03:51:15.101 --> 03:51:16.862]  The market now believes that the U.S.
[03:51:16.862 --> 03:51:17.963]  economy, once again,
[03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:21.112]  We'll be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly.
[03:51:21.112 --> 03:51:22.954]  But they've said this three times in the last year.
[03:51:22.954 --> 03:51:26.076]  It always goes up and then further down the next time.
[03:51:26.076 --> 03:51:28.358]  I hope it goes up and they can artificially do it.
[03:51:28.358 --> 03:51:32.401]  But all the real market fundamentals show the dollar has been devalued.
[03:51:32.401 --> 03:51:33.682]  They keep printing it.
[03:51:33.682 --> 03:51:39.307]  You have this debt, liquidity, hundreds of millions a month being pumped into financial institutions.
[03:51:39.307 --> 03:51:40.888]  Webster, what do you see happening?
[03:51:40.888 --> 03:51:45.272]  The main thing you have is a violent contraction of employment and production.
[03:51:45.272 --> 03:51:46.373]  Detroit is collapsing.
[03:51:46.853 --> 03:51:48.536]  The big three automakers are collapsing.
[03:51:48.536 --> 03:51:51.060]  Their subcontractors are collapsing.
[03:51:51.060 --> 03:51:56.147]  Generally speaking, manufacturing employment in this country is really on its last legs.
[03:51:56.147 --> 03:52:00.474]  So this contraction, which is expressed in growing unemployment,
[03:52:00.896 --> 03:52:03.139]  And they're telling us everything's wonderful!
[03:52:19.446 --> 03:52:21.827]  After that, the financial panic will happen.
[03:52:21.827 --> 03:52:22.828]  They put these stories out.
[03:52:22.828 --> 03:52:28.610]  The Plunge Protection Team, of course, as everybody knows, props them up with the help of Helicopter Ben Bernanke.
[03:52:28.610 --> 03:52:39.055]  They've now got the entire Wall Street, be it JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Goldman, and Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley, and Merrill, and UBS.
[03:52:39.055 --> 03:52:40.375]  All of them are on life support.
[03:52:40.375 --> 03:52:43.657]  They're all getting huge injections of Federal Reserve.
[03:52:44.119 --> 03:52:51.245]  Liquidity, and the question is, you know, how long before that becomes generalized hyperinflation on the German 1923 model?
[03:53:06.517 --> 03:53:10.339]  An amazing two-hour, 45-minute interview with Webster Tarbley.
[03:53:10.339 --> 03:53:13.701]  I want to tell you that the new film, Fabled Enemies, I just came out with Truth Rising.
[03:53:13.701 --> 03:53:15.742]  Well, we're accelerating our info war.
[03:53:15.742 --> 03:53:18.063]  Burmese's new film, made right here, I produced it.
[03:53:18.063 --> 03:53:21.664]  Fabled Enemies, you can start pre-ordering that Thursday or Friday.
[03:53:21.664 --> 03:53:22.845]  It'll be up on the shopping cart.
[03:53:22.845 --> 03:53:24.006]  You get the DVD first.
[03:53:24.006 --> 03:53:25.766]  It ships out September 1st.
[03:53:25.766 --> 03:53:27.287]  Wink, wink, maybe a little bit early.
[03:53:27.287 --> 03:53:29.988]  It'll be on PrisonPlanet.tv September 1st.
[03:53:29.988 --> 03:53:30.549]  Well, guess what?
[03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:39.514]  You can watch the first trailer for Fabled Enemies, Berman's new film, up at the top right-hand corner of PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:53:39.514 --> 03:53:40.695]  Please spread that virally.
[03:53:40.695 --> 03:53:51.721]  I'm going to announce tomorrow who the winner of the first contest is, another on the 19th, a bigger one, for the InfoWarsPrisonPlanet.com contest.
[03:53:51.721 --> 03:53:58.105]  Listen, huge show today, Paul Kirk Roberts the first of the show, martial law news in the U.S., out of Arkansas.
