[01:31.860 --> 01:37.060]  for an article by Paul Watson another article by Kurt Nemo and a seven and a
[01:37.060 --> 01:44.060]  half minute video that is just bombshell information concerning building 7 this
[01:44.060 --> 01:49.020]  is as big as the BBC reporting the building had fallen before it fell in
[01:49.020 --> 01:54.020]  false start scripting similar to the announcing that Lee Harvey Oswald had
[01:54.020 --> 01:58.980]  shot and killed Kennedy in New Zealand Australian and Thailand papers before
[01:58.980 --> 02:03.980]  his name was even released in the US before he was even in custody false
[02:03.980 --> 02:09.620]  start scripting of black ops people say the government would make mistakes they
[02:09.620 --> 02:13.180]  do make mistakes they do get caught they just don't get brought to justice it's
[02:13.180 --> 02:18.500]  like torture of children to death is now admitted by the criminals because it's
[02:18.500 --> 02:21.420]  what they enjoy there was no reason to do that they just like jobs where they
[02:21.420 --> 02:26.540]  can do that that's where real psychos go is work for the CIA and interrogations
[02:26.540 --> 02:31.340]  but it only came out because there are good people in the government who don't

[03:54.900 --> 04:01.100]  staged event and he went on to say I know this is the majority view at the
[04:01.100 --> 04:05.020]  United Nations but he's the only guy that had the nerve to come out and say it

[08:56.660 --> 09:05.340]  news about that moment the Supreme Court is meeting as we speak they've been
[09:05.340 --> 09:13.620]  meeting for two hours they are making verbal statements on written rulings
[09:13.620 --> 09:17.900]  that is scheduled to be released either later this afternoon or tomorrow
[09:17.900 --> 09:22.220]  sometimes they wait till the next day for some reason spent quite a bit of the
[09:22.220 --> 09:26.620]  morning looking into that the history of their rulings it will probably be out
[09:26.620 --> 09:32.940]  in the next few hours in fact of me the media may be getting it now and putting
[09:32.940 --> 09:38.380]  their spin on it you with this is what will happen they will come out it will
[09:38.380 --> 09:43.620]  be announced within hours if not by tomorrow and they will say victory for
[09:43.620 --> 09:49.500]  the Second Amendment court strikes down DC gun ramp but then it will say but
[09:49.500 --> 09:53.860]  you're allowed to restrict the Second Amendment under law and then it's over
[09:53.860 --> 10:00.140]  it's all over they're coming and the fight I guess is gonna begin politically
[10:00.140 --> 10:05.260]  or maybe even physically they've never had a federal court rule they've never
[10:05.260 --> 10:10.020]  had a Supreme Court ruling saying it is an individual right the previous ruling
[10:10.020 --> 10:17.380]  said it's an absolute right it cannot be infringed cannot be touched cannot be
[10:17.380 --> 10:25.820]  altered we have seen the Congress strike down the Fourth Amendment in entirety
[10:25.820 --> 10:34.660]  last week we saw the Supreme Court come out and say oh detainees after months
[10:34.660 --> 10:41.460]  and months being held get that get to see a secret federal judge which itself is
[10:41.460 --> 10:46.060]  a total attack on habeas corpus the great red every basic canon of a free
[10:46.060 --> 10:51.060]  society classical tyranny and and and that's a propaganda move the Supreme
[10:51.060 --> 10:54.460]  Court is told what to do that they're totally controlled and that's even come
[10:54.460 --> 10:58.540]  out and admit it by the executive that fronts for the shadow government itself
[10:58.540 --> 11:03.180]  a puppet so they come out and Bush is oh I'm so mad at you Supreme Court oh you're
[11:03.180 --> 11:06.660]  so bad siding with the al-qaeda and people think oh they're a liberal good
[11:06.660 --> 11:11.500]  court liberal when it comes to the Bill of Rights the Constitution total
[11:11.500 --> 11:16.100]  boulder dash the term liberal conservative again means nothing Democrats
[11:16.100 --> 11:21.020]  come after your guns your land your property your your your free speech the
[11:21.020 --> 11:24.220]  Republicans do all the same and then they have a phony fight between
[11:24.220 --> 11:33.100]  themselves I was thinking about the Supreme Court early this morning about
[11:33.100 --> 11:39.460]  7 a.m. and then I got into the office and a few hours ago get ready here at the
[11:39.460 --> 11:46.020]  office today and I had they had unannounced that's how they do it just
[11:46.020 --> 11:50.460]  suddenly said we're meeting today to release our rulings not just on the
[11:50.460 --> 11:53.620]  second amendment on a bunch of other things and I was reading over the
[11:53.620 --> 11:58.740]  decisions they're about to release it's goes from bad to worse and I was thinking
[11:58.740 --> 12:05.460]  about how I was two weeks ago at the Supreme Court building and I would that
[12:05.460 --> 12:08.340]  the cops came out and told us we couldn't videotape the facade and I had to
[12:08.340 --> 12:11.340]  tell them it was a free country and I was allowed to and they said well you're
[12:11.340 --> 12:14.380]  not allowed to get up on the steps then with your camera and I said all those
[12:14.380 --> 12:18.180]  people have cameras and they said well we can tell your professional and they
[12:18.180 --> 12:24.780]  said you're not allowed to and I said to the guy basically look you're gonna
[12:24.780 --> 12:27.820]  just have to arrest me I'm gonna go up there with my handheld camera you can
[12:27.820 --> 12:31.180]  say no tripod no big camera but you can't selectively enforce I'm gonna go
[12:31.180 --> 12:35.980]  up there and I walk up on the big steps all the top and videotape in the front
[12:35.980 --> 12:40.900]  doors you'll see clips of this in some upcoming films a little occultic owls and
[12:40.900 --> 12:45.700]  devils carved down the walls and there's these big bronze doors shining in the
[12:45.700 --> 12:49.420]  Sun about 110 degrees up on the marble because it was a hundred degrees out
[12:49.420 --> 12:53.020]  there record Virginia heat for that time of year while we were covering
[12:53.020 --> 12:56.340]  Bilderberg we'd also run into DC and get footage of the buildings and were
[12:56.340 --> 13:01.140]  harassed as slaves of a imperial corrupt system everywhere and watch
[13:01.140 --> 13:04.380]  citizens being harassed everywhere orders being barked and treated like
[13:04.380 --> 13:09.140]  animals it's all part of the enslavement all part of the training and this
[13:09.140 --> 13:19.700]  huge black cop comes out mad you know the cop down the steps the white cop you
[13:19.700 --> 13:23.300]  know had told me I couldn't film and I just basically had to bull my way
[13:23.300 --> 13:26.780]  through this guy comes out says what are you doing filming and I hear about it's
[13:26.780 --> 13:34.900]  like turn and I hit my shin through my jeans so hard on the foot tall foot the
[13:34.900 --> 13:43.140]  the the foot of the pillar and it gashes my shin and blood starts pouring out you
[13:43.140 --> 13:50.900]  can see through my jeans and but I was so busy arguing with him about my first
[13:50.900 --> 13:55.420]  amendment and then trying to get out of there that I didn't even really notice
[13:55.420 --> 13:57.620]  it but it was kind of like this morning I was thinking about how the Supreme
[13:57.620 --> 14:02.380]  Court bit me in a way you know because being harassed by them made me make that
[14:02.380 --> 14:07.060]  quick turn and that move into the pillar and was almost like spiritual or a or a
[14:07.060 --> 14:12.100]  or a I don't know what it means I mean it probably means nothing kind of an
[14:12.100 --> 14:18.220]  omen about how evil this institution is and how bad this institution is and the
[14:18.220 --> 14:23.100]  corruption the 50 million dead babies it's responsible for just in the last 34
[14:23.100 --> 14:28.780]  years 35 years and how that was really the real fall of this country the
[14:28.780 --> 14:32.460]  devaluation of human life down to that point now the euthanasia of the old and
[14:32.460 --> 14:37.740]  the infirm and the wars and the murders and Mike Reagan talking about sexually
[14:37.740 --> 14:42.580]  murdering children I played that clip last night I'd heard he'd made the comment
[14:42.580 --> 14:46.260]  I couldn't believe it then he talked about sexually murdering them but that's
[14:46.260 --> 14:50.820]  what they do at camp x-ray and that's what they do it at Gitmo that's what
[14:50.820 --> 14:56.340]  there's two camps within x-ray that's what they do at Guantanamo Bay that's
[14:56.340 --> 15:02.900]  what they do at Abu Ghraib that's in the training manuals how to well you know
[15:02.900 --> 15:06.660]  the the acid and the objects so Mike Reagan of course is obsessed with all
[15:06.660 --> 15:15.700]  that they are a cult he talked about how he wanted to murder the children by my
[15:15.700 --> 15:22.380]  mind you say I mean can't even say on air but I don't know I was just thinking
[15:22.380 --> 15:25.300]  about the Supreme Court this morning and I thought when's that ruling gonna come
[15:25.300 --> 15:30.740]  out they won't say they always just springing on people and I remember
[15:30.740 --> 15:39.100]  thinking in the shower man they they just came out with the Congress saying
[15:39.100 --> 15:42.700]  there's no fourth amendment for any citizens for no one will all be tracked
[15:42.700 --> 15:49.180]  and traced and controlled they've got to do that retroactively and then I came in
[15:49.180 --> 15:52.900]  and there it was the Supreme Court attacking us all but but again they're
[15:52.900 --> 15:57.860]  masters at making you think everything's okay pacifying you will hear you
[15:57.860 --> 16:02.020]  will hear it today or tomorrow a victory tonight controversial ruling by the
[16:02.020 --> 16:09.980]  Supreme Court Supreme Court rules that strikes down DC gun ban coming up at
[16:09.980 --> 16:18.220]  5 live at 5 controversial Supreme Court ruling today says that citizens give
[16:18.220 --> 16:24.260]  citizens some right to bear arms that'll be the variant but but other news
[16:24.260 --> 16:31.900]  castles just a big victory for the NRA that they they never make it about the
[16:31.900 --> 16:37.260]  people or our rights because it Balkans is just better psychologically with
[16:37.260 --> 16:43.980]  behavioral psychology just to say in our a when they're actually an anti-gun
[16:43.980 --> 16:47.700]  group working from the inside to destroy it and to pacify millions of people
[16:47.700 --> 16:53.060]  that would be active in the quest to defend the second amendment you will
[16:53.060 --> 16:56.860]  hear it today by the way I told everybody what Michael Reagan was going to
[16:56.860 --> 17:02.860]  say when marked when he had Mark Dyson last Tuesday but I was on vacation so I
[17:02.860 --> 17:08.940]  didn't hear what was said until I got home Friday and I did go listen and it
[17:08.940 --> 17:14.940]  was exactly what I said go get the recording of me last Monday saying what
[17:14.940 --> 17:19.580]  Michael Reagan would say and then go somebody on YouTube can do this go and
[17:19.580 --> 17:24.980]  get the Mike Reagan and it's word for word what I said now this isn't because
[17:24.980 --> 17:28.980]  I'm smart this isn't because I'm great this isn't because it's I understand the
[17:28.980 --> 17:34.060]  enemy they have a playbook ladies and gentlemen it's just like watching the
[17:34.060 --> 17:37.740]  team you hate you love to hate in football and you know what the coach
[17:37.740 --> 17:43.820]  is gonna pull a call nine times out of ten I know their playbook and I said he
[17:43.820 --> 17:47.660]  would come on and say I've been visiting with the troops in the last few days and
[17:47.660 --> 17:53.020]  it was so upsetting to deal they said they love the war and to keep it up and
[17:53.020 --> 17:57.180]  they'd love to sacrifice and they just love America and I just got emotional and
[17:57.180 --> 18:00.660]  said kill all the 9-11 truthers and you know what they're doing is wrong and is
[18:00.660 --> 18:08.940]  treason but you know I still shouldn't talk like that and and I'm sorry exact
[18:08.940 --> 18:17.820]  words were said I know these demons minds I understand their weakness I know
[18:17.820 --> 18:24.420]  who they are okay now let me tell you what you will hear exactly today and if
[18:24.420 --> 18:28.020]  I'm wrong and I'm occasionally wrong maybe one out of a hundred times I'm wrong
[18:28.020 --> 18:31.860]  literally maybe less than one out of a hundred this is what you're gonna hear
[18:31.860 --> 18:34.380]  you're gonna hear separate through three different variants today or tomorrow
[18:34.380 --> 18:41.940]  whenever they decide to release what they've already have decided on big
[18:41.940 --> 18:50.420]  victory for the NRA and anti-gun control groups
[18:50.420 --> 18:58.020]  Supreme Court strikes down DC gunband they will then cut to someone saying
[18:58.020 --> 19:03.700]  it's horrible we're gonna have more mass shootings it's terrible then they'll cut
[19:03.700 --> 19:10.260]  to somebody saying I think it's great and they'll cut to an image of a guy
[19:10.260 --> 19:13.660]  with machine guns behind him at a gun shop to look shocking and like an
[19:13.660 --> 19:18.340]  arsenal to people I mean let me tell you exactly exactly what you're gonna see
[19:18.340 --> 19:22.060]  they're gonna come out and they're going and it's because it's a formula folks
[19:22.060 --> 19:26.140]  okay they're running at the government CBS broadcast Center runs four of the
[19:26.140 --> 19:30.460]  networks out of New York alone they send feeds to your local station and then
[19:30.460 --> 19:35.180]  they just news read over the top of it to give it a local look now let me tell
[19:35.180 --> 19:40.180]  you again they're gonna say big victory for the NRA they won't say second
[19:40.180 --> 19:44.500]  amendment they'll disassociate it from the general right because other rights
[19:44.500 --> 19:50.780]  are popular those will try to politicize it they'll try to make it
[19:50.780 --> 19:57.500]  partisan then they will at the end of it say well you do have a right to own
[19:57.500 --> 20:02.180]  guns unless prescribed by law but the government can restrict and can make
[20:02.180 --> 20:07.580]  controls on and then they'll act like that's extreme and then a rain of
[20:07.580 --> 20:14.420]  anti-gun terror will begin they didn't triple the size of the BATF for nothing
[20:14.420 --> 20:19.860]  now you will have guys at the local gun shop argue with you and say that it was
[20:19.860 --> 20:26.020]  a victory and tell you you're wrong so see we're we're up against very hard

[28:19.060 --> 28:23.180]  public relations and so he's talked about he grew up seeing how they were
[28:23.180 --> 28:28.580]  BS and people when he was a little kid 60 years ago his dad was a head spin

[35:07.620 --> 35:10.580]  magnitude of this
[35:13.220 --> 35:18.820]  have a small business get ready for Dodds eBay reporting provision buried in
[35:18.820 --> 35:24.860]  the 630 page housing bill which is very popular obviously with the mortgage
[35:24.860 --> 35:31.300]  crisis is a provision that expands know your customer and other federal laws
[35:31.300 --> 35:36.700]  that violate the fourth amendment and violate the fifth amendment and they've
[35:36.700 --> 35:42.900]  passed other laws they passed back in what four years ago it was building the
[35:42.900 --> 35:48.660]  news as a new law will give you a total privacy with your doctor and with
[35:48.660 --> 35:53.580]  medical records but in there it states that any prescription whether it's for
[35:53.580 --> 35:59.940]  diaphragm or prescription ibuprofen doesn't matter what it is that it's
[35:59.940 --> 36:04.420]  instantly uploaded to the federal government on these databases and systems
[36:04.420 --> 36:09.500]  forget a fourth amendment against a reasonable search and seizure forget a
[36:09.500 --> 36:13.380]  fifth amendment against incriminating yourselves you see we're all wired into
[36:13.380 --> 36:17.460]  the matrix we're all under surveillance and then they tell the cattle oh there
[36:17.460 --> 36:21.660]  you're not under surveillance remember bush oh we don't listen to people inside
[36:21.660 --> 36:24.420]  the US without warrants and it comes out they're listening to everybody non
[36:24.420 --> 36:37.220]  terror related and they say okay but it's to keep you safe now under this eBay
[36:37.220 --> 36:44.020]  Amazon accounts any website any a small shopping cart a lot of these people have
[36:44.020 --> 36:48.260]  shopping carts that might make $200 a year you know with little dolls they
[36:48.260 --> 36:52.340]  knit or I know all people that have their own shopping carts and might make
[36:52.340 --> 36:57.700]  $200 a year I mean gross it says you will report going to federal regulation
[36:57.700 --> 37:02.980]  have to file reports and report every transaction in live time to them total
[37:02.980 --> 37:07.740]  violation of the fourth and fifth amendment now I told you that under the
[37:07.740 --> 37:11.140]  National ID Act because I saw Ridge say it on television when he was on my
[37:11.140 --> 37:13.860]  security head and it was all the documents and it was in United Nations
[37:13.860 --> 37:20.300]  agreements from 2000 on the world ID taxation system they said that when you
[37:20.300 --> 37:27.100]  even swipe your card at a brick-and-mortar store you are going to have your
[37:27.100 --> 37:31.860]  name attached to even the cash that you're using so so you may pay with cash
[37:31.860 --> 37:35.660]  they're gonna swipe your car and the ostensible reason will be well we've
[37:35.660 --> 37:41.140]  got to decide which tax bracket you're in for sales tax but the and they've
[37:41.140 --> 37:45.220]  also proposed and have tried to pass at the state level at the international
[37:45.220 --> 37:49.460]  level in Europe's actually doing this in many countries to then whatever you do
[37:49.460 --> 37:53.180]  on the web is instantly uploaded to a government website and then they
[37:53.180 --> 37:58.620]  surveil your account and the accounts of the software that by law they want to
[37:58.620 --> 38:02.460]  be built to automatically report where you don't even have a choice that's the
[38:02.460 --> 38:07.020]  next step eBay and Amazon and others are already reporting on people that have
[38:07.020 --> 38:12.220]  sub pages and are selling and using them as a merchant and so this will go into
[38:12.220 --> 38:17.620]  all cash registers all brick-and-mortar stores and that's only one remember two
[38:17.620 --> 38:22.100]  weeks ago I went over the five pronged attack to destroy the internet and I
[38:22.100 --> 38:27.140]  said taxation regulation over every shopping cart taxation over emails
[38:27.140 --> 38:31.180]  taxation over bandwidth and then I heard local talk show hosts in Austin
[38:31.180 --> 38:34.300]  endorsing it saying oh this is a wonderful idea you know these people are
[38:34.300 --> 38:40.580]  getting the web for free you haven't to pay even more taxes and have everything
[38:40.580 --> 38:44.380]  you do tracked and traced and have the power of even reporting on yourself
[38:44.380 --> 38:47.060]  which violates the Fifth Amendment and Fourth Amendment that just be being
[38:47.060 --> 38:52.940]  taken away that is not a good thing so first there's been denial about all this
[38:52.940 --> 38:58.980]  and now it's happening and people are maybe gonna wake up to it so I want to
[38:58.980 --> 39:05.100]  spend 10 minutes the next hour going through this but that that's also in the
[39:05.100 --> 39:10.900]  news have a small business get ready for Dodds eBay reporting provision now that
[39:10.900 --> 39:14.180]  Congress has all that decimated the Fourth Amendment with the intrusive so
[39:14.180 --> 39:18.460]  called FISA bill it's time to go after small businesses deep in Senator
[39:18.460 --> 39:22.260]  Christopher Dodds 630 page Senate housing legislation is a sweeping
[39:22.260 --> 39:25.740]  provision that affects the privacy and operation really all American small
[39:25.740 --> 39:29.740]  businesses the provision which was added by the bills managers without debate
[39:29.740 --> 39:33.940]  this week that's outside of committee folks they add it right at the end would
[39:33.940 --> 39:37.900]  require the nation's payment systems to track aggregate and report information on
[39:37.900 --> 39:41.540]  nearly every electronic transaction to the federal government explains freedom
[39:41.540 --> 39:47.540]  works now this big what public watchdog group read the bill they didn't they did
[39:47.540 --> 39:51.820]  a decent job but but I've now analyzed it let me explain remember I've been
[39:51.820 --> 40:00.020]  telling you you heard about the governor of New York made a $10,000 transfer and
[40:00.020 --> 40:03.740]  his bank reported it to the FBI and that's how the prostitution sting started
[40:03.740 --> 40:07.860]  number one that's not true was under surveillance before that but and then I
[40:07.860 --> 40:11.660]  came on there and I said no no no the banks are illegally and that's why
[40:11.660 --> 40:15.020]  they're trying to pass legislation everything you do is uploaded the
[40:15.020 --> 40:19.900]  government's in all of the banks databases kind of like I told you in
[40:19.900 --> 40:23.980]  1996 the NSA doesn't tap your phones people think when there's water in the
[40:23.980 --> 40:28.060]  lines or a tree falls down a thing and it clicks you know in some phone system a
[40:28.060 --> 40:31.220]  hundred miles away that that's the government listening no that's a local
[40:31.220 --> 40:34.500]  tap if you're hearing clicking or a private eye doing it down the street
[40:34.500 --> 40:38.220]  from your house or under your house with a tap that's the only time you hear
[40:38.220 --> 40:44.140]  clicking and stuff okay you don't hear clicking it the NSA doesn't tap the
[40:44.140 --> 40:48.380]  phone companies they are the phone companies nine billion dollars of whole
[40:48.380 --> 40:53.740]  hubs in 96 97 98 99 put in everywhere and then it came out a year and a half ago
[40:53.740 --> 40:58.940]  and now it's on front line breaking news oh my gosh whole floors at AT&T and
[40:58.940 --> 41:05.100]  everybody else or NSA everything runs through it all I did was read the
[41:05.100 --> 41:10.340]  telecommunications act the deregulation of 96 I mean I it said by
[41:10.340 --> 41:14.060]  October 1st every cell phone would be tracked in live time off GPS
[41:14.060 --> 41:20.020]  triangulation not GPS in the phone GPS on the cell towers triangulating you down
[41:20.020 --> 41:23.580]  to three feet listening to you tracking you and they even people denied that was
[41:23.580 --> 41:26.260]  happening when I had all the documents and then they advertise it to you oh
[41:26.260 --> 41:31.700]  track your kids track yourself track your husband so now they're even making
[41:31.700 --> 41:35.860]  money off of the government tracking system that's on you but someone who
[41:35.860 --> 41:38.780]  even knows that their phone tracks them will still deny that the government
[41:38.780 --> 41:44.100]  designed it or by law ordered that be put in you see this is the mega massive
[41:44.100 --> 41:47.100]  complete denial I mean I have the government documents where they put
[41:47.100 --> 41:50.060]  cancer viruses in your vaccines where they said they want to kill you and your
[41:50.060 --> 41:52.860]  family where they say they want to brain damage you we've made films we've
[41:52.860 --> 41:55.620]  covered them we've read them I read some on the area yesterday people just say
[41:55.620 --> 42:01.220]  not true usually it's not my opinion people say well you shouldn't get so
[42:01.220 --> 42:07.860]  upset how can I rationally not get upset by what's happening when I know it's
[42:07.860 --> 42:13.180]  destroying our whole future that I know that I'm living in a false reality by
[42:13.180 --> 42:18.060]  that the general public is in a false reality they have no idea the magnitude
[42:18.060 --> 42:24.620]  of what the global engineers have built and are building around them okay so I'm
[42:24.620 --> 42:31.060]  gonna get more into that later it's just completely diabolical the average cop
[42:31.060 --> 42:34.540]  can't see it the average FBI guy the average school teacher the average
[42:34.540 --> 42:42.180]  banker can't see it it is so diabolical it is at the scientist think tank level
[42:42.180 --> 42:45.940]  and there are thousands of people that plan this who do know the full picture
[42:45.940 --> 42:49.540]  and then a few hundred owners and that's it and they control it they guide the
[42:49.540 --> 42:54.100]  whole thing it's institutionalized they do it in upgrades globally you'll see
[42:54.100 --> 42:58.780]  the same system even of the same name put in with the welfare workers and the
[42:58.780 --> 43:02.460]  surveillance and it's all being put into place in every step they said they
[43:02.460 --> 43:07.740]  follow their following towards releasing controlled bio weapons releases which
[43:07.740 --> 43:11.300]  they'll then use to claim that terrorist hit us any more security tighten down
[43:11.300 --> 43:16.300]  us more hit us even harder a few years later tighten down more and as the last
[43:16.300 --> 43:20.780]  of you are being killed in your compact bunker cities the cops dying around you
[43:20.780 --> 43:23.780]  out in the streets won't even know it's their government doing it's their
[43:23.780 --> 43:28.940]  global system it's their masters they'll be looking under beds for Osama or for
[43:28.940 --> 43:33.220]  whatever new terror group it is never knowing it's their masters killing now
[43:33.220 --> 43:41.140]  I don't want to spend a lot of time on this right now because you'll have a lot
[43:41.140 --> 43:46.460]  of time but we're gonna take this clip right now and put it on to the Barry
[43:46.460 --> 43:50.380]  Jennings video and then put that out because I want to expand on the points
[43:50.380 --> 43:55.620]  that Bermas made in the video that's up on in full wars in prison planet okay so
[43:55.620 --> 44:01.580]  there have been major new developments and if you go to info wars.com you can
[44:01.580 --> 44:05.300]  see those big new developments in the 9-11 truth movement emergency official
[44:05.300 --> 44:10.780]  witness dead bodies in the World Trade Center by Paul Joseph Watson at info
[44:10.780 --> 44:16.500]  wars.com Kurt Nemo has the story bodies in WTC 7 Jennings interview demolishes
[44:16.500 --> 44:19.660]  official version let me briefly tell you what happened then I'm gonna throw it
[44:19.660 --> 44:24.540]  over to Bermas and we're gonna play the clip of Barry Jennings Barry Jennings was
[44:24.540 --> 44:29.820]  the deputy head of emergency management there for New York City he went into
[44:29.820 --> 44:35.100]  building seven there were steaming coffee sandwiches they were told get out
[44:35.100 --> 44:38.500]  of the building with a phone call they get out there's explosions that have
[44:38.500 --> 44:43.900]  gone off stepping over dead bodies and this is before either north or south
[44:43.900 --> 44:52.860]  tower 110 story towers had fallen so he had told some local news that on record
[44:52.860 --> 44:59.260]  that day so Jason Bermas and Dylan Avery and Corey Rove they go out a year ago
[44:59.260 --> 45:03.060]  for loose change final cut they interview they play little clips on air but
[45:03.060 --> 45:08.700]  don't say who he is and suddenly he gets threats they threaten to fire him he all
[45:08.700 --> 45:12.740]  this stuff happens and so even though he agrees that we can use it and we have
[45:12.740 --> 45:16.260]  that contrastually him agreeing to use it and would it be important for the
[45:16.260 --> 45:21.980]  movement important to get it out we didn't put it out I was the one of the
[45:21.980 --> 45:27.780]  second producers on loose change final cut then the BBC backpacks who it is
[45:27.780 --> 45:32.660]  this guy Smith guy who came interviewed me into this hit piece a previous hit
[45:32.660 --> 45:35.620]  piece on 9-11 I'd say what about Northwoods what about US troops massing
[45:35.620 --> 45:38.980]  to invade Afghanistan a week before what about all the he would know no that's
[45:38.980 --> 45:42.100]  not going in the piece total hit piece then at the end of it he said it was
[45:42.100 --> 45:45.140]  fair and balanced at the end he just laughed at me and told me I was a nut
[45:45.140 --> 45:50.580]  and it was a big joke I mean totally disingenuous then I about a month ago I
[45:50.580 --> 45:54.500]  was on BBC radio debating him and he said he was involved in this new
[45:54.500 --> 45:59.060]  building seven pieces coming out and they interviewed Barry Jennings for it
[45:59.060 --> 46:02.900]  we've seen the trailer now a few months ago they interviewed Dylan Avery and
[46:02.900 --> 46:08.260]  Denver for this and the same guy Smith and he comes over and says I hear it's
[46:08.260 --> 46:14.380]  a lie I hear that you guys are making it up that Barry Jennings said that he was
[46:14.380 --> 46:17.540]  stepping over bodies and building seven or there were explosions and I hear
[46:17.540 --> 46:21.460]  there's not video of him well Dylan happened to have it on his phone and
[46:21.460 --> 46:24.900]  played it and tried to play for the cameras I'll bet bottom dollar unless
[46:24.900 --> 46:27.980]  they pull it and re-edit it we exposed the history channel when they did delay
[46:27.980 --> 46:31.260]  it a few weeks and didn't change some stuff because I pointed out that hers
[46:31.260 --> 46:34.940]  publishing owned it and that I had heard they had an ad for the book not letting
[46:34.940 --> 46:38.260]  them know it was conflict of interest and so they did have to go cut that out
[46:38.260 --> 46:43.180]  of the of the hit piece so they may go try to change this now but but but what
[46:43.180 --> 46:47.100]  we've been told is basically they edit craftily and Jennings have been
[46:47.100 --> 46:50.620]  pressured he said well it looked like bodies I thought it was bodies it might
[46:50.620 --> 46:55.580]  not have been bodies I'm I meant the stuff on the floor was like bodies you
[46:55.580 --> 46:59.580]  know and and Dylan says no here's the clip so we went on record they were
[46:59.580 --> 47:05.220]  shown this clip they were shown what you're about to hear Jason you did a
[47:05.220 --> 47:08.500]  great job on that YouTube video you and Aaron put up it's up on info wars but in
[47:08.500 --> 47:12.220]  the next six seven hours we're gonna get a new video up with this info and this is
[47:12.220 --> 47:17.180]  what's important people need to understand that that that we had to put this video
[47:17.180 --> 47:21.300]  out because now they're gonna try to misrepresent or spin what Jennings has
[47:21.300 --> 47:24.700]  been saying when all along you guys saw him on the news say something similar
[47:24.700 --> 47:30.940]  you just went and got the interview with him and the the the BBC is also gonna
[47:30.940 --> 47:34.620]  try to cover up why they announced building seven fell a lot of stuff's
[47:34.620 --> 47:39.860]  happening Jason absolutely I mean we got this interview last year in June
[47:39.860 --> 47:44.540]  actually and he was a really nice guy he had seen the loose change second
[47:44.540 --> 47:48.180]  edition he'd even played it in his office for other co-workers you know he
[47:48.180 --> 47:51.140]  didn't believe the official version at all it's very apparent in the interview
[47:51.140 --> 47:55.500]  that we do even in the little bits and pieces we put out there and he did say
[47:55.500 --> 47:59.100]  that you know those explosions happened prior to either building collapse he was
[47:59.100 --> 48:03.700]  trapped on the eighth floor until about 1231 on the afternoon and when they did
[48:03.700 --> 48:07.260]  get him down into the lobby he was stepping over bodies I mean it's as
[48:07.260 --> 48:10.980]  clear as day and we know that the official version the 9-11 Commission
[48:10.980 --> 48:13.980]  report and 9-11 Commissioners have said there was no loss of life in that
[48:13.980 --> 48:17.140]  building well we know there was loss of life in that building it was just an
[48:17.140 --> 48:20.900]  excuse for them that came out years later that Secret Service agents and
[48:20.900 --> 48:25.340]  others did die that's right and there's bombs going off explosions nothing in
[48:25.340 --> 48:27.940]  any of the other buildings should the other towers are smoking they haven't
[48:27.940 --> 48:32.460]  collapsed and there's explosions going off I guess to clear people out of there
[48:32.460 --> 48:36.060]  and they're saying don't look down and he looks you know and there's bodies that
[48:36.060 --> 48:39.780]  he's stepping over and and the larger issue here is when we said we had this
[48:39.780 --> 48:44.340]  interview the debunkers who were congenital liars admit that they lie to
[48:44.340 --> 48:47.340]  fool the public they said we were liars and said that we didn't have this tape
[48:47.340 --> 48:51.220]  then they said Jennings didn't say that now they've got the BBC coming out and
[48:51.220 --> 48:55.060]  saying that so we have to set the record straight and put this out but it's not
[48:55.060 --> 48:58.540]  just Jennings it's other firefighters police emergency workers saying there
[48:58.540 --> 49:01.980]  was a countdown to bring seven down later yeah absolutely that's the Kevin
[49:01.980 --> 49:06.900]  McCat McPadden story but when you look at it I mean this this is a 47 story
[49:06.900 --> 49:11.140]  skyscraper it is a ultra spook house we have the largest CIA base outside of
[49:11.140 --> 49:14.700]  Langley we have the largest Secret Service office in the world and the two
[49:14.700 --> 49:20.420]  emergency workers that went up there Barry Jennings and Michael Hess went to
[49:20.420 --> 49:24.060]  an abandoned office of emergency management and this should have been
[49:24.060 --> 49:28.220]  fully manned they were both shocked to see that there was you know still hot
[49:28.220 --> 49:32.180]  coffee half eaten sandwiches Michael Hess was actually there to meet Giuliani
[49:32.180 --> 49:36.180]  who had gotten a warning to get out that morning although that's not on the
[49:36.180 --> 49:40.620]  YouTube clip Barry Jennings does mention that Hess was there to see Giuliani and
[49:40.620 --> 49:44.500]  was freaking out because he didn't he couldn't get a hold of the mayor so why
[49:44.500 --> 49:50.140]  was this office of emergency management totally evacuated and why is it that
[49:50.140 --> 49:53.820]  someone called Barry and once he found out he was in seven told him to
[49:53.820 --> 49:57.740]  immediately leave if there was no threat yeah we need another article at
[49:57.740 --> 50:02.660]  prison planet you know that basically headline you know emergency manager says
[50:02.660 --> 50:06.980]  bombs and millings dead bodies you know why this is an why this is an important
[50:06.980 --> 50:11.020]  interview you know a they're trying to suppress it and spin it be they said it
[50:11.020 --> 50:14.660]  didn't exist see he cooperates what other people are saying he's an
[50:14.660 --> 50:18.820]  emergency manager deputy head I mean you start adding all this together he's
[50:18.820 --> 50:22.100]  corroborating the bombs he's cooperating big explosions and dead bodies
[50:22.100 --> 50:27.020]  before either of the two towers you know hundreds of yards away collapse it's
[50:27.020 --> 50:30.940]  just absolutely amazing and now they've obviously pressured him and gone and
[50:30.940 --> 50:33.780]  interviewed him but watching some of the clips online it sounds like he almost
[50:33.780 --> 50:37.100]  says the same thing but then they just tell you oh that's not what you really
[50:37.100 --> 50:41.980]  heard kind of like the spin that that the producer of this new hit piece guy
[50:41.980 --> 50:45.340]  Smith when I was debating on radio he said well they knew the building was
[50:45.340 --> 50:49.540]  gonna come down all day so BBC just got it wrong and said that it already come
[50:49.540 --> 50:53.060]  down you know magically three buildings never collapsed from fire the
[50:53.060 --> 50:57.860]  modern still buildings now three of them do and then magically BBC and CNN say
[50:57.860 --> 51:01.060]  it's collapsed in its own footprint a total collapse and then they give the
[51:01.060 --> 51:06.540]  official collapse I mean it's like them trying to make excuses about New Zealand
[51:06.540 --> 51:11.140]  Australian and Thailand newspapers reporting before Lee Harvey Oswald was
[51:11.140 --> 51:15.100]  even captured before his name was out in the US having it printed that Lee
[51:15.100 --> 51:18.980]  Harvey Oswald shot the president well they got a time zone off by an hour and
[51:18.980 --> 51:22.780]  that's admitted I mean you guys can't get away with this stuff I mean you run your

[54:38.180 --> 54:49.700]  for back live ladies and gentlemen huge 9-11 developments we need your help
[54:49.700 --> 54:54.180]  getting this story out Barry Jennings deputy head of the office of emergency
[54:54.180 --> 55:00.060]  management in New York City on the day 9-11 he came out and said man there were
[55:00.060 --> 55:03.780]  bombs things going off dead people in building seven before either tower fell
[55:03.780 --> 55:08.500]  the media covered that up Jason Burma's Dylan Avery the loose change crew they
[55:08.500 --> 55:11.940]  went they interviewed him they're gonna put it in loose change final cut they
[55:11.940 --> 55:16.860]  just made noises about somebody high up in the emergency system saying this the
[55:16.860 --> 55:20.740]  establishment figured out who it was and went and threatened him threatened his
[55:20.740 --> 55:24.820]  job things like that he called Dylan and others and told them that said I know I
[55:24.820 --> 55:29.740]  said you can use it but please don't put it your film and even though we had a
[55:29.740 --> 55:33.020]  moral responsibility to put it out there buddy I argued against it but I wasn't
[55:33.020 --> 55:36.980]  gonna try to even though I was executive producer and probably have you know made
[55:36.980 --> 55:41.820]  him do it I said fine this is a big mistake and then the neocons came out
[55:41.820 --> 55:47.180]  so we were liars we didn't have this interview I didn't exist Barry Jennings
[55:47.180 --> 55:51.260]  never said that and then there's this BBC guy who did this big disingenuous hit
[55:51.260 --> 55:54.740]  piece told me it wasn't a hit piece but then a few days into the interview with
[55:54.740 --> 55:59.900]  him this is a part two he's doing on building seven last year he just starts
[55:59.900 --> 56:03.420]  laughing at me and saying I think you're nuts and I mean literally just laughing
[56:03.420 --> 56:07.220]  with his crew and I was like whoa I've never had this happen I mean literally
[56:07.220 --> 56:10.420]  just like giggling and I'd say but what about building seven you know what
[56:10.420 --> 56:15.500]  about building seven what about Operation Northwoods what about how the US
[56:15.500 --> 56:20.020]  masked all these troops to invade Afghanistan the months before and he
[56:20.020 --> 56:23.500]  just said we're not putting that in film he just would laugh at me and then they
[56:23.500 --> 56:28.340]  went and said that the loose change guys had said that there was paper found in a
[56:28.340 --> 56:32.980]  lake that was only a mile away but that we use map quests and it showed four
[56:32.980 --> 56:37.220]  miles when we never said that the Associated Press and others said eight
[56:37.220 --> 56:41.380]  miles away eyewitnesses said that who people have interviewed there was news
[56:41.380 --> 56:45.500]  footage of it so it was all straw men just made up that's what they do they
[56:45.500 --> 56:50.100]  make up stuff we haven't said or they go get cookie 9-11 truth groups who are
[56:50.100 --> 56:55.940]  operatives are mentally ill and then say that we are saying what they say and so
[56:55.940 --> 57:01.060]  I again debated guy Smith on the radio and he said told me a few months ago yeah
[57:01.060 --> 57:06.020]  I got a BBC piece on building seven coming out and I said oh yeah and BBC
[57:06.020 --> 57:11.300]  says they've lost the tapes of that day when they announced that the building
[57:11.300 --> 57:16.020]  fell building seven before it did 25 minutes and he said real slightly oh we
[57:16.020 --> 57:20.260]  found them again and giggled we ought to get those clips off that interview see
[57:20.260 --> 57:23.380]  how funny it is they had five to one debating me on that show and would fade
[57:23.380 --> 57:27.580]  me down and wouldn't give me any time but but that's the point when people
[57:27.580 --> 57:32.100]  demanded the tapes because at first BBC was denying it was real then they said
[57:32.100 --> 57:35.780]  okay it is real but we don't have the tapes and they said oh we found them and
[57:35.780 --> 57:39.820]  then he giggles it's very funny you know to manipulate the slaves to be on a
[57:39.820 --> 57:46.780]  power trip and then they're now putting this out and they supposedly have buried
[57:46.780 --> 57:51.780]  Jennings debunking in that so we've just put the video out a bunch of it there's
[57:51.780 --> 57:55.500]  more we'll be putting out it'll be in the film fabled enemies but but that's
[57:55.500 --> 57:59.100]  only one issue of why we're releasing this the other keys here I mean the
[57:59.100 --> 58:02.660]  bombs in the building the fact that there was explosions before tower one or
[58:02.660 --> 58:05.620]  two fell the fact that Giuliani was out of the building the fact they were told
[58:05.620 --> 58:08.980]  get out of the building the fact Giuliani later admitted that then denied he
[58:08.980 --> 58:12.900]  said it and then had to admit it see I mean we've caught him here folks yeah
[58:12.900 --> 58:17.260]  absolutely and another big issue is that supposedly the 9-11 Commission found no
[58:17.260 --> 58:21.620]  evidence of this this is what Thomas Kean set out in Texas and we have it in
[58:21.620 --> 58:25.460]  loose change final cut well how could they have no evidence of dead bodies
[58:25.460 --> 58:28.060]  when they talked to Barry Jennings how could they have no evidence of
[58:28.060 --> 58:31.820]  explosions in the building prior to either tower collapse when they talked
[58:31.820 --> 58:36.500]  to Barry Jennings and it was several several years after the incident so
[58:36.500 --> 58:40.860]  this was for the 9-11 Commission yet it's it's odd his testimony didn't make the
[58:40.860 --> 58:44.660]  final report and building 7 is only in a footnote and never actually discussed
[58:44.660 --> 58:48.900]  well that's why this is a big deal there was a attempted cover-up of this out of
[58:48.900 --> 58:52.740]  the goodness of our own hearts and the guy saying please don't do this we said
[58:52.740 --> 58:57.340]  okay you want a private life we will do the right thing for you the wrong thing
[58:57.340 --> 59:00.780]  for the country in the world but then he goes it does the interview uh-huh gloves
[59:00.780 --> 59:05.220]  are off here it is this is a cover-up unraveling did you just hear what Jason

[59:29.260 --> 59:32.900]  first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up it is essential

[1:00:37.580 --> 1:00:45.620]  answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live
[1:00:45.620 --> 1:00:52.620]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones we're gonna play the very Jennings clip here in
[1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:58.460]  just a moment but recapping Burmese in the next four and a half minutes
[1:00:58.460 --> 1:01:04.500]  break down why we're doing this and why it is important and why it's so big for
[1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:08.580]  listeners to get this video out to everybody to explain to everyone why
[1:01:08.580 --> 1:01:12.900]  this is so important all it is very important for the listeners to get this
[1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:17.580]  out because this totally and completely eviscerates the official version as of
[1:01:17.580 --> 1:01:21.540]  the 9-11 Commission report without a doubt so let's go through the points
[1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:26.420]  here what happened to Barry Jennings point one he was called after the first
[1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:31.100]  plane strike okay so he was in the building prior to the second plane
[1:01:31.100 --> 1:01:34.740]  strike that is also in the video now when he's taken up to the office of
[1:01:34.740 --> 1:01:39.980]  emergency management on the 23rd floor he is with Michael Hess who is the city
[1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:44.820]  corporation council at the time and now heads up Giuliani partners when they go
[1:01:44.820 --> 1:01:49.780]  up to the office of emergency management which should have been fully manned it
[1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:54.940]  had been deserted okay now the elevators were all shut off they had been taken up
[1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:59.140]  by a police triage that was already at the building through a freight elevator
[1:01:59.140 --> 1:02:04.700]  so Michael has found the stairwell they start going down the stairwell again
[1:02:04.700 --> 1:02:08.340]  this is prior to either tower collapsing and there is a huge explosion from
[1:02:08.340 --> 1:02:12.020]  underneath them that pushes them back to the eighth floor now this is all on
[1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:15.820]  record now they're stuck in that building hearing all types of explosions
[1:02:15.820 --> 1:02:20.220]  thinking that they're going to die until about 12 30 to 1 in the afternoon when
[1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:25.180]  the firefighters finally do come down to get them they come to a lobby that is
[1:02:25.180 --> 1:02:28.500]  unrecognizable that is blown to kingdom come and this is very important too
[1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:32.220]  because in this little video in the wrap-up I show you what the Millennium
[1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:35.940]  Hilton looks like the next day not only on the facade on the outside but I take
[1:02:35.940 --> 1:02:39.100]  you inside the Millennium Hill and we're literally there still vases the
[1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:44.340]  couches are okay by the way we also have video of the front of building 7 and
[1:02:44.340 --> 1:02:47.980]  it's got a few windows knocked down and we know the popper mechanics is showing
[1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:52.740]  a gray faced building that's got the corner knocked out when the building 7
[1:02:52.740 --> 1:02:56.540]  was red it's a fake I mean it doesn't the folks that gave you the Remington
[1:02:56.540 --> 1:03:00.580]  photos for the Spanish-American War I mean there's no end to these people that
[1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:03.540]  that's that seems to be the case there seems to be no video co-op or
[1:03:03.540 --> 1:03:07.060]  corroboration whatsoever for that quote-unquote chunk of the building missing
[1:03:07.060 --> 1:03:11.580]  now we also show you in this video footage after at least one of the towers
[1:03:11.580 --> 1:03:15.740]  have has collapsed of inside building 7 where they literally run up to the main
[1:03:15.740 --> 1:03:20.060]  lobby from the south face now the south face has a couple windows knocked out
[1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:24.540]  but it's not this towering inferno there's not quote-unquote 25% of the
[1:03:24.540 --> 1:03:30.540]  building scooped out now another big point is the fact that when Barry Jennings
[1:03:30.540 --> 1:03:34.620]  and Michael Hescott out of the building they both went on separate local news
[1:03:34.620 --> 1:03:40.620]  programs and told the exact same story it was never followed up upon it was only
[1:03:40.620 --> 1:03:45.900]  until years later when we put two and two together that the man Barry Jennings
[1:03:45.900 --> 1:03:49.500]  who was in the FEMA report describing these explosions which was brushed off
[1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:53.900]  as the first tower falling was the same man that was on the videos with Michael
[1:03:53.900 --> 1:03:56.820]  Hescott. And you went and interviewed him and said no there were explosions
[1:03:56.820 --> 1:04:01.500]  before either tower fell again proving more lies in the commission I mean this
[1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:05.820]  is so key folks. Absolutely and he says that there were many many explosions and
[1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:09.860]  said even when he had gotten out of the building at one in the afternoon he was
[1:04:09.860 --> 1:04:14.540]  told that he had to get down I think 10 or 20 blocks and run because they were
[1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:20.740]  having reports of more explosions at the time. Now let's be clear all day they're
[1:04:20.740 --> 1:04:24.220]  announcing it's gonna explode it's gonna fall get back we know they keep back in
[1:04:24.220 --> 1:04:27.940]  the time up for it they finally do bring it down and we have cops saying get back
[1:04:27.940 --> 1:04:31.260]  they're gonna bring the building down it's about to blow up and then they say
[1:04:31.260 --> 1:04:33.900]  well they just knew it was about to blow up because they knew it was about to
[1:04:33.900 --> 1:04:36.940]  collapse how are they saying get back get back it's about to blow it's about
[1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:41.340]  falls down I mean this is this is two plus two equals four now we have
[1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:44.540]  Silverstein saying pull the building that means a controlled demolition in
[1:04:44.540 --> 1:04:48.140]  their own documentary they had met that I mean we've got them this is this is
[1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:51.780]  unbelievable they can ignore all these EMTs and police saying get back they're
[1:04:51.780 --> 1:04:56.700]  gonna blow it they can ignore you know all these eyewitnesses even Amy Goodman
[1:04:56.700 --> 1:05:00.140]  saying investigate it further but they can't ignore their own deputy head of
[1:05:00.140 --> 1:05:03.140]  emergency management saying that's right and that's why they have to spin it
[1:05:03.140 --> 1:05:06.340]  they have to put it in with other information disinformation and
[1:05:06.340 --> 1:05:12.540]  misinformation in order to try to distort his story and to finish up here we
[1:05:12.540 --> 1:05:15.300]  probably need to add that to the clip that he's a fan of you guys seeing the
[1:05:15.300 --> 1:05:18.820]  film so that adds the fact he's saying inside job I mean that's that that's the
[1:05:18.820 --> 1:05:22.780]  overall what you got from him oh when we were there he was the boss of the
[1:05:22.780 --> 1:05:27.420]  department stay there I want to hear more about this sure stay there

[1:09:01.460 --> 1:09:05.700]  be taken to secret camps and tortured morning Joe the military needs to be
[1:09:05.700 --> 1:09:11.900]  used against us 9-11 truth must die and now Michael Reagan ninth largest radio
[1:09:11.900 --> 1:09:15.420]  host in the country according to talkers magazine and others four million
[1:09:15.420 --> 1:09:20.780]  listeners per day shed kill mark dice kill 9-11 truthers if they talk to the
[1:09:20.780 --> 1:09:24.300]  military they engage their first amendment and expose 9-11 as an inside
[1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:29.260]  job murder them he has not been fired he has not gotten in trouble if any of us
[1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:33.940]  shed kill people we would be arrested within hours if we should go out kill
[1:09:33.940 --> 1:09:39.100]  him I mean it I'm serious I'll pay for it kill him we'd be arrested so we know
[1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:42.580]  this is serious because look they understand they're protecting a system
[1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:46.060]  most of them know their bosses carried it out that makes them even scared her
[1:09:46.060 --> 1:09:49.020]  that's why Congress goes ahead and does what they're told it's not just the pay
[1:09:49.020 --> 1:09:53.140]  offs of the money in the corruption I mean it's scary folks we're in a very
[1:09:53.140 --> 1:09:58.540]  scary time now the deputy head of the Office of Emergency Management Barry
[1:09:58.540 --> 1:10:02.940]  Jennings came out with one of the other government heads that day and said man
[1:10:02.940 --> 1:10:07.180]  there were bombs dead people building seven was blowing up this is before it
[1:10:07.180 --> 1:10:10.940]  even fell and then we went and interviewed him and then he got scared he
[1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:15.100]  got threatened the spooks found out we talked to him he said please I know you
[1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:17.820]  I said you could use it but don't then I guess they got to him and said you
[1:10:17.820 --> 1:10:22.300]  better talk to the BBC he did and he says stuff like well I think there were
[1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:26.780]  it looked like bodies I I guess it might not have been I well I don't know why
[1:10:26.780 --> 1:10:30.060]  there were bombs explosives going off I so they're gonna try to spin that and
[1:10:30.060 --> 1:10:33.580]  they're gonna try to make excuses because I've debated the producer of it on
[1:10:33.580 --> 1:10:36.740]  another show a few months ago about well we all knew building some was coming
[1:10:36.740 --> 1:10:41.100]  down that's why we reported it fell with a right behind us ignoring the cops and
[1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:43.620]  get back to bringing it down they're gonna blow it up I mean ignoring all
[1:10:43.620 --> 1:10:47.260]  this we've got them folks people always say something this big they'd be caught
[1:10:47.260 --> 1:10:50.780]  we're gonna go to Mark Dyson a moment but the point is everybody can feel it
[1:10:50.780 --> 1:10:58.420]  you can see it I mean we had so many people going public so many people
[1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:02.300]  speaking out German defense ministers high-level members of the British
[1:11:02.300 --> 1:11:06.940]  parliament members of Blair's government UN human rights chiefs over whole in
[1:11:06.940 --> 1:11:13.260]  you know investigative arms we've got former Italian presidents a former
[1:11:13.260 --> 1:11:18.380]  intelligence chiefs of Germany to all of this Hollywood stars best actress
[1:11:18.380 --> 1:11:25.140]  Willie Nelson Charlie Sheen Martin Sheen all these big rock stars have been
[1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:30.620]  going public I mean it's getting every day now you can't even keep track of
[1:11:30.620 --> 1:11:33.380]  everybody going public and so they're getting scared and going look we'll kill
[1:11:33.380 --> 1:11:38.500]  you and now I've been sent a lot of YouTube videos and things and you'll go
[1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:42.060]  to their websites there'll be Marines or Army usually force recon or special
[1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:45.340]  ops you'll go have their handle in most of its videos of them in training and
[1:11:45.340 --> 1:11:53.580]  it'll be them saying stop now or we you know or or we're gonna kill your animals
[1:11:53.580 --> 1:11:57.140]  I don't want to even give them attention or they'll use a South Park clip
[1:11:57.140 --> 1:12:00.540]  saying we're gonna kill a bunny you know on the bus you know do what I say I'm
[1:12:00.540 --> 1:12:03.420]  gonna kill the bunny stop now you're dead we're now getting all these videos and
[1:12:03.420 --> 1:12:06.500]  clips they use from movies about one more time and you're dead and they're
[1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:10.100]  sending it to 9-11 truthers and then or they'll sound they're on their own
[1:12:10.100 --> 1:12:13.580]  message board yeah I'm in the Marines and I can't wait to line you up and
[1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:17.340]  shoot you all in the head and then you go and they're really in Iraq saying this
[1:12:17.340 --> 1:12:21.060]  to us and so they're getting scared folks well they know we're interfacing with
[1:12:21.060 --> 1:12:23.900]  the military they know we're interfacing with the police that they know we're
[1:12:23.900 --> 1:12:27.900]  waking the majority of them up the new order needs these people to take over
[1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.460]  they're getting real scared so they're trying to intimidate us and I got news
[1:12:31.460 --> 1:12:37.020]  man we're all committed I mean I don't want to die but at the same time I'm
[1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:41.020]  committed and if they they're forced to kill me that means I'm really getting to
[1:12:41.020 --> 1:12:46.300]  I mean that means that that that that we're really winning and that is a
[1:12:46.300 --> 1:12:49.340]  desperate act first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they attack you
[1:12:49.340 --> 1:12:54.780]  then you win as Gandhi said so just in closing Jason this is huge this is an
[1:12:54.780 --> 1:12:58.860]  a cop or a firefighter on the street or some EMT we've interviewed who's
[1:12:58.860 --> 1:13:01.980]  credible who people ignore who said I heard the countdown you watch footage
[1:13:01.980 --> 1:13:04.940]  the cops going get get back it's about to come down they're about to blow it up
[1:13:04.940 --> 1:13:08.660]  or firefighters all you know firefighting captain going yeah there was
[1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:12.900]  molten metal you know running down the channel rails totally molten and they
[1:13:12.900 --> 1:13:16.380]  say we're lying there's no molten steel when NASA's own aircraft show the
[1:13:16.380 --> 1:13:21.580]  molten steel thousands of degrees above jet fuel the debunking isn't working
[1:13:21.580 --> 1:13:26.460]  don't you understand it's over for you terrorist and I know your military
[1:13:26.460 --> 1:13:30.140]  mindset was well we got to fight the Muslims they're so evil we killed 3,000
[1:13:30.140 --> 1:13:33.300]  because Americans are wimps and had to get a wake-up call it's for your own
[1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:37.580]  good and if we have to kill more of you for your own good we will that's the
[1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:42.220]  ultimate rationale don't don't you have have the feeling we've got the momentum
[1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:46.100]  don't you and your gut know we're gonna bring you to justice I mean aren't you
[1:13:46.100 --> 1:13:50.380]  figuring that out yet that we're not gonna stop and you can kill us threaten
[1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:54.660]  us I mean you think threatening my children
[1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:59.020]  literally folks I was getting burned out I was getting exhausted I was getting
[1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:02.100]  tired I was getting to where you guys somewhere in the office is you know just
[1:14:02.100 --> 1:14:05.420]  fighting to be able to continue staying focused I had so much going on in my
[1:14:05.420 --> 1:14:09.020]  mind and so much I want to do and so much frustration and so much little my
[1:14:09.020 --> 1:14:12.460]  new show I've got to deal with and threaten my family it's like boom I
[1:14:12.460 --> 1:14:17.140]  suddenly don't have to sleep I suddenly am just well back in total mode you guys
[1:14:17.140 --> 1:14:20.500]  have helped me I already knew you did it already knew your murderers and drug
[1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:24.940]  dealers and criminals and child sex slave traffickers and tall admitted mainstream
[1:14:24.940 --> 1:14:29.260]  news but to have you personally threatening me over and over again and
[1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:33.340]  threatening others it lets me know that you really are who we say you are you
[1:14:33.340 --> 1:14:36.940]  really are terrorist Burma say anything else you want to add I just want people
[1:14:36.940 --> 1:14:39.980]  to get this story out it is very important that we have somebody who can
[1:14:39.980 --> 1:14:44.820]  have his story corroborated from video of that day and there is no doubt that he
[1:14:44.820 --> 1:14:49.420]  was in building seven experiencing these explosions it can totally take down the
[1:14:49.420 --> 1:14:52.860]  official version and if he comes out and recants all this why would he tell a
[1:14:52.860 --> 1:14:56.660]  newscast and the guy he says he was with tell the same story separately from each
[1:14:56.660 --> 1:15:01.540]  other why would he then five and a half years later tell you that to then six
[1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:05.460]  years six and a half years later tell another story to the BBC as he's being
[1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:08.700]  promoted up the ranks absolutely and why wouldn't Michael has returned my calls
[1:15:08.700 --> 1:15:12.620]  or faxes or emails I tried to get Michael has before I even knew who Barry
[1:15:12.620 --> 1:15:16.780]  Jennings was because I had his name from the news station but of course Michael
[1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:19.220]  has didn't want to go on anything else you want to have before we go to know
[1:15:19.220 --> 1:15:22.540]  that's all that's all I would say thank you very much I want to repeat it's so
[1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:25.940]  important that people grab this video we're gonna upload at the next hour the
[1:15:25.940 --> 1:15:29.460]  present planet dot TV we don't have the personnel we need your help get it cut
[1:15:29.460 --> 1:15:32.900]  out the best pieces the last 30 minutes with me and Burma's you know don't count
[1:15:32.900 --> 1:15:36.140]  on one gotta do it do different versions I love how listeners do that send them to
[1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:39.500]  us we'll post them we'll magnify them our listeners will get them out later
[1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:43.180]  Aaron was here till five in the morning with Burma's he's asleep he's gonna come
[1:15:43.180 --> 1:15:47.020]  in try to edit some of this video we've just shot here live into the Barry
[1:15:47.020 --> 1:15:50.180]  Jennings piece to really let you know how important it is there's a video up
[1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:52.940]  there right now where Burma's gives the basic facts and then plays it it's
[1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:56.580]  decent it's just I really want to explain why this is so important people
[1:15:56.580 --> 1:16:00.860]  won't know how important this is unless we explain all those facts see Burma's
[1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:04.780]  we get too close to it we're so inside the game and all the names and the facts
[1:16:04.780 --> 1:16:08.340]  and the data we forget that even you know kind of passive 9-11 truth there's
[1:16:08.340 --> 1:16:11.980]  there's a lot of this is Greek to them I mean just a few months ago we couldn't
[1:16:11.980 --> 1:16:15.100]  say who Barry Jennings was and the debunkers were saying we were lying it
[1:16:15.100 --> 1:16:18.580]  didn't exist yeah and I can't believe the BBC thinks going to him and trying to
[1:16:18.580 --> 1:16:22.900]  twist what he says and when I've been told is he repeats the same thing he just
[1:16:22.900 --> 1:16:25.540]  kind of says well it looked like bodies well I thought it was bodies well I
[1:16:25.540 --> 1:16:29.180]  thought it was explosions well they did tell me to get out but that's because we
[1:16:29.180 --> 1:16:31.860]  knew seven I guess was gonna come down you know well why did you know that see
[1:16:31.860 --> 1:16:36.700]  but but but I mean let's be clear we went to break you forgot to say you told
[1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:39.940]  me privately in other discussions off camera he's like oh hell yeah I mean how
[1:16:39.940 --> 1:16:44.300]  far did he go singing extremely far he didn't even know who we were we don't
[1:16:44.300 --> 1:16:47.700]  tell people who we are when we go to interview them we say look we're
[1:16:47.700 --> 1:16:50.940]  interviewing for a new documentary would you like to be a part of it and he
[1:16:50.940 --> 1:16:53.740]  said that and while we were sitting there he said you know I was in one of
[1:16:53.740 --> 1:16:57.580]  these documentaries and kind of playing you know Koi knowing he was in ours I
[1:16:57.580 --> 1:17:01.780]  said oh really which one he said the Michael Myers one I go Michael Moore
[1:17:01.780 --> 1:17:05.700]  Fahrenheit 9-11 he's like no no no no no it's like the conspiracy one and I go
[1:17:05.700 --> 1:17:09.980]  loose change he's like yeah I love that movie he had a copy in the office he had
[1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:13.700]  been showing other co-workers and it was at that point that Dylan and I said yeah
[1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:17.220]  that's our film and we're making a new one right now and he was like oh that
[1:17:17.220 --> 1:17:21.220]  was you guys that's that's a great movie and I play it here all the time and then
[1:17:21.220 --> 1:17:25.260]  he started pulling in other workers to introduce them to us all right this is
[1:17:25.260 --> 1:17:29.300]  key info let's be clear so you'd say he was a 9-11 truth absolutely he knew
[1:17:29.300 --> 1:17:32.020]  exactly what and the other co-workers were coming and going this is the guy
[1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:37.540]  yeah he was like he was like these are the guys that did loose change and
[1:17:37.540 --> 1:17:40.540]  everybody it seemed in the office had seen it not everybody agreed with us
[1:17:40.540 --> 1:17:45.060]  but everybody who came in shook our hands for sure now let's be clear the
[1:17:45.060 --> 1:17:48.300]  guys that were running the emergency command bunker he's now the head of
[1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:53.580]  time I would say that I can't say which division he was in but he's the head of
[1:17:53.580 --> 1:17:57.260]  a division yeah yes and the Office of Emergency Management is really a hub
[1:17:57.260 --> 1:18:00.180]  for all these different borough divisions and he was one of those yeah
[1:18:00.180 --> 1:18:03.420]  exactly he was a chief one of the chiefs he was the head of the floor for sure
[1:18:03.420 --> 1:18:07.500]  for sure so you know he had his own little TV and DVD player in the office
[1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:12.100]  and he was sharing 9-11 truth with his co-workers but then after he got the
[1:18:12.100 --> 1:18:18.700]  heat just when it leaked that that this went on now he's trying to well from
[1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:20.900]  what I've been told he's not even completely backing away no he's not
[1:18:20.900 --> 1:18:25.420]  backing away he's a year closer to retirement when we talked to him he was
[1:18:25.420 --> 1:18:28.500]  two years away from retirement I really feel like he wanted to make sure he had
[1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:32.820]  his pension for his kids he was a family man and he was very very worried we
[1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:35.980]  literally sat in his office for two hours to get the okay that we could do
[1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:39.620]  this interview so that's why we have never said exactly where he worked or
[1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:44.380]  for what department because he then after this after we leaked this they were
[1:18:44.380 --> 1:18:47.700]  threatening to fire him and take away his pension and that would be the last
[1:18:47.700 --> 1:18:50.820]  thing I would like to do but we're not gonna let them do that no and the point
[1:18:50.820 --> 1:18:54.780]  is he did the BBC so we're forced to do this because again I want to repeat the
[1:18:54.780 --> 1:18:57.780]  key and we're gonna go to Mark Dice here I'm gonna repeat the key to all of this
[1:18:57.780 --> 1:19:03.380]  that is that Dylan's sitting there with the BBC the same guy Smith guy that
[1:19:03.380 --> 1:19:06.220]  laughs at me and you know basically admitted to me you know it's a hit piece
[1:19:06.220 --> 1:19:10.220]  in private so he thinks I'm nuts who said it wasn't a hit piece up front kind
[1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:14.980]  of disingenuously this same guy went and said well it's a lie Barry Jennings
[1:19:14.980 --> 1:19:18.900]  didn't say that it's not true you don't have video and Dylan pulls the video out
[1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:22.100]  and I bet my bottom dollar that is not gonna be in the no I guarantee that's
[1:19:22.100 --> 1:19:24.420]  not gonna be in the film and that's another reason why we had to put this
[1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:28.020]  stuff out yeah they're probably they may pull it now and delay it like they did
[1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:30.980]  the history channel piece we made them delay that release two by two weeks
[1:19:30.980 --> 1:19:34.020]  because they went and pulled stuff out because we expose them so we're
[1:19:34.020 --> 1:19:40.580]  preemptively countering the BBC the you know propaganda ministry of truth right
[1:19:40.580 --> 1:19:43.580]  now absolutely and that's a another reason to put it out it was gonna be in
[1:19:43.580 --> 1:19:47.640]  fabled enemies anyway but why not put it out two weeks before their hit piece to
[1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:50.900]  show what liars and hypocrites they are absolutely let's go to Mark Dice and
[1:19:50.900 --> 1:19:53.660]  we'll hold him over to the next segment the next segment after that and then I
[1:19:53.660 --> 1:19:57.420]  got some financial news coming up and a lot more Mark Dice what do you think of

[1:25:19.580 --> 1:25:23.900]  now here's the deal it's clearly fair use mark's commenting on it
[1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:27.580]  they took down a bunch of our videos they took down dozens of other videos we
[1:25:27.580 --> 1:25:31.980]  know of where we'd play a short clip and comment on it
[1:25:31.980 --> 1:25:35.980]  they even took down videos that were criticizing mark dice
[1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:39.500]  i mean that were criticizing michael reagan that didn't even have michael
[1:25:39.500 --> 1:25:42.060]  reagan on it they've been pulling clips of him saying put
[1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:46.780]  hang grenades and babies rectums and murder them kill the muslim babies
[1:25:46.780 --> 1:25:50.380]  uh i mean they are something else and
[1:25:50.380 --> 1:25:55.580]  is your youtube account still shut down uh mark dice
[1:25:55.580 --> 1:25:59.980]  the entire youtube account is shut down all videos have been pulled i filed a
[1:25:59.980 --> 1:26:04.220]  counter you have millions of views on your videos
[1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:08.860]  yeah 60 over 60 videos a three-year-old account almost
[1:26:08.860 --> 1:26:14.140]  and just numerous links hundreds of links to those videos in the entire
[1:26:14.140 --> 1:26:18.380]  the entire account has been closed i filed a counter suit with youtube trying
[1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:22.460]  to get it back up trying to uh to understand make them understand that
[1:26:22.460 --> 1:26:27.980]  this is just a a fair use claim that this you mean counter suit or a or a
[1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:31.900]  uh counter claim rather to attempt to reinstate the
[1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:35.820]  account so that's in the works right now i i just got
[1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:40.540]  word to that michael reagan is uh officially above the law the
[1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:44.460]  the u.s attorney's office will not be pressing charges
[1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:50.060]  against him for for his comments and any any other future
[1:26:50.060 --> 1:26:54.300]  uh threats against me by his listeners or by anybody else will then be
[1:26:54.300 --> 1:26:58.300]  investigated those people individually but michael reagan himself
[1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:02.220]  has officially been let off the hook and still has a job now this sets a
[1:27:02.220 --> 1:27:05.740]  precedent but don't believe that for a minute if i go on air
[1:27:05.740 --> 1:27:09.740]  and even say hypothetically and i'm not saying do this hypothetically if i said
[1:27:09.740 --> 1:27:12.300]  go kill michael reagan i'll pay for the bullets
[1:27:12.300 --> 1:27:15.660]  hell the cops may edit that and come arrest me right now uh i would go to
[1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:18.460]  prison immediately probably kill me in the swat team right they use any
[1:27:18.460 --> 1:27:22.860]  excuse to come kill you nowadays that's how that but his listeners would then
[1:27:22.860 --> 1:27:25.900]  call for violence against you and for others and it just goes to show the
[1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:29.580]  state of our hearts the state of the the heart and the mind of this movement
[1:27:29.580 --> 1:27:33.580]  because nobody is is calling for equal action against him
[1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:37.420]  uh nobody contrary we don't want any violence against him
[1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:41.100]  until we take the republic back and then they all get due process
[1:27:41.100 --> 1:27:43.820]  we know into the white house got propaganda points
[1:27:43.820 --> 1:27:46.780]  that's illegal we know he's on their payroll then
[1:27:46.780 --> 1:27:51.020]  he will be brought to justice in a nurenberg style trial
[1:27:51.020 --> 1:27:55.340]  it's interesting the president of his uh radio syndicator radio america's
[1:27:55.340 --> 1:27:58.620]  name is jim roberts he's also the president of the american veteran
[1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:03.340]  center and the american veteran center and radio america's headquarters is

[1:33:52.380 --> 1:33:55.740]  a great job of that michael reagan interview
[1:33:55.740 --> 1:33:58.620]  it sounded to me from the youtube clip like they'd edited some of your
[1:33:58.620 --> 1:34:01.980]  interview uh that you did with him in a taped interview
[1:34:01.980 --> 1:34:05.820]  but they did error that thank god and you did a great job there
[1:34:05.820 --> 1:34:09.100]  we need to see operation inform the troops intensify you've got the floor
[1:34:09.100 --> 1:34:12.700]  mark dice yeah it was interesting they they did edit
[1:34:12.700 --> 1:34:16.140]  out one part where i informed his listeners that it was a pre-recorded
[1:34:16.140 --> 1:34:19.420]  show that was 8 30 in the morning my time and i wanted everybody to know
[1:34:19.420 --> 1:34:22.860]  those the pre-recorded show i took precautions to ensure that they wouldn't
[1:34:22.860 --> 1:34:27.420]  edit out any important information uh also yeah i don't want this to to
[1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:31.020]  overshadow operation inform the soldiers another aspect what we can do is
[1:34:31.020 --> 1:34:34.380]  send them a cd's of the alex jones show and
[1:34:34.380 --> 1:34:39.260]  in other shows other broadcasts send them cds on mp3 or even
[1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:43.420]  burn a cd as a wave file so they can listen to it in their disc man
[1:34:43.420 --> 1:34:47.900]  or give them uh some flash drives with some mp3 yeah some drives are great
[1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:52.460]  some drives are great they can put it on their mp3 player their ipod and
[1:34:52.460 --> 1:34:56.140]  listen to it also you mark them mark them mark them family
[1:34:56.140 --> 1:35:00.780]  videos or stuff like that yeah pictures from home photos from home
[1:35:00.780 --> 1:35:04.380]  something like that again uh they're they're trying to make sure that no
[1:35:04.380 --> 1:35:07.820]  uh no material is going to reach the troops but don't think that'll stop us
[1:35:07.820 --> 1:35:11.740]  we need to hit the bases and everywhere wherever we live
[1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:15.820]  we need to go in and get the info in there yeah another aspect not only just
[1:35:15.820 --> 1:35:19.500]  sending it overseas but here at the at camp pennilton california other
[1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:23.260]  military bases around the country to the soldiers before they even go over
[1:35:23.260 --> 1:35:26.540]  there so that they can spread the word amongst their own groups and amongst
[1:35:26.540 --> 1:35:30.060]  their their peers and their their commanding officers over here so that
[1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:33.020]  they know uh what's going on and that once the higher
[1:35:33.020 --> 1:35:36.460]  ups know that everybody knows their whole systems is going to come collapsing
[1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:38.460]  down that's right and we got the one of the
[1:35:38.460 --> 1:35:42.140]  deputy heads of emergency management coming out saying inside job
[1:35:42.140 --> 1:35:45.340]  and uh that's for the first time ever berm is telling you about him in private
[1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:48.380]  i'd already been told the story a year ago and can never
[1:35:48.380 --> 1:35:52.380]  tell it on air had to be called a liar and say none of it existed well there you
[1:35:52.380 --> 1:35:58.140]  go there it is for everybody else mark i mean their whole thing is imploding
[1:35:58.140 --> 1:36:01.900]  it's coming down and i mean every day now more and more people are waking up
[1:36:01.900 --> 1:36:05.340]  and so there was a time when i i felt like there was a lull in 9-11
[1:36:05.340 --> 1:36:07.820]  truth i myself was starting to doubt whether we're going to get this
[1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:11.020]  information out whether even anybody in the mainstream media was going to
[1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:15.500]  cover these issues and just when i start losing faith something happens another
[1:36:15.500 --> 1:36:18.620]  big prominent official another expert comes forward another
[1:36:18.620 --> 1:36:22.380]  instance another confrontation for from one of these criminals on the streets
[1:36:22.380 --> 1:36:25.420]  sort of book signing happens as posted to the web makes it to the news
[1:36:25.420 --> 1:36:28.780]  well that's why this is key if we weren't on the offensive they would have
[1:36:28.780 --> 1:36:31.740]  already staged more attacks we'd already be in iran
[1:36:31.740 --> 1:36:35.340]  and so this we're trying to save lives they if they can intimidate us
[1:36:35.340 --> 1:36:38.940]  and use staged terror events to get the public to buy the end of the fourth
[1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:41.580]  amendment the end of the fifth the end of the second the end of the first
[1:36:41.580 --> 1:36:44.460]  which they're attacking all wholesale and dismantling
[1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:47.740]  if they're able to sell all this they would have been able to get away with
[1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:51.100]  it but now everybody knows they're torturing murdering drug dealing
[1:36:51.100 --> 1:36:55.580]  killers everybody knows they killed kennedy the shadow government is now
[1:36:55.580 --> 1:36:58.780]  being exposed and they are in and now it gives
[1:36:58.780 --> 1:37:03.020]  protection to good men and women in the cia good people in the fbi
[1:37:03.020 --> 1:37:06.540]  good people in the military to more and more say no
[1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:09.740]  to more and more talk about all the army investigators they've murdered
[1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:13.260]  general to goomba the head army uh brigadier general just
[1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:16.540]  who retired came out and said yeah the government tortures kids it's murder
[1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:19.820]  it's war crimes the cover-ups got to be exposed
[1:37:19.820 --> 1:37:23.100]  and it's literally because they like torturing children
[1:37:23.100 --> 1:37:26.620]  and they also like setting the precedent that if they can be the good guys and
[1:37:26.620 --> 1:37:31.340]  torture children uh in the ways that you know that uh you
[1:37:31.340 --> 1:37:34.460]  notice how reagan said the same time of things that are in the in the
[1:37:34.460 --> 1:37:39.180]  white house orders you see i mean imagine putting orders out saying
[1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:43.660]  sodomize little kids i mean these people i have to argue with people and say
[1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:48.300]  that's wrong mark dice yeah it's just completely immoral i'm

[1:40:14.940 --> 1:40:17.820]  that there's about a 70 depending on which guy you talk to but it's about a
[1:40:17.820 --> 1:40:23.660]  70 some say 50 some say 90 but on average about a 70 chance
[1:40:23.660 --> 1:40:28.700]  total meltdown depression within two and a half to three years
[1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:36.780]  but if gold starts rocketing up to five thousand if oil which is at

[1:41:06.220 --> 1:41:10.460]  government could have reversed it instead they're accelerating
[1:41:10.460 --> 1:41:14.700]  the policies that they admit will do this in their own think tank documents
[1:41:14.700 --> 1:41:17.820]  and if i could get you to wake up to that we could put political pressure on
[1:41:17.820 --> 1:41:23.100]  but it's too important to you to keep acting like there's all these ego maniacs
[1:41:23.100 --> 1:41:26.700]  the most men in this country and women are so into themselves and so into how
[1:41:26.700 --> 1:41:31.580]  they look and so into thinking they're on top of things that everything's fine

[1:47:34.460 --> 1:47:37.900]  as inflation psychology becomes more and more embedded
[1:47:37.900 --> 1:47:41.020]  and people become desperate to have a source of value

[1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:14.380]  value it's going to lose 90 percent of its remaining
[1:48:14.380 --> 1:48:18.300]  value at current inflation trends in two and a
[1:48:18.300 --> 1:48:22.460]  half years that's why they say total depression two and a half years a hyper

[1:48:33.420 --> 1:48:36.140]  going man this train is going 150 miles an hour
[1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:40.460]  and around that next bend is a cliff and we're going to go off the edge of it
[1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:43.820]  help me pull the lever down help me politically
[1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:47.340]  expose that this is being engineered to collapse the economy so they can buy up
[1:48:47.340 --> 1:48:50.540]  what's left and you just go we're not on a train
[1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:54.940]  and just drill and i'm going look out the wind as we are in a train this is

[1:49:14.220 --> 1:49:18.700]  an ounce why are they saying that not me
[1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:22.300]  conservatively they're talking about 2500 an ounce in the next year
[1:49:22.300 --> 1:49:26.780]  why are they saying that because they've dumped hundreds of billions of gold
[1:49:26.780 --> 1:49:29.340]  the last year the imf and world bank have been
[1:49:29.340 --> 1:49:32.620]  holding on the market and it hasn't been able to keep the price down
[1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:37.100]  and the price always goes down in the summer and then it always goes back up
[1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:40.700]  but it's always a new plateau you know 2004
[1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:47.740]  winter summer 2005 winter summer see it's always going up 2005
[1:49:47.740 --> 1:49:53.180]  winter summer 2006 winter goes down almost 2007
[1:49:53.180 --> 1:49:57.980]  goes up in the winter but down the summer but doesn't lose all its gains
[1:49:57.980 --> 1:50:04.700]  and then now 2008 goes up in the you know from 2007 out of the winter into the
[1:50:04.700 --> 1:50:07.820]  into the spring and then goes down a little bit and then man it's going to
[1:50:07.820 --> 1:50:13.740]  race back up now is the buying opportunity the other yuppies aren't
[1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:16.540]  going to listen they're know-it-alls their egos tell them they're powerful and
[1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:19.100]  run everything they think they're members of the elite because they got a golf

[1:50:37.180 --> 1:50:41.340]  bloomberg knows what's going on uh the united states is trying to bail its way

[1:50:46.460 --> 1:50:51.020]  uh yes indeed the uh the imf is trying to keep the prices of gold low
[1:50:51.020 --> 1:50:55.500]  keep people back into the into the paper currency but we do have inflation
[1:50:55.500 --> 1:50:58.620]  it's coming at us like you said like a runaway train
[1:50:58.620 --> 1:51:01.820]  and that's why every other commodity skyrocketing and they're not going to be
[1:51:01.820 --> 1:51:05.500]  able to suppress gold long no because gold will go along up go up with grain

[1:55:20.060 --> 1:55:23.180]  and gold in the past he always has great deals for listeners
[1:55:23.180 --> 1:55:26.300]  i was getting into financial news today and i thought why not get Ted on he
[1:55:26.300 --> 1:55:30.060]  hadn't been on in a few months uh gold has been up and down between you know
[1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:33.420]  eight and eight ninety and nine hundred and twenty five dollars in the last
[1:55:33.420 --> 1:55:37.100]  month uh it always does that in the summer wherever it said it goes up and
[1:55:37.100 --> 1:55:40.540]  down for the summer this is a major buying i mean if i had any
[1:55:40.540 --> 1:55:43.660]  extra money uh or had the time to look at the coins
[1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:49.020]  Ted's got i would buy a few coins now i mean this is the time to move into
[1:55:49.020 --> 1:55:53.100]  metals this is the time because you may think nine hundred
[1:55:53.100 --> 1:55:56.780]  bucks an ounce is a lot ladies and gentlemen they're talking
[1:55:56.780 --> 1:56:02.540]  Bloomberg financial and others about five thousand dollars an ounce okay
[1:56:02.540 --> 1:56:06.300]  gold was only 280 something dollars five years ago
[1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:11.100]  an ounce and it's nine hundred and something Ted um
[1:56:11.100 --> 1:56:14.780]  i'm not happy when i hear news about five thousand dollar
[1:56:14.780 --> 1:56:19.500]  coins uh i mean that tells me when the establishment starts talking about
[1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:23.900]  that five thousand dollar an ounce uh gold
[1:56:23.900 --> 1:56:27.180]  that tells me that they they understand that they're not going to be able to
[1:56:27.180 --> 1:56:29.500]  suppress gold no they're not going to be able to
[1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:32.620]  suppress gold not when you take a look at what they're doing to the currency
[1:56:32.620 --> 1:56:37.020]  you're trying to do a ratio here how many paper dollars does it take to buy
[1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:41.500]  one ounce of gold right now the uh the the government's doing everything they
[1:56:41.500 --> 1:56:44.620]  can to print money and get it out of the system to save
[1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:48.140]  it's like they're trying to they're trying to save a sinking ship by
[1:56:48.140 --> 1:56:52.060]  by drilling new holes on the floor you know it it doesn't make sense but that's
[1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:56.140]  the way it is i mean we are watching the dollar melt away
[1:56:56.140 --> 1:57:00.060]  as we sit here and talk the value of the currency is depreciating
[1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:03.340]  like you said people from other countries are getting out of the dollar
[1:57:03.340 --> 1:57:06.140]  even people in the united states are getting out of the dollar
[1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:10.300]  and right now we're sitting at gold right now it it's at eight eighty three
[1:57:10.300 --> 1:57:13.180]  ninety it's been as high today as nine oh three
[1:57:13.180 --> 1:57:16.860]  and uh and if you wait if you wait until september
[1:57:16.860 --> 1:57:21.420]  or even august to buy gold if it behaves anything like it has been for the last
[1:57:21.420 --> 1:57:24.940]  30 years you'll be paying at least 40 percent more
[1:57:24.940 --> 1:57:29.260]  for the gold you have to get that's key and listeners you always buy when it's
[1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:33.500]  up i have no idea why even i catch myself doing that
[1:57:33.500 --> 1:57:37.100]  you need to buy when it is resting it's resting
[1:57:37.100 --> 1:57:41.980]  at a very nice place a hundred dollars below what it was a few months ago
[1:57:41.980 --> 1:57:45.340]  but hundreds and hundreds of dollars above what it was a year ago
[1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:49.260]  and i'm telling you the graph go look at a 20 year 30 year gold graph a five year
[1:57:49.260 --> 1:57:52.700]  graph it always goes up in the fall and
[1:57:52.700 --> 1:57:55.820]  winter and down in the spring and summer but it
[1:57:55.820 --> 1:57:59.900]  never when it's going up goes down further than it went in the gains
[1:57:59.900 --> 1:58:04.540]  you always end up keeping about half the gains it's the same thing with oil
[1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:08.220]  okay so as i said oil's going to go down but but it's opposite oil goes up in
[1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:11.180]  the summer gold goes up in the winter but but if you take
[1:58:11.180 --> 1:58:15.740]  the two graphs it's the same seesaw but it but if you look at gold if you look
[1:58:15.740 --> 1:58:18.620]  at silver if you look at other commodities they're all
[1:58:18.620 --> 1:58:22.700]  on a multi-year graph going straight up yeah that's right alex and right now
[1:58:22.700 --> 1:58:25.740]  we better talk about it real quick here because i've got some things that are
[1:58:25.740 --> 1:58:29.740]  sizzling hot right now that you can get into that there's no way that this fall
[1:58:29.740 --> 1:58:32.300]  you're going to be able to buy it at these prices anymore

[2:01:42.700 --> 2:01:47.500]  this just now came out uh in associated press
[2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:51.900]  right now up on info awards dot com it's also up on drudge and yahu news
[2:01:51.900 --> 2:01:56.300]  oil rises on modest saudi increase nigeria
[2:01:56.300 --> 2:02:01.100]  oil prices have risen amid disappointment with saudi's output hike
[2:02:01.100 --> 2:02:05.020]  and uh it goes on and they give you the disinfo saying it's nigerian pipeline
[2:02:05.020 --> 2:02:09.500]  problems uh it's it's dollar it's i i watched yesterday
[2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:13.100]  the saudi uh oil emergency meeting and they kept
[2:02:13.100 --> 2:02:16.620]  saying it's currency it's currency but you'll never get on our news
[2:02:16.620 --> 2:02:19.820]  because they can't tell the people the truth because this is being done by
[2:02:19.820 --> 2:02:23.260]  design and the public would get mad if they found out their criminal
[2:02:23.260 --> 2:02:27.420]  government did this ted certainly get away from the us dollar that's for sure
[2:02:27.420 --> 2:02:30.700]  and that's what people should be doing at this time that when i talk about the
[2:02:30.700 --> 2:02:34.460]  us dollar i'm not talking about our constitutional currency that we
[2:02:34.460 --> 2:02:37.340]  should have here in the united states of america private
[2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:40.620]  federal reserve yeah there's a private federal reserve it has nothing to do with
[2:02:40.620 --> 2:02:44.540]  the united states government or representation of u.s citizens
[2:02:44.540 --> 2:02:48.140]  it has only to do with a private banky car and we always told people it was
[2:02:48.140 --> 2:02:51.020]  dangerous to give them this power and they they are engineering a mass
[2:02:51.020 --> 2:02:54.620]  riping ted give them the golden silver offer for the day again
[2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:58.140]  right now i've got uh walking liberty rolls if you pick them up right now
[2:02:58.140 --> 2:03:01.900]  they're at 182 if you if you look at it if you buy and buy the
[2:03:01.900 --> 2:03:05.020]  coin it's 180 a per roll but you get a discount on that
[2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:09.020]  i also have the british sovereign coin it's a great coin to get into small
[2:03:09.020 --> 2:03:14.460]  piece of gold they're at 243 per coin you really do need to get
[2:03:14.460 --> 2:03:18.780]  into small gold and you need to have uh small fractions of silver
[2:03:18.780 --> 2:03:22.780]  and right now i also have the frank coin which we've talked a lot about two
[2:03:22.780 --> 2:03:27.180]  alex and they're right now at 194 and we were talking about those
[2:03:27.180 --> 2:03:31.340]  back at the around january and they're sitting at about 200 and i think about
[2:03:31.340 --> 2:03:35.500]  215 at that time and uh and the reason why
[2:03:35.500 --> 2:03:39.100]  the prices are low right now is just basically a seasonal thing
[2:03:39.100 --> 2:03:43.340]  it's not low it's up at 900 compared to what it was a year ago now
[2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:47.740]  uh folks it will go up in i mean every time it has in the fall
[2:03:47.740 --> 2:03:52.860]  and they're talking about $5,000 uh an ounce it's at 900 an ounce right now

[2:04:15.100 --> 2:04:19.900]  a very serious look because the united states dollar is doomed because the
[2:04:19.900 --> 2:04:23.100]  foreigners want to get away from it and they're the ones who supported it when
[2:04:23.100 --> 2:04:27.580]  we're going folks do the right thing do the smart thing i know you're going to

[2:04:33.660 --> 2:04:36.380]  racing towards 2000 i don't know what's going to happen
[2:04:36.380 --> 2:04:39.660]  but i know the dollar's being devalued and that means gold's going to go up

[2:04:43.500 --> 2:04:47.820]  686 2237 regardless let's say it stays the same
[2:04:47.820 --> 2:04:51.740]  at least it isn't being devalued like your dollars or like everything else

[2:08:47.340 --> 2:08:51.740]  we've been having icons on the show like geobre griffin and many others but i
[2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:55.260]  really can't think of anybody when it comes to really delving deeply into the
[2:08:55.260 --> 2:08:58.780]  new world order and exposing so many dark
[2:08:58.780 --> 2:09:02.620]  secrets that we now just take as commonplace knowledge
[2:09:02.620 --> 2:09:05.900]  so much of it was pioneered and rediscovered because it was all there
[2:09:05.900 --> 2:09:09.500]  in the ancient documents and texts by jordan maxwell
[2:09:09.500 --> 2:09:13.660]  so we'll be talking to him in just one moment here we go to jordan

[2:09:26.460 --> 2:09:30.380]  ventura it's got video interview with george carlin who died last night of
[2:09:30.380 --> 2:09:34.300]  course in southern california of heart failure talking about how the
[2:09:34.300 --> 2:09:36.460]  government wouldn't have an investigation 9 11 they wouldn't
[2:09:36.460 --> 2:09:39.740]  investigate something they did they wouldn't investigate
[2:09:39.740 --> 2:09:45.260]  themselves uh it but but i mean it's got everybody martin sheen it's
[2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:49.420]  got uh the head of democracy now saying
[2:09:49.420 --> 2:09:53.100]  9 11 should be investigated building 7 should be investigated
[2:09:53.100 --> 2:09:56.460]  michael more saying it could be an inside job and the firefighters have told
[2:09:56.460 --> 2:10:01.180]  him there were bombs in the buildings but we've got to expand the description
[2:10:01.180 --> 2:10:04.460]  that's up on the info wars dot com shopping cart because it mainly gets
[2:10:04.460 --> 2:10:06.700]  into how we confront swartz and agar and
[2:10:06.700 --> 2:10:10.940]  how we confront lin shaney and how just all these people get confronted
[2:10:10.940 --> 2:10:16.780]  hundreds of people barack obama i mean the list goes on and on uh both

[2:10:21.900 --> 2:10:27.580]  with we are changed at 9 11 truth and everybody uh the video of uh of course
[2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:34.620]  we are changed la basically taking over uh bill mars show
[2:10:34.620 --> 2:10:39.340]  so it's a story of people standing up taking action having a great effect
[2:10:39.340 --> 2:10:42.700]  confronting bill clinton hillary bill clinton blowing up admitting bohemian
[2:10:42.700 --> 2:10:47.980]  grove admitting bill berg meltdowns the media saying kill us
[2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:54.060]  arrest us but woven through this is the firefighters police and military and
[2:10:54.060 --> 2:10:57.660]  emt's dying of the dust the government documents where they knew it was going
[2:10:57.660 --> 2:11:01.500]  to kill them and decided not to give them health care
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:08.620]  all of that uh is in the film and it just completely devastates

[2:12:06.460 --> 2:12:10.460]  i'm really excited about having jordan maxwell on the show
[2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:13.820]  i kind of woke up to the new order on my own
[2:12:13.820 --> 2:12:19.900]  or kind of on the john burt society route wasn't part of the john burt society
[2:12:19.900 --> 2:12:22.780]  but read stuff like nondare called a conspiracy the private
[2:12:22.780 --> 2:12:25.660]  fellow reserve and then i learned about ron paul
[2:12:25.660 --> 2:12:29.740]  15 years ago and got a radio show and was kind of a mainline conservative
[2:12:29.740 --> 2:12:32.620]  republican who was anti-new world order than i found out that that party was
[2:12:32.620 --> 2:12:39.980]  controlled i mean even as late as 1998 99
[2:12:39.980 --> 2:12:43.500]  i wouldn't get into the occult on air i wouldn't talk about it i didn't believe
[2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:46.140]  it i thought hey the fellow reserve's private they do want a world
[2:12:46.140 --> 2:12:48.780]  government for their administrative convenience
[2:12:48.780 --> 2:12:52.860]  it is bad but there's no occult and and you know that's a bunch of
[2:12:52.860 --> 2:12:56.540]  there's dumb conspiracy theorist there's no black helicopters there's no
[2:12:56.540 --> 2:13:00.300]  femacamp plans and then dealt the force invaded texas they bribed police
[2:13:00.300 --> 2:13:03.340]  chiefs i interviewed them i found out they had martial law plans with the
[2:13:03.340 --> 2:13:07.580]  san antonio police chief the emergency managers and i and then i found out
[2:13:07.580 --> 2:13:11.340]  about behemian grove and i found out it was real and i infiltrated it and so
[2:13:11.340 --> 2:13:15.420]  so really you know i am a johnny come lately
[2:13:15.420 --> 2:13:19.900]  doesn't matter we're all johnny come lately's uh you know in the short life
[2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:23.660]  we have the point is we can all move forward take action
[2:13:23.660 --> 2:13:28.060]  and then i remember chrissa thanus in about 98 99 putting jordan maxwell
[2:13:28.060 --> 2:13:32.300]  videos on local access and i remember watching those and
[2:13:32.300 --> 2:13:35.580]  looking into it and i already knew a lot of egyptian history and and and and
[2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:38.140]  other history and so i knew it was accurate because i'd already
[2:13:38.140 --> 2:13:40.700]  independently learned it but never put it into thought of
[2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:44.460]  what was happening today so he really helped wake me up to a larger world and
[2:13:44.460 --> 2:13:47.420]  larger view and jordan maxwell continues as a
[2:13:47.420 --> 2:13:51.500]  preeminent researcher an independent scholar in the field of occult religious
[2:13:51.500 --> 2:13:55.260]  philosophy his interest in these subjects began far back as 59
[2:13:55.260 --> 2:13:59.020]  he served for three and a half years as the regional editor of true seeker
[2:13:59.020 --> 2:14:02.380]  magazine america's oldest uh free thought journal since
[2:14:02.380 --> 2:14:06.460]  1873 his work exploring the hidden foundations of western religions and
[2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:10.380]  secret societies creates enthusiastic responses from audiences around the
[2:14:10.380 --> 2:14:13.980]  world he has conducted dozens of intense seminars hosted
[2:14:13.980 --> 2:14:17.820]  his own radio talk show guests on more than 600 radio shows and written
[2:14:17.820 --> 2:14:20.460]  produced and appeared in numerous television shows and documentaries
[2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:23.820]  including the two-hour special for cbs tv network as well as

[2:14:26.940 --> 2:14:30.540]  understanding ancient religions and their pervasive influence on world
[2:14:30.540 --> 2:14:33.980]  affairs today his works on the subject of secret societies both
[2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:38.620]  ancient and modern and their symbols uh has fascinated audiences around the
[2:14:38.620 --> 2:14:43.740]  world for decades considering uh the rapidly moving events of today and
[2:14:43.740 --> 2:14:47.420]  the very real part these hidden religious agendas play in our modern
[2:14:47.420 --> 2:14:50.460]  war-torn world he feels that controversial subjects are not only
[2:14:50.460 --> 2:14:53.260]  interesting to explore but too important to ignore
[2:14:53.260 --> 2:14:57.020]  his extraordinary presentations include documents and photographs seldom seen
[2:14:57.020 --> 2:15:01.260]  elsewhere now we can argue about our interpretation of what jordan says but i
[2:15:01.260 --> 2:15:04.620]  agree with the info he brings out i may even disagree with some of his
[2:15:04.620 --> 2:15:09.100]  interpretations on certain things it's very complex and nuanced but
[2:15:09.100 --> 2:15:14.220]  regardless we should all have debates about these subjects he gets into
[2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:17.820]  astro theology sexual symbolism and world religions
[2:15:17.820 --> 2:15:21.420]  foundations of modern-day religion secret societies and toxic religion

[2:15:36.620 --> 2:15:39.500]  we may even hold him over a little bit into overdrive today but i wanted to
[2:15:39.500 --> 2:15:42.860]  properly introduce him jordan doesn't like to talk about
[2:15:42.860 --> 2:15:47.100]  himself but he does have cancer he is not doing well financially
[2:15:47.100 --> 2:15:49.900]  i've heard him on a lot of shows over the years he never seems to plug his

[2:16:16.620 --> 2:16:20.940]  i uh yeah i just i can't tell you how much i appreciate
[2:16:20.940 --> 2:16:23.820]  your your support and the things you've said
[2:16:23.820 --> 2:16:29.260]  and i i thank you for it and yeah it's it's true that uh
[2:16:29.260 --> 2:16:32.620]  i was interested in these subjects as far back as
[2:16:32.620 --> 2:16:36.620]  when when i was a you know teenager and and even earlier
[2:16:36.620 --> 2:16:39.980]  when i was a kid i used to ask my parents and ask the
[2:16:39.980 --> 2:16:43.660]  adults around me questions and uh and they just
[2:16:43.660 --> 2:16:48.300]  look at me with glassy eyes and they have no idea in the world what i was
[2:16:48.300 --> 2:16:54.300]  talking about and consequently i i just never understood why people
[2:16:54.300 --> 2:16:57.580]  weren't interested in the things that i was you know
[2:16:57.580 --> 2:17:02.460]  and so at 18 years old i moved to california
[2:17:02.460 --> 2:17:08.300]  and uh by myself ended up in los angeles with nine dollars in my pocket
[2:17:08.300 --> 2:17:12.540]  no family no friends here nobody had had no idea in the world
[2:17:12.540 --> 2:17:16.060]  you know what i was going to do with my life but i ended up in LA with nine
[2:17:16.060 --> 2:17:21.500]  dollars in my pocket in downtown LA and somehow or another i lived through
[2:17:21.500 --> 2:17:24.380]  all of it and but i was fascinated with how
[2:17:24.380 --> 2:17:28.940]  much people don't know how much people don't care to know
[2:17:28.940 --> 2:17:33.180]  and i hear people then today say why don't the why doesn't the government
[2:17:33.180 --> 2:17:37.740]  tell us the truth and why doesn't these educational institutes really tell us
[2:17:37.740 --> 2:17:41.980]  the truth i think it's because they the illuminati
[2:17:41.980 --> 2:17:45.820]  know that we generally speaking don't want
[2:17:45.820 --> 2:17:48.780]  the truth we don't want to hear the truth
[2:17:48.780 --> 2:17:52.780]  oh i've had jordan elitist come up to me i mean high-level members of government
[2:17:52.780 --> 2:17:57.260]  and others and say alex and they always say this is off record right now i'm a
[2:17:57.260 --> 2:18:01.100]  journalist so it has to be off record and they say look the slaves don't want to
[2:18:01.100 --> 2:18:04.300]  know you're basically one of us you want to be enlightened
[2:18:04.300 --> 2:18:07.020]  you can't help them you might as well just take care of yourself
[2:18:07.020 --> 2:18:11.500]  well that's what i'm saying i mean i have to i i have to say that that
[2:18:11.500 --> 2:18:15.020]  is pretty much true and then i also want to ask the question
[2:18:15.020 --> 2:18:20.460]  how important is it to tell the people the real truth i mean like the movie
[2:18:20.460 --> 2:18:24.540]  with uh you know when the when the military guy
[2:18:24.540 --> 2:18:28.860]  was asked by the uh the kid you know well what do you want he said i want to
[2:18:28.860 --> 2:18:31.980]  know the truth and he said you can't handle the truth
[2:18:31.980 --> 2:18:36.460]  um how important is it to tell people the real truth
[2:18:36.460 --> 2:18:40.780]  because what you're doing uh and i've learned this the hard way what you're

[2:25:15.980 --> 2:25:19.340]  you know less than 20 bucks in your pocket in LA when you're
[2:25:19.340 --> 2:25:23.100]  13 years old go through your life your awakening
[2:25:23.100 --> 2:25:27.340]  process some of the people you ran into
[2:25:27.340 --> 2:25:31.340]  over the years and and and what that awakening was like
[2:25:31.340 --> 2:25:35.500]  well yeah i was 18 when i when i came to los angeles and i had no idea
[2:25:35.500 --> 2:25:38.540]  why i just felt i had to go somewhere
[2:25:38.540 --> 2:25:42.780]  originally i'm from the south and from florida and i ended up in los angeles
[2:25:42.780 --> 2:25:48.540]  back in 59 and uh i i had no idea why i was here
[2:25:48.540 --> 2:25:53.500]  or what i was going to do with my life but i just was was drawn to the fact
[2:25:53.500 --> 2:25:57.740]  that i wanted to know and so many people today just
[2:25:57.740 --> 2:26:02.060]  don't want to know and so uh that's what drove me and
[2:26:02.060 --> 2:26:06.860]  and i've done what i have done with nothing for so many years
[2:26:06.860 --> 2:26:11.580]  because i have always appreciated the people who made themselves available
[2:26:11.580 --> 2:26:16.460]  for me uh by doing tapes and records and
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:20.780]  lectures and teachers who i could go to to learn
[2:26:20.780 --> 2:26:24.620]  the things that i was my heart was burning to know
[2:26:24.620 --> 2:26:28.620]  and i would i would attend all the lectures i could
[2:26:28.620 --> 2:26:32.700]  read everything i could get my hands on because i wanted to know and i really
[2:26:32.700 --> 2:26:38.860]  appreciated those people many years ago that were there out on the front lines
[2:26:38.860 --> 2:26:42.620]  like you are today making the information available
[2:26:42.620 --> 2:26:47.100]  so that i could learn and so that's what i wanted to do with my life
[2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:52.380]  at 19 years old is to gather up as much information as possible and
[2:26:52.380 --> 2:26:57.500]  and make it available to all that wanted to hear and so i was very idealistic
[2:26:57.500 --> 2:27:01.180]  about that but i discovered something
[2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:04.860]  i'll tell you a big secret that i discovered that took me many years to
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:09.180]  figure it out but uh people will always
[2:27:09.180 --> 2:27:12.780]  support what they want to hear they will not
[2:27:12.780 --> 2:27:16.540]  support what they don't want to hear and if you like country music you're not
[2:27:16.540 --> 2:27:20.460]  going to pay money for an opera if you like classical music you're not going
[2:27:20.460 --> 2:27:24.220]  to pay money uh to go to an acid rock concert so people will
[2:27:24.220 --> 2:27:29.340]  always support what they want to hear and so i always assumed as a young
[2:27:29.340 --> 2:27:33.500]  person that people were like me they wanted to know the truth
[2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:37.580]  and so i later on discovered that uh no most
[2:27:37.580 --> 2:27:42.860]  most of the time people do not want to know the truth
[2:27:42.860 --> 2:27:46.060]  they will look at something see that it's wrong
[2:27:46.060 --> 2:27:49.980]  and then prefer to uh as churchill said uh they'll
[2:27:49.980 --> 2:27:53.820]  every now and then you'll stumble on the truth but then you'll pick yourself up
[2:27:53.820 --> 2:27:57.020]  brush yourself off and go on act like you never saw it
[2:27:57.020 --> 2:28:00.940]  and just go on to live your life and go to the ball game and have a good time
[2:28:00.940 --> 2:28:05.980]  and one day what comes around goes around one day
[2:28:05.980 --> 2:28:10.060]  what you should have looked at you should have been concerned about
[2:28:10.060 --> 2:28:14.380]  well when it comes to you finally and you finally have to see
[2:28:14.380 --> 2:28:17.660]  what you you know what you could have seen years ago
[2:28:17.660 --> 2:28:22.220]  but you didn't want to well that's what i wanted to do is to make this kind of
[2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:26.780]  information uh that i was interested in available to everyone
[2:28:26.780 --> 2:28:31.340]  and uh you mentioned john bert society as far back as 19
[2:28:31.340 --> 2:28:38.380]  i think they were found at 1959 in bellmark massachusetts well i used to
[2:28:38.380 --> 2:28:42.540]  send research articles to bellmark back in 1961
[2:28:42.540 --> 2:28:48.300]  62 and 63 to the bert society is it just getting going i was doing a lot of
[2:28:48.300 --> 2:28:53.740]  research on my own on on fascism nazism communism all of the
[2:28:53.740 --> 2:28:57.820]  different uh movements of the bankers etc so i would
[2:28:57.820 --> 2:29:00.780]  just send again articles and sometimes i'd see
[2:29:00.780 --> 2:29:04.300]  some of their some of my work being incorporated into
[2:29:04.300 --> 2:29:10.940]  their literature and then i began to connect and with all kinds of researchers
[2:29:10.940 --> 2:29:15.580]  and writers and the more i learned the more i realized
[2:29:15.580 --> 2:29:20.060]  how much i don't know and i realized too that most people
[2:29:20.060 --> 2:29:24.620]  don't want to know and that that's what really frightened me because
[2:29:24.620 --> 2:29:28.060]  now we're we're faced with with something that is just
[2:29:28.060 --> 2:29:33.180]  absolutely beyond most people's ability to to even grasp
[2:29:33.180 --> 2:29:37.580]  and i i'm just i have no words for it because i know
[2:29:37.580 --> 2:29:42.380]  that this country and this republic cannot be saved
[2:29:42.380 --> 2:29:47.260]  as long as there's a flaw in your in the thinking of the people
[2:29:47.260 --> 2:29:52.780]  look at your decisions in life are only as good as your information
[2:29:52.780 --> 2:29:57.100]  and if you are not willing to look at all of the truth
[2:29:57.100 --> 2:30:00.860]  then you don't have it yet and as long as you don't have it all
[2:30:00.860 --> 2:30:04.140]  any attorney will tell you before going in the court if you don't have
[2:30:04.140 --> 2:30:07.340]  everything going for you then you don't go
[2:30:07.340 --> 2:30:11.580]  don't even try because you're not going to win because you don't know the facts
[2:30:11.580 --> 2:30:17.740]  yet so that's what i'm trying to do is help people to learn

[2:34:36.220 --> 2:34:39.500]  you know i took off last week and went with my family to the texas beach to
[2:34:39.500 --> 2:34:43.340]  spend a few days with them and while i was out on the beach
[2:34:43.340 --> 2:34:47.420]  i wrote notes about 20 pages of notes of what i thought
[2:34:47.420 --> 2:34:52.220]  was most important in life and one of the things i wrote in here
[2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:55.980]  is that i was really thinking about what makes me up
[2:34:55.980 --> 2:34:59.420]  who i am and i thought about being a young man and being ego driven and
[2:34:59.420 --> 2:35:03.500]  wanting to be tough and good-looking and wanting to get in fights with bullies
[2:35:03.500 --> 2:35:06.620]  and you know kind of those base
[2:35:06.620 --> 2:35:10.940]  uh you type things you do when you're young but that's normal
[2:35:10.940 --> 2:35:14.780]  it's a hierarchy of needs it's a it's a journey we're all on
[2:35:14.780 --> 2:35:20.540]  and i thought about how i still fall back into ego sometimes but less and less
[2:35:20.540 --> 2:35:24.700]  it's almost like a long lost uh forgotten friend
[2:35:24.700 --> 2:35:28.780]  because it's a great source of energy ego but it also blinds you
[2:35:28.780 --> 2:35:32.460]  and i remember decades ago people would tell me about ego i couldn't even
[2:35:32.460 --> 2:35:36.940]  grasp the concept even in psychology class because i was still so controlled
[2:35:36.940 --> 2:35:40.620]  by ego when i was 18 19 years old but now i understand what it is i'm
[2:35:40.620 --> 2:35:44.380]  totally separate from my quote mind i can
[2:35:44.380 --> 2:35:49.980]  pull back look at myself warts and all i can analyze what makes humans tick how
[2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:53.820]  we operate the basic engineering the basic genetics
[2:35:53.820 --> 2:35:57.900]  uh what our true values are what we're truly meant to do
[2:35:57.900 --> 2:36:04.060]  and at the final equation laying down your life for your neighbor
[2:36:04.060 --> 2:36:06.940]  means that you save yourself because when you have that attitude of laying down
[2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:09.980]  your life for your neighbor when you do have courage when you do care about
[2:36:09.980 --> 2:36:12.060]  others when you're not greedy and filled with hate
[2:36:12.060 --> 2:36:15.900]  when you're not just self-centered you truly are conscious and can now
[2:36:15.900 --> 2:36:19.660]  use your brain and you understand that in a society where we care about each
[2:36:19.660 --> 2:36:22.300]  other and that means sometimes fighting against evil
[2:36:22.300 --> 2:36:25.900]  that doesn't mean just laying back and being a wimp that you have a better
[2:36:25.900 --> 2:36:28.940]  society a dynamic system does it mean wherever perfect
[2:36:28.940 --> 2:36:33.020]  no but we're reaching towards something better
[2:36:33.020 --> 2:36:36.300]  and being there you know at the beach laying in the sand watching my children
[2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:40.940]  play and build sandcastles and you know saying god's beautiful creation
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:45.500]  you know the firmament you know just looking at how wonderful this world
[2:36:45.500 --> 2:36:48.540]  is and how madison avenue has trained us to feel
[2:36:48.540 --> 2:36:52.540]  inadequate to be unhappy to not see how great things are
[2:36:52.540 --> 2:36:55.740]  but to not also be able to see all the evil that's in the world at the same
[2:36:55.740 --> 2:36:59.420]  time people are basically blind to the beauty and blind to the ugliness
[2:36:59.420 --> 2:37:02.380]  they've been stunted and kind of shrunken down they're looking at the
[2:37:02.380 --> 2:37:07.980]  world through a straw they're seeing such a limited
[2:37:07.980 --> 2:37:12.780]  perspective and i have a desire to see them have pleasure
[2:37:12.780 --> 2:37:17.340]  i have a desire to see them be free i have a desire to see them do well
[2:37:17.340 --> 2:37:21.100]  i have a desire kind of a builder's desire which is what we're all meant to
[2:37:21.100 --> 2:37:25.500]  be creators to see their minds unlocked and i have
[2:37:25.500 --> 2:37:30.460]  a desire to learn more and to challenge myself and to really know the
[2:37:30.460 --> 2:37:33.660]  truth and it's painful to realize that a
[2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:36.780]  lot of them don't want to do that and they want to be caught in snares and
[2:37:36.780 --> 2:37:40.300]  they want to be killed and they want to have fluoride put in their water and
[2:37:40.300 --> 2:37:43.260]  they want to be injected with cancer and they want to give their kids mercury
[2:37:43.260 --> 2:37:45.740]  shots and and and and they don't want to know the
[2:37:45.740 --> 2:37:48.700]  truth and and i wanted to ask jordan this question
[2:37:48.700 --> 2:37:52.700]  or make the statement and get his take on it and i and i wrote here in a little
[2:37:52.700 --> 2:37:57.580]  book uh that that i realized that the
[2:37:57.580 --> 2:38:00.620]  instinct to want to build something better for the tribe
[2:38:00.620 --> 2:38:04.460]  is a human instinct and to and to realize that the human community is
[2:38:04.460 --> 2:38:09.020]  bigger than just yourself and that i want to
[2:38:09.020 --> 2:38:12.460]  pass better things on to people and that all the good things we have
[2:38:12.460 --> 2:38:16.380]  is because other good people before us pass them on to us
[2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:19.340]  and there's always been this struggle of good and evil
[2:38:19.340 --> 2:38:23.020]  within our own species that's being directed and controlled from above and
[2:38:23.020 --> 2:38:27.980]  you can debate what that intelligence is and jordan gets into that but
[2:38:27.980 --> 2:38:32.140]  certainly for those that have studied it's there and the elite know it's there
[2:38:32.140 --> 2:38:36.380]  and communicate with it with both sides of it or whatever it is
[2:38:36.380 --> 2:38:40.940]  god uh but but but then they control it and put out a false fact similarly
[2:38:40.940 --> 2:38:45.500]  for the public but but my only message is is that i'm not just some do-gooder
[2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:49.180]  i want to transmit knowledge i want to tell people the mistakes i've made
[2:38:49.180 --> 2:38:52.460]  i want to let them know i want them to see pitfalls
[2:38:52.460 --> 2:38:55.820]  and i want to write i want to make films and it's because
[2:38:55.820 --> 2:38:59.820]  i want to communicate with the future and i can almost feel
[2:38:59.820 --> 2:39:04.460]  tangibly i do feel it but i you know is it a facsimile in my mind or is it real
[2:39:04.460 --> 2:39:08.940]  the bouncing back from the future the information i've already put out
[2:39:08.940 --> 2:39:12.620]  i can feel the good it's created and i can feel it tangibly
[2:39:12.620 --> 2:39:15.740]  coming back at me from the future and i know
[2:39:15.740 --> 2:39:20.220]  that i stand on the shoulders of those in the past and i can feel myself
[2:39:20.220 --> 2:39:25.660]  with my ancestors and others looking back into the past and into the future
[2:39:25.660 --> 2:39:29.580]  and if you really look down to what makes alex jones tick at the end of the day
[2:39:29.580 --> 2:39:33.020]  when jordan was just talking i was going to share this later in the week
[2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:36.460]  it's that i want to make things better for those in the future
[2:39:36.460 --> 2:39:40.380]  because i live on through them i live on through their pleasure and their pain
[2:39:40.380 --> 2:39:43.820]  and their exaltation and and and the births and the deaths
[2:39:43.820 --> 2:39:48.140]  and the lives that were all part of a larger species like a cell
[2:39:48.140 --> 2:39:52.780]  in a larger organism and the new world order knows that and tries to block us
[2:39:52.780 --> 2:39:56.780]  off from ever becoming truly human and communing
[2:39:56.780 --> 2:40:00.300]  with our own species in the universe jordan i didn't mean to spend five minutes
[2:40:00.300 --> 2:40:03.100]  because i want to hear everything you have to say but i i wanted to say that
[2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:06.460]  to you because when you talked about wanting to know wanting to warn others
[2:40:06.460 --> 2:40:11.340]  having this drive this instinct and i absolutely am a kindred spirit with you
[2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:15.660]  on that point is that i have this desire to warn people and to know and to
[2:40:15.660 --> 2:40:21.980]  learn more myself well alex i'm so happy that you said those
[2:40:21.980 --> 2:40:24.620]  things because that's exactly what i was going to say
[2:40:24.620 --> 2:40:28.380]  so and i'm i'm older and more tired than you are so
[2:40:28.380 --> 2:40:33.420]  you said it's so much better than i would have said it that's exactly what i feel
[2:40:33.420 --> 2:40:37.820]  precisely what you said is exactly what i feel when i was young
[2:40:37.820 --> 2:40:42.300]  when i was younger i i was filled with the zeal for knowledge and wisdom and
[2:40:42.300 --> 2:40:47.900]  understanding it and questioning everything and talking to all the
[2:40:47.900 --> 2:40:52.540]  adults that were that were out there writing and speaking publicly
[2:40:52.540 --> 2:40:56.860]  i love knowledge and i love the idea of helping my fellow man i love
[2:40:56.860 --> 2:41:01.420]  watching young people uh their eyes light up when you show them something
[2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:06.220]  they've they've never seen before uh it's it's the instinct of a teacher and
[2:41:06.220 --> 2:41:11.020]  the more the older i grew the more i loved talking to audiences and helping
[2:41:11.020 --> 2:41:15.420]  them to understand because there's a you know like the apostle paul says do you
[2:41:15.420 --> 2:41:19.420]  not uh teach yourself when helping others so i was
[2:41:19.420 --> 2:41:23.260]  learning and i was trying to transmit all the things i was learning to other
[2:41:23.260 --> 2:41:29.980]  people but when i took my work publicly back in 1988 i decided to go public and
[2:41:29.980 --> 2:41:34.140]  instead of the little mickey mouse venues that i had been speaking at the
[2:41:34.140 --> 2:41:39.900]  little mom and pop uh uh bookstore you emerged from
[2:41:39.900 --> 2:41:44.780]  the underground yes yes i had been speaking at that uh
[2:41:44.780 --> 2:41:48.780]  little venues small little venues around los angeles
[2:41:48.780 --> 2:41:55.660]  as far back as 1961 and 62 i was giving lectures in libraries and little small
[2:41:55.660 --> 2:41:59.820]  groups uh ladies home groups and all these little
[2:41:59.820 --> 2:42:04.140]  venues on secret societies bible codes night
[2:42:04.140 --> 2:42:10.300]  templars uh nazi fascism all of the different secret societies that were
[2:42:10.300 --> 2:42:13.980]  operating and how they were connected behind the scenes in european blood
[2:42:13.980 --> 2:42:18.540]  lines all of that back in 60s early 60s but it
[2:42:18.540 --> 2:42:24.460]  wasn't until i uh was introduced to um the work of
[2:42:24.460 --> 2:42:27.740]  myron fagan anthony hill to put out the records
[2:42:27.740 --> 2:42:33.820]  set on iluma nati that was in late 66 well i got a copy of it almost
[2:42:33.820 --> 2:42:37.580]  right after they came out and all the pieces came together
[2:42:37.580 --> 2:42:41.100]  all of it came together and all began to make sense
[2:42:41.100 --> 2:42:45.260]  of the things which i was already interested in let me interrupt briefly
[2:42:45.260 --> 2:42:48.860]  and and and see if you're on the same page or can expand
[2:42:48.860 --> 2:42:52.540]  and this is for people that are listeners of mine and think that i know
[2:42:52.540 --> 2:42:55.980]  more jordan knows more than you do let me explain something when you get so
[2:42:55.980 --> 2:42:59.340]  close to a problem and you understand the different sectors of it you can be
[2:42:59.340 --> 2:43:02.860]  called a master of you know understanding the new world order as
[2:43:02.860 --> 2:43:06.060]  jordan said you realize how much you don't know
[2:43:06.060 --> 2:43:09.660]  and and and so i would imagine you discovered thousands of things that
[2:43:09.660 --> 2:43:13.820]  myron fagan didn't know but that was the last piece
[2:43:13.820 --> 2:43:17.420]  or the master key the wrote the the the rosetta stone
[2:43:17.420 --> 2:43:20.940]  exactly that that that the tumblers flipped and then you went
[2:43:20.940 --> 2:43:24.060]  because i know your research to a whole new level past him
[2:43:24.060 --> 2:43:27.580]  but we have to understand that it was that step that brought you to the next
[2:43:27.580 --> 2:43:31.100]  level and then you bring others and then and then you learn more from new
[2:43:31.100 --> 2:43:33.740]  people and then we just exponentially learn go ahead
[2:43:33.740 --> 2:43:37.500]  that's exactly right and and and so i was then
[2:43:37.500 --> 2:43:43.900]  hot on the track of illuminati as a as a philosophical concept
[2:43:43.900 --> 2:43:47.580]  and uh and so i was living in ucla libraries
[2:43:47.580 --> 2:43:51.740]  usc uh berkeley i was all over the state
[2:43:51.740 --> 2:43:55.500]  and going to i personally went to all of those because we didn't have the
[2:43:55.500 --> 2:43:59.820]  computers and and the thing you know the technology we have today so i
[2:43:59.820 --> 2:44:05.420]  personally spent years at ucla's research library general
[2:44:05.420 --> 2:44:09.740]  research uh usc i used to spend days and
[2:44:09.740 --> 2:44:15.740]  with weeks and months at usc and the stacks late at night photocopying
[2:44:15.740 --> 2:44:21.260]  documents from old books and so the more i learned the more i knew how
[2:44:21.260 --> 2:44:25.660]  much i didn't know and i was fascinated with every
[2:44:25.660 --> 2:44:30.060]  day i was learning things and and there's a depth of spirit
[2:44:30.060 --> 2:44:34.460]  was bringing me people and bringing things to me because it's as if
[2:44:34.460 --> 2:44:37.740]  the spirit in the universe knew that i wanted to know
[2:44:37.740 --> 2:44:42.540]  and that i was eager to learn and so i was meeting all kinds of interesting
[2:44:42.540 --> 2:44:47.340]  people and uh i was just blowing my mind and
[2:44:47.340 --> 2:44:53.580]  and then uh like i said about 1988 after i i had a nervous breakdown because i
[2:44:53.580 --> 2:44:56.780]  lost my wife i lost my family i lost everything
[2:44:56.780 --> 2:45:01.020]  uh but those things happened in life and but i wasn't ready for it and too
[2:45:01.020 --> 2:45:04.220]  much of it came too too quickly and it just
[2:45:04.220 --> 2:45:07.820]  overwhelmed me and i just broke down but when i came
[2:45:07.820 --> 2:45:11.340]  did you lose your wife because of the research was she sick of it
[2:45:11.340 --> 2:45:14.700]  yes yeah because she decided that she had had enough of me
[2:45:14.700 --> 2:45:18.940]  and whatever it was that was driving me she wanted no part of it
[2:45:18.940 --> 2:45:22.140]  all the time i was living with her she never wanted to hear
[2:45:22.140 --> 2:45:25.340]  anything that i was interested yeah richard gaige's wife architects and
[2:45:25.340 --> 2:45:28.780]  engineers 911 truth left him over this stuff it's really sad i'm
[2:45:28.780 --> 2:45:33.260]  blessed to have my wife and so uh and so i you know that was a
[2:45:33.260 --> 2:45:37.500]  terrible blow to me because uh she just decided she got enough that's it she
[2:45:37.500 --> 2:45:41.740]  doesn't it doesn't want she used to tell me all the time why don't you just get
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:46.060]  a job and be like everybody else and just go along to get along and i said
[2:45:46.060 --> 2:45:50.780]  my god did not bring me into this world to go along to get along my god
[2:45:50.780 --> 2:45:55.100]  brought me here to be who i am and to do what i do
[2:45:55.100 --> 2:45:59.660]  i have a high respect for the for the concept of the divine
[2:45:59.660 --> 2:46:03.900]  force in the universe that men call god i believe that people
[2:46:03.900 --> 2:46:07.740]  certain people are brought here purposely to do work
[2:46:07.740 --> 2:46:11.740]  and and uh so i i have a very high regard for
[2:46:11.740 --> 2:46:15.980]  spiritual things but not for the but not for the whorehouse churches that are
[2:46:15.980 --> 2:46:21.180]  eliminated role yeah not not for the corporation silly bull that we call
[2:46:21.180 --> 2:46:25.100]  the religions today jumping around on stages and
[2:46:25.100 --> 2:46:28.620]  with the diamond rings and their effeminate haircuts and
[2:46:28.620 --> 2:46:32.860]  jumping around falling down in and it's just an incredible
[2:46:32.860 --> 2:46:40.620]  uh display of stupidity look at i'll think about this if you were to go to a
[2:46:40.620 --> 2:46:45.820]  a particular school for 40 years and study one subject for 40 years and
[2:46:45.820 --> 2:46:50.220]  one day come out of that out of that 40 years of study
[2:46:50.220 --> 2:46:55.740]  and can't even read or or form a sentence correctly
[2:46:55.740 --> 2:47:00.060]  and cannot hold an intelligent conversation with your fellow man
[2:47:00.060 --> 2:47:04.300]  what kind of a school is that that that you spent all your life in and can't
[2:47:04.300 --> 2:47:07.740]  even read well the same thing is true with so
[2:47:07.740 --> 2:47:11.100]  many christians who have been christians all their life
[2:47:11.100 --> 2:47:15.900]  and spent all their life or pursuing a church teachings
[2:47:15.900 --> 2:47:20.380]  and have no idea in the world what certain words mean
[2:47:20.380 --> 2:47:24.540]  the etymology of words and terms and symbols
[2:47:24.540 --> 2:47:29.900]  corporate logos flags howlatory where concepts have come from the
[2:47:29.900 --> 2:47:33.020]  obvious it's it's all the complete opposite
[2:47:33.020 --> 2:47:36.780]  opposite totally opposite than what you think it is
[2:47:36.780 --> 2:47:42.460]  well well i mean that's the issue uh and they have been hidden all those guys
[2:47:42.460 --> 2:47:45.180]  and it's turned out they get government financing to start them off
[2:47:45.180 --> 2:47:49.500]  to make it look stupid to actually turn spiritual people off
[2:47:49.500 --> 2:47:52.940]  and i've noticed i want to get your take on this that the illuminati the
[2:47:52.940 --> 2:47:56.220]  globalist are all whether it's dead turner
[2:47:56.220 --> 2:48:00.620]  morris strong prince philip david rocker fellow they're all
[2:48:00.620 --> 2:48:05.340]  deeply occultic deeply into this a little bit on it
[2:48:05.340 --> 2:48:08.700]  this illuminati religion of killing their fellow humans for the greater good of
[2:48:08.700 --> 2:48:12.060]  gaya but then they finance all the atheist groups
[2:48:12.060 --> 2:48:17.020]  to tell people there's nothing so so so they really want to turn people off
[2:48:17.020 --> 2:48:20.940]  from a true spiritual experience don't they that's exactly right there is a
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:26.700]  world of difference between being a religious and truly spiritual a true
[2:48:26.700 --> 2:48:30.300]  spiritual person is exactly what the bible has jesus
[2:48:30.300 --> 2:48:34.140]  saying go into your inner chambers a ghost in place by yourself
[2:48:34.140 --> 2:48:38.940]  and pray it pray by yourself to to your father
[2:48:38.940 --> 2:48:42.380]  you don't need to dance around on the stage with diamond rings and
[2:48:42.380 --> 2:48:49.820]  and uh and make a fool of jumping around uh you know spirituality is between
[2:48:49.820 --> 2:48:54.220]  you and your creator and and i've always understood that
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:48:58.700]  and and i and i'm just amazed at how many people buy into
[2:48:58.700 --> 2:49:03.420]  never even asking the questions where are these people
[2:49:03.420 --> 2:49:09.740]  getting the money uh it's just uh i i don't have words for it
[2:49:09.740 --> 2:49:17.180]  tbn typical tbn they got they got statues of uh of uh pagan gods
[2:49:17.180 --> 2:49:23.740]  in their uh in their yards bakas dionesis uh one of the uh gods that
[2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:28.060]  has been used to represent satan is out there in tbn's
[2:49:28.060 --> 2:49:32.140]  courtyard the very symbol that the christianity
[2:49:32.140 --> 2:49:36.220]  is used for the devil is sitting in tbn's courtyard
[2:49:36.220 --> 2:49:41.180]  but consequently nobody reads nobody also have copies of the babeloni and
[2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:44.940]  altar in some of their tv shows with plants sitting on it
[2:49:44.940 --> 2:49:48.700]  right in front of everybody uh the one that was ish ish right in your face
[2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:52.220]  absolutely what's the name of that altar that the bible says is satan's seat
[2:49:52.220 --> 2:49:54.780]  and they have copies of it on tv right in front of you
[2:49:54.780 --> 2:49:59.420]  yeah and the trees the trees all around tbn as you walk around you'll see

[2:50:16.620 --> 2:50:20.380]  everywhere everywhere you go you see sexual symbols
[2:50:20.380 --> 2:50:24.700]  occult stuff and college admittedly has all his homosexual
[2:50:24.700 --> 2:50:28.700]  mistresses but then he speaks out against uh gay people on his show

[2:55:16.460 --> 2:55:20.700]  hey they are the mind is an incredible thing
[2:55:20.700 --> 2:55:24.780]  if they will fully want to be stupid and want to be in denial
[2:55:24.780 --> 2:55:29.900]  their mind will engineer itself to build into that reality that's what
[2:55:29.900 --> 2:55:34.140]  jordan was saying earlier they will decide to believe the
[2:55:34.140 --> 2:55:37.340]  lie
[2:55:37.340 --> 2:55:42.700]  they will decide to be fools i can have the chicago tribute admitting
[2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:46.700]  dinecore and halliburton kidnapped over a million women and children put them
[2:55:46.700 --> 2:55:50.060]  in slave camps sell them to people to make
[2:55:50.060 --> 2:55:53.580]  snuff films they even admit it in the newspaper
[2:55:53.580 --> 2:55:58.700]  nobody goes to jail trillions are missing from the pentagon
[2:55:58.700 --> 2:56:01.820]  i have all the government documents where they put cancer viruses in the
[2:56:01.820 --> 2:56:06.460]  vaccines poisons in our water you tell a yuppie that and
[2:56:06.460 --> 2:56:11.100]  they just laugh at you it's funny to them it's funny
[2:56:11.100 --> 2:56:14.700]  because they couldn't face the reality of how horrifying
[2:56:14.700 --> 2:56:18.780]  it really is they are cowards and and and and
[2:56:18.780 --> 2:56:22.620]  i'm not somebody full of courage if somebody's attacking me i want to stop
[2:56:22.620 --> 2:56:25.740]  it but see these cowards are so cowardly they
[2:56:25.740 --> 2:56:28.860]  could have a lion ripping their guts out and they'd probably deny it and go
[2:56:28.860 --> 2:56:33.740]  into a blackout and say a lion isn't tearing my guts out
[2:56:33.740 --> 2:56:37.740]  kind of like the fella being tortured in brazil he goes off into la la land
[2:56:37.740 --> 2:56:40.380]  and at the end of the film they're cutting his hand off and he's sitting
[2:56:40.380 --> 2:56:44.380]  there humming happily in his mind and they say oh he's left us i'm afraid
[2:56:44.380 --> 2:56:48.140]  you know the public has left us i'm afraid jordan maxwell
[2:56:48.140 --> 2:56:52.860]  uh your take on the comments i just made boy i can't comment on it because you
[2:56:52.860 --> 2:56:57.100]  said exactly what i'm thinking that's precisely the point that the public has
[2:56:57.100 --> 2:57:01.340]  left their sanity they they have been robbed of their sanity and their
[2:57:01.340 --> 2:57:05.340]  humanity and um i you know and i don't know
[2:57:05.340 --> 2:57:09.180]  what to do about it at this point i just do the best i can
[2:57:09.180 --> 2:57:12.940]  to uh try and help people who want to be helped
[2:57:12.940 --> 2:57:16.140]  those who don't want to hear i'm not going to hear a dating wait so finishing
[2:57:16.140 --> 2:57:20.940]  up with crouch though i grew up by bob tilton larry lee
[2:57:20.940 --> 2:57:26.540]  uh a bunch of other preachers and and and i didn't see the leaves doing a
[2:57:26.540 --> 2:57:30.140]  bunch of party and but but but with tilton and some others
[2:57:30.140 --> 2:57:34.140]  i mean i saw incredible stuff that i won't even say on air in our neighborhood
[2:57:34.140 --> 2:57:38.860]  oh i know i can imagine that's what i'm talking about but people love it i
[2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:42.140]  mean every time you turn on television the police have just
[2:57:42.140 --> 2:57:45.100]  crowded with people and they're just enjoying it
[2:57:45.100 --> 2:57:49.420]  and what it just blows my mind on this is that
[2:57:49.420 --> 2:57:52.700]  you you see thousands and thousands of people
[2:57:52.700 --> 2:57:57.100]  you know uh coming to these churches to listen
[2:57:57.100 --> 2:58:04.060]  and uh they're learning nothing actually intellectually learning
[2:58:04.060 --> 2:58:08.620]  nothing and uh you know in 20 years later they're still jumping around
[2:58:08.620 --> 2:58:11.900]  seeking the elms and loving the lord and have no
[2:58:11.900 --> 2:58:15.980]  idea in the world that the lord that the lord is
[2:58:15.980 --> 2:58:20.460]  is his bathroom yeah it's just in incredible
[2:58:20.460 --> 2:58:25.980]  ignorance people who cannot read they don't think they don't question anything
[2:58:25.980 --> 2:58:31.660]  uh it's just uh and and that's why the entire human race is going under
[2:58:31.660 --> 2:58:35.900]  because the human family have lost their ability to even
[2:58:35.900 --> 2:58:39.340]  think now now jordan we got to start the next hour

[3:01:27.500 --> 3:01:31.420]  people tried to even get us to you know pick fights with each other they tried
[3:01:31.420 --> 3:01:34.460]  to get other people to do it i've noticed you never get involved in all
[3:01:34.460 --> 3:01:38.780]  that uh jordan but you you have pioneered so much of the
[3:01:38.780 --> 3:01:43.180]  research that is now the mainstay of a lot of people out there
[3:01:43.180 --> 3:01:46.780]  uh and then i get people emailing me saying what's going on with
[3:01:46.780 --> 3:01:49.980]  uh jordan maxwell in this researcher what's going on with jordan maxwell in
[3:01:49.980 --> 3:01:52.700]  that researcher and then i go look it up and find out you've
[3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:55.980]  said nothing or done nothing and then and then and that's how the
[3:01:55.980 --> 3:01:58.540]  dis info people they're key at getting us to fight with each
[3:01:58.540 --> 3:02:02.140]  other uh but just on uh record i mean tell me about
[3:02:02.140 --> 3:02:05.180]  some of the people you woke up to the new world order some of the people you
[3:02:05.180 --> 3:02:08.700]  educated who then kind of took your work and then added on to it or did their
[3:02:08.700 --> 3:02:11.180]  own thing i mean i mean go through some of the folks
[3:02:11.180 --> 3:02:14.460]  that uh that we could say that you you know first
[3:02:14.460 --> 3:02:20.380]  matter that you woke up well i mean a classic example is back in 88 when i
[3:02:20.380 --> 3:02:26.060]  first started going public i had a a family that i was very close to out
[3:02:26.060 --> 3:02:31.580]  here and uh one of the uh boys um i mean one of
[3:02:31.580 --> 3:02:37.100]  the girls in the family a name which uh uh gloria gloria was a
[3:02:37.100 --> 3:02:40.700]  young girl she used to come over to my office in glendale when i was
[3:02:40.700 --> 3:02:45.100]  first going public and she would tell me about how she just
[3:02:45.100 --> 3:02:49.260]  loved what i was doing and loved all the research and i knew her i knew the
[3:02:49.260 --> 3:02:53.100]  family and so i suspected nothing and she asked if she could
[3:02:53.100 --> 3:02:56.380]  photocopy all my documents and materials that i was
[3:02:56.380 --> 3:03:01.980]  working on after a course so i gave her boxes upon boxes over a two-day period
[3:03:01.980 --> 3:03:05.820]  there was a photocopy shop in the building i was in so she just
[3:03:05.820 --> 3:03:10.220]  spent all day all afternoon and all evening photocopying
[3:03:10.220 --> 3:03:14.700]  all the research materials and documents and everything that i had
[3:03:14.700 --> 3:03:18.380]  and later on about a year later i get a phone call from a
[3:03:18.380 --> 3:03:21.820]  mutual friend that knew both gloria and myself
[3:03:21.820 --> 3:03:26.460]  and said jordan uh you know there's a new book out with all of your work in it
[3:03:26.460 --> 3:03:31.900]  uh the guy's name is fritz springmeyer it's called bloodlines of the illuminati
[3:03:31.900 --> 3:03:37.020]  and i was shocked and i so i called fritz springmeyer and i said fritz what is
[3:03:37.020 --> 3:03:41.900]  this book bloodlines of the illuminati and he said well
[3:03:41.900 --> 3:03:45.420]  jordan anybody could have done that kind of research anybody could have done
[3:03:45.420 --> 3:03:50.540]  that i said yeah anyone could have done it but it was me that did it
[3:03:50.540 --> 3:03:54.140]  and consequently uh you know now it's a big book out there bloodlines the
[3:03:54.140 --> 3:03:57.420]  illuminati which fritz springmeyer got from jordan
[3:03:57.420 --> 3:04:00.700]  Maxwell and never even said thank you i mean i
[3:04:00.700 --> 3:04:04.460]  i gave uh john rapoport a job but he didn't have a job
[3:04:04.460 --> 3:04:08.140]  and sat for hours with john rapoport and told him about my work in
[3:04:08.140 --> 3:04:12.540]  san diego when i brought him in and hired him to work with me
[3:04:12.540 --> 3:04:16.860]  later on he creates a book called the secret behind secret societies yeah
[3:04:16.860 --> 3:04:21.740]  it's all my work and of course i work with richard hogland and i said zachariah
[3:04:21.740 --> 3:04:24.300]  stitching around the world five times and
[3:04:24.300 --> 3:04:27.820]  i have met the company of truth seekers i had a lot of
[3:04:27.820 --> 3:04:30.940]  and zachariah had the highest respect for a wonderful man
[3:04:30.940 --> 3:04:35.260]  and the richard hogland still a great fan of mine but i've worked with so many
[3:04:35.260 --> 3:04:39.020]  people and and then when i hear uh lecturers like
[3:04:39.020 --> 3:04:42.620]  jim marz and tex marz especially jim marz talking about
[3:04:42.620 --> 3:04:47.180]  illuminati and secret societies i think hell i was talking about that stuff
[3:04:47.180 --> 3:04:53.500]  back in 62 i was talking about that 45 years ago but jordan i mean you
[3:04:53.500 --> 3:04:58.380]  that's also a sign of your success uh and and myron fagans and others that
[3:04:58.380 --> 3:05:03.180]  we do want other people to go out and and and put the information out
[3:05:03.180 --> 3:05:06.860]  of course we do but i could certainly see in a case where
[3:05:06.860 --> 3:05:09.420]  you think somebody went and got your material and then put into a book and
[3:05:09.420 --> 3:05:15.340]  gave you no credit uh that is uh bad but i mean at the same time um
[3:05:15.340 --> 3:05:19.100]  well hold on we're gonna continue on through this break for folks on the
[3:05:19.100 --> 3:05:22.700]  internet talking and we'll come back for everybody else in this

[3:08:35.660 --> 3:08:40.700]  uh very you know helping generous person
[3:08:40.700 --> 3:08:45.660]  and i talked to him on and off air his main point is
[3:08:45.660 --> 3:08:48.700]  and i like you said in your own words is that it's not that only that people
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:50.780]  take a lot of his work and don't give him credit
[3:08:50.780 --> 3:08:54.780]  it's that he then gets emails and post about oh this person
[3:08:54.780 --> 3:08:59.180]  came out with this and jordan took it uh and i think that's and then people
[3:08:59.180 --> 3:09:02.860]  start fights up between people and uh was just talking to jordan he's
[3:09:02.860 --> 3:09:06.060]  saying he won't be doing very many interviews in the future it was hard to
[3:09:06.060 --> 3:09:08.780]  give and get jordan on we called him a few months ago he said he wasn't doing
[3:09:08.780 --> 3:09:12.460]  interviews anymore and then later he called back and said okay i'll come on
[3:09:12.460 --> 3:09:16.220]  which we're very thankful for he is ill he needs our support he needs our
[3:09:16.220 --> 3:09:19.340]  financial support he deserves that and we'll tell you how to get some of his
[3:09:19.340 --> 3:09:22.700]  books and videos before he leaves us they're all at jordanmaxwell.com
[3:09:22.700 --> 3:09:24.300]  i mean there you go but we'll talk more about him
[3:09:24.300 --> 3:09:28.540]  but i mean let's walk through that specifically on your own words
[3:09:28.540 --> 3:09:32.140]  uh you were telling me during the last a little uh behind the scenes interview
[3:09:32.140 --> 3:09:36.780]  we were doing for the prison planet dot tv viewers that that that yes
[3:09:36.780 --> 3:09:40.220]  that people make these fights up and i think it is people in the government
[3:09:40.220 --> 3:09:43.980]  and this info to to to get researchers fighting
[3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:47.100]  where people will then say jordan maxwell took this guy's research and
[3:09:47.100 --> 3:09:51.260]  you're laughing because you were around 40 years before they even showed up
[3:09:51.260 --> 3:09:54.780]  you were around before i was a zygote in my mother's
[3:09:54.780 --> 3:09:58.780]  womb you were you were doing this you know 40 years
[3:09:58.780 --> 3:10:03.020]  uh before uh you know other people popped up on the scene
[3:10:03.020 --> 3:10:06.700]  i've said that even in two audiences that some of the people that are
[3:10:06.700 --> 3:10:09.740]  out there talking today about this subject
[3:10:09.740 --> 3:10:13.420]  of secret societies the illuminati
[3:10:13.420 --> 3:10:17.580]  bible codes knights Templars international banking
[3:10:17.580 --> 3:10:23.100]  all of that stuff i was talking about back in the 60s early 60s 62 like i said
[3:10:23.100 --> 3:10:27.500]  at the beginning i said i used to send a lot of articles to
[3:10:27.500 --> 3:10:34.060]  the birth society way back in 60 61 i was giving a lecture in downtown
[3:10:34.060 --> 3:10:37.660]  hollywood in east hollywood to a christian group
[3:10:37.660 --> 3:10:41.500]  uh uh the day that john kennedy was assassinated
[3:10:41.500 --> 3:10:44.860]  i was giving a lecture in downtown hollywood
[3:10:44.860 --> 3:10:52.140]  um on secret societies and occult religions in 1963 when kennedy was
[3:10:52.140 --> 3:10:56.060]  assassination i i've been talking about this stuff for 48 years
[3:10:56.060 --> 3:10:59.740]  well we we owe a debt to you uh i mean let's briefly talk about some of the
[3:10:59.740 --> 3:11:03.660]  shoulders that you and others stand on so that we can stand on yours in this
[3:11:03.660 --> 3:11:07.500]  fight against tyranny and lies and fraud and dehumanization and greed and
[3:11:07.500 --> 3:11:10.380]  control they were saying myron fagan what about
[3:11:10.380 --> 3:11:13.660]  eustace mollins i mean his work on the fellow reserve he really was
[3:11:13.660 --> 3:11:18.300]  the guy helping get the uh book oh yeah oh yeah and eustace mollins did
[3:11:18.300 --> 3:11:22.460]  tremendous research for days and weeks and months
[3:11:22.460 --> 3:11:26.620]  uh writing and has paid the price for as we're bound i mean he helped get as
[3:11:26.620 --> 3:11:30.540]  repelled absolutely and uh and many before that
[3:11:30.540 --> 3:11:34.940]  so uh and i've always said and and i'm famous for saying that that i'm not
[3:11:34.940 --> 3:11:38.060]  the world's foremost authority on anything right
[3:11:38.060 --> 3:11:42.540]  i'm just a next uh an ordinary man interested in extraordinary knowledge
[3:11:42.540 --> 3:11:45.980]  well i think the key here is though you codified so much evident before you
[3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:48.700]  came along you'd have to go read a hundred
[3:11:48.700 --> 3:11:51.740]  high level masonic books you'd have to go to the libraries
[3:11:51.740 --> 3:11:56.460]  look at the real meanings of gods so what you did is that knowledge was there
[3:11:56.460 --> 3:11:59.500]  but but that was kind of their internal knowledge
[3:11:59.500 --> 3:12:02.780]  and and so you did bring to the world so much
[3:12:02.780 --> 3:12:07.580]  what's going on today i i've seen online a little you know people trying to
[3:12:07.580 --> 3:12:10.860]  create a controversy between you and david i tell me i mean just to set the
[3:12:10.860 --> 3:12:14.220]  record straight because people try to stir up stuff between you guys
[3:12:14.220 --> 3:12:16.460]  let's set the record straight what's really happening there
[3:12:16.460 --> 3:12:19.820]  well i i appreciate that because i've been wanting to talk about this for a
[3:12:19.820 --> 3:12:24.620]  long time because there is a lot i get a lot of emails and phone calls about
[3:12:24.620 --> 3:12:28.380]  well you said this about david ike or david ike said that
[3:12:28.380 --> 3:12:32.620]  first of all i don't have any problems with anything david ike is talking
[3:12:32.620 --> 3:12:36.300]  about as a matter of fact i you know i i gave him a
[3:12:36.300 --> 3:12:42.940]  lot and he's gotten a lot from me but i did in point of fact myself in 1992 i
[3:12:42.940 --> 3:12:47.100]  brought david ike to america i'm the one that brought him here
[3:12:47.100 --> 3:12:53.180]  and uh i was in san diego at the time and a young lady named um uh
[3:12:53.180 --> 3:12:58.540]  alice fergusson came to my office in san diego with another with a man a
[3:12:58.540 --> 3:13:03.420]  friend of hers named david griffit and alice fergusson david griffit came to
[3:13:03.420 --> 3:13:08.140]  my office i was i was pretty much running a company down in san diego
[3:13:08.140 --> 3:13:13.020]  called truth-seeker company and uh she asked me if i would help bring her
[3:13:13.020 --> 3:13:17.740]  friend to america who who was doing who was very interested in all my work and
[3:13:17.740 --> 3:13:21.980]  he was trying to do the same thing in england so i said well who is this
[3:13:21.980 --> 3:13:27.020]  person and so she said is david ike so i listened to her for about an hour and
[3:13:27.020 --> 3:13:30.540]  we talked about it and i said all right i'll tell you what i'll do i'll
[3:13:30.540 --> 3:13:37.100]  i'll give both you and david griffin a job i'll pay both of you $2,500 a month
[3:13:37.100 --> 3:13:40.540]  and uh and i'll get you because they didn't have a place to live they were
[3:13:40.540 --> 3:13:44.220]  over here to promote david ike and they didn't have a place to live they were
[3:13:44.220 --> 3:13:48.220]  staying with some friends in san diego so i got them both in apartment
[3:13:48.220 --> 3:13:52.940]  i gave them both $3,000 a piece to buy furniture for their apartments
[3:13:52.940 --> 3:13:56.700]  i gave them both a job for 2,500 bucks a month plus
[3:13:56.700 --> 3:14:00.460]  they both both had the credit cards for the
[3:14:00.460 --> 3:14:06.380]  foundation the corporation and i and so i i financed her
[3:14:06.380 --> 3:14:10.940]  alice fergusson david and ultimately uh david ike
[3:14:10.940 --> 3:14:14.780]  to come to america to go to australia to go to canada
[3:14:14.780 --> 3:14:19.260]  and all of that cost money to fly all over the world and to set up lectures for
[3:14:19.260 --> 3:14:24.620]  david ike and uh and eventually uh alice fergusson
[3:14:24.620 --> 3:14:29.020]  talked with uh bonnie line the the the lady who was running the company and
[3:14:29.020 --> 3:14:33.340]  a couple of other women in the office and they decided that why don't we just
[3:14:33.340 --> 3:14:37.020]  fire jordan maxwell get rid of him and bring david ike in
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:40.700]  to take his place and so that's what happened i got fired
[3:14:40.700 --> 3:14:45.420]  uh by the same people that i tried to help and bring david ike to america
[3:14:45.420 --> 3:14:49.180]  i got fired so that david could take my job
[3:14:49.180 --> 3:14:52.940]  but after they fired me that just they found out that david was not interested
[3:14:52.940 --> 3:14:57.100]  in sitting in an office running a company like jordan maxwell so then the
[3:14:57.100 --> 3:15:00.620]  company went downhill from there because i was gone
[3:15:00.620 --> 3:15:04.700]  and they had already fired me and david didn't want the job
[3:15:04.700 --> 3:15:08.300]  and so they just cut their nose off despite their face and so the truth
[3:15:08.300 --> 3:15:11.740]  sticker company is now defunct and it's no longer around
[3:15:11.740 --> 3:15:18.060]  of course i at that time i was helping uh because i had access to the corporation
[3:15:18.060 --> 3:15:22.140]  funds i was i was helping uh richard hogland zacharia
[3:15:22.140 --> 3:15:26.780]  sitchin as i said john rapaport was no had no job i called
[3:15:26.780 --> 3:15:32.060]  john rapaport gave him a job got him started again and uh
[3:15:32.060 --> 3:15:35.580]  he went out and wrote a book on my work called secret behind the
[3:15:35.580 --> 3:15:40.860]  secret societies uh so all you know i and of course i don't know if you were
[3:15:40.860 --> 3:15:44.140]  if we were on the air at the time when we were talking about the
[3:15:44.140 --> 3:15:47.980]  uh fritz spring meyer with the blood lines of the illuminati
[3:15:47.980 --> 3:15:51.420]  although that was taken from me back in 1988
[3:15:51.420 --> 3:15:55.100]  by fritz spring meyer's girlfriend gloria mescarella so
[3:15:55.100 --> 3:15:59.020]  all of these the people that i have you know and of course
[3:15:59.020 --> 3:16:03.740]  i was giving lectures in the motion picture studios and all the different
[3:16:03.740 --> 3:16:08.700]  recording studios back in the 70s and 80s i was uh
[3:16:08.700 --> 3:16:11.820]  going around to motion picture studios at night
[3:16:11.820 --> 3:16:16.060]  and uh just the working class people in the studios would get me a pass
[3:16:16.060 --> 3:16:19.980]  yeah i know uh some say that that they that they took the idea for the matrix
[3:16:19.980 --> 3:16:26.460]  from you is that true well uh i had a video called matrix of power
[3:16:26.460 --> 3:16:29.900]  about 10 years before the movie matrix came out
[3:16:29.900 --> 3:16:34.060]  but i don't think that they now maybe they might have been influenced by the
[3:16:34.060 --> 3:16:37.820]  matrix because it was a big seller when it came out one never
[3:16:37.820 --> 3:16:43.100]  knows but what i do know is that there's that directly from my
[3:16:43.100 --> 3:16:47.180]  video uh with one of my first videos ever done
[3:16:47.180 --> 3:16:51.020]  was called the basic slide presentation and if you get my
[3:16:51.020 --> 3:16:54.620]  basic slide presentation that's the one that may be famous
[3:16:54.620 --> 3:16:59.260]  all over the world and and it was a two hour video
[3:16:59.260 --> 3:17:03.340]  out of that at the very beginning of the basic slide presentation
[3:17:03.340 --> 3:17:07.420]  uh and get that and watch it and then get the movie
[3:17:07.420 --> 3:17:14.380]  da Vinci code and it is exactly word for word exactly in the da Vinci code
[3:17:14.380 --> 3:17:19.100]  at the beginning of the movie they introduce uh tom hanks
[3:17:19.100 --> 3:17:23.260]  as the world of world's foremost researcher and occult societies and
[3:17:23.260 --> 3:17:28.700]  secret societies and uh and and he comes up on the stage
[3:17:28.700 --> 3:17:32.540]  this is in the movie da Vinci code and he comes up on the stage and he's
[3:17:32.540 --> 3:17:37.980]  got a screen and a slide projector and on the screen being projected on the
[3:17:37.980 --> 3:17:40.780]  screen is the uh symbol on the back of the
[3:17:40.780 --> 3:17:44.540]  dollar bill with the pyramid and he walks in front of
[3:17:44.540 --> 3:17:48.540]  the projection so some of it is being projected on him
[3:17:48.540 --> 3:17:52.700]  and he's now pointing to the pyramid the all-seeing eye etc
[3:17:52.700 --> 3:17:56.540]  and talking about the illuminati and secret societies on the dollar bill
[3:17:56.540 --> 3:18:01.260]  etc that came directly out of my basic slide
[3:18:01.260 --> 3:18:06.780]  presentation period period that came directly out of my
[3:18:06.780 --> 3:18:10.300]  video and nobody ever called me to send me a check
[3:18:10.300 --> 3:18:14.300]  da Vinci code of course the whole idea of da Vinci code was a rip-off of
[3:18:14.300 --> 3:18:18.140]  vagantly in lincoln the entire movie da Vinci code
[3:18:18.140 --> 3:18:21.900]  was a absolute rip-off of the british writers
[3:18:21.900 --> 3:18:26.860]  vagantly in lincoln and their book that appeared about 15 years before the
[3:18:26.860 --> 3:18:30.700]  movie called holy blood holy grail and so the
[3:18:30.700 --> 3:18:34.860]  producers of da Vinci code ripped off vagantly and
[3:18:34.860 --> 3:18:39.820]  lincoln's book holy blood holy grail and made it into a
[3:18:39.820 --> 3:18:43.580]  movie and uh and act like they would they came
[3:18:43.580 --> 3:18:47.980]  up with something new and there was a blah suit in england because of that so
[3:18:47.980 --> 3:18:51.580]  i'm not the only one that's been ripped off and lied to and cheated and left for
[3:18:51.580 --> 3:18:54.460]  dead there's a lot of good well it's just you you've

[3:21:28.940 --> 3:21:32.140]  the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years

[3:21:35.260 --> 3:21:37.660]  to produce and it has now finally caught up with this
[3:21:37.660 --> 3:21:41.180]  in the u.s commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed and the
[3:21:41.180 --> 3:21:44.460]  next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months
[3:21:44.460 --> 3:21:47.420]  it's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food
[3:21:47.420 --> 3:21:50.140]  necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain
[3:21:50.140 --> 3:21:53.420]  commodities altogether remember our trade deficit
[3:21:53.420 --> 3:21:56.460]  trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing
[3:21:56.460 --> 3:22:00.620]  in to buy our food production at any price by late summer if not early fall
[3:22:00.620 --> 3:22:03.980]  it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports

[3:24:50.540 --> 3:24:54.060]  uh sometimes that's the best way to start or should we start at the beginning
[3:24:54.060 --> 3:24:57.340]  well i'll tell you what started at the beginning and and let me say this
[3:24:57.340 --> 3:25:01.100]  i don't really want to get into the political
[3:25:01.100 --> 3:25:04.300]  part of this because we don't have a whole lot of time left
[3:25:04.300 --> 3:25:10.700]  uh and besides uh everyone who needs to know already knows how bad off we are
[3:25:10.700 --> 3:25:14.060]  so i'd like to talk about some subjects that maybe we don't know okay but i do
[3:25:14.060 --> 3:25:17.980]  want to get your take on what their final master plan is i mean i don't know
[3:25:17.980 --> 3:25:20.140]  what your view is but but but also i want to get
[3:25:20.140 --> 3:25:24.460]  your latest take your latest analysis on what their in-game is but but but but
[3:25:24.460 --> 3:25:28.140]  sure go ahead and start at the beginning okay well
[3:25:28.140 --> 3:25:31.420]  then everybody should get a piece of paper and pencil and write down a
[3:25:31.420 --> 3:25:36.300]  couple of words i'm going to give you because i believe these are key words
[3:25:36.300 --> 3:25:40.060]  to open up a can of worms that you will not believe
[3:25:40.060 --> 3:25:45.500]  it's going to open up a whole world of research to you that you've never known
[3:25:45.500 --> 3:25:50.540]  existed the first word is hanseatic league
[3:25:50.540 --> 3:25:59.580]  spell h a n s e a t i c hanseatic league it's on my website
[3:25:59.580 --> 3:26:04.140]  if you go to my website and go to the research department it goes to the
[3:26:04.140 --> 3:26:09.100]  research you will see a boxing words to research
[3:26:09.100 --> 3:26:12.940]  go on the words to research and check down into the ages and you'll see
[3:26:12.940 --> 3:26:17.580]  hanseatic league the hanseatic league is extremely
[3:26:17.580 --> 3:26:21.500]  important to the illuminati story today
[3:26:21.500 --> 3:26:25.660]  and connected to the hanseatic league which most people don't even know
[3:26:25.660 --> 3:26:29.660]  exist is something called and write it down
[3:26:29.660 --> 3:26:36.300]  teutonic zionism it is not semenic jewish zionism
[3:26:36.300 --> 3:26:44.940]  no the word is teutonic t e u t o n i c the teutonic knights are the german
[3:26:44.940 --> 3:26:48.460]  branch of the two of the knights Templars that's right
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:52.620]  that's the name of the tune the teutonic zionism
[3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:59.180]  it's a whole secret order that has been in operation for a thousand years
[3:26:59.180 --> 3:27:03.100]  it is the whole story behind america
[3:27:03.100 --> 3:27:07.740]  england and the things which are going on on the earth today and if you don't
[3:27:07.740 --> 3:27:11.580]  understand hanseatic league and teutonic zionism
[3:27:11.580 --> 3:27:15.340]  you're never going to figure out the name of the tune and how this thing is
[3:27:15.340 --> 3:27:18.860]  being played and i've been looking at this for 48
[3:27:18.860 --> 3:27:22.940]  years and i'm telling you that unless and until
[3:27:22.940 --> 3:27:27.180]  you have the whole story you you're not going to get to the bottom of
[3:27:27.180 --> 3:27:30.460]  anything because like i said in the beginning the first hour
[3:27:30.460 --> 3:27:34.380]  your decisions in life are only as good as your information
[3:27:34.380 --> 3:27:39.180]  and the really extraordinary information has never been allowed to be given to
[3:27:39.180 --> 3:27:42.300]  the people so i'm just getting you started into a
[3:27:42.300 --> 3:27:47.340]  truly arcane occult research well on the teutonic knights that really grew into
[3:27:47.340 --> 3:27:50.780]  the Templars and vice versa that's right after they knocked out the Templars
[3:27:50.780 --> 3:27:53.740]  there was still the teutonic knights i only know about the teutonic knights
[3:27:53.740 --> 3:27:57.980]  because i read mine conf i read other books about the nazis
[3:27:57.980 --> 3:28:01.100]  and hitler thought that he was creating the recreated
[3:28:01.100 --> 3:28:04.700]  tune the teutonic knights we know the british follow that
[3:28:04.700 --> 3:28:08.380]  that's right and again this goes back to them believing they're the seed of jesus
[3:28:08.380 --> 3:28:11.900]  they're the god race now you're getting it that's exactly right
[3:28:11.900 --> 3:28:15.980]  and and and and so that's what people can't get why
[3:28:15.980 --> 3:28:20.140]  the political zionist who were supposedly jewish were funding hitler
[3:28:20.140 --> 3:28:24.460]  why uh hitler allowed jews to leave to israel but nowhere else
[3:28:24.460 --> 3:28:29.100]  uh why at the highest levels you'll have zionists right next to top nazis
[3:28:29.100 --> 3:28:31.820]  at bilderberg and it and it's right i've said
[3:28:31.820 --> 3:28:36.860]  when you kick in that final door it's a room full of nazis and cabalist
[3:28:36.860 --> 3:28:40.060]  that's right that's exactly what i'm saying and then
[3:28:40.060 --> 3:28:43.420]  that's what i'm saying you better go back and that's what steven spielberg is
[3:28:43.420 --> 3:28:47.020]  telling us in writers the lost ark he's trying to tell you something
[3:28:47.020 --> 3:28:52.140]  twice the nazis three times the last one the nazis are in it and the in the
[3:28:52.140 --> 3:28:56.140]  first two times the nazis are looking for the lost arc of the covenant
[3:28:56.140 --> 3:29:01.340]  why would the nazis care a day about a jewish symbol of the of the covenant
[3:29:01.340 --> 3:29:06.780]  or the the uh the uh covenant of the the lost arc of the covenant
[3:29:06.780 --> 3:29:11.580]  why would nazis care about the lost arc of the covenant a jewish symbol
[3:29:11.580 --> 3:29:16.620]  why would they uh care about the christian symbol of the holy grail
[3:29:16.620 --> 3:29:23.340]  uh the second one the last crusade why are the why is he putting so much
[3:29:23.340 --> 3:29:26.940]  emphasis on the knights Templars the masonic knights
[3:29:26.940 --> 3:29:33.580]  orders of of the teutonic knights uh they're trying to tell you something
[3:29:33.580 --> 3:29:38.140]  and and so i'm saying i've been looking at this for a long time and i'll tell
[3:29:38.140 --> 3:29:43.900]  you what is what the story is Hanseatic league teutonic
[3:29:43.900 --> 3:29:50.060]  zionism it has nothing to do with jewish zionism out of the bible period
[3:29:50.060 --> 3:29:54.380]  nothing jewish about it it has to do with a very
[3:29:54.380 --> 3:30:01.500]  ancient prehistoric ancient concept of of of a totalitarian dictatorship
[3:30:01.500 --> 3:30:05.020]  as a matter of fact if you go to any good law dictionary
[3:30:05.020 --> 3:30:12.060]  and look up the word fos f-a-s fos fos is a latin word which means god's

[3:37:25.740 --> 3:37:30.860]  he was talking about the teutonic Zionist uh and uh again
[3:37:30.860 --> 3:37:34.940]  separately from jordan maxwell because i've been a big reader
[3:37:34.940 --> 3:37:38.620]  i can confirm what he's saying because i happen to read hind's hobble order the
[3:37:38.620 --> 3:37:42.220]  deathshed uh shears rise and fall the third rike
[3:37:42.220 --> 3:37:46.860]  uh two of hitler's books mind comp and then the new world order
[3:37:46.860 --> 3:37:51.100]  uh i happen to know that they believe the teutonic knights this predates the
[3:37:51.100 --> 3:37:53.900]  Templars mainstream history teaches you the Templars
[3:37:53.900 --> 3:37:58.300]  became the teutonics but really they were the tree from which the
[3:37:58.300 --> 3:38:02.140]  Templars rose and when that tree was cut down and ran to
[3:38:02.140 --> 3:38:05.740]  northern england or to scotland the real heart of it
[3:38:05.740 --> 3:38:08.540]  grew back up and am i correct in saying that jordan
[3:38:08.540 --> 3:38:12.140]  yeah i think you're right i think you're right because the teutonic thing goes
[3:38:12.140 --> 3:38:16.380]  way back into ancient history way back
[3:38:16.380 --> 3:38:21.100]  yes yeah that's a whole study in itself that's why i said
[3:38:21.100 --> 3:38:24.380]  but put the two together the teutonic Zionism
[3:38:24.380 --> 3:38:29.980]  which is Semitic Zionism it's teutonic Zionism and
[3:38:29.980 --> 3:38:36.540]  Hanseatic League and again the word is h a n s e a t i c
[3:38:36.540 --> 3:38:42.220]  Hanseatic League and teutonic Zionism will begin to open up a can of worms
[3:38:42.220 --> 3:38:45.980]  that you're not going to believe what will tell us about the Hanseatic League
[3:38:45.980 --> 3:38:51.900]  well as a as a league of German bankers and thinkers
[3:38:51.900 --> 3:38:55.740]  philosophers but especially bankers and commercial
[3:38:55.740 --> 3:38:59.340]  enterprises in Germany under the second Reich
[3:38:59.340 --> 3:39:03.260]  which was under Kaiser Wilhelm and even way before that
[3:39:03.260 --> 3:39:06.380]  before the German nation came to be a nation
[3:39:06.380 --> 3:39:10.540]  so it's a whole confederation of bankers
[3:39:10.540 --> 3:39:15.500]  thinkers philosophers who were basically they create the modern education
[3:39:15.500 --> 3:39:19.020]  system they created the phd that's it you got it
[3:39:19.020 --> 3:39:23.580]  they engineered the whole society they created nasa they created our cia
[3:39:23.580 --> 3:39:27.020]  they merged with the british german aristocracy
[3:39:27.020 --> 3:39:31.180]  and and and again i'm not absolving the modern corrupt murderous Zionists
[3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:35.420]  the point is i have found that they are actually their play thing
[3:39:35.420 --> 3:39:40.060]  and that they are married in with the Rothschilds and every time i knock down
[3:39:40.060 --> 3:39:43.500]  that final door this is a germanic death cult that
[3:39:43.500 --> 3:39:46.300]  believes they are the true Zionist that's it
[3:39:46.300 --> 3:39:50.300]  that's the name of the tune and you said it all that's it so let's move on because
[3:39:50.300 --> 3:39:54.940]  i mean all i try to do though is report what i really find in history
[3:39:54.940 --> 3:39:58.060]  i know and i mean look at who owns the big pharma companies look at who owns the
[3:39:58.060 --> 3:40:00.780]  military and then and then it's got to be a debate
[3:40:00.780 --> 3:40:04.060]  about the catholics or it's got to be a debate about the but then the catholic
[3:40:04.060 --> 3:40:06.620]  system uh you know is trying to set up the new
[3:40:06.620 --> 3:40:09.660]  roam and it's hooked in with the two tonics is it not
[3:40:09.660 --> 3:40:13.340]  of course it is of course it is but then but then i say it's only
[3:40:13.340 --> 3:40:17.340]  part of it i mean i'm saying Zionist Catholics all of it the Protestants
[3:40:17.340 --> 3:40:20.380]  but see no they want to keep us compartmentalized
[3:40:20.380 --> 3:40:23.500]  divided and conquer don't they you're right you're right
[3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:28.620]  that's why i was saying earlier when you go on my website there are three books
[3:40:28.620 --> 3:40:33.180]  uh that are showing i have other ebooks that uh once you hit one of the uh
[3:40:33.180 --> 3:40:35.660]  books that are showing it will take you to the whole
[3:40:35.660 --> 3:40:40.540]  ebook section but on the one in the middle it's called symbol sex and the
[3:40:40.540 --> 3:40:44.380]  stars which i was so taken by when i first found this
[3:40:44.380 --> 3:40:48.540]  book in an old bookstore i was just absolutely mesmerized by
[3:40:48.540 --> 3:40:55.420]  how much information is in there so well easily to read and explain
[3:40:55.420 --> 3:40:59.420]  about where things come from and the world theology
[3:40:59.420 --> 3:41:03.900]  where it where it developed what the words meant the etymology of the words
[3:41:03.900 --> 3:41:08.460]  and the the where the concepts and ideas have come from it's called symbol
[3:41:08.460 --> 3:41:13.420]  sex and the stars i owned the uh the copyright on that i gave it to
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:18.140]  my friend so he could publish it and then the second one which was so
[3:41:18.140 --> 3:41:24.140]  extraordinarily important i i asked and got the uh copyright
[3:41:24.140 --> 3:41:28.380]  to own it also i not only loved the books i wanted to own them
[3:41:28.380 --> 3:41:32.860]  so i could put them out all over the world it's called stellar theology and
[3:41:32.860 --> 3:41:39.260]  masonic astronomy and once you understand how uh masonic astronomy
[3:41:39.260 --> 3:41:44.700]  and is connected to the stellar theology of the ancient world
[3:41:44.700 --> 3:41:49.180]  then all of the words and terms you're hearing in religion and philosophy and
[3:41:49.180 --> 3:41:53.020]  astronomy all begin to make sense and that's why the olympics this
[3:41:53.020 --> 3:41:56.300]  year are going to be on 888 at 888 in the day
[3:41:56.300 --> 3:42:00.300]  that's why that's why nasa did did the shoots on
[3:42:00.300 --> 3:42:03.900]  on certain days at certain times admittedly occultic
[3:42:03.900 --> 3:42:07.500]  that's why ronald reagan only gave speeches in an exact second
[3:42:07.500 --> 3:42:11.340]  on an exact day with a certain color tie looking a certain direction
[3:42:11.340 --> 3:42:15.180]  and would walk out and hail his arms in an occultic fashion before he did it
[3:42:15.180 --> 3:42:18.540]  that's why bill clinton's upset they really believe this
[3:42:18.540 --> 3:42:21.740]  and they believe that by extension all the power they have they believe it's
[3:42:21.740 --> 3:42:24.620]  real and they believe they're communing with entities don't they
[3:42:24.620 --> 3:42:28.460]  that's exactly right and the mere fact i mean uh you know
[3:42:28.460 --> 3:42:31.820]  by their fruits you shall know them the mere fact that they
[3:42:31.820 --> 3:42:37.340]  are the power tells you that they're very well might be something in fact
[3:42:37.340 --> 3:42:40.940]  legitimate about it that they're very well might be
[3:42:40.940 --> 3:42:46.380]  an occult uh hidden dark force in the universe that we call
[3:42:46.380 --> 3:42:53.660]  the occult magical system that we we put into movies like uh matrix
[3:42:53.660 --> 3:42:59.900]  but there is in point of fact a legitimate de jure real magical system
[3:42:59.900 --> 3:43:04.780]  at op operating on the earth now let's be clear for atheists out there
[3:43:04.780 --> 3:43:08.540]  if you go research your athiatic uh founders
[3:43:08.540 --> 3:43:12.460]  you will find they're funded by occultic and theophics uh you know different
[3:43:12.460 --> 3:43:16.140]  societies and that and that and that the world leaders
[3:43:16.140 --> 3:43:19.420]  who are telling you not to believe anything they are
[3:43:19.420 --> 3:43:24.220]  obsessed with this aren't they absolutely no doubt about it and uh
[3:43:24.220 --> 3:43:27.980]  washington dc is is just filled with occult symbolism
[3:43:27.980 --> 3:43:32.940]  oh it's everywhere everywhere we go to the washington monument
[3:43:32.940 --> 3:43:36.380]  and you know how many people go to the washington monument and see the
[3:43:36.380 --> 3:43:40.860]  washington monument and are and are so proud to stand there and have a
[3:43:40.860 --> 3:43:43.020]  picture taken in the washington monument
[3:43:43.020 --> 3:43:47.740]  never realizing that the washington monument as a phallic symbol for the
[3:43:47.740 --> 3:43:51.100]  phallic of uh the phallic worship in egypt or all these
[3:43:51.100 --> 3:43:54.380]  baptist churches i mean you'll tell a baptist preacher that he'll giggle and
[3:43:54.380 --> 3:43:56.700]  laugh and wink at you because most of them are masons
[3:43:56.700 --> 3:44:00.140]  that's right i mean i mean they know it's it's funny to them
[3:44:00.140 --> 3:44:06.460]  look at i've had so many people uh contact me emails and phone asking me
[3:44:06.460 --> 3:44:09.900]  well what about this and what can you tell me about that well i'm just one
[3:44:09.900 --> 3:44:13.100]  man i can't talk to the whole world one man at a time
[3:44:13.100 --> 3:44:19.100]  but when people call me in and ask me i tell them look at i've found a website
[3:44:19.100 --> 3:44:22.940]  for 15 years i've had stuff on that one subject you just
[3:44:22.940 --> 3:44:28.140]  ask me about and my research uh you know department did you go to
[3:44:28.140 --> 3:44:33.340]  the research boxes uh on my website no well did you go to the links on my
[3:44:33.340 --> 3:44:37.420]  website no did you see the uh the pictures of the
[3:44:37.420 --> 3:44:41.340]  and the downloadable documents no well
[3:44:41.340 --> 3:44:45.260]  did you get any of the ebooks that were there no i didn't see any ebook
[3:44:45.260 --> 3:44:48.540]  so i'm i want to take this opportunity to say
[3:44:48.540 --> 3:44:54.540]  anyone who goes on my website understand there is at least 48 years of
[3:44:54.540 --> 3:44:57.900]  knowledge and work that i have put into my
[3:44:57.900 --> 3:45:01.980]  website of stuff that you will never be privy to know
[3:45:01.980 --> 3:45:06.940]  even exist so when you go to my website don't just look at the home page in a
[3:45:06.940 --> 3:45:10.940]  couple of pictures go all through it and especially on the
[3:45:10.940 --> 3:45:15.340]  audio video page and the links page i've got stuff
[3:45:15.340 --> 3:45:18.780]  on links pages i don't put links on my website
[3:45:18.780 --> 3:45:23.180]  to take up room i i put them on because they are very important to me
[3:45:23.180 --> 3:45:27.660]  now now now jordan i want to move quickly here you also told me privately
[3:45:27.660 --> 3:45:31.900]  that you may not be doing doing radio much longer two sundays from now
[3:45:31.900 --> 3:45:34.860]  you're going to be joining us for the full two hours
[3:45:34.860 --> 3:45:38.700]  uh and if you really are talking about hanging up your hat
[3:45:38.700 --> 3:45:42.060]  uh here i want to get you up even sooner back on this show i mean you say
[3:45:42.060 --> 3:45:45.660]  you're ill you don't feel well you're losing the drive but i hear that drive

[3:45:50.940 --> 3:45:55.340]  i get i get excited in my spirit when i'm in the company of someone like
[3:45:55.340 --> 3:46:00.140]  yourself alex that that that you know that appreciates
[3:46:00.140 --> 3:46:04.780]  uh the work and appreciates the time and the effort and the end and all the
[3:46:04.780 --> 3:46:09.580]  that comes with it because i have become so despondent and so
[3:46:09.580 --> 3:46:15.180]  dejected over all the years of of uh seeing things people are saying
[3:46:15.180 --> 3:46:18.220]  about me which are not true they're saying that i'm an
[3:46:18.220 --> 3:46:21.420]  enemy of so-and-so you shouldn't let them get to you
[3:46:21.420 --> 3:46:24.700]  they're mad but you're you're getting flat because you're over the target
[3:46:24.700 --> 3:46:28.140]  jordan and that people are jealous of you they try to start up fights
[3:46:28.140 --> 3:46:31.260]  just you need to be know you've done a lot of great work you're still doing
[3:46:31.260 --> 3:46:33.580]  great work and if they know they're getting to you
[3:46:33.580 --> 3:46:36.700]  they're only going to go 10 times crazier and look i got people threatening me
[3:46:36.700 --> 3:46:39.500]  and threatening my family and i know it's happened to you and you got people
[3:46:39.500 --> 3:46:42.300]  banging on your doors saying they're going to kill you and the cops won't
[3:46:42.300 --> 3:46:44.780]  help you i understand all that's happening that's why
[3:46:44.780 --> 3:46:48.140]  we've got you here to try to get your support but
[3:46:48.140 --> 3:46:51.340]  don't let them get you down i mean i know you're 70 something years old and got
[3:46:51.340 --> 3:46:55.660]  cancer so it's easy for me you know uh 30 something years younger to consider
[3:46:55.660 --> 3:46:59.180]  and say this but but i mean that's why we got here you got rare books important
[3:46:59.180 --> 3:47:02.380]  material folks go buy us stuff at jordan maxwell.com
[3:47:02.380 --> 3:47:04.780]  jordan i've known him for many years interviewed him many times over the
[3:47:04.780 --> 3:47:08.300]  years never heard him like this i know he's in a bad spot that's why we
[3:47:08.300 --> 3:47:11.740]  are trying to support him here but just from me to you brother
[3:47:11.740 --> 3:47:15.980]  don't let him get you down man you have you have done an incredible job
[3:47:15.980 --> 3:47:21.340]  well i i have i'll tell you what really bothers me terrible i mean i'll just tell
[3:47:21.340 --> 3:47:24.780]  you personally what what really hurts me is the fact that
[3:47:24.780 --> 3:47:29.340]  i haven't even begun to tell the people who want to know
[3:47:29.340 --> 3:47:33.420]  i haven't even begun to scrape the surface of what i know the frustration i have
[3:47:33.420 --> 3:47:36.780]  the same feeling there's 50 films i want to make there's all these complex
[3:47:36.780 --> 3:47:39.660]  issues i want to expose and then i make a film like
[3:47:39.660 --> 3:47:43.340]  endgame that cost me a hundred fifty thousand dollars to make and
[3:47:43.340 --> 3:47:46.620]  people watched it and appreciated it but i know it hasn't gotten the attention
[3:47:46.620 --> 3:47:51.180]  it needs this is life-saving information and and and people just
[3:47:51.180 --> 3:47:54.700]  kind of like oh you put it on the web for free i don't even care to watch it
[3:47:54.700 --> 3:47:57.740]  you know it's like you pour your guts out you don't sleep
[3:47:57.740 --> 3:48:01.420]  making something you go through hell to make it and then understand it's pearls
[3:48:01.420 --> 3:48:04.940]  before swine sometimes absolutely and consequently
[3:48:04.940 --> 3:48:07.580]  but the powers that be know that you're putting it out
[3:48:07.580 --> 3:48:10.940]  and they're going to deal with you you're going to have your family and
[3:48:10.940 --> 3:48:15.020]  threats against your life and threats against your home and you're dealing
[3:48:15.020 --> 3:48:19.340]  you're fighting something on the front lines while other people are just
[3:48:19.340 --> 3:48:24.300]  viewing your work as entertainment so many people will listen to me and
[3:48:24.300 --> 3:48:28.780]  watch videos which i've never put any of my that's right some one of the biggest
[3:48:28.780 --> 3:48:31.100]  comic book companies has put on a whole line
[3:48:31.100 --> 3:48:34.220]  of comic books called new world order and they are giving you credit jordan
[3:48:34.220 --> 3:48:37.980]  you know i know that comic book company did because i think they had to lot
[3:48:37.980 --> 3:48:41.900]  lawfully they had to because it was based on me so
[3:48:41.900 --> 3:48:45.500]  but you know if you go on my website to the uh...
[3:48:45.500 --> 3:48:49.420]  to the e-books those three e-books are very very important that's why i put
[3:48:49.420 --> 3:48:52.780]  them on the home page and of course i have another box called
[3:48:52.780 --> 3:48:56.620]  endorsements and emails a lot of interesting stuff on there
[3:48:56.620 --> 3:49:01.260]  that people have sent me and i just put it out in the public so let you see
[3:49:01.260 --> 3:49:05.660]  what other people have sent me then downloadable documents
[3:49:05.660 --> 3:49:10.380]  uh... the photo gallery and of course just general research boxes i've got
[3:49:10.380 --> 3:49:13.500]  tons of stuff on there but what really bothers me
[3:49:13.500 --> 3:49:18.060]  is that i would love to be able to do radio and talk to the world
[3:49:18.060 --> 3:49:23.420]  and tell the world what i really know why don't we have you back up why don't
[3:49:23.420 --> 3:49:27.660]  we have you back up later in the week uh... for like two hours to really know
[3:49:27.660 --> 3:49:30.700]  but you can say whatever you want here jordan and it's a big audience
[3:49:30.700 --> 3:49:33.660]  i mean millions of people as you know but but before we go to this this final
[3:49:33.660 --> 3:49:35.500]  break for the main show and then call you back
[3:49:35.500 --> 3:49:39.980]  on my studio line for an internet cast with millions will see it in the next
[3:49:39.980 --> 3:49:42.060]  few months but tens of thousands listening
[3:49:42.060 --> 3:49:46.460]  and watching right now uh... but but but i want to have about two things before
[3:49:46.460 --> 3:49:49.020]  this main show ends in about eight minutes
[3:49:49.020 --> 3:49:54.700]  and that is this uh... a how does their command and control structure work and
[3:49:54.700 --> 3:49:58.460]  we know it's a philosophy it's a pyramid it's different lower levels of
[3:49:58.460 --> 3:50:01.740]  compartmentalization a but i mean you know from a city
[3:50:01.740 --> 3:50:05.100]  up to the national level international and then b
[3:50:05.100 --> 3:50:09.100]  their master plan if they're able to get everything they want built and done
[3:50:09.100 --> 3:50:12.860]  which it looks like they're able to do what will it finally look like when will
[3:50:12.860 --> 3:50:16.620]  they go ahead and wipe out ninety percent of us or what's the time frame on that
[3:50:16.620 --> 3:50:19.980]  effect let's cover that first we're gonna skip this break for info wars dot
[3:50:19.980 --> 3:50:22.940]  com listeners okay well you want to talk about it
[3:50:22.940 --> 3:50:27.900]  yeah yeah yeah let's talk about their master plan if they win
[3:50:27.900 --> 3:50:32.220]  well i think the human race and this is going to be painting with a very broad
[3:50:32.220 --> 3:50:36.540]  brush but it's based on many years of looking at the subject
[3:50:36.540 --> 3:50:41.100]  from every conceivable angle and i've traveled all around the world from
