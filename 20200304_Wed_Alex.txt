[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  Well, Super Thursday came and went.
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.240]  On a Tuesday, and the man that dubbed it Super Thursday,
[00:35.240 --> 00:38.680]  the new dubbed his life as sister last night,
[00:38.680 --> 00:41.800]  who can't string a sentence together now.
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.560]  Joe Biden won in the majority of the states
[00:46.560 --> 00:47.800]  on Super Tuesday.
[00:47.800 --> 00:52.880]  He is the front runner in pole position.
[00:52.880 --> 00:58.080]  Right behind him is the communist, Bernie Tunders,
[00:58.080 --> 01:00.520]  who can string sentences together.
[01:00.520 --> 01:02.120]  Lots of promises of goodies.
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.800]  And Fredy's he's going to give you.
[01:04.800 --> 01:10.200]  This is beyond a Kurt Vonnegut satire novel.
[01:10.200 --> 01:13.720]  This is unbelievable.
[01:13.720 --> 01:17.320]  But Hillary is still fluttering around like a vampire bat,
[01:17.320 --> 01:19.240]  hoping for a broker convention.
[01:19.240 --> 01:22.520]  And with the Democrat convention,
[01:22.520 --> 01:25.040]  four months away or more?
[01:25.040 --> 01:28.240]  Man, I don't see how Biden makes it show.
[01:28.240 --> 01:29.800]  We're going to cover it all today.
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.400]  Unbelievably important coronavirus developments
[01:32.400 --> 01:35.920]  under cover video being leaked out of Iran and other places
[01:35.920 --> 01:38.920]  of just piles of body bags and dead people
[01:38.920 --> 01:40.320]  and all that's coming up next segment.
[01:40.320 --> 01:46.960]  But I want to go back here today and look at Mike Bloomberg
[01:46.960 --> 01:49.080]  that dropped out this morning.
[01:49.080 --> 01:51.400]  Because he hired a bunch of PR firms
[01:51.400 --> 01:54.160]  that were going to teach him how to meme.
[01:54.160 --> 01:57.320]  And it was like space aliens from Mars
[01:57.320 --> 02:01.280]  or another dimension trying to learn human humor.
[02:01.280 --> 02:02.880]  He shakes dog's faces.
[02:02.880 --> 02:06.160]  He licks his fingers and touches communal food.
[02:06.160 --> 02:09.760]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[02:09.760 --> 02:12.680]  He dresses up like a little mermaid.
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.840]  He dresses up like Mary Poppins.
[02:14.840 --> 02:17.600]  He thinks that's going to get inside Trump's head.
[02:21.680 --> 02:24.000]  I actually think Mike Bloomberg might actually
[02:24.000 --> 02:24.960]  be a space alien.
[02:24.960 --> 02:27.560]  I never used to believe the David Ike stuff about reptoids.
[02:27.560 --> 02:28.600]  But you know what?
[02:28.600 --> 02:30.160]  You watch this enhanced footage.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.880]  We blew this footage up of him.
[02:32.880 --> 02:33.880]  Trump said, what are you doing?
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.040]  He's licking his fingers, disgustingly,
[02:37.040 --> 02:40.320]  and then touching the big serving dishes.
[02:40.320 --> 02:42.400]  I mean, I don't slap my kids for much,
[02:42.400 --> 02:45.080]  but they get a little bit of a slap on the back of the head
[02:45.080 --> 02:46.080]  for that, man.
[02:46.080 --> 02:47.480]  That's how you get food poisoning.
[02:47.480 --> 02:48.480]  And I'm not even a germaphobe.
[02:48.480 --> 02:51.640]  But keep your freaking fingers out of the serving dishes
[02:51.640 --> 02:54.920]  and certainly don't lick them.
[02:54.920 --> 02:57.680]  Basic etiquette of this guy that wants to be the nanny
[02:57.680 --> 02:59.840]  and tell us how we should live and what we should do.
[02:59.840 --> 03:02.240]  But again, he's totally psychotic.
[03:02.240 --> 03:02.740]  Here he is.
[03:06.440 --> 03:07.480]  Enhanced audio, folks.
[03:10.600 --> 03:11.600]  We turned this up.
[03:11.600 --> 03:12.200]  It's cranked up.
[03:12.200 --> 03:13.200]  This is what happened.
[03:13.200 --> 03:16.200]  Disgusting.
[03:16.200 --> 03:24.200]  Disgusting.
[03:24.200 --> 03:28.200]  This is absolutely gross.
[03:28.200 --> 03:33.200]  That boy is a PIG pig.
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.200]  Mini Mike.
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.200]  No, Mike didn't do too well.
[03:38.200 --> 03:39.200]  He went way down.
[03:39.200 --> 03:48.760]  So he might have gotten in with the financial mafia and come up with a scam to rip off money
[03:48.760 --> 03:55.720]  in the markets, but he always will be a hunchback little nobody know him, okay, he'll burn
[03:55.720 --> 04:05.920]  in hell because everybody looks at that phony pile of dog manure and knows that he will
[04:05.920 --> 04:06.920]  burn in hell.
[04:06.920 --> 04:10.360]  So he's the guy who financed the lawsuits against us, which makes me feel great.
[04:10.360 --> 04:17.640]  When a pile of dog feces like that doesn't like me, it means I'm doing really good.
[04:17.640 --> 04:21.880]  So bring it on, you demon midget.
[04:21.880 --> 04:25.600]  By the way, there's nothing against short people, hell, I'm not that great in stature.
[04:25.600 --> 04:30.640]  But I mean, it's just, he thinks he's so big and so powerful, he definitely has a Napoleonic
[04:30.640 --> 04:31.640]  syndrome.
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.120]  I mean, you know, I'm 5'11 when I stand up straight, he's at least 4'9 when he stands
[04:35.120 --> 04:36.120]  up straight.
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.320]  And boy, let me tell you, that really sold the public all that sashing around.
[04:40.320 --> 04:45.440]  When I'm not saying my Bloomberg's gay or anything, I'm just saying I was going to cast
[04:45.440 --> 04:50.880]  somebody for a gay gang bang video, he definitely be the main subject of the deposits that we're
[04:50.880 --> 04:51.880]  going to be made.
[04:51.880 --> 05:20.840]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[05:20.840 --> 05:49.240]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[05:49.240 --> 06:15.800]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[06:15.800 --> 06:41.280]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[06:41.280 --> 07:11.080]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[07:11.080 --> 07:40.600]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[07:40.600 --> 08:09.760]  We'll be right back.
[08:10.760 --> 08:40.520]  We'll be right back.
[08:40.520 --> 08:44.280]  We're going to play some of his gaffes coming up a little bit later, there's so many every
[08:44.280 --> 08:45.280]  day.
[08:45.280 --> 08:52.320]  We're not having to like cherry pick this, you just watch a speech and he sounds like
[08:52.320 --> 08:58.280]  he has sniffed glue, drunk a bottle of Jack Daniels in the last hour and put about 14
[08:58.280 --> 09:01.640]  large marbles, log rollers in his mouth.
[09:01.640 --> 09:06.760]  I mean, I can't tell what the hell he's saying, he's twisting everything around and you know,
[09:06.760 --> 09:07.760]  it's very sad.
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.560]  I'm not actually making fun of him because my grandfather, my mom's dad was a super
[09:12.560 --> 09:14.320]  smart guy and awesome.
[09:14.320 --> 09:17.960]  He had a heart attack, then he had a stroke and man, some days you'd go over there, it
[09:17.960 --> 09:19.680]  was like a five year old was there.
[09:19.680 --> 09:22.840]  Other days he'd kind of be back for a while, but there were some days where things weren't
[09:22.840 --> 09:25.240]  too good and he sounded like Joe Biden.
[09:25.240 --> 09:29.200]  You'd sit there at the dinner table with him while, you know, he was drooling from the
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.560]  stroke with hapus paralyzed and he'd be like, well, I'm bad, he'd get excited and say some
[09:34.560 --> 09:35.560]  stuff.
[09:35.560 --> 09:38.440]  And you know, a few things scare me, but that scares me being like that some big as I'm
[09:38.440 --> 09:39.440]  like a carbon copy.
[09:39.440 --> 09:43.280]  I look just like him and it scares the hell out of me because I don't want to be in that
[09:43.280 --> 09:44.280]  position.
[09:44.280 --> 09:47.240]  I've never been for assisted suicide, but I don't want the state doing it.
[09:47.240 --> 09:51.960]  But let me tell you, I get in that position, family needs to take care of it.
[09:51.960 --> 09:57.880]  So it's horrifying to watch and that's really the big discussion here in my view.
[09:57.880 --> 10:10.280]  What is going on with the Democrats and the media that they would
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.320]  force feed us somebody member eight months ago, I got banned on Facebook for the second
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.320]  time.
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.320]  They said, you can't even say positive things about Alex Jones, only negative comments are
[10:20.320 --> 10:21.320]  allowed.
[10:21.320 --> 10:23.320]  Talk about living in a cult.
[10:23.320 --> 10:30.960]  Where's Jim Jones when you name or the hell bop people?
[10:30.960 --> 10:32.840]  And all I said is he's clearly had another stroke.
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.680]  He's had major brain surgeries.
[10:34.680 --> 10:35.760]  He can't talk.
[10:35.760 --> 10:37.200]  He's way worse now.
[10:37.200 --> 10:41.840]  And they said, Jones put out fake news that Biden can't talk properly.
[10:41.840 --> 10:46.080]  Well, that's all subjective, but political fact was like, he talks wonderfully.
[10:46.080 --> 10:47.600]  He's an incredible lawyer.
[10:47.600 --> 10:54.520]  They literally thought Joe Biden, eight months ago, who could not string a sentence together
[10:54.520 --> 11:04.560]  properly and who had gas every minute or so was their horse.
[11:04.560 --> 11:07.240]  Now everything he says is a gas.
[11:07.240 --> 11:14.160]  It's unintelligible, but that's not the issue.
[11:14.160 --> 11:18.760]  It's not that Joe Biden's almost 80 and had a brain surgery, he almost died of 20 something
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.720]  years ago and admits it where they take the whole brain out, they had to fix the vessels
[11:23.720 --> 11:24.720]  under it.
[11:24.720 --> 11:25.800]  I mean, usually don't make it back from that.
[11:25.800 --> 11:27.400]  He's definitely a tough guy.
[11:27.400 --> 11:29.360]  The point is his expiration date is up.
[11:29.360 --> 11:35.040]  It's like you open some milk, go, whoa, that stinks, you need to taste it to know it.
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.280]  And then weird, like, and that's the weird thing about dementia is it's like really weird
[11:39.280 --> 11:45.560]  stuff gets said that makes those things like black kids like flies, like flyers, they touch
[11:45.560 --> 11:51.880]  my hair, but Joe, I'm gonna kiss this baby, I mean, I can't love on him, I mean, oh,
[11:51.880 --> 11:52.880]  what's that?
[11:52.880 --> 11:56.480]  Oh, I'm gonna ride on the wall of my, with my Crayola, they're like, that's not your
[11:56.480 --> 11:57.480]  Crayola.
[11:57.480 --> 12:01.040]  I mean, that's, that's the crazy part about this is he is munched away.
[12:01.040 --> 12:06.240]  I don't say this be sarcastic from riding on the walls in his own feces.
[12:06.240 --> 12:09.960]  He's just grabbing women's crotches, grabbing women, making them sit on his lap, husbands
[12:09.960 --> 12:10.960]  are getting pissed.
[12:10.960 --> 12:13.680]  He's telling nine year old girls, you make me horny.
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.160]  I mean, this is all on tape.
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.320]  Chris Matthews has to resign because he told a guest, you look beautiful, but Joe Biden
[12:23.320 --> 12:30.440]  can run around like a dementia-ridden, dirty old man running on two cylinders at a smoke
[12:30.440 --> 12:32.720]  coming out, black smoke, fire coming out of it.
[12:32.720 --> 12:35.520]  I mean, this, he is beyond a dumpster fire.
[12:35.520 --> 12:38.840]  He's like a car on fire.
[12:38.840 --> 12:51.200]  And so the issue is, in what dimension, in what planet is this the Democrat whole position
[12:51.200 --> 12:52.680]  nominee individual?
[12:52.680 --> 12:54.880]  And what are they planning with Hillary?
[12:54.880 --> 12:59.840]  And what are they planning to do coming up?
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.080]  What is their game plan?
[13:01.080 --> 13:03.240]  Because they've got to trick up their sleeve.
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.120]  There's no way they think this guy, when I said it eight months ago, they knew the guy
[13:07.120 --> 13:08.120]  couldn't talk.
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.720]  That's why Obama wouldn't endorse it.
[13:10.720 --> 13:16.320]  Well, eight months later, this dude is, I mean, you go to a nursing home and you're
[13:16.320 --> 13:19.800]  not going to have dinner with grandparents and all of it almost every week when I have
[13:19.800 --> 13:22.120]  time, usually about once a month.
[13:22.120 --> 13:26.640]  And I have Weldon Henson and folks go, we don't play for grandparents at the, some of
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.040]  my friends, they're country music folks would go play for folks, the old folks, you know,
[13:30.040 --> 13:34.240]  I'd have conversations with these veterans and patriots, you name it, and most of them
[13:34.240 --> 13:35.240]  were there.
[13:35.240 --> 13:38.920]  They kind of drift in and out, but they'd say some really important things.
[13:38.920 --> 13:42.080]  Joe Biden is in the lower percentile.
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.920]  Let's say, can't talk is a one and a well-spoken old 80-something-year-old person in a nursing
[13:47.920 --> 13:49.280]  home is a 10.
[13:49.280 --> 13:51.840]  Joe Biden's like a three, folks.
[13:51.840 --> 13:59.280]  The Democrat party person, their force feeding and making us take is literally physically
[13:59.280 --> 14:09.080]  able to walk around and has a lot of energy, but the brain isn't operating.
[14:09.080 --> 14:11.800]  So I'll ask the question, what are they up to?
[14:11.800 --> 14:13.240]  There's another way to say it.
[14:13.240 --> 14:15.680]  What the hell are they doing?
[14:15.680 --> 14:18.920]  There is something going on here and it's in the news that Hillary's still waiting in
[14:18.920 --> 14:19.920]  the wings.
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.600]  So maybe Biden has another stroke or he has to step down and what do they do?
[14:23.600 --> 14:27.880]  And well, she's still polling right behind Biden, better than Bernie in most polls.
[14:27.880 --> 14:33.240]  They've got it all ready and she still believes she's going to swoop in and do this.
[14:33.240 --> 14:34.840]  And a lot of other experts are saying that's going to happen.
[14:34.840 --> 14:36.240]  I'm not saying it's going to happen.
[14:36.240 --> 14:41.200]  I'm just saying they never give up and she's always intended to run again and never stop
[14:41.200 --> 14:42.200]  running basically.
[14:42.200 --> 14:45.480]  So we'll discuss all that.
[14:45.480 --> 14:51.880]  We've got the worst coronavirus news yet and I'm not holding back getting into it.
[14:51.880 --> 14:56.080]  It's just, it's so crazy that it makes my head spin.
[14:56.080 --> 14:57.920]  Time to debunk the skeptics.
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.680]  Coronavirus is 19 or coronavirus 19 has a death rate that is about 34 times higher than
[15:02.680 --> 15:03.680]  the flu.
[15:03.680 --> 15:13.920]  BBC publishes leaked Iran footage showing bagged bodies of coronavirus victims piling up China
[15:13.920 --> 15:17.480]  supply chain meltdown set to rock US ports.
[15:17.480 --> 15:19.760]  Yeah, that's that's what's definitely real.
[15:19.760 --> 15:22.040]  Italy closes all schools have been coronavirus outbreak.
[15:22.040 --> 15:25.840]  That is just some of what we're going to cover when we get back.
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.800]  Please remember the only way this transmission gets down the local AM and FM stations and
[15:29.800 --> 15:33.280]  the Internet is you tell people about those local stations to please remember we're in

[16:04.800 --> 16:08.880]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since I wrote the book on tax debt
[16:08.880 --> 16:12.440]  settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never

[19:19.920 --> 19:23.840]  and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.000]  free I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.600]  I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[19:33.600 --> 19:39.160]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels
[19:39.160 --> 19:45.200]  like good things are happening in my mouth in fact I find myself brushing my teeth three
[19:45.200 --> 20:01.600]  to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels
[20:01.600 --> 20:21.360]  we're listening to the alex jones show leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world

[20:56.400 --> 21:01.040]  the fourth hour and then you got the war room with oan shroyer and all the great things
[21:01.040 --> 21:11.160]  they're doing in the fight for freedom and ignite the brush fires in humanity i want
[21:11.160 --> 21:16.920]  to get into corona virus in the next segment right now i want to continue along the theme
[21:16.920 --> 21:29.240]  that i was kidding it's frightening to me that the democrat field run from people like
[21:29.240 --> 21:33.080]  tulsi gabard's who i don't agree with a lot of stuff but she's well spoken and looks
[21:33.080 --> 21:37.480]  like a human and has some humanity and is in his establishment who they've shut out
[21:37.480 --> 21:43.040]  because she acts like a human and then you got elizabeth warren looks like a atomatronic
[21:43.040 --> 21:49.080]  robot at chuckie cheese that's what the system tried to force for you this she's super unpopular
[21:49.080 --> 21:54.680]  and then it goes through bloomberg the billionaire coming in trying to take over because he got
[21:54.680 --> 22:00.360]  a bunch of experts to lie to him to get his money hit when he had no chance no star appeal
[22:00.360 --> 22:06.080]  no nothing and then you've got a communist lying to people who's a con man whose dad
[22:06.080 --> 22:11.240]  was a criminal con man telling you have all this free stuff running around flying on private
[22:11.240 --> 22:16.800]  jet saying nobody else should and owning three one million plus dollar arms and then you've
[22:16.800 --> 22:25.720]  got byton who there's an article here elites preparing to live forever with their brains
[22:25.720 --> 22:33.720]  inside robot bodies super rich to live forever by planning brains in human like robots well
[22:33.720 --> 22:37.640]  that's the daily star well if your brains rotten it doesn't matter what you've got a
[22:37.640 --> 22:46.720]  rotting dementia brain inside a robot I mean it's ridiculous folks the delusions no none
[22:46.720 --> 22:52.920]  of these people are going to cheat death they're going to face the creator but if you want to
[22:52.920 --> 22:58.640]  know what's happening if you go to a democrat rally all of us are getting soft all of us
[22:58.640 --> 23:02.600]  are getting decadent none of us know how to do math anymore the whole world dehumanizes
[23:02.600 --> 23:08.720]  us technology seems great but it is weakening us it is making us ancestors whether you're
[23:08.720 --> 23:11.880]  in africa or europe or anywhere ten thousand years ago they dig up the bodies they dig
[23:11.880 --> 23:19.880]  up the skeletons they were the average person was twice as strong as someone today and stronger
[23:19.880 --> 23:28.240]  than an olympic athlete a woman average woman they dig up from ten thousand years ago and
[23:28.240 --> 23:36.720]  what's england today is is is stronger than an olympic athlete who's a man you can pull
[23:36.720 --> 23:44.400]  that up they've got the studies the bones all of it I mean chimpanzees can rip a person's
[23:44.400 --> 23:53.400]  face off no problem what person do you know today that can rip somebody's face off the
[23:53.400 --> 23:59.420]  point is is that that's just the physical power what about the mental power our mental
[23:59.420 --> 24:06.800]  power is going down to we're dying and I've used the analogy of a mars mission would
[24:06.800 --> 24:13.160]  take almost a year to get there and most even best astronauts in great shape would be unable
[24:13.160 --> 24:18.480]  to walk once they got there because there's no gravity so your body falls apart and that's
[24:18.480 --> 24:23.960]  what technologies like is it's it's like not having gravity and so we're just falling
[24:23.960 --> 24:31.960]  apart yeah disease doesn't kill the weak anymore but it just lets the weak produce and that
[24:31.960 --> 24:37.200]  comes into eugenics the globalists are actually targeting the strong the opposite of eugenics
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.400]  so they say they're eugenics but they're not even eugenics even though eugenics systems
[24:41.400 --> 24:45.880]  and malthusian systems are bad enough there's something even worse that's targeting their
[24:45.880 --> 24:50.680]  competition because the globalists are already so inbred and so screwed up they want to lower
[24:50.680 --> 24:57.720]  all of us to their level and so that's really the big secret is they're doing everything
[24:57.720 --> 25:02.960]  they can to bring down humanity but it's the helter skelter song I'm coming down fast but
[25:02.960 --> 25:11.200]  a miles above you Bloomberg so when you see all these weak dumb people resonating and
[25:11.200 --> 25:17.000]  then their leaders are weak and dumb that's a manifestation of like those would like birds
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.280]  of a feather fly together and so you go to a burning rally or a sanders rally it looks
[25:23.280 --> 25:28.440]  like they could be black white old young they people look like they're half dead they could
[25:28.440 --> 25:34.680]  be 20 years old or 70 years old and they're sputtering and got green teeth and you'll
[25:34.680 --> 25:38.880]  see weird politicals handling them and managing them but then their own leaders are like hunchback
[25:38.880 --> 25:45.400]  demons like Hillary cackling like witches and it's been our tolerance of their evil
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.880]  has allowed it to grow into this and now they think that's the norm and they see those of
[25:49.880 --> 25:54.400]  us that have brains here's the allegory why the zombies want brains because they don't
[25:54.400 --> 26:04.240]  have it why the moths go to the flame they don't have the light folks and they're not
[26:04.240 --> 26:10.080]  going to stop till those of us that still have it are destroyed so what we can do about
[26:10.080 --> 26:14.480]  that's a big long discussion we're going to have but gloves got to come off games got
[26:14.480 --> 26:20.120]  to stop here let's let's go out to break with a little compilation of Bloomberg and Trump
[26:20.120 --> 26:24.920]  tweeted what are you doing there's food he's sticking his hands in communal serving dishes
[26:24.920 --> 26:30.920]  licking it and going back into it he's shaking dogs faces he's he's saying because the dude
[26:30.920 --> 26:37.480]  is a psychotic he's in a psychotic guild disconnected from us lower than us but because he'll do
[26:37.480 --> 26:41.320]  bad things he's on top like cancer you think a cancer cell is better than your whole body
[26:41.320 --> 26:46.160]  in your brain no it's pathetic but it will now function and replicate so it's dominant
[26:46.160 --> 26:52.920]  you see and Mike Bloomberg is a cancer cell an incompetent fraud but he's taken over he
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.920]  thinks he's the boss so here he is licking his fingers and sticking in communal food
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.920]  is an act of disrespect here he is
[27:15.920 --> 27:21.680]  literally sticks his fingers in the communal food and licks it just it's all part of this
[27:21.680 --> 27:28.680]  vomitous demon this is our goblinies this is absolutely gross that boy is a PIG pig
[27:35.720 --> 27:42.680]  mini Mike now Mike didn't do too well he went way down trouble a very run-taking

[27:51.680 --> 27:58.680]  we got heroes everywhere dressing up on off-broadway shows as Murray Pappas then New Hampshire maybe
[27:58.680 --> 28:16.680]  I can get the whole country to behave he thought that was so I mean talk about a lunatic Mike

[31:09.680 --> 31:13.680]  of their health take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality
[31:13.680 --> 31:18.680]  and I say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are being offered

[31:23.680 --> 31:29.680]  1pm power pack well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular
[31:29.680 --> 31:33.680]  customer in that regard I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important
[31:33.680 --> 31:38.680]  to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to
[31:38.680 --> 31:43.680]  think about these great events in the world one of the priorities has to be to take care of
[31:43.680 --> 31:50.680]  yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good
[31:50.680 --> 31:55.680]  purpose for our families and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think
[31:55.680 --> 32:00.680]  like we do are critical to the future of America you want to break some globalist ribs you
[32:00.680 --> 32:05.680]  want to crush some skulls politically you want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs
[32:05.680 --> 32:09.680]  spiritually there's no where you can spend money there's no where you can place your
[32:09.680 --> 32:16.680]  back in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar your bang for your buck

[32:23.680 --> 32:27.680]  of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy and so it's very simple if you don't
[32:27.680 --> 32:32.680]  want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which God wants to see
[32:32.680 --> 32:38.680]  we have to make the effort 110% God will finish the move and I know I need to stay in the
[32:38.680 --> 32:43.680]  fight in the attack attack attack I want to attack I want to go after the globalist and
[32:43.680 --> 32:46.680]  believe me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family
[32:46.680 --> 32:50.680]  to fight for all of our futures together you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game I'm
[32:50.680 --> 32:54.680]  going to bust my ass with everything I've got for us for myself and my family for your
[32:54.680 --> 33:18.680]  family because we're in this together info or store dot com you're listening to the Alex Jones show

[33:27.680 --> 33:43.680]  from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:43.680 --> 33:51.680]  so if you're going to have some chili con queso you call it here in Texas or nacho cheese
[33:51.680 --> 33:57.680]  you take each chip and you load it up with guacamole or salsa or whatever you want and
[33:57.680 --> 34:04.680]  then you just dip a little bit into the cheese and then you eat it as one bite but you don't
[34:04.680 --> 34:10.680]  bite it off and then stick it back in because that's your saliva in the dish and my middle
[34:10.680 --> 34:15.680]  family is awesome but we had queso from the restaurant that I picked up coming home we
[34:15.680 --> 34:19.680]  got the big serving dish and I tell her to ladle it out on your plate or dip it in and
[34:19.680 --> 34:23.680]  she still stuck the chip in last week after she bit us and let me teach you a lesson it's
[34:23.680 --> 34:29.680]  going in the trash and everybody got really upset I said sorry okay so I've told you 100
[34:29.680 --> 34:35.680]  times do not stick and I'm not even a germaphobe it's just normal like wash your hands when

[34:43.680 --> 34:46.680]  remember a few months ago they started censoring his tweets and people said oh they would never
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.680]  do that they went yeah we did they are disappearing his tweets we'll play that clip one more time

[36:08.680 --> 36:13.680]  you know of what you find in a nursing home it's very sad but what does that tell you
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.680]  about the Democrats and the globalist they are the party of death the party of decay
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.680]  the party of delusion I mean my god they're endorsed pedophilia now I mean these people
[36:23.680 --> 36:28.680]  are open borders world government socialism communism the public pooping up the needles
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.680]  everywhere I mean they're they're demons let's watch a demon eat if you're ready to listen

[36:37.680 --> 37:00.680]  this we've turned the sound up here it is here's Bloomberg
[37:00.680 --> 37:14.680]  disturbing
[37:14.680 --> 37:23.680]  this is absolutely gross that boy is a PIG pig mini Mike now Mike didn't do too well
[37:23.680 --> 37:30.680]  he went way down so don't invite many Mike over to dinner he'll shake your dog's face
[37:30.680 --> 37:36.680]  you'll tell you how to live and then he'll stick his fingers in bowls of food and start
[37:36.680 --> 37:40.680]  licking him and stick them back in like he's an alien like your planet serves us well I
[37:40.680 --> 37:49.680]  mean if I if I made cone heads too I would this was like alien had a buffet man your
[37:49.680 --> 37:56.680]  troughs of swarping is delicious here let me stick my fingers in it all right I've got
[37:56.680 --> 38:03.680]  so much huge mass of news and a bunch of big guests and I have really just I don't want
[38:03.680 --> 38:15.680]  to say I've spun my wheels the first 37 minutes but you know the bubble of death or whatever
[38:15.680 --> 38:20.680]  on the Apple computer or when my computer's thinking we know Hillary still got a plan
[38:20.680 --> 38:27.680]  to run why would they have Joe Biden who obviously has late stage dementia he's French kissing
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.680]  little kids on screen grabbing women's butts just doesn't know what day things are just
[38:32.680 --> 38:41.680]  totally insane that's beyond clown world so what is that who's running things you look
[38:41.680 --> 38:56.680]  at Trump man he's got his act together he's on target it's like night and day so then
[38:56.680 --> 39:02.680]  I ask why didn't Trump stop in the censorship and the authoritarianism on the left was he
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.680]  putting up with that because he could beat these people very quickly and we need to get
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.680]  rid of them we need to like just recognize they're like cancer cut it out we're done have
[39:12.680 --> 39:17.680]  two parties that's great these people ain't it MS 13's God's children no borders no walls
[39:17.680 --> 39:23.680]  no USA at all when your party says the country shouldn't exist you you aren't a party in
[39:23.680 --> 39:28.680]  that country it's real simple I mean that's just default not debatable everybody knows
[39:28.680 --> 39:34.680]  that so I don't think Trump's a Psyop I know he's an organic response to what's going on
[39:34.680 --> 39:38.680]  and good people waking up taking action I know he wouldn't have gotten elected if this audience
[39:38.680 --> 39:44.680]  hadn't taken action and gotten him in there but and he's doing a kick butt job so good
[39:44.680 --> 40:01.680]  on other fronts that I smell a rat and I'm not saying Trump's a rat but to allow the
[40:01.680 --> 40:12.680]  Democrats to continue to operate around like penguins on PCP attacking everybody it's a
[40:12.680 --> 40:16.680]  dereliction of duty to put up with this and yeah we're cleaning their clocks we're kicking
[40:16.680 --> 40:21.680]  their ass all that it still doesn't matter just because there's a rabid dog a rabid pit bull
[40:21.680 --> 40:27.680]  or German shepherd or body be a chihuahua foaming at the mouth you call animal control or you
[40:27.680 --> 40:31.680]  shoot at yourself before it bites somebody you're like well it's just foaming at the mouth
[40:31.680 --> 40:38.680]  and bumping into things yeah and if it gets near a person it's gonna bite him and give him rabies
[40:38.680 --> 40:48.680]  and the Democrats are like a horde of foaming at the mouth wild hyenas rabid and I personally
[40:48.680 --> 40:58.680]  am tired of it you know what's the grocery store last night my daughter wanted cool whip
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.680]  she was like oh it's bad for me daddy but one of my daughters I really want cool whip
[41:01.680 --> 41:05.680]  and toggle chip ice cream and I said okay got in the car about seven o'clock drove the
[41:05.680 --> 41:13.680]  HEB and I go in there man and man the people were hateful and pissed and acting all creepy
[41:13.680 --> 41:19.680]  and weird and being real passive aggressive and I said well I'll just do it to me because
[41:19.680 --> 41:25.680]  I watched them do it to each other and it's because things have been so easy so long and
[41:25.680 --> 41:33.680]  they've gotten disconnected from reality they need to go take a bike ride they need to go
[41:33.680 --> 41:38.680]  lift weights they need to go to church they need to go help with the Salvation Army they
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.680]  just need to get outside of the bubble because I mean I'm not thinking of myself as like some
[41:43.680 --> 41:48.680]  Superman far from it but I was looking at black people white people Hispanics and they just
[41:48.680 --> 41:56.680]  all look dead eyed kind of like pears and we're really fat and real angry and I was smiling
[41:56.680 --> 42:08.680]  out folks and I'm gonna try to and you just they was a wall of their souls aren't gone
[42:08.680 --> 42:15.680]  but they're in suspended animation or in carbonite they they've been put in a trance
[42:15.680 --> 42:19.680]  and they've been put in a workplace and they think they're don't have any power and they
[42:19.680 --> 42:24.680]  think they're desperate and they don't have a reason to live and so they're just stewing
[42:24.680 --> 42:28.680]  in self-loathing instead of a connection to God connection to beauty if they could just
[42:28.680 --> 42:36.680]  recognize beauty and and a painting or knitting or or helping somebody or gardening then they
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.680]  would connect to the earth but because they're all smartphones everything else they're just
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.680]  dying it's scary and and what I saw there's what I see in a Bernie Sanders event then
[42:45.680 --> 42:49.680]  I go to some rural town three white people Hispanics over there they're all alive and
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.680]  happy because they're working and they're alive and they're they're doing something
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.680]  it's modern civilization that's killing us rich in Alabama rich thanks for calling
[42:59.680 --> 43:05.680]  hey mr. Jones appreciate it first thing I love the turbo force I drive truck for a living
[43:05.680 --> 43:10.680]  and it's amazing coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end but that

[43:19.680 --> 43:23.680]  sustainable anywhere from 18 hours I don't feel the jitters like I do drink and coffee and it's
[43:23.680 --> 43:28.680]  just you know at the end of the day I don't need anything to go to bed I'll you know knock
[43:28.680 --> 43:33.680]  out them I'm out cold well that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want

[43:38.680 --> 43:42.680]  possible that's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy
[43:42.680 --> 43:46.680]  that are healthy and natural that are time released and there's more money in it than
[43:46.680 --> 43:51.680]  anybody else puts in their product so that's why turbo force has such a great effect and
[43:51.680 --> 44:18.680]  so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force.

[46:20.680 --> 46:23.680]  this is gonna be huge I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more
[46:23.680 --> 46:26.680]  food even though the prices are going up for you so those are the type of discussions we
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.680]  have I'm just giving the inside base of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume

[46:36.680 --> 46:40.680]  you go right in the queue first come first serve but the fact that the orders are so
[46:40.680 --> 46:45.680]  ultra massive it's dizzy I mean this is just insane we're expecting that to put six to
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.680]  eight weeks to be safe and then if it continues like this we're looking at having to suspend
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.680]  food sales but everybody gets their order in we'll get your food but that's how big this
[46:54.680 --> 46:58.680]  is so what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on info or store.com
[47:24.680 --> 47:38.680]  short roads smart guy and he thinks coronavirus is really deadly he'll be in studio we got
[47:38.680 --> 47:42.680]  Dr. Steve McCinnick probably a different angle on that only smart cookie he'll be on this
[47:42.680 --> 47:53.680]  as well we're here ladies and gentlemen we're in the future it is the year 2020 we're 240
[47:53.680 --> 48:01.680]  days out from a historic election and everybody's calling me I'm getting constant streams of
[48:01.680 --> 48:06.680]  text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying is coronavirus really deadly
[48:06.680 --> 48:13.680]  how bad is it really and what I can tell them is this the coronavirus is man made we've
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.680]  gone over that the Indian Institute and others have tested other major institutes have scanned
[48:18.680 --> 48:24.680]  it it's 100% man made it's got the HIV delivery system it's got other families of viruses cut
[48:24.680 --> 48:32.680]  into it it is a one-eyed one horned flying purple people eater I mean it's like something
[48:32.680 --> 48:38.680]  of a Dr. Seuss book it's not normal it's a chimera that's the old Greek legend of a thing
[48:38.680 --> 48:49.680]  that would be part snake part lion part goat and that's what it is it is a bunch of different
[48:49.680 --> 48:57.680]  species of viruses spliced in and so we've seen an insane response in communist China and
[48:57.680 --> 49:03.680]  we've seen lockdowns and martial law in Italy I mean now they're walking down all of Italy
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.680]  schools are closed and we've got footage I'm going to show in a moment of body bags that
[49:08.680 --> 49:17.680]  the BBC just got leaked body bags many of them full of people in Iran is this a cover for
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.680]  another bio weapon I don't know but is it killing the economy is it causing a supply
[49:22.680 --> 49:27.680]  chain shutdown has China really shut down most of its cities yes so that event is real and
[49:27.680 --> 49:33.680]  is gigantic and never before seen so I would encourage listeners yes go get high quality
[49:33.680 --> 49:36.680]  swarovl foods we have the only company the biggest in the nation that actually still
[49:36.680 --> 49:39.680]  has food it does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got a package
[49:39.680 --> 49:44.680]  and they got the food info or store.com but I would encourage listeners to do the most
[49:44.680 --> 49:49.680]  important thing and that's drink purified water that's get sunshine that's pray that's
[49:49.680 --> 49:53.680]  get focused that's not be stressed out because you're prepared and that's get DNA

[50:58.680 --> 51:07.680]  virus is super deadly or not is huge what they pulled is going to be economically a
[51:07.680 --> 51:13.680]  weapon and we're now seeing it and it's now being confirmed so the videos up on
[51:13.680 --> 51:20.680]  infowarst.com of the body bags I would suggest everyone go look at the BBC leaked footage
[51:20.680 --> 51:26.680]  and then just ask yourself what's really going on and don't be caught flatfooted but just
[51:26.680 --> 51:32.680]  the metaphysical act of getting prepared just beginning to learn how to use a firearm
[51:32.680 --> 51:37.680]  and get some storeable food just that idea sets you on the path of not being domesticated
[51:37.680 --> 51:42.680]  not being dependent on the system and purchases at infowarstore.com are the highest quality

[51:56.680 --> 52:03.680]  the coronavirus news let's go ahead and roll this info wars.com posted video BBC publishes
[52:03.680 --> 52:11.680]  leaked Iran footage showing bagged bodies of coronavirus 19 victims piling up and that's
[52:11.680 --> 52:15.680]  what their governments leaked and people get arrested and the government ministers die
[52:15.680 --> 52:20.680]  what's going on Iran we're not sure but here's the video.
[52:20.680 --> 52:41.680]  All those dead bodies. By the way your brains is super computer so it has intuition that's
[52:41.680 --> 52:45.680]  not intuition it knows this footage is real you don't look at that you can tell you that
[52:45.680 --> 52:56.680]  it's real. Just look at it you know it's real. It's like you know an infomercial versus something
[52:56.680 --> 53:14.680]  real. And they're talking about all the dead bodies piling up everywhere and you've had
[53:14.680 --> 53:26.680]  government ministers die. Now what is it really more rooms of dead bodies in body bags.
[53:26.680 --> 53:33.680]  If it's at a 2% kill rate that the CDC believes it is and half the US population gets it that
[53:33.680 --> 53:39.680]  will be 3.3 million dead. I hope that's not the case but I know six years ago when it
[53:39.680 --> 53:44.680]  was a real deadly virus outbreak of a pneumonia type deal a SARS type deal that three family
[53:44.680 --> 53:51.680]  members of mine died in one month because they all lived in our family ranch in three
[53:51.680 --> 53:56.680]  different houses up on the top of the hill one across the street two beside each other
[53:56.680 --> 54:02.680]  and I was just everybody's dying I'm going to funerals and it's just I talked to the doctors
[54:02.680 --> 54:10.680]  in East Texas and Palestine is the name of the town and that's the nearest big big city
[54:10.680 --> 54:14.680]  bigger town and they're like oh man there's a huge cover up people are dying here every
[54:14.680 --> 54:19.680]  few hours it's just we've never seen it like this so there's been real mass die-offs before
[54:19.680 --> 54:26.680]  they just kind of cover them up. Why are they hyping it up now that's the bigger question
[54:26.680 --> 54:30.680]  that's what we're going to be discussing Stuart Rhodes founder of Oath Keepers is a
[54:30.680 --> 54:35.680]  constitutional lawyer from a Ron Paul advisor and just a really smart fellow he's in and
[54:35.680 --> 54:40.680]  then Dr. Steven Chenick while we're on will join us and he said a month ago that he believed
[54:40.680 --> 54:43.680]  he'd had it a bunch of others had had it and we now know that's true the CDC's come out
[54:43.680 --> 54:47.680]  and said oh actually it's been here a while and yeah there's a lot of upper respiratory
[54:47.680 --> 54:53.680]  problems and a lot of death taking place so why all the secrecy because it's man made
[54:53.680 --> 55:00.680]  and they want that information shut down and not discussed because Obama in 2015 for the
[55:00.680 --> 55:05.680]  North Carolina University transferred the engineered coronavirus. In fact we grabbed
[55:05.680 --> 55:09.680]  my coronavirus files I meant to have those I want to show folks the science journal and
[55:09.680 --> 55:14.680]  all the publications in the Indian journals and it was a big debate five years ago like
[55:14.680 --> 55:19.680]  why is the US government selling China this this this kind of coronavirus with all these
[55:19.680 --> 55:26.680]  sources combined together so there'd be plausible denonability later when it got released so who
[55:26.680 --> 55:31.680]  released it who's behind it well who hyped the hell out of it had it all scripted Gigi
[55:31.680 --> 55:35.680]  Ping's the main suspect to shut down the Taiwan independence movement to crack down on his
[55:35.680 --> 55:39.680]  own people and then to try to attack Trump the economy and have a cover because if Gigi
[55:39.680 --> 55:45.680]  Ping shut his economy down because he lost that trade war to be a terrorist economic
[55:45.680 --> 55:50.680]  war to turn against him but if he shuts his economy down because of a deadly virus whether
[55:50.680 --> 55:56.680]  it's really deadly super deadly or not you know it does kill some people but then you
[55:56.680 --> 56:03.680]  see he has a cover story for why he did it and I really gut level looking at all the evidence
[56:03.680 --> 56:09.680]  think that's the answer the Chi cons the globalists released it it does kill people it is man
[56:09.680 --> 56:14.680]  made but it's really the cover for China to launch this economic war on us because they're
[56:14.680 --> 56:17.680]  authoritarian they just locked the whole thing down to cover it up but they believe it'll
[56:17.680 --> 56:20.680]  bring down our economy and it's already hurt the stock market massively though Trump came
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.680]  back and said hey we're confident everything's okay it bounced back so that's my best money
[56:25.680 --> 56:32.680]  on this and I think we've been proven accurate so far we're going to shift gears get more
[56:32.680 --> 56:39.680]  into this and go through every facet of it when we come back but boy how the mighty have
[56:39.680 --> 56:44.680]  fallen Mike Bloomberg may have seventy eight million dollars he got through financial
[56:44.680 --> 56:50.680]  scams and manipulations there was computers that hooked up the stock market he's a little

[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:33.680]  this is after our economy this is after president Trump look at the CDC telling him it's no big
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:39.680]  deal and not a problem he was finally getting it but I went but it's bigger than that when
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:44.680]  it becomes a problem then they're going to say he didn't respond properly to it and ladies
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:49.680]  and gentlemen three days ago it's like they flip the light switch every radio show that's
[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:56.680]  national that's establishment newspapers MSNBC CNN ABC all the usual suspects I've got dozens
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:01.680]  of reports right here you've all seen them president Trump caused this president Trump
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:07.680]  didn't do enough president Trump's trying to cover it up this seems to match the facts
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:11.680]  what what facts are there that Democrats are doing this well people are asking questions
[1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:16.680]  and they're concerned about the fires this this implies some sort of political motivation
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:20.680]  which is kind of gross well I will tell you there's been a lot of irresponsible rhetoric
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:25.680]  among Democrats and commentators who is this on the left name some names sir well because
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:29.680]  this is just it just feels like gaslighting but please name some names I'm we're all big
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:33.680]  we'll read all big people here name some names there was a column in the New York Times that's
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:39.680]  that by a prominent liberal journalist it said we should rename it the Trump virus okay that
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:45.680]  that that is that applied it does that apply to all so that the motherly the scientist Mr. Fauci
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:51.680]  has been here in anyway all the way back to the Bush administration let me clarify I have
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:56.680]  never been muzzled ever and I've been doing this since the administration of Ronald Reagan I
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:01.680]  think when an administration government appears to be non-transparent on it then that creates
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:06.680]  problems I think that the Trump administration really grappled with that this past week when
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:10.680]  you saw President Trump come out and say it was a new hoax anything that they can use to
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:16.680]  try to hurt Trump they will for them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:21.680]  comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:26.680]  winning is a new level of sickness I want to give you an opportunity to respond to that
[1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:32.680]  comment from from Don Junior he should not be near me when he says that there would be a
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:38.680]  serious altercation Don Junior had better not get any place close to me frankly I think that
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:44.680]  was Don Junior's point that there has been some very strong rhetoric directed at the
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:49.680]  president you were down in Charleston last night using the word hoax when talking about
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:56.680]  Democrats somebody now is dead from this do you regret that kind of hoax referring to the
[1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:01.680]  action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we've done such a good job
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:06.680]  the hoax is on them not I'm not talking about what's happening here I'm talking what they're
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:12.680]  doing that's the hoax that's just a continuation of the hoax whether it's the impeachment hoax
[1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:17.680]  or the Russia Russia Russia hoax this is what I'm talking about certainly not referring to this
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:21.680]  how could anybody refer to this this is very serious so they start asking us hey what are you
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:27.680]  doing attacking the president because you're saying it's serious yes I'm saying it's serious
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:33.680]  because of how the whole media is unified how they use it for martial law in Italy and
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:39.680]  China and now all over the world Switzerland and all over clearly this is a big global
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:46.680]  move people better get ready but if they then release a virus they bought from Obama that
[1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:50.680]  they know is not super lethal but does kill some people and spreads fast will scare the
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:54.680]  hell out of folks they can push the vaccine later make money off that as well down Trump
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:59.680]  said just several days ago this was a democratic hoax what in God's name is he talking about
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:05.680]  has he no shame the Trump administration has been asleep at the wheel we know he doesn't
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:12.680]  have the capacity or the competence to handle such moments I cannot think of a worse person
[1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:18.680]  to put in charge of dealing with this coronavirus and his response has been pathetic this is
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:22.680]  not a democratic hoax this is incompetence on the part of the president of the United
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:27.680]  States out of that they can shut down their factories and order the city shut down order
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:32.680]  no one to go to work in all their major industrial sites and then that kills the global supply
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:38.680]  chain they've just checkmated Trump in America and you know that's what they did they did
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:44.680]  it with the deep state with the UN coordinated with the EU who are all on board to create
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:51.680]  hysteria and fear bring down the economy worldwide and then say President Trump and
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:58.680]  America and people that questioned when it's obviously overblown well I always promote

[1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:21.680]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide now into our number two of this March 4th 2020
[1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:28.680]  Wednesday transmission Stuart Rhodes founder of Oath Keepers a constitutional lawyer veteran is here with us to
[1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:34.680]  give his take on the coronavirus and he wanted to first bring up the fact that they founded major
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:38.680]  institutes it is man-made and that's the big elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about
[1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:43.680]  the question is why did China shut down its supply chain why they locked their cities down that's real
[1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:48.680]  that's a giant response that's creating a supply chain Armageddon as I said last hour I was talking to
[1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:54.680]  Stuart during the break he agrees this is China's way to try to win the trade war have face saving
[1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:59.680]  but if they shut their economy down just to show how we're dependent on them people say well you're a terrorist
[1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:05.680]  but if they did because of a coronavirus whether it's super deadly or not then they have the cover to do it
[1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:10.680]  and the Democrat media joins in it's all Trump's fault we predicted this a month ago now they're following
[1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:16.680]  that script exactly Stuart good to have you here with us likewise good to go I think this is the deep states
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:23.680]  take down a president Trump frankly and also their way to usher in draconian measures being being seen as
[1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:29.680]  as normal inside of our countries but instead of being draconian about keeping the virus out of the United
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:35.680]  States by locking down the borders and stopping international flights they instead you know borders are wide open
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:40.680]  and their only answer is that they're becoming draconian with us inside of our country and then they
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:46.680]  criticize Trump if you remember when he stopped the flights three weeks ago saying that they want the
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:51.680]  flights they want the flights to continue because they want to spread but he's making a mistake now by
[1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:56.680]  not stopping all international flights he stopped the flights from China and then Iran but what about Italy
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:08:01.680]  what about South Korea what about span that was a tragic mistake to lift those flights continue and now
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:07.680]  it's too late he should stop all international flights period but even even beyond that I think you were
[1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:12.680]  talking to Mike Adams yesterday about this the domestic flights are now spreading it around because it is
[1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:18.680]  airborne it's not just that you get it when when someone coughs near you with your six feet away you're
[1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:23.680]  safe it could be circulating through the air conditioning circling through the air in a school in an
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:29.680]  airport any enclosed space and you're going to breathe it in just like smallpox or just like measles
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:35.680]  that's what's different about this it's not the same as the flu and how it's transmitted it's also an aerosol
[1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:43.680]  it can be airborne give us your expertise you have a lot of sources it's not that FEMA has all the answers
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:48.680]  the military has all the answers but I was told a month ago by our sources in the Pentagon also FEMA
[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:53.680]  that we believe it kills about 2% of people and we're already having an undeclared emergency going on
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:58.680]  that's now been admitted and then it broke containment over a month ago that was down the news a month later
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:03.680]  so we've got good sources and they're not sure because they're looking at well who dies were they already
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:10.680]  old they had previously conditions they don't know when one lands at study says 15% die what we're saying is
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:17.680]  about 2% that's great news but that's still 30 something times the number of deaths we see with the flu
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:24.680]  so even at 2% this is going to be a 3 million dead person event if half the public ends up contracting it
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:31.680]  and again you have the BBC publishes leaked Iran footage showing bagged bodies of corona 19 victims piling up
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:36.680]  we're going to play this again in a moment we've got time to debunk skeptics coronavirus 19 as a death rate
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:42.680]  there's about 34 times higher than the flu and you look at these numbers Italy closes all schools
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:48.680]  I'm in coronavirus outbreak so is it the biggest hype we've ever seen with China shutting their economy off
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:56.680]  almost all their cities or is it really big it's both I think I think you can take advantage of a real crisis
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:01.680]  you know the old the old saying never let a crisis go to waste I think it's true for a real one as well
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:06.680]  you could have it could be as deadly as a Spanish flu or more deadly as Dr. Boyd said right you have
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:12.680]  a boy on your show saying he predicts to be more deadly than the Spanish flu the death rates of 2% are presuming
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:17.680]  that China is being honest which we know they're not about the numbers of dead I think it's far closer to 6%
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:24.680]  or 10% but even if it's only 2% in the United States you only have six beds per thousand people in any given hospital
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:30.680]  so there's not enough beds there's not enough ventilators for you to be taken care of if you become one of the very
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:34.680]  very ill that's another issue that's going to happen it's going to be triage they're going to have to take on
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:38.680]  and decide who has a chance of living and who's not going to live and that's going to get the care
[1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:44.680]  and if you look at the exponential growth it's going to peak probably the end of the summer and they don't know
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:49.680]  they hope hot weather shuts it down like the flu normally would be but again I go back to the beginning
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:55.680]  it's man-made you've got the articles documents that's not debated now what is behind this and I'm sure you know
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:01.680]  I've got it right here even the Journal of Science reported back in 2015 Obama authorized himself
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:07.680]  because the scientists didn't want to do it the transfer of this very Kamiro virus to the CHICOM
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:10.680]  so why why do they do that?
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:18.680]  Well like Dr. Boyd said they're all in cahoots the CDC the World Health Organization is part of the military industrial complex
[1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:23.680]  that does all of these this research around the world and whether they intend to use it on the people themselves
[1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:29.680]  or they're you know being benign and trying to create vaccines for other possible uses you know who knows
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:34.680]  but the thing is regardless they're the source right regardless it was it was man-made I think Dr. Boyd is right
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:42.680]  it was man-made in the Wuhan lab the Indian scientists the report from them right here you know points out that it has HIV in it
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:50.680]  HIV delivery and by the way it's conclusive they're looking at the virus it's cut in it's right so it's a chronic disease like HIV
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:56.680]  it doesn't attack your immune system what it does is much like HIV keeps coming back keeps coming back
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:01.680]  and it'll attack your heart next and then your brain and they're saying that encephalitis is one of the strains they found in it
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:07.680]  encephalitis is a deadly brain infection that's why people just drop dead of heart failure or just drop dead in the streets
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:09.680]  So it's a soft kill weapon?
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:15.680]  Well it keeps going like one guy said that leaked it he said look it's like Russian roulette you're playing Russian roulette
[1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:19.680]  okay you didn't die this time let's pull a trigger again next time it keeps coming back
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:23.680]  Because we can put that virus up from the Indian report which is conclusive CRISPR scan
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:27.680]  it's got it's all just it's it's it's bristling with weapons it's all just been
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:32.680]  right they combine HIV with MERS and coronavirus is the is the shell that carries it
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:37.680]  people say oh it's like the common cold well that's the that's the that's the carry mechanism that's the delivery mechanism
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:40.680]  yeah the cold is the most spreadable thing it's the delivery system
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:45.680]  it's even worse than the cold because it is airborne it's so small that it goes right down in the very bottom of your lungs
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:51.680]  it inflames your entire lungs even worse than pneumonia and because it's so small it can be suspended in the air
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:54.680]  right now in air conditioning in here you can be breathing it not know it
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:56.680]  So a plane or cruise ship's perfect?
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:01.680]  Oh yeah I'm not flying anymore there's no way in fact some of our guys are going to come down to a conference here in Texas
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:06.680]  they cancel their flights to my medical guys so they understand that the danger you should not be in enclosed space
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:12.680]  schools offices churches airplanes if you want to avoid this virus the best thing you can do is stay out of the space
[1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:16.680]  let's show the footage it's on info wars.com and news wars.com
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:23.680]  BBC publishes leaked Iran footage showing bagged bodies of coronavirus victims piling up
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:30.680]  media space correspondent Joyce Carmen comments on the newly published video it's all there videos all of it at
[1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:32.680]  info wars but to here it is
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:42.680]  and radio listeners it's room after room of dead bodies and body bags tagged and
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:47.680]  positive death on it
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:05.680]  this is what trump has got to seal our borders
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:09.680]  you should put the military on the border with Mexico and lock that border down
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:16.680]  happy cannon said a week ago he said go in point out you shut down the border shut them down more
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.680]  and expose this whole thing
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:22.680]  Reese is using the coronavirus to the border down they should anyways for the Islamic invasion
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:27.680]  exactly trump should seize on this to endorse and and and prove everything he said
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:31.680]  right because if you don't stop this if he doesn't take decisive action you should stop
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:35.680]  frankly should stop all international flights period if not all domestic flights
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:39.680]  and shut down the border with troops on the border like I've been calling for and you've been
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:43.680]  calling for for years you should do this now because if he doesn't take decisive action
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:47.680]  first of all it's the right thing to do if he doesn't do it you'll be blamed for every death
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:51.680]  they will they're gonna blame him no matter what happens he might as well do the right thing
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:57.680]  that's the only course is strong action right it's from action now to exclude it it's it's like
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:01.680]  when you're home I can't just come to your house we get along great I kid is walking
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:05.680]  your house when I want to because you exclude people from your home now you call
[1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:09.680]  or I call you and say I'm gonna come over right you come as a guest but no one has
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:15.680]  a right to be here you want to be draconian maybe draconian about excluding others so you can have freedom inside
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:19.680]  of your space inside of your nation or inside of your home well I think about
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:23.680]  privacy is like it's a bad thing no it the privacy is the root of freedom
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:27.680]  is that you control your space including your nation because they failed and they
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:31.680]  failed and they convinced and tricked trump into failing to secure our nation by excluding people
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:37.680]  they're now gonna become draconian about us force you to be staying your house
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:41.680]  that's the key that's that guys was in yesterday's article stack I didn't get to it
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:45.680]  what the containment what the quarantines will look like in America the FEMA FEMA set to declare emergency

[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:07.680]  this is something you need on your checklist to have done but for me it just is a bummer to know that
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:12.680]  everybody needs food and I had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:16.680]  different levels of this right now the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:20.680]  but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed
[1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:26.680]  but understand the last food company the biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their regular order
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:31.680]  and they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week
[1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:35.680]  and at a certain point just saying we're done because people are going to take food orders out ten weeks
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:39.680]  we don't want to sit on your money ten weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes with that
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:43.680]  because we're honest under promise over deliver but technically it's going to be six to eight weeks

[1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:54.680]  I'm worried about my three daughters and my son and my wife that's who I'm worried about
[1:20:54.680 --> 1:21:03.680]  and I'm gonna say this again very very slowly we've never seen a response by any country like China
[1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:08.680]  to shut down almost all their major cities and to kill the worldwide supply chain
[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:18.680]  that bullet already left the barrel this is huge this is economic Armageddon
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:22.680]  and I believe Trump's trying to prop it up he admits he is and that's a lot of them
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:27.680]  and I get hits his job to look stable and be calm
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:33.680]  I told you five weeks ago gut level I feel disturbance in the force
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:38.680]  and then you get the early study out of Lancet which is very respected
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:43.680]  15% death rates well that's who came to the hospital and it's very specific for Asians
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:50.680]  still kills other folks we hope that wasn't right then the US government said well maybe up to 2% death rate
[1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:55.680]  well that's three plus million dead if they think it'll affect half who knows that's even right
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:22:01.680]  this is all just shooting the dark Fox News now reporting coronavirus global death rate at 3.4%
[1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:09.680]  the Olympics delay a possibility World Health officials confirmed today the fatality rate for the new coronavirus
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:15.680]  is at 3.4% globally as Japan Olympics minister says there's a possibility of 2020 summer games
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:22.680]  and Tokyo to be delayed and then it just goes on from there so what's a 3.4 of a 2%
[1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:28.680]  in the US is 3.3 million now we're up at 5 billion or so dead
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:33.680]  the response to that in the economy is going to be devastating and what did Bill Maher say
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:37.680]  what the Democrats say before this happened we want economic warfare we want to bring down the economy
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:41.680]  now they've been on every channel licking their lips and we hope this hurts Trump
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:46.680]  if this happens they get the blame for daring to say Trump did this and it's his fault
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:49.680]  when they're the ones that tried to block the airplanes coming back
[1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:52.680]  Stuart this is very obvious now the scenario is playing out
[1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:57.680]  right that's why Trump should take the size of action we're talking on the break about the economic outcome
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:02.680]  is going to be devastating either way because once people start getting really ill across the country
[1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:08.680]  and dying I just saw a leak from a guy in Georgia it's hitting small town Georgia
[1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:12.680]  so when that happens people are going to stop going to work they're going to pull their kids out of school
[1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:17.680]  they won't be flying they won't be going to movies anyway there's going to be an economic downturn
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:23.680]  no matter what happens they may as well minimize the actual death in this country by stopping domestic flights
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:27.680]  that's what he should do right now and calling for all the schools to close
[1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:31.680]  that's the right thing to do Italy just did that good they need to
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:36.680]  and that's the right thing to do but the only way to save his presidency he is otherwise going to lose
[1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:41.680]  I predict because they're going to blame it all on him I want to just be 100% clear
[1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:46.680]  when I saw China locking down its biggest cities and shutting down trade four weeks ago I said
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:51.680]  this will be a supply chain nightmare and either they've lost the biggest folks in history
[1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:53.680]  or this stuff is really deadly and they're covering it up
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:56.680]  I think now we know they're covering up the real death rate
[1:23:56.680 --> 1:24:00.680]  yeah it's real they had no choice to shut that down but it's also having the ripple effect
[1:24:00.680 --> 1:24:05.680]  of the downturn in goods here in the United States because we're so dependent on China
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:10.680]  it's both it's going to be both a real crisis and it's going to be economic warfare
[1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:14.680]  so let's put our best thing in caps on here and I've got Stephen Chen and I really respect coming on
[1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:17.680]  he'll have a different view we're not a cult we want to hear the other side
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:22.680]  I'm not sure where he's at on this now but I agree with him it's been here for months and a lot of people have had it
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:28.680]  and that's his intel that's been proven right it's very specific so hopefully it isn't as bad here as it is in China
[1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:34.680]  and again I'm sorry for the Chinese folks but I'm trying to look at the best worst case scenario here
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:40.680]  let's do it it being man-made the former head of the you know the guy that wrote the U.S. Bioweapons Law
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:44.680]  has talked to UN folks at 100% man-made Dr. Francis Boyle I think he's back on tomorrow
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:50.680]  right it's man-made that's not being discussed that's that's the elephant in the room isn't it
[1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:56.680]  that in fact it's airborne that's aerosol it's not sure no I agree with you but I'm saying there's a military guy a lawyer
[1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:04.680]  the fact that it's man-made that that an Obama in 2015 I have the articles he transferred to China that's that's got to be discussed
[1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:09.680]  if we get that out they will still have some dead but at least they won't be able to blame America and Trump
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:15.680]  I think we need to start hammering the globalist stand-to-game the chockham stand-to-game it's man-made Obama transferred it to him
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:19.680]  I agree but Trump has to also do what he has to do to protect the American people
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:23.680]  I agree and that's shut down the borders and shut down international flight you think
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.680]  I think domestic flights too I mean if it's airborne which it is it's going to be transferred throughout that entire plane
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:34.680]  anything someone who has it breeze out will be breathed in by the other passengers you should just stop going to schools
[1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:40.680]  stop going out to theaters and stop going to church frankly do it all over the Internet you got to isolate yourself
[1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:46.680]  because otherwise you're going to really not this is a father of a happy a lot of kids
[1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:53.680]  not this is a military veteran and a lawyer and Ron Paul's advisor to gut level you really think this is the big one
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:58.680]  well I think yeah I think it's legit I think I think we're living the movie contagion I think I think this is a serious threat
[1:25:58.680 --> 1:26:01.680]  and it's going to never hurt you this alarmist before
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:06.680]  no well here's here's the thing if it comes back again and again the person in fact they've already said
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:08.680]  and if it isn't as bad as we think we at least did what we had to
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:11.680]  yeah well re-infection is more dangerous I just saw an article
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:14.680]  oh that's confirmed it's like AIDS it comes back HIV
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:17.680]  and the second time it comes back it attacks your heart
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:21.680]  well that's already out there in the mainstream press which is exactly what the whistleblowers
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:26.680]  listen I'm not they won't test people they admit people go in they won't test them because they know it's everywhere
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:31.680]  and I'm not saying I had it but I've been I haven't had a cold a fever over four years
[1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:36.680]  I finally got one flying to Grand Cayman for a quick vacation over a month ago shouldn't have done it
[1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:40.680]  and I've had fevers come back a few times a middle of the night I get up I've got a fever
[1:26:40.680 --> 1:26:43.680]  and my lungs won't just stop won't stop coughing
[1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:47.680]  I'm not saying that's what it is but you know everybody I know is you know
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:52.680]  what's the thing is so everyone's going to be paranoid now and you and you of course you're not paranoid they're really out to get you
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:56.680]  but everyone's going to be worried that every cold every flu is the coronavirus
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:27:00.680]  and so they're going to react I'm just saying I haven't had a fever in over four years
[1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:04.680]  and I and I last month well you're breathing coronavirus right now who knows what it is
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:08.680]  but something there could be something else out there this is the cover for
[1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:14.680]  well I mean I think I think HIV can combine with the cephalitis and and MERS is bad enough
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:19.680]  bad enough guys pull up the major Indian University study I want to show them when we come back the virus
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:22.680]  and Dr. Steve Pachana used to run Psychological Warfare of the State Department
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:27.680]  he's overthrown governments he is who he says he is people hear this every talk they go that sounds crazy
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:30.680]  he's had the just department come after him when he's come on the show and talks about
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:34.680]  you know what happened in Italy and Gladio and all the rest of it so you know he's definitely
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:38.680]  interesting fella he's dolled into a lot of folks he's there kind of with the president's line
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:43.680]  you know hey okay yeah it's like the flu it might kill you but big deal America's great
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:47.680]  that was the one he was on three weeks ago he's going to come on
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:50.680]  I haven't filtered what he's going to say and I want you to hear the other side of this
[1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:52.680]  or he may agree with the start
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:56.680]  you should have the doctor from the UK on Dr. Campbell he's been following us very very closely
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:01.680]  get him on yeah and we're getting boiled but Francis boiled back on and we're going to have them all on
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:05.680]  there it is Indian scientists discovered coronavirus engineer with HIV AIDS like
[1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:10.680]  insertions and then the best articles in zero heads they had this the report or click on the paper
[1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:16.680]  because it shows the scan of the virus it shows the RNA and and protein insertion points
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:22.680]  where they edited the virus I mean it's like a woman that's had you know had a had a had a
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:27.680]  had a breast implants you see the scars I mean it's right there it's like it's not even debatable
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:32.680]  but this thing got yeah scroll down and actually show the virus itself there's a scan of the virus
[1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:36.680]  and it and it actually shows the whole insertion points I think it's up at the top guys

[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:45.680]  it's brilliant you've taken the very element that they try to repress you with
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:50.680]  silence and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:56.680]  silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence

[1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:25.680]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:30.680]  I didn't start selling high-quality, durable food.
[1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:33.680]  When this coronavirus thing popped up, I've been selling it for 20-plus years.
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:35.680]  They're the best sponsor of my Patriot.
[1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:37.680]  They dropped shit right from our site.
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:39.680]  And it's just good to have for the economy.
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:42.680]  It's good to have high-quality food to beat inflation.
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:44.680]  And it funds the Info War.
[1:33:44.680 --> 1:33:46.680]  The other major suppliers are saying they have food.
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:47.680]  They don't. They're lying.
[1:33:47.680 --> 1:33:49.680]  Now store shelves are selling out.
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:53.680]  We know the hysteria and China shutting down their supply chain is huge.
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:57.680]  Whether this virus is highly deadly or whether it's like the flu.
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:33:59.680]  We're going to discuss all that here in a moment.
[1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:02.680]  But we know we are not in Kansas anymore.
[1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:03.680]  Well, the crazy is going on.
[1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:08.680]  But what I know is that everybody should take care of their own immunity.
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:13.680]  And what I personally do is take high-quality, atomic-clean iodine, X2 and X3.
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:15.680]  We have that in stock, 40% off.
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:17.680]  We have lowered prices during this crisis.
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:22.680]  Our super silver wound gel, our super silver toothpaste that's FDA-approved,
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:26.680]  that have low levels of nano silver in it that you can actually brush with.
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:27.680]  Amazing. People love it.
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:28.680]  That's 50% off.
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:29.680]  It's about to sell out.
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:33.680]  We have the ultimate turmeric formula, bodies, 95% or cumanoid.
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:35.680]  That's amazing for your immune system, your whole body.
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:38.680]  People think it's better than Advil in many cases for pain.
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:40.680]  See what it does for you personally.
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:44.680]  That's all 40% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:47.680]  And I would personally be boosting my immunity.
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:48.680]  We don't sell elderberries.
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:51.680]  People know that's good for antiviral.
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:52.680]  So there's 100 brands of it.
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:53.680]  It's out there.
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:54.680]  Give it to yourself.
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:55.680]  Give it to your children.
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:00.680]  But for the products that others don't have, we have them at infowarstore.com.
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:04.680]  And we also have, somebody already took the box out of here.
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:08.680]  He says, this has been sold out for months.
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:12.680]  And you want to get your socks blown off.
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:21.680]  This has five forms of natural occurring energy that lasts for 10 hours spaced out with the vitamins and minerals and other cofactors uploaded to your brain.
[1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:25.680]  I have already have so much energy that if I've got to stay up 24 hours sometimes, the coast goes to him.
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:27.680]  I'll take half a packet at like seven o'clock at night.
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:30.680]  I don't really need stimulants already have so much naturally pretty manic.
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:34.680]  But turbo force is the strongest, cleanest thing you're going to find out there.
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:36.680]  I mean, it's people get it.
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:37.680]  They just can't believe it.
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:41.680]  It's back in stock infowarstore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:43.680]  So be sure and take advantage of that.
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:47.680]  Now the next 45 minutes or so that our Steve Pachett is going to ride a shot down with us.
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:50.680]  We have Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, a great patriot.
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  And of course, a constitutional lawyer no longer practicing here with us as well to cover the waterfront.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:35:59.680]  And I want to get into coronavirus next segment.
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:01.680]  But I want to first get both your take on this.
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:08.680]  But first, Dr. Pachett, Dr. Pachett, you were on a lot in the last year and we appreciate you coming back on.
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:10.680]  You were on for about a year and a half or so.
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:12.680]  You're too busy writing books and working on things.
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:14.680]  And you just kept saying, don't worry.
[1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:17.680]  The emblematic Democrats are like zombies, crypt keepers.
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:18.680]  It's all over.
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:20.680]  It's a political realignment.
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:21.680]  Their party's done.
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:24.680]  And now we see that and we Bloomberg's totally failed.
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:25.680]  You predicted that.
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:27.680]  But I get upset.
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:33.680]  I actually get concerned at this level of incompetence when Biden clearly has dementia getting worse.
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:36.680]  They banned me on Facebook a second time eight months ago for saying he can't talk.
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:38.680]  Looks like he's had another stroke.
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:43.680]  Now he's doing a faux pas, a canard, a foot in the mouth every 10 seconds.
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:48.680]  Clearly I've had family that was great people, but they got dementia and acted like this.
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:50.680]  He's degenerating very, very quickly.
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:51.680]  You're a psychiatrist.
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:55.680]  You're not going to violate the Goldwater Act here and diagnosed from afar.
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:37:00.680]  Also as a medical doctor and a veteran and co-founder of Delta Force and best selling author with Tom Clancy.
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:03.680]  I mean, all your laurels or folks don't know who you are.
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:11.680]  But emblematically or archetypally, what the hell is going on with the Democrats right now and how they're trying to frame Trump for coronavirus?
[1:37:11.680 --> 1:37:12.680]  Because I agree.
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:15.680]  They're hyping it and blaming Trump regardless of how deadly it is.
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:21.680]  Them trying to blame the president when he tried to block the planes from China and they didn't want to.
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:22.680]  You're a smart guy.
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:23.680]  Finn sliced this for me.
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:26.680]  What in hell is going on here?
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:30.680]  What you see is what I said a while ago and I can diagnose.
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:36.680]  I did politically publicly say that Biden has seen our dementia.
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:45.680]  The time and the day when he got the wrong time and the wrong state he was in, it was clear to me that he had senility and he has senility now.
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:47.680]  I don't apologize for it.
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:49.680]  I don't violate any Goldwater rule.
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:54.680]  The bottom line of all of this is actually quite interesting.
[1:37:54.680 --> 1:38:02.680]  Remember years ago, I told you that the power would shift to the South and Southwest and it has in the same.
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:04.680]  You said that 15 years ago and I rolled my eyes.
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:05.680]  You were dead on.
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:06.680]  You said the EU will fall.
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:08.680]  America will take over.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:09.680]  Correct.
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:11.680]  And we will take over.
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:20.680]  However, there will be a new phenomenon which I predicted and that is the decentralization of power away from Washington.
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:25.680]  So what you're seeing right now is not only the end of the Democratic Party.
[1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:26.680]  They're finished.
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:33.680]  When you have a Bloomberg and you have a Bernie Sanders, you have a Jew who's a socialist and a Jew's a billionaire.
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:39.680]  You have played out the scenario of any conceivable rationality for the Democrats.
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:45.680]  But from my point of view, it reinforced the notion we do not have a Democratic Party.
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:47.680]  We do not have a Republican Party.
[1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:51.680]  Trump in many ways does not have a Republican Party.
[1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:56.680]  He has his own party and he is creating the new American ethos.
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:57.680]  Correct.
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:05.680]  And in that new American ethos, everything is coming down to the local city level and county level.
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:08.680]  It even bypasses the state level.
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:16.680]  In other words, what's happening is the nation town, the nation city, the nation county is so far more important.
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:18.680]  And in terms of...
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:19.680]  I got to interrupt you.
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:21.680]  I asked Stuart Rose during the break.
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:22.680]  I said, what do you want to cover?
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:26.680]  And he said basically they've got their sanctuary cities.
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.680]  We've got our Second Amendment cities.
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:32.680]  He wanted to get to this very de-evolution of power back to the people.
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:33.680]  You're absolutely correct.
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:37.680]  The focus of effort now is at the county level already.
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:42.680]  I just spent a month in Virginia where they're raising county militias at the local level
[1:39:42.680 --> 1:39:44.680]  in reaction to their governor turning tyrannical.
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:46.680]  That's happening in New Mexico.
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:48.680]  It's happening all across the country.
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:50.680]  And they're not like radical, coup-racist militias.
[1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:53.680]  They're like under the Constitution and the President.
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:54.680]  Dr. Britannik, sorry.
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:55.680]  Go ahead.
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:57.680]  So we have exactly what he said.
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:03.680]  We have in our county, Bradford County, we have a Second Amendment sanctuary city.
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:09.680]  So that means we're allowed to carry the Second Amendment and no one can violate that on any basis.
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:11.680]  So that's exactly he's correct.
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:14.680]  And we have that at the local county level.
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:15.680]  We don't need it at the national level.
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:19.680]  So it's the rediscovery of the individual of self-determination and political will.
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:20.680]  Correct.
[1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:23.680]  And that's basically where we're heading towards.
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:28.680]  Thanks to you and many others, we were able to provide what they call the alternative press.
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:34.680]  But really the ongoing reality that those parties, the Democrats, Republicans, congressmen.
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:38.680]  They ignored the will of the people and the will of the people will manifest.
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:39.680]  Correct.
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:40.680]  And they have manifested.
[1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:45.680]  Basically, they said we do not want any whites, Jews, Catholics.
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:51.680]  What's going to happen is that the will of the people at the local level can't be that easily determined
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:57.680]  because it will be kind of a spontaneous organization on issues that are local.
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:02.680]  So for us, Second Amendment was local and we defended the Second Amendment.
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:07.680]  In another county, let's say Gainesville or Lattua, they don't care about Second Amendment.
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:08.680]  That's their problem.
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:10.680]  But we care about our own county.
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.680]  We care about our own policemen.
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:13.680]  We care about our own hospitals.
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:15.680]  We care about our schools.
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:19.680]  I can't worry about the governor of Florida who may have been not be good.
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:27.680]  You're saying the entropy and the entropy of the establishment is a vacuum into which we will enter.
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:28.680]  Correct.
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:29.680]  And you're seeing entropy.
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:30.680]  That's an excellent word.
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:36.680]  You're seeing the second law of thermodynamics in the Republican and Democratic Party.
[1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:43.680]  And I've got to give Nancy Pelosi credit because she was the cynical unknown of self-destructive behavior,
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:45.680]  which I said on your show.
[1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:53.680]  She showed how useless, worthless the Democrats were and what congressional representatives really were doing,
[1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:55.680]  wasting our time, totally corrupt.
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:00.680]  I mean, how do you explain you have a socialist who's a multimillionaire?
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:03.680]  I've got Biden, a multimillionaire who's also corrupt.
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:05.680]  I have a socialist who's corrupt.
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:07.680]  I have Pelosi who's corrupt.
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:08.680]  Onward and onward.
[1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:09.680]  I don't have a businessman among them.
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:12.680]  Why can't they produce one dynamic person?
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:14.680]  That doesn't make me overconfident.
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:15.680]  It actually scares me.
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:24.680]  It shouldn't scare you because the bottom line is that the political arena is no longer relevant to those of us who have been entrepreneurs
[1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:26.680]  who have been in combat.
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:30.680]  You're saying it's just nothing but delusionals that enter that field now?
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:33.680]  Yeah, they are self-aggrandizing individuals.
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:35.680]  When they come in, think of the dynamics.
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:37.680]  They come and say to you, look, I'm great.
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:38.680]  I want you to support me.
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:39.680]  I'm going to be great.
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:41.680]  Then when they get in, they don't remember who you are.
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:45.680]  So it's a self-aggrandizing, narcissistic, self-destructive business.
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:46.680]  No, you're right.
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:47.680]  They don't even get quid pro quo.
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:49.680]  They don't have symbiosis.
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:53.680]  Well, they're right back with our Chief of Cheney and our guest, Rick Rhodes.
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:00.680]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:04.680]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:05.680]  Yeah.
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:06.680]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:07.680]  I love women.
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:09.680]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:10.680]  You may have problems with her.
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:11.680]  You may get a divorce.
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:12.680]  You may whatever.
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:16.680]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:17.680]  loved.

[1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:00.680]  turbo force, you need to try it.
[1:44:00.680 --> 1:44:02.680]  I've tried turbo force with everything.
[1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:04.680]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:07.680]  I put turbo force in my coffee.
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:08.680]  That was a crazy week.
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:11.680]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite.
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:14.680]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control
[1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:19.680]  of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:23.680]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:24.680]  better life.
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:25.680]  I'm going to wake up today.
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:26.680]  You know what?
[1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:29.680]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:30.680]  and richer.

[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:34.680]  I don't think that happens very often.
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:35.680]  It's never happened to me.
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:37.680]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:39.680]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:41.680]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that.
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:42.680]  And that was me.
[1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:43.680]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:45.680]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:46.680]  I want to take control of my health.

[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:53.680]  Drink the turbo force.
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:56.680]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.

[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:23.680]  We've got former Army Colonel John Seamus here who actually ran FEMA operations.
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:26.680]  He's going to be popping in later in the hour.
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:28.680]  Stuart Rhodes brought him here.
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:31.680]  I don't want to overplay how big this is.
[1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:35.680]  And Dr. Pachinic, I'm not disagreeing with you that America can handle this.
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:36.680]  And I agree with Trump.
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:38.680]  We shouldn't create a bunch of fear.
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:41.680]  But the experts say this is man-made.
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:44.680]  Obama transferred it five years ago to China.
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:48.680]  And now Fox is reporting 3-plus percent death rates.
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:50.680]  Who knows if that's even accurate?
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:51.680]  You're a medical doctor.
[1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:53.680]  You know, psychiatrists the whole nine yards.
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:55.680]  I haven't talked to you in a few weeks.
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:57.680]  I follow steepachinic.com.
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:03.680]  But I want to get your current analysis and your current assessment of the coronavirus
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:04.680]  and what we're facing.
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:07.680]  A month ago, I told you I had it.
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:08.680]  And I did have it.
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:11.680]  I had seen a Chinese student a week later.
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:12.680]  I got a pneumonia.
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:14.680]  I treated it with antibiotics.
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:15.680]  And that was it.
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:21.680]  I said a month ago, it's not a lethal entity, but what it is is pervasive.
[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:23.680]  It has an epitope.
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:29.680]  In other words, it has some genetic coding that allows it to attach very quickly to individuals.
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:36.680]  In particular, the most vulnerable people would be people my age, elderly, 60, 70, with preconditions.
[1:48:36.680 --> 1:48:40.680]  For the most part, the mortality rate is one in a thousand.
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:51.680]  So out of 90,000 cases out of 1.4 billion in China, there were only 3,000 cases and 3,000 deaths.
[1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:53.680]  Is this engineered?
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:54.680]  I don't think so.
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:55.680]  And I'll tell you why.
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.680]  Number one, if you look on the can of Lysol, you will see coronavirus.
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:06.680]  Number two, if you want to create a virus biological warfare, which I know quite a lot about,
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:08.680]  you don't create a coronavirus.
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:15.680]  They're far more lethal entities, but they don't work in biological warfare because we have some other restrictions on it.
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:23.680]  So the reality is, you know, Fort Dietrich can produce all kinds of toxic elements, so does Desiree elsewhere.
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:26.680]  But this is not created by some entity.
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:28.680]  This has been around for centuries.
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:31.680]  It's just a variation of the influenza.
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:37.680]  The influenza, ironically, has a higher mortality rate than the coronavirus.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:41.680]  There you could have 54,000 people killed, and you wouldn't know the difference.
[1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:46.680]  So the reality is such that Trump is doing the best he can do.
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:48.680]  The CDC did not do well.
[1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:50.680]  HHS did not do well.
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:56.680]  But there's one doctor in particular who trained me at Cornell Med School, and he's exceedingly good.
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:50:01.680]  And that's Dr. Tony Fauci, and he said, look, he can't tell you what's going to happen.
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:04.680]  I will tell you it will be far more pervasive.
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:07.680]  There will be a pandemic, but that shouldn't scare people.
[1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:10.680]  What it simply means is that a lot of people will be infected.
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:14.680]  They'll get over it, and the mortality rate will be very low.
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:22.680]  But the stock market will react to that issue of penetration because our supply chains are broken up.
[1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:24.680]  So that's what I will predict.
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:30.680]  And remember, I had it, then somebody else in my family had it, and it lasts for about a week or so.
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:32.680]  Well, let's pull back from that.
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:34.680]  What I know you said is accurate.
[1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:37.680]  I'm going to screen the other part, but I know it's dead accurate.
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:39.680]  We've never seen such a supply chain.
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:42.680]  China didn't shut down all those cities for no reason.
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:45.680]  That is creating a supply chain nightmare.
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:46.680]  It's hurting the stock market.
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:53.680]  And then the media is blaming Trump as if he has something to do with China.
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:58.680]  I think Trump needs to get out ahead of this more, even attack the media for what they're saying.
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:50:59.680]  What do you think, Stuart?
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:02.680]  Well, I think I disagree with the doctor in this sense.
[1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:05.680]  I don't think that Trump is doing all he can do.
[1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:11.680]  Just as he stopped flights from China, he should have stopped flights from South Korea, Japan, and Italy.
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:12.680]  Does this start there?
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:19.680]  It makes no sense at all not to do the exact same thing with other countries that are now experiencing the pandemic.
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:21.680]  Well, let's ask you that question, but let's ask this.
[1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:24.680]  Why would the CDC say, don't buy masks, they don't help you?
[1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:26.680]  Dr. Buchanik?
[1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:28.680]  That's a very simple answer.
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:31.680]  The answer has nothing to do with helping or not helping.
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:34.680]  The CDC will need those masks.
[1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:42.680]  And APT Corporation in Ottawa will produce it because the CDC will need the masks for the doctors and the hospitals.
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:44.680]  So it's a triage?
[1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:46.680]  Well, no, it's not only a triage.
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:50.680]  It's really saying, look, we need those masks.
[1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:52.680]  The common folks doesn't need it.
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:59.680]  In that sense, yeah, it's a commercial triage, but the reality is such that we will need masks.
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:03.680]  We will need, you know, the suits and all those elements.
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:10.680]  And we will need to support corporations like there and others who will develop an antibody to it.
[1:52:10.680 --> 1:52:12.680]  But they're not telling the American people the truth about that.
[1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:16.680]  They're not saying you need a mask, but don't get one because we need the more.
[1:52:16.680 --> 1:52:17.680]  But that's the thing.
[1:52:17.680 --> 1:52:19.680]  Whether it's super deadly or not.
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:22.680]  They're like hoarding masks and Pence says, oh, we need masks.
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:24.680]  We're ramping up mass production.
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:26.680]  The CDC says, you don't need it.
[1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:29.680]  I think it's that BSing to not create a panic that will create a panic.
[1:52:29.680 --> 1:52:32.680]  That's all I'm saying, Dr. Pachett.
[1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:34.680]  What Stuart said is correct.
[1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:37.680]  I have not gone into the expertise.
[1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:40.680]  Number one, I'm not a fan of Mike Pence.
[1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:41.680]  I told you a year ago.
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:44.680]  Well, Stuart said before he went on air, he doesn't trust Pence.
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:45.680]  He thinks it's a setup against Trump.
[1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:46.680]  What do you think?
[1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:50.680]  I don't know if it's a setup, but basically Pence is incompetent.
[1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:51.680]  He was incompetent.
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:54.680]  He was an Indiana mayor, a governor and a congressman.
[1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:55.680]  He's nothing.
[1:52:55.680 --> 1:53:00.680]  He's just a politician who self-aggrandizing with a history that's quite bad.
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:02.680]  The reality is the following.
[1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:03.680]  You've got Tony Fauci.
[1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:05.680]  You don't have the CDC.
[1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:06.680]  You don't have HHS.
[1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:08.680]  Get rid of all those people.
[1:53:08.680 --> 1:53:09.680]  They're not useful.
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:11.680]  The CDC was way behind.
[1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:13.680]  Didn't have the proper test.
[1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:17.680]  And this is an example of what I was saying a long time ago for Trump.
[1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:22.680]  You need somebody in the White House to start cleaning out the institutions.
[1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:27.680]  You're talking about thousands of people who can't make a decision and can't be proactive.
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:32.680]  The truth of the matter is there's one guy who will be the focal point, and that's Fauci.
[1:53:32.680 --> 1:53:35.680]  Whatever he says will be what comes about.
[1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:38.680]  In other words, he will say there will be a pandemic.
[1:53:38.680 --> 1:53:42.680]  There will be an epidemic, and we will need masks and gowns.
[1:53:42.680 --> 1:53:44.680]  That's an issue.
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:46.680]  If Trump can handle that, that's fine.
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:47.680]  He has to declare it.
[1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:49.680]  But in turn, we have so many thousands of people.
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:51.680]  The CDC was incompetent.
[1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:53.680]  HHS was incompetent.
[1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:55.680]  You have all this incompetency around them.
[1:53:55.680 --> 1:53:57.680]  But where you're correct is this.
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:53:59.680]  I go back to just my personal experience.
[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:02.680]  Six years ago, my uncle loved him so much.
[1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:04.680]  My dad's uncle loved him so much.
[1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:11.680]  My cousin, we have a big ranch in East Texas that bought it from the Mexicans 200 years ago or whatever.
[1:54:11.680 --> 1:54:13.680]  They all die in a month.
[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:15.680]  And the doctors are like, man, this is a bad pneumonia.
[1:54:15.680 --> 1:54:16.680]  It's SARS-like.
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:17.680]  It's a cover-up.
[1:54:17.680 --> 1:54:18.680]  But they're all dead.
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:19.680]  That wasn't on the news.
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:22.680]  If there's a real bio attack, you don't hear about it, my experience.
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:25.680]  Because the doctors told me they were like wheeling dead people out while I was there.
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:27.680]  They're like, man, these people die in every hour here.
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:29.680]  That was in Palestine, Texas.
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:35.680]  So my point is, why is there this hype, Dr. Pachennick?
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:36.680]  Why is there so much hype?
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:41.680]  If you have mass debt before that I've personally seen, and there's no news coverage,
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:45.680]  and people are dying everywhere of a pneumonia thing, and now this is being hyped, what's behind it?
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:47.680]  Who's driving the hype?
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:52.680]  Well, number one, it's ignorance, media exposure.
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:54.680]  The New York Times does what it does.
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:56.680]  It'll give you all kinds of fake news.
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:55:00.680]  But the reality is CDC is so dysfunctional.
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:09.680]  I would say there are a month and a half behind the number of cases that we have in a small town in northern Florida
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:13.680]  where it's basically rednecks, workers, and all.
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:18.680]  And we've had an immense amount of the virus infection.
[1:55:18.680 --> 1:55:20.680]  And CDC doesn't even know about it.
[1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:23.680]  They talked about the first case was in Washington State.
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:25.680]  You said that a month ago exclusively.
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:26.680]  I've got to give you credit.
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:28.680]  They admit now they're not even allowing testing.
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:30.680]  It's not a competence.
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:32.680]  They're not allowing the testing.
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:34.680]  They're totally incompetent.
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:36.680]  Trust me, they're just incompetent.
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:38.680]  When you're incompetent, you really do nothing.
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:44.680]  I mean, the best thing to do is get out of the way and basically stand and do nothing.
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:46.680]  You've got to get rid of the CDC.
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:48.680]  You've got to get rid of HHS.
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:50.680]  This is where the problems lie in the federal government.
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:52.680]  I go back to the local government.
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:54.680]  What's more important to me?
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:58.680]  Well, I counted the number of cases I have in a town of two to 3,000,
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:03.680]  and I said about 30% of them had been sick over this past month.
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:04.680]  CDC doesn't record it.
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:06.680]  They don't even know where to go.
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:07.680]  Listen, I know my whole office.
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:09.680]  Half the people here have had respiratory stuff for months.
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:10.680]  Right.
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:11.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:12.680]  So I see it.
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:15.680]  So what you're saying is, it's not that local's God,
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:18.680]  but locals were the real rubber meets the road where you got to do stuff
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:23.680]  versus the delusional ivory tower, cloud city stuff.
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:24.680]  Exactly.
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:28.680]  I mean, what you're seeing is, again, it's the end of the ivory tower.
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:33.680]  The universities can no longer accommodate to the reality of a binary system
[1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:35.680]  or quantum corruption.
[1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:38.680]  We're not sending kids anymore to universities to say,
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:40.680]  you're going to get a liberal education.
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:46.680]  The MITs, the harvests that I went to were compromised by the Epstein's,
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:50.680]  by the CIA, by our incompetency and money.
[1:56:50.680 --> 1:56:56.680]  And my point to you is that you're seeing those changes evolve very quickly.
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:00.680]  And it's somebody like you on the alternative media that can state that.
[1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:03.680]  Now, Stuart and I come out of Montana.
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:05.680]  I know a little bit about him.
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:10.680]  And I had a lawyer who was disbarred from Montana and came down to Florida.
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:12.680]  Now, why is Montana a problem?
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:16.680]  Montana in and of itself was really a democratic state left-wing.
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:21.680]  And I was totally shocked because I had come up there and worked in Bozeman
[1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:22.680]  to start up companies.
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:26.680]  But when my accountant told me, look, at the local level,
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:28.680]  you're going to be paying all kinds of taxes.
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:29.680]  I said, it's not worth it.
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:30.680]  I'm getting out of here.
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:31.680]  Stay there.
[1:57:31.680 --> 1:57:32.680]  We're back in two minutes.

[2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:37.520]  Let's talk about that right now.
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:46.520]  You know, it's a paradox that we don't want to hype this thing too much up in our economy,
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:51.240]  but we don't want to get caught flat-footed.
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:57.220]  Exclusive Chinese doctors say Wuhan coronavirus, reinfection even deadlier, we'll get in those
[2:00:57.220 --> 2:01:02.920]  articles in a moment with Sir at Roads, but regardless, we kept asking after the failed
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:07.320]  impeachment, after the failed indictment and all of it.
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:09.320]  Well, then that's to attack me.
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:11.920]  And now it's this.
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:17.440]  So Dr. Steve Pachinic, what are your predictions about what's coming in the future?
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:19.720]  Number one, Trump will win.
[2:01:19.720 --> 2:01:25.160]  Number two, there'll be a realignment of the entire Democratic Party and he will probably
[2:01:25.160 --> 2:01:31.240]  get rid of Pence and a group of other people within his administration once he's back in.
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:37.800]  The coronavirus will spread and within a month to two months, it'll be over.
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:42.080]  And then in a year, we will have a vaccine that may or may not work.
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:46.280]  I'm not a great believer in these vaccines against the flu.
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:50.720]  So for me, if you're going to have it one way or the other, so you might as well be
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:57.240]  prepared, as you said, in terms of your own immunity system, get it in the best of shape.
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:02:01.720]  If you're a smoker, stop smoking, if you're drinking, this is not going to help.
[2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:07.320]  So basically, you're going to have a pandemic, it'll be over in a month and a half and there's
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:11.880]  very little this government can do or will do, they're dysfunctional.
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:15.680]  You have too big a system that doesn't work and we've said it for years.
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:20.920]  Now you're seeing that, you see the end of the Democrats, you see the end of the Republicans.
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:26.320]  And what you're going to see is the rise of the minority and the millennials pretty much.
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:30.280]  And that's not going to be relevant to our system.
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:32.760]  So this is epic stuff though.
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:35.200]  I mean, what do you see as the...
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:37.360]  Go ahead, Mark.
[2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:40.080]  You know, I got a 2.2 million army.
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:41.600]  Most of them are not well trained.
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:44.000]  I can't rely on most of my generals.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:48.680]  I've got generals who have combat flags that they were in Panama.
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:52.480]  I was in Panama with Noriega or they had a Grenada combat flag.
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:55.600]  In other words, I've got a military that's dysfunctional.
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:02:59.360]  I've got 16 intelligence units that are worthless.
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:02.040]  They all want to have their own little job.
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:06.320]  But when I need an integrated intelligence prediction, it doesn't work.
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:10.560]  The CIA doesn't work, the NSA doesn't work, cyber communication...
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:14.040]  By the way, we're not bragging, but is it info wars with all our guests?
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:18.280]  We've been giving the real integrated intelligence analysis.
[2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:22.240]  I said that for 18 years, you've been ahead of the curve.
[2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:23.240]  I mean, honestly...
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:25.680]  But I'm not even trying to toot our horn.
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:28.880]  It's scary that we saw Trump was going to win two years before he did.
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:30.880]  And that half his support was...
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:34.680]  I mean, the globalists are like, they don't even get what's going on.
[2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:35.680]  Blinders.
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:37.680]  What do you say?
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:38.680]  Blinders.
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:40.600]  Well, they're not only...
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:45.760]  Look, you've got to remember something and I've got to make it clear to people.
[2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:47.800]  You've got Soros, all right?
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:51.560]  When I was in the Council on Foreign Relations, he was there.
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:55.480]  When I was in the Soviet Union in the 70s, he was there.
[2:03:55.480 --> 2:03:59.800]  So what I'm getting to the audience is you don't have somebody who's just left-wing
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:01.640]  and giving money.
[2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:06.240]  You've got an underlying and intelligence system that plays on both sides.
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:08.680]  That's what I'm trying to say to both of you.
[2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:10.900]  It's not an issue of either or.
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:15.040]  From our point of view in the very deep state, we play both sides.
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:17.000]  The Soros belongs to that.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.760]  He was there with Saharov.
[2:04:18.760 --> 2:04:21.040]  I don't agree with other things he did.
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:23.200]  I don't get along with him, but that's not relevant.
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:30.280]  My point is he is part of an institution that's far deeper than anybody talked about.
[2:04:30.280 --> 2:04:35.960]  It's not part of the Constitution, but don't kid yourself that the intelligence system
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:41.160]  isn't working on both sides or all sides, and nobody's accountable, as you saw in the
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:42.160]  interview.
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:43.160]  Back in 60 seconds, let's talk about that.
[2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:47.400]  I get the Hegelian dialectic, but what about the straight shot?
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:50.520]  That's my dialectic, just 100 percent this is it.
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:55.600]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:55.600 --> 2:04:59.560]  It's really smart to get high-quality, storeable food at infowarstore.com.

[2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:21.160]  I'm here to ask you for your help.
[2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:24.560]  Where I come from, you don't get far unless you ask.
[2:06:24.560 --> 2:06:25.560]  My name's Joe Biden.
[2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:28.920]  I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.
[2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:29.920]  Look me over.
[2:06:29.920 --> 2:06:33.880]  If you'd like to see help out, if not both the other by, give me a look, though, okay?
[2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:39.000]  Look, tomorrow is Superstar Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  By the way, this is my little sister Valerie, and I'm Jill's husband.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  Oh, no, this is not.
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  Oh, you switched on me.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  This is my wife.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  This is my sister.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  They switched on me.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:07:00.080]  Poor kids are just as bright and just as tall as white kids.
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:02.800]  I sit on the stand, and it get hot.
[2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:05.160]  I got a lot of, I got hairy legs.
[2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:12.040]  It turned, that turned blonde in the sun.
[2:07:12.040 --> 2:07:14.280]  Why in tech stand?
[2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:15.280]  Why?
[2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:16.280]  Wait, wait, you're getting nervous, man.
[2:07:16.280 --> 2:07:17.280]  Calm down.
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:18.280]  It's okay.
[2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:23.680]  3,900 of them, right here in the state of North South Carolina.
[2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:25.960]  Give me a break.
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:31.440]  Anybody who can throw coal into a furnace can learn how to program, for God's sake.
[2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:32.440]  1.2 billion.
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:37.160]  So you go ahead and you stack spaghetti sauce at a store and in a supermarket.
[2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:44.080]  You control the guy or the woman who runs the, runs, brings out the carts on a forklift.
[2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:48.220]  I'm looking forward to appointing the first African-American woman to the United States
[2:07:48.220 --> 2:07:49.220]  Senate.
[2:07:49.220 --> 2:07:57.560]  A hundred and fifty million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt
[2:07:57.560 --> 2:07:59.440]  the gun manufacturers from life.
[2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:17.200]  I had two cranial aneurysms and they literally had to take the top of my head off.
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:23.680]  I mean they take a saw and they cut your head off and go in to find the artery that is one
[2:08:23.680 --> 2:08:28.200]  was leaking the other that hadn't before it burst.
[2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:33.200]  It was on cancer, Alzheimer's and as well as diabetes.
[2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:39.360]  Ladies and gentlemen and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down
[2:08:39.360 --> 2:08:44.000]  so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  They look at it.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  So I learned about roaches.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  I learned about kids jumping on my lap and I've loved kids jumping on my lap.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  We've got Dr. Steve Pachennick who's run major in women's asylum.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.840]  Dr. Pachennick, what do you make of that compilation of just some of the gaffes of Joe Biden?
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:11.240]  I mean, I don't know what you mean here, but it's like an alternate dimension, although
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:16.080]  the Democrats front runner is literally in late stage dementia on the stage.
[2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:18.200]  Where does this go?
[2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:22.060]  This goes seriously downhill from here.
[2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:23.560]  He cannot even serve.
[2:09:23.560 --> 2:09:30.600]  I mean, on a simple basis of a medical exam, there is in one doctor and I was a board examiner
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:36.160]  who can clear him for mental status that he knows where he is, what the time is and where
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:37.160]  he's going.
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:40.960]  I mean, it's it's sad, but there's no way he's going to become president.
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:43.480]  No, I mean, so how are they still pushing him?
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:45.880]  How is he the front runner?
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:51.600]  Because the sense of the self, what happened when they came in, when Michael Bloomberg
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:54.840]  came in and tried to buy the election.
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:10:00.000]  The only thing that was left to any of these people who had already screwed themselves
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:05.400]  in the impeachment said was the fact that we're going to have, quote, a moderate candidate
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:08.800]  as opposed to a more lucid socialist.
[2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:13.080]  But on the other hand, he's now he is medically impaired as well.
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:19.320]  By the way, I see you laughing, Bloomberg did Mary Poppins things and things as a little
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:24.600]  mermaid and he did add saying, I will tell you how to live America, I'm coming to run
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:25.600]  your life.
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:30.760]  That's like, that's like archetypally how you would like someone not vote for you.
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:35.400]  These people, you say, I agree, Bloomberg, he shakes dog's faces, he like sticks his
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:40.320]  fingers in in like buffets and licks them and sticks them back in it.
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:45.200]  But do you have to be completely mentally ill to have $78 million?
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:51.200]  Well, I've known about Bloomberg for over 30 years.
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:55.560]  Basically he's an ambitious man who became restless.
[2:10:55.560 --> 2:10:56.800]  He didn't know what to do.
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:10:57.800]  He made his money.
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:00.120]  I'm not sure it was worth all that money.
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:05.160]  But nevertheless, he went on to become mayor and he did a fair job as a mayor.
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:06.160]  I can't criticize.
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:07.160]  Absolutely gross.
[2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:18.160]  So we have Bloomberg smashing in the background.
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:21.000]  I mean, you hit it on the head.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:24.040]  There's nothing I can say to the man.
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:30.120]  He just spent to imagine you show up at people's house to impress them and there's like above
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:37.400]  a fan, you stick your hands at the main thing go out and it's a freaking space alien.
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:38.720]  You know what?
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:41.880]  This is the most expensive comedy show I've ever seen.
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:44.080]  No, I agree.
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:45.080]  It's so unreal.
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:46.880]  I think this may be a simulation now.
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:52.000]  In fact, how do you watch the phenomenon where you're so cold, you're on crazy people
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.680]  and you go crazy because I think I'm going crazy.
[2:11:55.680 --> 2:11:56.680]  You know what?
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:01.200]  You left the field because after a while, you just, you know, you don't tolerate what
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:03.000]  comes on.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.520]  These guys are so narcissistic.
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:11.400]  You got to understand the notion of eye for this individual, man or woman or transgender
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:12.900]  is so great.
[2:12:12.900 --> 2:12:14.160]  They don't know reality.
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:16.280]  They couldn't care about reality.
[2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:20.720]  So they live in Disneyland, which is in Washington.
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:25.920]  They live in Disneyland, which is Congress or the Senate and they do nothing.
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:29.920]  It's all process and they voted $8 billion now.
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:36.000]  Where are you going to spend $8 billion in what masks in hazmat suits?
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.440]  I don't even know where you're going to put eight billion.
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:42.960]  So the point of fact, exactly the factory's game produce that the next month.
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:43.960]  That's my point.
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:47.640]  But basically you have a system that is so dysfunctional.
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:51.560]  It's obvious and people are just basically saying, forget it.
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:53.520]  I'm working at the local level.
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:54.920]  I'm working with my cops.
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:56.480]  I'm working with the fire department.
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:12:58.200]  I don't like the Greek gods.
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:01.200]  Once people forgot them, they had no more power.
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:02.200]  You got.
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:03.200]  Oh, that's a good analogy.
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:04.200]  That's excellent.
[2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:05.200]  Actually.
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:06.200]  Yeah.
[2:13:06.200 --> 2:13:07.200]  Very good.
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:08.200]  So what comes next?
[2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:09.200]  What?
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:10.200]  What do you expect?
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:11.200]  Because they're not going to give up here.
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:12.200]  What's the next?
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:13.200]  Like tantrum.
[2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:17.360]  Well, you know, you hit something when you said about the Greek gods, there's an old
[2:13:17.360 --> 2:13:23.080]  saying that Mao Zedong said, the higher the monkey goes, the further he falls.
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:27.400]  So you're going to see the Democratic Party really tumbled down.
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:29.760]  You're going to see all kinds of accusations.
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:33.560]  You're going to see all kinds of day new mall.
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:37.840]  You're going to see a catastrophe, you know, basically a drama show, a comedy drama show
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:40.440]  on the Democratic Party.
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:48.080]  And Trump is going to tweet his heart off and say, OK, let's work with Biden's senile.
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:53.040]  Let's work with Bernie, the millionaire socialist, and he'll have a ball.
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:59.360]  Bernie Trump will come in and from that point on, I predict we're going to have a devolution
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:02.160]  of serious power from that point on.
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:06.200]  And people will really not be interested anymore on the federal level.
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:07.200]  No, I agree.
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:15.000]  When you're reigning, lobotomized monkeys, it's still dangerous, though, because I mean,
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:18.160]  I don't even, I'm not an elitist thinking I'm smart, but I look at these people, they're
[2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:19.160]  like crazy people.
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.560]  I mean, I'm like, what the hell is going on?
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:27.040]  When you said lobotomized monkeys, I mean, that's a, that's a heck of a metaphor.
[2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:29.240]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[2:14:29.240 --> 2:14:31.840]  Jump in any time you want, Stuart.
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:35.440]  Yeah, doctor, I was, what about the theory, though, that or my theory, actually, that
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:37.640]  that all all Biden is a placeholder?
[2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:42.240]  He's intentionally incompetent that when he's in and Hillary's the vice president, they
[2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:43.240]  can use the 25th amendment.
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:44.240]  Here's Biden serving.
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:46.920]  They can use the 25th amendment to get rid of him.
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:47.920]  Oh, I'm going.
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:48.920]  Hillary in.
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:53.760]  You know what, it's an interesting theory, but I think it's as much of a theory as you
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:14:59.760]  can do because if Hillary comes in the Republican, you know, there'll be a massive protest to
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:02.320]  the degree that you'll see violence on the street.
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:07.280]  So from a point of view that you said, yeah, and say, well, we call it heuristic concept.
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:12.000]  I wouldn't disagree with it, but the reality is I don't think even Hillary would accept
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:15.440]  that Biden is anywhere near competent.
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:19.520]  And basically, whenever she's going to get rid of him, that's not going to work.
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:23.280]  I mean, those days in the Constitution, let's come back one more second, you'll continue
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:24.280]  on with us to her.
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:26.800]  And we got one more second with Dr. Steven Chenning.
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:28.400]  How do we lose this though?
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:33.040]  Because like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, we shouldn't start celebrating quite yet.
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:37.600]  We should look at the curveballs here, so we said, so we shouldn't start sucking each
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:38.600]  other's yet.
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:47.440]  The point is a family show will be right on the other side.
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:49.080]  There'll be time for that later, Stuart.
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  No, no, there won't.
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:51.080]  That's a joke.
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:54.200]  Okay, you made the joke.
[2:15:54.200 --> 2:15:57.240]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[2:15:57.240 --> 2:16:02.560]  So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company selling your data

[2:17:52.240 --> 2:18:04.520]  Alex Tate, I just want to say it's great to be back once again and I've never gotten
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:06.840]  to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:11.080]  So that's Super Blue Florid Free Toothpaste and that Super Blue Whitening Toothpaste is
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:12.080]  on another level.
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:16.560]  I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into
[2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:17.560]  your gum.
[2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:20.000]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.840]  I literally just took a turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:27.480]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better
[2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:31.320]  than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life, so I just
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:32.320]  want to get that out of the way.
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:36.520]  Support this man, everything that he exposed, nobody knew about Bohemian Grove, nobody knew
[2:18:36.520 --> 2:18:42.160]  about FD, nobody knew about Bilderberg, nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[2:18:42.160 --> 2:18:43.160]  Go look it up yourself.
[2:18:43.160 --> 2:18:44.160]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:47.080]  They definitely want us off the air without you or not here, but yeah, these are all
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:54.840]  great products, so thank you, sir.
[2:18:54.840 --> 2:19:00.720]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:05.800]  all the work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving in to sickness care,
[2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:09.440]  take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:14.320]  vitality and I say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:19.040]  being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack that
[2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:24.520]  they have, the AMPM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I
[2:19:24.520 --> 2:19:27.240]  have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[2:19:27.240 --> 2:19:31.440]  I just want to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that beyond
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:35.320]  the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:41.480]  great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:47.640]  that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose for our
[2:19:47.640 --> 2:19:52.240]  families and for our communities and right now, folks who are willing to think like we
[2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:58.040]  do are critical to the future of America.
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:15.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:15.040 --> 2:20:42.160]  We're listening to the Republic from Enemies, Born and Domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:49.440]  No two rebirth of the Republic but yeah, Biden is a placeholder because the fact that they're
[2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:55.680]  pushing him means whoever he makes his VP is who he will then step down if he wins.
[2:20:55.680 --> 2:21:01.680]  So that's clearly the play to run somebody who's this adult, this clearly in the middle
[2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:03.360]  stages of dementia maybe even worse.
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:21.440]  I think the entire Democratic field was just Kabuki Theater and Hillary's the actual candidate
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:26.200]  and they're just waiting for all that dust to settle and then she'll come in as his VP
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:30.320]  and then she will be president when he's declared incompetent once he's sworn in.
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:34.720]  By the way, we were all saying this years ago, now you're predicting it, now they float
[2:21:34.720 --> 2:21:35.720]  it all the time.
[2:21:35.720 --> 2:21:38.000]  Yeah, well they've been doing it to Trump, right?
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:41.840]  Trump is incompetent, Trump should be declared incompetent on the 25th Amendment, so when
[2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:46.400]  Biden gets in and is clearly incompetent, the right will clamor for him to be declared
[2:21:46.400 --> 2:21:49.480]  incompetent and they'll say, you know what, you're right that Hillary's the president.
[2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:52.440]  God is pretending aside from the fact that Hillary Clinton is probably more beautiful
[2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:59.040]  than Marilyn Monroe, no, no, seriously, as a reanimated corpse, she's very sexy, I love
[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:04.120]  the zombies, I like her, but seriously, what do you think, because obviously she's delusional,
[2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:07.080]  I don't see she'll even get away with that, but she's definitely thinking, what do you
[2:22:07.080 --> 2:22:09.920]  think is going on?
[2:22:09.920 --> 2:22:14.160]  We talked about Hillary a couple of years ago and she was tripping and falling all over
[2:22:14.160 --> 2:22:17.840]  the place, she had her own problems, mentally and physically.
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:23.080]  I think it's an interesting scenario, I think Stuart may be right, but the reality is I don't
[2:22:23.080 --> 2:22:27.160]  think the Democrats have a prayer of a chance to get in.
[2:22:27.160 --> 2:22:30.600]  And basically, this is pretty much the end of the Democratic Party.
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:35.160]  Speak to that because you're not just saying it, I mean, you can smell the death and then
[2:22:35.160 --> 2:22:39.360]  let's back away, not to violate the Goldwater rule, but just as a psychiatrist and a smart
[2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:43.520]  guy that ran black ops for the U.S. government, Trump is a magnificent creature.
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:48.120]  I mean, he's had his problems, but he just gets stronger under attack, so speak to the
[2:22:48.120 --> 2:22:53.160]  Democratic Party's death and then Trump, who this guy is.
[2:22:53.160 --> 2:22:59.080]  Now, the beginnings of all of this was when Nancy Pelosi decided on her own to go up against
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:07.120]  Trump and the paramount activity for Nancy, where I said she was highly self-destructive,
[2:23:07.120 --> 2:23:11.840]  she herself has a problem, mentally and physically.
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:16.280]  She now has a candidate for the first time in 40 years to run against her in the Pacific
[2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:24.840]  Palisades, but basically, what I was saying with Nancy, once she tore up that piece of
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:28.880]  paper, that was the end of a whole era.
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:34.240]  And Nancy, the Bidens, all of those, the Clintons, they're finished.
[2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:36.120]  The Bushes are finished.
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:38.800]  The Bush Jr. now didn't get elected.
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:43.920]  That's the first time in 30 or 40 years that a Bush has never been elected in a local election.
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:49.120]  So what I'm predicting is the end of the political parties as we know them now.
[2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:51.680]  Trump is unique for the very simple reason.
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:57.680]  This is the first time we've had a businessman who really has accomplished what he has accomplished.
[2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:01.680]  And I was there in New York, New Jersey, everywhere in Florida.
[2:24:01.680 --> 2:24:04.240]  He's not perfect, but he's like a space alien to them.
[2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:05.240]  He's not part of the swamp.
[2:24:05.240 --> 2:24:07.600]  They don't even know how to read him.
[2:24:07.600 --> 2:24:08.600]  Exactly.
[2:24:08.600 --> 2:24:12.240]  And what he uses was exactly what you and I were talking about.
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:15.800]  But sometimes what you create and I create, and that is chaos.
[2:24:15.800 --> 2:24:21.160]  He knows how to use that Twitter to create chaos within the system, and people don't
[2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:22.160]  know how to respond.
[2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.160]  That's what's changed by the left.
[2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:25.760]  They don't even get to kill a bad story and create a new one.
[2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:30.120]  They just, what is this thing where they hammer the same stories over and over again for like
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:31.120]  10 years?
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:32.400]  It's, no one listens to it.
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:37.080]  It's like, but they just do it like, eh, eh, eh, eh, the same story over and over again.
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:39.920]  But there's a reason why they're not on the air, and you are my friend.
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:46.640]  And the reality is they don't have your ability to improvise, to talk, to be able to be funny.
[2:24:46.640 --> 2:24:52.320]  I mean, I mean, it's seriously, when you have a one note orchestra, that's it.
[2:24:52.320 --> 2:24:53.320]  Nobody's going to listen.
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:54.320]  It's finished.
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:55.320]  They know that.
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:24:56.320]  We know that.
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:24:58.080]  It's just playing out now.
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:04.920]  The death of this party and the death of a system that really is no longer in the constitutional
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:05.920]  system.
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:06.920]  I totally, you're right.
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:07.920]  You predicted it 10 years ago.
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:11.000]  You show how do they go down, and I don't want to be like Gandalf up here.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:12.320]  The Bull Rock falls off the cliff.
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:13.840]  He gets me with his whip.
[2:25:13.840 --> 2:25:17.360]  How do we stop them from taking us down with them?
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:18.640]  You don't do anything with them.
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:23.320]  It's basically like a patient committing suicide, what I call the borderline.
[2:25:23.320 --> 2:25:26.000]  Every time they want to cut their wrists, I let them cut their wrists.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:29.200]  If they want to keep cutting their wrists, they do it in front of me, and I said, fine,
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:30.680]  I'm not going to stop you.
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:35.120]  Why would I, as a psychiatrist, want to stop yourself destructive of behavior?
[2:25:35.120 --> 2:25:39.520]  As an operational intel officer, I would encourage it and say, you know what?
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:40.960]  I really don't care.
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:44.360]  Go ahead and keep doing it, because that's exactly what Nancy did.
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:49.240]  That's exactly what Biden is doing, and you want to encourage that, and that's what Trump
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:50.240]  is really doing.
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:52.200]  He's saying, OK, now bring in your next...
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:55.720]  He baits them into destroying themselves quicker because it's better to get rid of them
[2:25:55.720 --> 2:25:56.720]  quickly.
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:25:57.720]  Exactly.
[2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:00.240]  And he understands how to do that because he's done it in business.
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:01.720]  He's done it in politics.
[2:26:01.720 --> 2:26:07.400]  He's pulling out of an 18-year fiasco created by none other than Cheney and Bush...
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:09.600]  And by the way, you're not just a Trump lover.
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:12.400]  You were super mad at him a few years ago when he was doing Make the Wrong Move.
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.920]  He warmed about the neocons, but isn't it great to see him actually pulling out of these
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:16.920]  wars?
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:17.920]  Isn't that amazing?
[2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:19.560]  It is amazing, but you know why?
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.280]  I say it again.
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:26.600]  With all due respect, he listens to you, and he understands what this is about, and he
[2:26:26.600 --> 2:26:31.160]  understood from the very beginning that we're here not to flatter him.
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:33.520]  We're here to do a reality testing.
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:36.600]  Reality testing in politics is not easy.
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:37.600]  So you can't do it...
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:38.600]  No, he doesn't need...
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:39.600]  Yes, man.
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:40.600]  He needs people to challenge him.
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:41.600]  Correct.
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:42.600]  And that's what he likes.
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:45.480]  I think Hope Hicks was brought back in.
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:46.480]  He likes her.
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:49.720]  She's attractive, but she's a reality tester for him.
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:51.440]  Even Ivanka is a reality tester.
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:55.680]  Jared Kushner, who I thought once was deficient, really has become a real...
[2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:59.320]  Trump doesn't like people to challenge him just on an ego basis, but if you're really
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:01.480]  telling him something, that's what they...
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:02.480]  I'm not bragging.
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:04.160]  They hate me so much, because I tell Trump stuff.
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:05.160]  It's real.
[2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:06.480]  It's not from a point of like, I'm better than him.
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:07.800]  Like, sir, you need to look at this, right?
[2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:09.680]  And he listens.
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:15.280]  Not only listens, but he respects you and others because you're willing to stand up to him.
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:17.680]  That's an important dynamic for Trump.
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:22.560]  He knows he likes to intimidate people, but beneath that, he wants to be liked.
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:28.960]  And quite frankly, the need to be liked is far more important to him than in the intimidation.
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:33.800]  So once he likes somebody, he'll say, oh, my good friend Abe, or my good friend G, or
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:34.800]  my good friend...
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:35.800]  Well, I see him trying to intimidate people.
[2:27:35.800 --> 2:27:37.080]  He thinks he's trying to intimidate him.
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:39.520]  Well, it's even more than that.
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:42.960]  He's used to intimidating, and he wants to see how you react to it.
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:48.640]  If you don't react to it and you know how to bypass him and use a joke, he respects you.
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:52.760]  If you count out to him, he's going to use you, but then he's going to deprecate you.
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:56.200]  That's exactly what Roger Stone told me, because one time in front of Roger, I had a phone
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:27:59.360]  call for like 15 minutes with the president, and he goes, listen, he doesn't like that
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:00.360]  you're being too nice.
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:01.360]  You need to be man to man.
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:02.360]  I said, okay.
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:03.360]  I was just...
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:05.360]  Roger's absolutely right, though, about that.
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:07.360]  No, Roger was correct.
[2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:11.680]  And one of the things that really got me angry is Roger Stone's going to go to prison, give
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:15.240]  me a break for seven years to do what?
[2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:16.600]  He's never bothered anybody.
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:23.280]  You got the Sacklers who killed 250,000 people with their drugs, oxycontin, and created
[2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:25.280]  two million heroin addicts.
[2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:28.120]  They ought to be executed.
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:29.120]  There you are.
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:31.640]  Dr. Pachennick, you couldn't come on last week.
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:34.320]  Come back again with us very, very soon.
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:35.320]  We love you, Steve Pachennick.com.
[2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:36.320]  Thank you.
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:37.320]  I love you.
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:38.320]  Take care.
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:39.320]  Always informative.
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:44.280]  And now we're going to take over with Stuart Rhodes and his colonel buddy, who I've seen
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:48.120]  on the show before, who's a really smart guy and has some inside intel and needs to
[2:28:48.120 --> 2:28:49.120]  be involved in COG.
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:56.120]  Say what COG is if you don't know straight ahead.
[2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:23.960]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:27.720]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:32.080]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:32.080 --> 2:29:33.440]  So here's what you should do right now.
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:37.720]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:43.680]  That's myownpowergrid.com, over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses
[2:29:43.680 --> 2:29:44.680]  too.

[2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:48.320]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:51.080]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:51.080 --> 2:29:56.440]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:56.440 --> 2:29:59.560]  This should really be easier than it is.
[2:29:59.560 --> 2:30:01.680]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[2:30:01.680 --> 2:30:04.400]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:09.880]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try
[2:30:09.880 --> 2:30:13.360]  them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:19.800]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and
[2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:20.960]  it's symbiotic.
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:26.400]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:27.720]  the bad halogen.
[2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:32.600]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[2:30:32.600 --> 2:30:39.880]  I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:45.640]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you

[2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:10.200]  the body.
[2:31:10.200 --> 2:31:13.480]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.

[2:31:52.520 --> 2:31:53.520]  InfoWarStore.com.
[2:31:53.520 --> 2:31:58.680]  Everybody needs food, I'm proud we're selling high quality food, elections, globalism, the
[2:31:58.680 --> 2:32:02.680]  economy, the bubble, this is something you need on your checklist to have done, but for
[2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:08.640]  me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and I had long discussions this
[2:32:08.640 --> 2:32:11.760]  morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels
[2:32:11.760 --> 2:32:15.560]  of this, right down to the folks who run the plants to get the best idea we have, but they
[2:32:15.560 --> 2:32:19.800]  want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed, but understand
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:25.080]  the last food company, the biggest food company, is now at hundreds of times their regular order
[2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:29.480]  and they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next
[2:32:29.480 --> 2:32:33.080]  week and at a certain point just saying we're done because people are going to take food
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:34.240]  orders out 10 weeks.
[2:32:34.240 --> 2:32:37.720]  We don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes
[2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:41.440]  with that because we're honest, under promise, over delivered, but technically it's going
[2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:44.840]  to be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care
[2:32:44.840 --> 2:32:49.440]  of you so you come back again, we want relationships with you, we're not Satanists, we're the opposite,
[2:32:49.440 --> 2:32:53.520]  we don't screw people over, we believe in Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you,
[2:32:53.520 --> 2:32:58.120]  we're all in this together.
[2:32:58.120 --> 2:33:15.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:15.200 --> 2:33:20.440]  You know people ask me all the time on the street and in emails and comments, why do
[2:33:20.440 --> 2:33:24.720]  you have one guest on this, here's another guest, why do you say one take one hour, another
[2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:28.760]  hour, well no, I'm always for the Second Amendment and I'm always for the family and Jesus Christ
[2:33:28.760 --> 2:33:33.760]  and First Amendment and I'm always for America, but I'm not a cult.
[2:33:33.760 --> 2:33:37.800]  I want to have different perspectives on the different angles to challenge my mind.
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:40.960]  Google, you know, it's always trying to be like your own little group and feed you what
[2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:41.960]  you want to hear.
[2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:42.960]  No, I don't want that.
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:46.400]  So, Stuart Rhodes is here and I've met him before he's been on the show when you co-hosted.
[2:33:46.400 --> 2:33:51.720]  John Seamus has retired Army Colonel, worked in COG, Continued Government, very secretive
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:52.720]  area.
[2:33:52.720 --> 2:33:55.800]  There's nothing classified here, but a lot of this is out in the open and so he's going
[2:33:55.800 --> 2:33:59.040]  to talk about it today and be able to get their secret declaration ready.
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:03.680]  It's already in place and so much more and you're not challenging Pachettic, we're not
[2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:04.680]  in a cult.
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:07.200]  He wants to make it all sound like it's great and everybody's okay, but Stuart, you've got
[2:34:07.200 --> 2:34:08.200]  some great points.
[2:34:08.200 --> 2:34:09.800]  You can see the setup of the president here.
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:10.800]  We should take this very seriously.
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:13.640]  Yeah, I think people are being way too complacent.
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:15.720]  We've got a deep state that's not going to give up.
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:19.800]  I mean, Trump was an anomaly caught him off guard, but as we've talked about before, you
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:23.360]  can expect the vote fraud to be extra heavy this time.
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:24.800]  Oh, Trump better not count his chickens.
[2:34:24.800 --> 2:34:28.480]  Yeah, they made a mistake and last time he was able to overwhelm the vote fraud.
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:29.960]  That element alone is a problem.
[2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:33.400]  You've got billions of illegal aliens are going to be set up to vote in Texas right
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:36.320]  here and in California and in Mexico.
[2:34:36.320 --> 2:34:38.400]  So this is all ground we've covered before.
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:40.640]  I think he's being way too complacent.
[2:34:40.640 --> 2:34:44.360]  And the other thing is, is that they will use this crisis, you know, whether it's real
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:45.360]  or not.
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:46.360]  I think it is real.
[2:34:46.360 --> 2:34:47.360]  They will use this to take Trump down.
[2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:48.360]  It would be blatant.
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:52.360]  It would be clear America is running the tables right now because it awoken.
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:53.400]  But you're absolutely right.
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:57.320]  If we don't worry about election fraud and other things, them trying to blame the coronavirus,
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:00.080]  which they're doing on Trump, we are missing a major blind spot.
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:01.080]  Yeah.
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:03.360]  So he needs to be decisive and do the right thing and the right thing would be to seal
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:05.920]  our borders right now and John Siemens.
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:06.920]  Tell us about John.
[2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:07.920]  He's got quite a background.
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:14.160]  So Colonel John Siemens is it was the fifth Army liaison to FEMA when he was in service
[2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:19.320]  spent 30 years of the U.S. military in the Army, and he worked on, in fact, he was on
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:20.320]  Oklahoma City.
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:22.760]  He's on the ground Oklahoma City after the Murrah bombing there.
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:27.720]  So he also worked on on a training National Guard State Commands.
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:32.480]  And part of the scenarios he worked on was was a mass hurricane coming across New Orleans,
[2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:37.440]  which was before FEMA, before Katrina, and as a result of that exercise, he determined
[2:35:37.440 --> 2:35:41.720]  that if we ever had a level five hurricane, it would be 30 feet of water in downtown New
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:42.720]  Orleans.
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:43.720]  And that's exactly what happened.
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:48.840]  So he's been there, done that your your your approximation of the coronavirus, Colonel.
[2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:52.600]  I think that it's a weapon of mass destruction first.
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:36:00.520]  I think it's something that China has released either on purpose or in an accident.
[2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:01.520]  I concur with that.
[2:36:01.520 --> 2:36:05.160]  It's very clear that it's I think it's very clear.
[2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:11.440]  They've got a problem and it may have been generated by some of the stuff that America
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:14.760]  has done in affecting their economy.
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:17.640]  They they're they're they're they're they're they're strike back.
[2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:20.840]  They are hurting and they they're a communist government.
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:23.240]  They cannot support their people.
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:24.960]  They can't take care of their people.
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:26.840]  They got to get rid of them.
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:31.240]  That's one of the possibilities when you're at their bubbles collapsing, they got to
[2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:32.240]  have a reset.
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:34.720]  Yeah, that's what the smart money says, Colonel.
[2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:39.120]  Yeah, but then they can use it also if they're in cahoots with anybody else.
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:45.520]  They can bring it down and use it as a a by a weapon against America and affect Trump
[2:36:45.520 --> 2:36:47.880]  because Trump's the guy that's hurting him.
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:53.800]  Well, I mean, you can see it in the U.N. in coordination Stuart to blame America for
[2:36:53.800 --> 2:36:54.800]  it.
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:55.800]  It's just crazy.
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:37:00.840]  What's the setup is don't do anything that will actually stop the spread of the virus.
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:02.560]  Let it spread throughout the world.
[2:37:02.560 --> 2:37:07.720]  Let it cause chaos and then use that for their purposes, which is which is always the same
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:12.760]  answer, which is more draconian central government and in particular in the United States take
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:13.760]  Trump down.
[2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:20.720]  But that's that's part of where we're going is the FEMA and the U.S. government in total
[2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:24.120]  has a responsibility to protect America.
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:26.160]  They're not doing that.
[2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:27.160]  They want to.
[2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:30.360]  So why why are they sending out bad kids or not sending out kids?
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:31.360]  I'm not blaming Trump.
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:33.960]  He's I can really run my own office and I got great crew.
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:35.400]  They were against me and be over.
[2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:38.880]  But clearly, the CDC, who are the culprits?
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:39.880]  You're an expert on this.
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:43.440]  Oh, I don't know that I'm the expert, but well, no, I mean, as much as anybody, I mean,
[2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:44.440]  you've been on the inside.
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:46.040]  Who is playing this down?
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:51.640]  Well, I think we've got a deep state problem in in there in the CDC as well as many other
[2:37:51.640 --> 2:37:57.040]  government agencies, and they like to look good and not do anything there.
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:02.320]  They're used to sitting on their bottoms.
[2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:06.240]  They want to throw money at a problem or throw it to somebody else.
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:07.240]  Oh, it's his problem.
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:08.240]  It's Trump's problem.
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:09.240]  No, it's our government.
[2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:13.400]  Well, I got a call by a Lieutenant Colonel on the Colonel like you, but in Army Special
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:18.240]  Operations said, Alex, we just want you to know we've been briefed that the projection
[2:38:18.240 --> 2:38:25.440]  is three million dead if the CDC prediction of two percent mortality is right.
[2:38:25.440 --> 2:38:26.440]  So we're preparing for that.
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:29.320]  And it's going to cause all sorts of supply chain and breakdown.
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:33.560]  And I might have another Lieutenant Colonel retired, but he was in Special Operations
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:34.560]  as well at my house.
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:39.040]  Just in a business thing we're doing with my wife and he, I've known the guy a while.
[2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:42.160]  He's telling her while I'm driving to work, I had to leave the same thing.
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:44.160]  He his buddy got a briefing her the same exact.
[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:47.560]  So I mean, this is like the Army's being told, get ready for three million dead.
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:49.200]  What have you guys heard from your sources, Turk?
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:51.240]  Well, we're seeing movement now.
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:57.000]  Like the one footage, maybe from the floor show the clip from the CBRM unit.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  That's a special operation.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:02.600]  It's a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear response unit, which is in each major
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:07.320]  FEMA region are dedicated units or national guard, but they're all full-time troops and
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:09.960]  they're integrated with special forces.
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:12.640]  And there's one on the move in Florida that someone's videotaped.
[2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:14.520]  Yeah, we had that about an hour ago.
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:15.640]  We'll see if we can roll that again.
[2:39:15.640 --> 2:39:18.440]  We're seeing increased activity like that across the country.
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:20.720]  More movement of military vehicles.
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:22.440]  And that's an entire military unit running down the road.
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:24.680]  But FEMA says they're getting ready to declare an actual emergency.
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:30.760]  Colonel, you were involved as a liaison with FEMA at a major national level.
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:31.960]  What does that signify?
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:35.200]  Well, it signifies, there's a problem.
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:40.760]  I wrote a lot of exercises for FEMA training state governments on how to handle national
[2:39:40.760 --> 2:39:41.760]  emergencies.
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:44.000]  That's been 20 years ago.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:51.560]  And those plans have lot basically been sitting on a shelf for most of that 20 years, percolating.
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:57.480]  They get revised every couple of years, and I'm not familiar with where they are now,
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:04.720]  but they certainly were in detail enough that they could use them to handle many different
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:05.720]  types of emergencies.
[2:40:05.720 --> 2:40:07.560]  Let me ask this question.
[2:40:07.560 --> 2:40:13.360]  Whether the virus is super spreadable or super deadly or not, China locking down its major
[2:40:13.360 --> 2:40:16.520]  cities and supply chain breakdowns, that's real.
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:21.640]  So why is China doing this to shut down the Taiwanese protesters?
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:26.760]  Well, I think they had no choice, but it also has, and there's a good example of a real
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:32.000]  crisis that has a side benefit for them of shutting down the ability of people in Hong
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.360]  Kong, for example, to protest.
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:39.440]  And the same thing in the United States, a lockdown in our country will stop the rise
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:40.520]  of these militia units.
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:44.800]  For example, in Virginia, no one's going to want to go to a mass muster of 500 guys like
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:45.800]  we just had.
[2:40:45.800 --> 2:40:49.320]  So it's a way to shut down the political awakening in America.
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:55.240]  We have to keep in mind that the state area commands, the state adjutant general is an
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:41:02.200]  appointee of the governor, and the governor controls that those army units, those National
[2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:09.240]  Guard units, until the president decides that, no, they're mine, that he activates them into
[2:41:09.240 --> 2:41:10.520]  federal service.
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:15.760]  So that's what the governor in Virginia has done, is use that state area command and
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:22.320]  their National Guard units in order to threaten the citizens of Virginia.
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:25.440]  And we can expect the same thing to happen in New Mexico and other places.
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:27.080]  Well, that's it.
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:33.440]  The Democrats have been trying to invoke martial law and a clash, but it's been failing.
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:34.680]  So what better way to do it?
[2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:39.400]  What better way to make it actually happen than to let the virus come in the United States,
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:45.120]  do the minimal amount to stop it, in fact, maybe help spread it, and then trick Trump
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.440]  into taking the steps that they want to see happen, which is quarantines inside the United
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:53.520]  States, setting the precedent so that when they come in for power, they can use those
[2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  precedents.
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:42:04.120]  Yeah, they're setting us up for them to be able to declare a national emergency, exactly.
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:07.120]  And then within that national emergency, how do they attack Trump?
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:10.000]  Well, he's blamed for it.
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:13.320]  You make it really bad, and then you say, he didn't do enough to stop this, now look
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:14.560]  at what's happening.
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:18.760]  And so therefore, we have to quarantine all the cities, and of course, the Virginia governor,
[2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:21.000]  for example, can use those powers.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.240]  And then that's the cover for removing Trump.
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:27.880]  Well, sure, they can say he's incompetent, or we'll just lose the election, because
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:29.040]  he could be blamed for it.
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:34.520]  It's a cover for them to blame Trump so that they can garner their votes and get Trump
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:35.520]  out of office.
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:40.560]  All right, final segment before our next guest host, Mike Adams, takes over.
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:45.360]  And boy, is he ready to cover a lot of critical stuff, both of our guests are here with us
[2:42:45.360 --> 2:42:46.360]  right now.
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:50.440]  I'm Alex Jones, John Siemens, retired Army Colonel involved with FEMA, and of course,
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:55.080]  Stuart Rhodes founder of Low Keeper Stoos.
[2:42:55.080 --> 2:42:56.080]  Real stuff, man.
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:57.080]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[2:42:57.080 --> 2:43:00.600]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:05.280]  tech people keep running rough shot over and everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:07.080]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:10.760]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:16.120]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:21.000]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowars.com.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.160]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[2:43:23.160 --> 2:43:27.000]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  even disrupting things.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:29.560]  People say, why are you doing this?
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:30.560]  What's happening?
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:31.560]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:33.800]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:36.560]  And Dr. Buchanig, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:37.560]  yet.
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:38.560]  It's brilliant.
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:43.600]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:45.040]  it into a weapon.
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:47.960]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:50.560]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:51.560]  Silence.
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:52.560]  Silence.
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:53.560]  Silence.
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:54.560]  Rich in Alabama.
[2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:55.560]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:43:56.560]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:57.560]  Appreciate it.
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:00.160]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:03.560]  I drive truck for a living and it's amazing.
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:08.560]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:10.560]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:16.040]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours.
[2:44:16.040 --> 2:44:21.000]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drink and coffee, and it's just, you know, at the end
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.560]  of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:25.560]  I'll, you know, knock out them.
[2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:26.560]  I'm out cold.
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:30.560]  Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it.
[2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:34.560]  And I said, what would the ultimate long, say 10 hour energy be?
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:35.560]  Is that possible?
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:39.560]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:41.560]  healthy and natural that are time released.
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:44.560]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:48.560]  So that's why turbo force has such a great effect.
[2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:49.560]  And so I really appreciate you.
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:54.560]  And I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[2:44:54.560 --> 2:44:59.560]  We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:01.560]  and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden.
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:03.560]  I mean, it's just what we're meant to do.
[2:45:03.560 --> 2:45:04.560]  It feels good when we do it.
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:06.560]  But we do so high quality, swarble food.
[2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:09.560]  I told my patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:10.560]  I said, I think it's going to be really big.
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:12.560]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:16.560]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:19.560]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:20.560]  the prices are going up for you.
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:22.560]  So those are the types of discussions we have.
[2:45:22.560 --> 2:45:24.560]  I'm just giving the inside base of all of this.
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:28.560]  This is a hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred times a few days ago.
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:29.560]  Now it's about 200 times.
[2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:33.560]  OK, infowarstore.com, you go right in the queue, first come, first served.
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:37.560]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra massive, it's dizzying.
[2:45:37.560 --> 2:45:38.560]  I mean, this is just insane.
[2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:41.560]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:46.560]  And then if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend good sales.
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:48.560]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food.
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:49.560]  But that's how big this is.
[2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:54.560]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on infowarstore.com.
[2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:58.560]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:02.560]  Humanities waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes,
[2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:04.560]  how they're building a post-human world.
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:06.560]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:11.560]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:17.560]  and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the west
[2:46:17.560 --> 2:46:22.560]  and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and pivot program.
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:28.560]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:30.560]  inner coronavirus.
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:36.560]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:39.560]  word because people are waking up like never before.
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:42.560]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck.
[2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:46.560]  So spread the word about band.video and infowars.com.
[2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:53.560]  That is so important. You are at the center of the resistance. You are our only hope.
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:20.560]  Because he's racing and racing and plotting the course.
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:23.560]  He's fighting and fighting and lighting on his horse.
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:25.560]  He's going the distance.
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:31.560]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:42.560]  So we know the bureaucratic deep state has been trying to bring down Trump and bring down
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:47.560]  this American resurgence. But there's a deep state that cooks breakfast for the children
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:52.560]  every morning and works in factories and ranches and schools and police departments and fire
[2:47:52.560 --> 2:47:55.560]  departments and other systems every day.
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:47:57.560]  And it's the American people.
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:03.560]  Stuart Rhodes is here with us, founder of Oath Keepers Army Veteran, constitutional lawyer,
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:07.560]  patriot, and John Siemens, retired colonel, who was the main liaison, one of the main
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:13.560]  FEMA regions, sevens with the entire federal government and COG, continent of government.
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:16.560]  So I want to ask this question to both of you.
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:20.560]  What would you call this time America is in right now?
[2:48:20.560 --> 2:48:23.560]  I see as a time we're trying to take control of our government again.
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:30.560]  We've had a lot of success, but we're not in the final leg of the victory.
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:32.560]  But I think we're almost over the top.
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:34.560]  We were over the top right now.
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:38.560]  This is a system going to strike back. And if we look at how Democrats operate, how they
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:43.560]  use every crisis to power grab and to leverage and how their blue cities operate and how
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:46.560]  they're salivating saying they're going to use the virus to blame Trump.
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:48.560]  What do you think is going to happen?
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:51.560]  Well, I would call it either 1774.
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:56.560]  It's about where we're at or the Second American Civil War is kind of where we're at.
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:00.560]  And we're fighting against, you know, the deep state that wants to overthrow our Constitution.
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:02.560]  Well, you're not just saying that. That's really where we are. Keep going.
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:06.560]  That's where we're at. And so I think a good scenario to walk through with the Colonel is,
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:12.560]  is take Washington State, for example, a sanctuary state for illegal aliens in Seattle,
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:14.560]  a sanctuary city for illegal aliens.
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:18.560]  And now we have a situation where they're experiencing an epidemic.
[2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:22.560]  So I can see this happening, that they will blame it on Trump,
[2:49:22.560 --> 2:49:28.560]  never talk about the fact that their open border mentality has helped spread the disease in their state,
[2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:30.560]  but they're going to blame it on Trump.
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:34.560]  Did you see the Democrat state rep that said get infected and go to a mega rally?
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:36.560]  Right, I saw that.
[2:49:36.560 --> 2:49:42.560]  So let's walk through a scenario of what happens if they then quarantine the city,
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:46.560]  and now the governor and the mayor get to be the heroes and say that we stepped into the right thing
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:48.560]  because Trump didn't do the right thing.
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:56.560]  Well, first off, they have been sitting there for months and even years denying the federal government
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:49:59.560]  to even come in and do something to take care of that problem.
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:04.560]  Trump has said he needs to go into San Francisco, for instance,
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:08.560]  and take care of the homeless filth problem there.
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:13.560]  But you get into something like this coronavirus in Seattle.
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:19.560]  What's going to happen is, you know, they've denied the federal government from taking care of anything
[2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:21.560]  despite what Trump may want to do.
[2:50:21.560 --> 2:50:26.560]  And then now they're going to step up, like Stuart just said, they want to step up
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:29.560]  and they'll start with small places that are quarantined.
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:32.560]  They're already quarantining individuals in homes.
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:38.560]  Well, now they're looking at a whole nursing home where they've had a lot of deaths
[2:50:38.560 --> 2:50:45.560]  and it will step up and slowly expand to where, as the coronavirus expands,
[2:50:45.560 --> 2:50:47.560]  they're going to quarantine a whole city.
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:50.560]  That's right, they're all starting to communist China, the globalist run system,
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:52.560]  to set the precedent to do it here.
[2:50:52.560 --> 2:50:56.560]  Right, and instead of, like I said before, instead of defending our borders
[2:50:56.560 --> 2:50:59.560]  and locking down our country and being that be the hardcore answer.
[2:50:59.560 --> 2:51:02.560]  As Papi Cannon said last week, then Trump wins regardless.
[2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:04.560]  He's done the default. Why isn't he doing it?
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:05.560]  He doesn't want to hurt the stock market.
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:07.560]  Well, he's also being given bad advice.
[2:51:07.560 --> 2:51:11.560]  He's let Pence take over and instead of him talking to...
[2:51:11.560 --> 2:51:14.560]  And that's one thing you and Pachena agree on, don't trust Pence.
[2:51:14.560 --> 2:51:19.560]  I kind of like Pence, but I know his background, but why is Pence Pence?
[2:51:19.560 --> 2:51:24.560]  Well, first of all, the most recent example is he's in fully in favor of red flag.
[2:51:24.560 --> 2:51:25.560]  He's wanting to send...
[2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:26.560]  Really?
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:27.560]  Oh yeah.
[2:51:27.560 --> 2:51:29.560]  He had a symposium in Indiana for red flags.
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:31.560]  Show my ignorance, he's for red flag? Wow.
[2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:32.560]  Yeah.
[2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:35.560]  He had a symposium in Indiana saying that the red flag legislation in Indiana
[2:51:35.560 --> 2:51:37.560]  is the model the whole country should follow.
[2:51:37.560 --> 2:51:40.560]  I saw some of that. Wow, he endorsed that.
[2:51:40.560 --> 2:51:42.560]  Wow, that's not good.
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:45.560]  He's a huge red flag guy. That's a huge red flag for him right there.
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:48.560]  That is a huge red flag. So what do you think comes next?
[2:51:48.560 --> 2:51:52.560]  Well, I think what's happening is that Pence is part of the control team,
[2:51:52.560 --> 2:51:54.560]  control Trump and set him up.
[2:51:54.560 --> 2:51:56.560]  That's what I really believe is going to happen to him.
[2:51:56.560 --> 2:51:59.560]  He's a globalist. I don't care how many times he kneels on the floor.
[2:51:59.560 --> 2:52:01.560]  So who would Trump replace Pence with?
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:06.560]  Any question? Who should he replace him with?
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:12.560]  Maybe Congressman Scalise. Jim Jordan, Rand Paul.
[2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:16.560]  What was the gentleman's name from Kansas?
[2:52:16.560 --> 2:52:19.560]  Hurley. No, the other one.
[2:52:19.560 --> 2:52:22.560]  No, I know he's the one that was Attorney General. He's really good.
[2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:23.560]  Yeah.
[2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:24.560]  Hurley, Hurley?
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:26.560]  Kasich. Kasich?
[2:52:26.560 --> 2:52:32.560]  No, I wouldn't go for Kasich. Kasich gives me a bad feeling,
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:36.560]  but Jim Jordan would be good in my mind.
[2:52:36.560 --> 2:52:37.560]  Jim Jordan tells a good guy.
[2:52:37.560 --> 2:52:39.560]  Well, Rand Paul.
[2:52:39.560 --> 2:52:41.560]  And Rand Paul is good too.
[2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:45.560]  Hey, we got to give Trump credit. He's pulling trips out of Afghanistan.
[2:52:45.560 --> 2:52:48.560]  Well, sure, but we're not taking care of this country.
[2:52:48.560 --> 2:52:49.560]  That's the problem.
[2:52:49.560 --> 2:52:51.560]  Because he's so focused on foreign affairs, he's been distracted,
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:53.560]  they're running the clock out on him.
[2:52:53.560 --> 2:52:58.560]  Meanwhile, we have this massive invasion of illegals that he has not yet stopped.
[2:52:58.560 --> 2:53:02.560]  Even right now, about the coronavirus, he's been asked by one conservative
[2:53:02.560 --> 2:53:04.560]  journalist, well, what about the southern border?
[2:53:04.560 --> 2:53:05.560]  We're going to look at that.
[2:53:05.560 --> 2:53:08.560]  He should have troops on the border right now and say,
[2:53:08.560 --> 2:53:11.560]  I'm locking the border down with the U.S. military, period,
[2:53:11.560 --> 2:53:14.560]  because illegal Chinese come through the border all the time.
[2:53:14.560 --> 2:53:18.560]  So we need to start exercising our territorial jurisdiction.
[2:53:18.560 --> 2:53:20.560]  And you should exercise his powers as president.
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:23.560]  Well, all these libertarians go, oh, we don't need a government.
[2:53:23.560 --> 2:53:27.560]  What do you do when the Nazis are the communists or the chai comms come against you?
[2:53:27.560 --> 2:53:28.560]  Like, I get it.
[2:53:28.560 --> 2:53:29.560]  We don't want a government.
[2:53:29.560 --> 2:53:31.560]  We want to get rid of it all.
[2:53:31.560 --> 2:53:34.560]  The point is, what do you do when there's another militarized government coming at you?
[2:53:34.560 --> 2:53:36.560]  You want to constitute a government that's limited,
[2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:37.560]  that protects your rights, that you control.
[2:53:37.560 --> 2:53:39.560]  It's not going to be perfect to defend against them.
[2:53:39.560 --> 2:53:41.560]  How do you square that up?
[2:53:41.560 --> 2:53:43.560]  Because I get the anarchic capitalist arguments.
[2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:44.560]  It just doesn't exist.
[2:53:44.560 --> 2:53:45.560]  It creates warlords instantly.
[2:53:45.560 --> 2:53:47.560]  You remove a government power.
[2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:48.560]  Other ones spring up.
[2:53:48.560 --> 2:53:50.560]  Yeah, that's why I'm not a hardcore...
[2:53:50.560 --> 2:53:52.560]  You want major awards for constitutional articles?
[2:53:52.560 --> 2:53:57.560]  That's why I'm what you call a menarchism, not a no-state libertarian,
[2:53:57.560 --> 2:53:58.560]  because it doesn't work.
[2:53:58.560 --> 2:54:00.560]  Someone's going to make rules and someone's going to enforce them.
[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:01.560]  Exactly.
[2:54:01.560 --> 2:54:02.560]  Somebody always making rules.
[2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:03.560]  Better be me.
[2:54:03.560 --> 2:54:04.560]  Right.
[2:54:04.560 --> 2:54:05.560]  Not some warlord on some hill.
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:06.560]  Exactly.
[2:54:06.560 --> 2:54:07.560]  Colonel?
[2:54:07.560 --> 2:54:11.560]  But we have a constitution that says exactly what the state should do
[2:54:11.560 --> 2:54:15.560]  and what the federal government can't do.
[2:54:15.560 --> 2:54:18.560]  But the federal government has that responsibility.
[2:54:18.560 --> 2:54:22.560]  You know, I lived through the rift, the reduction in force after Vietnam,
[2:54:22.560 --> 2:54:27.560]  and those soldiers were just kicked out.
[2:54:27.560 --> 2:54:31.560]  There's places where we could use the soldiers that are coming back out of Afghanistan.
[2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:34.560]  One of them is right on the southern border here in Texas.
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:37.560]  That we could mobilize and pay for it right now.
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:38.560]  Right now.
[2:54:38.560 --> 2:54:39.560]  That money's already there.
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:42.560]  We could call them up as the militia under the federal statutes
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:43.560]  and put them on the border.
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:44.560]  Well, that's the other thing.
[2:54:44.560 --> 2:54:49.560]  And if Trump wants to truly win, he should stand in as the potas in this crisis.
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:51.560]  As Patty kind of said, he must now do it.
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:53.560]  He's already gotten almost there.
[2:54:53.560 --> 2:54:54.560]  He's just got to do it.
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:54:55.560]  In a constitutional manner.
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:55:00.560]  And the way to do that is to call up the militia, as the colonels point now,
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:03.560]  put us all of us veterans back on the border and lock it down
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:06.560]  and stop all international flights to start right there.
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:08.560]  And that would kill the cartels instantly.
[2:55:08.560 --> 2:55:09.560]  Oh, yeah.
[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:10.560]  Absolutely.
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:11.560]  Total exercise of power.
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:12.560]  It would.
[2:55:12.560 --> 2:55:16.560]  And would also stop the further flying in of people that are infected with this virus
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:17.560]  and make him a hero.
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:18.560]  Well, let's be honest.
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:20.560]  The virus is a cover to secure the republic.
[2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:22.560]  But it is a problem.
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:24.560]  I'm just saying we should be honest about that.
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:25.560]  Well, sure.
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:28.560]  That's why I don't want to see, you know, I think martial law is unconstitutional anyway,
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:32.560]  but I don't want to see any draconian things done to the American people.
[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:34.560]  But locking the border down is not martial law.
[2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:35.560]  Exactly.
[2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:36.560]  Exactly.
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:37.560]  You're right.
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:41.560]  There's no martial law here in our neighborhoods, but not on the border.
[2:55:41.560 --> 2:55:44.560]  But how do you keep from locking down that?
[2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:47.560]  One of those issues is the militia.
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:52.560]  Take the arms away from the militia so that they can't go defend that.
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:56.560]  We don't need a presidential order as a militia to go down there and do it.
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:55:57.560]  Individuals will step up.
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:00.560]  That's why the Japanese didn't invade this country.
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:03.560]  Generally all about a gun behind everybody's grasp.
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:04.560]  Absolutely.
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:08.560]  But that's the thing is the average domesticated person hears that and goes,
[2:56:08.560 --> 2:56:10.560]  men just go and defend.
[2:56:10.560 --> 2:56:12.560]  That's what the world ran like.
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:13.560]  Right.
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:14.560]  You know.
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:19.560]  So, yeah, I mean, this is the problem is that the president is being told by the advisors,
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:23.560]  don't do the manly Teddy Roosevelt thing to do.
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:25.560]  Don't do what you actually have a responsibility for.
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:26.560]  With the rough riders.
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:27.560]  Yeah.
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:28.560]  Instead, no, no, don't do that.
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:29.560]  General Jack Pershing.
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:30.560]  That by scare people.
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:31.560]  Don't do that.
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:32.560]  That could cause a panic.
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:33.560]  I'm so tired of the word panic.
[2:56:33.560 --> 2:56:34.560]  People panic.
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:35.560]  You should be panicked in a way.
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:39.560]  Well, those drug cartels, the men at the Marines went to be over.
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:41.560]  Oh, yeah, they'd be done.
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:43.560]  So we've been saying this for years.
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:48.560]  The colonel and I spent, you know, months actually on the border in Mexico and Texas
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:49.560]  and all over the place.
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:55.560]  And we just pulled our hair out saying, President Trump can and should lock the border down
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:56:56.560]  with troops.
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:56:57.560]  You should have done that before.
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:56:58.560]  You should do it now.
[2:56:58.560 --> 2:56:59.560]  And so Pepe can is correct.
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:04.560]  He should act decisively right now and he'll be clear of nothing's happened on the border.
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:06.560]  It's the president's right to militarize it.
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:08.560]  But now it's out of control.
[2:57:08.560 --> 2:57:12.560]  You should, instead of being told the news, get ready to be locked down in your houses
[2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:16.560]  in Austin, Texas or Chicago, Illinois, but the border is still going to be open.
[2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:17.560]  Right.
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:22.560]  So it's always about controlling you, not controlling the border.
[2:57:22.560 --> 2:57:23.560]  Insane.
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:24.560]  All right, gentlemen.
[2:57:24.560 --> 2:57:25.560]  Thank you, John Siemens.
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:26.560]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:27.560]  Appreciate you.

[2:57:28.560 --> 2:57:29.560]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:30.560]  You bet.
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:33.840]  I'm going to finish up on the other side of this break and I'm going to bring in our
[2:57:33.840 --> 2:57:39.560]  next guest, Mike Adams, who you all want to listen to straight ahead, infowars.com,
[2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:43.720]  tomorrow's news today.
[2:57:43.720 --> 2:57:45.400]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:47.560]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[2:57:47.560 --> 2:57:51.160]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[2:57:51.160 --> 2:57:56.520]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[2:57:56.520 --> 2:57:59.880]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad, I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:01.480]  bottom line.
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:04.080]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face.
[2:58:04.080 --> 2:58:05.480]  The globalists not contract.
[2:58:05.480 --> 2:58:06.760]  I don't want them to win.
[2:58:06.760 --> 2:58:09.680]  So listen, you've got this guarantee for me.

[2:58:14.360 --> 2:58:15.960]  give the globalists around for their money.

[2:59:48.560 --> 2:59:55.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:37.920]  Man, I'm going to talk to these guests last hour and a half and I had a feeling, I said
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:44.520]  let me go to Infowars.com, we see what's on there, and man, it blew me away, absolutely
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:45.520]  blew me away.
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:51.520]  But it's just Infowars, who looks at that, who cares about that, you know what I mean?
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:55.880]  I mean, if Infowars isn't concerned about Infowars, why should it even exist?
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:58.400]  Why should it even be on this planet?
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:02.000]  So I'll read it off my phone, that's the only way we can get it to you.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:09.560]  Doc, overhead shot please, good old overhead shot please, and I will show TV viewers these
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:23.200]  articles, so Switzerland quarantines all active duty soldiers, wow, that's a big story, isn't
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:24.200]  it?
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:27.280]  Wow, look at this one, man, that's pretty newsworthy.
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:33.280]  You will pay the price Chuck Schumer threatens Supreme Court justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh,
[3:01:33.280 --> 3:01:38.040]  wow, that's a big story right there, pretty important.
[3:01:38.040 --> 3:01:44.080]  Very illegal alien accused of rape, protecting the sanctuary, policies.
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:50.280]  Bernie cozy's up to Obama, a new ad following Super Tuesday loss.
[3:01:50.280 --> 3:02:01.360]  Seek Uggur melts down after Bernie loses Super Tuesday.
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:05.360]  Pretty big.
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:19.680]  Pretty big stuff man, pretty important.
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:27.720]  Mike Adams is going to take over here in just a few minutes, he's got a lot of news to cover
[3:02:27.720 --> 3:02:33.880]  on the economy and the coronavirus and the rest of what's happening, you know, I tried
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:40.080]  to have a good time earlier here on air.
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:47.640]  I tried to cover these topics as best I could, but the truth is humanity is ready to die
[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:51.280]  and humanity is going to die billions.
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:58.600]  You know, I look into the future, I see almost everybody dead soon because there's not a
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:04.720]  consciousness and when there's not a consciousness, there's nothing but drift and I don't say
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:06.360]  this from some elitist perspective.
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:12.240]  I last night went to the grocery store because my children wanted some ice cream.
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:15.880]  Men I walked, the people were mean, they were cut each other off, they were pissed and even
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:20.680]  be alive and they were just, they were just, they were just in hell.
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:23.920]  I looked at that and I said, this isn't what people used to look like.
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:37.200]  This isn't how people used to act, but you see, they've been put, they've been put into
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:49.920]  a trance, they've been put into a deep trance.
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:57.280]  And so as mad as you get at them, you got to remember they're in trance.
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:00.920]  So imagine screaming and yelling at somebody who's asleep in a bed like, why don't you
[3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:01.920]  see this?
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:03.800]  Why don't you know about this?
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:07.520]  Because they're asleep and they're not going to see anything.
[3:04:07.520 --> 3:04:11.840]  And so it just becomes down to a point of, well, do we even try to keep waking people
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:25.400]  up or do we, those of us that are awake and involved and engaged, that we take action?
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:30.600]  Because there's a true spiritual death taking place.
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:31.600]  Globalists did it with the TV.
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:38.320]  They admitted they've got the average person has the attention span of a goldfish and the
[3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:43.600]  globalists celebrate that every minute and every second because they don't have the attention
[3:04:43.600 --> 3:04:44.920]  span of a goldfish.
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:53.120]  They have a huge program to take us down their following.
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:57.200]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're
[3:04:57.200 --> 3:05:01.400]  seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:02.400]  That's good.
[3:05:02.400 --> 3:05:04.240]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:09.600]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth paycheck-to-paycheck and doesn't even know
[3:05:09.600 --> 3:05:10.600]  how to change their tire.
[3:05:10.600 --> 3:05:16.080]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared and that means even with just the
[3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:20.960]  basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there that you only go
[3:05:20.960 --> 3:05:22.600]  to in emergencies.
[3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:27.720]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so.
[3:05:27.720 --> 3:05:32.480]  And things like DNA Force Plus that's now back in stock is so good for your cells, your
[3:05:32.480 --> 3:05:36.040]  mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.

[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:45.480]  fusion and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[3:06:07.840 --> 3:06:14.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, burning down from Austin, Texas, it's Info War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:14.640 --> 3:06:17.560]  Burning down like everybody else, going to hell.
[3:06:17.560 --> 3:06:24.560]  Well, the video that nobody gives a damn about is on infowars.com.
[3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:30.760]  You will pay the price while he said Trump would pay, he said Trump would pay six ways
[3:06:30.760 --> 3:06:33.280]  this Sunday for challenging them.
[3:06:33.280 --> 3:06:38.640]  And now he's issued a new incredible video on infowars.com right now.
[3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:39.640]  You will pay the price.
[3:06:39.640 --> 3:06:44.560]  Chuck Schumer threatened Supreme Court Justice Gorsh's in Cabinol, Senate Majority Leader
[3:06:44.560 --> 3:06:47.940]  Chuck Schumer threatened the conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsh's and Brett
[3:06:47.940 --> 3:06:49.560]  Cabinol on Wednesday over abortion.
[3:06:49.560 --> 3:06:55.760]  Speaking at a Portland Planned Parenthood rally, a eugenics rally outside of the court
[3:06:55.760 --> 3:07:01.520]  in D.C., Schumer launched a veiled threat at the two justices over how they may vote
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:04.320]  in an upcoming abortion related case.
[3:07:04.320 --> 3:07:11.480]  I want to tell you, Justice Cabinol, Justice Gorsh, you have unleashed a whirlwind.
[3:07:11.480 --> 3:07:15.000]  You will pay the price because Schumer wants that baby blood.
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:18.720]  Schumer yells with cheering on, I guess we got that video for you coming up.
[3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:22.600]  In fact, here it is.
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:25.120]  And they're taking away fundamental rights.
[3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:32.280]  I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Cabinol, you have released the whirlwind
[3:07:32.280 --> 3:07:35.280]  and you will pay the price.
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:46.080]  He finally gets his blood up for baby blood, baby blood, baby blood, baby blood, wow.
[3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:48.400]  That's just some of the news at infowars.com.
[3:07:48.400 --> 3:07:53.720]  Lockheed Martin stops F-35 manufacturing in Japan, Italy due to coronavirus.
[3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:54.720]  What's a worthless aircraft?
[3:07:54.720 --> 3:07:55.720]  Go ahead.
[3:07:55.720 --> 3:07:59.480]  Another illegal alien accused of rape protected by sanctuary policies in New York.
[3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:05.320]  New theory, family sheds light on dark matter, infowars.com, it's all there.
[3:08:05.320 --> 3:08:10.400]  Trump unloads on spoiler, Elizabeth Warren, French fire minister slams Turkey over migration
[3:08:10.400 --> 3:08:11.520]  invasion.
[3:08:11.520 --> 3:08:15.080]  It's all happening now.
[3:08:15.080 --> 3:08:17.520]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is about to take over.
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:18.720]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[3:08:18.720 --> 3:08:21.480]  I'm just going to tell you this.
[3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:22.720]  More important than storeable food.
[3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:25.720]  We've got the only storeable food company that has storeable food that will actually ship
[3:08:25.720 --> 3:08:28.960]  it to you in high quality than for store.com, ready to go.
[3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:29.960]  The food's there.
[3:08:29.960 --> 3:08:32.240]  It's got a package to ship it out to you.
[3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:35.480]  We have the supplements that boost the immunity.
[3:08:35.480 --> 3:08:37.960]  We have the DNA force plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10.
[3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:41.200]  We have the X2 with the X3 high quality iodine.
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:43.560]  We have vitamin mineral fusion back in stock.
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:48.040]  And we have turbo force that's the amazing natural clean 10 hour energy.
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:53.640]  That's back in stock all 40% off and your purchase of those products makes the broadcast
[3:08:53.640 --> 3:08:54.640]  possible.
[3:08:54.640 --> 3:08:58.240]  You can also always call toll free and ask any questions or order via the phone at triple
[3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:07.040]  eight 2533139, triple eight 2533139, triple eight 2533139.
[3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:11.880]  But I was selling supplements to boost your immunity before the crisis.
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:13.560]  I was selling storeable food before the crisis.
[3:09:13.560 --> 3:09:23.600]  I was selling filtered water because of the crap in the system.
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:26.960]  You buy the products because they're high quality and it funds the operation and it
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:30.600]  keeps us on air despite Soros and Bloomberg and all their attacks.
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:31.600]  It's a beautiful thing.
[3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:32.600]  I get these calls.
[3:09:32.600 --> 3:09:37.560]  I took a bunch of calls yesterday like I thought you were full of hype and I got your X2 and
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:40.960]  it changed my life or I got DNA force changed my life.
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:43.600]  What do you think we're selling?
[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:47.600]  It's the best stuff out there without the fillers.
[3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:50.680]  It's game changing that God gave us through the biosphere.
[3:09:50.680 --> 3:09:52.680]  So take advantage of them for store.com.
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:53.680]  All right.
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:58.960]  Mike Adams is taking over right now for the balance of the hour than Owen Shroyer and
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:09:59.960]  the war room.
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:00.960]  Straight ahead.
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:04.440]  Whatever you do, don't tell people about the local AM and FM stations.
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:08.160]  Don't spread the links because we want to lose.
[3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:09.160]  If you do, we win.
[3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:13.960]  Not being sarcastic, spread the links to live shows and all that's happening because this
[3:10:13.960 --> 3:10:17.880]  is a human fight against the globalist and we are together the resistance.
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:20.560]  Mike Adams takes over.
[3:10:20.560 --> 3:10:27.960]  Well, welcome to the whole new world of the pandemic to all watching LA County has just
[3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:33.360]  declared an emergency earlier this morning and their outbreaks not only in Northern California,
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:37.920]  but now Oregon's head of their state health department last night said he believes there
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:44.080]  may be up to 500 infections across Oregon right now, but they still can't get the tests
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:48.200]  done because the testing kits aren't available at the local level.
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:52.000]  Now I do understand they're being produced originally.
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:56.040]  I know there's a big push for that in the FDA and the CDC and at the White House and
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:11:01.960]  those kits should be readily available soon, but they're not yet in the hands of the doctors,
[3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:06.480]  the frontline doctors in the hospitals in New York and Seattle and Los Angeles.
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:12.560]  But you are going to experience the most interesting year of your life as this unfolds.
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:14.760]  And today here on the show, I've got a lot for you.
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:20.400]  I'm going to be covering lists of sanitizers that you can use that may be very useful for
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:22.560]  killing viruses on surfaces.
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:26.880]  So if you want to know what to stock up on or even how to make your own hand sanitizer,
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:28.400]  I'll be covering that for you here.
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:34.440]  There's new science on nutraceuticals that hold very good promise for possibly halting
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:37.360]  coronavirus replication in your body.
[3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:42.120]  That's been covered in a journal, What Progress and Cardiovascular Disease and we'll go through
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:46.960]  the list there, a lot of different minerals and herbs and nutraceuticals that are widely
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:47.960]  available.
[3:11:47.960 --> 3:11:49.960]  Some of them may be available at the Infowars Store.
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:54.160]  I haven't checked yet, but we're going to cover that list and give you a link to that
[3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:55.640]  as well.
[3:11:55.640 --> 3:12:01.400]  We've got the answers to how to solve this, how Trump could take a leadership position
[3:12:01.400 --> 3:12:06.200]  here and solve this and be the hero that conquered the pandemic.
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:10.760]  I do have suggestions for President Trump on how he can accomplish that, but it does
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:15.960]  require him looking beyond just vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry.
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:19.840]  Right now, a lot of people are just waiting for big pharma to rescue them when there's
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:26.440]  a whole world of natural antivirals and other even strategies that we can use as a society
[3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:27.440]  to isolate this.
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:31.840]  In fact, Stuart Rhodes mentioned that in the last hour that domestic flights right now
[3:12:31.840 --> 3:12:35.920]  should probably be canceled and he's correct about that.
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:40.040]  In fact, I believe that airplanes are currently spreading this all across the country right
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:44.600]  now, and it's only because of the lack of diagnostic test kits that we don't yet know
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:47.600]  the full extent of that spread that's taking place.
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:52.760]  But with this doubling about every week, it's an exponential explosion.
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:55.200]  We're seeing clusters of outbreaks now.
[3:12:55.200 --> 3:12:59.560]  In another two to three weeks, it's going to be full blown outbreaks, hundreds if not
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:04.040]  thousands of cases will be confirmed across the United States if the testing kits are
[3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:05.360]  made available.
[3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:09.880]  And from there, if you follow the math, eventually it'll be 100,000 people infected,
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:10.880]  and maybe millions.
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:15.320]  And now, today, even Fox News is reporting that the calculated mortality rate from this
[3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:18.600]  is 3%, or actually above 3%.
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:24.480]  Keep in mind that the regular flu mortality rate is below 0.1%.
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:27.960]  It's actually typically estimated at 0.07%.
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:36.080]  So in other words, the coronavirus is at least 30 times more deadly than the regular flu.
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:40.760]  So when people tell you that this is just another flu, they haven't really done the
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:41.760]  math.
[3:13:41.760 --> 3:13:45.760]  They don't understand the numbers, I suppose, or maybe they just haven't read up on it.
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:51.160]  It's not the flu, and you have celebrity doctors out there like Dr. Drew still telling
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:54.600]  people that it's just the flu and everybody should stop being concerned.
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:13:58.360]  Well, you know, I'm sorry, but that's just misinformed.
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:00.400]  This is spreading exponentially.
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:03.960]  It has a, at least 30 times higher mortality rate.
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:08.800]  And even people who survive the infections tend to have permanent lung damage, permanent
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:14.160]  heart damage, and in some cases, the disease comes roaring back in their own bodies.
[3:14:14.160 --> 3:14:20.160]  So you have secondary infections, what I call zombie virus type of processes that are taking
[3:14:20.160 --> 3:14:21.840]  place in the body.
[3:14:21.840 --> 3:14:28.200]  And because this is a novel virus that the human species has never experienced before,
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:31.920]  we have virtually no tools from mainstream medicine to fight it.
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:37.080]  And this is, if I could be critical, of President Trump's handling of this, or more appropriately,
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:38.080]  Mike Pence's handling.
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:42.240]  And I don't have a lot of faith in Mike Pence to handle this at all.
[3:14:42.240 --> 3:14:46.000]  But the criticism of what Trump is doing is that he hasn't yet put the right people in
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:50.400]  place around him to advise him on the right things to do.
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:54.600]  He's just surrounded by NIH people like Dr. Fauci, he's surrounded by big pharma people
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:59.280]  and vaccine industry people, and then people like Mike Pence, who is, you know, he's an
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:01.560]  ethical, moral American.
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:05.280]  He's a great guy, but he's not a doctor, he's not a virologist, not an epidemiologist.
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:10.240]  So you got to have good people around you if you're going to make good decisions about
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:11.600]  how to stop this.
[3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:14.600]  So here on the show today, I'm going to be focused on that.
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:16.680]  I know how to stop this.
[3:15:16.680 --> 3:15:17.680]  I'm not the only one.
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:19.120]  I mean, it's widely known how to stop this.
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:23.920]  We're going to cover that information and then give you specific advice on how to make
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:31.240]  your own hand sanitizer, how to make your own surface sanitizers, possible herbs, antivirals
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:37.600]  and minerals that might help you resist this infection if you encounter it, and much more.
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:41.320]  All that straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show, this is Mike Adams, we'll be back after
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:42.320]  this break.
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:43.320]  Stay with us.
[3:15:43.320 --> 3:15:53.080]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:57.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:15:58.560]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:58.560 --> 3:16:01.520]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:04.800]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:07.040]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:07.040 --> 3:16:08.360]  I can help you too.
[3:16:08.360 --> 3:16:11.360]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:11.360 --> 3:16:13.600]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:17:53.520 --> 3:18:00.880]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars, the family of listeners and viewers that without
[3:18:00.880 --> 3:18:04.440]  you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:08.600]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing
[3:18:08.600 --> 3:18:11.720]  the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[3:18:11.720 --> 3:18:17.600]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:18.600]  really amazing.
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:22.520]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:24.360]  filtration, the water filtration.
[3:18:24.360 --> 3:18:29.360]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:34.040]  an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[3:18:34.040 --> 3:18:37.920]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:45.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:48.560]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:19:14.360]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[3:19:14.360 --> 3:19:43.720]  Have a great day.
[3:19:44.360 --> 3:20:06.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:16.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:22.800]  So we now know in summary, we now know that the coronavirus mortality rate is at least
[3:20:22.800 --> 3:20:25.640]  30 times higher than Influenza.
[3:20:25.640 --> 3:20:33.000]  So people talking about this is just another flu or saying that Influenza kills more people.
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:36.640]  That's not true on a percentage basis and the only reason more people haven't died yet
[3:20:36.640 --> 3:20:43.560]  from coronavirus is because it has only just begun to spread in North America.
[3:20:43.560 --> 3:20:48.480]  In fact right now far fewer than 1% of the US population or even fewer than 1% of the
[3:20:48.480 --> 3:20:53.440]  world population has been infected with this coronavirus so far.
[3:20:53.440 --> 3:20:55.880]  Well that is if you believe the official numbers.
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:20:59.280]  But even if the numbers, the real numbers were double or triple or quadruple, still wouldn't
[3:20:59.280 --> 3:21:00.920]  be very much of the world population.
[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:04.840]  In other words, this has only just begun, it's like the tip of the iceberg.
[3:21:04.840 --> 3:21:09.720]  So everything that you're seeing right now in America with the fatalities now, 10 people
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:13.800]  dead from coronavirus in America announced this morning.
[3:21:13.800 --> 3:21:18.160]  The outbreaks in Seattle, which we called a month ago here on the show by the way, our
[3:21:18.160 --> 3:21:22.480]  sources told us that the CDC and Homeland Security were already aware of outbreaks happening
[3:21:22.480 --> 3:21:26.080]  in Seattle even though they withheld that information from the public.
[3:21:26.080 --> 3:21:31.560]  You heard it here first on Infowars.com because our sources knew exactly what was going on.
[3:21:31.560 --> 3:21:36.520]  And what our sources are telling us right now is that FEMA is preparing and the DOD
[3:21:36.520 --> 3:21:41.760]  is preparing for a scenario that would involve millions of deaths in the United States and
[3:21:41.760 --> 3:21:43.800]  over 100 million people infected.
[3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:47.400]  Now you might say arguably maybe that's the worst case scenario.
[3:21:47.400 --> 3:21:51.440]  Okay, so let's take a more conservative scenario.
[3:21:51.440 --> 3:21:55.880]  What if only a quarter of the population gets infected?
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:22:01.480]  In that case, you still have over 1.5 million deaths at a 2% death rate or over roughly
[3:22:01.480 --> 3:22:03.520]  about 2 million deaths at a 3% death rate.
[3:22:03.520 --> 3:22:08.600]  So even if only one out of four people get infected, you're looking at millions of deaths.
[3:22:08.600 --> 3:22:13.720]  Now there are only three ways that this stops.
[3:22:13.720 --> 3:22:18.480]  So I've heard other people predicting this will be over in six weeks or this will burn
[3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:21.200]  out in the summer or it's already over.
[3:22:21.200 --> 3:22:25.520]  Some people say it's already burned through the population and we just didn't notice it.
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:27.520]  And then other people are saying there is no virus.
[3:22:27.520 --> 3:22:30.840]  So I guess you have all kinds of interesting theories.
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:32.320]  I think that's all nonsense.
[3:22:32.320 --> 3:22:37.120]  I think this is very real and it can only be stopped in three ways.
[3:22:37.120 --> 3:22:38.680]  And those ways are as follows.
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:40.840]  Number one, you can isolate people.
[3:22:40.840 --> 3:22:47.440]  So quarantines, canceling public meetings, stopping all domestic air travel, quarantines
[3:22:47.440 --> 3:22:54.120]  of cities, roadblocks, all these things actually do work to isolate infections.
[3:22:54.120 --> 3:22:57.600]  That's why Italy has been running roadblocks and that's why China welded people shut in
[3:22:57.600 --> 3:22:58.600]  their apartments.
[3:22:58.600 --> 3:23:00.480]  And I'm not saying that we should do that here.
[3:23:00.480 --> 3:23:04.000]  Just from an epidemiological point of view, I'm pointing out the three ways that you stop
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  this.
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:10.040]  It's up to us as a society to decide which of these ways we wish to invoke.
[3:23:10.040 --> 3:23:11.280]  Some of them are quite draconian.
[3:23:11.280 --> 3:23:13.360]  Some of them violate human rights as we've seen in China.
[3:23:13.360 --> 3:23:18.200]  I mean, in China, one of the methods they use was just to execute people who were infected.
[3:23:18.200 --> 3:23:20.040]  Now does that work to stop the spread?
[3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:21.960]  Yeah, sure it does.
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:24.200]  But does it violate human rights?
[3:23:24.200 --> 3:23:25.200]  Of course.
[3:23:25.200 --> 3:23:29.240]  I mean, they put live people in the body bags and toss them into the cremation ovens according
[3:23:29.240 --> 3:23:30.880]  to some reports.
[3:23:30.880 --> 3:23:36.400]  That's obviously heinous and incredibly evil, but it's very indicative of how communism
[3:23:36.400 --> 3:23:37.400]  functions.
[3:23:37.400 --> 3:23:39.560]  In any case, method one is isolation.
[3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:43.040]  However, you want to play that out, isolation does work.
[3:23:43.040 --> 3:23:49.640]  If you stop people from getting together and sharing the virus through aerosolized particles
[3:23:49.640 --> 3:23:56.160]  or touching each other or what have you, let's not have Mike Bloomberg setting up the food
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:23:57.880]  buffet in the coronavirus pandemic.
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:24:05.400]  I'll tell you what, Mr. Finger, Lick and Good, Food Buffet Pig, I got to say I have wild
[3:24:05.400 --> 3:24:12.000]  hogs in Texas and I watch them sometimes at night when I'm walking my dogs and the hogs
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:15.360]  are more polite eaters than Mike Bloomberg was in that video.
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:20.560]  I'm telling you, the hogs are nice compared to little Mike Bloomberg there.
[3:24:20.560 --> 3:24:25.320]  In any case, the second way to stop this, so first way was isolation.
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:27.280]  Second way is antivirals.
[3:24:27.280 --> 3:24:31.680]  So if you can stop the virus from replicating in the human body and if you can get those
[3:24:31.680 --> 3:24:37.640]  antivirals out on a widespread basis, and this is something that Dr. Jack told us during
[3:24:37.640 --> 3:24:41.960]  an interview on the show last week, James Lyons-Wiler is his name, he said if you can
[3:24:41.960 --> 3:24:45.920]  get antivirals out to the population, then you will really suppress the replication and
[3:24:45.920 --> 3:24:47.280]  spread of the virus.
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:52.120]  Those antivirals can be nutraceuticals, which I'll cover in the next segment, a complete
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:24:53.120]  list.
[3:24:53.120 --> 3:24:56.480]  Well, it's a growing list, but it's a good list already of things that may be strong
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:25:02.120]  candidates for stopping viral replication in your body, but also antiviral pharmaceuticals
[3:25:02.120 --> 3:25:06.120]  are candidates for this as well, and there are already antiretroviral drugs that are
[3:25:06.120 --> 3:25:11.480]  being used for things like HIV infections and some for Ebola in the past as well.
[3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:15.320]  So there may be candidates from the world of big pharma that could be used, but it might
[3:25:15.320 --> 3:25:19.160]  be a very long time before those are known, whereas the nutraceuticals, the herbs and
[3:25:19.160 --> 3:25:23.640]  the minerals are very well known right now to deal with other types of viruses that are
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:25.720]  in the same family actually.
[3:25:25.720 --> 3:25:27.960]  So that's something that should be considered.
[3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:32.760]  In my opinion, President Trump should have a national press conference and he should
[3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:40.080]  tell everybody, take vitamin D, eat turmeric, eat licorice root, just get healthier, eat
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:44.200]  these herbs and minerals and superfoods, and he can give a list.
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:45.760]  And that would really help big time.
[3:25:45.760 --> 3:25:50.920]  That would stop a lot of people from spreading infection right now.
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:52.040]  So that's the second way.
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:57.360]  The third way that this stops is if it burns through the population, sweeps through all
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:26:02.240]  the people, everybody gets infected, and then you end up with two groups on the other side.
[3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:05.520]  People who are one immune or two dead.
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:07.320]  So that's it.
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:08.520]  You let it sweep through the population.
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:09.520]  I'm not saying that you should do this.
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:14.400]  I'm just saying theoretically, this is one way to end it.
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:18.240]  And China may be doing this is just let it burn through the population.
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:23.080]  You're going to lose 10% of the population, perhaps the other 90%.
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:24.520]  Most of those will have good immunity.
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:26.840]  Some will have permanent lung damage.
[3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:30.000]  But if you're China and you want to run your factories and keep your economy going, they
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:34.640]  can probably just justify that to say, oh, we're going to lose one out of 10 people.
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:35.640]  That's it.
[3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:41.720]  Well, if you do that in America, then that's over 30 million deaths, if 10% die.
[3:26:41.720 --> 3:26:46.960]  So hopefully that's not one of the approaches that will be attempted here in this country.
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:49.920]  But again, there are only three ways this ends.
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:51.200]  It ends by isolation.
[3:26:51.200 --> 3:26:56.200]  It ends by antivirals, or it ends by burning through the population, killing people, or
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:26:58.080]  building immunity in the survivors.
[3:26:58.080 --> 3:26:59.680]  And that's it.
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:02.160]  There are no other scenarios where this ends.
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:04.480]  Notably, it doesn't end by magic.
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:07.280]  It doesn't end because we want to protect the stock market.
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:11.560]  It doesn't end because we wish for it to end.
[3:27:11.560 --> 3:27:13.840]  It doesn't end just because summer arrives.
[3:27:13.840 --> 3:27:18.120]  I know there's this theory floating around that this will go away in the summer.
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:20.400]  There's no scientific basis for that whatsoever.
[3:27:20.400 --> 3:27:22.720]  That's true with influenza.
[3:27:22.720 --> 3:27:25.640]  But there's no evidence that that's true with coronavirus, which is a totally different
[3:27:25.640 --> 3:27:27.520]  family of viruses.
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:30.640]  And besides, it's spreading in indoor environments.
[3:27:30.640 --> 3:27:31.880]  It's spreading in nursing homes.
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:36.400]  It's spreading on cruise ships, it's spreading in airplanes, and airports, and police stations,
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:39.120]  and government offices, and Amazon offices.
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:42.800]  There's an Amazon employee test of positive, and Google offices, and so on.
[3:27:42.800 --> 3:27:45.520]  Those are not outdoor environments.
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:47.880]  Amazon employees are not working out in the fields.
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:51.760]  They're working in indoor, air-conditioned environments.
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:56.640]  And because of that, the weather outside is basically irrelevant to this.
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:00.600]  The only thing that might be a factor is that in the summer, more people get more vitamin
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:01.600]  D.
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:07.520]  And since vitamin D is very effective at protecting respiratory function, then it's possible that
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:13.960]  vitamin D acquisition during the summer might cause a suppression of the number of cases
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:14.960]  that are spreading.
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:16.840]  So I do see that as a possibility.
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:20.760]  But just the temperature is irrelevant, doesn't matter whether it's hot or cold outside.
[3:28:20.760 --> 3:28:24.240]  This isn't spreading outdoors, it's spreading indoors.
[3:28:24.240 --> 3:28:28.840]  So there is no scenario that I've seen where this ends in a month, or two months, or even
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:31.000]  six months, or even a year.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:33.640]  This will likely be with us for many years.
[3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:38.160]  It may interfere with the election in November because so many people will be under quarantine
[3:28:38.160 --> 3:28:39.760]  or self-isolation.
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:42.600]  We don't know yet, but that's a scenario we have to consider.
[3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:47.400]  So when we come back, we'll talk about nutraceuticals and practical solutions that can work for
[3:28:47.400 --> 3:28:48.400]  you.
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:49.560]  We'll be right back.
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:55.040]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:30:52.480 --> 3:30:58.400]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by
[3:30:58.400 --> 3:31:00.920]  all the work to help people be prepared.
[3:31:00.920 --> 3:31:04.760]  And instead of just giving in to sickness care, take care of their health, take care
[3:31:04.760 --> 3:31:07.880]  of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[3:31:07.880 --> 3:31:12.800]  And I say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are being offered
[3:31:12.800 --> 3:31:15.640]  here, I've tried them and I use them every day.
[3:31:15.640 --> 3:31:20.040]  And that power pack that they have, the AMPM power pack, well, I wouldn't be so energetic
[3:31:20.040 --> 3:31:24.880]  this morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[3:31:24.880 --> 3:31:28.480]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember
[3:31:28.480 --> 3:31:32.600]  that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think
[3:31:32.600 --> 3:31:37.560]  about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of
[3:31:37.560 --> 3:31:44.120]  yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for
[3:31:44.120 --> 3:31:47.080]  good purpose for our families and for our communities.
[3:31:47.080 --> 3:31:53.240]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[3:31:53.240 --> 3:31:59.560]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports to even the Olympics, men,
[3:31:59.560 --> 3:32:04.680]  biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[3:32:04.680 --> 3:32:11.280]  This is men invading women's faces and bullying them and taking their rights away, all in
[3:32:11.280 --> 3:32:13.640]  the name of the liberalism and openness.
[3:32:13.640 --> 3:32:19.920]  And every day, I have stacks of news articles just like today, UK team find under house arrest
[3:32:19.920 --> 3:32:24.120]  for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[3:32:24.120 --> 3:32:31.160]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay £1,000 fine because
[3:32:31.160 --> 3:32:36.200]  it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[3:32:36.200 --> 3:32:37.700]  That's the thought police.
[3:32:37.700 --> 3:32:42.880]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[3:32:42.880 --> 3:32:44.160]  This is tyranny.
[3:32:44.160 --> 3:32:49.160]  These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human
[3:32:49.160 --> 3:32:50.160]  takeover.
[3:32:50.160 --> 3:32:51.160]  Resist it.
[3:32:51.160 --> 3:32:53.160]  Speak out against it.
[3:32:53.160 --> 3:33:00.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:00.160 --> 3:33:09.800]  Big brother mainstream media government cover ups.
[3:33:09.800 --> 3:33:10.800]  You want answers?
[3:33:10.800 --> 3:33:21.920]  Well, so does he, it's Mike Adams or we're going to cover some of the solutions to sanitizing
[3:33:21.920 --> 3:33:25.600]  surfaces, how to make your own hand sanitizer, nutraceuticals that are now being studied
[3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:31.040]  as possible agents to block replication of coronavirus in your body and maybe help save
[3:33:31.040 --> 3:33:32.600]  lives all across the world.
[3:33:32.600 --> 3:33:37.920]  But before we get to that very quickly, let's just talk about exponential spreading of the
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:44.040]  disease because I find that people who haven't yet grasped where this is going, they're
[3:33:44.040 --> 3:33:46.480]  not really following the exponential math for this.
[3:33:46.480 --> 3:33:48.120]  So I ask you this question.
[3:33:48.120 --> 3:33:53.840]  Right now, by my estimation, there are about 10,000 people infected in America, 10,000.
[3:33:53.840 --> 3:33:58.440]  They haven't yet been confirmed infected because of the lack of testing kits, which I believe
[3:33:58.440 --> 3:34:03.320]  was deliberate by the CDC to try to hurt President Trump and ultimately blame him for where
[3:34:03.320 --> 3:34:04.320]  this is going.
[3:34:04.320 --> 3:34:09.960]  So I ask you this question, if there are 10,000 infections today, and the number of infections
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:14.400]  doubles every week, so it just doubles every seven days.
[3:34:14.400 --> 3:34:16.680]  In truth, it actually doubles about every 3.5 days.
[3:34:16.680 --> 3:34:20.440]  But let's just say it's seven days because we're going to be real conservative with this.
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:26.280]  Over how many weeks does it take for the number of infections in America to exceed one million,
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:27.280]  one million infections.
[3:34:27.280 --> 3:34:30.520]  So 10,000 today, one million infections.
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:32.960]  How many weeks away is that if it doubles every week?
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:34.520]  So let's do the math.
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:42.960]  10,000 becomes 20,000, 40,000, 80,000, 160,000, 320,000, 640,000, then one million, 24,000.
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:45.680]  That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven weeks.
[3:34:45.680 --> 3:34:51.960]  So in seven weeks, we get to a million infections if nothing is done to isolate people.
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:58.120]  So in less than two months, if nothing changes, if we don't shut down domestic air travel
[3:34:58.120 --> 3:35:02.640]  and if we don't tell people to stay home and if we don't shut down the schools, if
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:08.120]  society just functions as normal all across America, then in seven weeks, we'll have a
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:09.960]  million infections.
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:13.520]  Now suppose you think that my initial estimate is wrong that there aren't 10,000 infections
[3:35:13.520 --> 3:35:14.520]  right now.
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:16.360]  Suppose you think there are only 5,000.
[3:35:16.360 --> 3:35:18.040]  Okay, great.
[3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:21.400]  Then since it doubles every week, then it just means that in eight weeks, we'll have
[3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:22.400]  a million.
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:24.400]  See, it just adds one more week.
[3:35:24.400 --> 3:35:28.560]  Or suppose you think, no, there are only 2,500 infections in America right now.
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:32.400]  Okay, well that means in nine weeks, there'll be a million if nothing is done to stop this.
[3:35:32.400 --> 3:35:39.840]  So my point is that at some point very soon, President Trump and the CDC and who knows who
[3:35:39.840 --> 3:35:44.720]  else, Homeland Security, somebody's going to have to declare a big nationwide state
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:50.920]  of emergency and just start shutting down travel and start quarantining cities and blocking
[3:35:50.920 --> 3:35:52.720]  highways and things like that.
[3:35:52.720 --> 3:35:57.080]  Otherwise, this thing gets to a million in less than two months or around two months,
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:35:58.080]  you could say.
[3:35:58.080 --> 3:36:01.360]  So that's why I believe that those kinds of stoppages are coming.
[3:36:01.360 --> 3:36:05.560]  They have to shut down elements of society in order to stop this from spreading.
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:08.880]  So let's get right to hand sanitizers here.
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:10.720]  Let's make a list.
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:18.920]  Here are some things that I believe show very high capability of killing viruses on surfaces.
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:22.560]  Now we know that even Lysol, you can go to store and buy Lysol.
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:24.360]  Lysol kills all kinds of viruses.
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:25.680]  It's not high.
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:26.680]  It does.
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:27.760]  It works.
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:31.120]  Bleach kills all kinds of viruses, but you don't even need full strength bleach.
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:33.040]  Again, hypochlorite, you can combine.
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:41.240]  You could do 1% bleach with 20% isopropyl alcohol and then 79% water.
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:47.480]  That right there is your own hand sanitizer, and that kills most viruses.
[3:36:47.480 --> 3:36:49.280]  Does it kill coronavirus?
[3:36:49.280 --> 3:36:52.840]  Probably, although we haven't proven it yet, but it probably does.
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:54.560]  Here are some things to be stocking up on right now.
[3:36:54.560 --> 3:36:56.120]  I made a little list here.
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:01.600]  Typical alcohol, and we just call it IPA in the lab, povidone iodine, which is for
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:02.600]  topical use.
[3:37:02.600 --> 3:37:08.280]  It's like surgical prep iodine basically kills everything on your skin or on surfaces.
[3:37:08.280 --> 3:37:12.080]  Ammonium chloride is a known antiviral chemical.
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:17.520]  It's somewhat caustic or toxic, but it's used by the military to decontaminate soldiers
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:21.040]  if they've gone through biological weapons areas.
[3:37:21.040 --> 3:37:24.160]  Then sodium hypochlorite, which is bleach.
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:29.080]  Usually you would dilute this quite a lot so that it's a very small percentage of sodium
[3:37:29.080 --> 3:37:31.280]  hypochlorite in the solution.
[3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:34.800]  Chlorine dioxide, it's possible that that could work on surfaces.
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:39.200]  Again, the testing hasn't been done yet, but that kills through oxidation.
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:45.680]  Not that viruses are alive, but it probably denatures viral protein fragments as well
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:49.320]  as killing other bacteria that make care of the virus potentially.
[3:37:49.320 --> 3:37:51.960]  Hydrogen peroxide is another one that you can acquire right now.
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:56.880]  You can go to a grocery store or pharmacy and you can purchase 3% hydrogen peroxide.
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:01.400]  If there's some places online, you can purchase up to 35%, which is very strong.
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:04.200]  That'll burn your skin, by the way, so be cautious with this.
[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:10.000]  What I demonstrated on the show the other day in studio there was putting a 3% hydrogen
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:16.920]  peroxide solution in a essential oil nebulizer, adding a few drops of iodine, and then inhaling
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:20.320]  some of that vapor as it comes out of the diffuser.
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:25.280]  But I've been doing that in the days since, and it's been working very, very well.
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:28.960]  Now, when we get to herbs, there's a new study that has just come out.
[3:38:28.960 --> 3:38:30.560]  I covered it this morning.
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:35.680]  It's published in progress in cardiovascular disease, and it covers a number of nutraceuticals.
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:40.640]  It mentions spirulina as one that Alex was talking about yesterday, I think.
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:41.640]  Yeah.
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:42.640]  It was yesterday on the show.
[3:38:42.640 --> 3:38:44.400]  You had a dream about spirulina.
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:49.480]  It helps to boost the body's type 1 interferon response to viral infections.
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:53.560]  But that study also mentions these other things that I'll mention here.
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:38:59.680]  Inacetilcystine, or what's called NAC, that's a common dietary supplement that you can find
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:02.400]  everywhere, basically.
[3:39:02.400 --> 3:39:08.520]  Ferulic acid or sodium ferulite, this may activate the TLR7 pathway to stimulate what's
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:10.880]  called type 1 interferon production.
[3:39:10.880 --> 3:39:13.840]  Lipoic acid may hold promise here.
[3:39:13.840 --> 3:39:18.120]  You can get that in the form of ALA or alpha-lipoic acid, and by the way, just as a disclaimer,
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:23.320]  none of these are proven, these are candidates that deserve research, and this is a science
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:28.080]  paper that I'm quoting from that's already been published, sulforaphane, which is one
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:32.360]  of the best molecules from cruciferous vegetables.
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:37.040]  You can go out and buy broccoli sprouts, I'm sorry, broccoli seeds, and you can make your
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:41.600]  own broccoli sprouts, and those sprouts are very high in sulforaphane.
[3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:46.000]  So what I've done over the years is I'll get radish sprouts and broccoli sprouts and
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:50.880]  things, sprout a little bit in a little jar, just like a canning jar, and then you can
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:55.920]  take those sprouts and drop them in your smoothie, and you grind them up, and of course they
[3:39:55.920 --> 3:40:03.200]  taste pretty wicked, but they've got molecules in them that are amazing, and also have anti-cancer
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:06.600]  properties as well, not just anti-viral properties.
[3:40:06.600 --> 3:40:09.760]  Selenium is a mineral that is part of this process.
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:15.880]  It helps your body block the replication process of viruses, maybe not coronavirus,
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:21.640]  we don't know yet, but certainly many other viruses, a lot of research about selenium.
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:27.320]  Glucosamine in certain high doses may have inhibitory effects, according to the science
[3:40:27.320 --> 3:40:34.400]  paper, beta-glucans from yeast, but also various medicinal mushrooms contain beta-glucans,
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:40.000]  which are widely known for anti-cancer potential as well, so beta-glucans is something to look
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  at.
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:45.800]  Zinc helps your skin repair itself after injury.
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:52.400]  Zinc is very important for immune function and blocking infections of common influenza,
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:53.400]  for example.
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:57.360]  There's a tremendous amount of research about zinc blocking influenza, and then finally
[3:40:57.360 --> 3:41:02.280]  there's elderberry, and we've talked about that on the show here over the past few days.
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:05.840]  Elderberry extracts, they're kind of sold out everywhere at the moment, but they're very,
[3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:10.160]  very effective at blocking viral replication in your body.
[3:41:10.160 --> 3:41:13.400]  So if you can get some elderberry extract, it's delicious.
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:15.840]  I've used it for many, many years.
[3:41:15.840 --> 3:41:18.040]  It's purple, like a dark purple color.
[3:41:18.040 --> 3:41:20.200]  I would definitely have elderberry.
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:24.160]  And then not mentioned in this study, though, was high-dose vitamin C. We had a guest on
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:30.040]  last week who was an orthomolecular physician talking about the clinical use of high-dose
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:35.960]  vitamin C, which is where you go into a clinic with an IV in your arm, and they'll put something
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:42.280]  like 50 grams of vitamin C into your bloodstream more than you could take orally without causing
[3:41:42.280 --> 3:41:44.360]  some kind of digestive distress.
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:48.520]  So 50 grams, boom, it just kills all kinds of pathogens all throughout your system.
[3:41:48.520 --> 3:41:52.080]  Now, that's something, obviously, you need a qualified naturopathic physician.
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:53.960]  That's not a do-it-yourself type of thing.
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:58.480]  Oh, jabbing yourself in the arm with a needle, that's not a great way to beat the virus.
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:01.440]  Make sure you get qualified medical assistance.
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:02.440]  You go to a clinic.
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:07.760]  The people are trained, they know what they're doing, just do all this safely.
[3:42:07.760 --> 3:42:09.840]  So that's the takeaway from this segment here.
[3:42:09.840 --> 3:42:15.840]  I've got more news on the other side, but bottom line is, why isn't Trump out there
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:20.800]  saying people could do these things right now instead of just waiting for a vaccine?
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:22.920]  I don't want to wait 18 months for a vaccine.
[3:42:22.920 --> 3:42:24.280]  I'm not going to take that vaccine anyway.
[3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:28.920]  It might be deadlier than the virus, but all these other things I mentioned, you can find
[3:42:28.920 --> 3:42:29.920]  them now.
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:33.120]  They're safe, affordable, effective, and they might work.
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:34.680]  They might save lives.
[3:42:34.680 --> 3:42:36.480]  Very likely, they will do that.
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:39.600]  We don't know for sure, but a very high probability.
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:44.720]  So much more on the other side, we're going to break, but this is Mike Adams here, naturalnews.com,
[3:42:44.720 --> 3:42:51.600]  with InfoWars and the Alex Jones show, we'll be back after this break.
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:54.560]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[3:42:54.560 --> 3:42:58.160]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling a strain from
[3:42:58.160 --> 3:42:59.280]  rising pressure.
[3:42:59.280 --> 3:43:02.920]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress
[3:43:02.920 --> 3:43:04.400]  in your hectic day.
[3:43:04.400 --> 3:43:08.760]  Chill Force is our solution for a true, healthy, relaxation support formula.

[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:23.920]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine, because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[3:45:23.920 --> 3:45:28.200]  the bad halogen, and people told me about it for years, and I didn't listen, and I'm
[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:34.040]  so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago, and started taking
[3:45:34.040 --> 3:45:37.400]  true iodine, atomic iodine.
[3:45:37.400 --> 3:45:43.080]  We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com, and I'm telling

[3:46:02.120 --> 3:46:03.120]  Yeah.
[3:46:03.120 --> 3:46:06.320]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man, I love women, you ought to go out and get
[3:46:06.320 --> 3:46:07.320]  a girlfriend.

[3:46:50.800 --> 3:46:55.800]  independent.
[3:46:55.800 --> 3:47:11.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:17.560]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:17.560 --> 3:47:21.000]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:29.120]  In that last segment, I totally forgot to mention colloidal silver, so I want to show
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:30.620]  you this.
[3:47:30.620 --> 3:47:36.120]  This right here, this is a piece of pure silver, it's a silver rod, and I've put an electrical
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:38.200]  connector on the end here.
[3:47:38.200 --> 3:47:44.960]  I had these custom made, they're four millimeters in diameter, pure silver, 99.99 plus percent.
[3:47:44.960 --> 3:47:48.760]  And this is how industrial level colloidal silver is made.
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:53.640]  You can attach your electrical connectors right here, this is the size of a banana plug
[3:47:53.640 --> 3:47:57.000]  of like a low voltage DC power supply.
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:00.520]  And you can find a lot of recipes online if you want to try to make it yourself, it's
[3:48:00.520 --> 3:48:02.160]  not bad to do that.
[3:48:02.160 --> 3:48:06.800]  But it's also good to have it professionally made and filtered and quality controlled as
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:07.800]  InfoWarsStore offers.
[3:48:07.800 --> 3:48:12.120]  I just want to mention that colloidal silver has a lot of potential uses, especially for
[3:48:12.120 --> 3:48:13.920]  surface sanitation.
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:16.840]  You can also get colloidal silver, you can gargle with it.
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:19.360]  You can add it to a nasal irrigator.
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:25.360]  So some people like to have like a soft syringe, you put salt in some warm water and you kind
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:28.720]  of squirt through your nasal passages.
[3:48:28.720 --> 3:48:33.240]  And I've even done that in times when I've had sort of sinus infections in the past,
[3:48:33.240 --> 3:48:34.340]  it works really well.
[3:48:34.340 --> 3:48:38.160]  You can mix colloidal silver with that, so you're not actually swallowing it, it's just
[3:48:38.160 --> 3:48:42.600]  coming out of your other nasal passage by the way.
[3:48:42.600 --> 3:48:45.640]  It's good to do that in a shower, otherwise it makes kind of a mess.
[3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:48.880]  You can irrigate your nasal passage, you can gargle with it.
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:55.400]  And I suppose in an emergency, you could swallow it under the direction of a nature path if
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:48:57.320]  you thought that's the best option for you.
[3:48:57.320 --> 3:48:58.320]  Consider all the options.
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:03.200]  I don't think that you should drink colloidal silver on a daily basis like a supplement.
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:07.280]  You don't need silver like a mineral, you don't need it like magnesium or selenium.
[3:49:07.280 --> 3:49:10.360]  But in an emergency, would I consider consuming it orally?
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:11.360]  Absolutely.
[3:49:11.360 --> 3:49:16.600]  In fact, I've got gallons of it sitting around for that very purpose just in case it's needed.
[3:49:16.600 --> 3:49:20.360]  And besides, the vaccines aren't going to be around for a long time, maybe a year and
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:23.560]  a half, and who knows if big pharma drugs are ever going to work or if you're going
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:26.080]  to have any supply or if the vaccine might kill you.
[3:49:26.080 --> 3:49:27.080]  Who knows?
[3:49:27.080 --> 3:49:30.080]  So why not have all the options available to you?
[3:49:30.080 --> 3:49:36.280]  And silver is great because with silver, you have something that can help sanitize surfaces
[3:49:36.280 --> 3:49:41.840]  as well as theoretically be used internally in an emergency under medical direction.
[3:49:41.840 --> 3:49:47.920]  The other thing I like is if you go back to this silver rod here that I'm showing on camera,
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:52.520]  you can also, what I like to do as a preparer is I buy precious metals.
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:57.960]  So this is pure silver that can be melted down and traded as silver.
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:02.440]  So if you buy silver rods and if you study up and you know how to make some of this yourself
[3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:07.320]  in an emergency, it's a dual-use mineral, you could trade it in barter or you could
[3:50:07.320 --> 3:50:08.880]  use it to make more colloidal silver.
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:15.400]  So it's really awesome that nature has provided this just fabulous element that can be used
[3:50:15.400 --> 3:50:19.680]  for medicine, it can be used for money, it can be used as an antibacterial treatment
[3:50:19.680 --> 3:50:21.640]  for surfaces in hospitals.
[3:50:21.640 --> 3:50:22.680]  It's amazing.
[3:50:22.680 --> 3:50:26.080]  And this is on the table of elements, this was created by God, you know, this is part
[3:50:26.080 --> 3:50:29.880]  of the physics of the universe, just like gold and just like copper, which is also antibacterial
[3:50:29.880 --> 3:50:30.880]  by the way.
[3:50:30.880 --> 3:50:31.880]  Copper is.
[3:50:31.880 --> 3:50:34.880]  Gold is very, very neutral.
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:36.880]  But this is provided by nature.
[3:50:36.880 --> 3:50:43.400]  So to definitely check that out, if I were you, I would load up on some commercial colloidal
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:47.960]  silver, but I would also learn how to make it in an emergency yourself.
[3:50:47.960 --> 3:50:49.600]  You can, yeah, you can just get silver wire.
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:53.880]  In fact, I'm going to be filming a video soon that just kind of shows some, how to make
[3:50:53.880 --> 3:50:58.080]  your own hand sanitizer, like I said earlier, I'm going to show you a video.
[3:50:58.080 --> 3:51:02.640]  But you can also, you can take colloidal silver at a bottle and you can spray your mask.
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:08.200]  So if you have an N95 mask and you want to add an extra layer of silver to the mask,
[3:51:08.200 --> 3:51:09.200]  you can mist it.
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:13.880]  And you don't want to saturate it, but you can mist it with colloidal silver on the outside
[3:51:13.880 --> 3:51:16.080]  of the mask and the inside of the mask.
[3:51:16.080 --> 3:51:18.920]  And what that does is it provides one more layer of protection.
[3:51:18.920 --> 3:51:23.720]  If a pathogen happens to attach onto the mask, then it's more likely to be killed by the
[3:51:23.720 --> 3:51:26.200]  silver before you can inhale it.
[3:51:26.200 --> 3:51:31.520]  So it's multiple layers of strategic thinking about this as a prepper, as someone who believes
[3:51:31.520 --> 3:51:35.360]  in hard money, you know, gold and silver and precious metals and so on.
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:40.920]  And, and by the way, just as a little ding to those of you out there who are into crypto,
[3:51:40.920 --> 3:51:45.160]  you can't turn cryptocurrency into medicine, by the way, but you can, you can turn silver
[3:51:45.160 --> 3:51:47.640]  into medicine.
[3:51:47.640 --> 3:51:49.360]  Just had to say that for fun.
[3:51:49.360 --> 3:51:51.880]  I do think crypto is going to go up, by the way, during this whole crisis.
[3:51:51.880 --> 3:51:53.640]  So that's, that's a totally separate topic.
[3:51:53.640 --> 3:51:59.440]  Now, I want to get to an article today that was written by Brandon Smith from Alt Market.
[3:51:59.440 --> 3:52:00.440]  That's alt-market.com.
[3:52:00.440 --> 3:52:03.000]  I reprinted it on natural news.
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:04.680]  It's a very important article.
[3:52:04.680 --> 3:52:09.360]  I think it's one of the best that Brandon has ever covered on this because he lays out
[3:52:09.360 --> 3:52:13.640]  what he thinks is the scenario, what's going to happen over the next year.
[3:52:13.640 --> 3:52:19.440]  And I really encourage you to read this article because he's talking about multiple community
[3:52:19.440 --> 3:52:20.440]  outbreaks in the U.S.
[3:52:20.440 --> 3:52:25.480]  He's talking about medical martial law, travel lockdowns, that is shutting down domestic
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:28.360]  air travel and highways, roadways and so on.
[3:52:28.360 --> 3:52:32.960]  Now, that's something that Stuart Rhodes also recommended in the last hour that you heard.
[3:52:32.960 --> 3:52:34.800]  And I'm an advocate of that as well.
[3:52:34.800 --> 3:52:39.440]  If you follow the math that I explained in the last segment, if Trump doesn't do something
[3:52:39.440 --> 3:52:43.920]  to stop domestic air travel, then this will continue to double every week until it's over
[3:52:43.920 --> 3:52:46.080]  a million people infected.
[3:52:46.080 --> 3:52:50.000]  So at some point, you're going to have to stop the air travel unless you decide to just
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:54.600]  let everybody get infected and lose 10% of the population, but that's not a good strategy.
[3:52:54.600 --> 3:52:56.040]  So at some point, you have to stop air travel.
[3:52:56.040 --> 3:52:57.160]  You have to quarantine cities.
[3:52:57.160 --> 3:52:59.280]  You have to have medical martial law.
[3:52:59.280 --> 3:53:00.780]  That's probably coming.
[3:53:00.780 --> 3:53:02.720]  And then you're going to have forced vaccinations.
[3:53:02.720 --> 3:53:06.240]  Probably you're going to have interference in the elections coming up, which is something
[3:53:06.240 --> 3:53:07.720]  that I've mentioned.
[3:53:07.720 --> 3:53:11.200]  But Brandon also mentioned something else that's very disturbing.
[3:53:11.200 --> 3:53:17.360]  He believes that at some point, the Trump administration will seize websites like infowars.com and
[3:53:17.360 --> 3:53:20.440]  naturalnews.com and shut them all down.
[3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:22.420]  Now I hope that's not the case.
[3:53:22.420 --> 3:53:23.680]  I really hope that's not the case.
[3:53:23.680 --> 3:53:26.000]  I don't think Trump has any intention to do that.
[3:53:26.000 --> 3:53:28.360]  I don't think he would do that.
[3:53:28.360 --> 3:53:30.000]  But there might be people pressuring him to do that.
[3:53:30.000 --> 3:53:34.520]  There might be State Department people who try to do it outside of Trump's permission.
[3:53:34.520 --> 3:53:38.480]  There's going to be an effort to shut down the voices of truth that are reporting what's
[3:53:38.480 --> 3:53:42.040]  happening with this virus or even reporting about natural cures.
[3:53:42.040 --> 3:53:46.160]  Maybe if we talk about colloidal silver like we just did, we'll be banned, not just banned
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:49.440]  but seized, shut down.
[3:53:49.440 --> 3:53:54.720]  So one day you type in infowars.com in your browser and you get a message that says, this
[3:53:54.720 --> 3:53:59.440]  has been taken over by the State Department for spreading dangerous misinformation during
[3:53:59.440 --> 3:54:02.080]  a time of great national emergency.
[3:54:02.080 --> 3:54:05.760]  That's the kind of message you're going to see and you'll see the same thing on my website.
[3:54:05.760 --> 3:54:11.360]  So you need to think about alternatives, newswars.com or summit.news, Paul Joseph Watson's website.
[3:54:11.360 --> 3:54:16.000]  I've got other websites as well, hundreds of them actually, including pandemic.news and
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:17.960]  newstarget.com, whatever.
[3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:19.920]  We all need to think about alternatives.
[3:54:19.920 --> 3:54:24.720]  And most importantly, those of you watching, you need to subscribe to the info wars email
[3:54:24.720 --> 3:54:32.240]  list because the email list is the one way that info wars will be able to reach you if
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:37.600]  the info wars.com domain is seized by maybe not Trump, but somebody else in the administration
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:38.680]  try to shut this down.
[3:54:38.680 --> 3:54:40.680]  This is the prediction of Brandon Smith.
[3:54:40.680 --> 3:54:43.120]  I'm not sure that he's right, but he may not be wrong about that.
[3:54:43.120 --> 3:54:44.620]  I don't know.
[3:54:44.620 --> 3:54:49.480]  We're going to see where it goes, but join the info wars.com email list and let me give
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:53.440]  you some advice on this as we deliver, you know, hundreds of thousands of emails every
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:54:54.440]  day as well.
[3:54:54.440 --> 3:54:55.680]  Let me tell you something.
[3:54:55.680 --> 3:55:02.960]  Do not sign up using Gmail or Yahoo Mail or Hotmail or any Microsoft Mail service.
[3:55:02.960 --> 3:55:09.200]  You need to use a service such as protonmail.com or hushmail or something else that will not
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:17.720]  be censored because there is censorship at the email ISP level against independent media.
[3:55:17.720 --> 3:55:20.080]  I'm not going to bore you with the details.
[3:55:20.080 --> 3:55:21.080]  Just trust me, it's taking place.
[3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:23.880]  There are days when Google just says, oh, we're not going to deliver the natural news
[3:55:23.880 --> 3:55:24.880]  email newsletter.
[3:55:24.880 --> 3:55:26.160]  We're not going to deliver info wars.
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:27.960]  It happens.
[3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:30.960]  So sign up to the email newsletter.
[3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:36.520]  Be prepared to use alternative websites to access information.
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:42.520]  Be prepared to use band.video or brighttown.com and hey, maybe both of those might get seized
[3:55:42.520 --> 3:55:43.600]  for all we know.
[3:55:43.600 --> 3:55:48.320]  It's impossible to tell where this is going, but if you start looking at millions of people
[3:55:48.320 --> 3:55:52.440]  potentially getting infected and then over time, in a worst case scenario, millions of
[3:55:52.440 --> 3:55:57.680]  people dying, the government is probably based on current trends, especially if Mike Pence
[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:04.640]  is still in charge, which I hope he isn't, of this, he's not qualified on this, but they
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:08.920]  could literally shut down independent media and say it's a national emergency.
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:14.520]  The executive orders already exist under President Obama in 2012, I believe he signed executive
[3:56:14.520 --> 3:56:19.520]  orders that gave him the right to seize media, seize farms and food and firearms and ammunition
[3:56:19.520 --> 3:56:23.080]  and all medicine, all fuel, everything nationwide.
[3:56:23.080 --> 3:56:26.320]  And those executive orders are still on the books.
[3:56:26.320 --> 3:56:28.560]  Trump has not rescinded those executive orders.
[3:56:28.560 --> 3:56:31.080]  He could theoretically invoke them.
[3:56:31.080 --> 3:56:35.800]  Again, I'm not saying in any way that Trump has any intention to do this, in fact, I hope
[3:56:35.800 --> 3:56:40.600]  Trump will fight the tech giants and restore freedom of speech for the independent media
[3:56:40.600 --> 3:56:46.840]  since we are really the only voices that are still pro-Trump remaining in America.
[3:56:46.840 --> 3:56:51.840]  If Trump has infowars and natural news taken down and others like zero hedge and Gateway
[3:56:51.840 --> 3:56:55.840]  pundit, who knows, then there's nobody left to speak for Trump, basically.
[3:56:55.840 --> 3:56:59.760]  So hopefully that's never going to happen and I don't think it will, but Brandon Smith
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:04.640]  has put out this warning and I think it's time that we all started taking precautions
[3:57:04.640 --> 3:57:06.480]  in case those scenarios unfold.
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:08.920]  So that's my message today.
[3:57:08.920 --> 3:57:10.520]  We're headed into some very strange times.
[3:57:10.520 --> 3:57:14.680]  There's going to be a lot of censorship, going to be a lot of panic, a lot of suffering,
[3:57:14.680 --> 3:57:19.760]  a lot of death, unless there's some miraculous intervention that happens quickly.
[3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:21.600]  This is spiraling out of control.
[3:57:21.600 --> 3:57:26.240]  It's all over California, Oregon, Washington, it's in New York, it's in 12 plus states across
[3:57:26.240 --> 3:57:27.240]  America.
[3:57:27.240 --> 3:57:28.760]  It's not going to be over anytime soon.
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:32.720]  Mike Adams here, the Health Ranger for naturalnews.com and the Alex Jones show.
[3:57:32.720 --> 3:57:33.720]  Thank you for joining me today.
[3:57:33.720 --> 3:57:34.720]  Stay safe, get prepared.
[3:57:34.720 --> 3:58:01.880]  Until next time, be well.
