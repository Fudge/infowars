[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:32.160]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.160 --> 00:38.080]  I spent some of the morning watching C-SPAN and Rand Paul grilling Hillary Clinton,
[00:38.080 --> 00:45.600]  pointing out that if he was the president, he would have relieved her of her position.
[00:45.600 --> 00:52.240]  We have that clip coming up. And that's the point. When quote, government screwed up in the past,
[00:52.240 --> 00:59.200]  or in any other country for that matter, the people responsible for it resign or go to jail.
[01:01.120 --> 01:05.360]  But nowadays, the answer is give us more funding. And that's what Hillary Clinton said.
[01:05.360 --> 01:11.680]  That's why whenever FEMA ordered the police to stand down during Katrina on Bush's watch,
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.120]  FEMA then got even more funding saying we need more power.
[01:16.640 --> 01:23.040]  They've engineered that into the system. It's just an amazing level of corruption.
[01:23.040 --> 01:30.800]  But you see, watching the Senate hearings with Hillary, only part of it is being covered.
[01:30.800 --> 01:38.160]  Because our government armed the Libyan al-Qaeda rebels out of Saudi Arabia,
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.240]  who first came from Saudi Arabia and other countries, into Benghazi two years ago,
[01:42.240 --> 01:48.560]  to destabilize and take down Libya. They were on the BBC saying, next stop, Damascus, Syria.
[01:49.440 --> 01:52.640]  They've been there. They've been given heat-seeking missiles.
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.040]  Some numbers are as high as 15,000. Most numbers are around 12,000.
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.480]  10,000 of those heat seekers, pretty high tech. Take down any jet airliner you want.
[02:02.480 --> 02:07.200]  They've been attacking jet airliners, shooting them up, passenger liners.
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.880]  And then the media thinks you're so stupid, they go, we have to give our rights up and
[02:12.880 --> 02:17.920]  invade all over Africa and Algeria and Mali because al-Qaeda's there.
[02:17.920 --> 02:22.960]  And then our criminal-occupied government uses that as a pretext with NATO and France
[02:22.960 --> 02:28.480]  to invade Mali and Algeria and other areas. I mean, it's amazing. We predicted,
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.120]  four years ago in the Obama deception, they would use al-Qaeda that they control
[02:33.120 --> 02:38.240]  to invade all over Africa because we know how they operate. And we saw the buildup of AFRICON.
[02:38.240 --> 02:45.520]  So the truth is 100% in plain sight. The truth is 100% in plain sight.
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.920]  The truth is 100% in plain view, but it's so over the top, everyone would have to say,
[02:51.920 --> 02:56.400]  you're right, Alex, we apologize. The globalists have hijacked our country around al-Qaeda.
[02:56.400 --> 03:01.120]  And the media spins that and says, you're saying George W. Bush had a plunger at the World Trade
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.920]  Center. You're saying everybody in the government, the guy that delivers letters to your post office
[03:05.920 --> 03:12.880]  box, he's behind it. That's the games they play. No, criminal, globalist, cartel elements,
[03:12.880 --> 03:17.840]  infiltrating the CIA, FBI, NSA, the National Security Council.
[03:18.480 --> 03:21.680]  They financed the politicians that get into power, the foreign banks.
[03:21.680 --> 03:27.600]  They have put their people in, and they're using al-Qaeda to destabilize and overthrow governments
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.160]  or attack Western governments as a pretext for the Western government to then crack down
[03:32.160 --> 03:36.800]  the general population. And I've been saying that for 11 years, and now it's all public.
[03:36.800 --> 03:44.080]  Oh, don't worry about al-Qaeda. This is now for the general public.
[03:44.080 --> 03:47.760]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down today. And then there's articles like
[03:47.760 --> 03:54.480]  this out of CNS News. Former Special Forces Commander, top general, was US running guns
[03:54.480 --> 04:02.960]  to Syrian rebels via Benghazi? CIA says no. General Boykin goes on to say that the evidence
[04:02.960 --> 04:09.040]  points towards them doing this. Well, the evidence doesn't point towards it, it's on
[04:09.040 --> 04:15.840]  record that our government, NATO, all run by the mega banks, on record, brought al-Qaeda
[04:15.840 --> 04:20.000]  into Libya, then brought them into Syria, invaded from three different countries, and
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.200]  have had Turkish artillery backing them up, and CIA commandos, and British commandos,
[04:25.200 --> 04:34.560]  and Saudi Arabian commandos, in there, helping attack, over the last 20 plus months, Syria.
[04:34.560 --> 04:40.160]  I mean, the Turkish ambassador was there, the missile cache was there, there was some
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.400]  double cross, or they wanted to get rid of the witness to it, and they killed the ambassador
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.400]  in order to stand down for eight hours. And the people they used to kill in the al-Qaeda
[04:48.400 --> 04:55.360]  forces were the US certified, NATO certified security for Benghazi. Okay, that's what happened,
[04:55.360 --> 05:19.840]  open and shut, period, done, and the whole government knows it.

[08:14.640 --> 08:24.960]  Rallying patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:29.360 --> 08:36.720]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen. It is the 23rd day of January 2013 on this Wednesday edition.
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.200]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour because we're tracking it live right now. We'll give
[08:41.200 --> 08:48.080]  you the latest on Hillary Clinton's testimony to the Senate Committee. Rand Paul to Hillary
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.800]  Clinton. If I were a president, I would have relieved you of your post. We're going to be
[08:52.800 --> 08:59.520]  going over that. Former Special Forces Commander, retired General William G. Boykin,
[09:00.400 --> 09:06.880]  who literally was at the heart of the CIA and black operations, is saying that he believes
[09:06.880 --> 09:13.840]  that they were funding and giving missiles and weapons to Al Qaeda-based Syrian rebels.
[09:14.880 --> 09:19.120]  Well, I mean, that's not even debatable. That's like saying, I believe the sun came up this
[09:19.120 --> 09:25.280]  morning. I mean, it's New York Times, Associated Press, LA Times in the last six months, Council
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.280]  on Foreign Relations. We told you about it 22 months ago when the whole thing started.
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.920]  It's a plan to turn the entire Middle East over to Wahhabist, Al Qaeda run by Saudi Arabia,
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.520]  itself run by the mega banks. So at the bottom of the hour, I'll do a special report on that
[09:41.520 --> 09:45.040]  and give you the latest. In fact, we have a skeleton crew today. One of our guys is out
[09:45.040 --> 09:52.800]  taking care of a sick child. It's in yesterday's stack. Can you guys re-pull the London Independent
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.000]  and a couple others where the Prime Minister of Algeria is saying the West is behind these
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.320]  stage terror attacks as a pretext to invade our countries? There's guys with blonde hair and blue
[10:02.320 --> 10:08.000]  eyes attacking our facilities. And then they pull out and then the West gets to come in.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.440]  See, I've seen this over and over again. Operation Gladio, Ajax, Tonkin,
[10:14.240 --> 10:19.760]  staging events are even having real attacks. Northwoods talks about shooting up Americans
[10:19.760 --> 10:26.800]  in shopping malls and movie theaters and on the streets. Declassified in 2000, September 2000.
[10:26.800 --> 10:32.640]  And the plan was killed by President Kennedy, but later given a new name and engaged him.
[10:32.640 --> 10:37.520]  That's why we have to say, could these events be staged? And then when they have the telltale signs,
[10:37.520 --> 10:44.960]  then it moves into, it's a probability they are, especially Colorado. I mean, that is cartoon level
[10:44.960 --> 10:50.160]  where he's getting DARPA funding and mind control. He's got a top Air Force psychiatrist who'd been
[10:50.160 --> 10:56.000]  the head of whole operations at entire bases in San Antonio. Over him, meeting with him multiple
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.360]  times a week. They're talking about national security and the police don't want. It released
[11:01.360 --> 11:07.920]  his workbook with her, where he reportedly was planning to do all this. You want me to keep going?
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.200]  Witnesses of multiple shooters, all the rest of it. Him in the jail saying, I don't remember who
[11:13.200 --> 11:19.040]  I am, obviously drugged out of his mind. I mean, we already knew this, but it came out in the LA
[11:19.040 --> 11:29.120]  Times that Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was under CIA mind control. And it was declassified
[11:30.080 --> 11:36.960]  that he had been a volunteer to MK Ultra and had disappeared into the program for close to 30
[11:36.960 --> 11:42.960]  years. He entered it in the mid 60s as a PhD student, disappears for decades, and starts
[11:42.960 --> 11:52.240]  bombing prominent scientists and people. And his letters are how we've got to exterminate
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.960]  the majority of humanity or they're going to destroy the Earth, but the elite are planning
[11:56.960 --> 12:00.160]  to kill us anyways, so we've got to stop that. I mean, what is this?
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.880]  And the media is like, Alex Jones thinks it's mind control, no such thing. I mean,
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.840]  they probably had more than 30 mainstream articles, Daily Beast, you name it. Time
[12:13.840 --> 12:19.360]  Magazine saying for some reason, Jones went and watched Batman and found Sandy Hook in it,
[12:19.360 --> 12:25.600]  and now says it's behind it. No, no, we said before Batman came out that from analyzing it
[12:25.600 --> 12:30.560]  and the previous franchise, it is a film full of psychological triggers.
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.920]  And then the movie comes out and Sandy Hook's in it. And then we find out hundreds of media people
[12:35.920 --> 12:42.480]  were mailed Bain command charts showing the mass terror attack points like Sandy Hook and others.
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.440]  They're like, well, this is bizarre. I know it's bizarre. This is the gang signs
[12:49.440 --> 12:53.760]  the globalists also use to communicate with each other. I don't believe in all this,
[12:53.760 --> 12:56.880]  they do. I don't go to Bohemian Grove and worship a big owl.
[12:56.880 --> 13:06.400]  I'm not Jimmy Savelle, the top royal confidant, who it turns out is a Satanist and a mass child
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.360]  molester running big children's charities and hanging out and having keys and the highest
[13:11.360 --> 13:17.120]  national security clearances into the royal family and bragging, I supply them things.
[13:17.120 --> 13:23.280]  And they've declared national security on that. They just declared national security on him,
[13:23.280 --> 13:30.160]  quote, supplying things. He publicly brag at elite parties with the Prime Minister's
[13:30.160 --> 13:37.760]  and the Queen and Prince Charles and all of them. And the guy is a devil worshiping pedophile.
[13:43.760 --> 13:47.280]  And by the way, I've analyzed that the main banking structure is moving to Frankfurt,
[13:47.280 --> 13:53.600]  Germany. This is high level blackmail by the European Illuminati against the British Empire.
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.280]  High level wars going on. That's why this is being released now that he's dead.
[13:57.280 --> 14:02.400]  This has been known for decades at the BBC where he worked. And they're now going,
[14:02.400 --> 14:06.800]  you're gonna do what we say, we're gonna run the New World Order. Cuz the Skeksis are all battling
[14:07.920 --> 14:13.920]  over the throne right now. The New World Order is almost complete. It's entering the endgame.
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.880]  It's entering the endgame. And now they're gonna start battling over who gets the throne,
[14:18.880 --> 14:22.560]  who gets the ring of Mordor, of Morgoth.
[14:26.480 --> 14:29.840]  And you wonder why everything they do is so diabolical and so twisted and so
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.320]  evil and so sick and so filthy. I mean, if you're a new listener and you're like, well,
[14:36.320 --> 14:45.920]  who's Jimmy Savelle? Well, who's Jerry Sandusky? Raping children in front of people at high noon
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.280]  in a field house, which is like the main entrance of an airport.
[14:52.560 --> 14:56.560]  You've never been inside a field house. I mean, it's people coming and going constantly,
[14:56.560 --> 14:58.640]  even at night, especially to college.
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.760]  And then of course it came out higher, the whole top of the university was covering it up.
[15:05.760 --> 15:11.520]  Of course, he was just the procurer of the children. You're like, man, Alex,
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.480]  why are you telling us this? Because they're monsters, that's why. You don't get into the
[15:16.480 --> 15:22.800]  club with these people unless you are very, very, very, very sick.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.040]  And I've talked a lot about this because he wrote about it. Hitler loved to go to the front
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.120]  in Poland and France and then with Russia until they started getting beaten.
[15:35.120 --> 15:37.600]  Then he pulled back to the wolf's lair, the wolf's den,
[15:41.760 --> 15:50.880]  his forest bunkers. And he would sit there with big telescopes from 10 miles away.
[15:50.880 --> 15:54.560]  But with a big telescope, crystal clear, watching people getting killed,
[15:54.560 --> 15:59.920]  watching things burn, watching people jumping out of tall windows. And they say he would stay up
[15:59.920 --> 16:07.040]  sometimes for days taking amphetamines and eating pastry after pastry. He could not draw himself
[16:07.040 --> 16:14.800]  away from watching his bombers bomb and burn major cities. And he just described it as absolutely
[16:14.800 --> 16:26.080]  beautiful. And so you need to figure out, folks, if you don't tie government down with the chains
[16:26.080 --> 16:31.440]  of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, if you don't put government on a very short leash,
[16:31.440 --> 16:38.960]  it will put you on one. And I just went off into,
[16:41.120 --> 16:47.120]  and I'll cover it at the bottom of the hour after I get to Nightline at the bottom of the hour.
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.840]  I heard that last week, but then I was leaving town Thursday night to go out to the desert to
[16:53.840 --> 16:59.360]  do some hiking with my son and others. And would have brought my daughter, they're too
[16:59.360 --> 17:02.880]  little to hike four miles up a mountain. I'm surprised he did it, he did a pretty good job.
[17:07.040 --> 17:09.680]  We were ready to turn back anytime he wanted to, but he said he wanted to go to the top.
[17:11.440 --> 17:19.760]  Rob Dew's son, who's even younger, climbed it too. So I heard you had Nightline
[17:19.760 --> 17:25.520]  did a piece on you, and I just figured it would be the piece they did two and a half years ago.
[17:27.840 --> 17:30.720]  And it is the old piece, but they added some new stuff to it.
[17:35.440 --> 17:40.320]  And it's another window into the mindset of these guys, because in the piece coming up,
[17:40.320 --> 17:46.960]  and I'm gonna recap this, you'll notice that he says, now I say, well, first you guys said
[17:46.960 --> 17:51.920]  there wasn't a world government. And now you're just saying, well, it's not a bad world government.
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.520]  And he goes, I'm not even saying there is a world government. Like what he says is what makes
[17:57.520 --> 18:03.760]  reality. Like when your child tells you, I didn't drink milk out of the jug, and you've got a
[18:03.760 --> 18:12.000]  mustache, I just saw you do it. Don't lie to me. And it's the same thing, and I say, that's why
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.920]  you're discredited. See, what you don't know is, 30 minutes before, they wanted to go shoot outside
[18:17.920 --> 18:24.320]  of the local park. 30 minutes before, we're in my office, right in out there, with a bunch of clips
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.800]  lined up of world leaders describing world government, congressional record on world government,
[18:28.800 --> 18:34.960]  CFR quotes, where they said it, what bi-monthly foreign affairs journal they said it.
[18:34.960 --> 18:38.960]  And I had it all for him, and he watched a few clips, and he goes, well, that's a different
[18:38.960 --> 18:43.680]  world government. That's a good world government, not the world government you're talking about.
[18:43.680 --> 18:47.680]  So 30 minutes later, I'm out there in a park where they wanna do a different part of the interview.
[18:48.240 --> 18:51.440]  And I go, first you say there's no world government, now you're saying it's not a bad
[18:51.440 --> 18:55.200]  world government, it's a different world government. He goes, no, I'm not even agreeing
[18:55.200 --> 19:00.720]  that there is one. And that's why I say, that's why you're discredited.
[19:01.760 --> 19:07.120]  But people watching that, see, I'm talking to him like he's a real person. And then he said,
[19:07.120 --> 19:12.400]  I went to dinner with him and I was nice. So that discredits me cuz I'm not this wild man
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.240]  in person. I was trying as a human to communicate with them cuz the guy's the host of ABC Nightly
[19:18.240 --> 19:23.920]  News. And that's still got four or five million viewers a night.
[19:23.920 --> 19:28.000]  That's still got some of the big old numbers of Dinosaur Media, one of the only bastions
[19:28.000 --> 19:36.400]  of it. Nightline has got two or three million. And I'm sitting there, and I'm sitting there
[19:36.400 --> 19:42.240]  like, and then they use that in the piece like, behind the scenes he was nice. And look,
[19:42.240 --> 19:46.640]  here he is throwing a football and he doesn't know anybody's watching. And my memory serves,
[19:46.640 --> 19:50.640]  they go, what's this football? You play football like that was bad. I go, yeah, with my son.
[19:50.640 --> 19:56.000]  We're like, here, let's toss it. I mean, they knew that that was being videotaped.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.920]  They imply that I was secretly throwing a football. I mean, it's bizarre.
[19:59.920 --> 20:06.320]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane
[20:06.320 --> 20:11.200]  Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous
[20:11.200 --> 20:16.080]  economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods Direct, we hear from

[20:26.080 --> 20:31.600]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

[22:02.960 --> 22:07.440]  going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression? Hi, Ted
[22:07.440 --> 22:12.480]  Anderson from Midas Resources. We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves
[22:12.480 --> 22:17.200]  in a move towards safety is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, US Treasuries are a safe
[22:17.200 --> 22:22.560]  haven. But what do you do when the US government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[22:22.560 --> 22:27.920]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[22:27.920 --> 22:33.280]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs,
[22:33.280 --> 22:37.680]  benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures. The book

[23:05.680 --> 23:12.640]  the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.520]  that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.640]  a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other tissues behave. I learned
[23:22.640 --> 23:26.720]  I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe.
[23:26.720 --> 23:32.880]  I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide
[23:32.880 --> 23:38.160]  me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA drops and order a free sample today.

[24:23.840 --> 24:28.160]  And when the system honors people that are subservient and go along to get along,
[24:28.160 --> 24:34.720]  it creates a perfect environment for the pathogen of very despotic megalomaniacal
[24:34.720 --> 24:42.960]  tyranny and tyrants to take control. And that's history. And that's what's so frustrating is that
[24:42.960 --> 24:48.000]  I sat there this morning for about an hour playing with my four-year-old daughter.
[24:48.000 --> 24:57.120]  And playing with the stuffed animals and playing with my little pony and playing hide-and-go-seek.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.640]  And I sat there while she was in her room after about an hour of playing with her. And I was
[25:02.640 --> 25:06.880]  going to tell her I had to go. I knew she was going to beg me not to leave. And I just thought,
[25:06.880 --> 25:14.880]  how do I take this stillness, this understanding that I have right now of how the world works
[25:14.880 --> 25:22.640]  and this deep sorrow and pain that is such a strength? And how do I transmit that and
[25:22.640 --> 25:29.840]  decipher that and encode that in words so that the general public can understand what I'm saying?
[25:29.840 --> 25:34.400]  But I know that by saying that fathers and mothers and grandmothers and grandfathers
[25:34.400 --> 25:39.920]  and brothers and sisters and sons and daughters, once the man, twice the child taking care of
[25:39.920 --> 25:45.280]  their parents, you know what I'm talking about, that all I wanna do is protect her.
[25:46.960 --> 25:55.280]  All I wanna do is have a good world for her. All I wanna do is lift up others so that she can
[25:55.280 --> 25:59.920]  commune with them and her grandchildren with their grandchildren and their grandchildren with
[25:59.920 --> 26:08.000]  their great-great-grandchildren. And it hurts me to my core that humanity may not make it.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.960]  We may not get to the point of a type one civilization, meaning we could survive if
[26:12.960 --> 26:20.880]  this planet was destroyed, and the incredible destiny that God has for us. If we don't stand
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.640]  up and do the right thing, God gave us a brain, God gave us a soul, a heart, and the power of
[26:27.840 --> 26:34.640]  his image as creators to build amazing things. And I know how great humanity is.
[26:34.640 --> 26:41.360]  And I can't imagine the world we would be in if the leaders of this planet were actually trying
[26:41.360 --> 26:47.280]  to empower humanity. They claim all day that their mission is to empower people. They claim
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.200]  all day, I watch clips, I've already seen them, but I watched a compilation
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.560]  at about 7 AM this morning of Joe Biden, we have it, if we have time later, we're gonna play it.
[26:58.560 --> 27:04.160]  Joe Biden, we have it, if we have time later, we're gonna play it.
[27:04.160 --> 27:11.120]  Of Joe Biden with relish, I mean, when you have discernment, it's not even discernment,
[27:11.120 --> 27:17.200]  anybody would see it. The relish he has when he talks about these beautiful children,
[27:17.200 --> 27:24.800]  shawl, shot up, just riddled with holes, riddled with holes. And he's clearly using it,
[27:24.800 --> 27:28.560]  pressing on the wound, putting salt in the wound, feeding off of it.
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.120]  I know his history, I know his background, I know how evil he is, I know how he works to
[27:33.120 --> 27:38.800]  deindustrialize America. I know how bad these guys are, I know their mindset, their code.
[27:39.440 --> 27:43.680]  And he's sitting there just sticking his finger in the wound like a bullet hole.
[27:43.680 --> 27:49.360]  And you say, I know it hurts. We finally, the image of these four-year-olds aren't even four.
[27:49.360 --> 27:56.160]  All shot up full of bullet holes. This with the parents, we're gonna get this done. And I realize
[27:56.160 --> 28:02.160]  they got drones killing in one country alone last year, 200 plus kids, Pakistan. Just seeing all
[28:02.160 --> 28:07.120]  collateral damage and putting al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria, 40,000 dead at least.
[28:07.120 --> 28:13.440]  Lining up blacks, videos of black men, women and children with al-Qaeda, because it's cheaper to
[28:13.440 --> 28:18.080]  use machetes. And plus they have more fun doing it, just hacking them up, just hacking their
[28:18.080 --> 28:23.360]  noses off, hacking their arms as they beg. I mean, stuff we won't even show you, it's on YouTube.
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.280]  They try to take it down as fast as they can, taking Christians and throwing them off
[28:27.280 --> 28:31.360]  five-story buildings and chopping their heads off and celebrating and saying,
[28:31.360 --> 28:36.240]  we're gonna destroy America, a la Akbar 9-11. We're coming, we've got the missiles,
[28:36.240 --> 28:42.080]  we're gonna kill you next. And our government, foreign banks, that's who they are, the occupiers,
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.440]  are doing this. And then I go and TSA wants me to take my shoes off and grope me to see if I'm
[28:47.440 --> 28:53.680]  al-Qaeda. I mean, I'm like, look, game over, joke over, scam over, no, no, no, no.
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.120]  And I realized why I blew up at Piers Morgan, I am physically angry.
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.800]  And not even at a hate level, it's more of just the anger of trying to burst through a foot of
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.440]  ice that you're trapped under. If you fall through a frozen lake, I mean, it's that kind of anger.
[29:09.440 --> 29:15.680]  I want out of here, I don't like this, get off my back. It's that feeling where two or three bullies
[29:15.680 --> 29:20.240]  are beating you up, and they get you down and they got you tackled. And you get beyond mad,
[29:20.240 --> 29:24.320]  you go, these people aren't gonna be on me in a minute. And you just decide to get up and stomp
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.440]  them. It's that kind of feeling like, I don't care anymore what happens to me. You people want
[29:29.440 --> 29:36.240]  to abuse children. You're a bunch of sick filth, and I will not stand here and watch you like
[29:36.240 --> 29:42.080]  ghouls use those little kids' deaths to disarm the American people. By the way, Australia took
[29:42.080 --> 29:48.080]  everything but single shot bolt action. They're now set to ban those. It's always the same story.
[29:48.080 --> 29:56.400]  We'll be back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.320 --> 30:04.560]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[30:04.560 --> 30:09.680]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[30:09.680 --> 30:14.720]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally
[30:14.720 --> 30:19.680]  as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[30:19.680 --> 30:25.440]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary
[30:25.440 --> 30:30.400]  exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.
[30:30.400 --> 30:34.640]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[30:34.640 --> 30:40.800]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[30:40.800 --> 30:46.560]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New

[33:19.760 --> 33:29.520]  That's www.supernaturalsilver.com.
[33:49.760 --> 33:54.620]  dot com is really on top of it. They're not bringing up, hey, why did our government use
[33:54.620 --> 33:57.200]  al-Qaeda to overthrow Libya to begin with?
[33:57.200 --> 34:03.320]  I mean, it's on record that NATO is arming them, and our military is the heart of NATO.
[34:03.320 --> 34:09.640]  So we need to be honest with ourselves about this, because if all this information is forced
[34:09.640 --> 34:15.340]  out there into the general consciousness and general awareness, it's game over. The establishment
[34:15.340 --> 34:21.240]  thinks you're so unconscious, so stupid, they're using real al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar
[34:21.240 --> 34:26.560]  and other countries, brought in over two years ago to Libya to start a almost year-long civil
[34:26.560 --> 34:34.480]  war with air raids and bombings of major cities and laying waste to whole neighborhoods.
[34:34.480 --> 34:47.600]  And it was called humanitarian because Obama is a Peace Prize winner. Just amazing. And
[34:47.600 --> 34:51.720]  then they use that same group and publicly exported them to Turkey, Jordan, and other
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.600]  areas to have them infiltrate the country publicly in attack. And they've got, this
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.000]  has been admitted for over a year in mainstream media, but it's back in the newspaper that
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.040]  Western commandos are advising them and training them. I mean, there are US bases in Turkey
[35:05.040 --> 35:09.580]  right on the border, and then the Syrians battle back against them.
[35:09.580 --> 35:15.360]  And so they open up for a few weeks with artillery to clear the area to send in the jihadis.
[35:15.360 --> 35:24.960]  And then I've seen some conservatives go, well, good, we got Arabs killing Arabs. And
[35:24.960 --> 35:30.120]  that's some bad karma right there. I don't mean karma in the Indian fashion, but you
[35:30.120 --> 35:36.200]  reap what you sow, what comes around goes around. I mean, really? That kind of so-called
[35:36.200 --> 35:37.680]  conservative is not a conservative.
[35:37.680 --> 35:47.440]  They are a fascistic, warped, dehumanizing person who has visions of power and reflected
[35:47.440 --> 35:53.260]  glory by smart bombs and artillery. I bet you a million dollars if you took one of those
[35:53.260 --> 35:57.580]  so-called good old boys, cuz most of them aren't really good old boys. And you stuck
[35:57.580 --> 36:02.840]  a gun in their hand and lined up ten little Afghan kids with snot coming out their nose
[36:02.840 --> 36:05.120]  or little eyes looking up at you.
[36:05.120 --> 36:12.120]  So ignorant that most of them can't even find the US on a map. I mean, these are like cavemen.
[36:12.120 --> 36:16.000]  I bet you those people would not have the nerve to pull the trigger on one of those
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.200]  kids, much less all ten of them. And if they did, they'd be basket cases and commit suicide
[36:21.200 --> 36:24.280]  later, like our troops do, by the way.
[36:24.280 --> 36:28.320]  You're not meant to go and kill a bunch of innocent kids. Your body, unless you're a
[36:28.320 --> 36:35.120]  full-born psychopath, genetically, if you're not totally evil and totally given over to
[36:35.120 --> 36:42.260]  evil from birth, doing evil things like that will destroy you. You will destroy yourself.
[36:42.260 --> 36:47.400]  Your body will hit the self-destruct switch. When you do good, you feel empowered and the
[36:47.400 --> 36:53.520]  universe opens up to you. When you do evil, you destroy yourself. That's a universal law.
[36:53.520 --> 37:01.060]  You don't have to even believe in God to know that that's the case.
[37:01.060 --> 37:04.480]  And our military men and women, most of them got in because they were poor or they had
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.200]  military background families or they genuinely cared about society and wanted to help. A
[37:09.200 --> 37:14.840]  small percentage, they become the contractors in a lot of cases, enjoy psychopathic killing.
[37:14.840 --> 37:20.760]  It's a place where they can go out and kill and get paid to do it. And they believe it's
[37:20.760 --> 37:29.800]  manly. Well, it might be manly if you've got to fight for your tribe to fight other men.
[37:29.800 --> 37:35.020]  But it is not manly to be like basically aliens from another planet with incredibly super
[37:35.020 --> 37:41.360]  high-tech weapons to come into Stone Age areas with people that don't even know who you are
[37:41.360 --> 37:45.560]  or your country is. They've done studies who will fight you just because they're still
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.560]  humans.
[37:46.560 --> 37:51.600]  They're primitive humans, but they still have their human programming. If there are invaders,
[37:51.600 --> 37:59.180]  I better fight them, which is what any group of humans has always done. And the globalist
[37:59.180 --> 38:03.520]  hire a bunch of Muslim terrorists to stage attacks, to carry out real attacks, or to
[38:03.520 --> 38:06.960]  take the Blamford attacks to attack the West so they can take all of our liberties.
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.880]  And I'm already getting into Benghazi now. We got two big guests today. We have Dr.
[38:10.880 --> 38:16.560]  Jim Garib, who's run the program to save 30 plus thousand Chinese girls. He's been nominated
[38:16.560 --> 38:22.360]  for the Nobel Prize. He says he's talked to a top military retired officer who told him
[38:22.360 --> 38:26.180]  that Obama is doing a litmus test, will you fire on US citizens?
[38:26.180 --> 38:29.320]  Now I believe he talked to this person, they told him that. In the article he wrote about
[38:29.320 --> 38:35.200]  it, adds the fact that they're buying a billion six bullets, armored vehicles, and the new
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.760]  army manuals. And so 10 say, train them to court in cities, confiscate guns, and shoot
[38:40.760 --> 38:47.120]  Americans. I can play ABC Nightly News in Katrina with the army officer saying, if you
[38:47.120 --> 38:49.160]  don't turn your guns in, we kill Americans.
[38:49.160 --> 38:55.600]  And by the way, a lot of that went on. It's the same ABC piece where the police chief
[38:55.600 --> 38:59.120]  says, all the guns will be taken, no one will be allowed to be armed. You just type in gun
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.280]  confiscation, New Orleans, there's NRA videos with millions of views on YouTube. If you're
[39:04.280 --> 39:07.080]  a new listener, I'm not gonna play it again, I've probably played it 100 times in the last
[39:07.080 --> 39:08.960]  six, seven years since Katrina, I'm not playing it again.
[39:08.960 --> 39:15.080]  You know it's there. For a couple of weeks, people denied gun confiscation was even happening.
[39:15.080 --> 39:21.600]  So he's gonna be joining us and then the main host of the Young Turks, Sink, is gonna be
[39:21.600 --> 39:28.040]  coming on the broadcast. We look forward to that for a lively discussion. And if we have
[39:28.040 --> 39:34.040]  time while he's on, Melissa Melton, I told her, one of our reporters and researchers,
[39:34.040 --> 39:41.160]  she actually in college, part of her degree is stats. So I said, listen, I just guesstimated
[39:41.160 --> 39:48.800]  off these FBI numbers, 49% and 21% drop in overall violent crime and gun crime.
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.240]  So I had her spend the last couple days breaking it down at FBI.gov. She's trying to export
[39:53.240 --> 39:58.000]  the video right now for radio. Listeners will post on Infowars, where we can show you that
[39:58.000 --> 40:04.520]  indeed my mental math was correct. Of course, I also saw them flash the numbers on Fox News
[40:04.520 --> 40:05.520]  and went and double checked it.
[40:05.520 --> 40:14.160]  They didn't even show the graphs. We're gonna show all those off FBI.gov. 49% drop, and
[40:14.160 --> 40:17.880]  I was wrong. I misunderstood it when I saw it on Fox. When I looked at the numbers myself,
[40:17.880 --> 40:24.640]  they just showed numbers. It's 49 in violent crime total in the last 20 years since 1991
[40:24.640 --> 40:28.000]  because the numbers are always about a year behind.
[40:28.000 --> 40:35.320]  Last numbers we have is 11, so they say since 1991. And then we have the other numbers.
[40:35.320 --> 40:41.040]  It's even higher. Illegal acts with guns has gone on even more because America's swimming
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.000]  in guns. Criminals have got their heads down. They go into immigrant areas where they know
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.240]  people aren't armed. The Chinese triads go and feed on the Chinese immigrants they know
[40:50.240 --> 40:55.380]  don't have a gun culture. The Mexican mafia goes and feeds on the poor Mexicans they know
[40:55.380 --> 40:58.760]  most of them don't have guns.
[40:58.760 --> 41:01.840]  Chicago, New York where the guns have been taken, the correct criminals go and feed on
[41:01.840 --> 41:07.440]  you and your family. I mean criminals do not do home invasions. I was looking at the numbers.
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.280]  It was over 100 times more common in Chicago than say in a small town in West Texas or
[41:13.280 --> 41:17.000]  even a big city like Dallas. I mean, they don't home invade while you're there. They
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.480]  make sure you're not there and then they still don't cuz I mean every day I read in the back
[41:22.480 --> 41:26.320]  of the paper where people kill somebody in their house.
[41:26.320 --> 41:29.400]  These criminals are so dumb the ones that are dumb enough in her house. They'll be like
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.120]  stop I have a gun and they keep coming with a machete or whatever. And they're always
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.120]  whacked out on drugs and they die. The criminals are on the run and that's why they're big
[41:37.120 --> 41:44.320]  overlord criminals. The big daddy criminals like Chicago mob boss, the godfather as he's
[41:44.320 --> 41:46.880]  called, Emanuel and Obama.
[41:46.880 --> 41:51.960]  Their instinct is don't hurt our criminal brethren. And they want the fear, they want
[41:51.960 --> 41:55.560]  to lock doors. They want you to have to call for more police which they then hire their
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.300]  own criminals to eat and then dominate you. They don't like the fact that most police
[42:00.300 --> 42:04.400]  are awake now. They don't like the fact that most forces aren't corrupt in the country.
[42:04.400 --> 42:08.640]  They want to convert us to a mafia system where they're above the law and safe and our
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.560]  gun culture is winning and taking over. Even Clinton said this last week, I'm yet to play
[42:12.560 --> 42:15.960]  the video, it was up at mfallwars.com.
[42:15.960 --> 42:20.460]  So they understand this is a desperate gamble for them. They've gotta kill the gun culture
[42:20.460 --> 42:25.360]  now because it's cancer to them, it's growing. This is a big surgery, they don't know they're
[42:25.360 --> 42:29.380]  gonna make it. They're in their doctor, can we cut out the Constitution? Rangel said it's
[42:29.380 --> 42:32.440]  our ultimate goal to get over the Constitution and Southerners.
[42:32.440 --> 42:38.460]  I love how they try to say it's Southerners that want guns. Folks, it's people all over
[42:38.460 --> 42:45.440]  this country want guns. I just saw a Tiananmen Square video from one of the hundreds of gun
[42:45.440 --> 42:50.440]  rallies of people with guns at the capitals, loaded in many cases, exercising the right.
[42:50.440 --> 42:55.240]  See, the system can't stand that. They wanna shame you and act like guns are already illegal.
[42:55.240 --> 42:57.960]  So when the carpet cleaners at your house, they call the cops on you. That's what these
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.620]  new laws they're proposing and new executive orders say is that if someone feels threatened
[43:02.620 --> 43:04.560]  by a gun at your house, go ahead and call the cops.
[43:04.560 --> 43:08.800]  They'll go ahead and take your guns, and then they'll make you go to a psychological evaluation.
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.280]  And they say just wanting guns is a sign of mental illness or not trusting government.
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.160]  Well, then America was founded on mental illness, and then we just got all the wealth and all
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.600]  the power cuz we had the liberty. I guess mental illness, you know what, if that's crazy,
[43:21.600 --> 43:28.680]  throw me in there, okay? You're right, you control free criminals, I absolutely hate
[43:28.680 --> 43:30.900]  you and know who you are, and I want nothing to do with you.
[43:30.900 --> 43:38.000]  And if you call that crazy, you bet I am. I'm as crazy as the day is long, you bet.
[43:38.000 --> 43:45.240]  Now let's go to this piece. This is Nightline. And this was two and a half years ago they
[43:45.240 --> 43:57.380]  came here. And you notice they don't even say, at least on the version I saw, yeah,
[43:57.380 --> 43:58.680]  and point out this is two and a half years old.
[43:58.680 --> 44:02.560]  It's like, we went and talked to Alex. And then they cut in the Piers Morgan appearance.
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.360]  And at the end they say, he'll now be under a lot of scrutiny, implying it was evil for
[44:07.360 --> 44:14.520]  me to say I have 50 guns. It was just a guesstimation, as if, my gosh, he's dangerous.
[44:14.520 --> 44:21.040]  And then they show me throwing the football. And then they imply, he's not always this
[44:21.040 --> 44:28.000]  crazy in person, it's all an act. Because there's a football in the back of the car
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  and we're getting in it.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.040]  They're like, you got a football, what's that? You relax. I go, well, yeah, of course I do.
[44:33.040 --> 44:38.080]  I have children, it's my son's football. And I'm like, here, you wanna catch it? And they
[44:38.080 --> 44:41.420]  cut it in going, when he didn't know the camera was rolling, he was playing football. That's
[44:41.420 --> 44:43.420]  not true.
[44:43.420 --> 44:47.720]  And then they say, he talked about many things with us not related to the New World Order.
[44:47.720 --> 44:51.740]  Talked about their family, stuff like that, went to dinner with them. I've told that story.
[44:51.740 --> 44:59.820]  But the point is, well, let's go ahead and start the piece. Here is Nightline implying
[44:59.820 --> 45:04.480]  I take bits and pieces. Here's that clip.
[45:04.480 --> 45:10.280]  We begin with America and its guns. As President Obama prepares to announce his sweeping plan
[45:10.280 --> 45:12.160]  to curb gun violence tomorrow.
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.800]  It paused, it paused. Back to the start, I've gotta just analyze the whole thing. I'm sorry,
[45:16.800 --> 45:21.600]  it'll take a few segments. Talk about a woman who loves the sound of her voice.
[45:21.600 --> 45:29.360]  America's guns, President Obama, President Obama. It's like some kind of weird confidence
[45:29.360 --> 45:34.000]  game. These people are a joke, reading off her teleprompter. And then they cut to the
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.720]  host of ABC Nightline as you came down here.
[45:36.720 --> 45:44.320]  And again, listen to this. And then they say, hey, that CNN piece about one child policies,
[45:44.320 --> 45:49.880]  that was tongue in cheeky, jokey. And you read the article, no, it wasn't. They just
[45:49.880 --> 45:53.800]  held turning like, yeah, drones are killing people. It's real cool, yeah. Yeah, we're
[45:53.800 --> 45:58.880]  setting up checkpoints on the highway to take blood, see, it's all done.
[45:58.880 --> 46:04.240]  That's part of their psych warfare. Everything's fine, see. Let's go back to the clip. Here
[46:04.240 --> 46:05.240]  it is.
[46:05.240 --> 46:10.400]  We begin with America and its guns. As President Obama prepares to announce his sweeping plan
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.360]  to curb gun violence tomorrow. Across the country, millions have already rushed out
[46:15.360 --> 46:21.720]  to buy a record number of new guns. And one man who thinks that's a very good thing, radio
[46:21.720 --> 46:24.080]  shock jock, Alex Jones.
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.440]  He made national headlines last week with a fiery pro-gun tirade that quickly-
[46:28.440 --> 46:36.000]  Backing up a few seconds, thank you. I'm a shock jock cuz, I mean, I think it's shocking
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.240]  that Rangel says we've got to overcome the Constitution and that Southerners are just
[46:39.240 --> 46:41.080]  bad people, period.
[46:41.080 --> 46:49.560]  I mean, wow. Imagine if he said Northeasterners, they're trash. I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.960]  And the Constitution is bad. I mean, Australian gun grabbers target bolt action rifles. They
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.400]  always take the semi-autos first, then the handguns, then the pistols, then the bolt
[46:58.400 --> 46:59.760]  actions, then the single shot.
[46:59.760 --> 47:03.600]  They want all guns turned in. We knew that was coming, they do that everywhere. This
[47:03.600 --> 47:12.000]  is how they do it. See, I find that shocking. I find it shocking that they pass the NDAA
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.160]  to secretly arrest and kill and disappear US citizens. I find it shocking that mega
[47:16.160 --> 47:19.160]  banks have been caught laundering hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money and don't
[47:19.160 --> 47:20.160]  get in trouble.
[47:20.160 --> 47:24.920]  But see, I'm a shock jock cuz I'm here going, wake up America, we're going into tyranny.
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.520]  But they just want you to be easy and cool and go watch a sitcom, have a martini. Hey
[47:29.520 --> 47:33.160]  man, everything's fine. I'm here to get you out of your coma. You see, that's why it was
[47:33.160 --> 47:34.160]  so shocking.
[47:34.160 --> 47:37.000]  They thought I was gonna come on and debate the First Amendment and should he be deported
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.240]  and they wanted talking points and we're gonna stick to this, aren't we? And he had Alan
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.840]  Dershowitz ready in the next segment. I went off the script, folks. It wasn't, they got
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.440]  me on there cuz they knew I'd blow up.
[47:50.440 --> 47:55.240]  They picked that up and broadcast that everywhere before they realized, wait a minute, this
[47:55.240 --> 48:01.000]  is actually waking people up, which it did, see. No weapon formed against us will prosper.
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.280]  Let's go back to Nightline with a recycled, re-edited piece. Here it is.
[48:06.280 --> 48:12.000]  Headlines last week with a fiery pro-gun tirade that quickly went viral. And that's not all
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.480]  he's got to say. Here's ABC's Dan Harris.
[48:16.480 --> 48:21.160]  Are you for Hitler or against Hitler? Whatever they say is the opposite. They never tell
[48:21.160 --> 48:22.160]  me.
[48:22.160 --> 48:24.720]  Let's just back it up to, I mean, what does that even mean? My point was you're either
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.200]  for Stalin or against Stalin. You're either for Hitler or against Hitler. You're either
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.600]  against this New World Order and all this ternary, or you're either for it or you're
[48:33.600 --> 48:34.600]  against it.
[48:34.600 --> 48:40.560]  It's very simple, but they just have a thing about Hitler. So people go, Hitler. I saw
[48:40.560 --> 48:50.360]  a piece David Knight did. It was one of the crew about Martin Luther King, it was Mike
[48:50.360 --> 48:56.520]  Adams. Martin Luther King and how he wouldn't support Obama. And I saw people commenting
[48:56.520 --> 49:01.400]  in there and they were serious. They go, are they bashing Martin Luther King in this piece?
[49:01.400 --> 49:07.120]  Because at the end, Mike Adams says America doesn't want kings anymore. And we're talking
[49:07.120 --> 49:09.800]  about King George III and we don't want King Obama.
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.040]  And then people thought it was code against Martin Luther King. I mean, whoa, New World
[49:14.040 --> 49:20.680]  Order is coming down on people at a million miles an hour and people are looking for codes.
[49:20.680 --> 49:23.360]  But I'm gonna shut up though, cuz I wanna break here in a minute and a half. Let's start
[49:23.360 --> 49:25.280]  with this clip. Here it is.
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.280]  Are you for Hitler or against Hitler? Whatever they say is the opposite. They never tell
[49:30.280 --> 49:34.880]  the truth. Tonight as millions of Americans worry about the government taking away their
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.680]  guns, this man, Alex Jones, is pushing a lot of buttons.
[49:39.680 --> 49:45.120]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. We
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.160]  will not relinquish them. Do you understand? The republic will rise again when you attempt
[49:50.160 --> 49:51.160]  to take our guns.
[49:51.160 --> 49:58.920]  When Jones went on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, to discuss gun control in the wake of the
[49:58.920 --> 50:06.760]  Sandy Hook massacre, he created a sensation. This video went massively viral.
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.080]  And I wanna say this right here. You think you're a tough guy? Have me back with a boxing
[50:11.080 --> 50:12.200]  ring in here.
[50:12.200 --> 50:14.400]  But who is Alex Jones?
[50:14.400 --> 50:17.480]  We've got ABC Nightly News slash Nightline here.
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.540]  Despite his mistrust of the so-called mainstream media, Jones agreed to let us into his world
[50:22.540 --> 50:23.540]  for a day.
[50:23.540 --> 50:28.820]  Hey, we're just soldiers looking across each other on the picket line here.
[50:28.820 --> 50:33.320]  America has been captured. America is being robbed. We are now being looted like a third
[50:33.320 --> 50:37.520]  world nation. Well, I'm not gonna sit down and shut up.
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.920]  Jones is arguably the nation's premier purveyor of what could be called paranoia porn.
[50:42.920 --> 50:47.920]  All right, applause. Yeah, we were paranoid porn pushers when we said they were gonna
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.800]  come for your guns. We were paranoid porn pushers when we said that they would raise
[50:52.800 --> 50:55.040]  taxes on poor people, which they've now done.
[50:55.040 --> 50:58.160]  We were paranoid porn pushers when we said foreign countries would take their gold out
[50:58.160 --> 51:00.740]  of the US. It's all happening, all happening.
[51:00.740 --> 51:04.480]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[51:04.480 --> 51:09.440]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[51:09.440 --> 51:14.920]  Here's why. Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,
[51:14.920 --> 51:20.360]  solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when
[51:20.360 --> 51:23.480]  the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[51:23.480 --> 51:28.840]  Now here's the best part. Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't
[51:28.840 --> 51:34.560]  sell as new. We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily
[51:34.560 --> 51:39.120]  at the end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like
[51:39.120 --> 51:45.000]  new. Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[51:45.000 --> 51:51.280]  Don't wait, they go fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

[54:59.940 --> 55:05.200]  their support out there. We could not do it without you and also supporting our sponsors.
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.560]  We have some new skateboards that we got contacted. I shouldn't even talk about this yet, but
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.600]  the point is they're up there on the site. So I need to discuss that probably at another
[55:16.600 --> 55:22.640]  point. Great way to wake people up is to have skateboards with infowars.com and the Alien
[55:22.640 --> 55:24.920]  Workshop artwork on it.
[55:24.920 --> 55:28.760]  Okay, let's get back to the night line and I gotta get into Benghazi after this guest
[55:28.760 --> 55:32.560]  comes on. And we got the head of the Young Turks coming on the broadcast here today and
[55:32.560 --> 55:39.000]  a lot of other important economic news. But first, let's go ahead and go back to the night
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.600]  line piece. Here it is.
[55:41.600 --> 55:46.480]  The truth strikes back. I'm live in 30 seconds. All right. Out of his studios near Austin,
[55:46.480 --> 55:51.520]  Texas, his radio show and webcast reach an estimated 1 million people a day.
[55:51.520 --> 55:54.320]  This federal intrusion is out of control.
[55:54.320 --> 56:00.040]  And on YouTube and elsewhere, Jones estimates 200 million people have seen his various documentaries.
[56:00.040 --> 56:01.040]  No, that's one YouTube channel.
[56:01.040 --> 56:05.880]  You're taking our destiny back. You're not our gods or our masters.
[56:05.880 --> 56:11.320]  With titles like The Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement
[56:11.320 --> 56:13.200]  and The Obama Deception.
[56:13.200 --> 56:15.520]  Do you actually believe everything you say?
[56:15.520 --> 56:18.040]  I believe all of it, absolutely. What I'm telling is the truth.
[56:18.040 --> 56:21.480]  None of it is, you know, a shtick, a show at all?
[56:21.480 --> 56:23.040]  No, it's all true.
[56:23.040 --> 56:25.080]  You think Obama is a criminal?
[56:25.080 --> 56:27.960]  Barack Obama is definitely an unconstitutional criminal.
[56:27.960 --> 56:33.600]  Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his
[56:33.600 --> 56:34.600]  reporting.
[56:34.600 --> 56:36.040]  FEMA is running concentration camps?
[56:36.040 --> 56:37.040]  Shutting them up.
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.560]  They have designated sports stadiums. They have designated fields for the American people.
[56:41.560 --> 56:43.560]  The manuals are public. I gave them to him.
[56:43.560 --> 56:45.200]  The government's poisoning the water?
[56:45.200 --> 56:48.960]  Absolutely. I have all these other government documents where the government...
[56:48.960 --> 56:49.960]  Hit pause.
[56:49.960 --> 56:53.760]  And again, I sat there and showed them the book, showed them the clothes, showed them
[56:53.760 --> 56:56.400]  the plans, and they didn't want to look at it.
[56:56.400 --> 56:59.040]  So they cut all that out when I'm giving proof.
[56:59.040 --> 57:00.040]  Just this guy's crazy.
[57:00.040 --> 57:02.480]  Next, they're going to say they injected black people with syphilis.
[57:02.480 --> 57:03.480]  Oh, they did that.
[57:03.480 --> 57:06.680]  Next, they're going to say that they and a bunch of kids just got paralyzed again from
[57:06.680 --> 57:08.760]  the Bill Gates meningitis shots.
[57:08.760 --> 57:10.160]  Oh, never mind.
[57:10.160 --> 57:13.680]  Oh, next they'll say they radiated the troops and killed a bunch of them.
[57:13.680 --> 57:14.680]  Oh, they did that.
[57:14.680 --> 57:17.760]  Next, they'll say they sterilized a half million women without their consent.
[57:17.760 --> 57:18.760]  Oh, they did that.
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.400]  Next, they're going to say that the troops were exposed to sarin gas and it got covered
[57:22.400 --> 57:24.840]  up in the Gulf War, and tens of thousands died.
[57:24.840 --> 57:25.840]  Oh, that happened.
[57:25.840 --> 57:28.200]  Let's go back to it.
[57:28.200 --> 57:29.200]  Here it is.
[57:29.200 --> 57:33.200]  Government think tanks propose poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make it
[57:33.200 --> 57:34.600]  more easily manageable.
[57:34.600 --> 57:36.560]  9-11 was an inside job?
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.800]  Yes, 9-11 was an inside job.
[57:38.800 --> 57:42.920]  It was a staged event to launch the Iraq war and to set up a domestic police state here
[57:42.920 --> 57:43.920]  in the United States.
[57:43.920 --> 57:47.880]  All I'm calling for is a real investigation, and the people of Oklahoma City have been
[57:47.880 --> 57:49.360]  calling for an investigation.
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.640]  Jones, who's 38, got his start with a local cable access show in the 1990s.
[57:54.640 --> 57:59.080]  He now has a huge fan base, which at various times has included celebrities like Willie
[57:59.080 --> 58:01.600]  Nelson, Jesse Ventura, Charlie Sheen.
[58:01.600 --> 58:03.320]  We want our country back, Mr. President.
[58:03.320 --> 58:09.920]  I'm calling on each and every American citizen to wake up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[58:09.920 --> 58:13.480]  And reality stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag.
[58:13.480 --> 58:15.480]  Spencer Pratt, good to have you on with us today.
[58:15.480 --> 58:16.480]  Thank you so much.
[58:16.480 --> 58:19.040]  I'm so honored to be on with you.
[58:19.040 --> 58:21.040]  You are a true legend, a true man.
[58:21.040 --> 58:22.040]  All right.
[58:22.040 --> 58:23.040]  That's enough.
[58:23.040 --> 58:24.040]  The whole video's online.
[58:24.040 --> 58:30.200]  It's called The Return of Alex Jones, but I mean, I didn't have time to get to it where
[58:30.200 --> 58:31.200]  I'm throwing the football.
[58:31.200 --> 58:32.880]  We'll have to play it later.
[58:32.880 --> 58:35.640]  It's like, this is secret footage of him throwing a football.
[58:35.640 --> 58:38.720]  I mean, it's just unbelievable hit piece.
[58:38.720 --> 58:51.080]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.080 --> 58:55.800]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[58:55.800 --> 59:00.560]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[59:00.560 --> 59:04.280]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[59:04.280 --> 59:06.000]  Check out Simply Safe.
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.440]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[59:47.640 --> 59:53.640]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[59:53.640 --> 59:55.860]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:55.860 --> 01:00:05.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.200]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.360]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:26.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.800]  Earlier in the last hour, I said our guest has saved 35,000.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.800]  That was an old number.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.800]  It's 45,000 Chinese girls.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.480]  They estimate there's something like 20-something million more men in China.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.640]  Last time I saw, it may even be higher than there are women, because they're killing the
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.640]  young women.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.840]  Supposed to be about 51% women.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.120]  Women live a little bit longer, so that goes into the actuary, but also, there's slightly
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  more.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:56.080]  If you do international studies, baby girls born than baby boys.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.080]  Kind of something God designed in there, so there's more women out there.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.520]  So we can have a leg up as a mammalian species, but that's a side issue.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.520]  Again, Alex Jones here.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.560]  Thanks for joining us, Dr. James Garrow, PhD.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.480]  Well-known, I've heard of him many times, Canadian teacher and businessman who founded
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:18.840]  a big institute in China back in the 60s, discovered how they were killing the children
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.360]  with the one-child policy, which is now on record.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.920]  In fact, his work helped expose that.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.280]  He's coming up in the next segment, because he was told by a retired high-level military
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.820]  officer that the litmus test is, will you fire on US citizens?
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:36.480]  And I just thought, I probably should have done more research, not more research, more.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.080]  That's not the work, cuz I've done the research.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.400]  I should have done more polling data and sources to show you here, because I can show you all
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.840]  the army manuals where they're training for gun confiscation.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.280]  I can show you all of that where they're training to shoot Americans.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.800]  I mean, that's on the news now.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.200]  So you understand, it's not just him talking to this source we're gonna try to find out
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.600]  about.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.240]  It's that it's already hiding in plain view.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.600]  And the 1.6 billion bullets and the end deposit commentatas and the troops on the streets
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.920]  and all the rest of it, that's coming up in the next segment.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.520]  He'll be with us for about 35, 40 minutes.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.640]  And then I will get into Benghazi, cuz that's very important.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.080]  And I wanna break down what's really behind that.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.360]  I mentioned some of it last hour, but it's key that's coming up.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.000]  And then I'm seeing articles like this every two or three days, well, actually every day,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  really.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.160]  Cuz every couple days I'll see two or three at one time, so I guess it's about every day.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.000]  There's probably seven of these stories a week I'd have to guesstimate.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.600]  Elementary school girl threatened with arrest over paper gun.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.040]  And you hear about people saying, career day, right about your dad or mom.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.120]  Well, my dad's in the Marines, here's a picture of him with his M-16.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.400]  Boom, you're arrested, take it in for psychiatric questioning as a 10-year-old.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:52.720]  Doesn't matter, you're the star quarterback or whatever, I've never been in trouble.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.040]  It's just crazy, or you bring a Dixie plastic knife to spread butter, your mother drops
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040]  in the lunchbox.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.960]  My mother did that, boom, you're arrested.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.160]  But government stomps around in Darth Vader outfits all day.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.940]  Elementary school girl threatened with arrest over paper gun hysteria and aftermath of Sandy
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.800]  Hook reaches new heights.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.560]  That's an Infowars.com article out of Philadelphia Elementary.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.640]  Now, of course, in Philadelphia, came out five years ago, they've got laptops they give
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.200]  you, watching you at home.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.560]  And they're the ones that announced that, they're very proud of it.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.000]  We play the clubs for the teachers doing interviews, that's how it broke going, yeah, we watch
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.920]  you when you're at home, what you're doing, look out.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.280]  Like there's Santa Claus or Demon Claus or something.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.680]  This is the total demonization of a boy's playing with an orange and green Nerf gun
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.560]  in his front yard with kids, SWAT team is called.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.200]  The anti-gunners are so anti-gun, they say they don't believe boys should be able to
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.840]  play with guns.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.160]  You hear about kids getting in trouble for making bang bang, using their fingers as a
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]  gun.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.960]  But the so-called leftists who are really authoritarians, they want checkpoints, they
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.640]  want a billion six bullets, they want armored vehicles, they want TSA hands on the pants.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:09.200]  They wanna bomb Benghazi and bomb Syria, they wanna do all this, they love force.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:15.680]  Some Belgrade, go after the Serbs, but that cuz it's loving when they do it, they love
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.680]  force.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.920]  I mean, you know these people when they see an orange gun and kids running around the
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.640]  front yard, you see everywhere.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.720]  You know that they know that's not a real gun when they see a six year old doing it
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.720]  and they call the police.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:35.880]  It's like neighbors in Oklahoma saw the upstanding middle class families, three year old pee
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.120]  up against a tree in the front yard.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.000]  They came and they gave them a ticket and threatened them with arrest and stuff, and
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.560]  they fired that cop and they should have.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.280]  I mean everybody knows that three year olds pee in the yard, but again it's this idea
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.400]  of get us all in the system, get us in trouble.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.720]  I mean, fucks, I'll be honest with you, I pee in my backyard, I mean who doesn't?
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:00.880]  Of course this was in the front yard, I don't know.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.720]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.320]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.160]  by a disastrous economy.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.880]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.680]  At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.600]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.140]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.960]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960]  and niece.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.760]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.000]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:37.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are into the second hour of worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:44.120]  The main host of the Young Turks, Sink, is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.800]  Coming up in about 30, 40 minutes.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.360]  I'm going to break down the latest on what really happened in Benghazi and the aftermath
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.320]  of Hillary Clinton's ridiculous testimony and Rand Paul saying that if he was Obama,
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.000]  she should have been relieved of her office, of her position.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.120]  I mean, they're all in on it.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.360]  They ordered a stand down in Benghazi to cover up what was really happening there.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.600]  Eight hours.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.680]  Their own Al-Qaeda security they hired to run Benghazi are the ones that killed them.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.800]  And none of the senators will bring that up.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.600]  I mean, it's hiding in plain view, but their whole narrative falls apart.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.520]  And they can't take our rights anymore if they point out that elements of the government,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.620]  criminal elements, are running Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.620]  Not the whole government.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.800]  See, they go, you're a 9-11 truther.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.640]  You're not saying there's not any Muslim extremists.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.080]  That's not what I'm saying.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.180]  I'm saying our government uses them to take down countries and uses them to then menace
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.640]  America and take our liberties.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.000]  That's coming up.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.360]  Now Dr. James Garrow, PhD, is a Canadian teacher and businessman.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:51.960]  And in 1968, he founded the Bethune Institute, legendary language school, the People's Republic
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.200]  of China, named after the Canadian surgeon, Dr. Norman Bethune.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.240]  I think I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.920]  One day in 2000, Dr. Jim Garrow, executive director of the institute's popular Pink Pagoda
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.960]  schools in China, found his assistant weeping.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.280]  The woman told him how her sister's husband was insisting that the couple's newborn daughter
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.720]  be smothered to make way for a son under China's one-child policy.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.600]  And this has now all been confirmed.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.200]  Years ago, they would deny it.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.800]  Garrow's promised to help and was able to place the infant with an adoptive couple.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.040]  That's why you see so many Chinese girls in America now, mainly adopted by evil white
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.340]  people, of course, because all whites are evil, according to people like, I've got a
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:44.280]  bizarre Daily Beast article here, we're gonna get to later, where they, well, just wait
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280]  till I cover it.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:52.960]  It's absolutely, absolutely astounding when you see it, admitting that they're getting
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.800]  rid of America and getting rid of our sovereignty.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.800]  It's incredible.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.920]  I've got to cover that today.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:04.800]  But Dr. James Garrow joins us because if you're up at Infowars.com, you can see this article,
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.840]  also punch it up for people watching on television.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:14.040]  Nobel Peace Prize nominee Obama asked military leaders if they will fire on US citizens.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.600]  Shock claim purported to come from one of America's foremost military leaders.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.800]  Well, we've already got General Boykin, former head of Special Forces, saying our government,
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.120]  he believes, was giving weapons to Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.720]  And that's what Benghazi is, is a cover-up.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.020]  He believes, it's admitted.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.400]  That's what's so incredible here.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400]  We don't know if it's Boykin.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400]  I'm gonna try to find out here.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.480]  The point is, if you go to our article, and there was other articles that actually broke
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.760]  it in the Examiner and a couple others the day before.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.200]  And I'm giving them credit.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:48.520]  Our articles, they'll back it up with the Army training manuals from 2010 FM 3-39.40
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520]  internment resettlement.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.400]  It also has gun confiscation, how to take over cities.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.400]  You can click on that and read that.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.780]  The clergy response teams, the backup that, hey, this guy's credible.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.780]  That's why we got him on.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.860]  And I believe he's telling the truth.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:08.000]  But I've talked to Colonel Roberts, whose nephew graduated from West Point, was in these
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.080]  Army meetings telling him, 10 years ago, we're training to confiscate guns.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.120]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.240]  I mean, there's hundreds of data points.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.800]  The Army National Guard trained in Iowa and Arcadia to confiscate guns.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.840]  That was in the news.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]  You know about this.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.940]  You saw Katrina.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:29.980]  But the litmus test is, will you fire on US citizens?
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.320]  And they tried it in Katrina.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.840]  They're doing the drills everywhere.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.360]  But now they've bought the 1.6 billion bullets.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.660]  Now they're hiring people out of the military to move them into Homeland Security as a militarized
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.840]  domestic force.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.440]  New York Times, scouts trained to fight terrorists and more three and a half years ago.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.520]  Those 14-year-old explorer scouts are now 17 and a half, training to, quote, take on
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.280]  disgruntled vets that wouldn't turn their guns in.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.240]  First paragraph of the New York Times, with dozens of color photos showing the simulated
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.200]  killing with paintball guns of veterans in America.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.320]  I've talked to ROTC people on air and confirmed, they don't train to fight Al-Qaeda, they train
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.960]  to fight US militias.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.920]  They've got four TV shows coming out this year, demonizing American gun owners and how
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.600]  we're gonna be the new terror force.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.840]  Homeland Security is now converting over to the American people.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.600]  Now I'm gonna shut up and go to our guest.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.080]  I wanted to back that up for people.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.960]  So you can go to our article, Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Obama asked military leaders,
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.520]  they will fire on US citizens.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.240]  Now we're gonna find out from the man himself who talked to this individual, Dr. James Garrow,
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240]  PhD.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.040]  Number one, I would say this military officer, he says the foremost out there, needs to go
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.740]  public or they may die in a kayak accident like the former CIA director who exposed Waco
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.640]  and leaked the Fleer footage because he was upset about it.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.520]  A, he better go or she better go public with this right now.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:58.160]  And I think it's better for you to do that because the system knows when a general or
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.680]  even a Pat Tillman, someone well known comes out, that's the danger.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.940]  If I'm up here showing army manuals, they know the average person isn't gonna go look
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.720]  those up and find that I'm telling the truth.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.940]  So I'm gonna go to you, Dr. James Garrow, PhD.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:15.720]  Tell us how the story unfolds, what you were told, then I wanna get into saving Chinese
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.820]  girls before they get smothered or used for medical experiments.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:19.820]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:20.820]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:21.820]  I hope you can hear me fine.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.820]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.360]  We got your video Skype and got you on phone.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.660]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, for those that don't know, and then get into what this
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.040]  military officer told you, this individual.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.560]  Well, okay.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.680]  And first of all, I'm an educator, but a businessman.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.800]  I operate schools in China.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:46.220]  And in the past, I've been a college president and the teacher's college principal here in
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.220]  Canada.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:51.800]  My background is education, but I also am involved in business, of course, in the country
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.800]  of China.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.760]  I probably have the largest network of schools, foreign language schools, in China.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.560]  And the elites send their kids to our schools.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.760]  So we know a lot about what's going on directly from the Chinese elite, the leaders.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.520]  Hu Jintao's niece was in one of my schools, and the current leader, Xi Lingping, his daughter
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:16.480]  was in one of my schools, and of course, is now in Harvard, but that's beside the point.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.200]  So that gives you a little bit of background on me.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:28.040]  And I should have added, you've gotten 45,000 plus, and we actually, David Knight has adopted
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.720]  children from China who would have been disposed of girls.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.200]  So he vouches for you as well, and I mean, I know who you are, but he says you're certainly
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.200]  the bona fide.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.000]  So thank you for that information, saving 45,000 girls at the UN and the eugenicists
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.240]  say are worth nothing, because they're such big feminists.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:51.360]  Now let's get into this officer, what they told you, and elaborate on this information.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.360]  Shall do.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:59.440]  I got a call the day before yesterday in the morning from this officer, a former officer,
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.760]  he's retired, but he was quite upset that one of the people he'd encouraged to join
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:10.360]  the military was being squeezed out, that he was forced to resign his commission.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.840]  And it was because a question was asked of him.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.280]  Now I've called it a litmus test, but basically what it is, he was asked if in a scenario,
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:25.760]  if in a situation where the military was called upon to go and confront people who were armed,
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.640]  American citizens who would not relinquish their arms, in spite of the second amendment
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:36.400]  right to hold arms, would you fire on American citizens?
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:42.080]  This gentleman related to me that the officer was totally flummoxed that he would be asked
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:48.880]  this question, and he said his answer was no, I would not fire on American citizens.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.600]  And he was forced to resign his commission immediately.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.640]  Amazing.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:17:00.520]  Tell us more about, I mean, to quote you here from the article, you basically described
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:07.880]  him as one of America's most foremost military heroes.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.600]  Can you give us an idea about this person?
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.200]  Is this person going to go public?
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.440]  Can you tell us what else he relayed to you?
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:20.640]  Well, we had an hour long conversation, so it ran the gamut from talking about the transparency
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:26.640]  or lack of, the manipulation of the mindset of the public as a result of a media that
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:35.440]  no longer actually reports news, but now spouts the Obamaism, there was that part of the conversation.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:40.540]  His concern though was that the military was going to be put in an awful position where
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:46.240]  they had to look at the oath they had taken, look at the officers who were also required
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.300]  to give an oath to obey the orders given by those above them, including the commander
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.880]  in chief, which would make it Obama.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:18:00.300]  And if those orders were in fact to kill American civilians because they would not give up something
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:05.960]  they had a constitutional right to in the second amendment, namely their guns, he was
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:13.320]  afraid that so many would be leaving the military that it would leave a vacuum actually in fact
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:20.920]  for people who would really be swearing allegiance to a new king, a new dictator, Obama.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.560]  And that was his concern.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.120]  This man is a legend, yes, you would know his name, every American would know his name,
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.400]  and no, he will not be coming public, he'll not be bringing it out in public.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.280]  He thought that the best thing he could do is put it out in a different way.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.400]  I was honored that he called me.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.480]  So it's not somebody like Boykin?
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:49.600]  I can't give you the name, he's asked me not to, so in honoring that request, I won't
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600]  answer that.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.920]  I know several generals and he'd be at the top of the list, and by knowing them, I know
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.920]  people that have worked with them, made films with some of these generals, and there's only
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.840]  a list of four or five that I know that would probably start talking about something like
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.840]  this.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.160]  I know they're training for it, I have the video, I have the training manuals, it's really
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160]  not a secret.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.720]  And I've had military call in who said, we've been asked, are we gonna fire on citizens,
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.680]  and then we're shipped overseas if we won't, or kicked out.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:19.440]  And they're forming, and then basically sheep dipping, making them quasi-CIA, Homeland Security,
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.720]  domestic, kind of NKVD units.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:28.320]  And I got news for the establishment, you'll be able to kill Alex Jones, take out Ron Paul
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.680]  in the first wave.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:34.720]  But once you kill the Canaries, I would not wanna be anybody in a government uniform at
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.720]  that point.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.560]  And that's part of the plan too, a civil war.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.560]  I wanna talk about your hour long conversation with this person, and where the military's
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.640]  trying to kill us and take our guns.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.600]  I mean, obviously, Obama's controllers, the foreign globalist, they know this is designed
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.040]  to destroy the military and police, which is what you said.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.560]  It gets rid of them, because you're still gonna have bad officers commanding them, and
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.000]  then brings in the new forces.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.720]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.680]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.680]  Here's why.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.760]  Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:19.400]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400]  from the sun.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.840]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.460]  Now here's the best part.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:30.140]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:35.320]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320]  each year.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.040]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:45.240]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.800]  Don't wait, they go fast.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.680]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:21:00.960]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.560]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.

[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.100]  It's like a salon in a bottle.
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:34.320]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.540]  counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.540]  to service debt.
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:43.060]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:46.440]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.440]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.680]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.900]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.320]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.680]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.680]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:07.680]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa where a nicely furnished cabin
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.800]  with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.200]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:24.400]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game, but it's not Africa, it's Argentina.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:30.680]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:38.360]  stag deer in South America, all gold medal quality, all the action you can handle.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:43.720]  Wide rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.220]  transportation included, and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:24:05.960]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com, the big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:12.400]  Pagodagirls.com is the site, the foundation and organization that saved over 45,000 Chinese
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.680]  girls that would have been smothered, ground, or medical experiments.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:20.480]  Now they just come and pick them up, the state picks them up, and they just disappear off
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:25.640]  into a labyrinth of hell, just like the Falun Gong being blood-typed and harvested for the
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.640]  elites for their organs.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.040]  We're going to get into that in the next segment with our guest, Hunter James Garrow, PhD,
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.400]  very highly respected individual.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.120]  My guess, if I have to say who it is, is that it'd be somebody like General, Lieutenant
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.400]  General William Boykin, who's also exposing right now that our government's giving weapons
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.400]  to Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:48.000]  And that's in the news today, that's coming up after our guest leaves us, and by the way,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.120]  that's in the film, Behold a Pale Horse, America's Last Chance, starring country music legend
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.600]  Charlie Daniels, and Boykin is in that film.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.560]  That's why I'm guessing it'd be somebody like Boykin, because you can disagree with some
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:05.380]  of his views in the past, but he is overall a patriot who's anti-New World order and pro-sovereignty
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:07.640]  and that's about the only kind of guy I'd see exposing that.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:13.520]  Somebody like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was in government, exposes this type of stuff.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:19.080]  Another Roberts, Lieutenant Colonel Roberts out of Oklahoma, he's exposed things like
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.440]  this, but it's all out there.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.960]  We're going to get into China coming up in the next segment, but what else, Dr. Garrow,
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:33.560]  can you relay to us in this hour-long conversation, and why did this senior household name for
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:39.640]  anybody that knows military, one of America's foremost military heroes, to quote you, why
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:45.720]  would they come to you, I mean, I know he knows you, and tell you this information,
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:51.200]  and then say, get it out there, but I can't say, and then relay other things that he told
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.200]  you?
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:58.560]  Well, I would suggest that he's talking in fear, that he knows that the Obama administration
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.720]  has a circle of death around them in terms of, I use that term because that has been
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:11.280]  said to me, because there are people who have met with an unfortunate fate, who have dared
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:18.880]  to cross Obama, but this gentleman came to me, I've known him for about 17 years, and
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.440]  he came to me as a result of the fact that he had read the book that I had just written
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:32.440]  about my work, Saving Baby Girls in China, and he had called me about three months ago
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.960]  saying, hey, I bought a copy of your book, it's wonderful, da-da-da-da, and that made
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:42.400]  the connection, so the other day when he called me, he was just saying, Jim, look, I know
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.600]  you're connected with all sorts of people, you're on the net, you know how to do all
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.400]  these things, would you put this out for me?
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.360]  And I said that it would be an honour for me to do that.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.760]  Well obviously, he's risking his life putting this out, because the info's out there, and
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.520]  a lot of these older generals, and it came to you because he doesn't understand the internet
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.480]  completely, and how it works, they still, I mean obviously he knows the NSA's gonna
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:14.340]  track this back, they're gonna know the relationship, Obama knows, and I mean, I guess he thinks
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:18.460]  that if he just puts it out there in intermediary, they won't go after him, the danger is now
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.120]  not going public full bore, that's when they come after you.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:30.880]  But if they kill this foremost military hero, living hero, then everybody will know.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.420]  So I mean, in a way, I guess it's good that he did talk to you, but what else did he say
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:38.480]  about this other person he got to join the military years ago, now being asked if they'd
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.680]  fire on US citizens, I mean, what else did he tell you about the plan to come after us?
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.360]  Well that's basically it, he was reflecting back to me what was being said to him, about
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.080]  this poor fella who he'd encouraged to get involved in the military, and the man who'd
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.120]  gone up the ranks, suddenly this litmus test was being put in front of him, and it was
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.960]  either, you know, you're gonna agree or you're not, you're gonna get squeezed out.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:11.600]  So his concern was that good, loyal Americans who had decided to give their lives to the
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.400]  country in the service of the country, were being put in such an awful position.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.360]  I mean, this is the kind of thing that you would expect to have, a test of loyalty as
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:27.440]  it were, for people who were involved in Mao's regime, or down in Chavez's regime, or somewhere
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:31.360]  else, like the Nazis, this is the kind of thing they would have done, this isn't what
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.760]  happens in a democracy, this isn't what happens with people in the services, serving the nation,
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.760]  putting their lives on the line, this is just not what happens.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:45.880]  So the shock here is the knowledge that this isn't just one person it's happening to, this
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:51.040]  person came forward, this person is somebody of integrity, but my goodness, it's not just
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:56.920]  this one gentleman, it's others, and women who were put in this position of, and are
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.880]  now being asked the question, would you in fact do this?
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.880]  And that was the shock for this well-known American hero.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:09.720]  We're gonna go to break, come back in a long segment and get into what's happening in China,
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.720]  and the authoritarianism over there, and what you've dealt with, with the killing of these
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.740]  little girls that you've been saving.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.240]  But the countless millions you haven't been able to save, unfortunately.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:24.120]  But I'm gonna briefly, when we come back, break down for people, and then get your take
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.880]  on this.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:29.840]  That the military, and I've noticed even senior brass, they're experts in their area, but
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.040]  not in full spectrum.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:35.760]  I know what the globalists are planning, cuz I watch their propaganda, and they prepare
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.960]  the ground first before they do it.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.800]  They have billed Obama as Lincoln.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.760]  And now they're, and I said this four years ago, now they're saying that he's gonna have
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:50.240]  a civil war and be our god, be our king, that they've got this set up.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:53.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:30:01.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.600]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.200]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.040]  by a disastrous economy?
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.760]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.920]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:21.480]  storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:26.020]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:30.840]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:31.840]  and niece.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.640]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.880]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:11.080]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:20.240]  I'm going to get into what we're facing here in just a moment.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.320]  And I tell you, I know about some of the few generals that have actually been anti New
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.960]  World Order to some extent.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.520]  I know about a few of the generals that have met with people that I know who've been woken
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.800]  up now, mainly retired generals.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:36.880]  I know about generals and admirals that have been shot and killed in the chest and in the
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.160]  head multiple times and it's ruled suicides the last few years.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:46.040]  All the generals you've seen having to resign, having to step down or resign their commissions,
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.800]  admirals, heads of CENTCOM.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:51.380]  The truth is our military keeps saying no, no, no, no, no.
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:56.840]  Even handpicked guys from West Point in the military 30 years who've got whole careers
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.280]  and everything ahead of them the last few years.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.280]  They are resigning.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.800]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:08.440]  Briefly, we are a listener supported radio, filmmaking, news organization and when you
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.520]  buy books and videos and materials at Infowarsstore.com, you get the very lowest prices on things like

[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.500]  Wars are not cheap.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.620]  Wars take money and this is an infowar.
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:30.040]  We know the truth will set us free and that all the evil men in tires need to flourish
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.120]  is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:37.860]  So again, we have the new t-shirt, come and take it.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:43.080]  And inside the AK-47 it says, the right to keep mere arms shall not be infringed.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:49.620]  And we also have behold a pale horse that has General Boykin in it, a patriot exposing
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:54.120]  agenda 21 and the entire New World Order system.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:59.720]  So be sure and get all of that at Infowarsstore.com and spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:04.360]  I'm up here risking my life to get the word out because I realize how evil the globalists
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.360]  are.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.800]  I realize there's no future if we don't beat them.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:12.340]  They plan and now shifting gears back to our guest, Dr. Jim Garrow, the big plan is this
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.720]  and I've studied history.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.060]  I've studied the Rand Corporation's writings.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:21.100]  I've studied the writings of the leftist finance by the big banks that want to collectivist
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.900]  system for the grassroots where the globalists are exempt from all the laws offshore.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:30.920]  So they can then take our tax money as corporate welfare offshore, invest our pension funds
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.840]  in their fraudulent derivative scams to hold the entire financial system hostage.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.920]  That's it in a nutshell.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:44.720]  It's a corporate fashions system, a crony anti-free market capitalist monopoly system
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:51.480]  sitting on top of a lower tier socialism communism, social engineering program.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.200]  And I started seeing this five years ago and I'm on record in Obama deception four years
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.200]  ago.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.200]  I'm on record in Fall of the Republic three and a half years ago, two films about Obama
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.040]  saying they're building him up as a messianic Christ.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.540]  They keep saying he's Lincoln.
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:06.540]  He's Lincoln.
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:07.540]  He's somebody like Lincoln.
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:08.540]  You'll see.
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.760]  And I said, they're doing that to later if they decide to bring in martial law, say he's
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.720]  Lincoln who will crush the states.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.560]  Then he creates the 10 region governors to say, I don't need 50 states.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.040]  I've got 10 appointed governors.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.840]  He creates the rural council over communities all over the country and I get our guest take
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.560]  on this.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.360]  And says Homeland Security and the Pentagon is over that and then we get the training
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.360]  manuals for it.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.360]  It's gun confiscation, okay?
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:37.460]  So this is totally, absolutely creepy.
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:41.420]  And I've done reports on this, we're gonna do another this week cuz it's Paramount.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:45.400]  They're saying he's Lincoln, let the states, and I even have an article here today.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.000]  Let the states not turn their guns in.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.280]  Let the legislature say no.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.840]  He's Lincoln and will crush a new civil war.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.200]  Well, we're not gonna start a war.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.560]  They're gonna go out and try to take the guns, provocateur stuff, a new Waco if they have
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:36:59.560]  to.
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.980]  And they're going to try to elicit a 1776.
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:05.520]  So that's why I got it out in the open on Piers Morgan.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.720]  And said it will trigger a new 1776.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:14.360]  Not to cause one, but to point out to everybody out there in TV land, hey, this isn't gonna
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.360]  be fun.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.560]  Now, I'm gonna shut up and go to our guest.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:21.240]  As we went to break and I said that, he was nodding his head going, absolutely, that's
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240]  what he said.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.040]  So what did the general, cuz we know who you're talking about, I know who goes in these Christian
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.040]  circles.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.040]  I went and did some searching.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.840]  I think I know who the foremost military hero is.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.880]  But again, I think he's made a mistake only going through you as 17 year friend.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.640]  The system, if I can figure this out in about five minutes, the system knows without even
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.840]  using phone tracking systems.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.620]  So tell the general, he's not stupid that he needs to go completely public.
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:53.560]  But going back to you here, sir, what is your take on what I just said of the master plan?
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:59.480]  They plan to start a war using guns to then label all conservatives and libertarians the
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.960]  enemy, which is in all the Homeland Security training manuals that we got from state police
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.960]  and federal marshals.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  Go ahead.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.760]  You know, Alex, the only time I've ever seen you, and I'm not a watcher of programs like
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:11.760]  yours.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.160]  But the only time I've seen you was when I went and did a little bit of research and
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:20.000]  I ran across this thing where you took on this British guy, Piers Morgan.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.500]  You just mentioned him.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.560]  And I thought, you know, you just fried the guy.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.560]  You just fried him.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:29.400]  But you put it out there with such intensity that thought, you know, maybe I'm going to
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400]  get fried today.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.400]  I don't know.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:32.400]  But you know what?
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.400]  You're hot, man.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.400]  You're on the money.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.120]  When you talk about them setting it up to take away the guns and they're looking for
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.120]  the crisis.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.120]  Come on.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:45.240]  That's what Valerie Jarrett has been pushing Obama to create a crisis.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:50.080]  And your military friends, they all are aware of what's going on.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:56.160]  The nightmare for them, the nightmare scenario is having to turn their guns on American civilians
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.200]  because the new emperor, or at least the guy who thinks he's the new potentate, thinks
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:07.140]  that he can just go out there, crush the Second Amendment, crush the Constitution, and then
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.520]  crush anyone who gets in his way.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.720]  What's been the pattern, Alex, so far?
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.100]  When people get in his way, what happens to them?
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.700]  And that's because the globalists are taking over everywhere.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:19.700]  He's their puppet.
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:24.160]  I saw a video of the Speaker of the House at a dinner groveling to Michelle Obama and
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.640]  her rolling her eyes and batting him away.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:33.280]  It is pathetic how Congress, sycophantically through fear, is lining up to serve Obama.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.320]  What did your military source say?
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:38.960]  Because when I walked out after the break, you were saying, that's dead on.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.160]  That's what it is.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:43.320]  Was the military source saying they want a civil war?
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.480]  Or were you agreeing with my analysis because we have all these top Democrats saying, we
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.560]  need a big crisis to make you king?
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.040]  Alex, it was my military contact who said it is so obvious to him, so obvious to the
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:40:00.360]  man that was resigning, that what they were setting up was a takeover, a total takeover,
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.680]  by Obama, and using the military to have it happen.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.600]  And if the military will not, if they'll not give the right answer to this litmus test,
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.880]  they've got a whole army of young kids who don't know any better, ready to move in.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:18.920]  And keep in mind, who are the people who get away with in the despotic times?
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.480]  Who are the ones that they rely on in the end?
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.320]  It's the young kids who don't know any better, but who can point a gun and kill people.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.320]  Wait a minute.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.320]  So your military source knows about the FEMA Corps.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.120]  Now, this isn't secret, but it's not well known to the public.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:39.040]  Describe what he told you about that, about the Uighan squads from about 17 down to 14.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.200]  Well, his words exactly were.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:46.640]  Here's the Hitler Youth being resurrected now under this name of Obama Corps.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.960]  That's exactly what he said.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.040]  Mike, this is devastating.
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.040]  This is devastating.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.920]  Because I've gone and looked this up before I got you on, and I know the big Christian
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.920]  circles you're in.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:00.560]  99% I know, and I've talked to you off air, and you're just like, nope, I'm not talking.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.240]  But I know who this is.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.560]  And I know other military officers, colonels and others that are saying the same thing.
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.080]  I've got family that told me years ago I was right about everything, but now won't even
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.320]  talk to me who's in the army.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.480]  I mean, this is because they've been passed over promotion just because they're related
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.480]  to me.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.000]  And I mean, this is amazing that this is going on.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.760]  I mean- Are you armed?
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  Are you armed?
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]  Do you have armament?
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760]  Yes, I do.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.760]  Do you have guns?
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760]  Yes, I do.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.760]  Well, you need them.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.160]  And you know, the vice president of my company in the US is a guy named Eric Rush, who happens
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.400]  to be a black guy who's a journalist in your country.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:38.040]  Well, you know what I did for him yesterday?
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:44.520]  I purchased him an AR-15 and a sidearm because I am so worried about the things that are
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.640]  being said right now.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.760]  He's out there putting it out through WorldNetDaily, I think's the name, putting the word out,
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:57.400]  letting people know the dangers of what, are you ready for this, what China is demanding
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:58.400]  of Obama.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.400]  No, no, no.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.080]  China, China, we broke it a month ago, the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com linked to
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.080]  it.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.080]  They're People's Daily.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.640]  I know you're in China and been there, you know it.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:10.640]  Their TV said, you will, quote, have a war against your gun owners.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:11.640]  We're ready to back you.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.040]  They're the biggest owner of the debt.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.060]  And then I've got a Daily Beast article where they said, it's good that Piers Morgan is
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.480]  leading the anti-gun deal.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.800]  We need to get Americans used to foreigners running things.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.000]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.680]  Break down what's happening in China.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.760]  What's happening in China is they know, well, first of all, do you know that the Chinese
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.520]  call Obama the monkey man?
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.720]  Do you know that?
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.460]  I've seen that in the news, yes.
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:39.160]  It has nothing to do with him being black.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:42.440]  It has everything to do with the way they treat monkeys.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.800]  Monkeys are like puppets in China.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.480]  So Obama is looked upon as a puppet of China.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.920]  That's how he's looked upon.
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:55.480]  And they know full well that when he comes hat in hand begging for more dollars, they're
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.480]  going to make more demand.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:01.160]  Were you the one who broke the news about the fact that in Idaho, they've set up this
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:06.480]  thing very much like Shenzhen, China, a special economic zone?
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.480]  Was that you, Alex?
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.360]  Yes, we're one of the ones, and now Jerome Corsi has confirmed that all over the US,
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.240]  I actually visited some of these in my first film, they're setting up these economic zones
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.960]  where the government lets the Chinese government be tax free, but then citizens aren't.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.880]  That's the model in the future.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.280]  Globalist will be tax free, but we will be under Agenda 21.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.440]  Well, you know, I've talked to Joseph Farah about that.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:33.720]  I've talked to Jerome Corsi about that very thing.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:40.400]  You know, Jerry Corsi, he endorsed my book, and my book came out through Joseph Farah.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.740]  But I'm telling you, the information that's available to some people about what's going
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:52.760]  on in China and how they're treating the American land and the American resources,
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:58.800]  they're treating it as something which they will be able to grab sometime soon.
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:05.160]  And so the fact that they now have five special economic zones throughout the United States,
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.760]  you've got to be aware of what's happening.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:13.680]  The fact that discussions have taken place with Obama and some of his officials in China
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.680]  to talk about...
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:19.600]  The NAFTA superhighway is their invasion route from the Pacific side of Mexico right into
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.320]  the US, and they're going to be brought in.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:26.040]  I've talked to top officers, let's see, in the Washington Post, agreements to bring in
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.160]  under NLE 09, troops from 15 nations to quell domestic unrest.
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.640]  That's at FEMA.gov.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.160]  And guess who was on the list of the 15 nations?
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.160]  Who?
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.000]  Wouldn't be China, would it?
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.080]  That's what I'm telling listeners.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.200]  It's all...
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.240]  And people say that'll never happen.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.040]  Once they start a civil war, it will.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.480]  Yeah, it's already happening.
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.480]  They're setting it up for civil war.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.980]  They're setting it up to take away the freedom of the American people.
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.200]  And Obama, he doesn't believe in freedom.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.360]  He doesn't believe you should ever have a gun.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.840]  What else is your military source?
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:06.720]  Because, again, if you're a new listener, folks, China officially said, quote, have
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.280]  a war against your gun owners, we will back you, in their biggest TV state run and the
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.280]  People's Daily.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.880]  I mean, they're openly saying this and saying, we own your debt, you take their guns.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.640]  I mean, and then I've got a Daily Beast article saying it's good that foreigners are telling
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640]  us what to do.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:24.520]  I'm going to dig it up here, I'm trying to find it.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.800]  No, and you're absolutely correct, Alex.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.240]  It's exactly what's going on.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:33.640]  The Chinese are demanding that Obama take control of the guns because as they move in
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:39.800]  and steal the resources of America, buy them, buy them out in satisfaction of the debt,
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:42.480]  which Obama knows full well he cannot pay.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.400]  When you know you're not going to be able to pay your credit card, why don't you run
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:50.840]  it up as far as you can, as long as they're saying yes, get as much goodies as you possibly
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.840]  can.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.840]  That's the mindset of Obama.
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:57.000]  Well, he knows full well he will never have to actually pay the debt.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.300]  All he has to do is say, hey, we've already shut down the oil industry.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:03.960]  They're not drilling, we'll give you permission to drill.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:06.720]  We've already destroyed the coal industry in America.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:10.840]  So come take the coal, you can use it, it's a better coal than you have in China.
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:14.240]  They need it, they need the resources of America.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.140]  And that's what they are demanding from Obama.
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:19.500]  And let's be clear about this.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:23.160]  China has been maneuvered to be the biggest owner of our debt by the Federal Reserve who
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:27.200]  set this up when they could have just monetized and paid the debt that way.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.280]  Instead, they had the Chinese communists come in who kill millions of their dissidents on
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:34.480]  record because they're the model of globalism.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.400]  We're told by the CFR, China is the model, not the Chinese people, the authoritarianism.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:45.560]  They use the slave wages, the Apple factories with the suicide nets, so no one can compete
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.860]  in the West to consolidate power in globalist hands.
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.760]  And then the Chinese People's Daily and their biggest TV station, we did a news article
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.000]  linked to it.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.480]  Paul Watson was aware of it because his wife is Chinese and she first alerted it.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:02.600]  Paul went and found the actual English version of it.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:05.560]  And they say, I've read this on air, listeners can go pull it up.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:11.600]  In fact, guys, the headline's something like Chinese state-run media tells Obama to take
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.600]  the guns.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.040]  Pull up the info words for me, guys, good job.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.720]  I wanna show viewers, radio listeners, pull it up.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:22.960]  And they say, quote, wage war against the gun owners, do whatever it takes, it's key.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:26.760]  We've given you money, and again, they're gonna be given the national parks, the land
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:28.520]  is collateral, that's all official.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:33.640]  The Chinese communists were being conquered and they're saying, hey, we own your people
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.180]  now, you take their guns.
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:40.400]  And now the UN treaties coming up, this is the master plan, it's so evil.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.560]  Yeah, you know, it's funny, but I was told, when I checked with my friends, I said, have
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.780]  you ever heard of this guy, Alex Jones?
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:50.240]  And one of my American friends said, well, you know, he's a bit of a conspiracy theory
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.240]  nut.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:55.180]  And, you know, now I've come on, I've listened to what you've had to say, and I'm sitting
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:58.520]  here going, wow, this guy's not a nut?
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:47:59.520]  You have the information.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:03.520]  I don't know where you're getting this, but I'm telling you, you are right on the money.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.660]  And keep in mind something, Yamamoto was right when he said, you don't wanna invade America
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.680]  because behind every blade of grass, there'll be a gun.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:16.280]  And you know, the Chinese know full well, that's exactly the situation with America
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.280]  right now.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:19.720]  Obama knows, he's got his marching orders.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:25.020]  He's been told to take your guns, he's been told to have your people crushed so that the
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:27.360]  Chinese can do what they want.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:28.360]  You're right.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:33.600]  And we did find that People's Daily, one of the articles where it says innocent blood
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:37.520]  demands gun control, and then it talks about waging war against American gun owners.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.640]  So here's the article, peers pressure, believe it or not, Morgan is a great spokesman for
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.640]  gun control.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:49.120]  And the article goes on to say, he is globalization 2.0, you know, teaching us to basically go
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.680]  under global government, and it will only survive if we submit to this.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:57.080]  I mean, this is amazing what they've done to us.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:58.360]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.000]  You've been manipulated every which way but loose.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.320]  They know full well that the, here's the other thing, the United Nations and the World Bank
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:13.000]  in collusion with Obama, suppose he turns around and says to them or to the world community,
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.080]  you know what, we cannot meet the debt.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.240]  Could you help us out here?
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:25.000]  Could you help us broker a fair solution and pay off the debt in some way possible in whatever
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  way possible?
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.040]  And the United Nations and the World Bank will be glad to say yes, we'll come in.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:33.280]  In fact, let's just do this.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.400]  Let's look at Idaho.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.400]  Look what you've got out there.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400]  You got all this open space.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.280]  Let's look at Kansas.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.720]  We need the breadbasket.
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.960]  We need to be able to grow great.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.240]  And that's why they've got to have Obama as the head of the UN Security Council violating
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:47.360]  Article 1 Section 9 Clause 8.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:52.800]  That's why they admit in this Daily Beast article by Peter Beinart, who really shows
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:55.680]  he's a globalist, they've got to get us used to this.
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.640]  They've got to get us ready to go under world government.
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:03.240]  It's so incredibly sick that they've maneuvered us to this point.
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.000]  And by the way, they found it in the People's Daily.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.360]  Punch it back up for me, guys.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:11.400]  They found where it said Obama needs to engage in a protracted war.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:12.400]  You guys just had it.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.020]  You had it right on the spot with the war part.
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:16.480]  That's what I wanted to read on air.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.480]  TV viewers saw it.
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.480]  There it is.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.480]  Action speaks louder than words.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.680]  If Obama wants to take practical measures to control guns, he has to make preparation
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:28.000]  for a protracted war and considerable political cost.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.840]  Then they go on to say the Chinese government's ready to help.
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:31.840]  What do you make of that?
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.480]  I mean, that is just in our face.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:38.720]  Yeah, well, keep in mind, yeah, it's an incremental thing.
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:40.040]  And that's what this guy is.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.040]  Obama's all about incrementalism.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.960]  What's he done to the American public?
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.960]  If you ever would you ever countenance for one minute, any man putting their hands on
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:49.960]  your wife?
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.600]  Would you ever wouldn't you detect the person who do that?
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.960]  But now you do TSA.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:58.840]  Every time you go into the airport, every time stay there, we're gonna come back, we're
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:50:59.840]  gonna come back.
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.160]  You know what's going on.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:05.160]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:09.200]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:12.600]  family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:15.300]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:19.480]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:22.020]  storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:26.560]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:31.360]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.360]  and niece.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:36.160]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:38.400]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.760]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:04.440]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:09.520]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:11.560]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:16.520]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.820]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:24.480]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:27.360]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:31.240]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:36.920]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:39.720]  and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:45.560]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus

[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:56.080]  forever.

[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:05.200]  Well, this is the end of our interview.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:10.560]  You're in about six minutes with Jim Garrow, but I want to get him back on for a full hour
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:13.000]  next week or as soon as he can.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:22.600]  He saved over 45,000 young newborn baby Chinese girls that would have been killed.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.820]  And he joins us right now.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:27.080]  Here's the Daily Beast, okay?
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:33.640]  And there are literally dozens of similar articles by Peter Beinart, how you pronounce
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:38.280]  it, and this is, of course, Newsweek's biggest publication online.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:42.800]  And they say, we got to get Americans used to globalism, you got to go read it.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.320]  And that we're preparing everybody and that America's power is in decline, globalization
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:51.320]  means that other nations will influence and judge us, and we must basically do what they
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.320]  say.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:59.320]  And they go on to say, Chinese officials are lecturing us, and that's good, that's a quote.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:04.200]  Mexican billionaires are lecturing us, that's good, you got to go read this.
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:07.960]  And then it goes on to say Al Jazeera's purchased current TV, that's good, it's good for us
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.760]  to go under foreign control.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:15.360]  And then he says somewhere, Alex Jones is readying his flamethrower, let him.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:20.160]  Because in the next round of the culture war, we will likely not just pit black and brown
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:21.160]  versus white.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:25.520]  That's why they get on the news and say, gun owning is racist, we're gonna get the whites.
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:29.740]  That's why Rangel's saying, whites are the enemy, southerners are the enemy, gun owners
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.740]  are the enemy.
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:33.280]  And you're like, that's really crazy.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:39.080]  Political correctness teaches everybody to be nice, but then again, this is all a plan.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.040]  It's secular versus religious.
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:47.720]  It will pit those Americans who can't accept the increased, let's just go to our guest.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:51.720]  It says Alex is readying his flamethrower, let him, they basically just say they're gonna
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.000]  smash us.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  I'm seeing this everywhere, and I've seen this in the Weatherman FBI trials where some
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.480]  of them admitted to being in these meetings, where they said, we're gonna kill the libertarians
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:03.480]  and conservatives.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.160]  They said, we're gonna put them in reeducation camps, we're gonna bring the Chinese in to
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.160]  do this.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.200]  I mean, this is insanity.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.280]  But they're really, it looks like going to try it with the Civil War as the cover kicked
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.320]  off by taking the guns.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.600]  I just read that where they say, Alex showed us our enemy, don't worry, we're gonna get
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.600]  him.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.760]  I mean, Piers Morgan has said he wants to shoot me.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:22.760]  What do you make of these people?
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:29.320]  Well, the founding fathers knew exactly what was going to come down the pipe if ever people
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:34.960]  lost sight of why the Constitution was built the way it was, why the Republic was framed
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:36.400]  the way it was.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:42.240]  And what you're doing, you are actually, again, I'm back to this thing of where is this nut
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.640]  case, Alex Jones, coming from?
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.640]  Well, you're not.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:47.200]  You're on the money.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:52.480]  And you are providing the protection that the Fifth Estate, that the people in the media
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.920]  should be providing the people of the United States by exposing the very things that you're
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:57.920]  talking about.
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:03.360]  There's a huge, I'm gonna say it because there's the word, there's conspiracy, there's complicity
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.160]  all over the United States.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.800]  And you know, your poor military people are sitting there, they know, they are aware,
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:14.600]  they know the manipulation, they know the expectations that they will be called upon
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.920]  to move against the American people.
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.880]  These people are heartsick.
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:25.160]  They're heartsick of the portent of having to turn their guns against their own people.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:30.080]  And so they're walking out in droves, Alex, which is part of the plan because they already
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.520]  have the collaborators lined up ready to take over.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.520]  That's right.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:35.520]  One of the first people-
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:37.840]  Well, they should say yes, they will.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:42.160]  They should say yes, they will in this situation and infiltrate the New World Order.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:47.640]  I mean, that's completely biblical, just like the spies visiting the city and I mean, that's
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.640]  gotta be done.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:52.560]  I say, just say, yeah, I'll fire on them, and then sit there and warn everybody behind
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:53.560]  the scenes.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:54.960]  And I think that's the answer here.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.980]  Well, it would be great if they were left to that, if they weren't put in positions
[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:03.480]  where they have to actually say no all over the place.
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.960]  And remember, these people are crafty.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:05.960]  Look at Obama.
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:12.160]  Has anyone ever made Obama stand up in public where he was actually questioned about everything
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:13.160]  in his past?
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.160]  No, everything's always staged.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:18.000]  I mean, he's got three different names, everything's sealed.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.680]  Yeah, what's with this?
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:26.800]  What happened to a legal system that pulls back the onion and everyone has justice applied
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:27.800]  to them equally?
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:31.200]  Well, Obama, golly, gee, what's gone on with him?
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:32.200]  Amazing.
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.920]  So we've got to have you back up again soon.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:35.920]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:36.920]  Thank you, Alex.

[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:53.880]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:59.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.040]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.040]  to the global takeover.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:12.040]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:15.720]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:20.680]  You've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:25.400]  The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages are out
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:26.400]  in the field.
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:29.480]  Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:35.000]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein, TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself

[01:59:54.040 --> 02:00:05.640]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:10.520]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:11.520]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:13.640]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:17.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:24.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:37.640]  That was such an amazing interview with Jim Garo.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:42.040]  And we've done some research on him the last 48 hours and were able to connect dots and
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.080]  I was able to talk to him off air and get his response.
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:53.400]  And I believe with about 97% certainty, actually I'm completely certain, that the individual
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:59.320]  that told him that high-level military people that he recruited and gotten in special forces,
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:04.680]  that the person that they're talking about is the man that's in the film Behold a Pale
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:10.960]  Horse, available by the way at InfoWarsStore.com if you wanna get it there and support us.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:18.200]  But we're talking about retired former head of special forces, General William Boykin.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:21.960]  Because of the Christian circles and I happen to know Boykin's been involved trying to help
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.820]  get Chinese girls out of China so they're not aborted.
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:31.520]  After birth, they kill them up a couple years, parents hide them and stuff.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:33.800]  And it kind of freaked him out out there when I went out there and said, is it Boykin?
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:37.360]  And the guy's like, I'm not gonna sit there and do this question and answer.
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:41.720]  Boy, you really are smart, how do you know?
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:46.320]  So the point is, is that, well, there's not many people that even have the courage to,
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:50.960]  and of course, it's on record that he runs in the circles of Boykin and they know each
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  other.
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:56.200]  And obviously, Boykin knows, the government knows that.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:00.400]  And I'm not saying he's not a really smart guy, but at the same time, he went to this
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:05.400]  fella because he's like, well, you know about the internet, can I work through you?
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:08.920]  We need to get a hold of the filmmaker, he's been trying to get a hold of me, I've just
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:09.920]  been too busy to talk to him.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:14.720]  I've been too busy to even call my other source, I'm just completely overwhelmed at this point.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.000]  I mean, I'm gonna be honest with everybody, but I already know their battle plan.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.200]  And I just continue to get more intel and more data on them and it's a bold move.
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:29.460]  Fortune favors the bold and the globalist are bold, that's why I'm bold.
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:33.640]  And Pat Tillman found out they were growing drugs and doing all this evil stuff in Afghanistan,
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:34.640]  he was gonna go public.
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:36.880]  So they killed him.
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.000]  And I think General Boykin, he's already gone public and behold a pale horse.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  He's already exposed.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:48.700]  Well, actually Boykin is in CNS news today saying our government is arming with Al-Qaeda
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:51.200]  and giving them weapons in Syria.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:54.520]  So that's actually in the news today.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:03:03.260]  So it's Boykin, 97%, and I guess we need to get a hold of Boykin.
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:04.400]  We know who to call to get his number.
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:06.840]  I don't know why I haven't tried to get Boykin on to begin with.
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:11.680]  And we need to just, I need to talk to him and go, look, General, it's time to just go
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:12.680]  all the way.
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:15.820]  It's time to get your missiles launched before they blow you up on the pad.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:19.280]  And I'm just telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that's what we gotta do.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:21.880]  And me, I'm in God's hands, I'm not worried about it.
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:27.640]  He said the military living legend is scared.
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:32.320]  And I guess when you're an old man admitting all that combat earlier and it's not even
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:34.300]  scared, it's sad, freaked out.
[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:36.240]  It's like, wow, it's really happening.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.320]  They're really getting the military ready to come confiscate guns, have a civil war
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:41.040]  and bring in the Chinese communist.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.720]  Let me tell you, a lot of mainline conservatives are all talk folks, they'll get out and salute
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.240]  the Reds if they came in here, I'm telling you right now.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:55.000]  I mean, they'd line up, I mean, look, all the TV shows bad mouth George Washington.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.880]  I mean, if they had a public hanging in Austin, for me, people get out there and salute while
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:01.520]  they hung my butt.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:07.520]  I guarantee it, most people are cowards and they love evil, but I got news for the New
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:08.520]  World Order.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:14.200]  There's a good 15% of people aren't gonna back down, and they're men and women.
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:20.200]  And so good luck with that big highway that just got completed, almost all of it from
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:24.640]  the southern Pacific side of Mexico right up into Texas.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:29.720]  And they've built it right up into San Antonio and right up to the extension around town.
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.520]  And we stopped it just north of here, fighting it as hard as we could.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:39.760]  That globalist taxation control grid to run the Chinese troops up, we killed it dead just
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:41.480]  north of Austin.
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:43.840]  And here we are fighting as hard as we can.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:49.640]  And most people cannot believe how serious this is, how real this is, but you're gonna
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:51.440]  find out.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:05:01.080]  We're trying to stop them, but if we don't stop them, boy, just remember you were warned.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:05.360]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.440]  Don't be one of them.
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:11.440]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:12.440]  solution.

[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:33.120]  other harmful pathogens.
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:38.000]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.140]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:45.800]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.660]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:10.120]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:12.540]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:17.080]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:18.320]  on earth.
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:23.140]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:24.980]  expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:29.160]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:31.080]  powerful shadow state.
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:35.440]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:48.840]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:50.880]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:51.880]  It's here.

[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:22.360]  That's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:38.680]  All right.
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:09:00.240]  Students, what they think of President Obama's assault weapons ban.
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:03.680]  If the feds start confiscating assault weapons, will you turn your guns in?
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:04.680]  Absolutely not.
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:05.680]  No chance.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:11.080]  I completely disagree with what President Obama said the other day in his order and
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:12.080]  all that.
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:15.320]  And I will not turn any of my guns in and there's nothing they can really do that will
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:16.640]  change my mind about that.
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:22.800]  Well, personally, I don't have any guns on me, but if I did, I probably wouldn't.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:27.240]  Just a matter of protection for myself or if I had a family for my family.
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:32.440]  I don't own any guns, so I don't have any to turn in.
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.280]  Do you think other people should turn them in?
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:35.280]  I do.
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:39.200]  I think you should follow the law and also I'm kind of against assault weapon guns and
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:43.400]  guns in general and I don't see that there's that much of a need for them.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.400]  If everyone turns them in, then you won't need them to defend against other people with.
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:53.000]  I don't own any assault weapons, but I am a gun owner and my guns would be in compliance
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.400]  with those new laws and so it wouldn't personally affect me.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:03.120]  But if I did own assault weapons, I would comply with the law because I don't think
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:09.300]  that other than the headstrong southern attitude that what's mine is mine, there's no reason
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:13.520]  to be owning assault weapons in a just personal setting.
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:18.720]  How do you feel about President Obama bringing children on stage as he talks about gun control,
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.720]  yet he's killed at least 168 kids in drone attacks in Pakistan?
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:27.840]  I think national security and domestic security are two different issues and that security
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.080]  abroad is a separate issue entirely from security inside the nation.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.720]  I feel that's kind of almost super critical in a way.
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:37.120]  Yeah, I don't agree with that.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:40.560]  I think that dragging kids into it and having them listen to all this stuff, they do need
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.000]  to be educated, but I think they're way too young and I think that's wrong.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.160]  I don't agree with that at all.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:48.400]  I mean, I don't think it's fair to bring kids onto the stage as he talks about it.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:53.840]  It's kind of unfair to make his point that way, but I think a life's a life and it shouldn't
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:55.000]  be lost either way.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  So I think it needs to be on both sides.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.240]  It needs to value the life of the children as much as Pakistani civilians.
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:07.800]  Maybe he feels bad about all the kids that he has unintentionally killed and he's trying
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.920]  to make up for that by saying that, by bringing the kids on stage.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:18.200]  No one is... He's not... In the way of asking the question, that way you're making the blame
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.480]  go specifically on a single person on the President of the United States when it's a
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:27.120]  much more complicated and complex issue and then in those sort of situations you can't
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:28.960]  place the blame on one person.
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:32.440]  Yes, people have died, but people die in any sort of conflict.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.240]  I don't personally agree with our presence in the Middle East, but I'm going to support
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:40.040]  our President in the sort of decisions he makes and I think that having drones in the
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:45.400]  Middle East saves American lives and when it comes down to it, American lives are what
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:47.720]  our policies are about saving.
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:52.080]  Now do you think it's un-American if local or state governments push back on the feds
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.960]  in relation to the assault weapons ban?
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.080]  No.
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:01.800]  I don't think it's un-American just because I think that within America each state does
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:06.960]  have its right to make their own laws.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:09.680]  I don't think that it's un-American.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:20.440]  I find that states, when they have enough reason to stray away from the national government,
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.640]  it is their right to do that.
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:27.040]  I guess it would be considered un-American to push the feds back because these are the
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.960]  same people that we expect to protect us and we're the same people who we expect to watch
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:34.120]  our homeland security.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.800]  And lastly, can you recite the Second Amendment?
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:38.440]  The Second Amendment.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.800]  No, I cannot at this point.
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:41.800]  I forgot clearly.
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:49.360]  On the first one, freedom of speech, the second one should be right to the press, isn't it?
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:50.360]  Right to press.
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:52.800]  Or it's probably that.
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:56.880]  I should feel ashamed of myself, though, wanting to be a lawyer.
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:58.540]  The right to bear arms.
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:01.480]  Every citizen should have the right to bear arms.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:06.000]  And it mentions in there something about a militia.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.800]  I used to know it.
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:09.600]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:10.600]  The right to bear arms.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:11.600]  Okay.
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:16.160]  And it mentions something about a militia in the Second Amendment.
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.160]  Okay.
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:20.920]  No, I have no idea what it is.
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.320]  Could you say it to me?
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.640]  I cannot.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:33.000]  Reporting for InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Ortiz.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:47.480]  There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:51.680]  of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.680]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com with a special report.
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:00.600]  Most people that watch television or even YouTube know that last Monday I debated Piers
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:05.960]  Morgan and got in his face and said, look, you're coming for our guns to enslave us.
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:08.800]  America is becoming a police state tyranny.
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:10.360]  Back off.
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:11.600]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:12.920]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:13.920]  Mao took the guns.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.400]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:16.880]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:22.480]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:25.680]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:26.840]  their guns taken.
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:28.320]  We will not relinquish them.
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.280]  Do you understand?
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.240]  Two days later, Ron Paul came on my show, outgoing congressman, and he agreed.
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:40.400]  He said, if they come for the guns, it's going to cause a civil war, 1776, part two.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:42.400]  Will you turn in your semi-autos?
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:50.520]  Well, I might not even have anything to turn in for that purpose, but I don't think the
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:52.000]  American people will.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.680]  I've always assumed that the line in the sand may well be drawn.
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:01.920]  If the federal agent marches in unannounced and they say, well, give me your gun and give
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:08.280]  me your gold, I don't think that we'll do that, you know, in a calm way.
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:12.840]  I think the American people will highly resent it and resist.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:18.000]  Now, as soon as I got off Piers Morgan, the White House released a press release and said
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.160]  they were watching and responded to our petition, your petition, to deport Piers Morgan for
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:30.580]  engaging in political subterfuge and trying to overthrow our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:32.000]  So we know they were watching.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.720]  It became the biggest story in the country and the biggest story on Twitter for two days
[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:36.720]  straight.
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:39.360]  It's had like 15 million views online on YouTube alone.
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.400]  So we know the White House is watching.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:46.600]  We also know that it's come out in Homeland Security documents that myself and Matt Drudge
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:51.720]  have been basically investigated and surveilled and are in secret documents concerning the
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:56.180]  TSA because we've been covering their out of control violations of the Fourth Amendment
[02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:59.100]  and conditioning the public to basically be slaves.
[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:04.160]  But then today I'm watching his speech while I'm live on the radio playing it.
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:08.360]  And he talks about these pundits out there who just want to make money.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.360]  And they say that.
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we had some technical difficulties with the Skype, but
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:13.920]  he's with us via phone.
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:17.320]  So we were doing a retransmission of some special reports there for the rest of the
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:18.400]  hour.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.400]  He's a busy guy.
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:25.160]  Cenk Uygur, of course, founder and host of The Young Turks, theyoungturks.com, is on
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.160]  with us.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:30.000]  He, of course, left MSNBC for several different reasons we're gonna talk about.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.080]  He went over to Current TV with Al Gore involved and the Hyatts and others.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:37.920]  And then now that's been bought out by Al Jazeera.
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:39.360]  And he joins us.
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:44.380]  He has one of the biggest media networks on the Internet out there, probably only rivaled
[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:50.600]  by Infowars.com or what Glenn Beck has developed over there with The Blaze.
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:54.100]  And then, of course, there's the big granddaddy of all the real alternative media and that's
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:55.100]  DrudgeReport.com.
[02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:57.880]  But, Cenk, it is good to have you on with us.
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:00.920]  I was looking forward to the full hour, but you promised to come back soon, as soon as
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:03.080]  we can get your Skype going for the TV viewers.
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:07.240]  But the radio listeners out there excited to hear you on the broadcast.
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:11.960]  Where should we begin in this discussion today?
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:19.400]  You tell me, Alex, we can talk policy, we can talk shows, politics, you let me know.
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:20.720]  Let's talk about you a little bit.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:21.720]  Most of the audience knows who you are.
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:22.720]  But, I mean, how did you get started?
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:24.920]  How did you form your political beliefs?
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.960]  Good question.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:31.280]  So when I was growing up, I was a liberal Republican in the Northeast that, of course,
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:32.800]  doesn't exist anymore.
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:33.800]  But it did back in the day.
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:34.800]  I voted for Tom Kane.
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:41.720]  Not voted for, I was too young, but supported Tom Kane, Whitman, etc., right?
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:45.480]  And then the Republicans lost me during George W. Bush.
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:50.360]  Gore was actually the first Democrat I ever voted for in 2000.
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:52.880]  They lost me on a couple things.
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:57.760]  The Clinton affair was fun and funny, but I thought it was crazy to impeach a president
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:17:58.760]  over that.
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:04.600]  Then they really lost me during the Iraq War, and then they really lost me during torture,
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:10.680]  and then they went down the spider hole of, you know, warrantless wiretapping, gigantic
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:16.560]  abuses of our rights and civil liberties, etc., and I consider myself an independent.
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:19.640]  The Democrats drive me absolutely crazy.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:25.280]  I am a progressive, meaning that I believe in expansion of freedom.
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:31.560]  I believe in protecting the middle class, etc., and there are some progressives in Congress,
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:35.500]  but not much, and Obama, I think, is nowhere near a progressive.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:37.000]  So that's your, in a nutshell.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  All right.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.560]  We got you on later today, I'm gonna skip this network break coming up, because I wanna
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:44.760]  get down to brass tax with you.
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:49.400]  You're obviously a smart guy, and so you know that both parties are bought and paid for
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:54.600]  by some of the very same globalist above the law, don't pay taxes interest.
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:59.520]  And that, I mean, who can deny the police state has been continued and accelerated by
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:05.440]  Obama with NDAA, they found torture camps in Benghazi, the rendition flights, all of
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.960]  it is continuing.
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:12.300]  And I've seen the so-called left suddenly become cheerleaders for it.
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:17.720]  You not so much, but I mean, still, it's just another wing of the same carrion bird.
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:21.800]  And then I come on your show and you're like, man, do you need mental help?
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:24.760]  You're so upset about all this, I don't think it's a conspiracy.
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:26.960]  Well, it's an open conspiracy.
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.480]  I mean, don't you care about your family, Cenk, you're a smart guy.
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:36.840]  You've got to know that if you've looked at history, the United States is absolutely headed
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.400]  over the edge of a cliff, politically, economically, culturally.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:48.560]  I mean, this country is rotting socioeconomically on so many fronts morally, and the police
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.020]  are dressed in Darth Vader outfits, the NSA spying on us.
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:55.600]  And they're talking about Obama's gonna be the new Lincoln and crush the states, I mean,
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:56.600]  this is creepy.
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:01.760]  All right, so, Alex, I actually totally agree with you on three out of four things.
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:05.840]  It's just the fourth one, we have a wild, complete disagreement, okay?
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:07.760]  So let me tell you what I agree with you on.
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:10.360]  So does money control politics?
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:11.920]  Of course it does.
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:18.320]  And watching television drives me crazy, where they talk about, oh, Joe Lieberman had this
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:24.520]  policy idea and Senator X cares about this ideology, that's nonsense.
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.640]  The only thing that matters is what their donors tell them to do.
[02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:32.200]  I mean, New York Times had a brilliant article about how this pharmaceutical company, Amgen,
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:38.320]  just bought a $500 million exemption in the latest fiscal cliff deal.
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:39.320]  It makes me sick.
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:40.480]  And by the way, who'd they buy?
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:46.320]  They bought Republicans and Democrats, Max Baucus, Obama, McConnell, and Orrin Hatch.
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:48.440]  So I totally agree on that.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:52.240]  Well, take Al Gore, take Al Gore getting all that oil money.
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:56.760]  I mean, how many, tens of millions, what is it, 100 million some estimates?
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:02.280]  And we all know that Al Jazeera is backed by a government.
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:05.040]  Well, let me leave that aside for now.
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.640]  We can get back into it because I don't think it's as directly pertinent to our current
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:12.280]  sitting politicians that take the money for specific acts.
[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:14.480]  But let me just finish real quick.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:19.680]  Police state, I agree with you, the NDAA, warrantless wiretapping, it's encroaching
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:25.920]  power begets power, and there's never an end to how much power they can have, okay?
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:30.200]  So I agree with you on that, too.
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:34.760]  But the final piece of the puzzle, when you talk about the reasons why, that's where
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:36.320]  we have the huge disagreement, Alex.
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:38.480]  And look, I think the reasons are super obvious.
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:44.200]  I mean, you said a conspiracy out in the open, I mean, if you want to talk about a conspiracy
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:50.040]  out in the open, the lobbyists say, we will give $100,000 to this guy, and we will hire
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:53.240]  his chief of staff, and we will hire him after he retires.
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:56.880]  They funnel all this money, and then they get the money back.
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:03.240]  And then you've got Congress insider trading, so the power is all massing, and foreign corporations
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:06.200]  and global corporations are taking control.
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:11.760]  Don't you see then the wisdom for the people to be armed as a balance of power, as a check
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:12.760]  and a balance?
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:16.680]  I understand what you're saying there, Alex, but I think it's unrealistic in a couple of
[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:20.440]  different ways, and I think it has a huge downside, okay?
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:25.520]  So number one, when I say it's unrealistic, look, man, we can have all the guns you want,
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:29.040]  and we could be out in the woods when the government comes with drones, if they want
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.040]  to do that.
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:33.760]  I don't think they're gonna do that, but if they wanted to do that, I mean, they'd blow
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:34.760]  us out of the sky.
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:38.280]  You can have 28 AK-47s, you're never gonna be a drone.
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:39.280]  Really?
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:40.280]  Really?
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:41.280]  200,000 US troops couldn't hold Baghdad.
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:45.120]  I believe you're wrong about that, and our people are inside the military.
[02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:51.000]  If they start trying to use the drones, even if they're automated and controlled by the
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.080]  globalist, the people in the military are gonna wreck those systems.
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:23:00.520]  Humans are powerful machines, there's hundreds of millions of us, again, I've been to the
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:05.280]  urban warfare drills where the military trains against US role players to confiscate guns
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:06.680]  in US cities, Cenk.
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:11.880]  I have the army manuals, in fact, I can give you one of them for gun confiscation in FEMA
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:17.840]  camps and how to round up civil disturbance operations, FM3-39.40.
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:23.040]  I mean, there I am giving you the actual document number, you can look it up.
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.060]  This is real is what I'm telling you.
[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:27.280]  The 1.6 billion bullets the government bought.
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:31.000]  I mean, if they've got drones, why do they want 1.6 billion bullets?
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.840]  Because it's boots on the ground, they're gonna have to come in our houses.
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:38.840]  Well, I can answer why they want the 1.6 billion bullets, cuz somebody made money off of it.
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:44.520]  There's a bullet maker, they bribed the legalized bribery that they do of politicians, and so
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:47.320]  the government bought 1.6 billion bullets they don't need.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:51.160]  Like, there's one other point of agreement we have, which is that I think there's gonna
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:55.600]  be a gigantic collapse coming, and I think what happens after the collapse is enormously
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:56.600]  important.
[02:23:56.600 --> 02:24:02.360]  And we might disagree as to why that collapse is coming, but our main point of disagreement
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:04.800]  is when you start talking about the FEMA camps, et cetera.
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:09.200]  Look, I don't think there's a government plan to put us in FEMA camps, or to kill us, or
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:12.160]  to take us over, cuz they don't need it.
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:16.480]  They already have the government, look, Alex, the only thing they care about is making more
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:17.480]  money.
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:20.720]  And right now, they have almost 100% control of the government, and they can make all the
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:21.920]  money they want.
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:24.640]  Why would they wanna disturb that system?
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:28.240]  They're milking us dry on that count anyway.
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:34.200]  Well, I get the points you're making, and it's true that we've already been taken over,
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:36.880]  they're already looting us, so why physically do it?
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:40.120]  It is the instinct of tyrants to fully dominate.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:44.400]  I mean, why did Hitler, after he'd already taken France, just not stop there?
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:48.640]  Why did he turn off into Russia, where Napoleon and every other empire went to die?
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.520]  It is the nature of these people, so you come off as a real guy, and I'm a pretty good judge
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.960]  of people, and so you are judging other people by how you operate.
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:03.940]  And I don't blame you not wanting to talk about Al Gore and people, but I mean, Al Gore
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:09.600]  has the carbon trading company over in London, and would literally make money off of every
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:12.520]  human activity we make if he gets carbon taxes through.
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:16.080]  I mean, that isn't about the environment, it's about a power grab.
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.680]  No, no, Alex, I don't mind talking about Gore, I wanted to talk about your specific question
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:21.680]  first.
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:25.960]  But look, I don't know all the investments that Al Gore has at all, right?
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:29.960]  I do know somebody comes in, like Al just heard, and they make an offer that appears
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:35.000]  to be fantastic, above market value, if you ask me, and I don't know the specifics, I'm
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.720]  just guessing from the outside, I'm not involved in the deal at all.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:39.880]  Anybody would have taken it.
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:44.400]  So does that, I mean, he's not in power anymore politically, I don't, you know, so there isn't
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:49.080]  any, I don't think any extra favors to be had, he just got an awesome price and he took
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:50.080]  it.
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:57.680]  Now, the carbon tax thing, look, I just don't believe at all that it's meant to be a money-making
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:03.440]  enterprise, and I've talked to him at length for a long, long time, the man deeply cares
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:04.440]  about global warming.
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:06.040]  Now, you might disagree with him.
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:10.040]  No, he deeply cares about the carbon's writing he'll make billions off of, of course he does.
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:14.000]  He deeply cares about the Apple, Foxcom, suicide nets.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  Does he deeply care about the-
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.760]  Now, you told me you do the same thing, though, and here, let me explain what I mean by that.
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:22.480]  Like, for example, you think the economy is in trouble, so you invest in gold, right?
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:23.480]  We talked about that before.
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:24.480]  Yes.
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:25.480]  So then you make money off of that.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:28.600]  Well, if that makes sense to you, that's where you thought the economy was going.
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:32.040]  I don't even blame the hedge fund guys like John Paulson, who thought, wait a minute,
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:36.040]  these toxic mortgages are crap, I'm gonna bet against them, and they made billions off
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:37.120]  of that, right?
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:42.320]  So if Al Gore sees that this fossil fuel industry is unsustainable, and he's right about that,
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:47.040]  and it's hurting our health, our wealth, everything else, and he bets in the opposite direction,
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:49.040]  well, that's logical, I'd do the same thing.
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:53.240]  Yeah, but carbon taxes are selectively enforced only against the West and designed to shut
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:56.880]  down our development, and then move it to Chinese investments and Indian investments
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.640]  that people like Al Gore have.
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:05.520]  It's a managed crony capitalist economy, and it's completely cold-blooded.
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:10.000]  It was Gore that got up there on Larry King Live and said, it's a great deal, Larry, I
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.120]  deeply believe in NAFTA and GATT.
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:14.080]  How has NAFTA and GATT been for us?
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.800]  Well, look, I was in favor of NAFTA, and I thought, even though I was a Republican at
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:25.400]  the time, I thought Gore clearly won the debate against Ross Perot on that issue, et cetera,
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:29.960]  but NAFTA has had some significant downsides, there's no question about that, and I'll tell
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:36.000]  you, at this point, I get that a lot of the global trade deals are done for the benefit
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:42.160]  of corporations, and to our great detriment, I mean, look, I'll tell you, I'll give you
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:46.500]  one example that really proves that case, it's the Panama deal, there's almost no trade
[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:52.800]  with Panama in terms of business, commodities, et cetera, but Panama protects the bankers,
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:58.120]  and so recent trade deal that Obama did, he included Panama in the deal with other countries,
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:27:59.120]  why?
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:03.040]  Because it created a giant loophole for the bankers to pay no taxes.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:05.000]  Now, come on, why would you do that?
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.560]  I mean, especially if you're claiming to be a progressive, liberal Democrat, and you give
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:16.080]  the bankers this giant, multi-billion dollar loophole, no, it's because the corporations
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:20.960]  run the place, Dick Durbin said it, he said, the banks own Capitol Hill.
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:24.600]  So on that count, there's no question.
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:34.020]  We're talking to the founder of the popular internet and TV and radio empire, Jink joins
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:41.320]  us right now, theyoungturks.com is the main website, one of many they have.
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:45.600]  Look, here's how my brain works.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:48.040]  They're sitting there going, come on.
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:52.720]  So Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, a few others, they knew the derivatives were garbage, so
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:53.720]  they bet against them.
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:29:00.280]  Yeah, but they also sold them to their clients and originally got the law changed in 99 to
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:01.840]  be able to sell the crap.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:02.840]  So they-
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:03.840]  Totally true.
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:04.840]  Totally true.
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:05.840]  That was fraud.
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:09.800]  And so when you talk about the guys who sold it to their clients and then shorted it and
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:12.360]  then bet against it, well, that's just outright fraud.
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:17.000]  Those guys should be in jail and Goldman Sachs and all those guys did it and then John Polson,
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:24.720]  so I might've picked a poor example because he worked with Goldman Sachs to sell the toxic
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:27.440]  stuff to other people while he was betting against it.
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:32.920]  But there were some people, like if you read the big short by, was it Michael Lewis?
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:37.760]  Stay there, Jink, Uger is our guest and we're going to be right back, founder and head of
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:38.760]  the Young Turks.
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:42.120]  We're going to get into a whole bunch of other issues, second amendment, you name it.
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:44.520]  And what he thinks the collapse is going to look like.
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:46.480]  And is he worried about martial law?
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:50.640]  All this and more coming up.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:51.920]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.320]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.320 --> 02:30:01.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:06.760]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:11.340]  like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:13.200]  by a disastrous economy?
[02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.920]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:19.720]  At e foods direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[02:30:19.720 --> 02:30:22.640]  life storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:27.180]  After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York city wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:32.000]  are closed, but I managed to get my e foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000]  and niece.
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.800]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

[02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:05.380]  We are on the march.
[02:33:05.380 --> 02:33:08.400]  The empire is on the run.
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:12.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:20.520]  Jinky Uygur of the Young Turks is our guest and they've had a lot of fun with me over
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:22.800]  the years making jokes out of things.
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:30.520]  Talk about the CPS taking people's kids, we can discuss that.
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:35.240]  Also the so-called liberal media is running like a four year old video of me talking about
[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:38.880]  juice boxes to make you gay and they take it out of context.
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:45.360]  I'm pointing out that animals, mammals, you name it, are becoming sterile or bisexual
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:47.120]  or having both organs.
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:53.260]  Girls are going into puberty now at average of age 10, used to be 14, boys, testicles
[02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:57.360]  are not dropping, genitals are smaller, they're becoming feminine, women are becoming hyper
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:04.400]  feminine, the bisphenol and other things are directly linked to cancer and infertility.
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:07.860]  All of this and the media just says, you're making fun of gay people, it has nothing to
[02:34:07.860 --> 02:34:08.860]  do with that.
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:13.440]  It's a way to get the news out to say, are the juice boxes making you gay coming up?
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:16.400]  And then I'm like, well, actually it's doing a bunch of stuff.
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:18.600]  But what's your take on that, Jink?
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:27.020]  All right, so first of all, I'm joking around with stuff and we drive people crazy and people
[02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:30.520]  don't like it when we joke around about them, but we do it all the time and we do it to
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:31.520]  everybody.
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:32.520]  Okay.
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:36.240]  And the audience likes serious stuff, but they like lighthearted stuff too.
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:41.160]  And so, and Paul Krugman the other day got all hurt over John Stewart making fun of him,
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:44.120]  but that's just life and everybody's got to get used to that.
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:47.840]  People make fun of us all the time and that just rolls off my back.
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:51.240]  No, no, I don't mind you making fun of me, I mean, I'm a funny guy as well, I think you're
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:52.240]  a funny guy.
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:55.520]  I mean, how does that tie into the juice box stuff?
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:56.520]  Okay.
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:57.520]  They're really saying that I'm-
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:02.080]  Okay, so on that front, on that front, look, you know, you mentioned three different things
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:03.080]  there.
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:04.080]  Let me take child protective services.
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:09.960]  Now, this is, again, it goes to our fundamental disagreement, Alex, like if you say that child
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:14.520]  protective services goes too far in some instances, I'm going to totally agree with you.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:19.280]  And I bet you could find five, 10, 20, 100 cases throughout the country where you say,
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:20.680]  look at this, look at this, look at this.
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:24.760]  Now, if you think child protection services is some sort of conspiracy where they're all
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:29.120]  coordinating with one another to take people's kids, that's where I totally disagree with
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:30.120]  you.
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:33.880]  I got a neighbor who's in that, my wife used to be in that, there's no conspiracy.
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:37.280]  They're trying to do the best they can, and a lot of times people screw up.
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:38.280]  That's it.
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:39.520]  Well, let me add my point.
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:44.560]  Half of CPS roughly, about 54% nationally, people can look these numbers up, turns over.
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:49.040]  Because people get in it for the right reasons, and it's so bad most people quit.
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:50.440]  Sounds like your wife did.
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:53.440]  I know there's about 50% or more that are good people.
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:57.200]  But you are five times more likely, according to the Justice Department, even Time Magazine's
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:03.480]  covered this, to be abused in government custody, CPS, than you are in anybody else's custody.
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:09.520]  They put the average foster child on seven psychotropics, 67% are on psychotropics.
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:10.920]  I mean, it is a mill.
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:12.760]  But Alex, that's not a conspiracy.
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:16.440]  So they over-prescribe, I agree with you, and if you're talking about, hey, there's
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:22.120]  a financial incentive for the drug companies to set up an incentive system so they over-prescribe,
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:23.120]  I'm with you.
[02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:25.560]  And I think they over-prescribe, right?
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:29.320]  But it's not like the government's saying, okay, ha, ha, ha, we will get these kids and
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:32.720]  we'll put them on psychotropic drugs and we will, you know.
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:34.920]  It doesn't work on that way.
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:38.400]  It's actually in some ways more malicious than that in the sense that once you set up
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:41.520]  a machine to do X, it will keep doing X.
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:45.160]  And so they've turned government into a money-making machine.
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:49.920]  So there is no smoke-filled room where CPS got together and said, let's drug up the kids.
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:54.600]  It's just, if the drug companies have the financial incentive, they buy the politicians,
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:55.600]  the politicians write the rules-
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:56.600]  Okay.
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:36:57.600]  Then my point is-
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:58.600]  They wind up having more drugs.
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:02.700]  Regardless then, it's going on, we should stand up and say it's wrong.
[02:37:02.700 --> 02:37:08.120]  But the Democrats generally are pro-government and so, no, let's not criticize the government.
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:09.600]  Let's just let it continue on.
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:12.160]  The Republicans are pro-government to their buddies.
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.060]  They don't want their stuff cut either.
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:19.000]  And all I'm saying is, like Nixon said, it is a big out of control beast.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.840]  It is an out of control machine that nobody can control except the establishment on top
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.680]  is trying to ride the beast and we're being trampled under it.
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:34.240]  Yeah, and look, when people ask, is government too big, too small, that's my favorite question
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:36.000]  because it makes no sense.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.280]  It's like saying, all right, how big a pipe do you need?
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:39.840]  Well, I don't know.
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:40.840]  What's the job we're doing?
[02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:41.840]  Are we carrying oil?
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:43.840]  Are we carrying a tiny amount of water?
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:44.840]  What do you mean?
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:46.560]  Well, how big is the pipe you want, right?
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:50.040]  So it depends on the job that the government is doing.
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:55.480]  So is the government too large when it has this enormously bloated Defense Department?
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:56.800]  It starts aggressive wars?
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:37:58.880]  Hell yeah, it's too large.
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:01.280]  Is it too large when it gets into our private lives?
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:04.120]  In my case, I think, you know, I'm pro-choice.
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:10.040]  I think them getting between us and our doctor is way too large, you know, and so you can
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:11.840]  list a dozen ways that it's too large.
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:14.680]  You can also list a dozen ways that I think it's too small.
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:19.800]  Like, for example, the whole reason why I'm not a small-time olive picker in the middle
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.660]  of southeastern Turkey is because the Turkish government allowed my dad to get a free education
[02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:27.520]  because he scored high on an interest exam.
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:31.800]  That's the government saying, hey, we're going to give everybody an opportunity with their
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:32.800]  poor...
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:36.800]  They do that to find, under the eugenics model, and I'm not saying, I'm not judging Turkey's
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:37.800]  models.
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:41.520]  I'm not enough of an expert on it, you know, 60 years ago or whatever, though I know quite
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:44.160]  a bit more than the general public does about the history of it.
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:49.760]  My issue is they do that to pick and find the brains to make sure that there aren't
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:55.600]  what they call wild sons or bad sons out there that grow up and get power outside of the
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:56.840]  power structure.
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:57.840]  Let's expand on this.
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:05.480]  Golfer Phil Mickelson pays over 63, 64% in federal and just state income tax.
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:10.480]  If you add in the property tax and all the other taxes, it's over about 74% for somebody
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:12.280]  making as much money as he does.
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:13.280]  Come on.
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:14.280]  I don't believe that.
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:15.280]  I don't believe that.
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:16.280]  Well, I mean...
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:17.480]  I don't think that's accurate at all.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:20.200]  I pay close to 60% in taxes.
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:26.360]  Yeah, I mean, look, if you're adding everything, if you're adding local taxes, property taxes,
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:30.560]  which is a whole different ballgame, sales tax, you might get the 60%.
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:33.760]  But if you've got the 60%, that means you're making a hell of a good living.
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:38.920]  I mean, I got friends making millions of dollars and then they say that in the end, and they
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:42.000]  live in New York, which is heavily taxed, they're at around 50%.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.040]  Yeah, worse than that.
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:45.040]  Are you kidding?
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:46.040]  In New York?
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:54.720]  Hey, Obama just hired that French researcher, top economist lady, to help tune international
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:56.480]  economics with the US.
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:02.400]  That woman is somebody pushing for the 75% taxes on top of everything you make above
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:03.400]  75%.
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:05.840]  I mean, the government needs 90%.
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.080]  France is the model.
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:10.960]  Futile serfs only paid 10% in ancient Europe.
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:15.840]  But Alex, if you remember the golden years of America from about 1945 to 1980, when our
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:22.080]  economy did the best, more accurately, probably 45 to 75, the tax rate was anywhere between
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:23.080]  71 to 94%.
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:27.120]  But the loopholes were so big, that's not actually the case.
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:30.200]  Kennedy cut some of the highest tax rates by 35%.
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:32.560]  The median tax income by 50%.
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:33.640]  Tax receipts doubled.
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:37.920]  Why does government want higher taxes when they know generally tax cuts increases revenue?
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:39.720]  Or do you disagree with that?
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:41.280]  I do disagree with that.
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:45.520]  So when Kennedy cut taxes, they were still above 70%.
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:47.840]  And remember, that's for the highest marginal tax rate.
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:52.940]  So that's for every dollar above whatever the threshold is, right?
[02:40:52.940 --> 02:40:59.000]  So if Kennedy doubled the revenue and he was at 70% for the highest marginal tax rate,
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  well, that's not so bad.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.660]  Now, look, I think that's too high.
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:07.160]  For my personal taste, I think, and that's why my family supported Reagan when we first
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:08.160]  came here.
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:11.520]  Because at that time, if you remember before Reagan, the highest marginal tax rate was
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:12.520]  70%.
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:14.440]  I thought that was outrageously high.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.280]  But now we've got it to a point where it's far too low.
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:21.960]  Look, when Clinton raised the taxes to 39% for the top rate, what happened?
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:24.640]  The economy, boom, we added 23 million jobs.
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:27.120]  Bush cut it, also Obama cut it.
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:28.120]  And what happened?
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:29.120]  We lost jobs.
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:30.120]  We didn't gain jobs.
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:31.120]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:36.240]  Obama promised not to increase payroll tax, and he increased it on 77% of Americans.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:39.940]  People making $30,000 got an increase, what, 3.8%.
[02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:42.400]  There's all sorts of taxes being increased.
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:43.960]  Here's my big issue with taxes.
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:48.920]  If you had an angel, a good angel, distributing it all, it would still make people slaves
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:52.580]  in the final equation and not make you independent and make you domesticated.
[02:41:52.580 --> 02:41:57.040]  The establishment, the richest people in the world, come and lobby for higher taxes cuz
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:01.080]  they know they're always gonna have loopholes and are exempt, Warren Buffett and people
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.080]  like that.
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:04.920]  And then they end up getting the money in banker bailouts and corporate welfare.
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:10.840]  They're trying to shut down the Small Business Association in the federal government administration.
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:14.880]  They take our tax money and then they give it back to select insiders.
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:16.920]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:18.680]  Some of that is true.
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:23.080]  For example, the role of how big business crushes small business is one of the most
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:27.080]  underreported stories in the country because they want a competitive advantage so they
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:32.240]  set the rules in the government so that it is to their advantage and against small businesses.
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:36.640]  But no, overall, most of the rich don't want higher taxes at all.
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:40.600]  Warren Buffett is someone that everybody talks about cuz he's such an exception.
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:45.760]  All the hedge fund guys, the private equity guys on Wall Street, cry bloody murder if
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:50.760]  you touch their taxes by 1% and they're paying 15%, which is outrageously low.
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:52.480]  Yeah, they wrote the laws.
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:53.480]  They wrote the laws.
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:57.680]  And it's the very same mega banks and Wall Street people that fund the Democrats and
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:58.680]  Republicans.
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:42:59.680]  I mean, look at Romney.
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:03.880]  He was funded by the exact same groups, except for the Koch brothers, so you guys always
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:05.420]  use them all day.
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:07.920]  But the point is, is that now they flipped against the Republicans.
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:13.840]  I mean, it's just such a cynical game and any big government is gonna create that trough
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:16.680]  for the fraud, waste, and abuse to take place.
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:17.680]  That's totally true.
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:23.760]  And the Democrats and Republicans are playing us all day long and Fox News and MSNBC set
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:28.680]  up this false debate, this false drama, my God, is it gonna be the Democrats, is it gonna
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:29.920]  be the Republicans?
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:30.920]  What difference does it make?
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:36.400]  Obama renewed, in fact, he didn't just renew, he made the Bush tax cuts permanent for 99%
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:37.400]  of Americans.
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:39.480]  So that's the 1% change we voted for.
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:41.040]  I mean, look, you're upset.
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:46.880]  If you're a progressive, we're 10 times more upset cuz they never do anything progressive.
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:47.880]  Never, why?
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:51.800]  Cuz Wall Street and the guys who pay the politicians aren't progressive at all.
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:53.040]  They're massively conservative.
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:54.680]  No, they're selective.
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:59.040]  They selectively enforce it on the general public and then they're exempt from it all.
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:03.360]  So cynical with Bill Gates and all them up there talking about, race taxes, rich people
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:04.480]  don't pay enough.
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:08.360]  Knowing it's all written where they can be tax-free in their tax-free foundations.
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:09.360]  Look-
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:15.320]  Alex, let me ask you a more fundamental question, and I always wonder this about libertarians.
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:17.240]  So how much government do you believe in?
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:19.040]  So I mean, you gotta have some government, right?
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:21.840]  You gotta have police, firemen, teachers, etc.
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:25.520]  So we obviously have to have some taxes to support that government.
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:28.880]  So what do you think is an ideal tax rate and how much government would you want?
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:32.880]  Well, that is a huge discussion, incredibly complex.
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:36.520]  Cuz like Ron Paul stated, we've gotten so domesticated, it'll take 50 years to even
[02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:37.960]  wean off this.
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:42.440]  But if we don't turn the ship around and start going back at least in a partially different
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.760]  direction, we know it's all going bankrupt and gonna collapse and then there'll be nothing,
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:47.760]  Cenk.
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:50.800]  Yeah, but it isn't gonna collapse because of these things.
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:55.400]  The main reason that it's gonna collapse is because we allow the banks to do unlimited
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:44:56.400]  gambling.
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:59.200]  And unfortunately, they control such a huge percentage of our GDP.
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:04.840]  And then government backs and guarantees it, government then backs and signs us onto it.
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:07.360]  No, look, again, that's our fundamental agreement.
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:12.600]  They've captured the government and JP Morgan alone, and this is in an Atlantic article
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:18.800]  you can read, well, it's public in a range you can see anywhere, trades $74 trillion
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:19.800]  worth of derivatives.
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.040]  Now, that doesn't mean they're risking $74 trillion.
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:26.400]  But it does mean that is the number of the amount of trading they're doing.
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:32.080]  So any slight error is gonna lead to enormous uncontrollable losses.
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:36.080]  And any gambler will tell you, if you take enough risks, at some point, you're gonna
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:37.080]  blow it.
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:39.720]  And these guys are definitely going to blow it.
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:45.560]  Your $74 trillion is five times the size of the US economy, and that's just one bank.
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.560]  By the way, you know worldwide, it's estimated by the Washington Post to be 1.5 quadrille.
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.600]  Yeah, it's insanity.
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:54.360]  So that's gonna blow up.
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:57.120]  It's gonna take the whole world economy down with it.
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:01.440]  What I'm afraid of is that people are gonna take that and then misinterpret what happened
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:02.440]  there.
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:05.480]  And the answer in that case, Alex, isn't less government.
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:08.640]  The answer is more regulation, more honest government.
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:12.120]  Yeah, after the bankers have collapsed and taken everything over, they shut the game
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:14.800]  down so nobody else can even basically do anything.
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:16.080]  See, that's the problem.
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:17.440]  They know this is gonna screw up.
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:18.680]  They signed us onto it.
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:22.000]  Then they implode it, then they pose as saviors, then they bring government in.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:26.440]  We go from 25 million on food stamps to 50 million to 100 million, and then we're all
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:30.080]  completely domesticated, and the social engineers win.
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:32.500]  Let me shift gears with you.
[02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:39.240]  General Boykin, former head of Special Forces Command, is in CNS news today talking about
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:41.520]  how there's evidence that our government's arming al-Qaeda.
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:47.400]  Well, come on, that's in the New York Times even, against Libya, in Benghazi, now in Syria.
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:48.580]  They're doing horrible things.
[02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:51.220]  They're making sure the Arab Spring doesn't become something good.
[02:46:51.220 --> 02:46:54.000]  They're making sure that Saudi Arabia runs it.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:57.300]  Where you're from, Turkey, so I know you have knowledge about this, is helping bring them
[02:46:57.300 --> 02:46:59.520]  in with the US and NATO.
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:03.780]  And I'm not saying Assad's a good guy, but compared to al-Qaeda, he's a wonderful guy.
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:07.960]  And they are killing Christians, they are killing Alawite minority Muslims.
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:08.960]  It is unprecedented.
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:12.440]  Obama, it was called peace bombs when he did Libya.
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.160]  I mean, what is your take on where this is going, where the TSA wants to look for bin
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:24.040]  Laden in my underwear, and in my wife's brassiere, and in my daughter's underwear, and my son's
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:29.900]  underwear, but then the government is openly funding and CFR admits those groups are led
[02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:30.900]  by al-Qaeda.
[02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:32.280]  I mean, what about that?
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:34.560]  I mean, should we give Obama another peace prize?
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:37.620]  How about 10 more?
[02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:39.400]  I'm really conflicted on this one.
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:41.380]  I'm not conflicted on this peace prize.
[02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:42.380]  That was insanity.
[02:47:42.380 --> 02:47:46.520]  He hadn't even done anything yet, and once he did something, we found out he wasn't altogether
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:48.920]  that interested in peace.
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:55.200]  But look, when I see Qaddafi oppressing and killing and butchering his own people, and
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:58.600]  I see it with Assad, I want to do something about it.
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:03.220]  But doing something is a really hard question.
[02:48:03.220 --> 02:48:04.860]  What are you supposed to do?
[02:48:04.860 --> 02:48:09.800]  And I totally understand that the more we get involved, and I think here Ron Paul makes
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:17.280]  a lot of good points, the more blowback we get, and we constantly seem to be funding
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:19.320]  and training the wrong people.
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:22.160]  Look at what happened in Mali.
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:24.000]  We trained some of the guys in Libya.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.840]  They go over to Mali, and then they turn off.
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:26.840]  Oh, it's all an accident.
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:27.840]  Then we got to invade.
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:31.240]  Oh, we got to invade all of Africa with Africa now.
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:35.360]  I said four years ago in Obama deception, they'd use al-Qaeda to invade those very countries
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:36.360]  and do this.
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:37.360]  You know how I knew?
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:39.000]  There's Pentagon public white papers.
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.760]  They think we're so, see, Cenk, I've got West Point documents from four years ago, and last
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:48.400]  year, and now this year, where they're trying to take on gun owners and take our guns.
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:53.000]  That's why I know, Cenk, they're coming, because I have the army manuals.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:54.720]  I have the army sources.
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:58.560]  Do you understand what's gonna happen when they come for the guns, bro?
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:01.720]  Okay, I just, I keep going back to it.
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:04.160]  It is totally unnecessary.
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:08.360]  What they would do if they came for guns is they would stir up the biggest S storm you
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:09.360]  ever seen-
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:10.360]  They're trying right now.
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:11.360]  The five star-
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:14.560]  Why would they bother doing that when they've already got the whole system on lockdown?
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:15.560]  I mean-
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:16.560]  They're not.
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:17.560]  No, no, you don't know about the-
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:19.880]  They can't bring a single dollar out of us if they possibly can.
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:22.400]  Mao said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:24.480]  Our four founders knew that as well.
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:26.480]  They just wanted the people to have the power.
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:27.640]  Don't you get that, man?
[02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:28.640]  Don't you trust yourself?
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:33.760]  I mean, Alex, think about what kind of, look, you can't do through guns and violence if
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:35.680]  you're gonna fight back against the government.
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:40.440]  You've gotta do it the King way, the Gandhi way, because if you try to outgun them, you
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:41.440]  know what Gandhi said?
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:45.400]  He said, part of the reason we didn't use guns is because we didn't have them.
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:47.760]  Now, you would take that as an example for your side.
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:52.600]  I actually say, well, of course Gandhi was never going to beat the British with weapons.
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:54.720]  They have so many more weapons.
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:57.440]  The way you beat them is by other means.
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:01.320]  And so if you do it democratically, you do it politically, and you get people riled up
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:02.320]  and you say-
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:04.960]  Cenk, Cenk, how much military history have you studied?
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:09.120]  Listen, we couldn't, our entire military couldn't defeat the North Vietnamese cuz they had a
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:10.120]  will to fight.
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:13.200]  The rifleman is the power, okay?
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:17.560]  There are 160 million gun owners plus in this country.
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:19.920]  Alex, you're gonna give them an excuse to kill you, okay?
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:25.880]  I mean, the minute you pick up a gun, they're gonna feel absolutely justified in striking
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:26.880]  back against you everywhere possible.
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:27.880]  Cenk, Cenk, there you go, there you go.
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:29.400]  I'm not picking up a gun.
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:31.760]  I don't wanna have a physical conflict.
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.020]  They are preparing to try to confiscate the guns and demonize gun owners as in the Homeland
[02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:39.100]  Security documents that we broke three and a half years ago.
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:43.600]  They wanna start a civil war and then call us terrorists, and you'll be like, well, they
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:45.360]  killed Ron Paul and Alex Jones.
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:47.540]  They had to, they were gonna lead a revolution.
[02:50:47.540 --> 02:50:48.540]  See how that spinning works?
[02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:51.640]  I wanna give you some statistics when we come back.
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:53.280]  I can't wait to have you back on Skype.
[02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:55.780]  I saw how great your Skype looked before it failed.
[02:50:55.780 --> 02:51:01.460]  There in your Young Turks studio, theyoungturks.com, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:01.460 --> 02:51:03.720]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:04.720]  Answer this.
[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:08.920]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:13.500]  thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:17.720]  recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:19.640]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:24.760]  This year, about one in every 50 US homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:29.220]  picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:51:29.220 --> 02:51:34.120]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[02:51:34.120 --> 02:51:37.200]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:40.200]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:44.920]  And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure
[02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:47.200]  house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:58.360]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV, that's 877-532-5388, or go to faketv.com.
[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:00.680]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:02.240]  Hi there.
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:03.240]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:03.240 --> 02:52:07.200]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:13.760]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:18.480]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that
[02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:23.600]  are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:25.800]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:30.440]  Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:31.520]  goes.
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:37.160]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:39.600]  and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:43.360]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:45.080]  in the last three months.
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:50.440]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:51.560]  your home.
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:57.520]  So watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:53:01.520]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:05.060]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:20.760]  day.

[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:18.600]  big DC trip next month, he'll come back with us in March or so via video Skype.
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:24.580]  This is the last sin that you've ever seen that has ever been revealed.
[02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:26.960]  He's going to be immediately confirmed.
[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:33.000]  You can go to the network on YouTube, you can watch this.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:39.120]  He's going to be a man in a car, he's going to be a woman in a car, who's going to get
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:44.660]  But I brought Melissa Melton in because she was gonna be on earlier today, but then I ran out of time and Melissa
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:50.520]  We've got FBI statistics from fbi.gov for TV viewers. We're gonna be putting these up on screen for radio listeners
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:56.560]  The video will be posted later today and info wars calm go over these statistics for jink so he can respond
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:02.820]  Well, the situation is that we have a lot of media and politicians that are throwing out statistics and they don't cite their sources
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:07.720]  So we don't know if those are coming from think tanks or special interest groups. This is from the fbi.gov
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:13.500]  They collect this data from 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country every and private groups have studied
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:16.740]  It's some of the most accurate numbers out there what they're not usually fans of government numbers
[02:55:16.740 --> 02:55:18.300]  But but this is this is what we have
[02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:22.740]  It's the most consistent over the years and using basic calculations for percentages
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:26.020]  You can see by that their own data that goes back to 1992
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:32.080]  the uniform crime report shows violent crime has been cut in half since 1992 and if you take the
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:38.200]  1992 violent crime rate per 100,000 people of seven five seven point seven you subtract the 2011 violent crime rate of
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:45.080]  386 point three you get three seventy one point four if you divide this by the original 1992 rate you get point four nine
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:51.800]  Oh two multiply that out and you're gonna have a decrease right there of forty nine point zero two percent in violent crime between
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:58.400]  1992 and 2011 and the murder rate shows the same decrease as well. Actually we can go to that
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:02.160]  So people think it's the end of the world and everybody's dying
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:08.440]  But the truth is the only thing going up is mass school shootings and that's 88 a year about half of those gangbangers killing each
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:14.080]  Other it's still a bad thing. But I mean Biden going riddled with holes beautiful children. I mean, it's so exploitive
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:18.020]  We're gonna go to more numbers here in a moment. Hit pause on that but jink rubbing respond
[02:56:18.020 --> 02:56:23.920]  I mean almost a 50% cut as more guns get bought as the criminals get scared in the last 20 years
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:29.880]  So Alex, there's about 12 different possibilities as to why the crime rate started going down in the early 1990s
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:34.080]  I wrote a I should say I read a brilliant article in Mother Jones about this
[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:39.700]  And we have the Kevin drum on the show to talk about it and I was really skeptical about it
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:46.460]  But it turns out the one thing that correlates with crime increases and decrease is lead
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:51.920]  Okay, and so the leaded gasoline really screwed this country up in a big big way now
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:56.400]  To me I get that the crime rate is going down and that's terrific thing
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:00.040]  And again, there's a lot of is that why we all beat the hell out of each other in the 80s
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:05.920]  Anyway, I'm sorry. Go ahead
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:07.640]  but
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:09.800]  the problem with with the guns isn't
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:15.800]  necessarily the crime rate as much as it is gun homicides and of course these massacres and then you know
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:19.880]  You look at the international rates and you know, you've got Japan you've got
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:27.280]  Australia and you know, they've passed the their ban in Australia in 96. They haven't had a single massacre since in Japan
[02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:33.960]  Oh, yeah, now they're trying to take the bolt-action guns now there. Okay. Let me throw this at you long after leaded gas was out
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:39.140]  They did concealed carry and that's when the real drop started. So it's not the lead. That's a small part. I agree
[02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:43.200]  I've seen the studies. That's a small part from the complete rage of the 70s and 80s
[02:57:43.540 --> 02:57:47.400]  Okay, but but in the 90s, it's concealed carry more guns less crime
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:52.560]  You can use Japan where nobody robs each other when there's a tsunami and say look they have lower crime
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:55.420]  I mean, it's just it's a different culture is my point
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:58:02.120]  Look at Japan for one second. They they have in the ballpark of two to ten gun homicides
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:09.880]  Over the last six years or so. Okay per year, which is and and Japan is a smaller country than us, but
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:14.440]  They're significantly large and if a samurai told a villager to get on their knees
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:18.040]  Because they had disrespected him and to let them cut their head off
[02:58:18.040 --> 02:58:22.680]  They would not resist that has been a programming and the culture of feudal Japan
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:26.980]  They're great smart people, but that's leftovers of that the total submission
[02:58:27.760 --> 02:58:30.260]  And and and they don't have guns Alex
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:38.080]  But they got guys that go in schools and stab people with knives the government wants the guns to enslave us stay there back in
[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:40.080]  60 seconds
[02:58:40.080 --> 02:58:42.080]  Thank

[03:00:05.600 --> 03:00:07.280]  Big brother
[03:00:07.280 --> 03:00:09.000]  mainstream media
[03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.480]  Government cover-ups you want answers
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:17.520]  Well, so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:21.920]  And now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:29.300]  All right, it is our final little segment with jake huger of the young Turks calm to the kid radio TV host
[03:00:29.560 --> 03:00:31.560]  And star of YouTube with their news
[03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:38.080]  Pretty entertaining, but I don't agree with a lot of it. I mean, I'll say that up front because oh, it's an accident
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:40.080]  Oh, it's corrupt. Oh, whatever
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:47.200]  But at least the guy is not one of these Skeletor demons like the mainline Democrats are that I've met behind the scenes
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:52.360]  I mean, at least you'll admit that it's wrong that Obama. I mean, did you think that was sneaky how he said don't worry?
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:53.200]  I'm gonna veto
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:58.680]  NDAA so you don't have to fight it and then he blamed the Senate so they released the letters where his lawyers wrote it
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:02.000]  And Obama demanded it then he said don't worry. I won't sign it and he did
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:08.400]  I mean, it's the way Obama gets you to feel good when he walks you out behind the barn and slits your throat
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:10.400]  I mean, it's it's really creepy
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:16.960]  It is a great show or there was on stars called boss Kelsey Grammer was the star
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:19.880]  But I don't agree with Kelsey's politics, but damn he's brilliant
[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:24.120]  I thought he was the best actor on TV and there's a great line in there about politics
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:30.000]  They say the donors say we want change on the outside and continuity on the inside
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:33.120]  And that right there is Obama in a nutshell
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:37.280]  He sells you change and then he just keeps the machine rolling
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:43.360]  We give kind of wrestling nicknames to people sometimes Obama's nickname is the establishment
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:50.320]  and God, he does a brilliant job of pretending he's given you historic change while he
[03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:57.840]  Ups the ante honestly on the police state and the warrantless wiretapping and the NDAA. I don't know why he does it
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:00.780]  I mean, you know, I'm not a psychologist, but I do know he does do it
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:03.520]  Well, he's bought and paid for by the very same interest
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:08.080]  I mean we already went over that but I would just ask you to do this because I know you care about the children
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:13.920]  The vaccines in most cases like flu do not protect you from what it does on the insert
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:15.920]  It says it can kill you give you narcolepsy
[03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:18.960]  you name it and all over the world with the
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:25.440]  Meningitis and and other shots they're giving kids polio shots. It's killing them. I've got articles up at info wars calm right now
[03:02:25.440 --> 03:02:30.520]  Well, if I send you the actual studies and reports about vaccines killing kids
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:34.840]  Well, will the young Turks cover that or would you get kicked off the Al Jazeera TV?
[03:02:36.500 --> 03:02:39.000]  Well right now we don't have any deal with Al Jazeera
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:44.800]  I mean, I'm continuing on my old contract and I'm I've never been worried about getting kicked off of anything as you might know
[03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:48.560]  But but on the police, so will I read it? Of course. Will I cover it?
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:52.440]  I don't know. It depends on what's in it because you know, look, I don't know anything about it
[03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:57.880]  I'm not an expert on it, but every single doctor I know says that they believe in the vaccines
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:01.440]  They think a polio vaccine is enormously important before they've been brainwashed
[03:03:01.440 --> 03:03:05.240]  They've been brainwashed by it and they're told to do that by the medical companies
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:10.520]  They work for I have to know doctors that are pushed and given kickbacks for how many people they give shots
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:15.040]  Well in closing tell us about young Turks calm and now what you guys are going to be covering tonight
[03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:22.260]  So, you know, we do our live show 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock Eastern on the young Turks calm

[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:29.500]  Slash TYT and especially on youtube.com slash TYT. You got all the clips
[03:03:29.660 --> 03:03:34.180]  so if you like a story about guns or you like a story about the NDAA you will
[03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:40.700]  Be able to watch that in about five minutes and not necessarily have to watch the whole show and we do all the news
[03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:44.420]  So we got pop culture. We got policy really really serious
[03:03:44.940 --> 03:03:46.940]  politics foreign policy and
[03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:51.060]  We and then we've got a network of about 20 channels on YouTube as well
[03:03:51.060 --> 03:03:56.580]  So you can watch sports or any of the other topics that you like. So youtube.com slash TYT
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:04:02.940]  Yeah, you certainly pioneered things Glenn Beck's trying to copy what I've done, but also what you've done in closing
[03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:07.180]  Look, I know the New World Order is real. I've studied what they plan. It's a eugenics program
[03:04:07.180 --> 03:04:08.860]  Just like injecting black people with syphilis
[03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:14.300]  That's the tip of the iceberg and I'm telling you they're evil if you care about your children you have children, right?
[03:04:14.540 --> 03:04:19.160]  Yep, if you care about your children the GMO the top companies are on record
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:24.980]  It's designed to sterilize you if you care about your kids look into the vaccines if you care about what's happening
[03:04:24.980 --> 03:04:26.900]  I'm telling you. This is not my opinion
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:32.020]  The reason I get so upset jink is because I know this stuff's real and I think you might have a heart and a soul
[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:35.660]  So I'm asking you don't sell out to the New World Order
[03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:39.860]  You've shown you left MSNBC because you were against the war and stuff and the things they're doing
[03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:46.240]  Go all the way. You don't need the system come out against the New World Order. I'm telling you look into what I've covered
[03:04:46.240 --> 03:04:49.240]  It's real
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:55.120]  So far I disagree with you on that Alex, but I'm always open to reading things all right jink
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:57.240]  I'll say bye to you during the break. Thank you for spending so much time us
[03:04:57.240 --> 03:05:00.000]  We're gonna come back with a special report more on those statistics on the guns
[03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:09.600]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones myself my family the info wars dot-com team want to relay to you and your families that we are
[03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:17.520]  Intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front info wars dot-com is leading the fight against the technocrats
[03:05:17.840 --> 03:05:24.560]  But we can't do that without your help by getting the films bumper stickers and t-shirts and info wars
[03:05:24.640 --> 03:05:28.680]  Dot-com you will wake up people in your area and support our
[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:34.960]  Operation as we move to the next level we need your help to spread the word like never before
[03:05:34.960 --> 03:05:40.920]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:48.120]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics
[03:05:48.640 --> 03:05:50.640]  dehumanization and ultimate
[03:05:50.800 --> 03:05:55.920]  Extermination the war is here. It's an info war the spirit of
[03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.480]  1776 versus the mindset of
[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:04.560]  1984 my name is Stephen Huir after 22 years of nutritional counseling
[03:06:04.560 --> 03:06:09.760]  I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage
[03:06:09.760 --> 03:06:15.280]  So whether it is poor memory or focus lack of creative thinking or more serious matters like inability to focus
[03:06:15.480 --> 03:06:21.360]  Speak normally or remember things the emphasis to getting one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification
[03:06:21.520 --> 03:06:26.800]  One world way support your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production
[03:06:26.800 --> 03:06:31.640]  My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation
[03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:37.120]  I got him on one world way and in two months his constipation is gone. He's become friendlier
[03:06:37.120 --> 03:06:41.200]  He can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made his first friend
[03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:45.400]  He's doing great and he looks forward to taking one real way every day
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:52.400]  You could offer him a present or cake and he would prefer the one real way go to one world way calm
[03:06:52.400 --> 03:06:57.960]  That's one world WH e y.com or call eight eight eight nine eight eight three three two five

[03:07:04.240 --> 03:07:08.360]  Step outside the box. I want you to know some very important information in
[03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:13.720]  1985 president Ronald Reagan requested that carnivore be sent directly to the White House
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:18.120]  At a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer now
[03:07:18.120 --> 03:07:22.720]  Twenty seven years later carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy
[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:27.880]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17
[03:07:28.200 --> 03:07:35.600]  Naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell if you want to stay healthy
[03:07:35.920 --> 03:07:41.820]  Now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body

[03:07:59.980 --> 03:08:16.300]  He's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[03:08:16.300 --> 03:08:21.460]  All right, if you just joined us from the last hour we had Jake Uyghur of the Young Turks on
[03:08:21.980 --> 03:08:27.120]  And I don't think he's an evil person a bad person at heart like appears Morgan
[03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:29.320]  but
[03:08:29.320 --> 03:08:35.260]  he just makes excuses after the excuses after excuses and I was talking to Melissa Melton during the break and
[03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:41.140]  We were talking about how everybody's getting these allergies and they're getting worse and worse people that never had them are getting them to like
[03:08:41.380 --> 03:08:47.820]  Normal foods even stuff that isn't GMO and it's because we're being biologically manipulated and I have
[03:08:48.520 --> 03:08:54.880]  More than a hundred eugenics books written by the top scientists the heads of IBM the the White House science are
[03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:59.280]  How they would engineer this in the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:04.040]  We're gonna do some gun statistics here as we go into the fourth hour of overdrive with Melissa Melton
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:07.640]  But you were telling me a story and I said, well, can you tell that story on air?
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:13.520]  And you said yes, you would you had to take your son to the emergency room last night and I'm telling Jake
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:15.520]  I'm going listen. Don't give your kids vaccines
[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:19.600]  I'd like to send you the inserts and and listen this GMO was really designed and he's like
[03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:23.960]  I don't believe they want to do that to me. I'm like, what about black men and syphilis? What about the atomic soldiers?
[03:09:23.960 --> 03:09:26.960]  They're just not listening. Okay, there's a global scientific
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:29.840]  Dictatorship, it's a plan and
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:34.080]  99% of people are not in on it. It's a very small technocratic group
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:38.080]  But just like they have the times of London Bill Gates Oprah Winfrey
[03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:42.760]  Warren Buffett Soros about 30 of them met at
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:49.920]  Rockefeller University quote secret meeting to discuss global government to reduce our population that it's always the same
[03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:55.360]  I mean when I say I've read a hundred books, okay, I'm not exaggerating a hundred books
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:10:01.080]  They've read it's more than a hundred where they admit their global government plan where they admit they're killing us
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:06.840]  cancer is I mean that that Miss America contestants having both her breasts removed and
[03:10:08.720 --> 03:10:13.840]  She's wondering why her mother and all her family's dying of breast cancer. Why is breast cancer up 3,000 something percent?
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:18.560]  Why is the u.s. Leading it worldwide in the increase? There's never discussion. Why is it exploding?
[03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:22.760]  Why is it exploding? Why are all these other autism all these other cancers?
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:28.880]  Why why why why why why why but you give your kid a vaccine they have a convulsion right there now the doctors are taught
[03:10:28.880 --> 03:10:33.440]  This is in the news to say that's normal to have a convulsion really and your two-year-old never talks again
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:39.320]  Now and again, it's around 18 months to two years when they all build up the 50-something vaccines now
[03:10:39.320 --> 03:10:42.560]  it's gonna be a hundred and then 200 they're talking about by age two and
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:46.280]  Yeah, let's turn her mic on go ahead and say what you said again
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:50.400]  Oh, the u.s. Has the most aggressive vaccine schedule in the world. It's unprecedented
[03:10:50.520 --> 03:10:56.080]  We have so many vaccines that are given and it is amazing. I think it's like 69 by 18
[03:10:56.320 --> 03:10:58.320]  You're supposed to take now 50 something by two
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:10:58.960]  Yeah
[03:10:58.960 --> 03:11:00.120]  It just keeps going up
[03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:03.520]  So and they just keep adding more and Bill Gates is funding putting it in the food
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:10.160]  Pears and bananas where you you're gonna take and mosquitoes that come bite you you don't have a choice Bill Gates says he even has
[03:11:10.160 --> 03:11:14.760]  A clothing thing now that's gonna have nanotech in it. That's gonna dispense medication. Oh, that doesn't sound like it's dangerous
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:20.760]  Yeah, that sounds great. No, everything's fine. There's not a plan. You know, the globalists just took over and are launching drones
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:27.240]  They admit humans won't even be in the equation soon. Only the elite let's build giant robot armies for eugenics-based elite
[03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:30.900]  That sounds wonderful. Yes, and then we'll all wear their Medicaid tell folks what happened to your son
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:36.040]  My ex decided to take him to a well-known fast-food restaurant and get him say the name Burger King
[03:11:36.040 --> 03:11:41.400]  It was Burger King and get him some onion rings and within probably 20 minutes of eating these onion rings his whole body just
[03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:48.200]  welled up with huge rashes and blisters and he had to go to the emergency room because his eyes were swelling shut a
[03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:55.920]  Couple years ago, we'd be on a road trip and you know now we always pack all our food period period and find out
[03:11:55.920 --> 03:11:57.920]  We're you know, at least semi-organic
[03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:01.280]  Store is somewhere around there or we pack it all on a road trip
[03:12:01.960 --> 03:12:04.580]  Because every time I give in all right
[03:12:04.580 --> 03:12:08.800]  I guess we'll pull into one of the big names my children get sick and act like demons
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:13.480]  Mm-hmm. And the thing is it's been shown to be addictive because McDonald's and others by law
[03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:18.960]  They call it an additive. It has silicone and a lot of the frying agents says I mean silicone silicone
[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:24.320]  And then high fructose corn syrup and everything too and it's just the whole combination of all those chemicals all at once hitting a small
[03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:29.760]  Child, it's just amazing. But yeah, I've never I mean even when we've ever gone there
[03:12:29.760 --> 03:12:30.520]  I mean we eat it
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:32.440]  We always feel crappy like you said
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:36.920]  But this is the first time this has ever happened and I we will not be eating there ever again
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:40.860]  I mean it was scary. It really scared me. They thought his throat might swell shut
[03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:43.960]  They had to give him two medications and the hospital said it was an allergic reaction
[03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:49.120]  It was an allergic reaction and that was the only thing that he'd ingested or any and again 20 years ago
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:53.520]  There might have been one or two food allergies. Now. It's hundreds of things eat a mango die
[03:12:54.240 --> 03:12:58.000]  One in five Americans are allergic to wheat. They have wheat gluten issues now
[03:12:58.320 --> 03:13:03.760]  And again didn't used to be the case my grandmother almost nine never had allergies has horrible ones always lived here
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:07.720]  It's everybody I know I mean listen, I've been exercising
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:12.000]  I've been eating almost no GMO really working hard to do this up when I'm on the road then it's hard
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:12.960]  It's a habit
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:17.480]  I have been swimming two miles a day back when I could still go swimming for it was too cold
[03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:21.360]  Jogging hiking climbing mountains my muscles get bigger and stuff
[03:13:21.360 --> 03:13:27.480]  But I've got allergies now to cedar where I may have to leave in the winter and go remote do the show from another city
[03:13:27.480 --> 03:13:31.280]  I mean, I'm actually looking at it and nothing will get rid of it. I just gnashed my teeth together
[03:13:31.280 --> 03:13:35.800]  I'm so angry about it so bad. I mean I mean this whole thing is out of control Melissa
[03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:38.480]  Well, and then when you go you have all these random symptoms
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:43.120]  And they want to give you more and more medications and tell you you have more and more disorders and not tell you what it
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:44.480]  actually is
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:47.000]  Well, I mean the doctors don't know they're not specialists
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:52.600]  But the endocrinologist the allergist the the the the scientists that study the brain blood barrier
[03:13:52.960 --> 03:13:56.000]  Dr. Blaylock all of them will tell you this stuff is killing us
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:59.560]  I mean listen take all the different BT varieties of corn and stuff
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:04.720]  There's a bunch of companies put it out on just Monsanto it all is designed where when bugs eat it they die
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:08.360]  They die, but they say but it's safe for you to excuse me, and they go well. It's natural
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:12.740]  They took a fungus or in one case of bacteria and soup it up thousands of times
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:20.000]  The the poisonous bacteria or fungus and then it's two different varieties, and then we're supposed to eat that everything's fine
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:24.440]  Don't matter all the bowel diseases are exploding does it matter your IQs are dropping doesn't matter
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:28.800]  You're getting cancer doesn't matter of the studies that killed all the monkeys and rats everything's fine, Melissa
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:32.160]  Everything's okay tune into the Young Turks man the government loves us
[03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:37.440]  Yeah, why wouldn't you want to eat a food that produces its own pesticide that sounds great. That's healthy for everyone
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:44.080]  I actually read one of the people from the American Academy of Pediatrics said that there's no long-term study to show that eating less
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:45.600]  Pesticide is healthier for you
[03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:48.880]  So if there's no long-term study to tell you that it's bad for you
[03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:51.800]  Then that means it must be good for them, and they don't do the human studies
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:58.840]  But then they do the monkeys the guinea pigs the rats the mice within three generations with with multiple new
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:05.980]  GMO potatoes you name it the rats are almost all sterile or mentally retarded or dead or have giant cancers or no
[03:15:05.980 --> 03:15:10.460]  Genitals or genitals on their head. I mean it is stuff you can't it isn't and it's all
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:15.240]  All these companies Monsanto on the board of McDonald's tied into Bill and Melinda Gates
[03:15:15.400 --> 03:15:16.800]  Bill Gates bought into Monsanto
[03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:22.600]  And then you go track the founders and the heads all eugenicist all going and giving speeches how they want to kill us
[03:15:23.160 --> 03:15:25.040]  Exactly Bill Gates gets up at TED TV
[03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:31.600]  We've got to lower this h2o equation from the humans down to zero that means zero this shows zero humans and the whole crowd laughs
[03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:33.600]  and gets off
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:40.100]  Knowing they're in on the joke that thrills them as little control freaks
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:45.160]  Because they don't like going to the Grand Canyon and seeing you see zero right there on screen
[03:15:45.160 --> 03:15:47.160]  Now the numbers up to 80
[03:15:47.900 --> 03:15:53.980]  European children develop narcolepsy of receiving h1n1 vaccine, and then you go back boom Bill Gates
[03:15:53.980 --> 03:15:59.940]  It was 60 something thousand India got sterilized 50 African children paralyzed after receiving Bill Gates
[03:16:00.460 --> 03:16:04.140]  Back to meningitis vaccine. Oh, but everything's fine
[03:16:04.620 --> 03:16:09.180]  Everything's good isn't that just precious Melissa. Yeah, when you look into his foundation
[03:16:09.180 --> 03:16:15.460]  They own stock in all the companies Monsanto McDonald's Burger King big he owned and then he owns stock in the pioneering companies who treat
[03:16:15.540 --> 03:16:18.740]  Autism and treat gut disorders, so they hit it on both sides
[03:16:19.060 --> 03:16:24.020]  They're gonna suck the money out of you while you're debilitated and tortured so they don't want to just kill you
[03:16:24.060 --> 03:16:27.660]  It's important to watch humanity mutate and die and be in pain
[03:16:28.060 --> 03:16:31.820]  Because I mean that's why Joe Biden talks about those beautiful children riddled with holes
[03:16:33.180 --> 03:16:38.060]  Have you seen that where he's like obviously getting off on it. I mean anyone can look and go perv
[03:16:38.060 --> 03:16:43.100]  Perv perv. I saw him in a park. I would creep away from him. Yeah
[03:16:43.100 --> 03:16:44.860]  I wouldn't want to go down a dark alley with that guy
[03:16:44.860 --> 03:16:48.740]  I haven't seen that particular clip, but I can barely watch it. I mean it's so hard to even see you guys
[03:16:48.740 --> 03:16:50.740]  Have the Joe Biden I sent you
[03:16:51.300 --> 03:16:53.540]  Cue it up. This is just part of it all right
[03:16:53.540 --> 03:16:56.660]  And we're gonna go to break and cover the statistics in the five minutes after that
[03:16:56.820 --> 03:17:02.860]  You know we were giving those statistics most the drop was not in the 80s. No. It's consistently over the last 20 years
[03:17:03.060 --> 03:17:07.460]  Yeah, and I phased the lead out starting like 180 to 86 or so the lead study
[03:17:07.460 --> 03:17:09.340]  Yeah, but that can't be accounted for it
[03:17:09.340 --> 03:17:14.940]  Just continually dropping for the last it accelerated the last nine with the proliferation of concealed carry
[03:17:14.940 --> 03:17:18.180]  And they have the local we took stats in college
[03:17:18.540 --> 03:17:23.740]  Yeah, I mean to say that that's all it is is just I think there's no way you can do that when you look at
[03:17:23.740 --> 03:17:25.780]  The whole big picture of all of well they can't stand it
[03:17:25.780 --> 03:17:28.420]  They're like look at the children like Stalin said one person dies
[03:17:28.420 --> 03:17:33.420]  It's a tragedy a million die or 10,000 die different quote its statistics
[03:17:33.420 --> 03:17:38.900]  They know that I mean they got drones murdering blowing kids lower mandibles off hell-raiser type stuff
[03:17:38.900 --> 03:17:43.420]  It's all cute and funny, but then all the children give us your guns. It's for the Obama
[03:17:43.420 --> 03:17:49.100]  I'll get the guns for you the little kid high-five me. I mean the exploitiveness of it well
[03:17:49.100 --> 03:17:53.260]  He's killing hundreds of kids in other countries. That's fine. No one cares about that. We have the perv Club
[03:17:54.980 --> 03:17:57.440]  Okay play the perv here's the pervert different meetings
[03:17:57.440 --> 03:18:03.480]  There is nothing that has gone to the heart of the matter more than
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:07.840]  The visual image people have a little curve next to his riddle
[03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:10.760]  Not shot in the street
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:18.760]  Riddle and one of the guys in that meeting son planned a mass shooting the local cops stopped see how this works
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:25.280]  It's like he's salivating over the word riddle. He don't know he has that look

[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:25.920]  Did you see him during the speech with Obama last week the salivating and the he kept fighting the small going?
[03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:27.920]  I
[03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:34.280]  Gotta feed the trolls here on here when I do these little pieces they take it out of context
[03:19:34.760 --> 03:19:37.860]  They've got it clipped together and dubbed my voice saying racist stuff, too
[03:19:37.860 --> 03:19:42.300]  Oh wonderful, but it doesn't all it does is just credit them. Basically. It's a good way to spend your time

[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:12.440]  I just looked at some of the statistics
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:15.160]  21% drop in violent crime the last seven years
[03:24:16.160 --> 03:24:20.720]  And then I saw Fox say 49, but they didn't give the actual proof. I went looked it up
[03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:22.720]  They were being accurate 49 plus
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:31.200]  Percent since 1991 Melissa Melton's here to cover that that'll hit a few of the headlines up at info wars.com for TV viewers
[03:24:31.200 --> 03:24:33.200]  We're putting graphics up
[03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:37.080]  Showing from FBI.gov and then we break down the numbers and again
[03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:39.200]  This is what you went to college for along with journalism
[03:24:39.200 --> 03:24:42.240]  So you've been helping us crack these numbers, but anybody can go check them for themselves
[03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:45.120]  And then some will say I thought you don't like government numbers
[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:48.620]  We know which ones are fake from economists and others like the unemployment numbers
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:53.460]  Or numbers on inflation they used to be accurate 20 years ago, and they've gotten worse and worse
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:58.580]  So we know how they cook them the crime statistics are very accurate as they're compiled locally
[03:24:58.580 --> 03:25:02.460]  And then they're cross referenced by a lot of different universities and others
[03:25:02.460 --> 03:25:07.180]  But the uniform crime statistics go over these for people well these statistics come from
[03:25:07.820 --> 03:25:12.600]  18,000 law enforcement agencies across the whole country and you're talking City College County State
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:20.560]  Tribal federal agencies all over so 18,000 they compile this data every single year, and they've been putting it up as from court records
[03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:27.400]  It's all filed the arrest that what was reported to the FBI their reporting system that they've had for many decades
[03:25:27.400 --> 03:25:29.920]  So you got 18,000 groups that can cross-check their info
[03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:32.080]  It's been found to be some of the most accurate numbers out there
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:37.120]  Everybody uses this is our most consistent crime data that we have in this country it comes from these numbers in fact
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:41.760]  Do they do anything they've been caught inflating it to get money, so it's probably even lower than what they're saying but go over it
[03:25:41.760 --> 03:25:47.920]  Well, okay, so what they have up right now is is from 1992 and if you use the basic calculation for percentages
[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:55.560]  You'll see that violent crime will start with that has been cut in half since 1992 the 1992 violent crime rate per 100,000 people was
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:02.480]  757.7 if you subtract the 2011 violent crime rate that's 386.3 you get 371.4
[03:26:02.480 --> 03:26:06.560]  You divide this by your original 1992 rate that gives you 0.49
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:13.340]  Oh to multiply that out to find your percentage, and you're gonna have a decrease of forty nine point zero two percent in violent crime between
[03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:15.180]  1992 and
[03:26:15.180 --> 03:26:22.920]  2011 incredible and the murder rate shows the actually the same decrease from 1992 to 2011 in 1992 the rate was
[03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:24.440]  9.3 in
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:30.820]  2011 it fell to 4.7 if you subtract you get 4.6 divide that by your 1992 base rate and again you get a
[03:26:30.820 --> 03:26:38.380]  49% decrease in murder rates in this country from 1992 to 2011 so it's cut in half we have half and
[03:26:39.180 --> 03:26:41.940]  Actually all the major crime categories that the FBI does
[03:26:43.460 --> 03:26:47.820]  Collects all this data for have dropped significantly between 1992 and 2011
[03:26:48.540 --> 03:26:49.940]  As you can see here
[03:26:49.940 --> 03:26:57.580]  I've got all the numbers up there every single one of those numbers has dropped every single one every one the only crime statistics
[03:26:57.580 --> 03:27:01.180]  We see another report on this is the petty crime because criminals are afraid to home invade
[03:27:01.420 --> 03:27:04.220]  Karjak now or knock a woman on the head and that was just
[03:27:04.860 --> 03:27:08.220]  Prolific decades ago because they're scared of getting blown away now you look at
[03:27:08.460 --> 03:27:11.900]  What you ought to do in the next few days is do this versus British crime rates
[03:27:11.900 --> 03:27:18.140]  They've got those numbers just the muggings the stabbings are just off of the charts a much higher rate of rape there than we do
[03:27:18.140 --> 03:27:22.940]  Here also their rape is going off the charts. I mean a lot of their stuff their violent crime is going off the charts
[03:27:22.940 --> 03:27:26.340]  It's much they estimate many states a third of women are packing heat in their purse
[03:27:26.340 --> 03:27:28.220]  You're gonna try to rape her in the parking garage
[03:27:28.220 --> 03:27:29.260]  Well, they're there
[03:27:29.260 --> 03:27:35.940]  They've calling Britain the violent crime capital of the UK because it's higher their rates are higher for violent crime than I believe
[03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:40.860]  Australia South Africa here and Canada so we cover all the statistics
[03:27:41.060 --> 03:27:44.980]  Yeah, that's and that's all the the graphics that I have here all these different statistics
[03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:50.520]  But I mean all of these are consistently down every single thing is consistently down anybody can go they can get these reports
[03:27:50.520 --> 03:27:53.380]  They can see they've put them up every year for the last 20 years
[03:27:53.380 --> 03:27:57.980]  So they can go to the FBI they can download all of it. They can download it for their state
[03:27:57.980 --> 03:28:03.020]  They can look at all of this different information right down, and then you can double-check. Let's say you live in
[03:28:03.980 --> 03:28:09.540]  Fresno, California, or let's say you live in get your specific city, and you can clear water, Florida
[03:28:09.540 --> 03:28:13.060]  You can go check those numbers check it with the newspapers 20 years
[03:28:13.060 --> 03:28:19.020]  You can look at that and they do this every single year and like I said this is used every time a criminal justice study
[03:28:19.020 --> 03:28:21.040]  Is done it's pretty much used every class
[03:28:21.040 --> 03:28:26.860]  I had in grad school we use this data because this is the most consistent data that we have and some people like to detract
[03:28:26.860 --> 03:28:32.220]  And argue about this data and say well it crime is underreported, but if anything I would say
[03:28:32.820 --> 03:28:37.840]  This is the bit was underreported them, and there are obviously some unreported crimes, but that's a constant
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:39.940]  Yeah in the pool a lot of statistics
[03:28:39.940 --> 03:28:41.740]  I've read of show it's more reported now
[03:28:41.740 --> 03:28:45.820]  It's easier to report as the internet or report and they let you do it with anonymity which is
[03:28:46.020 --> 03:28:51.020]  unconstitutional in the past you had to go face your accuser right and over the years the FBI has made their system of
[03:28:51.020 --> 03:28:56.060]  Reporting from these local agencies easier for them to report their data as well and have a much more consistent
[03:28:56.060 --> 03:28:59.220]  Well everybody knows there's less crime when I was growing up in Dallas
[03:28:59.220 --> 03:29:02.140]  I remember some weeks when they were like 60 something dead
[03:29:02.700 --> 03:29:07.240]  And because you know in the 60s and 70s everything got real anti-gun and gunnership went way down
[03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:11.140]  They were winning their war body was getting rid of their guns crime exploded all over
[03:29:11.140 --> 03:29:16.660]  But then guns came back and criminals are scared, but any police will tell you that I mean look
[03:29:16.660 --> 03:29:19.480]  You come you you home invade in Texas. You're probably gonna die
[03:29:19.480 --> 03:29:23.480]  Yeah, I mean I've read I read a statistic say and I didn't bring this one in here with me
[03:29:23.480 --> 03:29:28.080]  But assault weapons are only used in what 0.6% of all murders
[03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:31.680]  I know and I kept trying to tell it's kind of kept trying to tell pierce morgan
