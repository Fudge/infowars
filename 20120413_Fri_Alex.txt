[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:42.920]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is Friday
[00:42.920 --> 00:51.400]  the 13th day I just realized it's Friday the 13th seems like just last week we had a Friday the
[00:51.400 --> 00:57.080]  13th but I guess that was last year and it's a fitting Friday the 13th as we go into the weekend
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.960]  and you have the tribute that's paid yearly to the private collection agency that's governmental
[01:02.960 --> 01:09.880]  power but it collects money for the private Federal Reserve so the collection agency for the
[01:09.880 --> 01:16.480]  private Federal Reserve none of the money goes to run the country it goes to siphon off the
[01:16.480 --> 01:23.520]  economy to the foreign mega banks and to pay for the interest that we pay the private banks to be
[01:23.520 --> 01:36.840]  able to even have money notice that money in your wallet says Federal Reserve note not US note
[01:36.840 --> 01:47.000]  and in that is the heart of the globalist total control over society at least the level of economics
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.920]  and they're trying to mop up the few little areas of resistance now anybody with their own
[01:54.920 --> 02:03.200]  swap meat or garage sale or selling vegetables or fruits on the side of the street it is really
[02:03.200 --> 02:11.600]  amazing to watch the environmental police fanning out harassing the population we're gonna have open
[02:11.600 --> 02:19.520]  phones today open phones throughout the full three hours and so I will give you the toll free
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.720]  number to join us after the break and you are welcome to encourage to join us on any of the
[02:24.720 --> 02:31.880]  issues that are out there on any of the different big developments that are unfolding and I will
[02:31.880 --> 02:40.440]  briefly get into some of those big stories on the other side the Washington Post and the Daily
[02:40.440 --> 02:49.680]  Mail and others are reporting that Viking robot found live on Mars in 1976 they've now tested what
[02:49.680 --> 02:57.800]  they believe were bacteria for the last three decades I guess it's 36 years technically and they
[02:57.800 --> 03:05.240]  are now saying they're 99% sure that it is primitive bacteria now the problem is this is
[03:05.240 --> 03:12.120]  coming from a government that has been caught lying so much you can't believe a word comes out
[03:12.120 --> 03:17.920]  of their mouth this could be fiction like bar zoom you know the guy that wrote the Tarzan
[03:17.920 --> 03:29.440]  king of the apes books also wrote the John Carter books and other really good fiction and is this
[03:29.440 --> 03:38.840]  just more fiction or are there floating cities on bar zoom undoubtedly Mars has water it has a
[03:38.840 --> 03:46.680]  northern southern ice cap and undoubtedly Martian rocks do rain down on the earth that when larger
[03:46.680 --> 03:54.560]  meteors hit Mars and a lot of scientists believe in the theory of space seating for life that's
[03:54.560 --> 04:01.800]  what my little video piece secrets of Prometheus leaked is about it's about the elite believing
[04:01.800 --> 04:06.760]  that space aliens or gods created the planet doesn't mean I believe that I'm saying that's
[04:06.760 --> 04:13.880]  what the Illuminati's deepest belief is that's why I made that video that has 400,000 views
[04:13.880 --> 04:18.320]  that we also aired to 3 million listeners and viewers here on the radio show but if you missed
[04:18.320 --> 04:25.520]  it it's one of the better research pieces we've done Aaron put about a week's work of work into
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.760]  it and it is out there for everybody to see but we'll be talking about that also record
[04:31.760 --> 04:38.560]  numbers of earthquakes taking place I'm gonna break that down early in the hour a gold resume
[04:38.560 --> 04:47.400]  surge as new QE rumor is back North Korea the Stalin estate couldn't get their precious little
[04:47.400 --> 04:52.680]  rocket they're trying to menace everyone off the ground with a child dictator piece of trash over
[04:52.680 --> 04:58.720]  there more government scum I'm supposed to worship he's got a fancy hat with badges I mean I need to
[04:58.720 --> 05:04.880]  bow down to him I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting

[05:10.080 --> 05:16.000]  trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.980]  what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at

[08:37.080 --> 08:43.920]  we're going to be live here for the next three hours I will be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[08:43.920 --> 08:51.920]  central standard time with a live Sunday transmission also I got to say it the investigative
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.080]  reports that my crew is putting together for the radio and for the nightly news everything
[08:57.080 --> 09:03.840]  we're doing our team on the ground in Georgia with the suspicious death under agenda 21 in the
[09:03.840 --> 09:14.320]  seizure of homes for a green space using zoning to harass people into oblivion is wild our crew
[09:14.320 --> 09:20.360]  tried to go in the city council peacefully public building marked as public and were told by police
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.400]  they couldn't go in and they are back there today demanding to see the law that someone in a
[09:26.400 --> 09:32.400]  uniform just says you can't enter the city council to try to go to some of the offices and attempt
[09:32.400 --> 09:38.160]  to talk to people and I see this all over the country now I saw it with the Federal Reserve
[09:38.160 --> 09:45.800]  a few years ago in Kansas City I had sent Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson to Kansas City to interview
[09:45.800 --> 09:54.400]  William K. Black the former you know top federal regulator of the SNL scandals who sent a bunch
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.600]  people to prison we were there to interview Professor Black and they're driving they had a taxi cab
[09:59.600 --> 10:05.960]  taking them around back to the airport and they noticed the Federal Reserve building and they
[10:05.960 --> 10:11.360]  said let's pull over and get some b-roll and so they decide about a half mile away we've shown
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.800]  you the Google Maps on air to go to the World War One Memorial and shoot some footage of that and
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.880]  they're up on the parapet area it's built like a castle they're at the World War One Memorial the
[10:20.880 --> 10:29.720]  National World War One Memorial it's in Kansas City and they're shooting the video of the Federal
[10:29.720 --> 10:37.320]  Reserve on federal property well private property but claiming it's federal far away totally separate
[10:37.320 --> 10:44.640]  from the city park and here come security guards posing as federal law enforcement with firearms
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.320]  and they demanded to see their ID they said I don't have to show it to you they put their hands
[10:50.320 --> 10:55.480]  on their guns they say you better I can have a citizen's arrest well of course the security guard
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.640]  has a citizen's arrest power you have a citizen's arrest power and quite frankly and by the way
[11:01.640 --> 11:06.640]  this is already on the books they're making a big deal in Indiana about the governor you know
[11:06.640 --> 11:15.120]  supporting or the legislature you know passing a bill where you can resist a police officer who
[11:15.120 --> 11:23.680]  is engaged in unlawful activity with lethal force you don't need to pass a law to say that
[11:23.680 --> 11:29.040]  that's already on the books in every state we've got constitutional lawyers on to go over that
[11:29.040 --> 11:38.080]  it's just like when the state of Texas tried to pass a law saying the TSA can't grope people's
[11:38.080 --> 11:47.960]  children or adults and if you touch the genitals it is a felony well it's already a felony they're
[11:47.960 --> 11:56.680]  not even sworn peace officers if a peace officer did that they would go to jail if there wasn't
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.600]  probable cause or emergency situation that is the essence of martial law when the normal
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.040]  constitution is suspended and that's what they've done is a soft suspension the Bill of Rights
[12:06.040 --> 12:12.080]  and Constitution but I'm digressing the point is that there's already laws against doing that to
[12:12.080 --> 12:17.320]  people that's why courthouses all over the country that put in naked body scanners lawyers have
[12:17.320 --> 12:23.360]  pointed out and in Colorado and in Florida other places hey it's pedophilia for you to do this to
[12:23.360 --> 12:29.840]  under 18 you could try to make an adult consent to go into the public building and even that's
[12:29.840 --> 12:35.040]  unconstitutional but you better stop you know the state attorneys and others told them do not
[12:35.040 --> 12:43.440]  touch the genitals do not touch it on the outside of the inside of under 18s do not do it and that
[12:43.440 --> 12:48.440]  was in the Denver Post last year and it's also been in the Miami Herald that in Florida and
[12:48.440 --> 12:53.160]  Colorado they've stopped doing that because because they understand it's illegal I mean just
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.080]  because somebody's in a uniform and they show up and pull a gun out and say they're gonna kill you
[12:57.080 --> 13:06.720]  you have a right to defend yourself and that's the essence of tyranny when people just say I have a
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.840]  uniform or I'm from the government you must do what I say and there are my reporters polite
[13:11.840 --> 13:19.080]  Darren McBree in a suit very gentlemanly Marcos very gentlemanly very polite and they're walking
[13:19.080 --> 13:25.840]  up to the city council building and three cop cars pull up jump out get in their face and say
[13:25.840 --> 13:33.880]  you're not going in there they say you're not and they and by the way turn your cameras off
[13:33.880 --> 13:40.360]  and and my reporters said no to that but the point is well where's the law officer you see
[13:40.360 --> 13:48.720]  police will arrest you they say for not following an officer's order it's a lawful order and and
[13:48.720 --> 14:07.280]  a lawful order is you are recklessly driving pull over all of these laws pulling you over are done
[14:07.280 --> 14:16.080]  in the name of an emergency but the essence of what's wrong with our country and what's brought
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.880]  every other country that's gone into tyranny to its knees and into all the horrors that come
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.720]  with tyranny and oppression and despotism and out of control government it's people just saying
[14:25.720 --> 14:35.960]  I've got a uniform and a badge or I'm a bureaucrat and I say you can't enter the building and then
[14:35.960 --> 14:42.560]  you're faced with people with guns who are doing something that is illegal they are blocking your
[14:42.560 --> 14:56.600]  access to a public building they are blocking the press they are blocking you from your basic
[14:56.600 --> 15:02.160]  rights and it is outrageous and they're so comfortable with it and the police officers say
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.320]  to my crew and they have it all on tape we're gonna get back tonight and we'll have it for you on
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.560]  Monday you know the high death we had some live feeds the Skype on the ground of some of this
[15:10.560 --> 15:24.120]  yesterday on air and and and there are my reporters having to confront officers who
[15:24.120 --> 15:30.560]  say on tape I'm just following orders like it's okay so so there's some city council people who
[15:30.560 --> 15:35.880]  don't want the media coming in so that you can get that 60 minutes moment where you walk in and
[15:35.880 --> 15:41.680]  say we'd like to talk to the mayor we'd like to talk to the head of city zoning we'd like
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.400]  documents on this agenda 21 land you were trying to take that's what they say in the
[15:46.400 --> 15:52.280]  documents we'd like to talk about it and to have them say no we're not talking to you or we'd like
[15:52.280 --> 15:56.280]  to go in and see the city records which are supposed to do by law you know we'd like to go
[15:56.280 --> 16:03.680]  in and do a records request and they say no well you might as well be in North Korea where
[16:03.680 --> 16:10.320]  the third generational dictator wears a little uniform I mean he's a guy that reportedly lays
[16:10.320 --> 16:16.200]  around all day and watches television and couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag and and you
[16:16.200 --> 16:21.000]  know went to school in Switzerland and he just arrives and is the supreme ruler as his whole
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.400]  country collapses and they can't even get a 1950s era rocket off the ground as the to show off and
[16:27.400 --> 16:33.640]  menace everyone to end up threatening to get more international aid and money and they are now
[16:33.640 --> 16:39.600]  threatening to detonate an atomic bomb to show everybody how powerful the new leader is I mean
[16:39.600 --> 16:48.840]  that's all government is it's an exercise of power when the TSA sticks their hands down your
[16:48.840 --> 16:54.880]  pants which they do when they grow up your daughter in front of you it's an exercise of raw power
[16:54.880 --> 17:02.160]  just like that pathetic scumbag I mean I was looking at photos that North Korea itself was
[17:02.160 --> 17:07.400]  released of just the little kids they call them orphanages and they just put them in beds to starve
[17:07.400 --> 17:15.360]  to death that's what the state delivers absolute hell on earth and it's now delivering it here in
[17:15.360 --> 17:28.920]  my country agenda 21 is in control to a great extent of the town I live in I'm under UN regulations
[17:28.920 --> 17:36.920]  they admit it's UN regulations the public schools are under UNESCO UN regulations even private
[17:36.920 --> 17:43.080]  schools that are accredited give their children packets telling you how wonderful Michelle Obama
[17:43.080 --> 17:47.960]  is and how she cares about you and how she's going to tell you what to eat and you're not supposed
[17:47.960 --> 17:54.560]  to have the dear leader's wife in propaganda to your kids this is this is all the trappings of a
[17:54.560 --> 18:03.240]  country hurtling into despotism and we're in a depression the economy is slowly shutting down
[18:03.240 --> 18:08.440]  they're devaluing the currency all of this is happening now I'm going to do something I'm going
[18:08.440 --> 18:13.200]  to open the phones up first for the rest of the hour and then in the second hour I will begin
[18:13.200 --> 18:19.640]  getting into the massive news US troops to have supervision as Pentagon orders electronic contact
[18:19.640 --> 18:25.000]  lenses that let them see through drones flying overhead that's going to be the cybernetic system
[18:25.000 --> 18:34.960]  I'm going to talk about that radar online radar magazine makes fun of conservative groups that
[18:34.960 --> 18:40.800]  don't like a new HBO show that shows children doing things that I won't even post on my website
[18:40.800 --> 18:49.000]  even though it's news it is five-year-old girls performing artificial oral sex on giant sex toys
[18:49.000 --> 18:59.280]  see how they push the line on you and people like what's the point of that it's all psychological
[18:59.280 --> 19:04.360]  warfare that's what the TSA is doing this to your children's about that's what this is about
[19:04.360 --> 19:11.560]  that's what all of violence it's all meant on record to stunt your conscience to stunt your
[19:11.560 --> 19:18.040]  your mind where you don't recognize corruption anymore I mean they come out in the news and
[19:18.040 --> 19:21.960]  they give children vaccines without parental consent now totally illegal they just do it
[19:21.960 --> 19:26.840]  California actually passes a law saying they can do it it's still illegal that's the law
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.560]  saying blacks or slaves still illegal I say it's a fraud those against common sense and common law
[19:31.560 --> 19:36.280]  they take your children not for not having vaccines there's no law they just do it this one I mean
[19:36.280 --> 19:42.320]  it's a lawlessness and I was on drugs today looking at the radar article I linked over to it and I
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.680]  told my webmasters I said you know I don't even want to link to this but I guess I'm gonna tell
[19:46.680 --> 19:51.360]  Curtax you write an article about it I mean I was looking at this stuff and I was like really
[19:51.360 --> 20:01.520]  this is the promos running on HBO five and six year old girls I just you don't need me
[20:01.520 --> 20:08.240]  to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis everyone can feel it we know a tectonic struggle
[20:08.240 --> 20:13.960]  is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness bondage
[20:13.960 --> 20:21.680]  and enslavement yes my friends evil is rising but take heart for every action there is an
[20:21.680 --> 20:27.240]  equal and opposite reaction recently new world order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're
[20:27.240 --> 20:33.920]  losing the info war we are in an information war and we are losing that war the globalist are

[24:52.680 --> 24:58.520]  like it's okay I mean let me tell you when I was flying back from Las Vegas from doing a video shoot

[26:16.280 --> 26:17.560]  in the long segment coming up
[26:22.360 --> 26:30.040]  because I digress seeing her little daughter in here so innocent and I think about how innocent
[26:30.040 --> 26:37.080]  my children are and how I have to keep them away from television even you know Christian friends
[26:37.080 --> 26:41.640]  and people I can't really send them over to be at people's houses if they watch television at all
[26:41.640 --> 26:46.520]  because of what's on it I can't even really let them go to my parents and watch a football game
[26:46.520 --> 26:51.400]  because of the ads you're like oh come on it's not a big deal my parents aren't but other people are
[26:51.400 --> 26:57.000]  like I can't be in a pizza place with my children with the TV on with the stuff that's there now
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.040]  HBO is coming out with a prime time show called Angry Boys
[27:08.440 --> 27:19.080]  that shows little girls who are so innocent and so good with giant sex toys sucking on them
[27:19.080 --> 27:27.000]  I mean what else am I supposed to say this is what they put on television
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  it shows giant cups of the shapes of men's genitals and and and this is what they do
[27:35.720 --> 27:42.840]  and I can't even get into the rest of it here on air it gets worse on adult radio I and it's
[27:42.840 --> 27:49.240]  such a crime this is attacking innocence that's what the sex ad is they're not trying to teach
[27:49.240 --> 27:52.920]  in public schools worldwide under UN standardization it's all UNESCO it's the same from
[27:52.920 --> 27:57.560]  Australia to the US from Germany to Denmark it's global standardization
[27:59.320 --> 28:03.480]  they don't teach you hey if you have sex you can catch these diseases like they tell you they do
[28:03.480 --> 28:12.680]  no it was all about how to have sex and I'll tell you when I was sitting there in in in middle
[28:12.680 --> 28:18.200]  school with sex education all it was making me do is look over at the girl next to me and her look
[28:18.200 --> 28:25.480]  over at me all it was doing was sexualizing and destroying innocence of people in the sixth grade
[28:26.120 --> 28:30.680]  but now they've got it down to first graders and it's all been covered and they say oh you're
[28:30.680 --> 28:36.280]  just being homophobic hey I don't care if it was homosexual heterosexual whatever it is you don't
[28:36.280 --> 28:45.320]  teach children period five six seven-year-olds Heather has two mommies you know Billy has two
[28:45.320 --> 28:49.720]  daddies all this this is what they teach children and then they teach them stuff that I didn't even
[28:49.720 --> 28:55.080]  know about sexually until I was in college stuff I've never even heard of as an adult
[28:55.080 --> 29:02.840]  that they teach children and now you watch everything on television it's anti-male it's
[29:02.840 --> 29:09.480]  wussification women run everything it's degeneracy everything's a joke they're turning us into animals
[29:09.480 --> 29:16.760]  that can't resist and all the violence it desensitizes people the studies show it people can't
[29:16.760 --> 29:22.600]  differentiate all the simulated murders and video games and television with the real thing
[29:22.600 --> 29:26.920]  it's like oh where'd the neighbor go oh they arrested him oh yeah they killed the neighbor
[29:26.920 --> 29:31.320]  he's dead they burned his house down he wouldn't give it to the you know the feds for a green zone

[34:03.080 --> 34:08.200]  are unconstitutional even though i do find these practices disgusting and distasteful of drawings
[34:08.200 --> 34:16.520]  of underage sex and there's a reason cultures have all gone after people that that that that
[34:16.520 --> 34:22.520]  that mess with children a it's unnatural b it's predatory it's praying on the most defenseless
[34:22.520 --> 34:28.040]  in the end and in the heart of humanity this war on children all these sitcoms and dramas

[34:38.760 --> 34:45.640]  six get harassed because these people it's their religion that televisions their friend those messages
[34:45.640 --> 34:52.680]  on tv or their friend and they have this gibbering disdain in their false reality for those of us
[34:52.680 --> 34:57.080]  that actually are part of the human race and part of consciousness and part of reality
[34:57.080 --> 35:05.960]  and so demonize men demonize the family demonize people that are straight see it's not just oh
[35:05.960 --> 35:12.760]  don't don't attack people that are into alternative lifestyles no it's attack people that are straight
[35:14.840 --> 35:24.360]  one time i uh got invited to someone's birthday party and that person was gay and again i don't
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.320]  dislike people that are gay and i go to the party and i'm there with my wife and and and
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.920]  they're probably half the people that were there were were you know that that that sexual preference
[35:34.920 --> 35:38.840]  i was just you know trying to be nice find whatever i don't care you know i'm not gonna
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.080]  obsessed with it it's not like something i'm you know just my whole life is about obsessing
[35:43.080 --> 35:50.520]  about like the media does and just pushing it constantly and i probably had 10 people out of
[35:50.520 --> 35:57.480]  40 or so at the thing go oh you've got kids oh and it's just like i didn't even bring my kids up

[36:02.760 --> 36:09.400]  like i don't need to hear how i'm bad all day okay and and and that's what this is about going
[36:09.400 --> 36:16.600]  into the schools going into the cultures and pushing this on people because it's not just
[36:16.600 --> 36:21.000]  the sexual act it's the and i'm not saying everybody that's involved in that's doing that
[36:21.000 --> 36:28.120]  i'm saying it's it's the politicization and this agenda and it's like a gang but but it's not just
[36:28.120 --> 36:35.080]  a gang into sexual preferences or whatever it's the whole deal germany passes laws no new single
[36:35.080 --> 36:43.000]  family homes by 2020 huge fines and and fees if you have them now you will live in communal dorms
[36:43.000 --> 36:50.920]  that's what the mousey tongue cried and it killed the chinese say 86 million the cia says a 64 million
[36:50.920 --> 36:57.400]  you look it up there's a debate 60 something 80 something mil whatever i mean the folks they killed
[36:58.280 --> 37:05.240]  tens of millions of people trying this they the globalists say if we can ever end the normal human
[37:05.240 --> 37:11.800]  cycle and create an artificial one we've won it's a revolution against humanity and our basic system
[37:11.800 --> 37:18.680]  by control freaks that want to play god and where does communism come from it comes from the jackabins
[37:18.680 --> 37:24.520]  and other illuminati groups i mean mainline history books illuminati jackabins france
[37:24.520 --> 37:31.240]  french revolution this is real history george washington wrote and spoke on this okay i mean this
[37:31.240 --> 37:37.800]  is history after our revolution they have their own and let me tell you it was pure illuminati
[37:37.800 --> 37:45.080]  totally different than ours fashioning itself off what george washington did on the surface but
[37:45.080 --> 37:51.880]  beneath the surface they tried to go to a nine-day week they tried to change the the seasons they tried
[37:51.880 --> 38:00.440]  to end families they tried to oh yes oh yes marx and engels didn't like the communist manifesto
[38:00.440 --> 38:05.880]  that had all been pushed under other names the rothschilds openly financed it all they financed
[38:05.880 --> 38:11.640]  the jackabins and it was not about overthrowing the church and kicking out the monarchy it was
[38:11.640 --> 38:18.040]  about overthrowing humanity and making themselves god and by the 1850s they'd hired most of the
[38:18.040 --> 38:24.360]  top scientists to come up with plans to totally take over society and re-engineer it and that's
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.760]  what this is and now california is set to pass the bill just like the one they passed last year
[38:28.760 --> 38:35.080]  to forcibly inoculate your children without your knowledge i mean that is that is total assault
[38:35.080 --> 38:40.440]  that is totally illegal that is i don't care if you pass a law i mean that is tyranny
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.000]  it isn't just going to stop with highway checkpoints and hands down the pants
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.560]  it's not going to just stop with with inoculations of your children
[38:49.880 --> 38:54.920]  you got thrown out of federal court uh three years ago but california lower courts ruled the
[38:54.920 --> 38:59.400]  parents are no longer the guardians and when your child is in public school that that you
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.080]  cease to be the guardian and the state is now the guardian even when your child's out of school
[39:03.080 --> 39:08.280]  and that homeschooling is illegal because parents are not allowed to be guardians and it did get
[39:08.280 --> 39:16.440]  overthrown it did get overturned but i'm telling you man look these people are hard core scientific
[39:16.440 --> 39:22.600]  authoritarians and they mean business now they've got armies of pedophiles that work for them because
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.040]  they're given access to children they've got other criminal groups they've got different
[39:26.040 --> 39:31.560]  brigades of different types of crime groups they can destroy whenever they want they can blackmail
[39:31.560 --> 39:37.000]  who are given access you want drugs you want money you want power you want to torture people
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.360]  you want to rape children they've got different brigades but their strongest brigade is the pot
[39:42.360 --> 39:48.760]  belly pedophile brigade and it's just an art type it's a pot belly pedophile brigade or the butch
[39:48.760 --> 39:55.720]  pedophile sadomasochistic torture brigade they've got that brigade they've got the mercenary
[39:55.720 --> 40:00.360]  brigades they've got the torture brigades they've got the control freak brigades they've got the
[40:00.360 --> 40:05.000]  deadly do-right danger brigades who actually think they're doing good and they're so stupid
[40:05.000 --> 40:12.760]  they just worship authority that's another dangerous brigade we face and and it's a psych warfare
[40:12.760 --> 40:18.440]  thing on hbo i mean i don't even watch mainline television anytime my wife watches it she's just
[40:18.440 --> 40:23.640]  like my gosh it's all anti-family it's all get abortions kill babies world government take
[40:23.640 --> 40:29.960]  vaccines arrest those that don't and cops watch tv where they arrest people who don't take vaccines
[40:29.960 --> 40:35.960]  in dramas there's no law but then they simulate it they're so when they're taking your kid they're
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.400]  like well i mean the you know the sitcoms the dramas folks i'm talking about the years we've
[40:41.400 --> 40:46.200]  identified dozens and dozens of cases on shows without even looking where they take kids for
[40:46.200 --> 40:52.440]  not taking vaccines and so it must be in hundreds i mean the point is they simulate and show you
[40:52.440 --> 40:59.480]  things that aren't real and then everyone follows it you know this is called mind control this is
[40:59.480 --> 41:09.720]  mind control they've got 110 000 plus us active duty combat on psychotropic that they know is
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.720]  causing them to kill people and their families and epidemics of suicides the drug inserts they
[41:13.720 --> 41:19.640]  give troops for being depressed says will cause suicide can cause suicide i mean that's what i
[41:19.640 --> 41:29.400]  mean it's like children on hbo with giant sexual organ toys with with candy and drinks and the
[41:29.400 --> 41:35.240]  children with the children i mean it is so sick man this is how pedophiles get kids in cars is
[41:35.240 --> 41:41.640]  with candy and they've got kids with candy and and and and and and soft drinks drinking it out of
[41:41.640 --> 41:49.240]  giant artificial male sex organs i just and again it's going to get crazier and crazier and crazier
[41:49.240 --> 41:57.480]  this is a total assault on humanity and and then i read the media and they're like making fun of
[41:57.480 --> 42:04.600]  conservative and christian groups that think this is bad and i'm telling you folks you know you know
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.840]  i don't want violence in this country i've done everything i can to try to stop it and try to
[42:08.840 --> 42:15.640]  turn things back but do not try to come and give my children inoculations secretly or if they
[42:15.640 --> 42:19.240]  weren't a government training camp and they want to bankrupt the economy which they've done so you
[42:19.240 --> 42:24.120]  basically have to have them in there the quote free education paid for with the property tax that
[42:24.120 --> 42:29.560]  turned us all into renters on our own property we didn't have that until 60 years ago churches weren't
[42:29.560 --> 42:36.920]  501c 3 until 60 years ago or so it's a total overthrow of everything but do not get around my
[42:36.920 --> 42:42.760]  children you pedophiles and don't try to shoot anybody up let me tell you you think you're all
[42:42.760 --> 42:47.160]  dug in and and and and you know you're starting to fight with us so the cops are all in body armor
[42:47.160 --> 42:50.680]  and armored vehicles that's not going to mean anything when you mess with people's kids okay
[42:50.680 --> 42:56.600]  and you enforcers out there need to decide what side you're on man because this is that you could
[42:56.600 --> 43:09.800]  not be clear how ridiculous this is i don't think we have hbo on our dish network out in the country
[43:09.800 --> 43:14.760]  and we don't even really use it we should just cancel it it's incredibly clear hi it's nice hd
[43:14.760 --> 43:19.400]  it's good to watch science programs with my kids but that's always got some anti-human brainwashing
[43:19.400 --> 43:27.320]  in it i everyone should dump hbo i mean i think i'm calling for a boycott of it right now but that's
[43:27.320 --> 43:32.680]  not enough they should be the i don't care they say it's a comedy show they have real children
[43:33.640 --> 43:36.760]  do they got their parents i guess who want to be stars or whatever
[43:38.520 --> 43:43.080]  and stuck them in this and they need to be arrested okay it is it is it they were trying
[43:43.080 --> 43:49.720]  to train children and desensitize them and associate candy with they're i mean they are
[43:49.720 --> 43:55.800]  ruining these this is illegal this is illegal this is illegal this is illegal this is illegal
[44:00.280 --> 44:05.320]  and i just i just again they're pushing us they they want the fight they want the fight
[44:08.280 --> 44:12.360]  and you know once the fight starts it's going to be indiscriminate because you let me tell you
[44:12.360 --> 44:21.160]  something you either better join the republic if this thing goes physical or you better get ready
[44:21.880 --> 44:28.200]  for punishment and judgment that's all i can say because let me tell you you're part of this system
[44:28.200 --> 44:34.600]  when all this stuff goes down all the bankers set offshore
[44:34.600 --> 44:40.360]  or because they're they're not going to stop
[44:43.560 --> 44:45.800]  the crimes this system commits against us
[44:48.120 --> 44:51.640]  all right i said i take calls i'll take calls for about 40 minutes i'll try to shut up
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.320]  and then i'll get it all over the news i haven't even got into it yet huge earthquakes increasing
[44:57.320 --> 45:01.480]  i've got the numbers big economy news big high-tech news north korea news
[45:01.480 --> 45:05.960]  news i didn't even cover this yesterday it's such big news the washington post came out and
[45:05.960 --> 45:10.680]  admitted that bill derbergh is choosing vice presidential candidates so they've gone from
[45:10.680 --> 45:15.160]  saying it doesn't exist in the washington post for 60 plus years being at all the bill derbergh
[45:15.160 --> 45:21.240]  meetings the grand family and saying it didn't exist to now just admitting that they choose vp's see
[45:22.200 --> 45:26.360]  they're coming out in the open yeah bill derbergh runs things and yeah we're gonna teach kids
[45:26.360 --> 45:30.680]  that pedophiles get underway with them i mean that it's just like what what yeah world
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.320]  government's taking over uh-huh yeah we took that guy's land for agenda 21 he's dead now
[45:36.120 --> 45:37.880]  and don't try to go in the city council building
[45:42.600 --> 45:46.760]  it's a psi op to just totally blow us away and it's not having that effect on me
[45:50.920 --> 45:55.320]  you got to do a banner hang you got to write websites on them on the federal reserve money
[45:55.320 --> 46:00.040]  you've got to you've got to get a bullhorn out today you've got to do whatever you got you
[46:00.040 --> 46:07.880]  got to make a splash in a peaceful but aggressive way because the inability to make some sacrifices
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.120]  now there was some other report about a cop getting attacked by some guy and shot and
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.480]  people watch the fight go on for like 10 minutes it didn't help the police officer
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.240]  and that's because people see the police now as not their friends even though in most cases
[46:21.240 --> 46:25.240]  that's not the case the system hasn't fully warped the police yet on average that's what
[46:25.240 --> 46:30.600]  they're trying to create the tsa is this new whole cloth thing you know where they have no
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.960]  training and and and just do one thing follow orders but i see it everywhere now where people
[46:35.960 --> 46:40.520]  are raped in broad daylight hurt run over in front of hundreds of people no one helps them
[46:41.720 --> 46:45.080]  and it's because they've turned people into just the spectating
[46:45.080 --> 46:56.440]  emasculated wussified little jellyfish creatures who just who just bumble around like mole rats or
[46:56.440 --> 47:05.000]  something on parade simply put evil has been released into the world at a level ever before
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.400]  seen and i can feel it and i can see it intellectually we're about to take the plunge
[47:09.400 --> 47:16.600]  and i'm going to tell you again ladies and gentlemen appeasing this is not going to make
[47:16.600 --> 47:20.920]  your life get better okay america had half the wealth of the world was five percent of the
[47:20.920 --> 47:26.120]  population not because we were perfect but because our forebears were mean and aggressive
[47:26.120 --> 47:32.600]  and independent and would not be pushed around would rather die than be a slave and so we bathed
[47:32.600 --> 47:37.160]  in wealth and power and so we became the center of the new world order because it took us over
[47:37.160 --> 47:44.840]  and now we are rotting the america is a rotting corpse of the old republic and people are now
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.960]  seeing the maggots spill out and the guts are all blown up and swollen and and and then the
[47:49.960 --> 47:57.800]  stench and the global banker vultures are eating our flesh and and uh but a republic
[47:58.600 --> 48:04.600]  is not an individual it's a it's an idea it's a system it can rise again all right that's enough
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.520]  robert in texas you're on the air first caller of the day welcome
[48:09.960 --> 48:16.360]  thanks for having me on uh first off i i'm pretty sure that that missile that north korea
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.680]  launch was shot down i would i'd be willing to bet that somebody shot it down with a laser
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.000]  yeah they got lasers they can have c 130's what 50 miles away and do it they've also
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.080]  got mirror refractors on the satellites and i meant to say that i've talked to some of the
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.200]  people involved in star wars and every time north korea tries to shoot one it now it now blows off
[48:34.200 --> 48:39.800]  shortly after it leaves the tarmac well i have a pretty good source from uh android department
[48:39.800 --> 48:46.760]  of energy who uh tells me that we got stuff that makes all conventional weaponry out there obsolete
[48:46.760 --> 48:51.800]  so again the bankers have that yeah they have particle beams uh but just the just the chemical
[48:51.800 --> 48:58.440]  lasers they admit they have on drones and in those dc 10s are amazing well once they roll it out and
[48:58.440 --> 49:02.920]  tell people about it that then you can pretty much bet it's in itself obsolete and there's
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.240]  something better that yes it's at least 50 years old yeah yeah chemical lasers on aircraft is at
[49:07.240 --> 49:14.600]  least from the 1950s yeah yeah hey um real quick if you are in south central texas area

[55:54.280 --> 55:58.680]  here myself and my fellow info warriors were launching a massive offensive against the new
[55:58.680 --> 56:05.320]  world order on sunday april 15 good target our target is the india and senator chip rogers he's
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.920]  our state senator from our district he's having a town hall meeting at the woods public library
[56:10.920 --> 56:15.960]  on sunday april 15 at two o'clock and i'm calling to get this message out to all the fellow info
[56:15.960 --> 56:21.400]  warriors out there who are kind of local hopefully can come out and join us so basically senator chip
[56:21.400 --> 56:28.280]  rogers like every other gop senator in red states really across the country he's faced with a big
[56:28.280 --> 56:33.400]  upswell of liberty minded folks who are in the gop who are really changing the complexion of the
[56:33.400 --> 56:38.840]  party and so he has been busy trying to co-op that movement while still trying to play patty cakes
[56:38.840 --> 56:43.880]  and you know keep doing the hokey pokey with the establishment now so far he's been paying us a lot
[56:43.880 --> 56:47.640]  of lip service he's been patting us on the head shaking our hands i've been going to these town
[56:47.640 --> 56:52.360]  hall meetings but he hasn't really been introducing any great legislation i'll give you an example of
[56:52.360 --> 56:56.280]  some of the legislation he introduced this year that he has on his website bragging about he did
[56:56.280 --> 57:01.080]  introduce uh nascar license plates now we're gonna have nascar license plates in georgia so you
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.880]  know we're very happy about those and he also introduced an internet sales tax or he introduced
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.840]  that i'm sorry but he voted for it and he did support it it passed out of his senate and now
[57:10.840 --> 57:15.000]  also we're going to pay a tax on used car sales so private used car sales are going to be taxed
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.320]  here in georgia so we've got some great things uh great victories for liberty of course i'm being
[57:19.320 --> 57:24.600]  facetious but right now i've got a group of probably about 25 people strong we're going to go out to

[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:05.800]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good size
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:11.320]  meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.320]  that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:21.080]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:27.960]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin

[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:17.080]  okay we're gonna finish up with mike here a caller if you just joined us
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:24.440]  he's calling us from somewhere in new york when they have woodchucks raccoons invading their property
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.240]  and i guess the police are saying you're not allowed to do anything to him in fact i've seen
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.560]  cases in new york in the country in a rural area number like 15 years ago the guy uh uh
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:44.120]  he got arrested for killing a rat and then it was such a big deal that he killed a rat that
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.080]  neighbors called the police on him and he went to jail for animal cruelty now remember you can buy
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:56.280]  decon rat killer all day but he was arrested again there's no law you've got to take a vaccine but
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:02.120]  more and more they're taking your kids it's a lawlessness so if you've got raccoons invading
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:09.800]  and and getting your trash can or or eating your backyard garden just get a high-powered
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:15.320]  pellet gun and and start shooting i mean that's what i do and i was joking about building a
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:21.400]  silencer that's illegal but they do have primitive silencers that you can use you know uh on a shot
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.520]  gun or something if you don't want to bother your neighbors but obviously don't use a shotgun on the
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:32.360]  city i mean i've got a friend out in the country and he's got a line of of tires out in front of
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.120]  his little shooting bench he lives in the country he can shoot you know all day if he wants but he
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.280]  doesn't like to bug his neighbors that are you know 10 acres over when he's shooting high caliber
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:49.160]  you know guns that are really noisy and for a long time he shoots through the barrels at the target
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:55.000]  and so look at the scope you don't even see the barrels around it but it just dissipates the
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.680]  audio to an incredible level i think my dad was out there at the mutual friend's house just a few
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:06.440]  months ago shooting and just said it was amazing uh that it was such a but but again i digress with
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:15.000]  a factoid there i mean look a daisy red rider that costs like 50 bucks my children have got those
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:22.440]  and they're incredibly accurate like i felt kind of bad the other day across the creek it's about
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.600]  from my porch to across the little creek it's probably about 50 yards and there was a bird
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:37.160]  sitting up in a tree and i was shooting showing my son um you know that he could shoot things that
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.440]  far away with it but but how to elevate and i just knocked that bird right off its perch and killed
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.400]  it i wasn't even trying to kill it i was just trying to shoot in its general direction to make it fly
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.640]  but a red rider single pump will deal won't kill it probably won't even pierce the skin
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.560]  the raccoon you start lighting them up with that they're not going to come around you know if you
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:05.160]  have fish ponds and they're coming in and eating your fish it's time to i mean my parents have them
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.120]  invading their house when they if they forget and don't close the the the dog door for their french
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:18.920]  bulldog and my dad nicely goes in with a broom and one time he had like i think 14 of them in the house
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.160]  raccoons are really smart and i said listen dad you got to start shooting them with a
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.880]  pellet gun they think they run everything you pull up you walk up sometimes as it's getting dark you
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.840]  see coons on the roof looking at you my dad's like oh i kind of like them i'll just restock the pond
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.040]  so there's coons waiting around eating all this fish that's why mountain lions eat people out in
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.840]  california not in other states because in other states they're hiding because they know you'll
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.520]  shoot them same thing with wolves or coyotes now coyotes are coming into built up areas and for
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:53.960]  the first time in over 100 years are killing people it's always the same a woman is walking at the
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:12:00.760]  park runs falls five coyotes chew her throat out if you wouldn't have run from them they wouldn't
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:06.680]  have thought you were a prey animal we got mountain lions here it was in one of the local papers
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.560]  just a few months ago that somebody had one of those deer feeder cameras out motion cameras
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.480]  and you know there was that big old mountain lion we got big ones around here those things are so
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:21.320]  scared of humans and they should be because if i see one in my backyard i'm going to shoot it because
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:27.400]  if i don't they will kill my little children that look like juicy delectable treats to them
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:35.640]  they need to learn that we're the dominant species they're like roaches and they're beautiful
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.880]  animals but they're all over the place they're not letting people kill polar bears up in canada and
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.680]  alaska in many areas so they're now starting to kill people they're coming into the towns
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.840]  they're starting to come further and further south they're their numbers who are up conservatively
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.240]  three-fold some estimates are five-fold i'm now digressing i've got to move quicker to calls
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.800]  okay mike so long story short you're supposed to call the police when the raccoons are assaulting
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:02.280]  you sound like you live in a suburb quasi rural area tell us where you live finish the story
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:09.800]  orange county new york and uh you're kind of on the right track uh friend police officer comes out
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:14.600]  and you know we tell him about the story and stuff and you know what he recommends uh something you
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:23.000]  didn't discuss but a cb 22 and if come to find out it's totally legal because there's no gunpowder
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.560]  and it's just primer and it doesn't exceed 700 feet per second which is coming up in the trial
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:37.320]  and you know the ironic thing about this is this cop i i'm so angry at is that he came up and lied
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.920]  that he didn't have any idea what i was talking about he didn't recall the incident so on so
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:49.400]  forth to save his butt so to speak anyways the uh the story evolves how i got arrested
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:56.920]  i killed probably 30 woodchucks took two shots uh you typically but on this one afternoon
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.240]  the same neighbor that was there while this officer uh instructed me and and said why don't
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:08.360]  you just shoot a mic you're a good shot aren't you i said of course p i said how did you get
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:15.160]  arrested for shooting stupid woodchucks yeah exactly it's all the neighbor got mad after a
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.360]  12 hour work day i was working around my house at seven o'clock in the evening i see this woodchuck
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:25.960]  up here so i shoot him and i got him right in the head i know i come outside i said jim my next
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:32.600]  door neighbor did you see the woodchuck he says what he says i i just shot a woodchuck he says you
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.160]  promised never to shoot it wouldn't like kids were at home so what are you talking about
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:43.880]  and he promptly went inside his house let me ask you a question are you are you in a rural area
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:51.240]  quasi semi rural yeah listen i've seen cases now i've seen two in the last three or four months
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.960]  where people live on the edge of the country they've lived there for years and they and they
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.920]  shoot a deer or in one case the guy ran over one and thought well i just killed it i'll go
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.160]  butcher it which actually makes a lot of sense in some areas they take you know the fresh roadkill
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.120]  and feed it to the homeless it's good meat and he and now if people see you butchering a deer
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.600]  they call the police and even though it's not illegal they arrest you and say it's disturbing
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:21.640]  the peace these idiots go to the store buy meat i again i saw this a few years ago i was out fishing
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:26.520]  and i was at the boat dock i'd come back from fishing back when i had a little time to do such
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:31.400]  things and there was a fisherman they're cutting up a bunch of catfish and bass and he had an
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.440]  electric knife and i saw these trendies go by i guess down to the sailboat area and they were
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.800]  like oh my gosh you know he's cutting fish up i mean they're so domesticated they don't know
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.880]  where electricity comes from they don't know where the meat in the store with a with a with a
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:52.040]  saran wrap on it comes from uh they i've seen cases where where people have seen their neighbors
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:57.000]  skinning squirrels they went and shot legally and then they call the police on them calling an animal
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:05.080]  cruelty i mean i remember my grandpa routinely would walk out in the backyard shoot a squirrel
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:10.360]  skin it in about a minute and go in and cook it as a little side dish to what my grandma'd make
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.840]  and and to the average person that is weird
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:23.960]  to the average person it's it's i mean it is it is weird and like abusive to have deer hanging up
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:29.800]  i mean that's what humans do we'd be a lot healthier if we actually did hunt and butcher stuff ourselves
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:37.480]  these people are crazy they're crazy dracon pot roast i don't think that would be too good talk
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:43.400]  about uh gaming but i'll tell you in the great depression even middle class people had to there
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.560]  sometimes there wasn't even meat at the store or you couldn't afford it and there were almost no
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:54.520]  raccoons possums or deer left in each texas where my dad's family's from at the end of uh the um
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:03.000]  depression because they'd eaten them and i get and i'm like some barbarian creature and i don't
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.480]  i'm not even good at at at chopping up a deer perfectly like my dad or my uncle can do uh i
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.200]  mean i know how to do it because i've done it a few times but it's kind of like you just let your
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.760]  kid be lazy like alex you shot three deer today well that's what i could shoot this year and they all
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.480]  came by okay you got to help us and be you know halfway into one i like wander off into the
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:29.800]  cookhouse and my dad's out there field dressing at all uh and then chopping it all up and uh
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:38.120]  side issue ah boy i need to be arrested i'm bad let's go ahead and talk to fred in wisconsin
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:43.720]  thanks for holding fred you're on the air no problem hey alex it's your uh your friend the
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:49.880]  sopa protester we talked a few months ago yes sir um uh the reason i'm calling is i wanted to know
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:55.720]  did you see this video that was released of the autistic child that was shocked 31 times for not
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:03.800]  removing his coat yeah in fact i i mentioned it yesterday and and people would think that i try to
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:10.440]  make the system look bad but but most of the time i don't even use the information i've got against the
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:17.000]  system because i've already looked at it and it's so depressing to watch that i then don't even play
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  it on the air that's what i'm saying if i'm guilty of anything it's holding back guys will you queue
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.600]  up the video of the autistic child uh being uh shocked we had it up at info wars.com and i'm
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:34.760]  gonna have that reposted uh there on the site uh because there is an epidemic of torture and what
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.760]  they call paying compliance and so we'll play that after the break but give us your take on that
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.080]  well you know i watched this and this is because he wouldn't remove his coat and all i could think
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:51.640]  was this is my brother this is my sister they'd be lucky if they got this guy in court before i got
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:59.160]  to him because it made me so angry i mean 31 times that this is torture and the kids autistic you
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.040]  know so they bring them to the hospital no no no torture is now legal they call it paying
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:10.360]  compliance the courts have ruled they can break arms they can kill you and again and again it's
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.400]  really illegal but the crazy scum are just normalizing it do you see what's happening
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:22.440]  they're laughing while they're doing it and this center is still open why isn't this guy's face
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:28.040]  on a 2012 poster why isn't this all over the media you know they're covering the story in Florida
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:35.080]  sir i've got footage of them breaking protesters arms now they they are trained not to break your
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:45.720]  arm i mean hbo shows little girls engaging in fallatio on television i mean and then and then
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.480]  the media says we're bad for not liking it anything else you want to add
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.560]  ah that's sick that's always fun to hear from you alec thank you sir yeah well we'll actually

[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:06.040]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:11.240]  sized meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:15.880]  of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world

[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:45.000]  pain compliance and homeland security of course three years ago had meetings and proposed
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:53.160]  fitting everyone who gets on an airplane at the airport at the tsa molestation slave training
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:25:02.360]  facility with a taser bracelet now already with the masses of brain damaged and a neurologically
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:08.440]  harmed children the the the little dungeons they have formed at the public schools get bigger and
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:15.400]  bigger and bigger and bigger and so all over the country they have them fitted with these taser belts
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.960]  and taser bracelets and they have the restraint chairs and if you don't follow any order they
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:29.400]  give you you are tortured in this case for seven hours and when it's on the news they're like
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:35.880]  it's controversial no it's illegal you're just power grabbing you're just training us that
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.640]  we have no rights you're training us that we're slaves you're training us you can do whatever
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:45.480]  you want and i've seen federal and state court's rule police can taser you to make you answer
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.240]  questions or urinate in a cup those are real cases look them up one case they tortured a guy
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.840]  was it eight times to make him answer questions what happened to fifth amendment
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:02.680]  this is like north korea what they're trying to do they're trying to have this revolution against
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.320]  our republic and common sense and due process in the name of safety but the greatest danger
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:12.920]  is a government that acts like this and it's happening everything our forebears warned us of
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.640]  and so here's a child being tortured for for not taking his coat off autistic
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.600]  probably by all the vaccines it's mainly boys because their blood brain barrier isn't as strong
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.960]  they don't doubt it's exploding they just say keep taking the shots everything's fine
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:35.320]  and that's not enough now they're going to taser him over and over and over and over again
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.400]  and this is the main lining of it where we're animals that get cattle prodded if we don't do
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:51.080]  what we're told police say license the registration no do it till i tell you give it to me now this
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.720]  is what they're telling him to do it's about there the boss and now the cops are like you
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:00.120]  can't go in the city council building at two o'clock in the afternoon don't says public building
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.960]  i got a gun right here pal get your info wars reporters and get out of here
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.520]  let's go i mean this is the essence of tyranny and they're going to take your bank accounts the
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:15.000]  value of your dollar see with all this tyranny they're setting this tyranny up because they're
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.960]  going to hurt everybody you understand people like oh i don't care if they're doing that people
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:26.280]  i saw what they want to hurt you too because they like it and they and a lot of these cops
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.560]  aren't even bad people that they just believe well i'm allowed to taser you for no reason
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.800]  because i'm in charge let's go ahead and go to part of this local fox news clip on this report
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.000]  here it is the public can see for itself what these controversial electric shocks look like
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:56.360]  in use dramatic video of new york this man is on a rack like they had in dungeons 800 years ago
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:03.320]  it's a little controversial but you know it's needed let's cut to a prison school that's what
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:10.840]  they are with a guy on a rack and they tortured him for seven hours and they just it's just like oh
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:17.560]  up next hbo shows six year old girls performing fellatio
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.160]  again it's just all psychological warfare and they admitted this it's just getting you ready
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.320]  and now they're like well we are actually looking at releasing a bio weapon to kill most people
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:36.840]  and the in the media is like maybe it's needed if it's trendy uh i mean again this is the
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.520]  twilight zone this go back to it because the real torture is about to begin go ahead
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:50.840]  dramatic video of new york teenager andre mccollins restrained face down a helmet on his head
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:29:07.800]  screaming for help the judge rotenberg center calls it treatment as mccollins attorney just
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:13.960]  described the teenager was shocked 31 times in all that day in 2002 mccollins is suing the
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:19.080]  canton base center calling it torture lawyers for the center and its clinicians say mccollins
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.320]  needed aversive therapy because he was aggressive these are dramatic tapes there's no questions like
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:30.200]  that but the treatment plan all right we're gonna go to bright and come back but the point is this
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:35.080]  is being done in schools everywhere not just this facility so they tell parents don't spank your
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:39.880]  children don't be in charge when they're little so then they're out of control well now you put
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:45.400]  them in torture chairs see how they do this the state says don't spank your child it will take
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:52.360]  them but we're gonna shock them see how that works we're right back we're on the march the empires
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:30:04.360]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hi folks this is alex jones i'm looking for people

[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.880]  they know what they're doing
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:49.080]  and they're doing it in our face just like yesterday by the way have you talked to
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:55.160]  mcbrainer we're gonna get an update from them in the third hour chris because as i as i announced
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:59.880]  yesterday we're gonna have them back on the show today so when i said we're not having guests that's
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:06.440]  not really entirely uh completely true we announced on the radio yesterday we'll get another update
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:12.920]  from them and on the nightly news and of course on monday here in studio up there in georgia
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:23.400]  where the gentleman kept beating them in court dealing with the chickens that he had on his
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:34.200]  little farm but they showed him he's dead now and when our crew got there and tried to go on
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:39.480]  the city council the police pulled up and acted like they were criminals and said turn your cameras
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:46.120]  off and said you're not allowed in there and of course we could have forced the issue and gone in
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.120]  and then heaven knows what would have happened because here are a couple articles speaking of
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:59.720]  tasering children georgia man sews the police here's another one georgia man says autistic son
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:06.280]  tasered uh they also then charged the guy with a whole bunch of uh felonies but a jury did not
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.680]  convict him georgia father said monday that he was outraged over police use of a taser against
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:20.440]  his son the man said the son suffers from autism and officers knew it another one of the vaccine
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:27.560]  damaged oh see the problem is that the the vaccine didn't kill him i mean that's the problem so he's
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.760]  got to be tasered the incident was captured on police dashcam video the video was presented in a
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:41.880]  cherokee county courtroom his son jd moran um said multiple officers surrounded him cuffed
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:47.560]  him to the ground and then tasering well yeah like the person's not resisting he's leaving
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:52.360]  they want to show him he shouldn't have said something to john carrey and he's so he's got his
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:57.720]  hands there up like why are you doing this why did you tackle me why are you grabbing me and he just
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:04.600]  says don't taser me bro and they're like we're going to this is our power the globalists put
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:09.400]  cancer viruses in our shots and fluoride in our water they like killing us and we like killing you
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.400]  now have some voltage and because tasers aren't killing enough people they've upped the power
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.120]  and they say they're gonna up it again they're just going to be upping it and upping it to like
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:26.600]  yeah you die sometimes if we do it but you want to take that risk do what we say do what we say
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:32.760]  and the society degenerates it's not just the police that are degenerating it's everything
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:38.840]  it's going to get crazier and crazier
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:47.480]  and it's on the tape that they tackled him jumped on him you know he had the handcuffs already on
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.160]  and then they charged him with resisting because they wanted tasering to show him a little lesson
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.040]  and then it's like oh and you assaulted us we're going to put some felonies on you but the video
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:02.840]  doesn't show that so they're like oh gee i wish that taser was maybe five times more powerful
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:10.360]  then there wouldn't need to be a trial would there but hey there's people above you that
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:21.160]  like to kill too don't worry and they are it goes on parents of autistic boy who was tasered
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:27.080]  questioned police actions now here's another one 12 year old autistic boy was shot last month with
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:36.840]  police stun gun at the hawthorne middle school accused police officials not servants officials
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:43.080]  kings on monday removing their son from school in handcuffs days after the incident and subjecting
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:48.920]  him to interrogation and retaliation for a misconduct complaint the family had filed on top

[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:13.560]  tell you about was uh some ron paul supporters from up here in montana we uh did a we we i saw
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:19.160]  a poster of this west league art speech that he was coming and uh they had talking points on there
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:25.560]  and they made it look like he was going to uh you know they like oh you know oh we're gonna tell the
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:31.560]  real truth about 9 11 and i don't think we were told the real truth on that and other things on
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:36.440]  their other talking points i can't remember of all now oh about you know we were going to attack
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:41.800]  these countries in this certain order so i thought boom this could be real interesting so a lot of
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.560]  us went and they said that uh there was going to be a question and answer period with them and and uh
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:54.200]  so there really was and it was three students chosen students they got up there and let me tell
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:40:00.600]  you about this speech okay so he gets up there and he gets the speech and uh afterwards the
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:05.960]  students give him uh just lob softballs to him i mean there was no questions about the n d double
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:13.720]  a or uh wars without congressional approval you know there these were just little softball
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:17.960]  questions anyway but this is what the speech was like alex it was absolutely you could tell
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:26.200]  well he was 100 percent uh just new world order all the way because he starts out he's telling us
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:32.280]  it was like he had just seen your speech on democide because he gave us about 15 points on
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:38.040]  how great the government is everything oh they built our railroad force they built our highways
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.720]  no government literally is god to these people that's why they want to ruin our reproductive
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:48.920]  system so you've got to go to the government health bureau to have them basically turn your dna

[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:06.120]  bringing in austerity to bankrupt and impoverish the public so they're too busy trying to find food
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:10.280]  than to fight back so the social engineers can roll in with welfare payments if they'll take the
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:16.520]  vaccine to soft kill their families ok continuing here as we report on the global offensives against
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.800]  humanity reporting from fema region six yeah i used to run liners like 10 years ago about deep
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:27.480]  behind enemy lines fema region six and i'd get program directors of affiliates going what is this
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:34.280]  behind enemy lines or are you saying america's the enemy uh regions six what is this stuff
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:44.840]  and we play a clip from um red dawn guys youtube red dawn radio transmission something like that
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.040]  and it's like hi this is you know transmitting from you know the free area into the soviet
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:55.000]  occupied area john has a long mustache john has a long mustache puts out some codes for
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:01.720]  special forces behind enemy lines and then says and remember if you're on or behind enemy lines
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:07.640]  this song is for you and then they go into the music we need to get that liner back they used
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.440]  to be in the computer up there john and just for some reason it just disappeared out of the system
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:17.240]  but i want to get that clip from red dawn and you play that going out of the break with music it
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:21.880]  sounds pretty powerful because that's what we're actually doing i mean that's what this is but
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:27.640]  see it's a psychological warfare takeover so all the regular institutions and things are still there
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:33.880]  but it's a creeping takeover you see which is much harder to beat than a bunch of soviets parachuting
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:42.120]  out of the sky so i mean it's not a joke i come to you from behind enemy lines i'm an occupied
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:48.280]  former republic we are the banks admit the big mega banks they have conquered the united states
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:59.160]  this is real and but but wait the basketball is on dancing with the stars is on and we've
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.040]  got cnn we've got the american flag everywhere people put the american flag everywhere and
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.840]  and they think that means worshiping the system crying and worshiping government and waving
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:14.840]  american flags and it now symbolizes gullibility and that you want to be used and and if you say
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:18.440]  don't want to hey the troops are down and do your poisoning most of them don't want to be in the wars
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:24.120]  they go shut up traitor but we need to end the war and i've seen these videos i saw one they just
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:32.040]  released a few days ago um adam cokesh did where they're talking to this woman a mit romney supporter
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.480]  and they're like but the wars the wars are illegal and and and they're about resources and and
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:41.720]  they're wrong and she's like you just hate our military we need to support them and support
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.880]  the wars they're like but supporting the wars doesn't support the military the majority of the
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:49.880]  troops and major polls want to be out of these wars and the majority of the money given to you
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:54.120]  know the presidential candidates to ron paul she's like that's not true they're like yeah it's the
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:46:00.760]  sec filings no it's not you just hate the military well actually i was you know in feluja the
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.400]  cameraman says and was in iraq for years as a marine oh yeah right and i have to know who the
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:15.080]  guy is he was and then oh yeah the troops want the war the troops want the war i'm for the troops
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:21.640]  and she's got like american flags for student honor and she's waving a big i mean they have no
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:29.480]  conception of reality these people they have no conception they think the government and the police
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:36.920]  is america and and we're like the enemy government is god government is good like in north korea
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.320]  anything it does is infallible and the cops now more and more believe this i mean i'm real sad

[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:10.920]  now though a little more because i lost the weight i can run further and things but yeah show me
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:17.240]  you're endorsing the info wars team products for sure i was i started about 290 and uh after about
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:23.640]  two months i'm about 240 now so i mean did you notice that just suddenly i mean because i can't
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.360]  get my own food during the break and i bought the office barbecue today so they brought me a plate
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.080]  that was like a big plate and i ate like a third of it and then didn't even i just stopped in the
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:40.040]  old days i would eat that entire plate exactly i mean it's just like a miracle product you only
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:44.600]  eat half the stuff the way just falls off you feel better than you ever felt and well the reason
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.480]  for my call though is not to really uh about the tangerine is yesterday i was involved in something
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:55.640]  um i was i was almost arrested yesterday uh by a police officer because i was having electrical
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:00.520]  problems at my house and i went to turn the breaker box off because i had uh flickering
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:07.560]  lights and arcing wires so i went to cut the power to get my breaker box fixed uh my next
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:12.200]  star neighbor shares a pump with me a water pump and it's run off of my power box so when i shed
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:16.840]  it off they called the cops on me saying that i did it out of spite to cut them off of water
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:21.080]  which wasn't true i i was cutting it off to prevent my house from burning down i know listen
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:27.240]  it's this culture because again the who's really bad are these citizens who call the police for no
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:33.080]  reason i mean folks you better not call the police unless you got a serious issue i mean a lot of
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:39.400]  times i see stuff and if it's petty i don't even call the police because it most of the time it
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:43.400]  just causes a problem so what happened the police officer came over and i mean you're gonna get
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:48.120]  arrested now everybody knows when you're having problems turn your electricity off it's like if
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.960]  your toilet breaks i've had a waterline break you go turn the water off i mean what finish the story

[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:26.920]  and now live from austin texas alex jones all right let me finish up with a caller here and
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:30.120]  and then i need to get back into some of the news i haven't covered yet including some earthquake
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.480]  news it's very important obviously also big predictions by uh noah weather service of huge
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:40.840]  tornadoes throughout the middle of the country into texas over the weekend with uh some of the
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.400]  hot and cold air coming together so definitely look out for that you know smart like the old
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:50.040]  timers had storm sellers nowadays we just watch tv and do what the government says
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:56.440]  that'll protect us from the tornadoes it's this culture of of always counting on the system to
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:03.160]  do everything for you the nanny state is totally domesticating us look at this article i see stories
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:15.960]  like this all the time and we'll put that article on screen for prison planet dot tv viewers
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:26.600]  a man was shot more than 90 times with no firearm or no weapon his crime was running from the police
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:38.200]  okay just so i can read it i just want to have it where the headline in the text is like right
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:43.960]  there in the middle that that's the shot i want to show people right there you see to get a better
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.720]  computer i know that computer is a little bit see i see the ad just got off a little bit
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:52.440]  the way i wanted is where you can see the white on the other side of the headline right there where
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:10:03.640]  i can see it eight la officers fire more than 90 bullets at freeway chase suspect who said he had
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:08.520]  a gun and so i can see over the fact that they claim that someone said that he had a gun so he
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:22.280]  was shot 90 times i mean i think 90s a little excessive how about only 89 shots okay uh let's go
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:28.920]  ahead and uh go back and finish up with a caller who was talking about how he i guess he's in a
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:33.640]  duplex his lights were going all crazy his power was going all crazy so he went and turned the
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:40.040]  power breaker off so the neighbor instead of talking to him called the police on him i mean if i saw
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:46.680]  my neighbor flip a breaker and my power went off i'd say hey bob why'd you turn the power off what's
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:53.240]  going on before i call the police and then bob said shut up you deserve it i'd be like hey you better
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:11:00.600]  turn that back on her i don't have to call the police quite frankly i'd probably get mad but
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:08.040]  whatever go ahead and finish your story so you're up to the point of you turn the power breaker off
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:12.760]  and that's connected also to the water pump that goes to both sides of the house uh finish up with
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:17.400]  what happened yes sir it's uh well we live in the country and it's a shared pump with the
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:21.880]  me and my uncle who lives next door and i had a lot of problems with my uncle uh they they tried
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:25.720]  to kill me in the past they got arrested with assault with a deadly weapon the charges were
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:30.200]  never filed so we got a restraining order then there was about 30 instances where the restraining
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:34.760]  order got broken nothing really happened over it that's why the reason why they called the cops right
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:42.200]  away um it's because of ongoing problem but but the thing is i mean i pay i pay the pgne it's all
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:48.360]  it's in my name it's under my uh uh you know i called pgne before the cops got there and asked if i
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.400]  was within my rights to turn it off and they said i was most certainly was and my lawyer also said i
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.600]  was too so when the cop got there it was a it was a lady officer and she was uh she was already
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:03.080]  upset as soon as she got out the door because she had known about the ongoing problem soon as she
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:08.680]  walked out of her cop car she's like i know you don't like him and he doesn't like you and just
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:14.680]  attitude right out the door so i had it turned off and so she goes and turns them all back on
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:19.800]  and so then i went up to the box and was going to turn them back off saying listen lady
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:25.800]  if you turn this power on my house could burn down and she said if you turn off those switches
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:31.000]  i'm going to arrest you and she was reaching for a cop and i've always made the point with the police
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:37.480]  now saying you can't go in the city council on video for no reason with police you know saying
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:41.400]  we're gonna take your kid because you didn't give them shots no law what they're doing is illegal
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:47.560]  it's reached the point like north korea where pretty soon you come in the cops are like cook me a
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:54.040]  chocolate cake you're like no i'm gonna arrest you then so so what happened she she flipped it back
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:13:00.040]  on and what happened she flipped them all back on uh i go back up there to to turn them back off
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:05.720]  stand listen it's it's a huge hatchet from my house a fire hazard whatever and uh she says if i turn
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:09.720]  them back off she's gonna arrest me and reach us first yeah see see see here's the deal i would
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:16.040]  show up and say i am not your nanny to the other neighbor you need to call an electrician don't
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:22.840]  call the police for this and i would leave yeah i mean i mean literally where is common sense in
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:29.240]  this country call an electrician not the police exactly well they thought because of all the problems
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:33.560]  in the past they just call the cops first thing i mean they don't even talk to me it's just calling
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:39.080]  the cops but yeah i know they're they're they're a lot of these weirdos who call the police constantly
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.200]  i mean i had a neighbor i'm not gonna get into it it's just crazy thank you for the call i really
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:52.280]  appreciate the point she just made sir okay let me get into this earthquake news here because
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:59.400]  there's a lot of disinformation going on fracking when it's done in in areas that are built up or
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:05.480]  when it's done improperly is a problem it is toxic chemicals that they use in extracting natural gas
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.680]  and oil ensuring up the different stratas it is needed to get the oil and gas it can be done
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:21.800]  properly but what's happening is now it's being blamed for earthquakes that are happening in the
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:28.600]  midwest and other areas and there are major studies that show that uh giant oil fields over time can
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:37.160]  suck out enough oil or gas to then in one big event have some settling or a small earthquake
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:42.920]  that's been confirmed but they're now saying that earthquakes in the midwest and other areas
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:48.600]  are being caused by fracking period that's an article out of bloomberg and that's just not
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:54.200]  the case i mean the mississippi river has had its course change repeatedly in the last 200 years
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:15:00.440]  after giant midwestern earthquakes so the earth goes through cycles tectonically and to say that
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:05.400]  humans and their fracking is what's doing and is ridiculous now as for the big booms we've got an
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:13.720]  article going up with some research that was done by the intel hub from the la times decades ago
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:19.160]  about giant underground train projects and these nuclear powered locomotives and that's
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:23.320]  what i've said a lot of times this booming is associated with when they're hitting certain
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:29.400]  hard rock stratas underground and and the and the hums that are heard uh when they're building
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:33.320]  these giant underground facilities so that report just went up on info wars.com if you want to see
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:41.080]  that here's another one and this is out of uh the end of the american dream blog and they
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.440]  did some great research here and they link through to all the different factoids and
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:53.320]  government announcements here and and uh tectonic research from seismologists the ring of fire is
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:58.280]  roaring the life and there will be earthquakes of historic importance on the west coast of the
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:03.720]  united states does it seem to you like there's been an unusual amount of seismic activity
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:09.000]  around the world lately well it isn't just your imagination the ring of fire is roaring the life
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.440]  and there is really bad news for the west coast of the united states approximately 90 of all
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:20.520]  earthquakes and approximately 75 of all volcanic eruptions occur along the ring of fire
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.680]  we can show people on screen the ring of fire you can just look it up if you want to
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:32.600]  goes all the way around the pacific around australia around southeast asia china japan
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:41.880]  and over the pacific to the north down along alaska down the west coast of canada the west
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:48.760]  coast of the us right down central and south america down to chile that's why the indies
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:55.240]  because the andes have so many earthquakes there you can see that barrier reef of islands that
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:59.560]  come off alaska those are there from tectonic activity with the seafloor being driven up
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:05.720]  the ring of fire is roaring the life and that is really bad news for the west coast of the united
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:10.280]  states considering the fact that the entire west coast of the united states lies along the ring of
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:15.560]  fire we should be concerned that the ring of fire is becoming more active on wednesday the most
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:24.920]  powerful strike slip earthquake ever recorded happened along the ring of fire if that earthquake
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:30.520]  had happened in a major u.s. city along the west coast the city would have been entirely destroyed
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:34.440]  and they have a link to the documents proving that that's true we've just been total devastation
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:42.120]  scientists tell us that there is nearly a 100 chance and a certainty that the big one will
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:48.360]  hit california at some point in recent years we've seen japan chile indonesia and new zealand
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:53.640]  all get hit by historic earthquakes it is inevitable that there will be earthquakes of
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:18:00.040]  historic importance on the west coast of united states as well so far we have been very fortunate
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:06.600]  but the good fortune will not last indefinitely in a previous article they showed that earthquakes
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:13.800]  are becoming more frequent around the globe they have links to that data in 2001 there were 137
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:20.680]  earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater and in 2011 there were 205 the charts and data that are
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:25.960]  presented in the previous article show a clear upward trend in large global earthquakes just so
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:30.920]  happened to be hitting population centers most of the time over the past decade and that is why
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:37.800]  what happened this week is so alarming on wednesday a magnitude 8.6 earthquake struck off the coast
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:45.000]  of indonesia and that was rapidly followed by a magnitude 8.2 earthquake off the coast of indonesia
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:51.000]  fortunately those gigantic earthquakes did not produce the devastating tsunami but that doesn't
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:58.520]  mean that those earthquakes were not immensely powerful there are over 440 nuclear reactors
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:04.920]  of industrial use there's hundreds of experimental ones two of them in austin people say those don't

[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:42.440]  goes through the evidence that the big oil companies are supporting the carbon tax they're
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:47.560]  the ones pushing it their own by the big mega banks and again if you look at the featured news
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:53.160]  area of info wars dot com we have our video report up there info wars reporters harassed
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:58.600]  by cops for asking questions about chicken man and told that they couldn't enter the city council
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.000]  building we've got a new development on that with them joining us here in just a moment
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:12.600]  and then right here we've got a big story builder burg to pick romney's puppet mate
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:20.840]  and that is a big big deal there's more news on this today but this isn't just about
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:29.320]  outbuilder burg set to pick his running mate it's the fact that the washington post from the
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:38.200]  founding of builder burg back in 1954 and usterbeck holland with the dutch royalty and all the rest
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:46.040]  of them meeting there with the british royalty and the Rothschilds and the rockefellers the
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:51.000]  washington post has always had jane graham the founder of it owner of it or then her son there
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:56.040]  they they never would talk about it they were sworn to secrecy the only media at first allowed in
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:01.720]  there and now the washington post came out yesterday in an article in the loop shout at
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:07.800]  a dictator get some vp cred and they officially linked to the builder burg website that a few
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:13.080]  years ago was just nothing now they're going public and and that's what this is a coming out
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:18.120]  and they say yeah he ought to pick this certain person that's probably what builder burg would
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.200]  like you know a lot of people think builder burg is going to basically choose builder burg's been
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:28.440]  involved helping choose running mates before they say so now it before it didn't exist then when it
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:34.520]  did exist it didn't have power and now oh yeah it chooses it's like in europe where in multiple
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:39.880]  countries like greece and italy goldman sacks publicly appoints the presidents and prime ministers
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:46.840]  now and publicly says they've captured them but because it's not a foreign government or or you
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:53.720]  know well at least it's not a ruski or a or a chai calm it's all right to have bankers conquer us
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:56.680]  i mean we've got to get our mind around that that we've been conquered here
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:04.840]  and in the article they just mentioned oh yeah builder burg you know did put pressure on there
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:13.800]  to put john edwards in is that running mate 2004 of um senator carrie and builder burg does make a
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:18.120]  lot of decisions and well the question is you know builder burg kind of wants this person
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:24.040]  it's like a public communicate directly to mint romney a story in today's washington post written
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:30.840]  by veteran columnist al camman suggests that the builder burg group may have a decisive role to play
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:37.400]  in picking mint romney's running mate continuing a recent trend in which the secret of cabal has had
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:42.600]  a direct influence on u.s presidential approach but but that's only part of it why are they now
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:48.680]  admitting they have an influence through their house org in the washington post this is a big deal
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:54.760]  camman has been writing for the washington post for over three decades and also worked with
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:28:00.440]  watergate icons willward and bernstein suggesting the title of his column in the loop has some meaning
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:05.880]  behind it yeah he's saying i'm part of the establishment i've been told this and it's a
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:10.920]  message to folks that are in the loop camman remarks on how both president obama and hillary
[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:17.160]  clinton are heading to the summit of the americas this weekend in columbia to meet with over 30 other
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:23.640]  heads of state they will be joined by senator mark rubio of florida who has been talented as a potential
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:31.560]  vp having endorsement romney last month curiously not many senators seem to be going in fact it may
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:37.160]  be that the only one going through the senate foreign relations committee is mark rubio a possible
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:43.880]  vice presidential pick by the way jim tucker said well it was actually the mark anderson with him
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:47.480]  that they were looking at it could be at this meeting because he said they'll have builder
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:51.560]  burg steering meetings that aren't the official meeting but they'll get together and have piggyback
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:57.320]  meetings at these other global meetings she goes on to say a possible vice presidential pick who
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:02.760]  were told is flying commercial to attend writes camman adding that rubio's presence
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:07.560]  could help boost his foreign policy chops just as a visit with the clandestine builder
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:13.800]  burg group was key and john edwards being picked as john carrey's number two and oh four i thought
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:20.200]  it didn't exist i thought i was a crazy man i thought the new york times just four years ago
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:26.440]  had an article saying i was having hallucinations in virginia and imagining people following me
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:33.480]  yeah helicopters motorcades machine guns marines and plain clothes people trying to set us up police

[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:48.760]  two and a half acres or so he was legally raising chickens and he'd beaten them in court over and
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:55.080]  over again since 2008 and i was reading they couldn't get the local sheriff involved so somehow
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:01.480]  the feds were involved and there was an explosion and he's dead and yesterday darin mcbreen and our
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:06.840]  other great reporter and researcher marcos morales arrived there they arrived there the evening before
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:14.280]  and they went to the city hall that looks like it's a capital building or something it's so large
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:20.360]  and we're told by the police yelled at and told you you cannot and we have footage of this you
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:27.240]  cannot go in the city council building in it in broad daylight i think it was like noon
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:30.200]  timers so as they were on the show right after it happened and we have that high death footage
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:34.360]  they shot they're on the ground they're getting back tonight we'll have it for you on the radio
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:39.240]  slash tv and the nightly news on monday and the police first got in their face had turned
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:44.840]  your cameras off you're bad you're not real media and my guys are like first amendment we're just
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:50.360]  going inside very polite they said you're not allowed to go in the building well now there's
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:56.680]  been a new twist and and while darin was getting ready for this live feed from an iphone via skype
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:05.320]  there in roswell georgia the site of agenda 21 death and destruction as we document and
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:10.440]  chronicle agenda 21 green zoning because it was they were taking his land to make it a green zone
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.000]  and of course other land that they'd been taking this was just the tail and piece they needed
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:21.480]  but now it's not going to be a park they've announced they're deciding to just sell it to
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:26.840]  some friends of course that's how it works usually they don't even build the park they're like
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:31.240]  we're taking your neighbor's land for a park the neighbor's like oh i want that then later well
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.520]  where's my park you don't get that stupid we're going to build a high rise on it now but the point
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:43.480]  is the police said you can't go in the city council headquarters public building so i told
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:48.600]  them i said i want you to go back down there tomorrow and if you choose to violate their
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:54.440]  unlawful order and you choose to get arrested i will sue them i will pay to sue them but i said don't
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:36:01.000]  resist obviously and i said and don't go in if you don't want to get arrested well they backed
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.440]  off now as we were waiting to go live here during the last three minute break darin Mcbrane
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:12.840]  was standing in front of the city hall and two police cars pull up behind him so they're in the
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:18.360]  shot right now keeping an eye on the dangerous reporter but there's been a new twist and darin
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:25.080]  Mcbrane will tell us about that darin thank you for joining us sir well alex what a difference a
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:30.600]  day makes um you know yesterday like i said we were harassed we actually called the community
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:36.760]  relations spokesperson today her name is julie wreckbell and uh you know we told her that we
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:42.120]  would be returning to city hall today and asked her if you know we should expect harassment by the
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:47.560]  police basically uh today it's a different story you know they rolled out the welcome wagon she
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:55.000]  invited us into the building she even was gracious enough to participate in an interview but nobody
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:01.880]  is talking about the case of andrew worda's not a single person in fact we're even told that um
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:09.080]  you know the mayor um norm or uh what's his name jerry wood that he actually made a press conference
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:14.440]  i believe it was at worda's his funeral and that's the only public statement and he even informed
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:18.840]  the public at that time that this would be the last time and he's not going to talk to the public
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:25.800]  about this topic again oh really not gonna talk about the topic again that's what congressman
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:35.080]  weiner said early on yeah so so nobody's answering questions it's it's very odd um you know and you
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:39.800]  know when you when you rush up the steps with a microphone and a camera it's just strange you
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:45.160]  know yesterday to be surrounded by police you know it felt like one of those fictitious suburban
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:49.880]  towns in the twilight zone i would just i couldn't believe it but like i said today it's a different
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:53.960]  story it might have to do with the fact that we were told that there's nobody in the city council
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:57.880]  that's even here today the mayor's not here nobody's here so maybe it's because there's nobody
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:02.120]  no that's the twist they were all there marcos had gone in before you to make sure it was the right
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:07.800]  building and they're in the sprawling government complex uh feeding on the public and and and
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:13.000]  then she threw him out and said no just leave you try to come in they block you and then now
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:18.120]  today you were saying it was a ghost town in there so oh go ahead come on in now because you can't
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:23.720]  talk to anybody because you know they're all off playing golf or something yeah and you know and
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:28.520]  i think they're fully aware by now that that we are you know very knowledgeable of our rights
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:33.480]  you know so they know that we're not gonna be budged you know and i think that's important
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:38.520]  for everybody to know if if you know your rights you're protected but if you don't you know they
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:43.480]  will jump all over you i mean they will they will take advantage of that fact so it's really ruled by
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:50.200]  consent it is now now you've talked to more people trying to investigate mr. word is his death
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:55.960]  and again we have a report last night you follow the nightly news at gen 21 green kiss of death
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:02.120]  but what are we learning now about the way he died is there any further investigation
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.360]  i know there's conflicting news reports because nobody's talking now that some of the police refuse
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:15.080]  to take part uh in the uh in the raid against the evil chicken farmer you know i think the
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:20.280]  strangest thing is that we actually have more questions now than we did when we first got here
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:25.880]  you know it's just that nobody is talking you know there has been um some people that some police
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:30.440]  that have told us that they refused that they didn't want to participate but uh that they
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:35.800]  didn't want to talk on camera we're trying to get sheriff jackson we're trying to get his um uh you
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:40.440]  know what what he thinks about all this we're told that he might talk to us i talked to a secretary
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:45.720]  no phone calls back now i know you've tried to talk to some of the journalists and others what
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:50.920]  are locals saying do we do we know anything it's just the locals blows up when there's a raid
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:55.720]  and they say we we think he committed suicide and then we get there and they're acting all suspicious
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.960]  yeah i think the locals uh they from from what i've talked to the locals they feel that it was a
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:07.400]  suicide uh but they're you know they're just i think they're still in shock you know the guy was
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.680]  well loved in the community um you know the school children loved him uh you know he was friends
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:17.160]  with the mayor you know he borrowed the mayor's tractor to grade his own property because the city
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:23.720]  you know refused to maintain the uh the sewage and the um the drain uh you know why won't the
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.120]  why won't the mayor talk to you then because i know i mean i know reportedly he's not the king
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:32.680]  pen and all this and was friends with him so it's the code enforcement people you know over and over
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:38.440]  again it's like the mayor the police chief they just do whatever these bureaucrats tell them look the
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:45.480]  mayor issued an official press conference and like i said i believe it was uh at andrew warder's
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:50.520]  funeral and he informed the public that this is it this is the last time we're talking about this
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:56.360]  so any questions to the uh that the media has on this case they are just simply referring everyone
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:02.040]  to the mayor's official press conference which i haven't seen or read but uh i can assure you as
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.560]  soon as we get to a computer we'll check that out but they just they don't want to talk to anybody
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:10.920]  and it's not just in fours dot com it's all the rest of the media as well but uh obviously we're
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.320]  the only ones that are pressing the issue they just uh do their jobs by remaining silent
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:20.120]  darin let's expand on this uh because i know as soon as we disconnect from you you're gonna
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:26.600]  remember a bunch of stuff you wanted to cover uh but but but bottom line this is death by bureaucrat
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:33.560]  i mean are they saying now how he blew himself up or why they think he blew himself up or
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:38.680]  who was involved because i'm told feds were involved that the uh police department was
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:43.240]  involved that the sheriff wouldn't be involved that's in one news article other articles say
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:47.960]  the police wouldn't be involved and it was constables others say it was federal environmental
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:54.520]  police who raided the house we were told that it was county marshals that's it they were the only
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:42:01.080]  ones there was no police department so it was county marshals they did and this is not official
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:07.720]  but i've also heard reports that they did find a detonation device would appear to be a detonation
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:13.640]  device inside the house we videotaped and took pictures of an empty gasoline can that was actually
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:18.600]  charred and burned right outside the home found some uh rubber gloves and there was a uh police
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:22.280]  line you know around the house do not enter but we're able to get our cameras and kind of look
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:28.680]  inside i think i told you yesterday inside the property was it looked much more devastating
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:32.600]  on the inside than it did the outside you could see damage you could see the burn from the outside
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:38.840]  but inside is completely gutted um and burnt to well i've got news camera footage from squad cars
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:45.240]  across the country where they'll get into somebody's rv and go look we found pipe bomb parts
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:51.720]  and they'll hold up jumper cables um that happened in a case of a fellow i actually personally know
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:56.120]  and had the squad car footage and the helicopter footage but but later in the trial the squad car
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:02.520]  footage and he gets out uh what ferrule montgomery's his name there's actually a clip of it in road
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:09.720]  to tyranny and is it road to tyranny or is it masters of terror i forget the point is he gets out
[02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:15.720]  of his little rv they taser aim they let the police dog bite him for no reason and then they
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:20.760]  go on the news and say we're arresting him for a pipe bomb and they hold up jumper cables and
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:24.760]  then later they had to drop it and it's like you know who knows yes the thing when government
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:29.880]  lies this much i don't know if i believe anything they say darin it's like nasa says they've
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:36.920]  99 percent proven martian bacteria uh in the samples from the viking spacecraft
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:41.800]  that landed there in in in 76 i don't know if that's true i mean you can't believe anything they say
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:48.920]  well the the strangest thing too we have a community spokesperson who isn't speaking i mean
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:54.040]  you know she talked to us she invited to send today yesterday she sent the police assurance
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:58.600]  but today you know we're invited in but still none of our questions were answered did you
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:05.160]  ask her why she sent the police after you yesterday yes she said she did not she did not so and she
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:10.840]  she also said today that it was wrong for them to tell us to leave um you know so today she's on our
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:18.040]  side yesterday it was a twilight zone well again i want to ask police something in these bureaucrats
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:23.160]  do you really want your kids growing up in a country like this where where where journalists show up
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:29.080]  in suits and ties and are walking up and police jump out and yell at them and say you can't go in
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:36.920]  the city hall i mean that is an unlawful thing they did and this is happening everywhere
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:42.200]  and i gave the analogy yesterday darin i want your take on this it'd be like if you owned a
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:48.680]  bass boat with your neighbor and you're out on the bass boat and you know the neighbor happens
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:53.320]  to be a cop and they shoot a hole in the bottom of the boat and say aha i'm sinking your boat you're
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:57.480]  like but it's your boat too you're in it too i mean when you butcher the bill of rights and
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:45:01.160]  constitution that you swear and those are protecting the fin by the way there's a reason that's where
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:07.320]  oaths too you're destroying your own future and then there's all these excuses of oh that's the
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:13.240]  way it is and and and of course they they demoralize the police because it is a thankless horrible
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:18.200]  job i mean you couldn't pay me a five hundred thousand dollars to do it uh and i know some cops now
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:24.120]  pay over a hundred thousand dollars in many areas but still i mean it after a while it sounds but
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:30.680]  so i mean look this country didn't used to have police you had sheriffs and others for serious
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:35.640]  crimes or to get warrants after a crime was committed to bring somebody to justice now you
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:40.520]  got everybody calling the police on each other if they're dog poops in their yard you know that's
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:46.360]  not what police are for darren or if you have too many chickens but we don't know if that's true
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.720]  you know they claimed that uh one of andrew's neighbors did not like his number of chickens
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:57.000]  and you know it's just silly i mean andrew we've seen his property he kept it up to code um you
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:03.240]  know the place looked great and and from what we understand he was actually the official on raising
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:10.360]  chickens he would teach other people how to do it but uh according to the um you know city hall here
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:17.320]  someone complained and then he had oh god forbid he had too many chickens on his property well he's
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:22.680]  dead now so they've uh must feel good about themselves and he dared to borrow a tractor
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:27.160]  from the mayor and grade his own property to protect his property from flooding
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:32.760]  you know my grandfather had a heart attack that ended up basically killing him a few years later
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:36.680]  might as well have been dead because the heart attack and then the heart surgery and then the
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:42.280]  stroke it caused but i remember he was getting these two thousand dollar a day fines because they
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:47.480]  they've got actuaries in awesome where they only hit old people i've noticed uh and because i was
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:52.120]  doing these stories myself and they didn't have cable but they heard from the neighbor about my
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:55.880]  story and my grandfather's like in a little blue collar area south awesome my grandmother still
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:01.720]  lives there he goes my mom's dad he goes alex i'm getting these two thousand dollar a day fines they
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:07.720]  say i've got to clean out the creek but he goes here's my property line and the city is and of
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:14.600]  course he was smart and informed unlike most people uh who they prey on he goes he goes can you do
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:19.240]  something about this or do i go to the city council because that's not my property that's a drainage
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:25.720]  ditch off the road and i'm not supposed to keep that clear the city is and i said well sure i'll
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:32.040]  do something about it and uh but i left that day it was a sunday i should go there and eat sunday
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:37.400]  evenings eat dinner with my grandparents and i watched 60 minutes with him and a few days later uh
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:44.120]  a few days later i go yeah i'm gonna just hire a company to come do it it's quicker and fight in
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:47.640]  the city and she's like my grandmother's like oh he's already been out there all day you know he's
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:52.360]  like 70 something years old a little bit overweight and stuff uh he's been out there all day cleaning
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:55.960]  out all the brush and stuff that had gotten in there that the code enforcers were telling him he
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:59.960]  had to clean that wasn't even his brush and then a couple days later he had a heart attack and i
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:04.280]  think that's part of it probably broke some you know plaque loose and did that but that's how they
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.080]  operate and that's that's that's what they do and i saw him give them people two thousand dollar
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:13.800]  day fines for three inch crash and it was always when somebody wanted their property we'd find it
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:18.520]  was always cancer patients people like that so i just went to show the city council people with
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:23.960]  with three foot grass in the city and demanded they have criminal charges on them was actually
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:28.840]  told that by a police officer because the police started giving me all the data on the city council
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:33.320]  people who had who had code violations because they didn't like going oh because that was the thing
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:39.640]  they were ordered with rolling deling sin to go arrest him uh because he hadn't paid the fines
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:46.280]  anyway side issue anything else mcbrain no and like i said alex you know it's just very tragic
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:51.400]  and we were left here with more questions than we even began with uh there's some very shady
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:56.040]  dealings in the background going on with the foreclosure you know we're going to look more into
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:49:01.160]  that uh very suspicious uh you know things going on there so we're trying to talk to his attorney
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:05.720]  who was helping him with the try to fight the foreclosure so maybe we'll have an update on you on
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.920]  that you know you know darin i was thinking this afternoon thank you darin i was thinking earlier
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:16.040]  that maybe it was a smaller town it was like a little city council that maybe they closed sometimes
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:21.240]  that looks like the tennessee capital or something this must be a really big town
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:26.120]  and with giant steps leading up to it and they were telling you you couldn't go in that public
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:32.600]  mausoleum well it's it's uh what is it what 40 minute drive from atlanta but you know there's
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:36.840]  you you really can't tell i mean it at least seems like a big town to me so
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:43.400]  but um well i mean that looks like a bigger city council than austin has that's a gigantic building
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:49.560]  it's pretty big hey can you have a building okay can you have more can you have marcos pan and show

[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:50.360]  hello alex hi um i i have personally known about the establishment since i was seven years old
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:56.280]  because they used to test on me with their drugs and i actually was compliant about about it until
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:01.960]  2003 when i wanted to fight back because the state of new york wanted to take my son away from me
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:12.760]  because of my mental illness so i filed a petition in my county court um and my ex-husband's wife
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:19.320]  counter petitioned me and ended up winning with the power of attorney and she signed
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:26.360]  the his name my ex-husband's name so neither me or my ex-husband ever uh signed the adoption
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:33.320]  paperwork so the adoption is only signed by her yeah well there's all sorts of stuff out there
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:37.960]  like that that doesn't sound like that's legal or lawful thank you so much for the call another
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:44.440]  terrible story there as society degenerates and disintegrates and it really is everybody knows

[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:55.800]  not a christian i just mean we've got to recognize good from evil i mean come on thomas in kansas
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:00.920]  you're on the air welcome hey alex uh what's going on man worldwide transmission
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:07.640]  longtime listener thanks for taking my call uh i was actually at work yesterday and i picked up
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:15.000]  the kansas city star and there was on the front page actually it was an article on how uh the
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:24.040]  department of justice is suing uh apple for uh i don't know conspiring with publishers for
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:29.160]  uh making their ebooks at a higher price what is he legal about that
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:37.000]  well that's what they always do i did see the uh justice department that's like having b lz bub
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:42.840]  go after a smaller demon i did see where they're going after apple uh for trying to work with
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:49.560]  distributors to have a higher price uh amazon you know basically acts like walmart and drives down
[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:55.240]  the price which actually just destroys publishers and smaller companies and makes them huge profits
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:00.920]  it's all part of monopolies i'm no fan of apple and its overall business practices uh but uh
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:07.800]  i don't think that's illegal but it i'm not an antitrust expert uh but but in general terms
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:12.280]  they're always going into some little petty thing to act like they're doing something
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:19.400]  while ignoring the larger big crimes well the interesting thing is is uh you know it was
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:26.440]  headed up by eric holder and it's just amazing to me that he would just like you say do something
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:32.600]  petty like this which isn't petty for apple but you know this is what creates like the lobbying
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:37.720]  for you know corporations is just throw a bunch of money in government to get them to leave them
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:44.280]  alone sure but uh refreshing my memory i think it was apple and kindle being sued for working
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:49.880]  together to drive down the price you're saying was to drive up the price well apple here's what
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:57.400]  the article said article basically said that okay uh department of justice was accusing apple and the
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:04.360]  publishers of conspiring together of uh driving up the price of ebooks because publishers wanted
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:11.800]  more money for ebooks and so they were going to drop their ebooks for amazon and just go with uh
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:16.760]  with apple yeah that makes sense i you know i scanned over the article and it just it's not
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:22.360]  that important to me in the larger scheme because it's it's like polishing well a polishing and you
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:27.960]  know what it just in the final equation it really doesn't matter i mean the justice department is a
[02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:34.440]  joke and it it only puts on appearances that is trying to stop crime and things like that
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:47.080]  okay another hour coming up straight ahead stay with us thank you for listening to gcm visit gcm

[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:33.480]  john you're on the air hey alex hey buddy this is john here in austin texas i talked to you
[03:01:33.480 --> 03:01:38.600]  after listening to you for so many years i'm not telling you anything today uh i will let you
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:44.200]  know that i heard something the other day through an apd police officer about the
[03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:50.520]  walmart shooting of the cop that walmart has a policy about their employees not putting
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:56.200]  hands on any customers and the two people who wrestled the guy to the ground are apparently
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:04.600]  being fired from walmart you're kidding this is what i understand i i i work in a convenience store
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:12.120]  and i i got this bit of conversation from the cashier talking to the uh to a police officer
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:18.520]  who came in the store and he was not pleased about it apparently walmart has issued i guess
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:23.000]  the opposite of a press release to the police department i guess the press unreleased tell
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:28.840]  them not to talk about it i figure i tell you because you got a crew of reporters and you
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:32.440]  might know a guy on the inside of the police department to like get to the bottom of it
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:38.200]  i'm blown away by it i tell you what we don't ever really use this anymore because so many
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:43.560]  thousands of people called it and and and a lot of it wasn't serious but what would happen is
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:49.400]  some crazy people would leave like 500 messages a day um do we still check that comment line
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:58.760]  guys okay this comment line is only for police officers to call and to confirm or deny what what
[03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:02.280]  that gentleman's saying but it's part of the nanny state where kids can't play dodgeball
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:08.440]  where you can't run at school where you can't spank your kids so the whole society degenerates if
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:13.160]  it's true because they're trying to train the public not to help each other anybody else that
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:17.960]  walmart is going to fire the two employees that tackled the guy that had the gun that's because
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:22.200]  they don't want any liability they'd rather by just get killed and say well we we have nothing to do
[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:26.840]  with it just amazing because i know that is their policy they say don't uh don't defend yourself
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:33.480]  it's like in school they say let a bully beat you up we'll do their own horn by by by patting
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:39.080]  themselves in the back because they gave the officer's family 50 grand uh but they apparently are
[03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:43.000]  putting that the two employees are on that's another point instead of shutting the whole
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:49.880]  city down for a five hour uh parade down i-35 and the rest of it why didn't they just give the money
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:55.960]  of the tens of thousands of dollars that that cost or a lot more to the family i mean why why make
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:04:01.160]  this giant spectacle i mean and they just get bigger and bigger every time stuff happens i'll
[03:04:01.160 --> 03:04:06.920]  have to look into that here's the comment line five one two six four six four four four but
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:12.920]  you're in austin obviously no five one two six four six four four four four six four six four four
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:18.280]  four four and i'll i'll also bring that up sunday because that's important so he told you matter
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:23.480]  of factly not that he heard it but that it was definitely a fact that that that they were talking
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:30.600]  about firing those employees and then here's the here's the kicker she used to work at walmart and
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:35.080]  she said that that's their policy that is you can't because you know walmart doesn't prosecute
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:40.200]  people for stealing less than 25 or 50 with a merchandise so they have this policy where you
[03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:48.920]  can't grab somebody a parent anyhow uh i know i'm just dumbfounded about what you're saying and i
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:53.400]  was thinking about but it's okay for them to own slave camps with little kids making the products
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:04:57.080]  well you all the products now they find have blood on them and the little bitty fingers
[03:04:57.080 --> 03:05:06.600]  rule bleeding
