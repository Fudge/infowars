[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:30.760]  Texas Alex Jones we are live it is the 19th day of February 2009 on this
[00:30.760 --> 00:35.520]  Thursday edition important broadcast lined up for you today Alan Watt of
[00:35.520 --> 00:40.920]  cutting the matrix joins us in one hour then Bob Daisy in studio to go over the
[00:40.920 --> 00:45.120]  media lies and propaganda and the way they program the population and is the
[00:45.120 --> 00:49.680]  population breaking free from the false reality that the control corporate
[00:49.680 --> 00:55.320]  press is so carefully woven as we punch more and more holes in that iron curtain
[00:55.320 --> 00:59.440]  of disinformation and then joining us via video cam will be live at prism
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.320]  planet TV in the second third hour and fourth hour micro vero from Hawaii will
[01:05.320 --> 01:12.200]  be joining us as well to cover the important news of the day just novelty
[01:12.200 --> 01:18.440]  here there was a viral video on the web a few days ago of someone opening up one
[01:18.440 --> 01:23.880]  of the digital TV converters put out by Magnavox and saying that there was a
[01:23.880 --> 01:29.080]  hidden camera and microphone in it well we went out and bought the very same
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.280]  model and opened it up and it does not have a microphone or camera in it now
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.000]  we can say that maybe this guy who put this video out maybe he did have a
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.240]  camera and microphone in in his Magnavox digital TV converter but we have some
[01:46.240 --> 01:50.480]  engineers here to greet engineers and they looked at what was supposedly the
[01:50.480 --> 01:53.760]  camera and microphone and said it looked like he'd been stuck on there and was
[01:53.760 --> 01:57.160]  not connected to any real circuitry because all the circuitry was the same
[01:57.160 --> 02:01.000]  we know what the circuitry does and the camera was not connected to the right
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.560]  type of circuitry so it appears to be a hoax or alive on prison planet dot TV
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.120]  or the end of the show I'm gonna show you the TV converter box that we opened up
[02:10.120 --> 02:15.720]  and dug into and documented that's a hoax because not only do we try to expose
[02:15.720 --> 02:20.800]  the mainstream media when they spin or live or have an agenda it's just as
[02:20.800 --> 02:24.680]  important that we try to keep the alternative media to a high standard as
[02:24.680 --> 02:29.200]  well and you can call the alternative media somebody just posting something on
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.800]  YouTube this will do a greatness service there have been a lot of hoax videos
[02:34.800 --> 02:40.160]  put out of worms supposedly coming out of pork chops of Trichinosis worms now
[02:40.160 --> 02:44.920]  in truth brain worms have been killing more than a hundred people a year here
[02:44.920 --> 02:49.200]  in the United States and in some cases there are live parasites that attack
[02:49.200 --> 02:57.200]  the brain that surgeons have to remove in pork but by people staging events it
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.760]  then discredits that fact Google announced three years ago that they have
[03:02.760 --> 03:06.800]  software and have a patent to use the onboard microphone and cameras that are
[03:06.800 --> 03:11.800]  built into almost all new computers to have AI software keyword software
[03:11.800 --> 03:16.440]  record what's going on in your home and then tailor Google ads to your
[03:16.440 --> 03:21.480]  computer screen that is real that is happening Tivo admits and admitted to
[03:21.480 --> 03:25.640]  the Chicago Tribune that they track what you watch and what you do and build
[03:25.640 --> 03:28.960]  psychological algorithms the first time they got caught doing this is when they
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.720]  bragged themselves at the Super Bowl a few years ago when Janet Jackson had the
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.360]  wardrobe malfunction and they bragged oh we had over two million rewines and
[03:38.360 --> 03:43.160]  replays and people said well how do you know that well the Tivo box is two way
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.200]  so you are being tracked and traced that way and there are microphones and
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.960]  cameras on computers being used being accessed by the FBI being accessed by
[03:52.960 --> 03:58.680]  Google under their own admissions on record so it discredits that serious
[03:58.680 --> 04:04.320]  issue that people need to be made aware of when people are staging hoaxes with
[04:04.320 --> 04:11.040]  other devices like Magnavox digital TV converter that does not have a camera or
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.440]  microphone in it so we'll do a report on that coming up near the end of the show
[04:17.440 --> 04:25.880]  today also in other news Ashcroft says Obama Bush detainee policies are
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.680]  exactly the same well we don't need Ashcroft the former Attorney General to
[04:29.680 --> 04:33.080]  tell us that we reported weeks ago when he signed that executive order and said
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.120]  that he was looking at shutting down Guantanamo Bay that in reality he was
[04:38.120 --> 04:42.240]  saying that they were gonna continue secret arrest what the LA Times called
[04:42.240 --> 04:48.000]  rendition they said that rendition is abduction and a lot more the EPA is

[08:30.400 --> 08:34.080]  has nothing to do with all the serious environmental problems we have like the
[08:34.080 --> 08:38.200]  cross species genetic engineering the terminator seeds with what the big
[08:38.200 --> 08:42.600]  aggro companies are doing the clear-cutting of rainforest the toxic
[08:42.600 --> 08:46.920]  waste dumping in the oceans the use of the plurianium worldwide no none of that
[08:46.920 --> 08:51.120]  matters school children are all taught that it's carbon dioxide part of the
[08:51.120 --> 08:57.360]  life cycle part of the carbon cycle sunlight water oxygen carbon dioxide
[08:57.360 --> 09:01.680]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe they put off oxygen that we breathe it is not
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.720]  a toxic waste and we've heard multiple senators in the White House say they are
[09:06.720 --> 09:12.960]  preparing for carbon taxes carbon taxes on your cattle carbon taxes where
[09:12.960 --> 09:17.000]  they're being produced carbon taxes when you eat beef carbon taxes when you eat
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.200]  chicken carbon taxes on your home carbon taxes on every facet of your life
[09:22.200 --> 09:26.800]  for social engineering as Time Magazine has said in an article titled the New
[09:26.800 --> 09:30.560]  World Order the very banks that have imploded the world economy are now going
[09:30.560 --> 09:35.120]  to set up a bank of the world that micromanages and controls the United
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.000]  States and the rest of the planet and you will pay your taxes to the new world
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.480]  bank this is open world government after decades of denying they were setting
[09:44.480 --> 09:47.760]  this up and we would read their documents on air they now admit it
[09:47.760 --> 09:51.520]  they're now throwing down the gauntlet in your face so that's coming up also
[09:51.520 --> 09:55.120]  Illinois bill would require gun owners to buy one million dollars in liability
[09:55.120 --> 09:58.560]  insurance and they're trying to pass similar laws around the country this is
[09:58.560 --> 10:02.400]  how they're going after the Second Amendment and victim disarmament what
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.360]  do you expect from the mafia that runs Illinois do you think mafia wants their
[10:06.360 --> 10:10.120]  slaves armed first gun laws were against Native Americans and blacks in this
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.520]  country people that the government is oppressing need to be disarmed and now
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.920]  we're all being oppressed Oklahoma City officer pulls man over for anti Obama's
[10:19.920 --> 10:23.960]  sign on his vehicle confiscated the sign and the Secret Service visited him
[10:23.960 --> 10:29.360]  demanded to be let in his house to quote make sure that he was not part of any
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.960]  hate groups the sign and whether you agree with it or not it's his first
[10:33.960 --> 10:38.440]  amendment was abort Obama not babies and you know they say abort a mission
[10:38.440 --> 10:42.640]  clearly you don't abort a full grown person and the police chief we are
[10:42.640 --> 10:47.240]  ordered to sign to be given back and apologize but this shows the new secret
[10:47.240 --> 10:51.880]  police mentality in the United States and I remember in Missouri during the
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.600]  campaign I hadn't weighed in for McCain or Obama because I know both parties are
[10:57.600 --> 11:02.160]  controlled by the same banking institutions I remember hearing rumors
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.720]  that in Connecticut and in Missouri and Illinois that if you were criticizing
[11:06.720 --> 11:10.000]  Obama the police would threaten to arrest you or would arrest you then it
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.240]  started coming out in mainstream news and police went on TV and said if you
[11:13.240 --> 11:17.520]  talk bad about Obama we're going to arrest you I said that sounds like
[11:17.520 --> 11:23.640]  Nazi Germany and if anybody had any questions about whether Obama was a
[11:23.640 --> 11:29.360]  carefully packaged corporate fraud now we know the the evidence is in you know
[11:29.360 --> 11:35.240]  he lies and says I will always make sure Congress waits five days before a bill
[11:35.240 --> 11:41.240]  is passed so we have a chance to read it then he spearheaded with Bush in tandem
[11:41.240 --> 11:44.840]  and the Democrats give him credit for this to make sure back on October 3rd of
[11:44.840 --> 11:48.640]  last year when he was you know candidate Obama and he pressured the Black
[11:48.640 --> 11:53.000]  Caucus and others to pass the bill unread the banker takeover bill now
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.200]  Bloomberg reports 9.7 trillion stolen offshore banks then last week he said
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.240]  you must pass the $787 million stimulus package of corporate welfare and
[12:04.240 --> 12:08.880]  federalization of the states he said you must pass it there's no time to read it
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.760]  Congress was not allowed to read the bill in its final form and Obama then
[12:13.760 --> 12:17.840]  promptly said I'm taking a four-day vacation and left and signed the bill
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.280]  five days later why did he say rush it through it's desperate we'll have a
[12:22.280 --> 12:27.320]  depression we'll have a crisis to catastrophe if it's not signed now and
[12:27.320 --> 12:29.640]  Democrats and Republicans said but we've got to have time to read it the
[12:29.640 --> 12:33.840]  public has time to see it you said he said no we I have to sign it the minute
[12:33.840 --> 12:37.640]  it's passed or we'll have a depression and then he said hey I'm going to Chicago
[12:37.640 --> 12:42.880]  for vacation I'll sign it next week in Denver no hurry just like the Patriot Act
[12:42.880 --> 12:46.080]  and George Bush no one had a chance to read it it had to be passed right now or
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.240]  the terrorists were going to kill us the bill has to be passed now we're going to
[12:49.240 --> 12:53.920]  have a depression this is so no one can read it and now we find out it is the
[12:53.920 --> 12:58.720]  greatest pork barrel and corporate welfare ever seen and the leadership of
[12:58.720 --> 13:04.320]  both parties were behind it and that's the issue here it's not about left and
[13:04.320 --> 13:08.880]  right it's about bringing accountability back to government take the first banker
[13:08.880 --> 13:17.040]  take over bill in 2008 polls showed 98 percent against the bill Congress on
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.040]  record so they were getting a thousand to one phone calls against it but the
[13:21.040 --> 13:25.720]  leadership of both parties rammed that bill through and on the day before they
[13:25.720 --> 13:29.400]  passed it on October 2nd the Congress refused to pass it Democrats and
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.640]  Republicans alike and so the White House sent Secretary of the Treasury Paulson
[13:33.640 --> 13:38.640]  and Fed Chairman of the private Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke to this is on record
[13:38.640 --> 13:45.160]  they reported it Senator Inhofe and other members of Congress on record went
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.560]  there and said we have been threatened with physical martial law if we don't
[13:50.560 --> 13:59.280]  pass this bill so we'll continue to cover that information as well today also
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.240]  body scanners replace metal detectors and try out at Tulsa Airport these are
[14:03.240 --> 14:07.680]  going in airports all over the country it scans a naked image of your body
[14:07.680 --> 14:14.760]  everything your breast your genitals it is a better photograph than even 35
[14:14.760 --> 14:20.880]  millimeter why because it even scans your pores the the the the resolution and
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.520]  they store the 360 image the biometric image of your naked body there what is
[14:26.520 --> 14:30.160]  the secret weapon that in his last book Bob Woodward is talking about they're
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.040]  using an Iraq the same system they can biometrically scan somebody on the
[14:34.040 --> 14:38.600]  street their walk their gate even the shadow they cast and how they walk from
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.120]  above then that's fed into defense department satellites and that's why
[14:43.120 --> 14:46.280]  they want to get scans of Americans because the Pentagon admits they're
[14:46.280 --> 14:49.280]  using this system here in the United States and worldwide so they can track
[14:49.280 --> 14:54.720]  and trace everyone everywhere they go so we'll be getting into that report as
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.520]  well you know last night I was doing one of the final voiceovers for the Obama
[14:59.520 --> 15:04.360]  deception the new film I'm making and I wrote this little piece and I thought
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.800]  that I would read this on air this voiceover as part of the banking section
[15:08.800 --> 15:14.280]  of the film because I think it concisely breaks down the history of the
[15:14.280 --> 15:17.680]  banking cartel the Anglo-American establishment and exactly what we're
[15:17.680 --> 15:24.840]  facing today so that's also coming up later in the broadcast today some of the
[15:24.840 --> 15:31.880]  other news drug violence spends Mexico towards civil war CNN do you remember
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.680]  six years ago we began warning that the State Department reported Mexico was
[15:37.680 --> 15:41.280]  the most dangerous country in the world more dangerous per capita than the West
[15:41.280 --> 15:47.160]  Bank and the Gaza Strip in Palestine in Israel we were called extremists called
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.680]  Cougs I'm in Texas I would read about the rocket attacks in South Texas
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.440]  murders in one day 50 plus Americans kidnapping taken over the border for
[15:56.440 --> 16:03.600]  ransom now the capital of kidnapping in North America is not Mexico City it's
[16:03.600 --> 16:07.720]  now Phoenix Arizona this is mainstream news but we were reported on this years
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.920]  ago we laughed at truck bombs going off car bombs going off in Texas attacks
[16:12.920 --> 16:20.200]  hang grenade attacks on newspapers in South Texas as these criminal drug gangs
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.560]  because of the prohibition of drugs it makes the price rise just like in the
[16:24.560 --> 16:29.840]  20s the prohibition here and because of that the $400 billion a year industry
[16:29.840 --> 16:33.680]  between Mexico the United States with heroin and cocaine is causing these
[16:33.680 --> 16:38.720]  drug gangs to literally bring Mexico to its knees constantly government
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.160]  officials at the highest levels cabinet level in Mexico are caught making
[16:42.160 --> 16:46.920]  billions of dollars drug dealing and they're waging war with other cartels
[16:46.920 --> 16:54.000]  that aren't paying their cut into the western central banks and so now Mexico
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.600]  is on the verge of collapse just last week the El Paso Times reported that
[17:00.600 --> 17:06.520]  FEMA camps are being built for an influx of Mexicans in Mexico collapses that
[17:06.520 --> 17:10.160]  Homeland Security is preparing to federalize the southwestern states
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.680]  doing this collapse they could legalize drugs or decriminalize them
[17:14.680 --> 17:20.480]  instantly every study shows this would all disappear like phantoms at the break
[17:20.480 --> 17:24.400]  of dawn but don't hold your breath that's not gonna happen because Western
[17:24.400 --> 17:29.120]  banks are addicted to laundering the $400 billion a year that through
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.520]  fractional reserve banking they're able to leverage 10 times and then they
[17:34.520 --> 17:38.720]  leverage it again 10 times for the power of infinity and that's what all these
[17:38.720 --> 17:42.920]  fiat derivatives are about this drug war is one of the biggest reasons this
[17:42.920 --> 17:48.560]  nation is now collapsing to the money power Zabignir Brzezinski doesn't just
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.600]  fear trilateral Commission founder national security advisor Jimmy Carter
[17:52.600 --> 17:59.000]  now top advisor to Barack Obama the man who bragged that he funded Pol Pot in
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.560]  the murder of three million people Brzezinski fears class warfare and
[18:04.560 --> 18:10.440]  destruction of the New World Order that is a quote he was on MSNBC yesterday
[18:10.440 --> 18:14.440]  we're gonna play a clip of this later and he says oh he's so concerned oh he's
[18:14.440 --> 18:18.880]  so upset that America is gonna probably collapse into civil war oh it's so
[18:18.880 --> 18:25.320]  upsetting is that why they started North com covertly in 1979 under FEMA under
[18:25.320 --> 18:30.680]  Zabignir Brzezinski and then publicly founded it in 2002 is that why everything
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.160]  the bankers have done to build the FEMA camps to covertly federalize police and
[18:34.160 --> 18:38.880]  build their secret FEMA army now publicly announced 20,000 combat army
[18:38.880 --> 18:41.800]  trips to be used against the American people and according to the John War
[18:41.800 --> 18:45.720]  Defense Authorization Act and Presidential Decision Directive 51
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.680]  federalize the states and remove governors if they do not follow the
[18:50.680 --> 18:54.880]  orders of the feds saying that governors are now dual-headed federal officers
[18:54.880 --> 19:03.120]  this outdoes even what happened during reconstruction after the Civil War this
[19:03.120 --> 19:08.800]  is a paramilitary takeover you know he was the most highly decorated person
[19:08.800 --> 19:14.080]  in U.S. military history he was in line to be the common down in the Marine
[19:14.080 --> 19:17.840]  Corps Smedley Butler and he wrote the book war is a racket but why do you
[19:17.840 --> 19:21.720]  write that book two-time congressional Medal of Honor winner he wrote that book
[19:21.720 --> 19:27.120]  because after overthrowing more than 23rd World Nations leading the Marines he
[19:27.120 --> 19:32.080]  was approached by Prescott Bush and the Haramans as Nazi agents this is New York
[19:32.080 --> 19:35.840]  Times mainstream news back in the 50s they had the McCormick-Dickstein
[19:35.840 --> 19:39.700]  committee hearings but during the 1930s they approached the commandant who
[19:39.700 --> 19:43.760]  might be the common Marine Corps and said we want you to lead 500,000 men in
[19:43.760 --> 19:47.760]  the overthrow of the United States he became part of the plot just long enough
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.560]  to expose it and then they actually arrested some of the people but Prescott
[19:52.560 --> 19:56.680]  Bush was too big to arrest well they've done it now the Marines and the army are
[19:56.680 --> 20:03.200]  standing by for total physical martial law in the United States it's a new year

[24:17.640 --> 24:26.520]  me go ahead and get into this little voiceover from the Obama deception film
[24:26.520 --> 24:31.520]  that's going to be done in about a week the banking cartel had established a
[24:31.520 --> 24:36.440]  beachhead in 1913 for the Federal Reserve Act in 1947 they set up a
[24:36.440 --> 24:40.400]  parallel shadow government with the National Security Act from 47 on the
[24:40.400 --> 24:44.440]  national security state began the long process of absorbing federal and state
[24:44.440 --> 24:48.240]  bureaucracies all at the same time undermining the constitutional power of
[24:48.240 --> 24:52.400]  Congress and dominating the executive branch by controlling the issuance of
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.280]  currency and credit the private Federal Reserve was able to buy up most of the
[24:56.280 --> 25:00.600]  fortune 500 and if a company wouldn't sell the bankers would unleash federal
[25:00.600 --> 25:05.400]  regulators to run the amount of business private central banks in Europe the
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.120]  United States in England took taxpayer money and loaned it over 30% interest to
[25:10.120 --> 25:13.360]  Third World Nations the bankers would then bribe the leaders of these
[25:13.360 --> 25:17.440]  countries not to pay back the loans their Third World Poverts would sign
[25:17.440 --> 25:21.040]  agreements with the bankers stating that when the country defaulted the banks
[25:21.040 --> 25:24.800]  would be given all the natural resources and infrastructure of the one sovereign
[25:24.800 --> 25:29.400]  lands but worst of all the countries would pledge future taxes paid by the
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.040]  people in perpetuity as profit to the private banks by the year 2000 there
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.040]  were few nations that had not fallen to the designs of the money power the
[25:39.040 --> 25:42.320]  globalists were now ready to start their final phase of the world government
[25:42.320 --> 25:46.640]  takeover the destruction of the Western nation's economies to do that they
[25:46.640 --> 25:52.280]  first removed banking regulations like the Glass-Steagall Act this allowed
[25:52.280 --> 25:55.680]  their front companies to issue unlimited credit to the world and to set up
[25:55.680 --> 25:59.520]  giant Ponzi schemes the scams were advertised by the controlled corporate
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.360]  media as completely legitimate and the thing to invest in because of the
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.720]  fantastic returns private investors corporations state and local governments
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.640]  invested heavily they had taken the bait hook line and sinker then in late
[26:13.640 --> 26:18.160]  2007 the bankers themselves began to bad mouth the scams that they had created
[26:18.160 --> 26:22.640]  to destroy confidence next the central banks cut off the tsunami of fiat money
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.520]  that they were using to pump up the bubble when Congress and the public
[26:26.520 --> 26:31.520]  refused to write the finance oligarchs blank check the bankers began to engage
[26:31.520 --> 26:34.960]  in financial terrorism saying that the world would go into another great
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.320]  depression further destroying confidence by design the stock market and then
[26:39.320 --> 26:43.800]  plunged but even that wasn't enough to force Congress to capitulate to the
[26:43.800 --> 26:48.120]  offshore banks senator in half of Oklahoma and congressman Brad Sherman of
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.360]  California and others told the world that the entire Congress had been
[26:52.360 --> 26:55.680]  threatened with martial law by the White House and the Treasury Department if
[26:55.680 --> 26:59.960]  they didn't pass the so-called banker bailout bill the final version of the
[26:59.960 --> 27:03.680]  bill was kept secret from the Congress until minutes before the vote on
[27:03.680 --> 27:08.960]  October 3rd 2008 the Federal Reserve had promised total transparency that every
[27:08.960 --> 27:12.440]  dime would be accounted for after passage the public learned with horror
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.800]  that the bill was really a financial coup d'etat by wall street the bill
[27:16.800 --> 27:21.840]  didn't just give 700 billion dollars to the banks it was a blank check and as of
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.480]  February 2009 Bloomberg and AP report 9.7 trillion had disappeared into a
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.320]  black hole and the bill stated that by law no branch of government agency or
[27:32.320 --> 27:37.280]  court could even review what the banks do with the money it reads decisions by
[27:37.280 --> 27:41.480]  the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act are non-reviewable and
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.000]  committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.160]  by any administrative agency within 24 hours of its passage secretary of
[27:51.160 --> 27:54.400]  treasury Henry Paulson said that they were no longer going to use the money
[27:54.400 --> 27:58.800]  to unfreeze the mortgage market by buying a bad debt he went on to say that
[27:58.800 --> 28:03.200]  there that where the money went was a secret throughout its passage president
[28:03.200 --> 28:07.120]  bush and senator obama worked in tandem to get congress to pass the bill
[28:07.120 --> 28:10.960]  without even having time to read it despite the fact that in major polls
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.320]  98% of the American people were against the bill the leadership in both parties
[28:15.320 --> 28:20.520]  were for it bank heads then bragged to the press that they were hoarding the
[28:20.520 --> 28:24.360]  bailout money and using it to buy up smaller healthy banks and insurance
[28:24.360 --> 28:28.560]  companies their plan was working like a charm next the central bankers loaned the
[28:28.560 --> 28:35.600]  federal government back $787 billion of our own money at interest for president
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.000]  obama's so-called stimulus package as with the banker bailout congress was
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.080]  given less than an hour to read the 1070 plus page stimulus bill
[28:44.080 --> 28:47.880]  rock obama who had pledged on the campaign trail to wait five days before a
[28:47.880 --> 28:51.320]  bill could be voted on so the people could read it said that the stimulus was
[28:51.320 --> 28:55.440]  too important and it had to be passed before anybody could see it or a crisis
[28:55.440 --> 28:58.680]  would turn into a catastrophe and then we play clips of them saying everything
[28:58.680 --> 29:03.720]  we're claiming her after its Friday passage barack obama took a four-day
[29:03.720 --> 29:08.440]  vacation and said that there was no rush to sign it the spending bill further
[29:08.440 --> 29:12.840]  federalized the states and paid off rich donors that had donated to both parties
[29:12.840 --> 29:17.040]  as the world slid deeper into depression the bankers celebrated their
[29:17.040 --> 29:21.120]  fire sale that they had created with their access to unlimited fiat capital
[29:21.120 --> 29:25.000]  they could buy up sectors of the world economy not already controlled by them
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.720]  for over a century the Anglo-American establishment had worked to bring the
[29:29.720 --> 29:35.800]  world system to this point artificial artificially in artificially engineered
[29:35.800 --> 29:40.320]  global bankruptcy when we come back I will complete this little voice over

[33:01.080 --> 33:06.800]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[33:06.800 --> 33:14.400]  because there's a war on for your mind continuing as the world slid deeper into
[33:14.400 --> 33:19.560]  depression the bankers celebrated the fire sale that they had created now
[33:19.560 --> 33:23.360]  their global consolidation was accelerating with their access to
[33:23.360 --> 33:27.440]  unlimited fiat capital they could buy up sectors the world economy not already
[33:27.440 --> 33:31.800]  controlled by them they're over a century the Anglo-American establishment
[33:31.800 --> 33:36.840]  had worked to bring the world system to this point artificially engineered
[33:36.840 --> 33:41.720]  global bankruptcy in an address before the trilateral Commission in June of
[33:41.720 --> 33:48.040]  1991 David Rockefeller laid out the elites ultimate goal and I quote the
[33:48.040 --> 33:53.600]  super national sovereignty of an intellectual lead in world bankers is
[33:53.600 --> 33:58.800]  surely preferable to the national auto determination practice in the last
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.640]  centuries now that the bankers were holding the world hostage they issued
[34:03.640 --> 34:08.040]  their ultimatum the only solution to restart the global economy would be to
[34:08.040 --> 34:12.360]  set up a planetary government ruled by a new bank of the world that's a time
[34:12.360 --> 34:17.520]  magazine headline a bank of the world owned by them suddenly hundreds of
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.680]  prominent publications announced the solution the people's only salvation
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.320]  time magazine an article titled the new world order said that the new super bank
[34:26.320 --> 34:30.600]  would control the world's currencies and set interest rates and that the new
[34:30.600 --> 34:37.640]  bank would quote knock the heads of bad countries like the United States at a
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.040]  meeting of central bank heads and finance ministers dubbed Bretton Woods to the
[34:42.040 --> 34:45.880]  plan for world government was unveiled by the very bankers that had engineered
[34:45.880 --> 34:49.400]  the collapse formerly sovereign countries would now pay their taxes
[34:49.400 --> 34:53.400]  directly to the banking cartel hundreds of new carbon taxes controlling every
[34:53.400 --> 35:00.400]  facet of human activity would only be the beginning and that's the kind of
[35:00.400 --> 35:05.080]  voiceovers that are in the film it's a classic you know Alex Jones documentary
[35:05.080 --> 35:10.040]  a lot of voiceover I'd say about a 20% of its voiceover but you know we lay out
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.680]  the facts in every every line we claim we have the articles and documents and
[35:13.680 --> 35:19.560]  bills and video clips there to back that up for everybody and unlike the
[35:19.560 --> 35:23.080]  mainstream media we like to a neurotically document everything we
[35:23.080 --> 35:31.600]  cover now let's go ahead and go to your phone calls let's talk to a fella
[35:31.600 --> 35:39.480]  calling from Saudi Arabia first and that's a keel welcome or he's in Qatar
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.600]  near Saudi Arabia excuse me here on my list a keel you're on the air welcome
[35:44.600 --> 35:50.880]  hi Alex how are you good sir firstly elected thank you for everything you've
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.520]  done so far born and raised in Australia and just in Qatar at the moment doing
[35:56.520 --> 36:02.040]  some study and doing some work so far I've watched a lot of your documentaries
[36:02.040 --> 36:07.200]  and really I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart well I'd like to
[36:07.200 --> 36:14.240]  thank you we I think this this issue is that like you revealed in the dark
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.960]  secrets of the Bohemian growth this really is an issue of people the devil
[36:19.960 --> 36:25.720]  trying to take over the world and prepare it for him or whatever they
[36:25.720 --> 36:31.560]  would like to do and I've started giving out a lot of your documentaries to to
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.720]  my friends here from other different Muslim countries and they're taking a
[36:35.720 --> 36:39.160]  look and we've started a study group and they'll go back to their countries and
[36:39.160 --> 36:50.640]  well as well and start the same thing so I would like to perhaps wonder if I'm
[36:50.640 --> 36:56.720]  actually wondering whether you have any of them in Arabic any of the edit into
[36:56.720 --> 37:01.120]  Arabic at all you know we get a lot of calls about translating the films into
[37:01.120 --> 37:06.040]  Chinese and to German and the French into Arabic I barely have the funds to
[37:06.040 --> 37:11.840]  even get these films made it's very expensive for us with our budget to have
[37:11.840 --> 37:14.520]  these done in multiple languages but what's happening is because we give them
[37:14.520 --> 37:17.880]  out for free they're all over the file-sharing networks and YouTube and
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.640]  Google and LiveLeak and blip TV and you know hundreds of platforms and most of
[37:22.640 --> 37:29.320]  my major releases are in Chinese are in Russian are in Arabic are in Spanish and
[37:29.320 --> 37:34.440]  so you just Google say the name of one of my films like in-game blueprint for
[37:34.440 --> 37:39.120]  global enslavement in Espanol or in-game blueprint for global enslavement in
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.640]  Arabic and if the whole film hasn't been translated you'll get almost always
[37:43.640 --> 37:48.520]  find sections or key parts of the films that have been translated so really this
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.200]  is a group effort I challenge anybody out there who wants to take my films and
[37:53.200 --> 37:56.000]  translate them and put them on the web for free we only ask they're not they
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.800]  not be sold to do that I mean that's our whole goal here is to affect change and
[38:01.800 --> 38:05.560]  wake people up and unlock minds and try to back off this great Terry that's
[38:05.560 --> 38:08.920]  coming down on the planet so I would challenge folks who want the films
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.440]  translated into Arabic to not wait for orders from headquarters but go to the
[38:13.440 --> 38:19.720]  sound of the guns fantastic and I'd also like to I'm I like to really point out
[38:19.720 --> 38:24.160]  to the listeners but that I understand a lot of people say that Obama the Muslim
[38:24.160 --> 38:30.400]  and things like that and even if the ideas that he promotes everything that
[38:30.400 --> 38:36.480]  he stands for which you've been courageously exposing that is not
[38:36.480 --> 38:42.520]  Islamic and the Muslims include a long time for more than a thousand years in
[38:42.520 --> 38:47.600]  peace and it's these people who are the danger to people who believe in God so
[38:47.600 --> 38:50.400]  I'd like to thank you for that well thank you I agree with you let me just make
[38:50.400 --> 38:56.520]  this statement my film the Obama deception the Obama deception net does
[38:56.520 --> 39:02.880]  not attack Obama because his father was Kenyan it is not attack Obama because
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.400]  some could question whether he was really born in the United States it
[39:06.400 --> 39:11.040]  doesn't go after those red hearings and I'm not saying that people don't have a
[39:11.040 --> 39:14.880]  legitimate right to investigate that and that there wasn't some cover up going
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.920]  on there but I don't know what the truth is with that we don't go after Barack
[39:18.920 --> 39:24.600]  Obama for you know even the Communist background because that's a big
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.440]  foundation cover you know we hear oh he's a communist oh he's a terrorist oh
[39:29.440 --> 39:33.640]  you know he's a Muslim and you're right he's diametrically opposed to you know
[39:33.640 --> 39:37.920]  what you would see with the basic Muslim or even Christian religion we expose
[39:37.920 --> 39:41.240]  Obama because he's lied about everything he said he would do everything
[39:41.240 --> 39:45.800]  and he's done it very very sneakily and it's an incredible betrayal I mean I
[39:45.800 --> 39:51.720]  remember nine ten months before the election I was on air saying man if this
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.920]  Obama really does what he says he's gonna do I he's a great guy I mean he's
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.280]  gonna bring the troops home day one and then it was six months and then it was
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.480]  16 months and now it's 23 months and he's increasing troops in Afghanistan
[40:04.480 --> 40:09.320]  from 30,000 to 60,000 now they're talking about 90,000 and he's trying to spin
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.280]  it and say I never really said they were all coming home I said well some of them
[40:12.280 --> 40:16.600]  he said he was gonna get rid of Naftan Gatt that it was horrible and then they
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.160]  put out internal memos that have been confirmed and then he even gave an
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.600]  interview to the press and said yeah that was just campaign rhetoric saying
[40:23.600 --> 40:26.920]  oh we're not gonna get rid of Naftan Gatt that we're gonna expand the security
[40:26.920 --> 40:31.800]  and prosperity partnership for the North American Union so he lied about that he
[40:31.800 --> 40:36.080]  said that he was gonna have no lobbyist in his administration and folks he's
[40:36.080 --> 40:40.720]  worse than George Bush who we decried I mean the head Raytheon lobbyist number
[40:40.720 --> 40:46.600]  two at defense Leon Panetta huge Wall Street lobbyist director of CIA most of
[40:46.600 --> 40:49.880]  his nominees end up having to step down because they're such incredible lobbyist
[40:49.880 --> 40:55.000]  that took even questionable money I mean the list goes on and on and and with
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.120]  Bush normally you know there'd be two or three deep of lobbyists with Obama it
[40:59.120 --> 41:04.560]  will be 10 20 30 40 from the top guy down to you know 30 deep in the power
[41:04.560 --> 41:08.920]  structure of these federal bureaucracies there I mean this is the lobbyist
[41:08.920 --> 41:12.920]  administration even counterpunched it's very progressive and a legitimate
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.480]  liberal news source you know when these phony establishment ones is saying they
[41:17.480 --> 41:23.080]  have a headline today that Obama the the the president for special interest I
[41:23.080 --> 41:27.760]  mean I mean he's worse than Bush he didn't just lie and then appoint some
[41:27.760 --> 41:34.560]  lobbyist that's basically all he's doing it just makes my head spin I mean the
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.680]  new guy's gonna have over health and human services you know the I mean massive
[41:39.680 --> 41:44.080]  lobbyist it just goes on and on for health care in fact they're not just
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.840]  lobbyists they're always lobbyists from the industry that they're now over in
[41:47.840 --> 41:53.000]  government then he said I'm gonna shut down Guantanamo Bay but if you read the
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.360]  executive order it said we're gonna look at shutting it in one year but we're
[41:56.360 --> 41:59.680]  gonna have other camps around the US in the world we're gonna continue rendition
[41:59.680 --> 42:05.040]  what the LA Times called the practice of abducting people and we're gonna
[42:05.040 --> 42:11.080]  continue the harsh interrogation he said that they would again read bills give
[42:11.080 --> 42:14.840]  people five days read bills then he rushes through on the bailout when he
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.280]  was on showing that in the Senate and now the stimulus no one's allowed to
[42:19.280 --> 42:28.760]  read it he said that I mean just so many things that he's gone back on over and
[42:28.760 --> 42:36.160]  over and over and over again so many lies that you can't find anywhere where
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.440]  Obama has told the truth about what he was going to do other than global
[42:40.440 --> 42:47.480]  warming now folks this is a global tax not my opinion the club of Rome the
[42:47.480 --> 42:51.320]  Council on Foreign Relations the government bureaucracies testimony in
[42:51.320 --> 42:55.160]  Congress years ago I mean I have the testimony in my film in-game where
[42:55.160 --> 42:58.160]  they're saying yes it's gonna be a tax on all human activity a tax on
[42:58.160 --> 43:05.480]  everything you do on carbon dioxide to control this is neo feudalism meanwhile
[43:05.480 --> 43:10.400]  it is a cover for the real environmental crises we have instead of
[43:10.400 --> 43:15.360]  school children learning how bad cross species genetic hybrids part spider part
[43:15.360 --> 43:21.080]  goat pig part human to harvest organs that gives rise to super viruses and all
[43:21.080 --> 43:25.360]  sorts of mutations there are tens of thousands now tens of thousands of
[43:25.360 --> 43:31.600]  cross species creations plants with cockroach genes and salmon genes salmon
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.480]  with corn genes there are some cross species creations that have more than a
[43:36.480 --> 43:42.120]  hundred different organisms genetics directly put in and it's already
[43:42.120 --> 43:45.960]  spreading into the environment causing all these problems in the biosphere
[43:45.960 --> 43:49.640]  you've got plants being grown open air that have been genetically altered with
[43:49.640 --> 43:54.240]  other species DNA jumping into other plants directly connected in major
[43:54.240 --> 43:59.160]  German Dutch and Japanese studies of the bee die off their genetically
[43:59.160 --> 44:04.880]  engineering pesticide into scores of crops where the bugs can't eat it or
[44:04.880 --> 44:09.680]  they'll die but then humans eat it and they go find the dead honey bees with a
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.800]  whole colony dies and they cut them open and go into them and they have the
[44:14.800 --> 44:19.520]  pesticide in them that is grown in the pharmacological corn and the other
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.120]  crops the little bees go and eat the pollen and they die because most insects
[44:24.120 --> 44:28.320]  smell it with their olfactory centers and fly off and don't eat it did you know
[44:28.320 --> 44:33.760]  pigs won't eat most these GMO crops that's the real crisis depleted uranium
[44:33.760 --> 44:38.120]  being used at proving grounds all over the United States Canada and Europe as
[44:38.120 --> 44:42.280]  billions and billions a year half-life in all the government studies
[44:42.280 --> 44:47.240]  admittedly causes massive cancer Israel just used it in Gaza totally insane
[44:47.240 --> 44:54.200]  blew across Israel that's how the winds blow from west to east in the jet
[44:54.200 --> 44:58.720]  stream every time it's used radiation detectors in England and all of the
[44:58.720 --> 45:02.400]  world pick it up thousands of miles away because it's particularized and it
[45:02.400 --> 45:08.560]  goes around the planet over and over again depleted uranium you know cutting
[45:08.560 --> 45:13.960]  down the rainforest overfishing the seas there are real things happening that
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.040]  are serious and instead oh we're gonna tax everything you do with carbon
[45:18.040 --> 45:25.560]  dioxide as a toxic waste listing it as a dangerous pollutant that's gonna kill
[45:25.560 --> 45:31.640]  the polar bears the last study they did before the newest a decade ago showed
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.440]  around 35,000 polar bears in the world guess how many polar bears there are
[45:36.440 --> 45:43.600]  now 40 plus thousand 45,000 over 10,000 more polar bears you can pull up the
[45:43.600 --> 45:48.080]  numbers but the news knows the public is ignorant about what's happening with
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.040]  wildlife and they show polar bears on ice flows and they go oh look at the
[45:52.040 --> 45:56.160]  mommy with a baby they can't swim global warming made the glacier melt look
[45:56.160 --> 45:59.880]  glaciers are collapsing glaciers always it rains the glacier pushes out to the
[45:59.880 --> 46:05.000]  ocean it they're always expanding and then contracting they're always have
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.920]  ice flows it is the strongest swimmer of any land animal they have been
[46:09.920 --> 46:15.960]  recorded swimming up to 300 miles they routinely take 150 mile swims they go
[46:15.960 --> 46:23.000]  out to the ice flows and hunt seal and beluga they are so strong one polar bear
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.520]  can reach in and grab a multi-thousand pound beluga whale and drag it up on the
[46:27.520 --> 46:35.520]  ice and eat it with one arm with one arm and the news says and teaches children
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.520]  the polar bears are drowning because the ice caps are melting folks the sun was
[46:40.520 --> 46:44.240]  in its brightest cycle ever recorded in several hundred years of it being
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.800]  documented one of the most intensely studied phenomenon continually as the
[46:49.800 --> 47:00.480]  sun moons of Jupiter and of Saturn that had ice shelves that had that were
[47:00.480 --> 47:05.760]  frozen had now melted because the Sun was so bright and putting off so much
[47:05.760 --> 47:11.480]  heat the ice caps of Mars were receding by several miles a year until two years
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.280]  ago it's the Sun not carbon dioxide suddenly the moons froze again
[47:17.280 --> 47:23.760]  orbiting Saturn and Jupiter and the ice caps began exploding in size the tiny
[47:23.760 --> 47:28.720]  cap on the south the larger cap on the north of Mars this is a in
[47:28.720 --> 47:37.560]  a controversial fact your SUV is not making moons melt their oceans of
[47:37.560 --> 47:45.240]  methane they are not making the water ice caps of Mars melt the Sun is doing it
[47:45.240 --> 47:54.720]  the Sun is causing it not carbon dioxide on the earth the UN's own study
[47:54.720 --> 47:58.400]  admits that about 1% of the carbon dioxide on the earth is being put out by
[47:58.400 --> 48:02.880]  humans the ocean though is made up of carbon dioxide volcanoes put out more
[48:02.880 --> 48:06.960]  carbon dioxide a large gaseous explosion like Mount St. Helens than all human
[48:06.960 --> 48:12.920]  activity in all of recorded history this is on record these greenhouse gases are
[48:12.920 --> 48:20.480]  part of our shield from the radiation the Sun that's why it's so dangerous for
[48:20.480 --> 48:25.520]  airline pilots who fly for decades above 30,000 feet because in that 30,000 feet
[48:25.520 --> 48:30.360]  there's upwards of 10 feet of water if you condense it down in the atmosphere
[48:30.360 --> 48:34.280]  that is a shield and so that's why it's the equivalent of getting multiple
[48:34.280 --> 48:39.680]  chest x-rays every time you fly during the daylight hours in an aircraft above
[48:39.680 --> 48:49.400]  30,000 feet it's the Sun it's powerful it's massive it is radiating and it's so
[48:49.400 --> 48:55.880]  important that we explain that to people they tell you that they have to tax and
[48:55.880 --> 49:01.360]  limit CO2 in the United States because the polar bears are dying and drowning
[49:01.360 --> 49:05.800]  and because they're threatened that is a fraud there are 10,000 more polar bears
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.280]  than there were a decade ago record numbers their populations are exploding
[49:11.280 --> 49:16.240]  and archaeologists have done studies and have dug in the fossil record and it
[49:16.240 --> 49:21.480]  shows that during the hiberium maxim and other heating periods going back 10,000
[49:21.480 --> 49:27.480]  years ago that polar bear populations explode when it's warm polar bears lose
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.760]  upwards of 30% of their weight during the winter they almost starved to death
[49:31.760 --> 49:40.640]  they wait for the summer they need the heat it is a lie but I told you Mars
[49:40.640 --> 49:46.160]  ice caps are getting bigger now after shrinking they predicted in 2008 Al Gore
[49:46.160 --> 49:48.880]  and others who bought who owns by the way the carbon company you'll buy your

[54:27.280 --> 54:29.400]  air
[54:29.840 --> 54:37.320]  hello yes sir I hear a lot of music okay I'd like to say about that cartoon that
[54:37.320 --> 54:43.000]  that's it's just Lenten cartoon satire about the chimpanzee but what I'm
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.040]  calling about is that there's an article in the Washington Times here it's
[54:47.040 --> 54:53.320]  talking about the holder says us cowardly on race back about six months ago or
[54:53.320 --> 54:57.240]  what whenever it was you know I kind of figured that this was going to be a
[54:57.240 --> 55:02.360]  black power grab and I said it was I could excerpt some of the comments here
[55:02.360 --> 55:08.640]  criticism from conservatives Tom Fenton conservative judicial watch he says a
[55:08.640 --> 55:12.680]  quoting I think we're going back going to revert back to the old days of the
[55:12.680 --> 55:18.160]  federal government pushing quotas and race conscious of policy public policy
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.960]  Steve I hear you and I appreciate your call I'm going to say this about it you
[55:23.960 --> 55:28.560]  know we don't let the news government we talk about here you know whatever the
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.200]  newest big hype story is some cartoon in the New York Post it's got Al Sharpton
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.320]  running around or what Attorney General Eric Holder has to say I mean for heaven
[55:39.320 --> 55:44.080]  sakes a giant satellite blew up over Austin with a huge fireball in the
[55:44.080 --> 55:48.240]  sky Sunday and I haven't talked about that because it doesn't matter compared
[55:48.240 --> 55:52.640]  to global carbon taxes world government being set up I haven't talked about the
[55:52.640 --> 55:56.080]  chimpanzee ripping the ladies face off and attacking the police though it's
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.920]  very interesting hmm I will say this though it's so interesting I'm gonna
[56:00.920 --> 56:04.040]  have to talk about both those issues today and you're right the Eric Holder
[56:04.040 --> 56:08.720]  thing is a big news issue and I haven't discussed it yet where he said that
[56:08.720 --> 56:14.520]  America is a nation of cowards that won't discuss race and this is
[56:14.520 --> 56:20.840]  disgusting you see what the poverty pimps do most of Obama people from
[56:20.840 --> 56:24.680]  Chicago are limousine liberals and then their slumlords a lot of his
[56:24.680 --> 56:29.520]  confidants are and they feed and live off of playing everybody off against
[56:29.520 --> 56:34.640]  each other modern multiculturalism constantly points out our so-called
[56:34.640 --> 56:42.080]  differences over pigment in our skin in the name of fighting discrimination
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.360]  and things when I live in the United States I'm young I'm only 35 I grew up
[56:46.360 --> 56:50.640]  I didn't see a lot of racial strife I didn't hear a lot of racial strife it's
[56:50.640 --> 56:54.200]  the media that hives sit and then makes people look at each other different and
[56:54.200 --> 56:58.320]  makes people think about it and we have a lot of problems in this country and we
[56:58.320 --> 57:03.600]  certainly don't need Eric Holder calling Americans all cowards on race and and
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.640]  people saying there's been no real changes you know in 50 years and that
[57:07.640 --> 57:12.000]  and that everybody's still separate from each other well that is somewhat normal
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.680]  you know there's barrios right here in Austin Texas with the Latino folks and
[57:16.680 --> 57:21.760]  they will tell you that that that they enjoy they want to move to that area
[57:21.760 --> 57:27.960]  not all you know people want to be around folks that are like themselves take
[57:27.960 --> 57:33.240]  take Canada on the bordering areas where it's French and English you will go
[57:33.240 --> 57:37.440]  there and you will see it's all you know it's white people who are French and
[57:37.440 --> 57:41.480]  English predominantly but the neighborhoods are along in many cases
[57:41.480 --> 57:46.440]  lines of French versus English speakers and it's not because they hate each
[57:46.440 --> 57:50.280]  other it's their culture their mama and their daddy was French their grandma
[57:50.280 --> 57:55.080]  was French their French their their grandma and grandpa was English and so
[57:55.080 --> 58:00.800]  that's their culture that's who they tend to work with and be around and we do
[58:00.800 --> 58:04.440]  see people working together and living together and getting along and you know
[58:04.440 --> 58:09.200]  going out to restaurants together but we don't you know it says we need to talk
[58:09.200 --> 58:14.080]  about race at work we need to you know I find that that actually causes problems
[58:14.080 --> 58:18.280]  how about we all just be friends how about we not talk about what color
[58:18.280 --> 58:22.760]  people are all day but see the establishment wants to inject that into
[58:22.760 --> 58:26.440]  the debate inject that into the debate inject it into the debate so they can
[58:26.440 --> 58:30.040]  then get all this white guilt going and then attach different government
[58:30.040 --> 58:34.080]  policies and programs on to that so we can all be sharecroppers on the
[58:34.080 --> 58:41.320]  plantation okay so just a huge distraction and diversion

[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.920]  I want to get into the current operations of the globalist or social
[1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:29.840]  engineering they are now in hundreds and hundreds of publications announcing
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:33.120]  that world government's real they kept its secret for own good like the
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:37.040]  Financial Times of London headline and now for world government time magazine
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:40.280]  with the headline the New World Order saying that the US will be ruled by a
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:44.600]  new bank of the world and that they will quote knock nations heads including the
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:47.600]  United States they say the US is bad and caused everything when we've just been
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:52.840]  used to back it up and that to this new bank we will pay carbon taxes and they're
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:57.600]  now announcing carbon taxes over every facet so a they're expanding their
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:01.640]  announcements of this while simultaneously the FBI files say you're an
[1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:04.480]  extremist if you talk about a new world order so how does that double think work
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:09.000]  why are they announcing all of this and what will life be like under carbon
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:14.080]  taxes over what you eat what you do your home bureaucrats they're now announcing
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:17.640]  that they will have a million man domestic army the Pentagon has signed
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:21.720]  the order outside Congress and is setting that up let's go over that first
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:27.400]  with you today well there's no doubt about it this is planned a long time ago
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:33.200]  we're going through different stages towards this big agenda and especially
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:37.640]  after World War two and during World War two many politicians in the US and
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:42.480]  Britain published lots of books talking about this brave new world scenario
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:45.440]  they were bringing in and they were going to bring it in there was no doubt
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:51.400]  about it it was a matter of fooling the public basically and not steering them
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:55.920]  too much and implementing it gradually they'd already done their studies and
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:59.720]  realized the public would not suddenly go into a new world order in a global
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:05.040]  society with loss of sovereignty unless they did it incrementally and we find
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:10.680]  that meaner Keens and others who helped set up the financial system said this
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:15.240]  was part one of a system the part two would come in with a global society a
[1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:21.240]  world government and universal taxes towards this government so part two is
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:27.800]  happening right now on schedule in fact Keens wrote about this part two he said
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:32.360]  I won't see it in my lifetime he said but but towards the millennium and the
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:35.720]  beginning of the next millennium it says it will be implemented then that's
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:40.240]  what's happening right now and we're simply living through a script now the
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:45.040]  carbon taxes were talked about years ago it didn't call it carbon taxes if
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:48.240]  they were trying to get a global tax for the United Nations to bring it up to
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:52.600]  strength and they toss different ideas around and they make the grabbed on the
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:57.480]  Club of Rome's idea of global warming is an enemy and said they could use carbon
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:03.120]  taxes so that we literally literally are going through a script that was made
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:08.960]  before we were even born but this is the this is the emerging of the new world
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.720]  order which lets us know we're going into the final total takeover phase
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:15.440]  because at the end they always said that they would have to finally admit it all
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:19.080]  and unveil it and this is a great danger point for the globalist because
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:22.560]  they've denied it for decades now they've had to unveil it like a new ship
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:26.760]  they built behind curtains they're now launching it into the sea and we need to
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:30.280]  reach out to the public and explain to them this is a tyrannical world
[1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:34.400]  government not you know the loving little Star Trek global government that
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:40.240]  people advertise so let's come back and go over that Club of Rome CFR and others
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:47.160]  said it needs to be an outside crisis to unify man around global taxes and that
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:52.520]  man will really be the enemy so the state can wage war against mankind to
[1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:57.800]  carry out their eugenics program of forced inoculation and extermination
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:03.400]  Alan Watts stay with us everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:06.880]  part of our daily diet with so many different methods of consumption how
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:11.120]  do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake the friendly
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:15.760]  knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the answer nature's gem
[1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:20.800]  premium omega-3 unlike other flax seed our golden flax is grown on our farm in
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:24.640]  northern Minnesota providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:29.520]  producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around in addition we

[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:17.240]  we normally go live at prison planet dot TV during the third and fourth hour but
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:21.080]  some days we the whole show Shyamal casting not just on radio but on the
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:25.880]  internet streams at prison planet dot TV and I decided why not go live with Alan
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:31.080]  what at prison planet dot TV as well so we just now went live Alan covering the
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:36.160]  globalist master plan to use carbon taxes to control and micromanage and
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:41.280]  tax every facet of life our diets what we do inspectors in our homes taxing
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:46.480]  beef chicken when it's grown when it's raised and then on your table that's
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:50.040]  all being announced they would deny this you know now they're announcing their
[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:54.120]  world government break down what you were covering earlier in the last
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:58.200]  segment in more detail and then let's get into with your deep research of the
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:01.640]  globalist own research and documents which I can vouch for I've researched it
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:04.920]  all as well but you've you've intently researched it with your perspective
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:08.440]  where this is going and what we're going to see in the next few years the
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:12.600]  timeframe of the rollout but recap in more detail what you were just covering
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:16.720]  the last segment yes this is a script we're going through a script that was
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.920]  written a long time ago and basically drawn up by the big foundations that by
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:27.680]  past democracy or any idea of democracy and the ones who funded the NGOs and
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:32.160]  all the think tanks that they own and run these think tanks are the ones that
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:38.160]  advise all governments on policy and so when you look at them all it's one it's
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:42.080]  the same policy it's one policy out of a whole bunch of think tanks they're all
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:47.280]  interconnected with the one globalist agenda and all of these foundations and
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:51.280]  the Rockefellers and etc they're all to do with eugenics that they were always
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:57.080]  set up to do with eugenics creating a new type of society a reduced society
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:01.240]  and and actually going into the womb I read something the other night from
[1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:05.600]  Tony Blair's an interview that he gave to a newspaper on the fact that they
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:10.080]  wouldn't go into the womb and remove those genes basically that would cause
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.680]  someone to be violent or an extremist when they grew up and for those that
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:18.080]  don't know in my film in my film in game we have the mainstream news articles
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:22.960]  out of England where two-year-olds are put on probation with the police because
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:27.360]  of the quote genes of their parents if their parents or grandparents ever
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:32.800]  committed a crime they are now criminals at age two and they've talked about in
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:38.800]  Oregon years ago drugging babies in the womb if their parents are poor and show
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:43.640]  that they could be mentally ill I'm not kidding Prozac in the womb please
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:48.040]  continue yes and it's more than just that it's also something that was
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:52.920]  discussed over a hundred years ago at world meetings and and that was the
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:57.560]  necessity to identify those who could have leadership qualities down the road
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:02.960]  and go against their agenda and and get the public to follow them that's also
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:06.480]  part of this big screening process they've done the same thing with the
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:10.360]  drugging of children mainly young males in school with pro with the different
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:15.920]  drugs to give them riddling etc this is to these guys are generally very
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:20.480]  inquisitive they ask lots of questions their diagnosis being hyper because they
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:24.240]  ask questions or they're not happy with the answers they get and the general
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:29.680]  health leadership of the ability so the agenda has never ever faltered from how
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:33.280]  it was set down a hundred years ago they're right on track with this and
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:37.840]  they're doing it they're implementing it and they hope to bring in a society
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:41.840]  that which I think is here now to be honest with you which will accept the
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:47.440]  changes over the next up to the year 2050 that's their big target date for
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:52.360]  drastic population reduction it's in all the big think tanks papers it's in the
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:56.560]  military think tanks papers as well for Britain and the US and they say the
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:01.440]  drastic reduction at the year 2050 the world to bring in two will also be a
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:06.280]  vegetarian world that's on the cards they say that the raising of livestock is
[1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:12.040]  too labor-intensive and cost-intensive for carbon etc so they eliminate meat
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:17.400]  for the masses and the left with the GMO foods but population reduction is a
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:21.720]  big big part of this and eventually they hope to bring themselves through the
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:27.120]  top these wise ones ones that think that they're superior and believe it so with
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:33.080]  a technocratic and scientific elite coming through with them and just a few
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:37.800]  servants to basically supply their needs at the bottom so this is the whole this
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:42.960]  is their big agenda for their brave new world and unfortunately the well on their
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:46.000]  way today that they're well on their way just there's very little public
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:51.320]  opposition when you take the vast amounts of people in the world today
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:56.080]  there's very few people who really care they have had work done on their minds
[1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:00.800]  since birth they've had total indoctrination through the international
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:05.600]  educational system along the same path of sit back enjoy yourself and don't
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:10.680]  complain about anything we're talking about neo feudalism in the globalist
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:14.760]  own words speak about the final revolution the scientific elite
[1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:18.920]  integrated with the central banks as David Rockefeller said in the quote I
[1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:23.480]  read earlier ruling over humanity dumbing us down domesticating us
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:28.520]  fattening us up so we'd be weak so that they could then get rid of our instinct
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:33.880]  for survival to then have an organized soft kill operation so let's get into
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:38.200]  the new man and getting rid of the old man how from their own documents they
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:41.960]  plan to incrementally through one-child policies GMO foods force
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:47.760]  inoculations reduce the world population by 80 to 90% yes it's even more
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:52.600]  insidious they they have done experiments after kussler who worked for
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:59.440]  mi-5 and mi-6 during the war was also attached to think tanks in New York and
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:04.640]  an experimental scientific laboratories for the United Nations and he said that
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:09.040]  they'd already done experiments on lobotomizing that part of your brain
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:15.960]  which makes you you uniquely you he called it the ghost in the machine and he
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:19.680]  said there's different techniques one of them was was a delivery of chemicals to
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:25.080]  the brain via an oculation was very successful and he also said to you
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:29.040]  won't need your survival capabilities because again the state will be making
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:32.800]  all your decisions for you and Bertrand Russell said the same thing he said
[1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:40.240]  through diet education and other forms of brainwashing that and through
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.280]  injecting people that humanity being able to rebel against their
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:49.640]  extermination would be as futile as sheep forming a rebellion against the
[1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:55.480]  practice of eating mutton that's right so it's a Russell and a Kessler all of
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:59.800]  these guys and Russell Kessler by the way both work for a mi-5 that's a that's
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:04.880]  in the open now now declassified is declassified so and again you have the
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:10.040]  Huxleys as well who wrote about this and in the 30s and Julian Huxley ended up
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:14.680]  running UNESCO and he was quite open about the agenda of international
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:19.360]  education which would in reality be an incredible scientific indoctrination
[1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:24.080]  which would dumb the people down to the limit except anything and they all were
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:29.120]  on track with the vast reduction of the population and again this brave new
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:33.320]  world where only the fittest would come through they're all Darwinists
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:36.960]  basically and they do believe they're more evolved than the rest of the general
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:42.800]  public absolutely you know and I've talked to globalist and you know people
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:46.720]  in the elite and their fellow travelers they say Alex you're aware of all this
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:50.760]  that means you should be one of us look the slaves don't care notice how you
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:53.400]  tell them and they you know they don't care if we're putting fluoride in the
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:56.800]  water they don't care if we're injecting them with mercury they don't deserve to
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:00.560]  go into the future and it's a very sick mindset because they take the general
[1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:05.280]  public and dumb it down even further you know they advertise eugenics as
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:10.360]  positive eugenics advancing the elite and negative eugenics you know culling
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:15.280]  out the the the inferiors but in reality when you read deeper into eugenics
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:21.200]  it's really about as you said suppressing the best in humanity that
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:25.560]  isn't evil you know they want the best of humanity that is evil you know that
[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:29.480]  has their cold-blooded worldview they're threatened by those on the light side
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:33.600]  who are intelligent and can go through and defeat all this propaganda mentally
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.760]  and make it through they want to neutralize and actually dumb down the
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:42.800]  mass it is the ultimate crime it's a crime but the city also run on these
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:46.920]  odd theories that they become their realities the force these realities
[1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:52.240]  upon the public and we find out that the in the u.s. and in the britain for
[1:16:52.240 --> 1:16:57.240]  instance and most countries in the west the implement a policy from a
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:02.240]  philosopher israel berlin and oxford university who talked about negative
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:06.280]  freedom and positive freedom and he said we're running the world right now on
[1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:11.000]  negative freedom where the people are basically kept dumb stupid and happy but
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:15.360]  look there's very little interference from the state and when tony blair was
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:21.680]  in he wrote to this this mentor and he asked is it possible to combine that
[1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:26.120]  type of freedom with positive freedom positive freedom is where you get the
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:30.520]  whole world or all of society working like the soviets towards some great new
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:36.200]  dawn working together and he wants to combine the two of them and he asked
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:42.520]  this mentor if it was possible to do so so it's astonishing to realize the the
[1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:46.240]  dumbers all down they keep us dumb and stupid stupid they give us the worst
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:52.040]  education in a long long time and until we do have no reasoning abilities for
[1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:55.640]  ourselves they give us all the inoculations which do affect the
[1:17:55.640 --> 1:18:00.240]  brain I've no doubt about that whatsoever they target the brain and and then
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:05.280]  they blame us for being dumb and stupid this is a this is again a psychopathic
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:10.160]  outlook on on the world that's how a psychopathic would see it he blames his
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:16.680]  victim for the state they're in absolutely so you have this tiny maybe
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:19.960]  one out of five hundred people that's an actual psychopath about one out of a
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:24.000]  hundred that's a sociopath of the studies and they create these guilds and
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:29.360]  then have their own pseudo humanist religion that rationalizes the horrible
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:32.080]  things they do with them for the general public they tell them they're doing
[1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:36.340]  this for their own good but in private and in their own white papers they
[1:18:36.340 --> 1:18:42.240]  chortle with glee it's the ultimate control freaks power trip it is as I
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:48.760]  always liken it to a farmer breaking the legs on on his cow and then kicking
[1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:52.600]  the cow because it can't get up because that's what they've done to society
[1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:56.560]  they've crippled the reasoning abilities of the general public and they
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:19:02.120]  blame society for happening very very sick people but that's a replay of
[1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:07.000]  feudalism I've read five hundred six hundred year old you know communicates
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:10.720]  between French and British royalty who were cousins and we've got to have a new
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:14.720]  war you know our people are getting uppity oh we need to keep them down
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:19.160]  this way you need to rape their women so they don't have any family lines because
[1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:22.560]  that psychologically breaks them you need to keep them at starvation level to
[1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:26.520]  control them and that's what feudalism was not allowing to hunt not allowing to
[1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:29.640]  have firewood having to give most of what they produced to the elites the
[1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:33.880]  police the the elites would be a foot and a half taller they call the slaves the
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:38.160]  little people and they enjoyed the fact that they were starving and had snot
[1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:42.640]  running down their faces as they rode by in their finery and then in Japan they
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:48.120]  have the same system this is what slave masters do they hate us doing well they
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:52.200]  hate us being beautiful they hate our ideas they hate the fact that it's the
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:57.400]  hybrid individual system that is actually more dynamic than them and that
[1:19:57.400 --> 1:20:03.400]  rises from the general mass this year many of us will have to make the tough
[1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:07.920]  decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an

[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:12.560]  Jones on the GCN radio network Alan I'd like you to specifically get into who
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:16.880]  Barack Obama is the betrayals we've already witnessed and how he was
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:20.880]  perfectly packaged you know from your own perspective because you know they've
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:23.280]  built up all this hatred of Bush who certainly deserved it but he's still
[1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:26.440]  just a front for the globalist all of our energies are put into you know him
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:30.280]  instead of what the elites are actually doing behind the scenes so they use him
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:35.840]  as a shield then all that hatred of Bush is transferred into love of Obama as
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:39.600]  they advertise him as president of the world I mean and then out of the gates
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:43.800]  he's betraying everything he said he'd do but his zombie-like followers who
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:49.200]  aren't even bad people they're just you know so committed and signed on to him
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:53.040]  that they're now making excuses for all of the betrayals can you speak to
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:58.440]  Barack Obama yeah it's just the old puppets there's a new puppet and a new
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:03.640]  puppet show for the public because the last puppet show was becoming
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.320]  disgusting always get disgusted with politicians that's what they say but
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:11.920]  democracy you don't vote new people in you vote the last bunch out it's so
[1:25:11.920 --> 1:25:16.680]  sick of them and that they're putting in this this man because we've seen so much
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:21.040]  corruption over the years the politics and politicians were losing their
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:24.920]  their favor and eyes of the public were losing all respect for them in fact
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:28.200]  that's why they came in with the idea of terrorism it gave government a new
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:33.520]  command over the public that was the main idea behind it a new myth for the age
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:38.840]  of terrorism but Barack Obama is just another one of their boys you can see
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:42.840]  all of his connections the CFR and so on he's committed to their agenda he's
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:47.760]  given many speeches at the CFR you can actually find them on the web and he's
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:51.960]  all gung-ho for this whole new world order idea now he's just sent off another
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:56.480]  he's going to set up another 75,000 troops to to Afghanistan or something
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:00.640]  I mean he's going right along with it and he's got Brzezinski backing him up as
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:06.280]  well with his policies the very man who helped start off the war between
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:11.240]  Afghanis and Russia is now keeping it going and that's what's so arrogant
[1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:15.360]  about it is that Obama even more than Bush will go on Stefan Havelis' show
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:20.560]  other shows on every issue on NAFTA on GATT on torture on secret arrest on
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:24.080]  expanding the war and he'll just say oh that was just campaign rhetoric and they
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:28.200]  go oh yeah you know it's just I lied to you you know it's no big deal
[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:32.440]  that's that's right it's the same old stuff and I think those of us who get a
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:35.560]  bit older have seen so much of this their whole life's long we take no
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:38.560]  interest in them are tall they're born liars that's why they're picked there
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:42.880]  and put there I don't think you find ordinary people trying to get into
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:47.560]  politics you certainly won't find them getting up there in politics because the
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.800]  psychopathic types gravitate towards politics they like the power they're
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:56.520]  natural liars they're at home amongst other psychopaths and so that's the only
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:00.080]  type unfortunately that seems to get in there but they're not the bosses as we
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:04.760]  know we know that it's the big foundations with their advising think
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.160]  tanks that are the policy makers the politicians really are just are nothing
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:16.120]  more than frontman absolutely let's get into the next 10 years is the program
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:19.800]  behind is it on schedule what will we see unfold in the next year the next two
[1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:23.920]  years the next five the next seven they you know on in the 10 if they're
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:28.360]  continuing with their program successfully well I know that brzezinski
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:31.840]  and Kissinger both said the same things that the United States now must take the
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:36.600]  backseat as a policeman of the world will gradually submerge into this new
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:40.760]  world order they will lose of all their favorite status meaning their power and
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:46.320]  sovereignty as they submerge themselves into the system we also know too that the
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:50.440]  second part of the Bretton Woods agreement is coming into force the very
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:54.120]  part that to mean our kings talked about where they're bringing in a world of
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:28:00.360]  service now government is in bed really with the bankers government now has a
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:06.000]  same in your personal bank account they'll use money and your bank account as
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:10.200]  a weapon against you to make you go along with it with all the new protocols
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:15.400]  and dictates as to what you'll eat what you'll buy maybe you're buying too much
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:20.760]  your carbons emitting stuff etc so money is to be used as a weapon against
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:25.560]  every single person on the world will take Finland will take Finland I mean
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:29.320]  as you know over a decade ago all your bank accounts are controlled by the
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:32.520]  government when you get a ticket or a fine they just take it out of your account
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:36.200]  it's taken out of your account according to how much money you have so it's class
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:40.360]  warfare society the government admits they listen to all cell phone calls the
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:43.680]  fins have been conditioned to accept that everything's tracked everything's
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:50.400]  controlled they euthanized the old they you know abortion on demand one child
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:53.720]  policy basically being brought in and now we're hearing them hype that here as
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:58.160]  well so this is a hellish society of micro management yes and it is global
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:03.480]  again the UN was set up as the front for this organization once again the same
[1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:07.560]  foundations and Rockefellas and so on Ford Carnegie for the ones who who
[1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:12.440]  started set up the United Nations and funded it into existence they're the
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:18.000]  real bosses here and what's astonishing is to find old Rockefeller in 94 still
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:23.040]  going around the world giving talks to to globalist societies and meetings
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:28.320]  about the depopulation of the planet being of utmost urgency he's never
[1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:32.400]  changed his tune his whole life is his adamant now as he was when he was 18
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:35.680]  and that's official State Department policy under State Department
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:40.280]  memorandum 200 by Henry Kissinger and the classified CIA virgin of that the
[1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:44.600]  extermination of the world population is the goal world government is only the
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:53.680]  means for the end will be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the

[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.840]  to keep a secret from the public it's a new world order we're gonna take their
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:41.240]  liberties through phony environmentalism and the threat of phony
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:45.280]  terrorism it's declassified the US the British and others have staged hundreds
[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:52.040]  of terror attacks on record so of course we look at 9-11 and then go to the
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:56.200]  evidence that it was an inside job it's time to stop being childlike and I know
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:59.880]  this stuff so scary that a lot of people want to rationalize or make excuses to
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:06.040]  say it isn't real because it's just too painful for them to imagine but when the
[1:35:06.040 --> 1:35:10.680]  official army training manual for all army captains in special operations
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:15.120]  teaches them how to stage terror attacks and false flags I mean we have to live
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:22.520]  in the real world here we have to face the evidence and they are engaging in
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:25.520]  eugenics they are pushing one-child policies now in the West saying that
[1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:30.000]  they're gonna tax your carbon footprint having more than one child this is
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.800]  unfolding Alan there is a mass awakening happening so I see a lot of
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:39.080]  positive things happening and I know the globalist aren't invincible no matter
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:43.920]  how sophisticated their propaganda is being aware of it is the battle 40 plus
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:47.800]  billion dollars the Pentagon is going to use in the US and worldwide to fix their
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:53.640]  image and then you watch HBO and its PR pieces for the military you there's
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:58.960]  military pamphlets everywhere it's all over the news isn't that a sign of being
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:03.320]  in a police state I mean we are so propagandize with the fake news and the
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:08.880]  fake reporters and all of the news packaging that Congress admits is going
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:13.680]  on and it's only intensifying can't that propaganda backfire on the
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.160]  establishment or because they're just immersing the population from every
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:24.840]  angle with it will it be effective it's been effective so far as I say when you
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:30.600]  go into there's a good video up there by a guy who does a lot of work the BBC
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:36.840]  Adam Curtis is called the power of nightmares and he goes in to the
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:41.640]  psychology behind setting up a world of terrorism and how politicians needed this
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:45.560]  because they were losing all respect from the general public they were so
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:49.720]  corrupt that they needed this new authority and authorities we're here
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.560]  to protect you and they created a myth of terrorism worldwide of course this
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:58.720]  myth was to be expanded to include anyone who was politically incorrect on
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:04.320]  many topics various topics that's what's happening today it's a tool it's a tool
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:09.200]  and terror is being used on the general public by the politicians and the
[1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:13.800]  governments that they're chasing shadows looking for terrorism everywhere and
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:18.640]  Adam Curtis did an excellent job of exposing this using documents that
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:22.880]  they had stored in the BBC archives to show you the whole thing was a farce
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:27.200]  from the beginning to end but it's unnecessary this comes back down to the
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:31.920]  neo-conservatives who dreamed up the policy taken from Leo Strauss who taught
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:37.160]  both of its and others the fact that they need they need a myth for every age
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:42.280]  to get their agenda through and they created the myth of terrorism everywhere
[1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:46.960]  it's an exaggeration of the old regs under the bed scare it's much worse
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:50.920]  than that and now they're expanding terrorism to include anyone who speaks
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:56.360]  out in fact so this is the technique that they must use now until they finish
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:00.960]  this whole agenda and they even have environmental terrorism now if you don't
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:06.800]  put your garbage in the right boxes etc etc it all comes under terrorism so
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:11.400]  this is the noble lie that they're using to bring this whole agenda forward they
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:16.440]  must create a state of fear and when the public get into a state of panic and
[1:38:16.440 --> 1:38:21.640]  stampede as long as they are heading off the cattle at the head of the herd they
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:25.680]  can guide us into this new world order that's their whole theory that's what
[1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:31.160]  it's based upon and the public has got to stop being afraid and I've got to stop
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:36.320]  obeying ridiculous laws that are thrown at them because we know where it's to go
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:40.480]  is to go into an Orwellian world where you'll you'll need to believe in and
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:45.520]  speak double speak all the time to survive the cameras up where you any
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:52.360]  little expression that the deem might be anger or you're being upset means they
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:56.280]  have to get into you and intervene right away by drugging you or whatever is
[1:38:56.280 --> 1:39:00.640]  necessary this is the world they're bringing in total controls a hellish
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:05.600]  control where you have no freedom for to do anything whatsoever except that which
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:10.040]  is authorized by the top that was the next that was the next issue I was
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:14.160]  going to bring up the whole control grid they admit that in England in the
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:18.240]  United States the two major beta test centers Australia as well the Anglo-
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:24.480]  American system New Zealand Canada it's admitted that first they trained you how
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:27.520]  to go through a checkpoint research put yourself through a metal detector then
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:31.720]  they begin asking you questions then you take your shoes off an act of submission
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:35.600]  then you can't bring liquids in or toothpaste another act of submission
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:40.440]  you're gonna hold your pants up exactly show your body women have to drink the
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:46.040]  milk they've pumped for their baby next they are putting in at 200 airports in
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:51.200]  the US these body scanners that scan your 360 biometric signature so their
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:54.920]  cameras can now track and trace you another act of submission they admit
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:59.640]  it's the naked image of your body scanned onto their hard drives they now
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:02.040]  admit they're doing that and then now they're talking about putting metal
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:05.280]  detectors in shopping malls in the schools it's already happening
[1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:09.840]  thumb scanning to buy and sell cash being phased out by major airlines and
[1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:17.080]  businesses all Pavlovian dog training in their own words to train us to submit it
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:20.920]  now suddenly if you had an anti-bush sticker they would pull you over and
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:24.280]  take you to jail or ticket you were put you in a terror database in England they
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:26.560]  started that it happened to me when I was over there videotaping from the
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:30.720]  street now it's illegal in England to videotape anything an act of terrorism
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:34.440]  the police decide that if somebody can even find it on the web and use it that
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:39.960]  way you can't videotape them brutalizing people I mean it's all coming in to play
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:45.640]  now yes it is and once again it falls in with that you see there's actually
[1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:51.600]  handbooks on terrorism how to implement it and Russell Bertrand Russell had studied
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:57.280]  this technique and he said we must create a condition of apathy and as you
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:03.760]  say a buy by by ridiculing people are taking away their basic making them
[1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:08.480]  de-humiliating the public in other words as a greatest form of creating apathy
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:11.920]  they feel helpless just like the prison in fact you get a prisoner of war
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:15.920]  syndrome even though you're not behind bars you were walking in the general
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:20.080]  within the general public you get a syndrome that you get in prison camps
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:24.880]  where you feel apathetic and jaded and helpless helplessness is essential to
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:29.080]  control if you're using techniques of terrorism well the Marines brag about
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:32.920]  that when they dominate a population they want to teach them learn helplessness
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:37.920]  and they did studies where they have the puppies dog dish or the rats dish and
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:41.600]  every time they go over to eat they shock it and then it just learns to fall in
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:45.120]  the corner and that's the psych warfare system hitting us with all these
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:50.760]  threats and the dual pincers attack as the club of Rome wrote in 91 the
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:54.000]  republic last year in the council found relations with their chairman Richard
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:58.800]  in Haas who wrote it back in the early 90s that they will use the pincers of
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:01.920]  false environmentalism to teach us we're bad and that we're the enemy and the
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:04.680]  state's going to deal with us because we're bad for the earth and the other
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:09.000]  pincers of fake terrorism with those two pincers the left is into the
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:12.840]  environment pincers the right is into the law and order pincers with those
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:17.520]  pincers they've got us yes and we're doing across the world right now was
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:22.400]  another idea that dreamed up it was called a national group in the United
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:26.800]  States who are well funded to do so and it's called as called them a
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:31.840]  revolutionary democracy where they go across the world forcing countries by
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:36.480]  by literally bombing them into existence if necessary to accept this new
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:41.640]  idea of democracy so the standardizing the entire planet according to this
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:45.880]  agenda and anyone who won't go along with it is simply to be obliterated and
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:50.840]  that's what they're doing in the Middle East right now and in Afghanistan too
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:54.480]  absolutely I want to go to some phone calls Alan but there's a lot of other
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:59.320]  things going on in the world today you know the bad news is it's very serious
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:03.720]  what's happening the good news is we don't have a choice we have to resist
[1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:08.640]  this we have to say no to the system I mean are you not pleasantly pleased
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:13.480]  because I know I'm certainly seeing an explosive awakening this information you
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:16.920]  and I and others are putting out is the hottest info out there right now and
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:20.600]  it's not some fad it's reality it's people rediscovering reality and
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:24.480]  learning they're being bombarded by propaganda at every angle I mean I'm
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:28.520]  I'm I'm optimistic as darkest things are because I also know people in the elite
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:33.080]  structure themselves are becoming upset with what's happening and seeing their
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:38.040]  plan come to fruition a lot of them are two or three generation and you know
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:43.720]  it's it's alerting to them to want to come over to the light side it's very
[1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:46.440]  lonely for them and some of them aren't psychopaths they've been brought along
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:49.440]  through the system and tried to be you know trained and conditioned to enjoy
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:54.000]  predatory action against their own species but I see rebellion and resistance
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:59.440]  in every quarter yes and all have to increase and escalate as well and there
[1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:03.520]  will be martyrs there's always martyrs and you need martyrs as well to get the
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:07.280]  public on board and that will grow and grow and that's what they're terrified
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:12.600]  often factor is the creation of martyrs that's the greatest way to get the
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:18.280]  public turning against the tyrants and all ages so they're very very careful at
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:23.360]  that's why the feds bomb themselves on in Oklahoma City and bomb themselves on
[1:44:23.360 --> 1:44:29.680]  9-11 because they get to become the martyrs always oh we've got to have
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:33.280]  men in black uniforms searching you and beating your brains out in taser and
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:37.080]  you because al-qaeda will get you but suddenly they flipped it and said there's
[1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:41.120]  white al-qaeda there's black al-qaeda and north coms for the American people
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:44.360]  the other training police there's terrorists everywhere it's the troops
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:48.960]  that are coming home yes and also saying that anyone literally who is
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:54.360]  politically incorrect on any topic that the mandate is holy today as they're
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:59.080]  for also a terrorism terrorist has been expanded to include everyone who is
[1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:03.680]  against any part of the agenda I had a top lawyer on this a few weeks ago who
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:07.520]  was quoted in the LA Times and you know this big risk management lawyer out of
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:10.760]  New York and he admitted my analysis of section no 2 was accurate in the
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:16.680]  patriot act he said talking to an officer just responding or asking a
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:21.080]  question is an act of terrorism under the patriot act and is being used in
[1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:23.240]  thousands of cases per state per year
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:28.680]  mm-hmm absolutely and right now to the passing of these various omnibus bills
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:34.080]  and their one thousand two thousand ten thousand pages long no one reads them and
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:39.080]  all of these laws get put into action and then we're all bewildered where they
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:45.040]  all came from and why no politician ever debated them I mean I don't even know
[1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:48.520]  what the politicians are there for because like train seals to clap their
[1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:52.440]  their fins when the big man speaks at the top because they certainly don't do
[1:45:52.440 --> 1:46:01.800]  anything for the public because that's it yeah yeah big big clap for the boss
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:05.640]  man and the boss man it's like when Bush said to them don't read this patriot
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:10.680]  act bill because you'll be it'd be unpatriotic to do so well not as obama
[1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:16.200]  said that he was gonna stop bills not being read with pressure congress to give
[1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:19.640]  five days for to be read then he was instrumental in the first bailout as a
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:23.160]  senator not having it read saying we have to have it will be a depression on
[1:46:23.160 --> 1:46:27.080]  monday morning and then when they passed it it wasn't what they said it was and
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:30.880]  then now this week last week with the
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:34.920]  federalization bill really this call the stimulus package he said it's gotta be
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:38.200]  passed no one can read it they weren't allowed to read it it passed and he said
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:42.600]  I'm going on vacation for four days I'll sign it later talk about gangster you
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:47.200]  know saying we I mean just like yeah you had a chance to read it now you took
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:52.360]  my bag mm-hmm I know and at once again the public are over rules and everything
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:56.640]  there's no input there's no inquiry there's no I don't think the machinery
[1:46:56.640 --> 1:47:00.120]  didn't set up inquiries there as to why they keep passing these bills without
[1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:04.280]  reading them but that's not going to so much into the last omnibus bill they
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:08.200]  put through including that the tracking and tracing of everybody in the US
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:12.760]  psychological records for gun control like a logical and also to do with your
[1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:17.240]  health records and your DNA and everything else and you notice notice in
[1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:21.320]  Canada and in Austin Texas and all over there suddenly announcing all over the
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:26.640]  world on the same day oh we've been finding people not guilty who were in
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.760]  prison because of DNA and the police chiefs come out and say we need to take
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:35.680]  everybody's DNA every time they're given a misdemeanor because it'll save people
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:39.240]  they don't tell you police have been caught thousands of times using DNA
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:45.400]  samples to plant them on people yes yes as easy as thing to do corruption is all
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:48.480]  you see deception is the way the governments have always operated as
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:52.400]  always by deception there's nothing they can they will tell you that you can
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:56.840]  take us through unfortunately that's the way it really is that's a hard reality
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:01.080]  of life it's they're born liars hey why do you think the Austin police chiefs
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:05.960]  trying to cozy up to us while he's pushing all of this mm-hmm I don't know
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:10.240]  what his particular bent will be but I think it might end up like O'Brien when
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:14.160]  the I'm in the prison cell and the door opens and he walks in and I go they got
[1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:18.880]  you to and he goes yeah they got me a long time ago that's right that's right

[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:34.640]  do stand up for each other they do know how to keep secrets because it helps
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:39.960]  them on their career so we have a lot of this corruption too to be you cannot
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:44.520]  have a free society when you have fraternities or foundations with their
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:50.000]  own secret mandates no you can't they always overthrow the society let's go
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:55.760]  to the calls here for Ellen what cut into the matrix dot com Robin in Ohio

[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:33.360]  inspiration but I wanted to share one thing and I'll get off the horn golf
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:40.320]  war illness is real it's a November 18th article from McClatchy a lot of us
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.600]  already knew about the pyro bromide stigma tablets that we had to take when
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:51.240]  we were over in Iraq but never realized they sprayed us with pesticides yeah
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:55.720]  that's right they sprayed a cyanide base pesticide in the tanks and in the
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:59.640]  barracks knowing what it would do see the globalists in their own documents
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:03.280]  now I could speak to this don't like the military and so after they're done
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:06.840]  using you that they're going to psychologically not let them own guns
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:11.440]  that's now being announced phasing that in they give the inoculations that are
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:16.080]  soft kill that are designed to kill the troops within 20 to 25 years they have
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:19.480]  them around the DU which their own admissions says is gonna kill anybody
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:24.680]  that breathes it just from the particulate size and poison level alone
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:28.400]  and so absolutely they're now admitting they're going to take the pensions of
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:34.160]  World War two Korean War and Vietnam vets and so trashing the troops they
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:38.840]  also blew up the chemistry of chemical weapons dump and you know the troops
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:41.960]  have nerve damage from that and a bio weapon was released we're not sure who
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:46.880]  by who the microplasm incognitas those little micro plasms that live inside
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:52.080]  bacteria and they were carrying a HIV like autoimmune system in the Anderson
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:56.440]  confirmed this within them strangely enough my dad when he was at UT and

[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:45.120]  decade major universities and scientific institutions have done autopsies on them
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:49.840]  the Marines the army forces will shrivel up they'll be in wheelchairs and they'll
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:55.240]  tell them you're not sick here's Prozac you're mentally ill then they put them on
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:58.920]  databases so they can't buy firearms even though there's no law to do that they
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:02.360]  just go to do the instant check and can't get them and then they die they go in
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:05.760]  coffins they go in the ground mission accomplished get rid of the troops
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:11.040]  after you've used them and just like the police and military and the rescue
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:15.600]  workers on 9-11 their lungs full of asbestos major you know institutions
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:19.040]  did the CAT scans it's there they're dying I mean I've interviewed these
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:22.200]  police and people and you'll try to call them up later and they're dead they'll
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:25.000]  have them on people that are in truth rising a bunch of them that you see at
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.600]  that press conference at the Capitol trying to get funding they're dead
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:30.960]  government says hey there was no dust not bad for you you're not gonna get
[1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:36.840]  treatment this is done scientifically isn't an Alan yes because after the
[1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:41.120]  Vietnam War in fact during it the government did surveys into the
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:45.520]  aftermath of the war especially with the protest back home they were afraid
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:50.840]  that the young people who are very fit well trained in military strategy could
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:56.720]  get formed within civilian life within civilian street and and be a force to be
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:01.880]  reckoned with against government or government policy so they they come up
[1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:06.520]  with the idea the best way to do it is to use them in the military but cripple
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:11.440]  them at the same time so they're useless when they come out someone who's got
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:16.080]  chronic fatigue or various other illnesses is unlikely to join a group and
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:19.840]  be any threat to the government. AMD Anderson and others would go into their
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:23.720]  brain stems there'd be chemical weapon in there or they'd go into their joints
[1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:26.960]  it'd be filled with micro plasms yeah and there's even the patent for the
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:30.840]  bioweapon yes and I've talked to some of the troops that came back to who were
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:34.840]  told to take certain pills every day they were they were not told what they
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:39.600]  were and the sergeants would actually inspect their mouths to make sure they
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:43.760]  swallowed them so there's a lot of experimentation going on as well within
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:46.640]  the military they don't even know what pills they're taking of what their father
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:49.840]  is experiments for sure and now we have evidence they're giving the police the
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:53.560]  soft-kill weapons don't laugh police you better investigate this if you care
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:57.640]  about your own life does that go along the lines of what you were bringing up
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:01.640]  Robin with what happened to you in the Gulf War well yes sir actually what
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:07.940]  happened to myself my platoon leader's wife worked at the hospital in
[1:57:07.940 --> 1:57:14.920]  Clarksville Tennessee home of the 101st Airborne Division who and over a fat
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:20.760]  phone she called him and said whatever you do do not take those because they're
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:26.880]  they've never been approved by the FDA at that point and the only military in
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:31.920]  the world that actually took those was the Israeli military and so I pretty
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:40.080]  much cease and desist that after five five tablets so I was done so but the
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:45.360]  camera see a thing the 101st Airborne it was a guy in my squad that called the
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:51.960]  entire division Michael Williams Brooklyn New York to mop level 4 because his
[1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:58.440]  M8 detector went off and 14 minutes later they said stand down and blew up
[1:57:58.440 --> 1:58:01.600]  the chemical weapons dump and then told people stand down take your mask off
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:07.380]  yes sir that that actually occurred and I had a conversation with David von
[1:58:07.380 --> 1:58:13.120]  Kleist of the power hour dot com and he said you know what was on Robin is that
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:19.560]  14,000 detectors according to the Army Times just malfunction that's right the
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:24.960]  Army Times reported 14,000 detectors malfunctioned nerve gas hit them and a
[1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:29.320]  nice soft kill a lot of them are dead or in wheelchairs sorry to hear that

[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:37.600]  picking up now that uh... barack obama's in office because i know
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:41.320]  i'm a black man myself and i know that this is just dangerous dangerous like
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:42.320]  warfare
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:46.000]  on not only the black community just america in the world in general
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.600]  so i want to talk about it
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:49.000]  um...
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:50.240]  i've watched
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:51.440]  three things
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:55.000]  on television the other day and i don't watch television that much so this
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:56.320]  just stuck out to me
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:01:59.120]  i don't know if you've seen it but the insurance dot com
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:00.520]  the insurance company
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:03.880]  they have a commercial out uh... talking about earth power i don't know if you
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:05.040]  couldn't know about that
[2:02:05.040 --> 2:02:08.480]  but they want to people to turn off all their lights for one hour all around
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:09.480]  the world
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:11.280]  so it's just one of those
[2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:14.400]  you know yet it came out that in ronba did that in california
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:16.960]  saying there was no power to create the perception
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:20.800]  of artificial scarcity so that people would accept higher prices it's all
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:22.560]  about training us to have
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:25.840]  less resources alan what can you speak to that
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:29.480]  yes they want to cut us back drastically from her present power consumption
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:31.240]  and all energy in fact
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:34.400]  and it was in with agenda twenty one of the united nations
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:37.040]  where they want us all living in compact cities
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:38.640]  really overcrowded cities
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:41.600]  and the bill uh... private transportation

[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:54.160]  maybe once per week maybe twice per week and to give you the time to be out
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:58.440]  so this is all part of this this so-called conservation tactic and they say
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:01.760]  they've got to have their phony environmental takeover
[2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:05.440]  uh... because they want to actually control new energy so they can suppress

[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:33.080]  the fact that he was a globalist in the front man running nothing
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:35.480]  will be obama knowledge now that
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:38.240]  uh... he has betrayed everything he said he would do
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:39.920]  uh... are they going to wake up
[2:09:39.920 --> 2:09:42.480]  now it's like you have me on i appreciate me they will come down here
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:46.320]  again eyes as far as obama's concern you know the thing about him he hit the
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:47.560]  ground running
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:50.040]  you know uh... he was
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:52.080]  brought up in in the uh...
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.760]  brzezinski rockefeller school he's there
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:09:58.640]  he's their boy i'd say use the word boy but he is their boy
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:00.320]  and uh... uh...
[2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:04.240]  he's kind of like bill clinton without the sexual baggage is definitely their
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:07.680]  boy we have a bit of all of these presidents and scanty are there their
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:12.440]  menu this guy you know he's he's taking the the used car salesman uh... to a
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:14.120]  new level actually
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:17.440]  you know he's so slick and he's slicker than slick willy ever was
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:20.880]  because he doesn't have all that that baggage from being the governor of
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.480]  arkansas you know
[2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:23.160]  although
[2:10:23.160 --> 2:10:25.480]  though the ladies and all the other stuff so
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:29.240]  he's hit the ground running and he's done everything that
[2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:30.720]  we've said he was going to do
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:34.040]  he's just streaming lies everything coming out of his mouth
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:35.360]  is a lie
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:38.440]  and he's he's betraying all the things he said during the campaign
[2:10:38.440 --> 2:10:39.080]  and
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:42.160]  i mean why not we knew that was going to happen it's just a con job we've we've
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:44.720]  known it as part of the agenda for years
[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:46.880]  uh... you know carol quigley's book
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:50.600]  uh... tragedy and hope he spells it out he says you can throw the bums out every
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:54.040]  four years if you want to we don't care we got control of both sides
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:10:56.200]  and you won't affect any change at all
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:10:57.160]  you know so yeah
[2:10:57.160 --> 2:11:01.080]  uh... good luck everybody i mean just and are they gonna wake up
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:04.640]  well if they buy the obama deception they probably will you know
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:07.720]  get that get that going they won't have to buy it'll be all over the web but
[2:11:07.720 --> 2:11:08.680]  absolutely
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:12.280]  uh... bob let's go through from your perspective and he lied about lobbyist
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:14.400]  that's all he seems to be appointing his lobbyist
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:16.800]  he lied about appointing donors uh... you know that's the other half he's
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:17.640]  appointing
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.160]  he lied about uh... ending the war first it was instantly than six months in
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:22.160]  sixteen months
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:23.560]  and twenty one months
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:26.520]  and he's increasing the troops massively in afghanistan
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:29.920]  uh... he uh... lied about waiting five days uh...
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:31.680]  for a bill to be read before
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:35.600]  uh... it should be passed and he said don't read it you gotta pass the stimulus
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:36.520]  now
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:40.280]  uh... he has literally a lot about everything so he's shut down guantanamo
[2:11:40.280 --> 2:11:43.280]  but it really says they're gonna look at shutting up to keep other camps open
[2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:47.040]  and continue the practice of rendition or kidnapping you forgot one of the
[2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:50.880]  other lives i mean he he lied about his intentions in regard to uh... uh... the
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:52.520]  second amendment gun control
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:55.560]  over over during the campaign so though you you people don't have anything to
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:11:57.040]  worry about for me
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:00.480]  well guess what you don't find out that was wrong to because his attorney general
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:04.160]  holder argued before the supreme court last year in the dc gunman that no
[2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:10.800]  citizen be allowed to own any firearm he is for complete and total abolition of
[2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:15.840]  citizens right to defense and then it just expands out he said he was against
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:19.680]  naftan gap now he says that was his campaign rhetoric i mean the lies are
[2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:23.680]  legion holder said in the in his amicus brief to the supreme court in the
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:24.800]  heller case
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:27.600]  that he did not see in the constitution
[2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:29.800]  a right an individual right
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:33.360]  to keep and bear an arm in your own home
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:36.640]  so i would have to ask the attorney general united states
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:39.640]  he believes that you don't have the right to keep and bear arms in your own
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:42.360]  home than where exactly
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:45.600]  geographically would you have a right to keep and bear them
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:50.400]  i think we know the answer to that well he's got firearms he's got bodyguards
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:54.560]  you know i better than you now it's come out the sero brady who wants to disarm us
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.000]  she's got bodyguards yes she got a i think one of her kids got a gun
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:01.280]  surreptitiously through her one time a few years ago is quite embarrassing you
[2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:02.040]  know
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:03.760]  didn't go through instant check
[2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:07.240]  you know i mean the whole the whole the whole thing is a farce alex
[2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:09.280]  but we do it's like the politicians
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:13.040]  uh... most it's come out the news the majority of congress doesn't pay
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:17.200]  income taxes he keeps having to get rid of his appointees because they don't pay
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:19.880]  taxes the new the guy running the treasury
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:24.600]  uh... geithner doesn't pay his taxes but that's okay so tell me how that isn't
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:27.480]  the the pinnacle of hypocrisy
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:30.800]  got geithner is is supposed to run the treasury department the treasury
[2:13:30.800 --> 2:13:33.320]  department sits on top of the irs
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:35.560]  his deal is like who cares
[2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:38.480]  but some of the other so-called appointees they forgot a few things and
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:42.400]  all weekend they can't serve office but the guy who's going to run the irs is
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:46.040]  okay that he doesn't pay his taxes and he's one of the guys in the nineties
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:49.640]  along with summers and greenspan all of them that change the
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:53.320]  last eagle act in others so the banks could set up these ponzi schemes with
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:54.240]  derivatives
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:56.480]  and these financial instruments
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:00.120]  yeah it's is basically alex what we're talking about is a bunch of art criminals
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:04.280]  i've got another obama line i've got one of the bigger ones
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:07.120]  he said that uh...
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:10.440]  he was putting caps on cio salaries which is
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:14.080]  actually bad enough is socialism and fascism and control but he doesn't doing
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:14.480]  that
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:16.680]  even mainstream media had to admit
[2:14:16.680 --> 2:14:20.440]  all the major banks and brokerage firms were exempt and smaller firms in the
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:22.280]  future it would be on the honor
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:24.440]  system so we get some says hey
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:26.360]  this is a quote this is outrageous
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:29.680]  these people we like to reward uh... success in this country but rewarding
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:30.520]  failure
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:32.800]  with these hundred million dollar bonuses and things
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:34.000]  it's wrong and hey
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:35.040]  we're putting into it
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:38.160]  and then you read the executive order that says that's not going to do anything
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:40.960]  i mean this is uh... i have to tell you right
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:42.160]  he is worse
[2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:44.480]  the slick will he is worse than george bush
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:48.200]  i mean he is taken arrogant hundred percent lying
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:51.560]  well i don't know ladies all i'm gonna help you man don't worry i'm on a
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:54.440]  i mean he knows that he's slitting their throat politically
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:57.820]  absolutely the guy the guy is a walking talking
[2:14:57.820 --> 2:15:00.600]  line machine but again it's the same old thing
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:03.200]  you keep saying it over and over and over again when you change the
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:05.120]  ministrations as management team a
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:08.360]  being replaced by management team b and in the republicans who are in power they
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:10.000]  go back into the foundations
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:11.200]  incorporations
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:13.520]  and the democrats that were in the foundations and corporations they go
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:16.140]  into government and then when the democrats leave the republicans will
[2:15:16.140 --> 2:15:17.080]  come back out
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:18.520]  so you've got cf r
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:21.000]  and trial lateral commission bill burr group team a
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:24.880]  and trial lateral commission cfr bill burr group team b and they just rotate
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:26.520]  and it's a cash machine between them
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:31.520]  yeah and brzezinski for example he he plays both sides of the of the issue he
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:32.520]  was uh...
[2:15:32.520 --> 2:15:35.960]  mccain's advisor back in two thousand brzezinski
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:37.760]  and he's obama's advisor
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:38.720]  last year
[2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:42.560]  i mean come on and now he's concerned he's very concerned about the elite
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:43.360]  bankers
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:47.480]  and and how there's going to be civil war in america just read brzezinski anybody
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:48.200]  who doesn't
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:52.280]  want to believe this just read brzezinski the guy is a marxist
[2:15:52.280 --> 2:15:55.520]  and he and he's proud of it and he claims he's anti-communist and wants to
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:58.520]  blow russia the kingdom come sure he is
[2:15:58.520 --> 2:16:00.400]  again again consummate
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:02.440]  liars
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:05.480]  and with the thing you know when i first met you alex
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:08.440]  you know you were kind of over the top for me because i was a conservative
[2:16:08.440 --> 2:16:09.880]  republican type
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:13.200]  and always checked out everything you said because you know whatever it was i
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:16.200]  didn't believe it always had to check it out
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:18.720]  the problem is everything you said turned out to be right
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:22.000]  and it and it it finally got through to me that maybe i'll stop bothering to
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:23.200]  check out what you say
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:25.880]  now you should always check out i still do
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:29.600]  i still do you'll find even more of what i'm saying but the problem is all of
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:32.360]  these years all the stuff you said in some of the stuff that you said it was
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:34.000]  like wild out there
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:37.120]  is in our face right now
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:38.600]  and
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:41.640]  it's it's frightening and and you're saying you always say well i'm not
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:43.440]  brilliant i just read their stuff
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:47.280]  and it is true you document your stuff you read their documents you look at the
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:48.840]  reports you go to the
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:54.320]  known the war the army's own deal about the prison camps you read about that
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:57.440]  i remember but back when i first met you were screaming about having to get a
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:16:58.680]  driver's license
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:17:02.320]  and how it was a federal program it was all illegal federal standardized
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:05.920]  biometrics for pentagon control and now they admit all that yeah and now they
[2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:08.360]  admit all that and so
[2:17:08.360 --> 2:17:09.320]  you know
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:13.080]  what's going on here you obviously know what's going on and and
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:17.240]  your success as a as a broadcaster i think mirrors the fact that you've been
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.360]  telling the truth all these years
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:22.720]  well there's a lot of cointel pro attacks on us to and that's why i just
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:24.840]  asked people to realize there's an agenda
[2:17:24.840 --> 2:17:27.520]  judge a tree by its fruits and we have been very successful
[2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:30.040]  and reaching people and that's how we gauge success
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:32.600]  not monetarily but by how many people we reach
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:35.560]  and we have reached hundreds and hundreds of millions of people
[2:17:35.560 --> 2:17:38.000]  and that's what's exciting and we have over a hundred and twenty thousand
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:39.960]  downloads a day to the free podcast
[2:17:39.960 --> 2:17:43.480]  were number one on shoutcasts for internet radio show and not just for
[2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:44.960]  music but talk
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:49.000]  uh... we we are reaching more and more people on the amon f m dial with mom and
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:50.320]  pop stations that put us on
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:53.640]  but what i'm most proud of that i've been able to do
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:55.200]  the reason i'm talking about this is because
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:17:58.160]  the tb cameras are here and want me to talk about what we've done
[2:17:58.160 --> 2:18:03.080]  is that so many people young old black white you know in in israel or saudi
[2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:04.880]  arabia or in germany
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:10.340]  uh... or in china or japan or mexico or canada u s
[2:18:10.340 --> 2:18:14.440]  they they start radio shows they make successful films they
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:18.520]  they make documentaries uh... they run for office they defeat
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:20.220]  criminal legislation
[2:18:20.220 --> 2:18:23.360]  and they tell me alex it was your show your films
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:25.800]  i'm talking over eighty percent of the time i say what woke you up with a
[2:18:25.800 --> 2:18:27.000]  volunteer it
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:32.320]  and to me that's a microcosm of what all of this new alternative media is doing
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:35.920]  they are sparing people not to even buy their line of information
[2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:37.240]  is none of us are infallible
[2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:40.680]  you know all of us look through rose colored uh... you know uh... darkly
[2:18:40.680 --> 2:18:41.800]  but
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:43.320]  that they are now
[2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:47.000]  generating and spawning whole new generations of people and it's
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:51.520]  exponential and so to to to realize the power of the human spirit in the power
[2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:52.680]  of taking action
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:55.960]  that's what's exciting and because you know you woke me up back in nineteen
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:18:58.880]  ninety-eight and i was dragged kicking and screaming and all this from our
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:01.760]  conservative republican slumber that i was in
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:05.680]  and as a result of that you know i got this local tv show the simple truth i've
[2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:08.400]  been on the air for ten years now almost
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:12.120]  and now through totally few volunteer efforts we've got a we've got a website
[2:19:12.120 --> 2:19:14.080]  simple truth online dot net
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:17.480]  and they are kind of our tv and i write for the new american magazine reaching
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:18.360]  millions
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:19.600]  uh... you know you're
[2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:22.880]  you're having a huge effect yeah and i'm just a guy who owns a hardware store you
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:23.440]  know
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:24.080]  i mean
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:27.520]  think about that just so i don't think the elite teachers that we have to only
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:29.640]  listen to their experts in their people
[2:19:29.640 --> 2:19:33.720]  uh... and that we're all a bunch of idiots instead it really is the people
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:36.000]  that uh... you know that's where the answer space
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:39.600]  i want to get into how you think this is going to go with obama their front man
[2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:40.560]  we need to stress
[2:19:40.560 --> 2:19:43.240]  he's just a pathetic puppet just like george bush and when they're done with
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:43.880]  him
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:45.800]  they're gonna blame their whole agenda on him
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:49.640]  pull him out like birdcage liner and put in a new republican clean birdcage
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:50.400]  liner
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:52.240]  then the new world order birds gonna
[2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:56.480]  destroy that they'll put in a new minion we've got to quit this groundhog day
[2:19:56.480 --> 2:19:58.680]  of over and over and over again
[2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:05.680]  buying the same garbage as they put their puppet on the left or right
[2:20:06.080 --> 2:20:08.960]  unemployment is soaring over ten percent
[2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:14.400]  the dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors
[2:20:14.400 --> 2:20:18.360]  financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression

[2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:24.360]  I'll tell you what's really disgusting to me Bob is to have the FBI put out
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:28.480]  training manual saying you're an insane person if you believe in a new world
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:33.920]  order system that world government doesn't exist that people that believe
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:36.920]  that there's international banks setting up a structure of world government
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:40.880]  undermined sovereignty doesn't exist and then strobe Talbot Newsweek decades
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:43.680]  ago wrote they were doing this and he was made under Secretary of State by
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:50.680]  Clinton now in literally hundreds of mainstream news articles hundreds and
[2:24:50.680 --> 2:24:53.920]  hundreds they're saying oh there's a global banking crisis the answer is a
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:59.280]  bank of the world time magazine Wall Street Journal hundreds and it's going
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:04.200]  to save you and you'll pay carbon taxes to the bankers but the FBI is still
[2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:08.120]  harassing people that even talk about this trying to create a chilling effect
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:12.640]  I mean talk about double thing they even admit it I mean they they flat out
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:17.920]  admitted Christopher Hayes of the nation magazine told me flat out he
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:23.480]  admitted yes there there is a contingent of the elitist who believed that the
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:26.920]  whole world would be better run by a bunch of bankers and international
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:31.840]  businessmen yes this is true I mean they flat admitted now but but to them it's
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:35.760]  a good thing it's it's great I mean why not I mean you know the rest of us are
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:38.560]  peons you know but then he wrote an article basically saying there was a
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:42.680]  North American Union he said his article from year and a half ago was that
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:48.040]  the there was a trans-Texas corridor being being going to be built but there
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:52.680]  was no NAFTA superhighway there was a even though you had the Fed saying 34
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:56.760]  interstate highways international zones for international taxation the SPP
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:25:59.200]  documents they just know we're not writing about that even though they
[2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:04.920]  changed the laws to allow the tolling of previously non-tollable infrastructure
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:09.480]  you know both in the in the United States and then of course they did in
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:15.080]  Texas they were trying to told the interstate system within Texas I mean
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:18.200]  look they they do all this stuff and then they just sit there and they think
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:21.280]  we're a bunch of idiots we'll take David Rockefeller what he said before the
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:26.240]  Bilderberg group and then similar stem before the Toronto Commission in 91 he
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:30.080]  laid out the elites ultimate goal he said quote the super national sovereignty
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:34.920]  of an international again quoting the super national sovereignty of an
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:39.400]  intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:43.400]  auto-determination practice in the last centuries yeah that's just standard new
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:47.400]  world order speak 101 and of course you know the other famous quote from from
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:50.800]  David Rockefeller who's like the poster child of the bad guys the Omni
[2:26:50.800 --> 2:26:55.200]  Budsman yeah as far as we're concerned I mean in his own book memoirs on page
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:59.360]  405 he states that there's a bunch of crazy people who think that I'm part of
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:02.720]  an international cabal working against the best interest of the United States
[2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:06.640]  of America in order to form a one-world government and then he says hey if that's
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:10.720]  the charge I stand guilty and I'm proud of it I mean right right there in your
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:14.640]  face we can play a clip of Walter Cronkite saying world government must
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:18.680]  must be set up yeah yeah and you know there's and there's an example right
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:23.760]  there are media lies I mean they they people like Rockefeller people like
[2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:27.920]  people that control you know the new the elites they control the media and the
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:33.400]  media is it's nothing but a lie machine you asked me to come in here talk about
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:37.520]  the mainstream media a little bit today the whole thing is a lie machine all you
[2:27:37.520 --> 2:27:42.880]  gotta do is pick up the paper open it up and you will find lies of all sorts
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:45.840]  there's like four different four five different kinds that they just spew out
[2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:49.720]  a lot of it spin they'll see isn't it great we're gonna take your DNA every
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:53.000]  time you're arrested for any misdemeanor to keep you safe but we know that it's
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.560]  to control an example example of spin for example though they will tell you like
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:28:01.280]  in the paper the other day I've got it from here in the statesman US cancer
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:05.040]  rate on decline for the first time deaths also drop and they say it's a
[2:28:05.040 --> 2:28:09.160]  long-awaited turning point and the and the cancer rate deaths have dropped to
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.160]  percent and a half whoopee but but but who carried away that's only certain
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:20.360]  types yeah overall cancer diagnosis is way up I know they lie a few years a few
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:25.480]  months ago they had an article saying that when only 550,000 people croaked a
[2:28:25.480 --> 2:28:31.080]  cancer as opposed to 560,000 people the previous year the death rate has
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:37.240]  plummeted now you talk about spin well I mean let's go further one if you go
[2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:44.120]  back to the 1950s numbers one out of 33 would die of cancer now one of three
[2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:48.320]  die of cancer and they and then they also spend the numbers and say people
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:52.960]  are living longer today but that's not true if you take out infant mortality
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:57.840]  because previously around 30 to 40% of children would die by age 5 but then if
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:01.240]  you made it past that you would end up living longer up until your 80s on
[2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:05.280]  average now it's down in the mid 70s because we do have a lower infant
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:08.560]  mortality so so they also cook the numbers yeah so but again that's and
[2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:12.840]  that's a form of spin but you know spin is one way they lie that my favorite
[2:29:12.840 --> 2:29:16.800]  well I don't know my favorite one of the main way they lie is by omission they
[2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:21.640]  don't cover the news and if you want examples of them not covering the news
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:26.360]  all you got to do is go to info wars.com or say what really happened.com and look
[2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:29.360]  at the news that's there and then see if it's in the mainstream media and you'll
[2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:33.680]  find out it's not there they're just lie about omission they don't want you to
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:37.400]  know about it just pull the blanket over your head yeah or they'll lie and say
[2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:42.560]  Iraq has WMD's yeah and now they're saying Iran's got WMD's and it's got to
[2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:45.920]  be attacked all right we'll be right back over this quick break with your

[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:32.560]  I want you to go through some of those and then let's get into how they're
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:36.600]  trying to shut down the alternative media we're talking about lies and the
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:41.080]  media let's just pick one what about the bailout coverage I remember the last
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:44.920]  time I was live in studio with you was the day that the House of Representatives
[2:35:44.920 --> 2:35:48.520]  rejected the initial bailout I think I was like September the 30th or something
[2:35:48.520 --> 2:35:54.320]  like that I went home and I watched the the news and they were saying that they
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:58.800]  saw the stock market drop after the the house rejected the bailout package and
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:04.240]  the media was saying listen look how look at look at the dollar value we lost
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:08.760]  in the market because you didn't vote for this thing it was more than the
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:12.960]  bailout I mean they actually presented that as if that if that was some sort of
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:16.000]  a cause-and-effect relationship or actually had a meaning and that was
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:19.480]  financial terrorism what really happened is having the president and Obama and
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:22.600]  and the head of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department come out and
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:26.840]  say we're going into a depression if you don't pass this will be destroyed by
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:30.800]  next Monday that destroyed confidence in the market dropped and it's dropped
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:35.920]  2,000 points almost since that point and then the day after they pass it they
[2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:40.680]  say oh we're not going to use it anymore to buy up a bad debt from these
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:44.360]  mortgages we're not going to say where it's going you know and where was the
[2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:48.720]  screaming banner headlines in the media that day they were lying to us they're
[2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:51.800]  not going to they're not going to bail out the crooked the bad mortgages where
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:55.680]  was it it was nowhere the spin was elsewhere that's a that's a that's a
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:37:00.800]  little bit on from the 9.7 trillion banker takeover not 800 billion
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:04.720]  Bloomberg reported 9.7 they won't see where the money went to should we give
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:08.320]  $50 billion to the auto companies a pittance and made it all the debate
[2:37:08.320 --> 2:37:13.360]  about that as a diversion I mean you take take the fluoride coverage oh I'm
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:17.520]  sorry what fluoride coverage where is that I mean there's tons of evidence
[2:37:17.520 --> 2:37:21.040]  about how bad for the feds have spent billions of dollars forcing this in our
[2:37:21.040 --> 2:37:25.200]  water and where and where is the front page media coverage giving fair
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:30.240]  presentation to this it's not there where where is it instead of the name of
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:34.880]  being fair Clinton Hillary and Bill Clinton a bunch of us senators are
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:37.720]  saying we're not just going to have fairness doctrine and control what you
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:42.120]  can say and do on the radio we're going to do it on the internet and Canada's
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:44.760]  announced they're about to start censoring the internet to only a few
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:49.200]  thousand websites it's actually in the Toronto Star yeah and take a look at the
[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:52.600]  vaccine thing I mean just the other day in the paper that they they're saying
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:55.720]  right here in the statesman that the evidence fails to link autism to
[2:37:55.720 --> 2:38:01.360]  vaccines court declares so a court has ruled that there is there's no evidence
[2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:06.440]  linking autism to vaccine that of court and then out of hundreds of studies
[2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:09.640]  including government's government studies showing that mercury does cause
[2:38:09.640 --> 2:38:13.800]  brain damage and goes to the blood-brain barrier they ignore those and use one
[2:38:13.800 --> 2:38:18.520]  guy who claims he found evidence it was autism to have him say he faked it as if
[2:38:18.520 --> 2:38:25.160]  it's all discredited yeah as if we haven't gone in 1975 from one and well
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:31.720]  what's the number I'm gonna put the exact number one in 2600 having autism to
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:37.000]  now one and 87 yeah and take any any issue the global warming issue for
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:42.280]  example I mean the media presents global warming as if it is a fact and that
[2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:45.200]  polar bear and that polar bears can't swim and that and that there's no day
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:48.880]  no debating there's no there's nothing you can say it's a fact and you people
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:53.120]  got to deal with it and that we caused it you know I've got some quotes here
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:57.440]  from some very famous scientists who just laugh at the at that assertion you
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:03.320]  know from the new american here's one from a doctor in norwee in norweeja
[2:39:03.320 --> 2:39:07.240]  norwee I'm sorry Norwegian doctor he says quote anyone who claims that the
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:11.960]  debate is over and that the conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:17.080]  approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time and here's one from
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:22.160]  US government atmospheric scientist Stanley B goldenberg of the hurricane
[2:39:22.160 --> 2:39:25.600]  research division of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration
[2:39:25.600 --> 2:39:31.280]  quote it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem like it is
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:36.040]  only a fringe of scientists who don't buy into anthropological global warming
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:40.560]  I mean come on because it goes in a 10,000 year cycle yeah the last bronze
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:45.680]  age started during a 3,000 year warming period and then they had a mini warm
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:51.200]  period about a thousand years ago and they were growing grapes all over
[2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:55.400]  England where you can't even grow grapes today and they know this from the ice
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:59.120]  core samples they understand this and then the UN claim they had 2400
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:03.720]  scientists that had signed on saying man made global warming was real and then
[2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:06.160]  they went and question the scientists the scientists had no we were just invited
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:10.120]  to a conference I don't agree with this so they say everyone agrees that all
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:12.960]  these scientists tens of thousands come out and say no we don't and they say
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:16.920]  well everybody who's credible agrees then they claim you're funded by the oil
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:23.600]  companies if you cite the science that the entire solar system has been heating
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:27.200]  up and now the sun just cooled off so suddenly the solar system is cool now
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:31.120]  here's a quote from a doctor David G the chairman of the science committee of
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:36.160]  the 2008 International Geological Congress listen this quote for how many
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:39.400]  years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:44.080]  not warming for how many come on that's a funny isn't it funny isn't that
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:48.000]  hilarious the things cooling down now but you know they shifted now they've
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:52.120]  shifted to one that was global warming is your fault Alex but now it might be
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:55.880]  global cooling and it's still your fault Alex and they're saying it's climate
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:00.560]  change as if we don't have four seasons as if we haven't always gone through
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:06.760]  cycles they can't even predict the weather in Austin Texas a week from now
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:11.440]  accurate for the same part about it is that they've built this carbon-based
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:15.360]  economy and I'm not even saying oil is a good system because it's toxic and it's
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:21.960]  in its in the cracking and the refining of it but but the point here is is that
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:24.960]  you know when the Super Bowl and Exxon mobile are telling you global warming
[2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:29.760]  is real and we need a tax that it's a scam and and then Al Gore with the
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:33.800]  World Bank and the IMF owns the major company that we will buy carbon credits
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:39.720]  from this guy stands to any by the way he owns an oil company Al Gore is an
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:44.160]  oilman he owns an oil company Al Gore owns the garbage from the major carpet
[2:41:44.160 --> 2:41:48.760]  carbon trading company that we're going to buy our carbon credits from me think
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:53.960]  about that Al Gore owns the major carbon trading company that we will buy
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:56.920]  carbon credits from and here's another one let's say global warming is real
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:42:01.240]  it's all man-made it's all true nobody's lying you know the polar bears can't
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:04.880]  swim you know the glaciers are all melting we're all dead unless we have
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:09.560]  this tax they admit that it'll only be on western nations and so the
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:13.920]  industry will move to China and India and 160 of the third world countries that
[2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:19.440]  will have no emissions controls so emissions will actually go up so explain
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:24.320]  to me and explain to your audience Alex how a factory in the United States which
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:29.600]  is producing widgets which has the EPA crawling all over them all the time how
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:33.880]  moving that factory to China so they can produce those widgets over there with no
[2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:38.800]  EPA crawling over them all the time how does that save the planet tell me no it
[2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:42.200]  ups the level of carbon which if you look at the studies is actually good we
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:45.280]  need to have some warming because we're going into this new ice age I know the
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:51.440]  logic is too too too basic but I wish I wish humans could we're actually had an
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:54.800]  effect and we're warming because every study shows that all plant life and
[2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:58.920]  animal life does better during these warming periods unfortunately the sun
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:02.680]  cool down and we're going into a cooling period and the bottom line ladies and
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:08.240]  gentlemen is that the human cause of global warming or global cooling take
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:13.240]  your pick less than 1% is a crock it's all meant to make you think you've got a
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:17.960]  lawyer standard of living and they brag and say that yeah absolutely that's the
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:22.440]  thing these arrogant bastards admit that this is a scam and they think we're so
[2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:26.120]  ignorant we can't figure it out remember when I had Rothschild on two years ago
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:30.680]  it's an endgame and he said no he said he didn't even know the solar system I
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:34.160]  said why are the moons of Jupiter and Saturn melting the ones that are covered
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:39.280]  with methane ice why are the ice caps on Mars getting smaller and he said well
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:44.240]  number one of that Mars Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun than Earth
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:48.800]  I heard him say I said no sir merc it goes Mercury Venus Earth Mars and then
[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:51.800]  out and he said no you're wrong and laughed at me because he knew the
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:56.080]  audience or he thought they were he knows the general public he knew is so dumb
[2:43:56.080 --> 2:44:01.800]  down just just desperately dumb down that and I got emails saying that Mars is
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:06.080]  closer to the Sun I have I have been convinced by many years of watching the
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:11.760]  mainstream media that my truck is the cause of the melting of the polar ice
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:16.360]  caps of Mars I sincerely believe that because I watch the mainstream media I
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:20.520]  know it's my truck the polar bears are gonna drown on Mars because absolutely
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:24.080]  man I'll tell you what I mean to believe this stuff you got to be you got to be
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:28.920]  just not listen that's what club of Rome said we need a new religion so we're
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:32.640]  getting rid of the geo-christian system we have a religion based on humans or
[2:44:32.640 --> 2:44:36.480]  bad so the state can wage war against humanity I mean that's a quote and the
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:39.920]  bottom and the bottom line here is when you have a group of people who think
[2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:44.520]  that humanity is scum and they want to run the planet guess what ladies and
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:49.080]  gentlemen we have a problem we got a problem
[2:44:49.760 --> 2:44:53.520]  absolutely let's take some phone calls Matt in Illinois you're on the air
[2:44:53.520 --> 2:45:00.960]  worldwide hello Alex hello sir hi I just like to start my call by saying I'm
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:06.800]  22 and I think all this stuff is unfair and so yeah so I started on listening
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:11.760]  to your show like in 2006 2005 and like I you know talked on the internet about it
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:18.200]  and someone bugged my house and I was just wondering if you've had
[2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:23.080]  similar experiences with that well sir I don't know what particularly happened to
[2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:28.680]  you but we're all bugged Google admits and yahoo admits they have patents and
[2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:34.080]  are doing it with the on-board microphone in all new computers and the
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:39.400]  little camera about and now Apple has a patent they're coming out with it where
[2:45:39.400 --> 2:45:43.400]  the screen itself is a camera so you can't escape it who's at home I put a
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:47.080]  piece of tape over it and they admit that AI computers they say don't worry
[2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:52.160]  human isn't listening AI computers are dialing in and listening for keywords
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:56.680]  and they hear a dog barking in your house Google ads for dog food or dog
[2:45:56.680 --> 2:46:00.880]  health care products or dog frisbees that this is Google saying this isn't me
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:05.640]  pop up and you tell somebody that and they just can't believe it or I told
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:09.360]  people on Star was being used for the FBI and others to dial in without warrants
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:13.400]  and listen to you because it's an audio system on a cell phone base or I tell
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:16.680]  people about all this they can't believe it and then the media instead of
[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:19.840]  covering what we're saying they'll focus in on some guy on the internet doing a
[2:46:19.840 --> 2:46:26.640]  hoax claiming that his digital TV converter has a microphone and camera in
[2:46:26.640 --> 2:46:30.000]  it and then discredit everything off of that Alex I'll tell you what's not a
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:34.600]  hoax I just got a word the other day that the Texas Transportation Commission
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:40.120]  is going to be sponsoring a seminar here in Austin in April to discuss how you
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:43.440]  track and trace everybody in their car and charge them by the mileage that they
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:47.920]  drive the fence of analysis going in force everyone to have some little
[2:46:47.920 --> 2:46:51.640]  gizmo in their car so they can just you can be a little bug on their screen the
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:54.240]  whole day long exactly where you went they're already using under the
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:58.640]  telecommunications act of 96 all cell phones even when they're off our GPS
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:02.040]  triangulated by the cell towers and they dial in with the audio the first time I
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:06.680]  saw it five years ago it's in matrix of evil the governor of Wisconsin blurted
[2:47:06.680 --> 2:47:09.720]  out it was in the newspaper that oh we're tracking you on with your cell
[2:47:09.720 --> 2:47:14.640]  phones at the emergency management center everywhere you go yeah so that's
[2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:17.040]  what I'm saying now they're going to be bringing it out in the open into a nice
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:21.600]  conference to discuss the feasibility of taxing you depending on where you go and
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:24.680]  how you drive and of course in order to do that you know you just have to be
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:30.160]  plugged into the matrix don't you yes so thank you caller let's talk to Glenn in
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:36.920]  Pennsylvania Glenn you're on the air yes Alex yes sir yes sir good
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:44.200]  good afternoon I just wanted to call on the first time caller and about 13 years
[2:47:44.200 --> 2:47:51.520]  ago my brother was in San Anton and about two years ago I injured myself and
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:57.160]  he told me he said start listening to this guy he knows what's going on so I
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:01.320]  started to pick up on you and I started the lesson I got so much to talk about
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:08.480]  but you've been listening for 13 years now that my brother has been my brother
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:18.000]  has been he was one of your first people down in down in the San Anton no okay I
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:22.960]  got so much to talk about but the main thing is that you had a caller on
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:28.720]  yesterday that sound like he didn't know what he was he'd been listening or
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:34.160]  anything and he wanted to find out when you wanted to what was the sign was
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:39.280]  going to be once yeah he was saying that I don't cover population control and
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:43.080]  reduction so this credibility went to one of them and then he said that all
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:47.240]  there's really kind of no hope and nobody's doing anything when the state of
[2:48:47.240 --> 2:48:52.280]  Texas is introducing tomorrow a bill to declare sovereignty against the feds
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:55.560]  that have been taken over by foreign banks I mean all we do is talk about
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:49:03.960]  solutions well I hope that the state of Texas is passes that and that wouldn't
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:10.480]  it be ironic if the alone-store state were to lead the the rest of us the thing
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:16.320]  is that once we start it's gonna have to everybody's gonna have to kick in and
[2:49:16.320 --> 2:49:23.600]  give them so much heartache and spread them so thin that we would be able to
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:26.480]  defeat them at that point in time that's right I hear you I appreciate the call
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:34.640]  drew in Oregon you're on the air go ahead if you want to be on there oh hey
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:43.520]  how's it going good go ahead well I was calling to talk about the I'm in Portland
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:48.960]  Oregon and currently I've been noticing that I went to go get on the the light
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:52.360]  rail that runs throughout the city here and I noticed that they replaced all the
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:58.200]  machines with credit-only machines yep not to mention that uh I use the
[2:49:58.200 --> 2:50:02.160]  transit quite a bit here in a lot recently I've noticed there there have
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:07.360]  been a lot of police and transit checkers walking around asking for people's
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:11.120]  IDs and yeah they're first they train you to go through checkpoints and be
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:14.880]  searched at airports that's dog training to be a slave line up show us your
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:18.640]  papers then it's the transit then it's the trains then it's the side of the
[2:50:18.640 --> 2:50:23.400]  street Homeland Security admits this and Southwest Airlines major train
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:27.640]  stations businesses are saying no cash now because they're getting ready in the
[2:50:27.640 --> 2:50:31.840]  next few years to abolish the dollar bring in a North American Union currency
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:36.560]  that is digital and that's why they now have the North American Union ID card
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:39.640]  stay there we'll talk more about it when we get back and I want to get Bob
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:42.960]  Dacey's take on that as well you want to ride shotgun a little bit with us with a
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:48.100]  microvaro coming up why not all right I can see microvaro he's waiting in the
[2:50:48.100 --> 2:50:51.680]  wings he'll be with us in about 10 minutes there he is on screen right

[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:33.760]  Boston in Chicago and LA and Portland everywhere the transit police aren't
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:36.800]  just gunning people down for no reason they're lining people up demanding their
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:41.000]  papers searching everyone this is part of our training to live in a total
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:44.520]  authoritarian police state they've now announced Homeland Security is for the
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:48.960]  American people 20,000 combat troops to occupy the United States and dissolve
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:52.760]  the states and they try to rebel to absorption into the New World Banking
[2:54:52.760 --> 2:55:00.120]  System as announced by Time Magazine go ahead well it's not just that Alex I
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:07.160]  mean I'm confounded as to why Oregon isn't on board with the sovereignty
[2:55:07.160 --> 2:55:11.040]  bill it's I mean we're a really liberal state and we got Washington and
[2:55:11.040 --> 2:55:14.520]  California on it I'm just can and I mean I've written to the Oregon
[2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:19.160]  representative and asked him about you know the sovereignty bill and and what
[2:55:19.160 --> 2:55:23.400]  he knew about the man and I got a reply saying what should I know about them and
[2:55:23.400 --> 2:55:28.880]  I'm just I'm wondering where it where the where the Oregon supporters are and
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:35.920]  I'm really not satisfied so far with the level of organization and well look
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:39.240]  you've got to make that happen I mean take last week I said why hasn't Texas
[2:55:39.240 --> 2:55:43.200]  introduced this we got a state rep on Friday who is introducing a sovereignty
[2:55:43.200 --> 2:55:47.680]  10th Amendment declaration that they know the feds have been globalized in our
[2:55:47.680 --> 2:55:50.920]  illegitimate and that the state's not going to go along with gun confiscation
[2:55:50.920 --> 2:55:54.040]  martial law or anything else I mean this is being introduced all over the
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:57.760]  country and it's thanks to people like you calling so you know and then and the
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:01.080]  rep asked what should I know send them some of the other bills from around the
[2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:04.680]  country point out what's happening the unfunded mandates and that's how you get
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:07.720]  them on board Bob Daisy I'm gonna tell you something you're talking about this
[2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:12.880]  sovereignty thing I think it's a fantastic idea you've got to have
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:16.800]  in order to stop this you got to have civil disobedience in all levels of
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:21.720]  society talking about individual people you talked about municipalities like
[2:56:21.720 --> 2:56:26.200]  when through your efforts the city of Austin passed a resolution against the
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:30.520]  Patriot Act several years ago that was that was spearheaded by Alex Jones and
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:35.040]  it at the at the state level yeah the same thing listen all they're doing is
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:40.640]  asserting the Constitution the 10th Amendment the states constituted the
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:44.840]  federal government becomes destructive they can dissolve it and reconstitute
[2:56:44.840 --> 2:56:48.760]  it instead the feds are illegitimately dissolving the state's real power and
[2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:53.240]  bringing us into globalism and listen not to my horn it's the audience we're
[2:56:53.240 --> 2:56:57.280]  talking about what did I do in 2001 after October passage the Patriot Act
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:01.120]  wrote an analysis of how it abolished six of the ten Bill of Rights how was
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:04.960]  illegitimate I said people need to get together and write resolutions for the
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:07.920]  states counties and cities to say we're gonna follow the Bell of Rights
[2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:13.880]  Constitution groups formed hundreds of cities over 800 past it and seven
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:18.960]  states again because you took the ball that's right and we got to continue to
[2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:23.400]  take the ball you know I said this before but I think it bears repeating
[2:57:23.400 --> 2:57:26.440]  when I was a kid I used to make fun of the hippies all the time I was just
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:29.160]  underneath the hippies when I was growing up I used to make fun of them
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:32.320]  but you know what the something they said during the Vietnam War which which
[2:57:32.320 --> 2:57:37.840]  rings true right now what they used to say is hey man what if they gave a war
[2:57:37.840 --> 2:57:44.800]  and nobody came you know well that that philosophy is cogent right now yeah we
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:48.160]  just say screw you we're not going along with your crap we don't buy anything
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:52.640]  you say yeah just forget it what if what if you you declare a totalitarian
[2:57:52.640 --> 2:57:57.600]  state and nobody shows up you know massive civil disobedience by the by
[2:57:57.600 --> 2:58:02.720]  the police state officials local officials just forget it man go find
[2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:06.160]  your own totalitarian state somewhere else and get the heck out of ours then
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:10.120]  the federal stage of bombing but we expose that exactly I mean you know what
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:13.600]  they do is they they care and stick you with all their nonsense I say here have

[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:09.920]  phone calls how do you think this Obama thing is gonna end I mean a bush was
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:13.280]  their puppet carried through their agenda became very unpopular he's a
[3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:17.320]  horrible little creature but at the same time just a puppet nonetheless you know
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:20.880]  puppet on the left puppet on the right gee I like this puppet as a famous
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:28.160]  comedian Bill Hicks like to say I do see a lot of the Obama people the old people
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:31.680]  that aren't complete sheep starting to wake up but some of them are just
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:38.560]  bleeding even more angrily Obama it was on the news yesterday that the Obama
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:42.160]  noids are running around pulling off conservative stickers knowing after
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:45.800]  people getting aggressive police are harassing people with anti-Obama stickers
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:48.760]  we know in Missouri police went on the news and said don't talk about Obama
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:53.360]  will decide if it's a liar not and arrest you that was on the news during the
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:57.000]  campaign I think it depends on how stupid people have been how stupid
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:01.840]  people are really I mean the two efforts your efforts and there's more and more
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:07.680]  people that aren't stupid and I think it depends on how many of them can still
[3:02:07.680 --> 3:02:11.520]  think and I think you just look at the Ron Paul campaign there's millions of
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:15.280]  young people that can still think and and they can keep spreading the word and I
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:18.840]  think that this thing is going to fail one way or the other Obama's going to be
[3:02:18.840 --> 3:02:23.640]  exposed as a fraud and I think it'll be I think it'll be quicker I think than
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:29.320]  George Bush just because that the lies are just coming just he's promised so
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:33.920]  much and he's going to deliver nothing and as the economy collapses that's what
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:37.920]  really makes people wake up is when they don't have anything to eat or that are
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:41.800]  there their paycheck gets cut or whatever they're going to be looking they're
[3:02:41.800 --> 3:02:44.760]  going to be looking for somebody to blame and since he's the guy sitting up
[3:02:44.760 --> 3:02:48.360]  there even though it's nothing but a puppet and since the economy continues
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:51.680]  to collapse and because they are collapsing economy on purpose he's
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:55.040]  going to take the heat but that's what the elite one exactly that the Obama
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:58.280]  supporters and the rest of the people fighting with each other Obama saying
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:00.840]  look you didn't get behind my plan that's why things are getting worse and
[3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:04.440]  everybody focuses on Obama instead of the power behind the throne you know I
[3:03:04.440 --> 3:03:07.880]  want to do something in here live on TV because this is crazy we got two
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:10.880]  different crews in here and a bunch of folks out there guys rotate this camera

[3:03:36.460 --> 3:03:41.280]  time to shoot video of the studio to give people an idea but also want to

[3:04:07.080 --> 3:04:13.160]  up Mike Rivera oh hey Mike how's it going Aloha there my friend Aloha newy

[3:04:18.720 --> 3:04:22.320]  come back I want you to talk about the alternative media and how it's exploding
[3:04:22.320 --> 3:04:26.120]  and displacing the mainstream corporate horror media and how they're striking
[3:04:26.120 --> 3:04:29.520]  back with internet to and now making the announcements that they're gonna have the
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:33.640]  FCC regulator speech on the web tell us what we can politically say Canada's
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:37.840]  announcing it and I want to get your take Bob and we will continue with your
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:44.440]  phone calls straight ahead with Mike Rivera oh Bob Daisy the Australian film
[3:04:44.440 --> 3:04:48.400]  crew and the independent film channel and the independent film channel is
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:51.800]  separately doing a little piece here but they got a film called the New World
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:55.800]  Order coming out with yours truly on my heels coming out in a few months on the
[3:04:55.800 --> 3:04:59.440]  IFC as well and it's the fairest documentary I've ever seen from the
[3:04:59.440 --> 3:05:04.080]  mainstream media so maybe they're good guys more than 700 chemicals have been
[3:05:04.080 --> 3:05:07.680]  found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to

[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:33.920]  the establishment is moving quickly the Toronto Star the New York Times have
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:36.920]  announced the last two days they are going to shut down the old web and have
[3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:41.920]  a gated safe community as the New York Times said taking your freedoms for
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:47.920]  your safety these are quotes the truth is these corporate whores are in trouble
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:50.920]  and they know it and I got news for them you could shut the web down today
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:55.920]  that will make people desperately seek out the truth that much faster and I
[3:09:55.920 --> 3:10:01.920]  know that the fastest way to make tyrants fall as microvaro says is to
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:04.920]  make a mac like dictators and that's certainly what's happening
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:08.920]  microvaro from Hawaii good to have you with us I would like you to break down
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:11.920]  the listeners your take on what's happening with this war between the
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:16.920]  exploding diverse alternative media and the dying dinosaur lie lie lie lie
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:20.920]  lies lies lies filled corporate whore press
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:24.920]  well I think you basically hit the nail right on the head the corporate media
[3:10:24.920 --> 3:10:28.920]  and their their government associates realize they're losing control over
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:32.920]  the minds of America and the minds of the world they're trying very hard to
[3:10:32.920 --> 3:10:37.920]  regain it I don't think they can succeed in fact I my own show I like to draw
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:42.920]  the parallel between the reaction of the power structure when Gutenberg
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:46.920]  invented movable type printing and all of a sudden inexpensive books were
[3:10:46.920 --> 3:10:50.920]  available to everybody and information was getting out beyond the control of
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:54.920]  the church and the government and those institutions that were able to adapt
[3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:59.920]  and evolve to that new reality survived the power structures that couldn't
[3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:03.920]  stand the information getting out and tried to stop it they're not with us
[3:11:03.920 --> 3:11:07.920]  anymore obviously there were book burnings there were translators of books
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:11.920]  were being burned a lot of people don't know this but the very first person to
[3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:15.920]  translate the Bible into English was burned at the stake as a heretic so there
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:20.920]  was this desperate attempt to continue the old order and the old degree of
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:25.920]  control but if you look at all of history it is an ongoing battle between the
[3:11:25.920 --> 3:11:30.920]  desire by the rulers to control what we see read here and think and every once
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:34.920]  in a while there's a technological revolution that changes the dynamics by
[3:11:34.920 --> 3:11:38.920]  which information flows to the society that's what we're seeing right now and
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:42.920]  ultimately the alternative media the internet the blogs we're going to
[3:11:42.920 --> 3:11:46.920]  reshape the future these panic moves by government and corporate media to try
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:50.920]  and reassert the old order they are ultimately doomed to failure
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:54.920]  I think it accelerates the rebellion and really makes it obvious for people
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:11:58.920]  when they come out and say I mean this is the senator over the committee and
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:02.920]  the FCC saying they're going to shut down freedom of speech on the web and
[3:12:02.920 --> 3:12:06.920]  they're trying to sell that to the public to keep us safe I mean this is
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:12.920]  ridiculous oh they're trying to categorize it in in terms of like child
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:15.920]  pornography or the threat of terrorists but you know it's it's amazing if you
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:21.920]  look at the fall of the Soviet Union and how hard they work to close down the
[3:12:21.920 --> 3:12:25.920]  Simon's dot which was a network of fax machines that was sharing the truth
[3:12:25.920 --> 3:12:29.920]  across the old Soviet Union and the harder the Soviets tried to shut that down
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:33.920]  the more people were plugging into it because people want the truth they're
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:37.920]  going to go where the truth is going to be found and that is why the audience has
[3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:41.920]  shifted over to the blogs in the alternative radio and why every day we
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:45.920]  hear newspapers are having to trim staff TV stations are letting people go
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:49.920]  they're losing their audience the audience is coming over here because as you
[3:12:49.920 --> 3:12:54.920]  said before Americans know the media has been lying to them nobody likes a liar
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:58.920]  we've been proven right time after time after time again the audience is coming
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:03.920]  over to us and if they try and impose a gated community people are going to find
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:07.920]  ways around the gates they already tried to do this in China it didn't work
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:10.920]  people found ways around the gates they went through proxies whatever means it
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:14.920]  takes they get through to where the truth can be found and the corporate
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:19.920]  control press has been trying to demonize Internet scare people and it's not
[3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:23.920]  working and they want to control their content they want to hoard whereas we
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:27.920]  with our content it's free we want people to have it we have a mission and
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:32.920]  so by its very nature they are handicapped and so they're now it's incredible
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:35.920]  I didn't think it would come this soon to have literally hundreds of
[3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:39.920]  newspapers announcing we need to shut the Internet down we need to only have a
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:43.920]  few thousand channels and the Toronto Star had their government board saying
[3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:48.920]  there's a lot of free entertainment news on the web now but we need to give them
[3:13:48.920 --> 3:13:52.920]  carefully crafted information for society and we need to shut it down and
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:57.920]  I mean this is pathetic and I heard Bill Press the fake liberal going we need to
[3:13:57.920 --> 3:14:02.920]  shut down talk radio and put me on more stations I mean make people listen to
[3:14:02.920 --> 3:14:07.920]  me I mean it's disgusting and they claim it's to shut down you know tools like
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:12.920]  Limbaugh that guy's discredited a million years ago it's not for that if you watch
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:16.920]  the Violent Radicalization Act hearings in Congress it is to shut people like Bob
[3:14:16.920 --> 3:14:22.920]  Dacey and Mike Rivera and Alex Jones and info wars dot com and the simple truth dot
[3:14:22.920 --> 3:14:25.920]  com and what really happened dot com down and you're right people now got a taste
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:29.920]  for truth and information and alternative information and and so it's not going to
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:34.920]  work Pandora's box is open the genies out of the bottle that that that that cow
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:38.920]  that you know that horse left the barn a long time ago you know these chickens
[3:14:38.920 --> 3:14:42.920]  flew the coup and use every other analogy you want Bob Dacey your take on this war
[3:14:42.920 --> 3:14:46.920]  between alternative media and the mainstream media no simple truth dot net
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:50.920]  by the way okay good truth dot net have made make that correction now listen I
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:54.920]  know one thing that the guys that are in the legislature you know the Congress
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:14:58.920]  but the senators they vote however they figure there's gonna line their pocket
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:01.920]  whenever they get away with it or whatever they feel is in their best selfish
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:04.920]  best interest when when the public is not looking they do whatever the heck they
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:08.920]  want but how much what percentage of the American people use the Internet every
[3:15:08.920 --> 3:15:13.920]  day it's humongous right but now you you those messing with their Internet they
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:17.920]  are gonna scream bloody murder and the politicians are gonna go oh they woke up
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:20.920]  and they're gonna have some problems they're gonna have some problems passing
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:23.920]  this garbage that's why they're incrementally coming in with ending that
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:27.920]  neutrality taxing the web regulating it controlling it but but I want to show
[3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:31.920]  people what we do here on air since we have a lot of media here especially from
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:38.920]  Australia I want you guys to Google in the control room right now communist
[3:15:38.920 --> 3:15:46.920]  Chinese style net censorship proposed for Australia I believe that's the exact
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:50.920]  headline it was all over the news there they just admitted it they they've been
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:53.920]  saying we're banning all protest and if you do protest will arrest you as a
[3:15:53.920 --> 3:15:56.920]  terrorist people still come out and protest and they say yes we are going
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:01.920]  to shut the web down to only a few this is in the news there a few thousand sites
[3:16:01.920 --> 3:16:05.920]  that we say are safe and they and they use the excuse of there's people teaching
[3:16:05.920 --> 3:16:08.920]  folks how to commit suicide on the web and there's there's pornography there's
[3:16:08.920 --> 3:16:12.920]  that but then they admit it's political sites and hate sites anybody that
[3:16:12.920 --> 3:16:17.920]  covers this and see that's the thing we do we we cover and track and analyze and
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:23.920]  and and critique a lot of mainstream media but before it's always global media
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:28.920]  the nightly news the same stories on ABC CBS NBC Fox in the same order with the
[3:16:28.920 --> 3:16:34.920]  same Prozac and and and you know ads on there I mean not just the same
[3:16:34.920 --> 3:16:37.920]  programming in the same order the same ads on there you got a viagra ad you
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:42.920]  got a prozac ad you get some you know probably sick exactly you've got all
[3:16:42.920 --> 3:16:47.920]  these ads on there it's the same thing but what we do is we'll take a local
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:52.920]  news story that wasn't mainstream news and make it international we will take
[3:16:52.920 --> 3:16:56.920]  a foreign news story to where Australia goes yeah we're doing when England and
[3:16:56.920 --> 3:17:00.920]  the US are doing we're going to shut the web down to a few thousand sites it's
[3:17:00.920 --> 3:17:03.920]  Chinese communist style internet censorship but it's for your own good and
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:07.920]  we'll go see they admit what they're doing in Australia so because we have a
[3:17:07.920 --> 3:17:12.920]  Australian film crew did you find it because I want to punch it up on screen
[3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:16.920]  for people here it is Australian implement mandatory internet censorship
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:23.920]  that's the herald sun upon screen right now for everybody but but that's not
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:27.920]  the exact one I want there's another one that says Chinese style it may say
[3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:31.920]  Chinese and a communist Chinese Chinese style net censorship for Australia
[3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:36.920]  Chinese style net censorship for Australia or Australia to have Chinese
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:40.920]  style net censorship I believe that's the one of those is the exact headline
[3:17:40.920 --> 3:17:44.920]  and you can pull that up see and and before I would just say that on radio
[3:17:44.920 --> 3:17:47.920]  and link to the story on info wars dot com for folks to go see it and people
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:51.920]  would you know on YouTube post my videos that's just made up he just made
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:55.920]  that up now because we're simulcasting video I can throw the sucker on screen
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:18:00.920]  I can do a Google search I can say thousands of government university studies
[3:18:00.920 --> 3:18:03.920]  show that watching more than an hour of TV a day causes massive brain damage
[3:18:03.920 --> 3:18:06.920]  because the brain goes into a sleep state and no longer connects new neural
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:12.920]  pathways and then they can Google that in tens of thousands of the of the
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:17.920]  articles and studies pop up and I can click on them and show people see so
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:21.920]  the mainstream media a lot of the stuff's actually there it's just people
[3:18:21.920 --> 3:18:24.920]  we aggregated and bring it all together look at that Australia to follow
[3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:30.920]  Chinese China net censorship and what publication is that out of that's
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:35.920]  out of the something today I can't read it from this distance on the URL
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:39.920]  what's the URL I want to know what newspaper that is I know it was all
[3:18:39.920 --> 3:18:45.920]  over their major newspapers all right and that's a blog reporting on the
[3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:52.920]  mainstream news story your comments on this micro vero well it's it's a panic
[3:18:52.920 --> 3:18:55.920]  reaction and we've actually been seeing this for a very very long time I
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:18:59.920]  remember back when I was first starting what really happened dot com we had
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:05.920]  the infamous Exxon amendment and that was actually preceded by the
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:10.920]  discouragement of large amounts of really ugly pornography all over the
[3:19:10.920 --> 3:19:14.920]  internet back then most communication between people was done through
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:19.920]  something called you use net which was used news groups and some were
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:22.920]  moderated and some were not and the unmoderated ones were basically where
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:26.920]  you went for anything that you know that your taste went to but somebody

[3:24:00.920 --> 3:24:29.920]  now Bob Dacey loves micro vero and you know just like dr. Col Craig roberts was saying people basically had to vote for Obama because we had repudiate Bush's torture secret arrest our image in the world I knew it was going to be a bait and switch because of his advisors and what he done in the past but you know Mike said that if he didn't do what he said he was going to go after him and he has been going after him
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:34.560]  and i was joking when i said it was a mean question bob daisy address your question
[3:24:34.560 --> 3:24:40.680]  from austin texas to honolulu okay mike how you doing i'm doing just fine that's great
[3:24:40.680 --> 3:24:45.680]  this is not a mean question this is just a good intellectual journalistic question okay
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:49.960]  i go to what really happened dot com every single day to see what really happened in
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:55.520]  the world also go to info wars dot com every single day those are my two super reliable
[3:24:55.520 --> 3:25:02.000]  internet sources are keyboard wars with what he was made up so i'll get the site now whatever
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:06.640]  anyway those those that's where i go to to know what's going on and uh... but i have
[3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:12.640]  a question for you because i was puzzled about uh... your editorial comment during
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:19.440]  the election that you seem to want to give barack obama the the benefit of the doubt
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:23.640]  all the time and and and a lot while i watch that i said you know
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:28.040]  referral knows what's going on why is he doing that and i was just wondering
[3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:29.240]  what do you
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:33.080]  your comment about that is so why you were giving barack obama the benefit of the
[3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:36.200]  doubt during the election campaign
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:40.600]  well unfortunately uh... i was one of the people who wanted ron paul to be very honest
[3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:42.520]  uh... to be in the office and when
[3:25:42.520 --> 3:25:46.000]  yeah and when it came down to a choice between mccain obama
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:50.360]  uh... my preference went to obama but it was a marginal preference at best and the
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:54.120]  only reason i gave obama the benefit of the doubt
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:58.680]  was because when he first started his campaign he was saying a lot of the things
[3:25:58.680 --> 3:26:01.560]  that made more sense certainly than john mccain did
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:05.400]  uh... then as he moved centers i began to have some real serious doubts
[3:26:05.400 --> 3:26:09.760]  what i was thinking might be the case and the reason why i said i'm i'm i'm gonna
[3:26:09.760 --> 3:26:11.200]  look at obama
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:15.560]  uh... uh... as marginally preferable to john mccain
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:19.240]  is that he might turn out to be another jack kennedy now as you know john kennedy
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:20.520]  got into office
[3:26:20.520 --> 3:26:24.280]  and he basically said okay i've got the job i'm going to do it the way i think
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:25.400]  it should be done
[3:26:25.400 --> 3:26:29.320]  and not as i'm being to told to do it by all the people who supported me
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:33.080]  and i was thinking obama might be of that ill but sadly that has not come to
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:35.400]  pass and i've probably is disappointed in him
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:38.040]  as just about anybody else and as alex jones pointed out
[3:26:38.040 --> 3:26:40.360]  yeah i'm going after barack obama now
[3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:43.560]  he's surrounded himself with a bunch of clinton appointees
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:47.320]  uh... he is doing i think everything wrong regarding the economy i'm even
[3:26:47.320 --> 3:26:51.160]  beginning to think that alex jones may be correct in that this is a deliberate
[3:26:51.160 --> 3:26:52.200]  takedown
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:55.880]  because i can't imagine there is that much stupidity in the obama
[3:26:55.880 --> 3:26:56.840]  administration
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:26:59.400]  it has to be by design
[3:26:59.400 --> 3:27:02.680]  yeah i mean he was saying he was in the war day one that was six months eighteen
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:04.200]  months and twenty three months
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:07.320]  and you know uh... that's why a lot of people to support him but you know i mean
[3:27:07.320 --> 3:27:10.280]  here's mike saying he got suckered i mean
[3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:13.400]  yeah well you know uh... we were the last answer though that's a good that's an
[3:27:13.400 --> 3:27:15.000]  honest answer you know
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:18.840]  that that i would i wanted to find out i want to say also moonlight is an
[3:27:18.840 --> 3:27:19.640]  inquisitor
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:23.480]  well i hate you know that look like alice you know darn well that the mainstream
[3:27:23.480 --> 3:27:24.520]  media will not
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:26.680]  ask any tough question of anybody
[3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:29.720]  you know they they literally kiss the hind end of these people
[3:27:29.720 --> 3:27:32.840]  you know like like few years ago up in georgetown when
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:36.040]  when you were when your crew was up there in georgetown talking to thomas
[3:27:36.040 --> 3:27:38.600]  keen and i was up there for my tv show talking to
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:40.840]  thomas keen the chairman of the nine one commission
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:44.760]  i mean the mainstream media was in the room and they were kissing his hind end
[3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:48.440]  oh please oh please sir tell us how to save ourselves from the terrorist lord
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:51.960]  keen yeah and so who clobbered him with the real questions i did and your
[3:27:51.960 --> 3:27:53.000]  people did
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:55.960]  you know work with the real media not them
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:27:59.720]  what about lord keen and lord keen mr cfr member
[3:27:59.720 --> 3:28:00.680]  yeah
[3:28:00.680 --> 3:28:03.080]  that's actually in loose change final cut
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:04.360]  good information
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:05.880]  um...
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:09.320]  it how fast will the honeymoon where off do you think micro vero with lord
[3:28:09.320 --> 3:28:10.120]  obama
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:13.720]  because i'm seeing some of the obamanoids wake up
[3:28:13.720 --> 3:28:17.960]  uh... it's gone already i think his numbers are already in decline i think
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:21.640]  the fact that he's doing everything wrong regarding the economy
[3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:25.880]  uh... i mean the stock market so heading down again today in response to his
[3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:26.760]  latest
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:30.360]  uh... plan to try and fix the mortgages people realizing
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:33.800]  it's not going to work it's politically
[3:28:33.800 --> 3:28:37.880]  crafted it is not practical it is not economic i think the problem that a lot
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:40.920]  of people are realizing is we have a government in a corporate culture
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:43.960]  that consists almost entirely of lawyers and accountants
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:47.320]  so they're trying to solve america's problems with creative bookkeeping
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:52.200]  and juggling the rules and they don't really know how to get our economy back
[3:28:52.200 --> 3:28:53.160]  on track
[3:28:53.160 --> 3:28:56.520]  and i really do think that we're in this the phase of our history where the
[3:28:56.520 --> 3:28:59.240]  government is looting the nation putting it in their own pocket
[3:28:59.240 --> 3:29:02.440]  and they're just going to let it collapse well i agree with you more than
[3:29:02.440 --> 3:29:05.160]  that bring us now into a new world government super bank i want to talk
[3:29:05.160 --> 3:29:06.440]  to you about that we get back but
[3:29:06.440 --> 3:29:09.160]  this nation had a bad case of the bush oids
[3:29:09.160 --> 3:29:11.560]  now we got a really bad case of the obama noids
[3:29:11.560 --> 3:29:14.680]  and i think you know in preparation age will fix it
[3:29:14.680 --> 3:29:18.200]  so i think now people are finally on and this is uncomfortable
[3:29:18.200 --> 3:29:22.440]  i mean this obama no it is is bad it's it's it's it's big
[3:29:22.440 --> 3:29:24.200]  it's a serious problem
[3:29:24.200 --> 3:29:27.240]  here uh... so i will come back and talk more about how we get rid
[3:29:27.240 --> 3:29:31.160]  of the obama no it problem and all the people want to keep being supporters of
[3:29:31.160 --> 3:29:33.440]  obama no it
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:34.360]  sounds painful
[3:29:34.360 --> 3:29:37.480]  do you like that analogy or it's a good analogy
[3:29:37.480 --> 3:29:41.480]  it's ridiculous juvenile disgusting humor
[3:29:41.480 --> 3:29:46.280]  from the mind of alex jones and bob but it works
[3:29:46.280 --> 3:29:49.240]  micro vero is our guest so is bob daisy

[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:25.160]  now mike revero australian film crew from national tv
[3:33:25.160 --> 3:33:29.160]  and we have the independent film channel making a separate profile on me
[3:33:29.160 --> 3:33:31.800]  uh and then the independent film channel a couple months is coming out with a
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:35.000]  film called the new world order the main selection at south by southwest
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:39.640]  uh this year and i may not tell you kind of get scary bob the amount of people
[3:33:39.640 --> 3:33:42.440]  are starting to reach because i mean it's just like exponential
[3:33:42.440 --> 3:33:46.200]  yeah but you know the deal is alex the truth sells and you're peddling the
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:48.680]  truth man and that's just the bottom line
[3:33:48.680 --> 3:33:52.120]  yeah i just feel sorry for all the other quote patriot groups and people that
[3:33:52.120 --> 3:33:55.640]  got jealous early on of our success because my goal was to bring a
[3:33:55.640 --> 3:33:59.160]  platform for everybody to be on there's hundreds of people i don't have on
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:01.720]  because they're vicious liars and demons and i watched them
[3:34:01.720 --> 3:34:05.800]  destroy themselves because of that and it's just so sad and their desperate
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:08.760]  attempt to stop me and i don't think most of them are even government agents i
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:10.920]  just i just it's just such a sick society bob
[3:34:10.920 --> 3:34:14.280]  well you know you have natural jealousies in any
[3:34:14.280 --> 3:34:18.120]  uh endeavor but the fact of the matter is you know i've known you for what
[3:34:18.120 --> 3:34:22.680]  11 years now and uh you know alex jones tells the truth
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:26.440]  you he may he may make it all exciting or something like that and he gets all
[3:34:26.440 --> 3:34:30.360]  excited it is exciting that bankers hijacked it and then major newspapers
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:34.440]  are announcing a giant bank of the world will rule everything and i'm
[3:34:34.440 --> 3:34:38.040]  going to pay carbon taxes to him that is exciting we need to get excited
[3:34:38.040 --> 3:34:42.040]  exactly but a lot of people use that against you so he's getting he's
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:44.920]  he's he's flying off the handle or something like that but it's true
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:48.200]  how could you not be excited about it when that's all you do is study it
[3:34:48.200 --> 3:34:51.000]  they've introduced bills to ban all semi-automatics
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:54.440]  they've introduced bills to psychologically register all gun owners
[3:34:54.440 --> 3:34:57.960]  they've introduced bills to mark all the ammo and track it make you get a
[3:34:57.960 --> 3:35:01.160]  million dollars in sure i mean psychologically register all gun owners
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:04.360]  they've introduced a bill that would make you a criminal if you didn't register
[3:35:04.360 --> 3:35:06.840]  your old 38 that's been in your house for 15 years
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:10.440]  you could be an automatic i know i know exactly that listen i get on air and
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:13.960]  describe these gun bills and people email me saying you're not saying as bad as
[3:35:13.960 --> 3:35:16.840]  it is i mean did folks it's happening i mean
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:20.760]  they're making the move right now yeah yeah and you know they tyrants they were
[3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:23.800]  just as they were just asking me how i have so much energy
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:27.400]  how would i not have this much energy i mean this is insane you didn't take
[3:35:27.400 --> 3:35:30.760]  enough um prozac and and rilliam when you were a
[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:34.120]  kid man or something maybe you drank didn't drink enough

[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:40.920]  uh we just had an i sdn cut out but we're back on air with our
[3:35:40.920 --> 3:35:45.080]  quadrupled backups to the satellite uplinks in houston
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:48.280]  we're here at camcran avril houston is minnesota
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:52.920]  this is launch site camcran avril but we do have a great responsibility as well
[3:35:52.920 --> 3:35:58.040]  like they say in the spider-man movie uh let's go ahead and go back to
[3:35:58.040 --> 3:36:01.720]  micro vero mike there's a lot going on how do you see them we you know we
[3:36:01.720 --> 3:36:03.080]  talked about how they're going to fail but
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:06.520]  they are coming at us with internet to admitting that it is to censor the web
[3:36:06.520 --> 3:36:10.200]  i mean we need to fight this and get the word out uh you know a lot of they've
[3:36:10.200 --> 3:36:13.160]  got hate laws introduced to basically restrict all sorts of speech in the
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:16.680]  u.s. they're talking about making it a crime to deny climate
[3:36:16.680 --> 3:36:20.440]  climate denial uh associating that with denying the holocaust i mean it's getting
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:23.320]  bad yeah it really is getting bad they're
[3:36:23.320 --> 3:36:27.320]  talking about climate denial they're talking about 9-11 denial
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:31.960]  and all they're really doing is advertising the fact that they're scared
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:35.640]  that they can't win the arguments on the basis of facts logic and science and
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:39.480]  so they're just going to bludgeon people into believing as they're told
[3:36:39.480 --> 3:36:43.880]  and uh... i'm rather honored that you quoted me earlier on the fastest way to
[3:36:43.880 --> 3:36:47.320]  bring down a dictators to get them to act like one where everybody can see it
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:36:50.440]  and that is what's going on right now and you're talking about the audience
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:54.760]  flooding over to prison planet and info wars and your radio show and my radio
[3:36:54.760 --> 3:36:58.360]  show and so forth and so on i gotta tell you and maybe this is because so many
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:01.560]  people are losing their jobs the email to my
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:06.440]  show has doubled just in the last three weeks to my website it's just going
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:09.320]  through the roof the audience numbers are going up for me i'm sure they're
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:13.320]  doing exactly the same for you uh... we're picking up more and more affiliates
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:17.000]  people want to know what's going on they know the government is lying and the
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:21.160]  more the government is pushing trying to get people back into that little box
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:24.200]  they're supposed to be living in the more people are fighting back and i'm
[3:37:24.200 --> 3:37:26.600]  seeing so much anger expressed out there
[3:37:26.600 --> 3:37:30.680]  as to what's going on and you know it's like a magician and a trick as long as
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:33.880]  you don't know the trick is going on you'll admire the pretty lights and say
[3:37:33.880 --> 3:37:37.160]  who it's there but once you know something's happened you can't make
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:40.760]  yourself forget once you know that there really isn't an easter bunny
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:44.040]  you can't be forced to going back to saying yes there is one
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:47.480]  and so all these beliefs are falling apart
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:51.080]  i want to get final comments from you mike revero but bob daisies gotta go he's
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:54.200]  gonna go back and run his little uh... hardware store one of the last
[3:37:54.200 --> 3:37:57.400]  independent standalone hardware stores in austin
[3:37:57.400 --> 3:38:00.920]  hey and you know i'm trying to wait for my bailout actually alex i go to the
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:02.120]  mailbox every day

[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:05.960]  compensation
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:09.880]  minimum check from the government and then i'll shut up you know i mean really
[3:38:09.880 --> 3:38:12.120]  because i i i deserve five hundred thousand
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:15.720]  and you know from those according to their abilities to those according to
[3:38:15.720 --> 3:38:16.680]  their needs
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:17.640]  so you know
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:19.720]  why don't i just go into this thing and wait for my
[3:38:19.720 --> 3:38:22.840]  wait for my executive compensation i promise i won't take any more than five
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:24.760]  hundred thousand dollar max i promise
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:28.280]  tell folks we're a little hardware store is uh... in austin that don't want to go
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:31.560]  to the big box stores well you know we're the local true value franchise
[3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:34.840]  here in austin and we're at spice with spring's road 183 in northwest austin
[3:38:34.840 --> 3:38:39.160]  and we have a hardware store and we make screens and we sell alex jones
[3:38:39.160 --> 3:38:42.680]  video and do a little bit of locksmithing and do
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:45.240]  all kinds of you know we even sell guns we even
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:49.000]  uh... go to the rabble slave with a weapon
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:53.240]  disarm him get the gods disarm him immediately
[3:38:53.240 --> 3:38:58.680]  but one of the slaves have a weapon raise the alarm raise it oh good lord
[3:38:58.680 --> 3:39:02.040]  the problem with the selling of guns right now alex is this they're awful
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:05.720]  hard to get right now but the rabble you can't have the slaves
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:12.680]  because barack the quack has made everyone want to buy guns he's been
[3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:17.240]  real really good for the gun industry lord obama is a sensible individual
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:20.600]  total disarmament of the civilian population
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:25.880]  under the unity in 2001 july 7th agreement to disarm all civilians
[3:39:25.880 --> 3:39:31.080]  for a power monopoly of the state under u n law is the only sensible system
[3:39:31.080 --> 3:39:34.680]  if we're going to carry out eugenics against these slaves
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:38.840]  and their rabble scar they need to be authorized immediately
[3:39:38.840 --> 3:39:42.680]  and how dare they're not want to be slaves how dare they're not want to be
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:46.600]  in inner city reservations how dare they're not submit to us
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:52.200]  and i'll divide where we're geniuses and what alex just said is actually factual
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:55.640]  it was christoph carlin patricia lewis unidire
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:39:59.800]  2000 in a paper they put out called disarming
[3:39:59.800 --> 3:40:03.160]  taking this military-style weapons away from civilians
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:07.320]  everything he just joked about right now is actually documented
[3:40:07.320 --> 3:40:12.040]  in fact of course we must take all your firearms including the semi-automatic
[3:40:12.040 --> 3:40:16.280]  how are we going to reeducate you to accept being euthanized
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:21.640]  if we don't do it according to according to obama and his people the
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:25.000]  right of the people to keep him bareflint locks shall not be in
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:27.880]  frame and the founding fathers as you've seen our
[3:40:27.880 --> 3:40:32.200]  fema training videos to police in kansas city were terrorist
[3:40:32.200 --> 3:40:36.520]  against the crowd the second amendment is a vicious crime
[3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:40.920]  absolutely how do you know how do you want to
[3:40:40.920 --> 3:40:46.520]  disarm you immediately that man that man they're laughing sees him sees him
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:51.240]  here's he has been ruled to a lordship
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:54.360]  uh... mike would you like to do any less imitation
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:40:57.560]  and now but i did have a comment here there's one positive thing about a
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:01.080]  flintlock and that is you learn how to place your shots and you don't waste in
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:04.600]  the ammo and uh... don't diss the muzzle loaders
[3:41:04.600 --> 3:41:07.480]  because we don't have paperwork following our guns around
[3:41:07.480 --> 3:41:11.880]  and once you learn how to place that shot those those old rifles can be very
[3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:15.400]  very accurate at a distance by the bills that are well that's why i was
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:17.480]  trained on a single shot twenty two
[3:41:17.480 --> 3:41:20.840]  if you load each time and i mean literally i could shoot a bullseye at
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:24.440]  two hundred yards without a little kid we know supreme court back in thirty nine
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:28.040]  said that uh... if these the weapons that were really protected by the second
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:31.160]  amendment were the type in common use at the time by the military
[3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:34.200]  and it just so happens that during the time of the revolution that the
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:38.280]  civilians the militiamen had better rifles than the regular army they had
[3:41:38.280 --> 3:41:41.240]  rifles in the regular and the long rifles smoothbore muskets
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:43.640]  you know the bravest is going to the broad side of the world
[3:41:43.640 --> 3:41:47.320]  now you'll speak badly of the gracious imperial forces
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:51.400]  of king robert third as he put down that disgusting
[3:41:51.400 --> 3:41:55.320]  that disgusting rebellion by these operative slaves pardon me i'm just
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:41:58.280]  trying to do a little historical context here alex that's all
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:02.120]  that the the militiamen had better rifles than the regular army
[3:42:02.120 --> 3:42:07.480]  so they were disgusting wild savage heathens
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:12.600]  and we went forward to confiscate their firearms and they dare fire back at us
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:16.120]  yes as what's that the movie said was it in the uh... in the patriot these are
[3:42:16.120 --> 3:42:20.520]  rustics are so inept yes
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:25.640]  yeah the rustics won yes the rustics won definitely because they weren't part of
[3:42:25.640 --> 3:42:28.680]  the right and now we put fluoride in their water
[3:42:28.680 --> 3:42:32.200]  that teaches them i'm sorry mr revero
[3:42:32.200 --> 3:42:36.760]  go ahead uh... well you listen you don't have to worry about fluoride in the
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:39.320]  water if you're drinking beer all the time
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:42.920]  absolutely not listen bob daisy great happening here thank you very much
[3:42:42.920 --> 3:42:46.040]  alex mike good seeing you man i'm glad to talk to you
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:49.400]  now we're going to talk to you too i'll continue to go to what really happened
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:52.760]  dot com every day right after i go to info wars dot com
[3:42:52.760 --> 3:42:56.280]  i'll take care good to see you my friend thank you thank you very much
[3:42:56.280 --> 3:43:01.080]  guys get ready with the youtube video of the supposed camera and microphone
[3:43:01.080 --> 3:43:04.840]  in the magnavox digital tv converter because
[3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:07.320]  we're gonna we're gonna go over that here in a moment
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:10.760]  by kandiyos pop all right i've been ranting and raving here for the
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:15.320]  cameras uh... final comments micro vero
[3:43:15.320 --> 3:43:18.600]  they're really beating the drums now about iran having secret weapons and
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:21.560]  devil drones looks like they're really trying to build that back up
[3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:25.240]  israel admitted a few days ago they're launching terror attacks inside iran to
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:27.960]  try to get them to do something where do you see that going
[3:43:27.960 --> 3:43:31.240]  well obviously you know the u.s. government knows they're in serious
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:34.200]  serious trouble and i think they're trying to go back to the conventional
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:38.280]  wisdom that if they can get a good regional or global war going
[3:43:38.280 --> 3:43:41.720]  that we the american people will forget all about the lies and the the
[3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:45.400]  cheating and the economic hardships and we'll just line up behind the flag and
[3:43:45.400 --> 3:43:49.480]  salute smartly and throw our children into the flames of a foreign war yet
[3:43:49.480 --> 3:43:51.480]  again i don't think it's going to work
[3:43:51.480 --> 3:43:55.400]  because again the dynamics by which information flows to our society has
[3:43:55.400 --> 3:43:58.760]  completely changed but i think the people running our government are a bunch
[3:43:58.760 --> 3:44:03.800]  of old cold war fossils who don't get it they don't understand
[3:44:03.800 --> 3:44:07.400]  how the information's environment has completely changed
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:11.640]  because of the internet because of your website because of our radio shows
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:15.400]  well that very that sounds very american alcatash talking about the founding
[3:44:15.400 --> 3:44:18.520]  fathers and things micro vero will talk to you again soon with your months of
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:21.240]  month visit i know that's coming up just a week or so
[3:44:21.240 --> 3:44:25.000]  and godspeed my friend take care thank you very much
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:28.840]  you bet there he goes ladies and gentlemen bye-bye to hawaii let's just
[3:44:28.840 --> 3:44:32.360]  say bye to him one more time here and then you know that's what's so
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:36.120]  strong about the alternative media is that it's just a webcam it's a little
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:38.600]  studio it's some cameras it's some lights we're here covering the news we're
[3:44:38.600 --> 3:44:39.720]  having fun with it
[3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:43.400]  we're i mean we're we're just showing the insanity that's being put in the news
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:46.440]  like it's no big deal like bush announced it
[3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:49.160]  for five years previous they were staging terror attacks
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:53.960]  in iran using al-qaeda using wahhabiist out of saudi arabia
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:57.000]  and then now israel admits they're staging terror attacks in iran and they
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:00.280]  just report it like it's a good thing oh we're assassinating and bombing
[3:45:00.280 --> 3:45:03.880]  and killing people in iran and they're laying down and taking it aren't they
[3:45:03.880 --> 3:45:06.840]  bad so i just take the mainstream london telegraph
[3:45:06.840 --> 3:45:09.720]  and go this is insane i take haratz and go they're
[3:45:09.720 --> 3:45:13.320]  reporting this like it's a good thing is that a good thing
[3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:18.120]  what would you do if iran had troops here staging terror attacks
[3:45:18.120 --> 3:45:20.840]  i mean i mean think about this okay i want to go ahead and play
[3:45:20.840 --> 3:45:25.320]  this video do you have the youtube ready i want to play this off youtube because
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:29.240]  i got a lot of emails we wrote a blurb about it saying is it up
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:33.160]  is it a hoax it appears to be a hoax now remember
[3:45:33.160 --> 3:45:36.520]  this discredits all the serious research where google and others admit
[3:45:36.520 --> 3:45:39.880]  they're using the microphone the camera to dial in listen to what you're doing
[3:45:39.880 --> 3:45:43.880]  and then taylor advertising for your tivo and other cable systems being two
[3:45:43.880 --> 3:45:47.000]  way bring one of the cable boxes i want to show folks that in a minute
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:50.680]  right now let's go ahead and play part of this clip here it is
[3:45:50.680 --> 3:45:55.560]  so i bought one of these digital converter tv boxes
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:46:00.040]  i actually bought two of them and i had a friend that
[3:46:00.040 --> 3:46:04.840]  was trying to tell me that they put cameras in these things that
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:09.240]  you know that you sit on your tv and and uh
[3:46:09.240 --> 3:46:14.040]  you know somebody the government or whoever has the ability to spy on you
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:18.360]  and so what i did is i opened it up to prove them wrong
[3:46:18.360 --> 3:46:22.280]  and uh lo and behold
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:27.480]  this is a magnivox unit by the way that was purchased at walmart
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:34.760]  lo and behold though as you can see right here
[3:46:34.760 --> 3:46:43.560]  is a camera unit there's actually uh a uh if i can focus here a microphone
[3:46:43.560 --> 3:46:48.520]  here's the rs sensor so not to confuse the camera for
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:52.120]  you know what you would use as a remote control
[3:46:52.120 --> 3:46:56.360]  but clearly you can see all right that's enough this thing doesn't
[3:46:56.360 --> 3:47:00.040]  have a lot of time left here so we went out and bought the very same box
[3:47:00.040 --> 3:47:04.040]  very same unit so there's the only unit slave mart was selling walmart was
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:08.440]  selling it is the very same
[3:47:08.440 --> 3:47:11.640]  magnivox and you've got the little hole in there
[3:47:11.640 --> 3:47:15.240]  uh behind the black so that the infrared
[3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:19.480]  channel controller will work this is a converter for
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:24.360]  the digital to analog they said the conversion this week
[3:47:24.360 --> 3:47:28.680]  and we have engineers that work here i mean the great engineers and one of
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:32.360]  them looked at this and this is the same circuitry
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:35.240]  as you have in the video so there would be extra circuitry here for a
[3:47:35.240 --> 3:47:40.440]  microphone for a camera and also this is not two
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:43.800]  way this system you know isn't isn't hooked up to cable
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:48.040]  so they would have a way of getting it out and so it appears it is a complete
[3:47:48.040 --> 3:47:50.360]  hoax you know you could say oh well maybe just his
[3:47:50.360 --> 3:47:53.960]  unit had it and yours didn't well we and we bought this and it didn't
[3:47:53.960 --> 3:47:57.480]  but then when you notice that there's not the circuitry you would need for it
[3:47:57.480 --> 3:48:02.600]  you know that you've got an issue here uh because we can look at this
[3:48:02.600 --> 3:48:06.120]  circuitry and look at the circuitry in his video and see it's the exact same
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:10.360]  circuitry and there's not the extra circuitry to have a camera
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:14.440]  and i don't know why this guy did that i don't know why
[3:48:14.440 --> 3:48:17.960]  but over and over again i see you know we're not just here exposing the
[3:48:17.960 --> 3:48:21.240]  mainstream media we're covering the alternative
[3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:24.280]  media we're not policing it we're just gonna hundreds of calls and emails we
[3:48:24.280 --> 3:48:27.000]  go and check it ourselves and so i'd say 98
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:31.400]  percent chance this is a hoax now what does that end up doing
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:36.920]  well it ends up discrediting things like this
[3:48:36.920 --> 3:48:41.320]  that's what it does it is credits serious research
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:44.680]  in a big way because zoom in over here for me
[3:48:44.680 --> 3:48:47.960]  if you look at this this little cheap
[3:48:47.960 --> 3:48:52.120]  three hundred fifty dollar acer laptop zoom in for me right here guys
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:48:57.000]  you can see that there is a camera right there
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:01.800]  right here and there is also a microphone and google admits in fact we had
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:03.800]  time we pulled this up i should have thought of that
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:08.840]  uh google google using microphones and cameras to record
[3:49:08.840 --> 3:49:13.400]  users and you'll find a prism planet dot com article then it links to a google
[3:49:13.400 --> 3:49:17.080]  press release and their scientific research and then they bragged it
[3:49:17.080 --> 3:49:20.360]  yahoo's doing it too but their system is better remember the super bowl the
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:24.040]  janet jackson malfunction with tivo remember that
[3:49:24.040 --> 3:49:28.440]  and then tivo said the chicago tribunal we had 2.2 million rewinds and replays
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:32.040]  so it was 2. something it was it was 2 and a million it was 2 million something
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:34.840]  i think it was 2.2 million and they said well how do you know that well the cable
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:38.440]  system is two ways and the tivo system many of them
[3:49:38.440 --> 3:49:40.760]  have microphones and cameras in them it's come out
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:43.640]  but that's not what's important they're recording what you watch they know what
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:47.000]  you're doing they understand your true psychological makeup
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:50.520]  and your true algorithm they think with a 600 question test they can do that
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:53.640]  imagine with the hundreds of thousands of choices you make every year and as the
[3:49:53.640 --> 3:49:55.880]  tv's and cable systems become your internet
[3:49:55.880 --> 3:49:59.240]  and your xbox and all this it's much worse so you have this hidden in plain
[3:49:59.240 --> 3:50:03.880]  view right in front of everyone and then meanwhile
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:07.000]  people are out seeing the digital converters are doing it when they're not
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:10.120]  and so people go check this they find out it's not true
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:13.160]  and then they tell me oh it's been disproving that there's a camera on this
[3:50:13.160 --> 3:50:16.840]  or that google or yahoo or others bragged that they
[3:50:16.840 --> 3:50:20.040]  have ai computers and google says don't worry we're just
[3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:24.280]  having a computer create a text of the words and audio in your home and if your
[3:50:24.280 --> 3:50:28.280]  dog barks we put up a dog food ad pops up because your dog's barking and the
[3:50:28.280 --> 3:50:31.160]  google computer back at a network goes oh there's a dog
[3:50:31.160 --> 3:50:34.520]  put a dog food ad or they say they listen to what you listen to on tv
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:37.240]  and then an ad for the tv show you're listening to because they have databases
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:40.680]  of it pops up so there you have it ladies and gentlemen
[3:50:40.680 --> 3:50:44.520]  the real big brother surveillance system cameras going up at school bathrooms
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:48.360]  face scanning cameras going up on the highways and roads that's all real
[3:50:48.360 --> 3:50:53.160]  this a crock of bull that only discredits the important work we're doing
[3:50:53.160 --> 3:50:55.320]  so just because you can't trust the mainstream media doesn't mean you can
[3:50:55.320 --> 3:50:58.680]  trust alternative media check everything for yourself
[3:50:58.680 --> 3:51:04.760]  that is what we do here right now the world is a scary place it's only a
[3:51:04.760 --> 3:51:08.600]  matter of time until we are struck again but this time with biological and
[3:51:08.600 --> 3:51:11.320]  chemical attacks the thought is scary but it's

[3:54:10.680 --> 3:54:13.240]  let's go ahead and kill that for me because i don't have a lot of time we
[3:54:13.240 --> 3:54:17.720]  got about five minutes left here now again
[3:54:17.720 --> 3:54:21.080]  being serious this is what's really surveilling you by tracking what you
[3:54:21.080 --> 3:54:23.400]  watch and what you do this is a scientific and landing
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:29.160]  cable box and if you look inside let's see if there's a camera in here
[3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:33.480]  oh right there hidden camera haha it's a joke folks i'm just joking
[3:54:33.480 --> 3:54:37.960]  and that's basically what that other guy looks like did was uh
[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:41.800]  you know basically engage in a hoax but maybe the guy wants to contact me we'll
[3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:46.200]  have that what looks like a hoaxer on the show
[3:54:46.200 --> 3:54:49.880]  we've got four minutes left ladies and gentlemen and i wanted to bring up
[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:53.560]  uh ten anderson of mitis resources ink because gold
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:54:56.920]  went up over a hundred dollars in the last uh week and a half
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:02.040]  it is right up there at the 973 level what it was basically yesterday i went
[3:55:02.040 --> 3:55:06.120]  as high as 983 but it's 973 this is the very last offer with
[3:55:06.120 --> 3:55:09.880]  this when ted bought gold at 865 he has price
[3:55:09.880 --> 3:55:13.720]  gold and silver silver at the nine dollar level
[3:55:13.720 --> 3:55:17.480]  gold at the uh eight 65 to 870 level
[3:55:17.480 --> 3:55:23.640]  silver's up at almost 15 bucks gold is right up at 973 so you will find no
[3:55:23.640 --> 3:55:26.520]  deals like this gold sold sold out almost everywhere else
[3:55:26.520 --> 3:55:30.120]  silver sold out check for yourself and the prices will be
[3:55:30.120 --> 3:55:33.240]  over a hundred dollars an ounce more everywhere you look i mean this
[3:55:33.240 --> 3:55:36.280]  and this is it he's out of the british sovereigns he's almost out of the
[3:55:36.280 --> 3:55:39.800]  francs he's running out of the silver ted told me on the phone during the break
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:44.360]  this is the last time he will offer this before it goes up
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:47.080]  uh ten i don't know what else to say to people should they take action or they
[3:55:47.080 --> 3:55:50.360]  should they keep trusting the fiat dollars that they now admit are being
[3:55:50.360 --> 3:55:53.240]  inflated no i mean obviously that would be the
