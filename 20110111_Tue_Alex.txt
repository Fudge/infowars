[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:31.740]  well the anti-gun anti-free speech crowd in the last three days since the tragic
[00:31.740 --> 00:37.800]  shooting there in Tucson Arizona has been involved in a full frontal assault now
[00:37.800 --> 00:43.920]  they're kind of breaking off some of that assault and having to face the facts
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.240]  that this guy was a complete and total fruit loop and registered as a
[00:49.240 --> 00:55.360]  independent and described as a liberal by his friends now we're getting a clear
[00:55.360 --> 01:00.760]  image from the neighbors of the father who was a very angry reclusive
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.600]  individual and the mother was a very very nice and I obviously they let their
[01:04.600 --> 01:10.120]  spoil brat mentally ill psychopathic son have his little devil shrine when he
[01:10.120 --> 01:14.320]  wasn't talking about how great abortion was he had the devil shrine in the
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.000]  backyard when the FBI showed up yesterday the family had the house
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.920]  barricaded ahead of I guess neighborhood assaults they were described by
[01:22.920 --> 01:28.680]  neighbors as the Adams family and that's why we have the second amendment is to
[01:28.680 --> 01:35.560]  protect ourselves from little spoiled brats turned into psychopathic devils
[01:35.560 --> 01:48.360]  like Jared Lee who will now go down in history mr. Loeffner as one more of those
[01:48.360 --> 01:54.320]  death obsessed lovers of death blood thirsty demonic individuals if you
[01:54.320 --> 02:05.200]  thought that my face my space Facebook photos of him were creepy now the new
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.960]  mugshot of him is even more creepy and we're gonna be showing that while I
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.000]  talk about him throughout the next hour for radio listeners you're saying
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.080]  you're gonna be showing us that obviously it's been all over the news all
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.880]  over television all over the newspapers across the country in the world today
[02:20.880 --> 02:25.680]  but we're also streaming live at prison planet TV for radio listeners that
[02:25.680 --> 02:31.600]  want to be able to tune in and listen to not just the audio stream but also
[02:31.600 --> 02:39.120]  visually watch this broadcast okay we got a break here in a few minutes and
[02:39.120 --> 02:44.280]  really officially start the full broadcast we're going to get into all
[02:44.280 --> 02:52.840]  the latest developments on the Jared Lee Loeffner front we're also going to get
[02:52.840 --> 02:57.760]  into the fact that it turns out that the suspect had made death threats in the
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.600]  past the sheriff when he's not blaming Rush Limbaugh or blaming free speech or
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.080]  the second amendment or Sarah Palin in the Tea Party it turns out that the
[03:08.080 --> 03:13.320]  specific death threats were made and you know it's funny we we've gotten death
[03:13.320 --> 03:17.120]  threats here before and the idiots will leave their name and number and then
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.160]  we'll go ahead just so there's a record of it in case they come around we got to
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.120]  defend ourselves we'll call the police and it's happened a lot in Austin and
[03:25.120 --> 03:27.760]  I'll sit there and talk to the detective and I'll say okay here's their name and
[03:27.760 --> 03:31.400]  number I want you to call them and they'll call them and the person will
[03:31.400 --> 03:37.800]  just say oh I was just joking and the Austin police don't say hey come in and
[03:37.800 --> 03:41.720]  press charges I know I could force it through and demand it but they don't
[03:41.720 --> 03:45.440]  really want me to press charges it's just kind of oh well you can defend
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.520]  yourself if they come around but I think it is important I think the next time
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.600]  we can identify somebody who makes a death threat here that I'm gonna go
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.040]  ahead and go to the trouble to go down and file charges on them I think we've
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.200]  gotten two lax all of us with putting up with things like this whether it's to a
[04:02.200 --> 04:08.680]  congressperson or to a mayor or to a police chief or a judge or a school
[04:08.680 --> 04:13.960]  teacher or an auto mechanic a medical doctor it doesn't matter somebody
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.400]  threatens to kill you you need to file a complaint with the police and you need
[04:19.400 --> 04:25.200]  to press charges on that front I mean if they clearly say I'm gonna come stick a
[04:25.200 --> 04:30.360]  gun to your head and I'm gonna pull the trigger that we had a schizophrenic just
[04:30.360 --> 04:36.360]  a few months ago sound like a redneck schizophrenic call up say Alex Baird
[04:36.360 --> 04:40.000]  or quit calling my house might have been prank callers too they have those
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.520]  soundboard things people record my voice and do things like that I'm gonna
[04:43.520 --> 04:47.840]  come down there I'm gonna put a gun to his head and I'm gonna pull the trigger
[04:47.840 --> 04:52.920]  and then I call the idiot so you know you better not call here and do that and
[04:52.920 --> 04:57.680]  I left a message at the number then I call the police these people are nuts
[04:57.680 --> 04:59.760]  we'll be right back

[06:13.040 --> 06:16.640]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[06:16.640 --> 06:21.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[06:21.080 --> 06:25.320]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[06:25.320 --> 06:29.080]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.080 --> 06:33.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.200 --> 06:37.160]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.160 --> 06:41.000]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[08:00.480 --> 08:16.840]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:16.840 --> 08:24.360]  well I bet the numerologists people are obsessed with numbers it's akin to the
[08:24.360 --> 08:31.760]  science or pseudoscience of astrology I'm at there having a field day today it
[08:31.760 --> 08:39.080]  is 1 1 1 1 I was signing some paperwork and documents this morning and just
[08:39.080 --> 08:46.560]  noticed that I was adding after my signature 1 comma 1 1 comma 1 1 or the
[08:46.560 --> 08:53.800]  first month the 11th day of the 11th year or it's the 11th year 11th day
[08:53.800 --> 08:59.840]  of the first month depending on how you look at it via US style or European
[08:59.840 --> 09:13.240]  calendar style one angle that hasn't been covered in the Giffords roll green
[09:13.240 --> 09:22.160]  shooting at the hands of the grim reaper mass murderer as I have dubbed him
[09:22.160 --> 09:28.600]  Jared Lee Loeffner and that's an angle covered by Paul Joseph Watson I think
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.480]  it's a very important aspect of this story establishment ignores violent
[09:33.480 --> 09:45.600]  rhetoric from eco leftist and we did on the Sunday show show the video of the
[09:45.600 --> 09:52.440]  1010 project financed by the British government showing children being murdered
[09:52.440 --> 09:59.280]  nine-year-olds in a private school setting in England being asked will you
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.280]  support carbon taxes what are you gonna do to cut your carbon output of carbon
[10:04.280 --> 10:10.320]  dioxide and of 20 plus students the vast majority say I'm gonna submit totally
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.320]  I'm not gonna take a hot bath you know things like that I'm you know gonna walk
[10:15.320 --> 10:20.560]  more places and several of the children say I'm not gonna do anything as the
[10:20.560 --> 10:24.840]  teacher says fine that's your choice and then she hits a red button and they
[10:24.840 --> 10:30.120]  explode flinging guts and blood and brain matter all over the teacher and the
[10:30.120 --> 10:34.880]  rest of the students and then it cuts to a boss at a company asking his
[10:34.880 --> 10:38.480]  employees who's gonna make cuts and the majority of course in a peer pressure
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.560]  system say yes but a minority says no so he murders them then it cuts to a
[10:43.560 --> 10:51.240]  soccer team the same thing it just goes on and on and on from there and there
[10:51.240 --> 10:57.320]  are all these other TV ads and messages in television programs and all these
[10:57.320 --> 11:00.900]  different editorial articles really by the thousands that I've seen over the
[11:00.900 --> 11:05.160]  years promoting that humans are parasites humans are scum humans are
[11:05.160 --> 11:13.560]  trash and that little baby humans are some type of larva of the devilish
[11:13.560 --> 11:17.800]  parasite because the social controllers know that if they can demonize babies and
[11:17.800 --> 11:23.280]  demonize children and kind of glamorize abortion like the new MTV show was doing
[11:23.280 --> 11:27.840]  how cool it is how chic it is to murder your baby in the womb and then write
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.080]  poetry about it you can't make this stuff up then you'll devalue all life and
[11:33.080 --> 11:37.240]  at the end of every nature show that I've seen for decades they demonize
[11:37.240 --> 11:42.160]  humans at the end and show how horrible we are we're being taught to hate
[11:42.160 --> 11:47.680]  ourselves and to be guilty and then to pay taxes and lower our standards of
[11:47.680 --> 11:52.840]  living and give up our liberties and be surveilled the name of the new eco
[11:52.840 --> 11:59.000]  religion and it's all anti-human and it's it's it's all about population
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.160]  reduction and one of the sacraments of it is abortion and hating your fellow
[12:04.160 --> 12:09.840]  man and dreaming about forced population reduction I mean it's just pushed
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.680]  everywhere like Newsweek last year with the cover the case for killing granny
[12:14.680 --> 12:20.080]  admitting the death panels and how great it is and then having a some set
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.480]  system where there's a set size of the pie and if you're gonna get ahead
[12:25.480 --> 12:31.400]  somebody's got to lose instead of a win-win-win type psychological economic
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.080]  outlook that is the real reality and that can bring humanity forward and
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.200]  onward and upward to the stars they want to turn us against each other so what
[12:39.200 --> 12:43.800]  does Bill Gates say well if we don't give granny health care we can hire ten
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.400]  teachers but if we don't we've got to lay them off they're they're turning us
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.320]  against each other you know I hear mainline leftist who mean well all the
[12:53.320 --> 12:56.440]  time on talk radio and read their articles in the news and they describe
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.560]  how the pie is only one size and how we've got to take from the rich to give
[13:00.560 --> 13:05.440]  to the poor well the real system is the ultra rich control the big governments
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.440]  of the world and they use that as a system to consolidate the wealth into
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.520]  their own hands vertically integrate it and then shut down avenues for new wealth
[13:14.520 --> 13:18.520]  formation by the middle class and it's been that way throughout history the
[13:18.520 --> 13:24.320]  ultra elite is always waging war against the middle class and it was they
[13:24.320 --> 13:28.840]  failed to suppress the middle class in the Renaissance in Europe starting
[13:28.840 --> 13:34.360]  about 500 years ago and this whole new world order and Malthusian economics and
[13:34.360 --> 13:43.480]  mercantilism and which is its modern name is globalism that is all an attempt to
[13:43.480 --> 13:49.360]  end the Renaissance and bring in a new dark age of control and so everything
[13:49.360 --> 13:53.520]  we do here is to educate people about that real scenario that real paradigm
[13:53.520 --> 14:02.920]  and to resist it now continuing here now this article again is from prison
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.120]  planet calm establishment ignores violent rhetoric from eco leftist all
[14:08.120 --> 14:11.400]  the establishment has invoked the supposed threat of vitriolic right-wing
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.400]  rhetoric as a tool with which to bludgeon freedom of speech and response to
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.960]  Tucson shootings it has conspired to sweep under the carpet the far more
[14:21.960 --> 14:26.680]  extreme and threatening language and images used by so-called leftists in
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.080]  the context of the climate change debate rhetoric that has led directly to
[14:31.080 --> 14:37.800]  crimes and murders while Sarah Palin is castigated for using an image of
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.760]  crosshairs targeting political districts leftist produce violent and bloody
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.300]  films that depict children being liquidated in an orgy of blood and
[14:45.300 --> 14:50.040]  guts for not towing the line of the political dogma of man-made global
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.440]  warming you've had all these weird cases of parents shooting their babies
[14:54.440 --> 15:00.000]  shooting their toddlers and then shooting themselves we've seen cases of
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.280]  that people setting their own houses on fire burning it up chanting it's for
[15:04.280 --> 15:08.120]  the earth it's for the earth we've seen you know the guy taken over the
[15:08.120 --> 15:11.920]  discovery channel facility because it's for the earth and the humans were
[15:11.920 --> 15:18.360]  parasites when we see it constantly out there and it's lauded and praised as if
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.320]  it's something good and now we have the democrat governor running in the
[15:23.320 --> 15:30.480]  campaign for us senate in west virginia firing a 30 odd six through the cap and
[15:30.480 --> 15:37.680]  trade bill you've got now a lot of cases documented at info wars dot com
[15:37.680 --> 15:40.800]  present on it dot com drudge reports got a bunch of them up where they're
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.600]  calling for Sarah Palin's murder and putting crosshairs on her or Democrats
[15:45.600 --> 15:50.920]  putting crosshairs on districts they wanted or Obama saying let's bring guns
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.880]  the republicans bring a knife we're gonna bring guns to that knife fight all
[15:55.880 --> 16:02.480]  of this is symbolic and it's part of the political discourse and so when the
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.920]  Democrats hypocritically try to come in and say in this rhetoric when when I
[16:07.920 --> 16:13.520]  really looked at it from a nonpartisan perspective outside the left-right
[16:13.520 --> 16:21.320]  paradigm the left are some of the most vicious race baiters and hate promoters
[16:21.320 --> 16:28.960]  and balkanizers and people that use military terminology even more than
[16:28.960 --> 16:32.720]  the republicans but hey I've got an idea how about we follow the first
[16:32.720 --> 16:36.560]  amendment doesn't matter if you're an atheist a libertarian a communist a
[16:36.560 --> 16:41.720]  liberal a conservative a freedom lover that's what I call myself that's the
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.440]  best way to describe what I'm into how about we just all have our freedom of
[16:45.440 --> 16:52.040]  speech and as long as you don't say kill someone as long as you don't go on air
[16:52.040 --> 16:56.000]  or go up to somebody at the checkout counter and say I'm gonna kill you
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  you're a okay as long as you don't tell people to go kill people remember
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.200]  Michael Reagan we could play the clip here if you doubt it just search the
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.480]  term Michael Reagan says kill mark dice mark dice frequent guest on this show
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.960]  had questioned the official 9-11 story isn't six of the 10 9-11 commissioners
[17:14.960 --> 17:21.040]  have and Michael Reagan said I will pay for the bullets this is where he lives
[17:21.040 --> 17:27.120]  I'm serious he said I'm serious I want you to kill him I will pay you to kill
[17:27.120 --> 17:30.720]  him I will pay for the bullets and we need to line up all the other 9-11
[17:30.720 --> 17:37.120]  truthers and shoot them now the FBI was called mark dice did get threats by the
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.040]  way it I'm going from memory to happen a few years ago but at work and all over
[17:42.040 --> 17:50.480]  the place and nothing was done in fact Michael Reagan had YouTube pulling it
[17:50.480 --> 17:53.760]  down all over the Internet including they tried to do it on our channel but
[17:53.760 --> 17:59.080]  we filed against them in federal court and they they had to remove their fake
[17:59.080 --> 18:04.480]  claim because it was fair use somebody's calling for a murder and a hit and
[18:04.480 --> 18:10.840]  we're playing it and responding we have absolute right to do that 100% no doubts
[18:10.840 --> 18:18.100]  about that but so so the courts were there to to to help Michael Reagan say
[18:18.100 --> 18:23.280]  kill people and and even if you disagree with people who believe the official
[18:23.280 --> 18:27.240]  fairy tale about 9-11 or folks that don't believe in it it's all they're
[18:27.240 --> 18:31.600]  right you don't say go to go kill them go to their house go to their work I'll
[18:31.600 --> 18:39.480]  pay for the bullets murder them you know you you hear these calls and it came
[18:39.480 --> 18:43.600]  out two weeks ago that in a major law enforcement symposium it made national
[18:43.600 --> 18:48.080]  news here in the US that the main speaker was telling police local police
[18:48.080 --> 18:51.240]  from all over the country there were thousands of them there that we need to
[18:51.240 --> 18:54.480]  go ahead and just kill all them the quote Muslims because they're all
[18:54.480 --> 18:59.880]  terrorists and go ahead and kill their children too and then the reporters were
[18:59.880 --> 19:02.280]  asking the cops there do you agree with that and they're like yeah you heard them
[19:02.280 --> 19:08.080]  see this is the mind control I mean how do you think the Nazis did what they did
[19:08.080 --> 19:12.200]  Hitler demonized certain groups blame those groups for everything got a big
[19:12.200 --> 19:14.760]  tribal
[19:14.760 --> 19:20.320]  fervor going and Germans who were very moral people I mean I've studied that
[19:20.320 --> 19:24.160]  culture from the contemporary historians and anthropologists and
[19:24.160 --> 19:29.520]  sociologists at the time Germans were very moral very low crime rate follow the
[19:29.520 --> 19:33.960]  rules all that stuff but they had that weakness for following orders so they did
[19:33.960 --> 19:37.240]  all those things same thing with the Soviets and the Russians but but I'm
[19:37.240 --> 19:42.040]  done talking about that I want to run through some of the latest developments
[19:42.040 --> 19:49.480]  dealing with the shooter Jared Lee Loeffner some big developments then we're
[19:49.480 --> 19:53.920]  gonna open the phones up and then we've got David Ike joining us the Southern
[19:53.920 --> 19:59.080]  Poverty Law Center with Keith Oberman on MSNBC they say it's all his fault that

[21:08.600 --> 21:12.400]  finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[21:12.400 --> 21:16.560]  Americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in
[21:16.560 --> 21:21.400]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all
[21:21.400 --> 21:26.680]  of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the
[21:26.680 --> 21:31.480]  enemies of our nation the criminal off-shore cartel held bent on destroying
[21:31.480 --> 21:35.440]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[21:35.440 --> 21:39.640]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[21:39.640 --> 21:43.640]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right

[22:04.680 --> 22:09.000]  stories about property seizures frozen bank accounts confiscation of stocks and
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.640]  bonds it makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right

[22:16.960 --> 22:21.880]  and money laundering act the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the trading

[22:58.200 --> 23:02.720]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.440]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know
[23:06.440 --> 23:10.160]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[23:10.160 --> 23:13.680]  or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this
[23:13.680 --> 23:17.480]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[23:17.480 --> 23:21.920]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[23:21.920 --> 23:26.960]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[23:26.960 --> 23:30.680]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[23:30.680 --> 23:34.480]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[23:34.480 --> 23:39.480]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank com

[23:46.080 --> 23:54.360]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[23:54.360 --> 24:00.000]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank com
[24:00.000 --> 24:09.280]  the reason we've got David Ike former head of the Green Party over in England
[24:09.280 --> 24:13.680]  best-selling author one of the better known quote conspiracy theorists in the
[24:13.680 --> 24:21.840]  world is because doing research on the Grim Reaper Tucson shooter that's the
[24:21.840 --> 24:26.200]  biggest news story right now in the world not just in the United States it's
[24:26.200 --> 24:30.840]  big news all over the planet and being used to further disarm populations
[24:30.840 --> 24:35.720]  while governments continue to be one of the number one causes of death they
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.800]  never hype that up and play that up or the millions of children that died in
[24:40.800 --> 24:46.080]  World War two in Germany in Europe in Russia in Asia there's never a
[24:46.080 --> 24:51.640]  discussion of those millions as Stalin said one person dies it's a tragedy
[24:51.640 --> 24:58.360]  10,000 die it's a statistic the media is not hyping that up but we've got Ike
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.160]  coming on in about an hour from now or a little more than an hour bottom of the
[25:02.160 --> 25:07.000]  next hour because it's just so crazy to have the southern property law centers
[25:07.000 --> 25:16.960]  director of research potok get up on television and say that I ran and then
[25:16.960 --> 25:28.320]  David Ike are to blame when the Grim Reaper devil worshipper nihilistic
[25:28.320 --> 25:35.800]  political independent said nothing about David Ike and they talked about lucid or
[25:35.800 --> 25:40.600]  awake dreaming in one of his rambling videos I mean lucid or wide awake
[25:40.600 --> 25:46.280]  dreaming I saw a Tucson newspaper yesterday saying it's my fault or that I
[25:46.280 --> 25:49.880]  could be connected because I'm in the Richard Link letter movie waking life
[25:49.880 --> 25:55.760]  about lucid awake dreaming I mean there have been books written about it for
[25:55.760 --> 26:03.560]  hundreds of years I'm in a movie put out about it by Fox Searchlight I guess
[26:03.560 --> 26:15.960]  Fox is to blame the Tucson Sheriff for Pinal County I mean I don't need to play
[26:15.960 --> 26:18.360]  the clip here you know it's one of the biggest stories in the country right
[26:18.360 --> 26:24.800]  now top of the drudge report ABC news top story they're actually at ABC we
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.440]  were covering it like I mean the drudge report is just pointing out the
[26:29.440 --> 26:35.320]  absurdity but ABC and others are taking it serious like yeah maybe Rush Limbaugh
[26:35.320 --> 26:42.760]  caused this some screwed up drug down clearly schizophrenic freak has all the
[26:42.760 --> 26:46.800]  hallmarks of being under mind control told people he was under mind control told
[26:46.800 --> 26:50.080]  others that he was concerned about mind control I mean I don't know what the
[26:50.080 --> 26:55.280]  truth is but we know those programs exist and then magically he shows up and
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.840]  shoots all these people reportedly only got one 18 round clip out and shot 18
[27:00.840 --> 27:05.400]  people killing six I mean I'm a great shot with a handgun and I've got high
[27:05.400 --> 27:10.000]  capacity glocks myself that take the 30 round you were it sticks out on the
[27:10.000 --> 27:18.280]  bottom I've got that for defense and I'm a good shot but I couldn't imagine
[27:18.280 --> 27:25.120]  walking around shooting people and calmly hitting all 18 of my targets and
[27:25.120 --> 27:31.160]  that's just amazing this whole thing is very very suspicious and it stinks to
[27:31.160 --> 27:36.480]  high heaven and this judge role was very patriotic I had ruled against Clinton
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.360]  on the Brady Act the best federal judge out there according to Sheriff Richard
[27:41.360 --> 27:47.000]  Mack who of course was the sheriff there in that Arizona County that dealt with
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.760]  that back in 1994 big Supreme Court case one of the most important in history
[27:51.760 --> 27:56.280]  even more important than the one just a few years ago or last year to the second
[27:56.280 --> 28:04.000]  amendment but I wanted to go ahead and first play this clip where Chip Burleigh
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.920]  that sounds like some kind of sandwich you get at Chick-fil-A Chip Burleigh
[28:08.920 --> 28:17.280]  implies that Ron Paul and and and Alex Jones this is on democracy now fed out
[28:17.280 --> 28:24.040]  all over the country aired on NPR stations aired on PBS TV stations I'm
[28:24.040 --> 28:28.560]  subjected to it every day here in Austin and and and here I am being
[28:28.560 --> 28:34.080]  blamed for this and and Rush Limbaugh is being blamed I mean this is outrageous
[28:34.080 --> 28:39.240]  and this is defamation this is slander this is libel you can put whatever name
[28:39.240 --> 28:44.520]  you want on it but because Ron Paul wants to follow the Constitution and have
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.320]  constitutional money and this guy made one rambling statement about about a new
[28:49.320 --> 28:53.600]  monetary system it's all our fault we should just let the federal reserve
[28:53.600 --> 28:58.520]  devalue the currency here's that short clip or part of it from democracy now
[28:58.520 --> 29:04.400]  with the Ford Foundation Bill Gates found a foundation funded a propaganda
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.240]  here it is well as a southern property law center points out comes from a
[29:08.240 --> 29:15.800]  patriot icon named David Wynn Miller of Milwaukee who has a whole website talking
[29:15.800 --> 29:21.000]  about the use of grammar and numbers as a way of mind control to keep people from
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.600]  focusing on the great federal reserve conspiracy theory the idea that the
[29:25.600 --> 29:30.880]  federal reserve was created as part of a vast conspiracy is not just embedded in
[29:30.880 --> 29:35.200]  the minds of people who are disturbed but it's widely shared on you know Alex
[29:35.200 --> 29:42.320]  Jones website and and by Ron Paul elected representative Ron Paul so what
[29:42.320 --> 29:48.840]  we have here is a right-wing milieu in which mr. Lothner apparently wandered
[29:48.840 --> 29:55.520]  through and posted in March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[32:11.080 --> 32:14.480]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be

[33:31.880 --> 33:40.160]  a chip filet one of these left-wing people that runs around demonizing
[33:40.160 --> 33:46.360]  anyone that wants liberty and freedom and they pose as if they are you know
[33:46.360 --> 33:52.280]  nonpartisan think tank pointy head experts telling you about the dangerous
[33:52.280 --> 33:56.880]  extremists remember they'd make jokes at the Southern Slime Center and other
[33:56.880 --> 34:02.360]  organizations for years there's no world government there's no plan to devalue the
[34:02.360 --> 34:08.200]  dollar the Federal Reserve isn't private anyone that says it is that's code
[34:08.200 --> 34:12.840]  for racism but they've gone too far now saying if you don't like health care
[34:12.840 --> 34:19.840]  that's code for not liking black people and folks started going what oh and the
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.800]  ADL came out against Glenn Beck why he's talking about about George Soros
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.920]  helping round up and rob Jews that's anti-Semitic well I mean I've got a 60

[34:51.720 --> 35:00.200]  against George Soros I mean media matters all these organizations they're
[35:00.200 --> 35:04.440]  funded by Ford Foundation they're funded by Soros they're funded by other big
[35:04.440 --> 35:09.520]  globalist they're funded by Bill and Melinda Gates to go out there and shut
[35:09.520 --> 35:13.080]  up anybody that doesn't want government health care but Bill Gates at least is
[35:13.080 --> 35:19.520]  honest well if you take the end of care for say an old grandma you could not
[35:19.520 --> 35:26.640]  lay off 10 teachers the patient and then Times of London headlines secret

[35:33.720 --> 35:38.680]  themselves and so now it's all over the news every day global government
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.280]  Bilderberg group you'll pay your taxes to a private IMF World Bank consortium
[35:43.280 --> 35:50.440]  carbon taxes national VAT taxes and I get to have chip filet berlet it's
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.400]  running chip berlet against like a potato chip or something constantly over
[35:55.400 --> 36:01.160]  the years harrying me running around telling weak-minded people that that
[36:01.160 --> 36:06.800]  Ron Paul and myself and others are supposedly you know generating this
[36:06.800 --> 36:13.680]  atmosphere that caused this guy to go off and now we learn these people are
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.680]  like the Adams family mommy worked for the government daddy was always getting
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.480]  arguments with the neighbors and was quote very angry the guy is an atheist
[36:23.480 --> 36:28.240]  that's what I always found these the these vampire dressing rim reaper type of
[36:28.240 --> 36:34.160]  you know vampire wannabe groups they always say they're atheists when they're
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.880]  wearing a devil shirt and painting their fingernails black and it's like and you
[36:39.880 --> 36:43.400]  know they're and then you go what do you listen to on that iPad oh here it's
[36:43.400 --> 36:50.160]  devil what devil slaughter murder death kill the children there one time I got
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.240]  drug by one of my cousins to kind of see a main line in college rock and roll
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.560]  band and we took some dates out to it and we go in and it and they had
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.400]  Marilyn Manson before Marilyn Manson was popular really known and he was I
[37:03.400 --> 37:07.400]  walk in and there's this skinny guy looks like a concentration camp victim
[37:07.400 --> 37:12.660]  and he's vomiting on stage and the name of the record I guess at that time was
[37:12.660 --> 37:17.560]  smells like children and there were little toddler onesies stapled up on
[37:17.560 --> 37:21.320]  the speakers and he was throwing them to people screaming about murdering
[37:21.320 --> 37:24.800]  children how much fun it was and needless to say we left in about five
[37:24.800 --> 37:32.840]  minutes I was like is this really and and this is what young weird soft people
[37:32.840 --> 37:41.840]  who I guess never had any adventures never had any hardship or when they did
[37:41.840 --> 37:45.400]  get beat up when they were 12 mommy and daddy got real mad about it they didn't
[37:45.400 --> 37:49.360]  tell junior go out and fight back so then they just sit there getting beat up
[37:49.360 --> 37:53.480]  on so they decided to be scary vampire people and to you know go around trying
[37:53.480 --> 37:57.120]  to intimidate people then they go buy guns and they go and shoot people
[37:57.120 --> 38:03.160]  Harris and climb old it's the same story every time that's why Sunday I called
[38:03.160 --> 38:10.040]  it I said this guy's a devil worshiper this guy's a vampire wannabe I could
[38:10.040 --> 38:14.480]  listen to the music in his favorite video that grim reaper character out
[38:14.480 --> 38:19.560]  there burning the American flag all his atheist stuff all his talk about how
[38:19.560 --> 38:24.980]  great abortion is and I called it I know these people it isn't hard to call it
[38:24.980 --> 38:27.880]  it's kind of like you're in a deer stand and a coyote runs out well that's a
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.840]  coyote or a timber wolf runs out that's a timber wolf or a white-tailed doe
[38:33.840 --> 38:37.800]  comes out or you see one come out with a baby that's got spots on it that's a
[38:37.800 --> 38:43.920]  fine or you see a big fat red breasted blackbird hopping around on the ground
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.240]  that's a robin you know I I've got my instincts I've got my brain I know how
[38:49.240 --> 38:55.600]  to assess people okay and then meanwhile I'm sorry American flag burning devil
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.600]  worshipping abortion lovers are not Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones or Ron Paul
[39:01.600 --> 39:07.160]  influence people let's get that straight now it is true that the hottest thing on
[39:07.160 --> 39:10.920]  the internet and the hottest thing in culture is reforming the currency and
[39:10.920 --> 39:15.520]  getting rid of the Federal Reserve and restoring our sovereignty as he said
[39:15.520 --> 39:19.320]  last year is the bigger presence key to the CFR for the first time in history
[39:19.320 --> 39:23.120]  because of technology the people are awake and have recognized the global
[39:23.120 --> 39:26.400]  elite and how they're pulling the strings and the globalists are in trouble
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.840]  so yes you are gonna have more schizophrenics and more nuts now
[39:30.840 --> 39:35.000]  attracted to this because it's the hottest issue out there why do you think
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.240]  they let conspiracy theory on TV then it was so effective they're trying to
[39:39.240 --> 39:44.440]  quietly pull it and I've confirmed by insiders at TV networks I mean I have the
[39:44.440 --> 39:47.000]  documents but I'm not allowed to show them because it would identify who did it
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.040]  this is not from the production company of the show or Ventura this is from
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.360]  people inside who program the computers the the DVRs nationwide and companies
[39:57.360 --> 40:02.200]  that that run those agreements there's all sorts of threats of litigation
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.560]  going on you name it some cable systems are refusing to delete the entire Jesse
[40:07.560 --> 40:12.680]  Ventura two seasons oh yes they're now Time Warner is now giving orders that
[40:12.680 --> 40:22.600]  they all be deleted unprecedented they've got this other guy he's here in my
[40:22.600 --> 40:30.800]  new stack and it's also up on Drudge today who's put out the show decoded on
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.160]  History Channel and he's in the news today admitting that he secretly has
[40:35.160 --> 40:40.360]  worked for the government and you know they got me to be in their Bohemian
[40:40.360 --> 40:47.680]  Grove episode they've now listed for what the 27th of this month and I've
[40:47.680 --> 40:51.480]  agreed to not talk about it a lot until it comes out but I have my misgivings
[40:51.480 --> 41:00.320]  I'll just tell you that and once I got on the ground with them well you can read
[41:00.320 --> 41:05.880]  the story it's up on info wars.com prisonpunna.com it's also up on Drudge
[41:05.880 --> 41:11.760]  it's one of the top stories there how do you pronounce it Brad Metzler Metzler
[41:11.760 --> 41:19.320]  it's Metzler it's here it is it's New York Daily News author Brad Metzler was
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.920]  recruited in government agency horrified how easy it is to attack US and he's the
[41:23.920 --> 41:30.960]  star of and the writer of these you know conspiracy shows and in the one episode
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.600]  I've watched part of because I'm busy and I don't really watch television it's a
[41:34.600 --> 41:38.800]  woman Mark Dyson you know they're making fun of Mark saying the Statue of
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.600]  Liberty is really a man in drag and that it's Lucifer and then they go to top
[41:43.600 --> 41:50.640]  professors who go yes it is Lucifer but it's the good Lucifer I mean it is
[41:50.640 --> 41:55.200]  Lucifer okay the French Illuminati built the stinking thing and gave it to us
[41:55.200 --> 41:59.640]  and that's what it is but but see it is Lucifer but it's the good Lucifer but
[41:59.640 --> 42:05.080]  we're cooks for knowing it's Lucifer and not liking it kind of like there is a
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.000]  world government but you still are going to cause the loving little devil
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.400]  worshipers to go shoot people if you're against the world government it's not
[42:14.400 --> 42:17.480]  that this world government's coming in and causing all this friction and all
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.440]  these crises and that nuts are gonna go off because of it and we've got this
[42:22.440 --> 42:26.760]  major tectonic global banking movement towards tyranny and oppression and
[42:26.760 --> 42:31.280]  cutting off resources to populations in a post-industrial world you know that's
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.800]  gonna create friction and fireworks and the globalist engineers know that full
[42:34.800 --> 42:40.440]  well and say they're gonna capitalize on the chaos to bring in their order and
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.640]  then Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones and Ron Paul and Sarah Palin are gonna be
[42:45.640 --> 42:52.320]  blamed in the process I mean this guy talked about awake dreaming and now
[42:52.320 --> 42:57.280]  they're saying it is Alex Jones it is the movie waking life and they're
[42:57.280 --> 43:00.280]  blaming David Ike who doesn't even talk about awake dreaming that I've heard
[43:00.280 --> 43:05.840]  we've got him coming up I mean this is insane but but this is their guilt by
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.320]  association let's go ahead and play that play that clip again of Chip Filet
[43:10.320 --> 43:16.760]  here he is used in the Patriot and far right movements to describe the 13th
[43:16.760 --> 43:21.160]  14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution which freed the slaves and
[43:21.160 --> 43:25.760]  gave the right of citizenship to anyone born in the United States
[43:25.760 --> 43:32.440]  so see our racist is to basically it costs conspiracies in which it is a
[43:32.440 --> 43:36.760]  what does that have to do with anything about these people you know don't think
[43:36.760 --> 43:41.360]  black should have freedom what and then it's always oh they don't like the
[43:41.360 --> 43:45.640]  health care that's code for not liking black people oh they're criticizing the
[43:45.640 --> 43:50.040]  White House staff budget why is that Chris Matthews well they just don't like
[43:50.040 --> 43:56.840]  Michelle Obama because she's black gee we're gonna have thunderstorms today why
[43:56.840 --> 44:02.840]  is that because because there's black people I like cheese on my hamburger oh
[44:02.840 --> 44:08.880]  because you don't like black people I like to wear a blue sports jacket today
[44:08.880 --> 44:12.640]  because you don't like black people did you wear that white shirt mr. Jones
[44:12.640 --> 44:16.160]  because it's a symbol of not like black people come on let's be honest about it
[44:16.160 --> 44:20.960]  I mean they'll just nonsensically inject it into everything to punch those
[44:20.960 --> 44:25.200]  buttons to get people to get to become emotional all right let's let's sorry
[44:25.200 --> 44:28.960]  let's finish the clip here pressing the people and perhaps in his mind
[44:28.960 --> 44:34.880]  engaging in mind control on behalf of vested interests who control the money
[44:34.880 --> 44:41.640]  this is a long-standing right-wing conspiracy theory this issue of grammar
[44:41.640 --> 44:46.680]  well as the Southern Poverty Law Center points out comes from a patriot icon
[44:46.680 --> 44:53.160]  named David Wynn Miller of Milwaukee who has a whole website talking about the
[44:53.160 --> 44:57.840]  use of grammar and numbers as a way of mind control to keep people from
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.400]  focusing on the great Federal Reserve conspiracy theory the idea that the
[45:02.400 --> 45:07.560]  Federal Reserve was created as part of a vast conspiracy is not just embedded
[45:07.560 --> 45:12.040]  in the minds of people who are disturbed but it's widely shared on you know Alex
[45:12.040 --> 45:19.080]  Jones website and and by Ron Paul elected representative Ron Paul so what
[45:19.080 --> 45:25.680]  we have here is a right-wing milieu in which mr. Lothner apparently wandered
[45:25.680 --> 45:31.600]  through and posted information about his own beliefs no it just goes on I'm done
[45:31.600 --> 45:34.960]  I can't hear anymore but thank you let's get the next clip ready please and then
[45:34.960 --> 45:38.640]  we're open the phones up to get your comment on all the things that are
[45:38.640 --> 45:41.600]  happening politically right now but obviously specifically what you really
[45:41.600 --> 45:44.680]  thinks going on with this shooting and all the new bills being introduced a
[45:44.680 --> 45:50.640]  little bit how much ammo you can buy or have or to restrict handguns I flipped
[45:50.640 --> 45:54.680]  through the channels and heard many of the talk show host this morning on XM
[45:54.680 --> 45:59.640]  including Howard Stern calling for banning handguns I mean this is just
[45:59.640 --> 46:04.920]  outrageous absolutely outrageous all that would ensure is that if folks hadn't
[46:04.920 --> 46:10.760]  tackled this guy the other person that came up and was also involved into
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.680]  doing them wouldn't have had a gun to stop this guy if he needed it I mean it
[46:15.680 --> 46:21.120]  it's total common sense and they know it but but now it's a right-wing
[46:21.120 --> 46:27.120]  conspiracy theory to talk about the Federal Reserve being private or they're
[46:27.120 --> 46:33.960]  being a conspiracy to set it up they just had the 100th anniversary of the 19
[46:33.960 --> 46:40.440]  oh 10 meeting at Jekyll Island Georgia and Bernanke current head of the Fed a
[46:40.440 --> 46:44.200]  bunch of other top bankers including Alan Greenspan former head of the Fed
[46:44.200 --> 46:49.440]  chairman they all went there and gave creepy speeches about the criminality
[46:49.440 --> 46:53.680]  of the banks and how a hundred years ago their predecessors met secretly there
[46:53.680 --> 46:58.320]  to say this is they publicly meet and laugh at everyone about their secret
[46:58.320 --> 47:01.400]  meeting and at the time they heads of the big private banks that are now the
[47:01.400 --> 47:05.680]  shareholders the private Fed they own the big newspapers and ran this is all
[47:05.680 --> 47:10.080]  admitted now column after column where they were saying they were against the
[47:10.080 --> 47:14.280]  Federal Reserve Act see they they they wrote it gave it to their congressman
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.600]  they own this is all come out they admit this this is in mainline you know
[47:18.600 --> 47:22.480]  New York Times best-selling books written by the establishment written by
[47:22.480 --> 47:27.680]  these guys so they did this this this con game where they said oh please don't
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.360]  throw me in the briar patch and that's exactly where briar rabbit wanted to go
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.040]  they write it up they come out and say we don't want that Federal Reserve Act
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.440]  oh just like we didn't want the Sherman anti-trust act oh that let us make all
[47:40.440 --> 47:46.720]  our robber baron money tax-free it's horrible they wrote that as well the
[47:46.720 --> 47:50.080]  average person doesn't even know what the Sherman anti-trust act is much less
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.160]  than it was a shill operation so see that like oh we don't want that'll
[47:54.160 --> 47:58.640]  reserve that'll run everything and control us and and because everybody knew
[47:58.640 --> 48:02.360]  then the banks were big and corrupt Thomas Jefferson and written about it
[48:02.360 --> 48:07.400]  Benjamin Franklin George Washington later Lincoln had written about it before
[48:07.400 --> 48:13.480]  him Andrew Jackson I mean that's what elections were about was the money power
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.760]  but now the perceived knowledge for the average American is it's kooky and weird
[48:18.760 --> 48:22.760]  to talk about the Federal Reserve for decades that's been the view in the 60s
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.960]  70s 80s 90s not anymore people have rediscovered offshore banks the same
[48:27.960 --> 48:30.880]  ones that have destroyed all these third world countries and made them dependent
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.240]  through the money power the power to issue fiat currency at will allows them
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.720]  the unfair trade advantage to buy off governments and take over and this guy
[48:40.720 --> 48:45.840]  is still giving you the old tired line that it's a conspiracy theory and that
[48:45.840 --> 48:51.880]  and that this contributed to this malaise this this this morass this swamp
[48:51.880 --> 48:59.120]  that this guy was in that's incredible let's go ahead and play the Southern
[48:59.120 --> 49:06.840]  Poverty Law Center minion on with Keith Oberman blaming this on Ayn Rand and
[49:06.840 --> 49:12.240]  David Ikevall people here it is well you're right that reading through all
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.920]  of his materials or the materials that are purported to be his that he sounds
[49:16.920 --> 49:23.160]  quite mad out of his mind but there is a thread through the material that really
[49:23.160 --> 49:28.680]  seems pretty clear and that thread has to do with seeing the government as an
[49:28.680 --> 49:32.680]  enemy the books you mentioned there's a theme that runs through all of them
[49:32.680 --> 49:38.040]  particular the Ayn Rand book the idea of the individual against the state but
[49:38.040 --> 49:42.680]  there are ideas like the idea of the only legitimate currency being backed by
[49:42.680 --> 49:47.640]  gold and silver you know that's a core idea of the radical right in this
[49:47.640 --> 49:53.360]  country the idea weirdly enough of controlling grammar of somehow the
[49:53.360 --> 50:00.120]  government using grammar to control the people is an idea that exists on the
[50:00.120 --> 50:03.680]  radical right there's a particular person a man named David Wynn Miller who has
[50:03.680 --> 50:09.000]  plugged this idea over the years this man also talked quite a lot in these
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.160]  strange videos of his about what he called conscious dreaming but I think is
[50:14.160 --> 50:20.560]  almost certainly meant to be conscious streaming which is an idea that also has
[50:20.560 --> 50:24.040]  been kind of tossed around of the radical right in particular by a kind of
[50:24.040 --> 50:29.440]  British conspiracy theorist by the name of David Ike so a lot of these ideas his
[50:29.440 --> 50:34.740]  burning of the flag is talking about the government as treasonous and using mind
[50:34.740 --> 50:41.520]  control to control the rest that's enough so if you don't want to have
[50:41.520 --> 50:46.720]  private central banks destroy the currency and your savings if you want
[50:46.720 --> 50:49.440]  the Congress to take control the issuance of currency and credit as the
[50:49.440 --> 50:54.640]  Constitution states you heard it it's a radical conspiracy theory and it's
[50:54.640 --> 50:58.200]  causing people to dress up like grim reapers and burn the American flag it's
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.960]  all our fault we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most

[52:12.880 --> 52:17.200]  the Americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in
[52:17.200 --> 52:22.280]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[52:22.280 --> 52:27.320]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the
[52:27.320 --> 52:32.120]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying

[52:36.120 --> 52:40.280]  Bernanke and arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying

[54:11.000 --> 54:16.520]  245 kind of rod at his shoulder and there at the hip and everybody knew you didn't
[54:16.520 --> 54:25.480]  give no lip to the big John. The big news today is that big John Arizona suspect
[54:25.480 --> 54:29.480]  had made death threats the sheriff said they never did anything about it a death
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.720]  threat is a terroristic threat and is illegal and if the threat was something
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.240]  you were really thinking about carrying out it's even more time in prison but in
[54:40.240 --> 54:44.960]  this culture they allow people to make death threats and then nothing is done
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.560]  about it and then they say oh now all of you have to lose your liberties your
[54:52.560 --> 54:58.120]  freedoms because somebody acted out on this and now we've put together an
[54:58.120 --> 55:04.360]  article that I think shows premeditated knowledge of this liberal media was
[55:04.360 --> 55:10.180]  already prepared for violence and that's a good headline with Matt Ryan you
[55:10.180 --> 55:15.280]  probably just want to add so people know what it's in connotation liberal media
[55:15.280 --> 55:21.520]  was already prepared for violence in Tucson let's add in Tucson to that so
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.720]  folks know what's going on here continuing of the terrible shooting in
[55:26.720 --> 55:31.200]  Tucson Arizona left six dead including federal judge John Rohl and a critically
[55:31.200 --> 55:40.080]  injured representative Gabrielle Giffords was the act of a 22 year old
[55:40.080 --> 55:45.560]  that was immediately profiled as a tea party member just just well I mean he
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.040]  wasn't even just profiled they just made that up they just put out the false
[55:50.040 --> 55:55.320]  profile the mainstream media focused on two points in his many ramblings
[55:55.320 --> 55:58.680]  including government mind control and refusing to use a currency knocked back
[55:58.680 --> 56:03.240]  by gold or silver what is most curious about it is that it appears he was
[56:03.240 --> 56:07.720]  profiled as the shooter before there was even a shooting in multiple interviews
[56:07.720 --> 56:13.520]  representative Giffords the idea of a tea party activist using violence against
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.960]  her was brought up either right before or after the mention of the upcoming vote
[56:17.960 --> 56:26.120]  to recall controversial health care reform yeah and this is also part of
[56:26.120 --> 56:30.520]  hyping copycatters you know every time there's been a big school shooting and
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.600]  they hype it then we see aftershocks and more and they try to hype that then
[56:35.600 --> 56:39.480]  there's aftershocks of that then finally it doesn't have the shock value so the
[56:39.480 --> 56:43.680]  media doesn't cover it as much and it dissipates but weak-minded mentally ill
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.960]  people who are easily suggest suggestible or brainwash mind control
[56:48.960 --> 56:56.200]  Manchurian candidates that are out there operating this is then their trigger and
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.680]  he's got videos linked in here in the video below Congresswoman Gabrielle
[57:00.680 --> 57:03.800]  Giffords was interviewed about an incident where the front door of her
[57:03.800 --> 57:07.800]  office was shattered while stock footage of tea party protesters waving the
[57:07.800 --> 57:12.600]  gats in flag were rolling we know we've caught the Democrats over and over again
[57:12.600 --> 57:16.280]  knocking out their own windows I'm not saying she did this but it turned out in
[57:16.280 --> 57:19.280]  Denver and other areas they have been caught you know it's the famous thing
[57:19.280 --> 57:22.880]  of the white lady carving the Barack Obama on her face and then it saying
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.480]  black men did it and turned out she did it or black students are caught many
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.040]  times putting swastikas on their dorm or crosses in their yards same thing with
[57:32.040 --> 57:35.560]  Jewish students I mean this is something that doesn't matter what group it is they
[57:35.560 --> 57:40.600]  all do it for sympathy or I mean it's really a false flag it's a frame up the
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.160]  interview was steer in the direction that would indicate that the tea party is
[57:44.160 --> 57:48.120]  posing a threat against Democratic lawmakers they touch on Sarah Palin's
[57:48.120 --> 57:51.600]  use of crosshairs on the site explaining that this could potentially cause
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.200]  someone to use violence against the Democrats featured in the graphic and
[57:55.200 --> 58:00.160]  don't people see by by hyping that they're actually putting it in the
[58:00.160 --> 58:06.040]  minds of these people and it turns out that the Grim Reaper shooter Jared Lee
[58:06.040 --> 58:11.520]  Loeffner was obsessed with her at least three years back into 2007 three and a
[58:11.520 --> 58:17.320]  half years back and that he'd gone to her events he kept letters from her you
[58:17.320 --> 58:23.480]  know constituent letters in a safe and now there was all this constant hype of
[58:23.480 --> 58:27.120]  her on television over and over again are you worried the crosshairs they're
[58:27.120 --> 58:32.280]  coming to get you and they're watching was the schizophrenic easily
[58:32.280 --> 58:37.360]  suggestible so in a way it was just a culture of media mind control that
[58:37.360 --> 58:47.040]  contributed to this you could say that on air online and on demand we are the
[58:47.040 --> 58:54.400]  GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last
[58:54.400 --> 58:59.560]  century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing
[58:59.560 --> 59:03.760]  off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[59:03.760 --> 59:08.920]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[59:08.920 --> 59:13.680]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[59:13.680 --> 59:18.040]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[59:18.040 --> 59:23.320]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[59:23.320 --> 59:27.640]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[59:27.640 --> 59:31.120]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[59:31.120 --> 59:36.360]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[59:36.360 --> 59:42.360]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at

[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:11.720]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well

[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.240]  Texas. Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.600]  Alright we're into hour number two and I've been rambling in the last 60
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.600]  minutes I got David Ike joining us for 30 minutes coming up then I'm gonna get
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:45.880]  into other news issues like the economy a huge development Sarkozy takes G20 case
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:51.160]  to Obama as food prices soar his answer is again giving global government power
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.920]  and global taxation power to the G20 to control currency devaluation worldwide
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.200]  but you've got to read deeper into the article to understand that meanwhile the
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.080]  Southern Parvy Law Center and all these other groups will demonize you if you
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.840]  read the Reuters article and talk about the offshore owned Federal Reserve
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:15.320]  engaging in this with dollar devaluation you're not supposed to talk about it
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:22.880]  it's a conspiracy theory and if you do a psychopath fits the MO with the skulls
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.800]  and the death and the the loving abortion well that's a spin machine that
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.000]  within hours of this happening I've got the quotes here Keith Overman came in
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.640]  and said America put up your guns the you know the era of dangerous political
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.840]  rallies is over you mean where all these big union thugs are caught everywhere
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.960]  beating people up or the brown berets are beating people up if you dare come
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.200]  out on the fourth of July parade in LA you mean all those I mean I call it like
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.600]  I see it and for every Republican Rand Paul supporter that steps on somebody's
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.720]  head I can show you 10 15 20 examples of lunatic communist Democrat supporters
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.480]  who righteously are running around beating up people because they heard if
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:15.040]  you don't like big government you hate black people and so now we learn the
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:20.040]  bombshell research of Matt Ryan that integrates him of this Reuters article
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.800]  Arizona suspect had made death threats the sheriff who's busy blaming Rush
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.480]  Limbaugh said and you can say what you want about Rush Limbaugh I don't like
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.920]  the fact that he supports hardcore drug penalties but then has caught himself
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:39.040]  with synthetic heroin oxy cotton but that isn't the issue here Rush Limbaugh
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.880]  contributed nothing to this schizophrenic nut cake Sarah Palin nothing this guy
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.640]  was out of his mind obsessed with this woman did have some white supremacist
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.000]  leanings it looks like he was into everything scary and frightening I
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.840]  think I saw what an Atlantic story and a salon story that got it right he
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:09.280]  was a schizophrenic nut who was in anything he saw as scary and ominous so I
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:16.600]  guess you could blame the whole world for this I can't believe there's a
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.520]  Tucson publication linking linking me to it because of I'm in the movie
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:29.120]  Waking Life but again that's this this childlike Soviet culture of where one
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:35.300]  person does something wrong we've got to punish everybody else that's not the
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:40.640]  telltale signs of a free society okay now we're gonna go to break here in a

[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.800]  what we have here is a clear case of shelf-fulfilling prophecy the national
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:41.240]  and local media knew exactly what they were doing they hyped to a pool of 30
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:47.840]  million they hyped to a pool of 300 million Americans over and over and
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:58.080]  over again that a deranged tea partier is going to gun down politicians then a
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:04.880]  highly suggestible paranoid schizophrenic acts on the hype and the media
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:11.840]  instantly blames the tea party if they continue to hype this it will cause more
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:18.080]  deranged copycats to act and they knew exactly what they were doing in fact add
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:23.680]  to that Matt Ryan of course that's what they were counting on all along after
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:30.560]  all their media experts they understand psychology after all that's what they
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:37.880]  were planning all along they understand how to manipulate the human mind that's
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:43.720]  their specialty but once you're aware of their propaganda tactics it doesn't
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:49.160]  work anymore again liberal media was already prepared for violence in Tucson
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:55.040]  editors note from Alex Jones what we have here is a clear case of a self-fulfilling
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.120]  prophecy and this was done premeditatedly they knew exactly what they were
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.320]  doing the national and local media knew exactly what they were doing they hyped
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:11.800]  to a pool of more the census now says were 310 million Americans over and
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.080]  over and over again that a deranged tea partier was going to gun politicians
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:25.320]  down then a highly suggestible paranoid schizophrenic act on the hype and the
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.240]  media instantly blames the tea party if they continue to hype this it will cause
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:37.960]  more deranged copycats to act now how do we know this if you go back to pre 1990
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.680]  suicide numbers in high schools and junior highs it was much much much lower
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.600]  you can pull up the national news stories on this in the graphs but
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.040]  everybody knows they hyped the fact that suicides way up and it just gets
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.760]  worse and worse every year it never gets better and the more they hype that it's
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.120]  a problem and the more they have meetings and the more they have parents
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.880]  come to the auditorium and meet with their you know 11 and 12 year old
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.680]  daughters and sons and and the more they have workshops about don't hang
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.800]  yourself with your shoelaces like this don't take all the pills in the cupboard
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.640]  the more children that would be thinking about playing in the creek or playing
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.360]  football or playing Barbie the more these little innocent children who would
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.600]  never think about suicide who would never think about such things they're
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.000]  taught don't do this in fact I mean you see this all the time in places like
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.240]  New York and Chicago the police whenever they do have a jumper climb up over the
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.840]  barricades they have to stop them and jump off of the Empire State Building or
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:41.120]  the World Trade Centers before they were gone or the Sears Tower that always
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.240]  right after somebody does jump suddenly other people show up within hours or
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.960]  days and try so they station cops right there to stop people I mean this is
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:58.000]  basic psychology they know exactly what they're doing think about it and it's
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.800]  the same thing here now we know from all of his friends that he was extremely
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.400]  suicidal that he was completely paranoid and thought all his friends were out to
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.320]  getting he was a complete schizophrenic he thought he was being mind controlled
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.520]  maybe he was I don't know the point is he was nuts whether he was bent that way
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.560]  or whether it just happened because of genetics or upbringing or chemicals who
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:27.320]  knows and now we learn on local news over and over and over again they would
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:35.720]  interview representative Congresswoman Giffords over and over and over again
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.360]  and say are you worried about the crosshairs are you worried about the
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.800]  Sarah Palin people are you worried they're gonna kill you are you worried
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:47.000]  are you worried they're coming and they had other national news constantly look
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.240]  at these gun rallies where they're openly carrying they're gonna kill
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.440]  some politicians look they're spitting on the black members of Congress there's
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.000]  gonna be violence you mark my words they're gonna blow people away you watch
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.120]  it you got all these conservative people that love the Second Amendment so much
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.040]  even if they wanted to they'd never use a gun to kill somebody unless it was in
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.240]  self-defense because they don't want you to be able to demonize the Second
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.520]  Amendment they're out there openly carrying their guns because they're
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.960]  tired of getting SWAT team when the carpet cleaner sees a gun case in their
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.240]  house and thinks guns are illegal even in your own home they're openly
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.200]  exercising the Second Amendment to regain it because even though we have these
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.160]  rights a lot of people live in lawland and believe every place in the US is
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.640]  based in New York City from all these TV shows and that you go to jail if you
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.600]  have a gun and so they hyped this and hyped it and hyped it and there he was
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.040]  already obsessed with her already three years ago when he was described as a
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.280]  complete you know liberal by all his friends he was already obsessed with her
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.840]  and then you had all these publications daily costs and others say she's dead to
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.760]  me she's a sellout she's a problem she needs to be dealt with and you add all
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:01.360]  of this together here comes the nutcase and now they're hyping it again now
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.320]  they're pushing it and they're pushing that more of this is gonna happen and so
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.440]  more suicidal people instead of going and waving a gun around in public waiting
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.480]  for cops to come shoot them because they don't have the nerve to pull the
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:21.920]  trigger on themselves it gives them the idea no no no no you don't commit
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.760]  suicide yourself you don't just have cops do it for you suicide by cop you go
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:33.240]  and you shoot people in fact you don't just go shoot people at a McDonald's or
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.320]  at a shopping mall because that gets you a lot of attention which you also crave
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.520]  when you die because nobody ever gave you any attention because you were so
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.480]  creepy you know you could never get a girlfriend or get a date so you're
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:59.000]  completely upset with yourself no no now the media says you go to an event and
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.880]  you kill people isn't that just special and it's the same situation with the
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.760]  with the suicide education they've had since 1990 with federal grants nationwide
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.080]  everywhere they have it they've even got comparisons we've had sociologists and
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:21.040]  folks on to break this down they'll have counties and regions where they don't
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.960]  have suicide education they'll have much lower levels but then the counties where
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.640]  they do have much higher levels and now you turn on Nickelodeon I can even let
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.240]  my kids watch television it's all about don't commit suicide here's how you do
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:39.920]  it a turn on MTV abortion so cool next kids that commit suicide and then they
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.840]  have other TV ads for kids showing kids being murdered who don't accept the
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.600]  carbon taxes they know exactly what they're doing they're selling a culture
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:52.560]  of death where you hate yourself where you're nihilistic where you won't stand
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.280]  up for yourself and they know exactly what they're doing this article is very
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:02.480]  important liberal media was already prepared for violence in Tucson they
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.640]  they knew this was the guy who was after her we're now learning they were
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.640]  waiting they were watching they understood the different ingredients they
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.840]  were adding into this pot and within minutes they blamed their enemy people
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.840]  that don't want a private fellow reserve did you notice the talking points
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:25.920]  whether it was me a democracy now or MSNBC or CNN it's there are people who
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.640]  don't like the Federal Reserve and believe in a conspiracy that it's
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.240]  private and a conspiracy that we should have actual gold or silver backing up
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.520]  our currency it's not a conspiracy it's in the Constitution it's not a
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.800]  conspiracy it's how the country was founded it's not a conspiracy it's what
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:48.000]  we had up until Nixon got us off of it but they don't care no they could care
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.560]  less ladies and gentlemen they could care less they know exactly what they're
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.880]  doing they're out there saying hey there's crazy conspiracy theorists that
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.400]  don't like the Federal Reserve it's their fault this happened and that's
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.440]  showing you who the political power structures enemy is people who recognize
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.200]  who the shadow government is but you guys can read your own Gallup poll I
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.960]  mean surely you know depending on the poll it's 75 to 85 or even higher that
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.680]  want to abolish the Fed and know it's the problem I mean game over stage all

[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:30.120]  little girls either through mind control through the television or actual
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.560]  physical mind control but you're gonna do what you're gonna do we're gonna be
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.200]  here exposing you and of course you've also raised your ugly head and let us

[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.920]  the talking points want us to shut up about that Federal Reserve who's
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.640]  butchering our economy and who's stolen tens of trillions and won't tell cars
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.540]  where the money went and Ron Paul's now the head of the committee over the
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:00.080]  Federal Reserve you're panicking a federal judge just ordered the private

[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:39.440]  air worldwide hey hi Alex gonna talk to you recall this from in Italy I'm from
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.640]  actually a small town of an afro in southern Italy well good to have you
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:50.120]  Alex yeah what's on your mind today Rinaldo well you know pretty much Alex
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:55.560]  this is a global problem you know I mean and it's incredibly serious has been
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:00.000]  with us like for it for an incredible for an incredible long time I mean you
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.600]  know this story right you know the conspiracies I mean you know you know
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.840]  the entire you know Egypt right the woman like this problem has followed us
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:14.080]  throughout human civilization you know it has I mean I mean there's always been
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:18.240]  the problem of secret guilds of people that know what makes humans tick
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:23.120]  suppressing that knowledge and using it to dominate and control basically for
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.920]  thousands of years we've been under bondage of one form or another because
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.240]  the elites have learned basic psychology sociology anthropology and they've
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.840]  learned what makes us operate and then we're not taught that there's even this
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.040]  manipulation going on but as soon as you're aware of it just like as soon as
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.200]  you're aware of the private Federal Reserve no amount of brainwashing works
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.280]  anymore like you know it's like Thomas Edison imagine him you know like he
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:54.160]  just discovered the light bulb you know all of a sudden like wow that's that
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.520]  powerful you understand it's knowledge right it is and then we learn that the
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:06.440]  Greeks and the Romans and the Chinese more than 2,000 years ago 2,000 or so
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:13.280]  with the Greeks it's about 2,400 with the Greeks it was pre-Roman those groups
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.280]  there were found to have batteries about 2,500 years ago as well and also the
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.680]  Chinese right around the same time they had batteries back then it appears they
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.240]  had some type of filament systems as well for igniting something similar to a
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.920]  light bulb so we're told Thomas Edison invented all of this it turns out he
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.360]  didn't yeah well you know that it's the same thing with this promise that we
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.360]  have with you know with the new world order I mean reality you know we have
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.720]  not discovered anything new I mean he was already you know how the authority has
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.720]  always been there we have we are just unveiling it the others did for the
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.800]  first time probably you know yes sir I mean it's just like Plato's analogy or
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:59.800]  allegory of the cave where the people are in the cave watching projections from
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:06.200]  the firelight and they believe that the the shadows of the puppets is the
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.200]  reality instead of what's going on outside the cave and they will fight to
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:18.000]  defend that illusion exactly I mean Alex Plato Plato or he knew it he knew it
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.120]  he understood it you know we are talking about 200 200 years before Christ I mean
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:29.160]  it's incredible you know I'm but for the first time you know like me and you we
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:35.160]  can talk across the ocean you know absolutely and it's that technology
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.080]  Ronaldo bringing us together that's what scares the system Ronaldo is there in a
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.400]  awakening happening to the new world order in Italy it is it is Alex but it's
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:50.360]  very it's very subtle like it is it's subtle and it's I'm unfortunately like
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:56.720]  and I this is disgusting for me to say it but you know we were both corny you
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.920]  know but was corny situation in Italy is very very
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:06.040]  routine you know it's almost like a cultural behavioral you know psychological
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:13.480]  anchor that the times don't want to give up you know well yeah a lot of times
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.360]  corrupt politicians if they're flamboyant the people actually buy into
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:25.240]  associating their personal identity with that person and they actually like
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.560]  their servitude that's exactly what we have here with the love affairs we have
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:34.560]  with Barack Obama or George W. Bush but more and more that's changing I've just
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:39.840]  seen reports of record numbers of Italians not paying their taxes now well
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.280]  you know Alex this is I mean that's pretty much the norm in Italy yet you
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.400]  know this is why we have such this is why we have so high tax rates because
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:55.200]  really nobody nobody pays taxes you know we know we we just we we we have to
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:04.560]  invent all kind of you know situations and you know contracts to avoid due to a
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.280]  huge taxes and so to speak in closing what do you think of this shooter and
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:15.400]  the media we now learn hyping up that somebody was gonna shoot Giffords before
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.920]  it happened well you know it's the same thing that happened with Berlusconi
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.400]  about a year ago when he was hit by like a Milan dome such wet it was about like
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.960]  a year yeah it was like a year a month ago pretty much and you know like we
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.280]  know it was all fake you know in Italy Milan absolutely good to hear from you
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:40.840]  Ronaldo more calls I promise we'll get to everybody a full hour of calls and
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.840]  news coming up after David Ike leaves us in about 30 minutes we will get to you
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.920]  straight ahead but we've got to talk about this attempted frame up of the
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:55.440]  media on the other side we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:59.640]  and the GCN radio network
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.600]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:09.560]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.800]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.240]  the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse gold and silver haven't
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:21.360]  heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in

[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:24.040]  last hour we played the clip of the demonization of David I they called him
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:27.920]  an extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist I mean I'd have to if you were
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:32.200]  using mainstream terms for David Ike I don't think these terms are accurate but
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.720]  that's what if I was mainstream I'm calling kind of a liberal new age guy
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:42.320]  you know consciousness waking up you know I mean a lot of those same tenants
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:47.400]  just incredible I mean I know when I first read his book 16 17 years ago it
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.160]  was in the new age section of the bookstore to put it to you that way I
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.360]  mean this is a peace love non-violence guy but about waking up why would the
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:00.720]  Southern Power Law Center attack I ran and then David Ike in the same piece
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:07.040]  why are they now coming out against yours truly and Ron Paul pretty wild and
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.640]  why is Satanism always attached always attached to these killers to these mass
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.800]  murderers of these lone assassins I mean over and over again the psychopaths the

[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.520]  guy had it and how is that Rush Limbaugh's fault well they're calling for the
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:29.040]  fairness doctrine where you can't have political views you just got to repeat
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.200]  basically what the government press releases say we're going to David Ike the
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.120]  conspiracy theorist icon the mainstream media would call him now a right-wing
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.200]  extremist but before we do that I want to tell you about inner food it's

[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:53.520]  now going to David Ike we're gonna play this clip again it's it's it's it's very
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.880]  short I'm sure David's seen it but I haven't asked him but but here's one of
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.640]  the clips this is a couple hours after the shooting Saturday and they talk
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:06.600]  about I ran they talk about another author and then they go after David Ike
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.640]  for conscious dreaming which I haven't really heard David talk much about now
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.720]  they're blaming me for the conscious dreaming because I'm in the film waking
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:19.080]  life a Richard Linkler film that is about that I mean this is crazy now if you
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:23.000]  talk about daydreaming you're now going to cause mass murder let's go ahead and
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.840]  play that clip this man also talk quite a lot in these strange videos of his
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.480]  about what he called conscious dreaming but I think is almost certainly meant
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.840]  to be conscious streaming which is an idea that also has been kind of tossed
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:43.080]  around of the radical right in particular by a kind of British conspiracy
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.600]  theorist by the name of David Ike so a lot of these ideas his burning of the
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.720]  flag his talking about the government his treasonous and using mind control
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.960]  okay that's enough no he was talking in class about could he be under mind control
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.080]  David Ike and we now learned that they knew he was death-threading people and
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:06.320]  we're doing nothing that's Reuters we now know the media kept asking Giffords
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:09.920]  over and over again nationally and locally is somebody gonna kill you is
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:14.520]  somebody gonna get you pretty much triggering this guy they can program
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.080]  people who are unstable now through the television they don't even need to grab
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.560]  you you're an expert in this mind control David and they're now coming after
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.560]  you let's get into what you think of this shooting and all the rest of it well
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:33.360]  the fact that they're coming up coming after me is it makes me delighted because
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:39.360]  if I'm rattling their cage then I'm doing something right the whole scenario
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:47.560]  is ludicrous but perfectly predictable because we've reached a point now where
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:54.920]  they are so desperate to push this agenda forward as fast as possible before
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:01.400]  the wake-up that's happening gets to a point where it brings it to an end but
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:05.920]  the excuses now are getting more and more ludicrous they're not even paying
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:12.520]  lip service to any even fake substance someone burns his bum on some small
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.800]  little device on a plane and suddenly everyone's getting radiated every day in
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.280]  America in full-body scanners thanks to people like Michael Shirtoff former head
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.520]  of Homeland Security and co-author of the Patriot Act and now we have this
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:33.960]  situation where either one of the two a guy who became mentally ill and mentally
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:38.840]  deranged from some sort of natural process or quite possibly it's happening
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:45.320]  on an incredible scale a manipulated implanted process it goes crazy with a
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:51.600]  gun and immediately on the queue just like when 9-11 happened they were
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:57.360]  talking about bin Laden immediately the the the next stage of the whole thing
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:05.440]  unfolds where they're using it and I have to say I am so utterly disgusted and
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:13.680]  repulsed but these people can have such be so shameless to have no heart no
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:21.000]  compassion no sense of decency that they can use an horrific event involving the
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.360]  death of a nine-year-old child among many others to to you to push their
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:34.320]  political agenda to defame and try to discredit those that are uncovering the
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:41.200]  very cabal that controls them it turns my stomach it makes me puke this is the
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:48.680]  level of soulless compassionate lack of empathy that we're dealing with with the
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:54.320]  people that are pushing this agenda now it is just just horrific to see this
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.400]  unfolding now you've written extensively in the last 17 18 years about
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:05.120]  Satanism and why we see it at skull and bones Bohemian Grove why we see it
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.360]  involved with almost every serial killer especially those that go after
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.960]  children altars I called him as a Satanist instantly when I started
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:21.280]  reading about it Saturday but on air Sunday then Monday morning yesterday the
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.800]  Newark Daily News and others had somebody sneak in his backyard there was a
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.360]  full bore tent on altar the family obviously knew about it there described
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.760]  as the Adams family by locals now their house is boarded up I think the whole
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.720]  group needs to be investigated but over and over again you've done deep research
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:44.840]  on this there is extreme Satanism but as you've proven it's used as a template
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:53.280]  for mind control and and former FBI LA division directors that we've had on this
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:00.560]  show I have gone over that as well I mean what's going on with this Satanism
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:06.640]  well you know I've written and talked about extensively not least recently the
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:13.600]  the three points of the monster if you like in terms of this area that we're
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:19.560]  talking about our Satanism mind control and secret societies and
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:26.240]  pedophilia and those all work as one unit it's not saying every Freemason's a
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.480]  Satanist every Satanist the Freemason the Freemason's a pedophile every
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:35.080]  pedophile is a Satanist but there is a massive connection between them not
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:41.640]  least in the way they use techniques not only Alex to mind control people and
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:46.200]  get them to act react and perceive in the way that they're programmed to but
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:52.600]  also and we've talked about this before it's about getting people possessed by
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:58.600]  very malevolent entities that's what Satanism and Satanic ritual and
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:05.280]  manipulation is overwhelmingly about it's about putting another malevolent
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:13.160]  consciousness in control of that person's body so it reacts and behaves in line
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:18.160]  with with that malevolent entity it's no accident mate that they've been talking
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:25.000]  about possession for hundreds and thousands of years in every culture
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.080]  and they're still talking about it today and if you look at Loeffner you can't
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:32.960]  fake that I mean he looks like he's demon possessed and for those that are
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.880]  atheist or whatever even if you don't believe this stuff notice that atheism
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:45.520]  in many cases in his case then leads to this occult voodoo with a skull and the
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:49.160]  oranges and the altar that's what that is ladies and gentlemen and what is
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:54.760]  voodoo voodoo is possession by the spirits and he was there wanting to be
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:58.280]  possessed and I've researched voodoo that's what that ritual is with a skull
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:04.840]  by the top hat wearing skull or the devil in voodoo he was asking to be
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:08.920]  possessed by the devil that's basic criminology and the key here is the
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.960]  globalist believe in this when I infiltrated Bohemian Grove they asked
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.760]  for the spirits of old grovers to be there they asked for the spirit of
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:23.640]  Mollick to enter them on videotape I mean even if you don't believe in spirits
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.880]  folks these people do David Ike well the fact is and I've talked to former
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:36.080]  Satanists all over the world over the last 20 years in my research of this the
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:42.840]  hierarchy of Satanism is dictated by the power of the demons that possess you
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:48.520]  that's why Satan is seeking more and more power and more and more status
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:53.200]  within these networks are constantly seeking more and more powerful demonic
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:58.440]  entities to take them over that's why some of the most demonically possessed
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:03.640]  people end up in the positions within the conspiracy within politics and
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:09.240]  banking and business and the military and all these things media and and
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:16.280]  therefore it's no accident that all those operations working as one unit treat
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:23.160]  the world and control the world with such lack of empathy lack of decency
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:28.160]  lack of soul lack of compassion and it's everything is is what is best for them
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.640]  and the consequences for others are irrelevant but there's another aspect of
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:37.680]  this which has to be spoken about if we're going to understand the Southern
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:44.160]  Poverty Law Center it works with a network of organizations like the
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.320]  Anti-Defamation League and Abe Foxman the Simon visa to our center the American
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.720]  Jewish Committee and others and it's a network which is designed and it answers
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:47:00.000]  ultimately to the House of Rothschild designed to target anyone who gets too
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.360]  close to the truth about the conspiracy to dub them racist to dub them right
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:11.160]  wing to dub them terrorists and potentially violent and this is what's
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:16.520]  happening now the Southern Poverty Law Center I mean where the hell the poverty
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:22.400]  comes from Alex I don't know it's got assets of 200 million dollars Mark
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:28.400]  Potok this guy Potok whatever his name is 144 thousand dollars a year but the
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:35.600]  president the CAO Richard Cowan 350 one thousand dollars a year on it goes and on it goes it's a
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.760]  money-making organization which like the defamation league something like 50
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:46.200]  million dollars a year in fundraising it uses fear and it uses the threat of the
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:51.800]  far right to get people to fund it to enormous amounts of money and to keep
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:57.040]  that funding going and also to do the job its masters put these on and they
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.080]  train the police and then they train the police people and jump anyone getting
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.960]  close to the truth as far right and all the rest of it that was been coming out
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:11.520]  since this terrible event in Arizona but I mean now they're attacking you
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:17.080]  I'm Rand I mean I mean what's so threatening about I'm ran well what's
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.800]  threatening about anybody Alex is if they're getting close to uncovering the
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:27.360]  truth and it is no accident whatsoever but they've turned their attention to me
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:34.000]  these groups had had had me in their sights back in the 90s when they were
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.040]  trying to get venues to ban me from speaking and succeeded in places like
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:42.560]  Canada but because what they were saying about me and what I say probably what I
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:48.800]  write what I stand for so ludicrously different and opposed it didn't stick
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.360]  and this one's sticking there is desperation but it's no accident that
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:58.960]  on New Year's Day I put out a major major expose the article across the
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:02.720]  internet you can get on my website it's called they dare not speak its name
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:08.680]  Rothschild Zionism pointing out that Zionism is not about the benefit
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:14.000]  benefiting Jewish people it's on its play out level it's only a political
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.480]  philosophy but the key point Alex is at its core it is a secret society created
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:24.600]  by the Rothschilds controlled by the Rothschilds and it's there for the
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.600]  benefit not of Jewish people many of whom incidentally fundamentally opposed
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:36.720]  Zionism or Rothschild Zionism as I call it it's there to serve the Rothschild
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:42.080]  Illuminati Rockefeller subordinates to the Rothschilds agenda and therefore
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:49.200]  these organizations have seen that where I show the staggering ratio of
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:54.080]  Rothschild Zionist agency government in key positions before during and after
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.720]  9-11 etc and suddenly that goes out and bingo they start turning their
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:03.920]  attentions on me through the Southern Poverty Law Center I'm delighted because
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.240]  it means it's having an effect and if they think they're gonna shut me up
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:11.480]  well they can they can try for the rest of their lives it ain't gonna happen we
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:16.520]  have to stand up to these people and we have to open our eyes to some of the
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:21.360]  agendas and the people behind them and what's really going on all these
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.040]  organizations Alex the Alex anti-deformation League Southern Poverty
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.600]  Law Center Simon Wiesenthal Center they all say they human rights organizations
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:36.320]  when they are taking away human rights and even helping to write legislation to
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:40.240]  take away basic human rights the anti-deformation League actually makes
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:46.640]  its money and also does its business by defaming people it's all
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.960]  really no I know they're constantly they're constantly attacking yours truly
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.520]  we got to go to break they will come back and continue along this line and get
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:51:01.320]  back also into the mass shooting and where you see this going hi this is
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.240]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds

[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:12.800]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's

[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:20.160]  possible that could even happen again so our friends and solutions from science

[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.640]  Alright, we've only got David for this segment and the next, but I wanted to get him on
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:16.920]  because I did see his report on the pre-speech attack machine of the Rothschilds
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:20.840]  and that really is who's financing and I've done the research. And then you say
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.840]  please don't lie about me, please don't attack me. It's like oh you must be
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:29.520]  racist. And again this has all been laid out, but these groups have gone too far
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.280]  because now if you don't want government-run healthcare and death
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.440]  panels, they say oh you don't like black people. I mean it just doesn't work
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.680]  anymore. And I want to get back into that, David, the time we have with you
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:44.520]  because we were having an interesting discussion during the break about Lou
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:48.600]  Dobbs and other issues that I was aware of. And then now Ventura show, having some
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:53.160]  of the episodes pressured off air and that's Homeland Security and ADL and
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:56.720]  others. I can tell folks, but I've been asked not to get into all the details.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.960]  The problem is you know once you're in people's confidence you have to agree as
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.960]  a journalist to not get into all the areas if they ask you not to and
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:08.960]  that's their decision. But when you were talking about world leaders being into
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.160]  the occult and Satanism, it doesn't end with Ronald Reagan's wife being into
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:18.080]  astrology and all decisions being made on that. That's kind of the doorstep. Look
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.000]  at mainstream news with the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair being
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.320]  possessed every morning by a quote spirit and flopping around the ground and
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:32.720]  going to juridic sites and doing rituals. His wife being called a witch, is a
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:37.600]  witch. The head of the Church of England now a druid priest. We have Francois
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:42.720]  Mitterrand who built the 666 piece pyramid and admitted Luciferian. I mean
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:47.600]  this stuff is not hidden. Well no, but also you know we've got to be careful that
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:52.520]  you know knowledge is knowledge. Knowledge and awareness is not good or bad it
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:58.040]  just is. It's the use of it and therefore astrology is a science. I mean we
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:01.280]  won't do it now. I'll probably never do it on this show but I could talk for a
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.080]  long time about astrology and how it works and why it is. It's how you use
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:11.360]  things and it's how you use this knowledge and they use it in a very
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.320]  very negative way. They understand, I mean the people on the inside, how the
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:21.600]  psyche works, what the human body is, what the basic nature of this reality is
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.080]  and therefore they use that knowledge to manipulate the people and the minds of
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:31.280]  the people and the perceptions of the people even an individual target for
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:37.800]  some particular event and horror or the people on mass and they do it but by
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.120]  having that knowledge and keeping that knowledge systematically from the public
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:47.840]  arena where the people can have some access of understanding of themselves,
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.200]  their reality and how it's being manipulated and therefore not only is
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:59.400]  it dangerous from these people's point of view to put out information about the
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:04.920]  banking scam and the financial scam and the global warming scam and all these
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:09.640]  other things that absolutely need to get out there, they are terrified of the
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:15.640]  nature of reality coming out as well and so they target people like me, not
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.320]  just for putting the conspiracy stuff out which I do of course I like you all
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:25.960]  the time but the other stuff and it's information, what they've created is an
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:31.520]  information bubble to keep the people in ignorance of so much including the
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:36.560]  nature of their own self and the anyone who is threatening to burst that bubble
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.480]  which more and more people are now means they have to get more and more
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:45.320]  desperate and that's what we think and more and more ludicrous in the way they
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.880]  try to discredit, stop, block those people who are threatening the bubble.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:54.720]  Well look at how the ADL Southern Primary Law style folks going after Lou
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:59.400]  Dobbs who's a great guy look I mean I mean this is not the civil rights or
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:03.400]  human rights I mean these groups really are at the forefront of trying to shut
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:07.800]  down free speech they want the fairness doctrine again and people need to stand
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.600]  up and say no. Exactly what we need to do is realize because it's not difficult
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:17.120]  it's blatantly in our face that these people have no interest in human rights
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.960]  they have an interest in destroying them they have no interest in freedom of
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:24.560]  expression or freedom of any kind they have an interest in destroying it because
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:28.720]  the masters that they serve want to destroy it that's the reason that they're
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.440]  doing all this stuff so with their targeting people it means that the
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:36.960]  people must be saying something right. Stay there David five more minutes
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.640]  with you we got a 60-second break then it's your phone call stay with us.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:46.960]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade we
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:53.080]  are the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:57.360]  consider buying a solar power generator. Number one new climate legislation
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:00.720]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two our new
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:04.640]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.840]  to have. It's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:13.280]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three in some areas of the country the
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:18.040]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:21.840]  compounding the problem. Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.440]  local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:29.800]  related onages. Number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:32.960]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:36.640]  generators offered by Solutions from Science one of my oldest sponsors. You

[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:12.720]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.

[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:34.880]  Our final segment David I've really have him on for roughly a half hour your
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:41.120]  calls directly I promise call after call coming up in the next segment but
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:46.000]  David was getting into censorship and it is the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:52.800]  other groups that you'll claim oh you know they're fighting the Ku Klux Klan
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:57.680]  and then next they're saying by the way you shouldn't criticize health care
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:01.360]  you're a racist if you do or or David Ike talks about expanding your
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:06.320]  consciousness that's extreme right wingism I mean this is crazy but but they
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:09.280]  know exactly what they're doing and they're now moving to restrict free
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:13.120]  speech to bring in the fairness doctrine and they are losing a lot of
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.320]  credibility and the globalist more and more scared and that was the point I
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:20.720]  wanted to get into with you David we were talking you know during the last
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:25.120]  segment and you agree with my view that there is an explosive awakening
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.280]  happening right now and that's why they're trying to move to start to start
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:34.560]  curtailing the web web taxes web IDs restrictions on speech all over the
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.440]  world the globalist are in trouble
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:43.840]  when a human rights organization allegedly tells you that they've got to take
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:47.680]  your freedoms and freedom of speech away well actually something's clearly
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.080]  blatantly wrong there are a bunch of liars there are a bunch of hypocrites
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:56.960]  and we've got the anti-deformation league that claims to be a human rights
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.040]  organization standing up for people's rights and all the rest of it
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:05.360]  back in the 90s it was exposed for having people working for it that were
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:09.280]  infiltrating what what what we would call today progressive groups
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.120]  infiltrating arab americans infiltrating native americans and
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:18.080]  infiltrating black americans police stations and stealing files
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.160]  passing information to the apartheid regime in south africa about them
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:25.600]  and must add this is the real anti-deformation league this is the
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:31.520]  real poverty law center absolute hypocrites and garbage
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.440]  i interrupted you to throw in that the the adl was actually convicted
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.520]  in california having breaking into police departments having spies
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:44.320]  getting police files on politicians uh... even people at front alex it's a
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:48.160]  moth at front in america just like a pack is and just like the
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.440]  simon vies and child center is this is a rough child
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:57.280]  sign it's fun and it's amazing to me that people like obama and all these
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:01.360]  moralizing people in the media these moralizing politicians
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:07.360]  these moralizing uh... pseudo uh... human rights people like mark potock
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:12.000]  they can uh... uh... can't get a microphone microphone quick enough when
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.120]  something like this happens at an horrific event like this
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:22.080]  but they uh... are quite okay with with with uh... mass murder by america and
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:27.440]  britain uh... governments and military of people in iraq of janistan pakistan
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:31.600]  year after year after year they're quite okay with american tax
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:35.600]  payers money being used to to uh... for the ongoing
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.000]  systematic genocide against palestinian people by the israeli government
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.480]  yes that's fine they're not against violence they're just using virus
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.000]  governments are violent they are based on violence
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.280]  violence is happening now against people being
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:55.200]  uh... foreclosed from their homes violence is being done now by
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:04:00.160]  by the uh... in possession of poverty upon people real poverty mr uh potock
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:04.160]  by the way by the banks and all these other things that are going on well
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:07.680]  david we're out of time but but uh... i want you to recap because that is on
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:12.080]  record that that the adl and others were passing stuff through israel
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.880]  to the apartheid regime that israel just loved
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:17.920]  you know that's the kind of stuff we're not supposed to talk about like when
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:21.520]  jimmy carter said that it's apartheid over there in the middle east
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:24.800]  everybody got so mad but israel worked with the apartheid regime
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:30.080]  including on race specific bio weapons yeah israel is an apartheid regime
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:33.920]  every bit as much as south africa was in every bit as what much as america
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:39.360]  uh... was uh... in the in the time of uh... the diversion of apartheid and it's
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:44.160]  not only an apartheid state in israel in regarding uh... the israelis and uh...
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.760]  and uh... the palestinians is an apartheid uh... regime
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.360]  even between different levels of uh... the israelis and jewish people
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.520]  the way they treat black jews in uh... from Ethiopia in israel
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:59.520]  is little better than vermin david hike amazing uh amazing
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:04.800]  we're out of time hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.640]  century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:11.440]  history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:14.480]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:18.560]  i've turned in members influence on our president in congress
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:23.280]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us

[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:32.480]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.760]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:39.680]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:43.440]  and the congress is saying who to make the checkout to today seems like nobody

[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:09.040]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:12.640]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:16.560]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:19.920]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses

[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:13.200]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:16.560]  okay we've had some real troopers that have been holding uh patiently we're
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.440]  going to get into some financial news coming up at the bottom of the hour
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:23.440]  and a bunch of other important news haven't gotten to yet but i do want to
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:27.440]  hear from callers there is of course a giant push going to restrict the first
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:31.760]  amendment uh the most brazen i've ever seen in the us calls for the fairness
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:35.680]  doctrine that's an orwellian term it's very unfair no more free speech on talk
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:38.880]  radio or tv uh right as the fcc you notice
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:43.280]  announces jurisdiction over the internet uh a month ago this uh right as the
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:46.240]  cyber security systems go online right as obama
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:50.640]  proposes internet ids tracking you i mean it's all happening
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:56.960]  and big calls for gun registration uh assault weapons bands it's on
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:00.480]  and if they keep having uh easily suggestible
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:06.640]  mind control wind up zombies uh like uh this latest uh loon uh shooting
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:09.600]  congresspeople you know the question is will they start
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:13.920]  enacting laws against the second amendment uh as an attempt
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:21.680]  uh to protect themselves and of course we wrote the story i'm at ryan did at
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:24.800]  info wars dot com it's also going up on present planet dot com
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:29.120]  liberal media was already prepared for violence in tucson editors note
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:33.920]  from alex jones what we have here is a clear case of a self-fulfilling
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.280]  prophecy the national and local media knew exactly
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:43.200]  what they were doing they hyped to a pool on national and local television of
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:46.720]  300 million americans over and over again that a deranged
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:52.160]  tea partier is going to gun politicians down
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:55.840]  then a highly suggestible paranoid schizophrenic
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.800]  acts on the hype and the media instantly blames the tea party
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:05.360]  if they continue to hype this it will cause more deranged copycats to act
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.360]  and that's the issue what did they do back in the 60s and 70s when we had some
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:12.560]  real terrorism in this country carried out by communist
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:15.920]  of course i call it real a lot of it was actually grassroots some of it was
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.000]  like patty herce and others turned out she was fbi that was all staged
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.840]  uh but you ignore and don't play up real terror
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:26.880]  or real events i mean it's on the news and then that's it and okay
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.280]  let's not milk this now though when they stage an event
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:36.000]  they hype it like i said last week looks like these firecracker attacks were
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.720]  probably a grassroots alone in maryland and the homeland security the
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:44.320]  governor uh napolitano but the governor maryland and
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:47.280]  napolitano had a homeless security you notice they're playing that down that's
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.760]  because generally real attacks from our research are played down
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.920]  but when they have engineered something like the underwear bomber
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:59.440]  or or that nutcase psychiatrist out at ford hood
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:02.880]  which we know was engineered that's hyped to the nines
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:06.480]  uh so let's go back to your phone calls here chuck ed
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:12.400]  jonathan joey mike and others uh chuck in north carolina you're on the air
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.920]  hey alex how you doing good um i think uh one of the biggest stories i don't
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:22.240]  think i've heard you cover it today is uh last night on glenn beck show he
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.200]  decided to say um nine well he he pulled us uh that nine
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:31.200]  eleven truthers are going to be dangerous to put it at the top of the list
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:36.320]  then he turned around to say that uh i'm not saying they're dangerous
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:39.840]  but obviously that's what this whole thing is going to come back to
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:43.680]  i think tonight we'll see obama um talk about um
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.840]  how uh it's a conspiracy thing left wing and right wing
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:52.400]  we'll both turn away from blaming each other and it's going to come back to
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:56.080]  um trying to make this guy out to be a truth or i don't know i agree in fact
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:59.520]  in fact that's what i've seen let's all come together because they couldn't
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:03.760]  blame limbaugh and uh others successfully let's all come
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:08.800]  together against the truthers because now one of his anonymous friends
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:11.760]  says that in passing he didn't believe the official story well
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:15.520]  we have a new york times angus and reid poll were 83 percent
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:20.960]  don't believe the official story other polls are 54 55 66 you know they run the
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:24.880]  gamut so uh they had an australian poll where 70 plus
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:29.200]  was a 76 percent when the poll closed believed inside job so see
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:34.640]  oh 9 11 people they murder children meanwhile the father and mother are
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:38.400]  saying don't use this for political control we don't like what the tsa is
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:41.120]  doing let's not have america lose more liberties like
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.080]  we did after 9 11 uh but i don't watch glenn beck i did
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:50.880]  see him a few months ago because again people tell us about us we went and
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.160]  pulled it up on youtube say the government is getting ready to
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:58.000]  stage a new oklahoma city to blame domestic groups
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.640]  and uh they've tried now whether this was staged or not to blame it on palin
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:05.520]  and limbaugh and i've seen him try to blame it on beck
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:08.480]  and fox news from saturday their tack was oh no
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:12.960]  it's not the left-winger right wing uh this guy was a conspiracy theorist
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.480]  before we heard the 9 11 stuff so they've been desperately interviewing the
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:21.120]  hundreds of classmates from college because was there 9 11 was there 9 11
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:26.080]  and beck has always said uh you know 9 11 truth is going to attack
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.360]  i mean i saw him years ago say we need to use the army against them
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:33.680]  why are they so scared of 9 11 truth show
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:36.960]  andrew napolitano his guest host his fill in host
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:40.320]  uh it has you know the top rated show on business network
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.560]  he said he didn't buy the official story herald rivera has now said that i mean
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:47.840]  it's just look at the facts i got the cops saying get back we're
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:50.880]  going to blow up building seven the cops were told they were going to blow it
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.200]  up they blow up a 47 story building i can't ignore it
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:00.000]  six of the ten commissioners say it's a fraud the evidence goes on and on and
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.520]  on and on and the homeland security admits 95
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:06.880]  percent of the funding is for domestic groups not
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:11.520]  muslim related even if you believe the muslims did it all
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.600]  by themselves which is ridiculous it doesn't matter homeland security is
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.400]  set up for the american people and they've been gearing up for
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:24.000]  these domestic actions and they've got mind control just via
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.520]  television down to such a science they know there's
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:31.200]  x many violent paranoid schizophrenics in a population
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:34.320]  they know there's x number on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.560]  that make them very very suggestible and they know they start hyping
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:42.720]  crosshairs are on you congresswoman uh giffords
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:45.360]  is somebody going to kill you i heard you're getting death threats are they
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:48.160]  going to kill you anytime now meanwhile this guy's making death threats and
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:51.920]  doesn't get in trouble meanwhile his parents know he's got a voodoo
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:55.920]  shrine in the backyard he's dread you know i mean come on
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:01.120]  come on i mean look the banks are imploding the economy we're going into
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.680]  world government they're taking our liberties they're getting ready to
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.960]  start censoring free speech and this stuff comes right on time
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:12.480]  is it don't let a good crisis go to waste like rama manual said
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:19.200]  look i started making a film about back this trojan
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:22.320]  horse and others have picked up on that term they're now making a trojan horse
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:26.000]  film i've seen a trailer for it and i decided to make it instead just about
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.960]  the overall neocons and how they operate with the liberals
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:33.680]  and how the things all interlocking and i get so busy doing other interviews and
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:37.440]  radio and tv you notice how hardly we make films these days
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:40.400]  was to interview after interview and put upon prison planet dot tv which is also
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:46.480]  highly effective uh i said i take your calls it's i don't
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.000]  want to get off in the back um
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.640]  i know that when the joe stacked guy flew his plane into the building
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.120]  reportedly uh beck was saying 9 11 truth or i mean he really
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:01.520]  really when the people learn the government's a lie when they learn
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:05.280]  there's all this fraud people went after hitler people went after
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:09.200]  chelchescu people went after stalling and linen
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:12.720]  i mean you know that's going to happen i'm not even saying it's good
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:16.400]  but the issue here is we're in crazy times and stuff's going to get crazy
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:20.000]  add in florida you're on the air alex can you hear me

[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:52.160]  few ones that are seen as more kooky like the mind
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:56.320]  control that aren't as strong i mean folks let me tell you that night when
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:59.200]  that show aired because i hadn't seen the whole episode i'd seen pieces of it when

[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:06.960]  believe you got that on air and he said i can't believe it got on either
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:12.080]  and i called tyrell i called braverman and braverman was like
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:14.720]  man there's major pressure getting put on because i don't want to get into it
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:17.280]  with you now and then i learned more from other people
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:22.000]  uh since then and now because the congressman shot his mouth off cohen
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.080]  i know some of the behind the scenes guys in suits breaking into things uh
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:31.680]  things being stolen and threats and uh show homeland security went directly to
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:35.120]  time warner and they just decided shut the whole
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:39.840]  thing down so we kept wondering how'd this get on air it
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:43.760]  the decision in certain quarters were made all let ventura do it
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:47.760]  you know no one will believe it it'll see they know that people are waking up so
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.200]  they know the market's so big the establishment's answer is okay let
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:55.920]  them go ahead and talk about it we have the power they'll never wake up
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:00.240]  but go ahead and cover it and then the show got top ratings
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:03.360]  on wednesday nights so they moved it to friday's hoping it would hurt the
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:06.640]  ratings that's the dead zone still got great ratings
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:10.560]  and now they're just killing it and i'll be surprised if the show comes back
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.080]  next year or if it does it's going to be i don't think

[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:32.400]  jonathan in kansas thank you for holding sir you're on the air worldwide on 111
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:42.560]  1111 so 111111 go ahead you're on the air alex um it's funny how this guy chip
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:50.640]  burley uh attacks uh us and uh people in the truth movement um it's interesting
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:56.400]  he cites uh the southern poverty law center and you know he goes on to say
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:03.440]  that oh it's partly anti-semitic but the any citing uh banter uh the defamation
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:09.280]  center or whatever and they they point out to iran who's jewish so which is it
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:14.240]  is it that they're with iran or that there's see the psychology is even more
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:19.440]  sophisticated the southern poverty law center has been caught not just
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:24.400]  infiltrating but heading up elaheem city where mcvay was at and others and so
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:34.000]  what happens is they inject anti-semitism that oh everything is anti-semitism to
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.440]  the point of people getting sick of hearing about it and then actually
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:43.440]  putting the idea into people's heads and then jews get persecuted and then that
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:47.920]  makes jews give even more money to the adl their southern poverty law center
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:54.320]  adl especially that's their model uh and so again it's basic psychology and the
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:58.800]  globalist no psychology that's why they're so hard to beat but being aware of
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:02.720]  the tricks uh is how it operates but basically you don't like government
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:06.000]  health care you don't like the private
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.520]  federal reserve you don't like people trying to take your guns in private
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.920]  property you are a nazi or you hate black people
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:18.320]  and it's just cold-bloodily used as a political
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:21.520]  weapon and then people politically correctly just go okay i'll do whatever
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:24.960]  you say i'll keep my mouth shut please don't call me racist
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:28.640]  but the good news is people are sick of hearing about it they're tired of it
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:32.480]  they see through it uh and then the government goes out and funds the more
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:36.400]  radical white supremacist groups and others to make them look extremely
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:40.720]  crazy and dangerous so that there can then be calls for more restrictions on
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:44.080]  free speech i mean they figured this out i mean just
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:48.080]  like the government had howl turner running around calling for violence for
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:52.960]  more than a decade and he was a protege along with
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:57.040]  fox news host john hannity uh it turned out he was the highest level national
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:01.920]  security asset uh but really good points jonathan anything else
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:06.080]  yes also notice how chip burley um yeah
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:11.360]  amy goodman keeps asking that it's asking him if he has evidence and keeps
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:14.400]  speculating which is interesting considering that
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:19.280]  he's uh theorizing of a right wing conspiracy while attacking conspiracy
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:23.440]  theories well i mean david ike is anything but
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:26.560]  right wing i mean he goes to africa with medicine men
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:31.200]  and sits there in like long dances and rituals crying his eyes out i mean let
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:33.840]  me tell you david ike's effective because you can
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:37.120]  you believe all of what he says or 95 percent or none of it
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.200]  but the guy is for real he really believes what he's saying
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:47.040]  believe me uh you know award-winning uh
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:50.560]  oscar winning best actors can't i mean i've seen videos of
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:54.480]  ike just bawling you know when he's how much he loves the african
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:58.560]  people uh and you know all the rest of it i mean i mean he if anything he's a
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:01.360]  real bleeding heart and they're calling him a far
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:05.040]  right wing guy i mean it's just it's it's it's
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:11.520]  asinine i appreciate your call jonathan uh joey in jersey you're on the air
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:15.600]  hey hey buddy how are you i'm good
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:18.640]  all right i got a question here i want your opinion on this
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:22.720]  with the splc coming out and blaming david david ike first
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:27.440]  rather with me i would take you and him down first like with alice jones and
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:31.360]  with uh david ike why would they push him more under the
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.760]  bus first rather than yourself because the way i would look at it like i would
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:38.560]  go and tack you first before david ike with him talking
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:42.000]  about the reptilian race and everything and it's just really confusing and you
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.080]  have to take a step back well i think that uh
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.720]  i think that uh potok was saying that because he could make a connection to
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:55.440]  ike because the guy talked about uh conscious dreaming
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:58.800]  uh which i guess ike has talked about some but so
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:01.920]  a lot of other people so i think that's why
[02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:06.160]  uh and the guy talked about the individual against the world
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:09.920]  which a lot of you know crazies have not just people that are into liberty
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:12.880]  uh and so they were trying to make whatever connections they could i mean
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:15.440]  i instantly before the media even picked up on it
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:19.200]  i said didn't palin put cross arizona districts and i
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:23.360]  didn't remember arizona being one of the big ones and sure you know we put that
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:26.640]  in an article we said will the media go with this and sure enough they were
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:29.760]  by the time we got an article out they were doing the same thing
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:33.280]  but but we were just looking at who would they blame so it was whoever they
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.480]  could make tenuous connections to this sheriff
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:40.880]  isn't a lot of trouble because he had nothing to link limbaugh
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:44.720]  i mean limbaugh is pretty milk toast he's certainly not calling for violence
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:48.000]  uh so it's just like oklahoma city when they blame limbaugh
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:51.200]  i mean they're basically blaming anybody and everybody they don't like
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:55.040]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:59.840]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:04.720]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over
[02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:09.920]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:12.800]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and
[02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:16.400]  government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:20.480]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected

[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:55.120]  modification a half bear half man by uh the 12
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:58.720]  uh yeah there is a lot of crazy stuff even in
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:03.440]  azekiel and in genesis with the genetic mixing and
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:06.800]  humans being mixed by these weird people flying around and
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:11.360]  big ships i mean i challenge folks to uh go actually read the bible for
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:14.400]  yourself it's some pretty interesting stuff in it
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:17.360]  uh but you know i really don't get into all of that i just get into what i can
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:21.280]  absolutely document that's happening right now you know i tell the public
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:25.600]  for 20 years they've had part spider part goat creatures
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:29.200]  and i get letters all the time and i'm a stinking liar they won't search the
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:33.120]  term spider goats or that they've got a mouse with a human brain
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:35.920]  or that they've that we've got on our dinner table
[02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:39.520]  the scores of different uh so-called uh
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.040]  plants that grow their own pesticides in them that we're eating
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:46.960]  and that attack our liver and and cause all sorts of problems and
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:50.960]  it's it i can't get folks to admit what's real you know much less what
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:54.640]  speculation very interesting mic uh tom in florida you're on the air moving
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:57.120]  quick here go ahead tom hey alex how you doing
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:03.280]  hey buddy hey um i was on paxel um for about a year in 99 and 2000 i just
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:05.680]  want to tell you everything you're saying about the effects of that is
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:10.800]  100 correct it was crazy alex i mean literally the first month
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:14.880]  i was on this stuff all i thought about doing was killing myself
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.800]  like non-stop and back in 99 paxel was a relatively new drug and um
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:23.840]  i started getting these panic attacks and i thought that i had uh
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:27.280]  something physically wrong and let me guess the doctor when you went and
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:30.960]  complained the quasi psychologist isn't really a real doctor
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:34.320]  said don't worry you need another drug on top of it
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:38.240]  yeah you'll love this i went to all these doctors like regular doctors
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:41.360]  finally went to an internist because i kept thinking well maybe i have food
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:44.320]  poisoning or something they couldn't find anything wrong with me so the
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:47.760]  interns goes there's nothing wrong with you go see a psychiatrist
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:51.440]  right so i go to the psychiatrist and literally within five minutes
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:54.800]  of sitting down with this guy he says okay what's wrong with you so i
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:57.200]  list uh tell him what's wrong with me he goes
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:00.800]  um yeah you have what's called panic disorder and
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:04.400]  he says i want to put you on paxel that's what you need and back then they
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:08.000]  weren't telling people that you had suicidal thoughts all he said to me
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:11.280]  was all right you're gonna feel worse for like a couple weeks
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:14.880]  and then you'll kind of it'll kick in and then you'll start yeah but let's be
[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:18.320]  clear let's be clear i can't tell you how many times on a train
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.560]  or in a restaurant uh i've been sitting there next to women mainly for some
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:27.040]  reason i'm yeah i'm really feeling suicidal and really depressed
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:31.600]  and the woman was like but and usually it's some young woman with her mom or
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:35.040]  something but they say now that i'm on three different ones i'll feel
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:38.880]  better but i don't know i wasn't like this before i went on it
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:45.440]  and in the drug trials of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors massive suicides
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:49.120]  massive killings i mean cops will tell you every time they pull up and a woman's
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:52.640]  chop their kid up they go yep look in the medicine cabinet
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:56.400]  they're gonna be on it i mean the cops knew this 20 something years ago
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:00.560]  it is a hallucinogen they are in the hallucinogen family
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.480]  and yeah you know if you took lsd every day most of the time you'd have a good
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:08.000]  trip but other times you're gonna go nuts and jump out a window or kill your
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.640]  kids and that's what these are and marijuana
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:16.160]  i get these idiot emails going why are you bashing marijuana all the sudden
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:20.160]  look i'm for decriminalization but marijuana is a powerful drug and it's
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:23.040]  great for most people that have anxiety or
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:28.080]  problems but with schizophrenics it will make them go into paranoid episodes
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:32.960]  it's in the hallucinogen class okay i've actually done the research
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:36.960]  so it's not reefer madness for 99.9 percent of people
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:41.760]  but for paranoid schizophrenics they get dangerous on marijuana
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:45.840]  it's a fact i'm sorry sir go ahead while you're making a point
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:49.120]  that's all right i'll just say and also that what the serotonin drugs do to you
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:52.800]  is it they make your whole body feel like
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:56.480]  like you're falling asleep and you're kind of floating away all your
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:01.920]  your nerves become really tingly and it's a terrible feeling i mean one
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:05.360]  day i woke up after a year alex i just said i gotta get off this is awful
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:08.320]  well here's the deal do not go off cold turkey that's
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:12.160]  that causes a lot of the shootings you go off that stuff cold turkey is going to
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.640]  be bananas you got to go off very slowly under physicians care
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:19.360]  i want to tell everybody that and that's what the physicians have said on this
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.480]  show i'm not getting medical advice if you go off this stuff
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.720]  you got to be deadly deadly deadly serious about it
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.560]  because sodium fluoride as medical doctors have reported is an adjuvant
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.800]  to serotonin reuptake inhibitors and they magnify the effects of it
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:39.680]  but uh... how did you get off of it uh...
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:44.560]  i just did it myself man i i i i knew i had to get off it slowly i knew that so
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:49.120]  i just weaned myself over like a two month period i just gradually cut down
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:52.080]  no no no you were wanting to commit suicide did you ever have to think about
[02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:55.600]  killing people uh... you know i was thinking about that i don't
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:59.520]  remember thinking that but this is the weird thing else you don't just think
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:03.840]  about generally killing yourself you think about specific ways to do it
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:06.880]  like i would walk down the street i live in new york city at the time
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:10.400]  and you look at like a tall building and you would go you would think
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:13.600]  i could go up there and just jump off the roof and this right now and what's
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:17.680]  happening is they're putting 10 12 13 year olds especially girls who are
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:20.880]  very suggestible on these they're committing suicide mass they don't
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:23.840]  even tell the parents hey this makes you commit suicide it's like
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:28.000]  here you go bye bye little girl have a nice day
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:33.200]  and and i appreciate your call now when i'm driving through traffic and i'm
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:36.800]  going 65 and i see a panhandler on the corner
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:41.200]  i think about if i was to swerve i'd kill that guy
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:44.480]  not because i'm thinking about i want to kill him my brain's like okay there's a
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:47.280]  car pulling up at that stop sign he could run it
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.560]  uh... let me slow down a little bit in case they uh you know run that stop
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.120]  sign or encounter red light okay that bum looks really drunk
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:58.160]  uh... that red lights probably going to change the gray before i get there but
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:02.080]  he may wander out in the road i better get over in this other lane
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:05.600]  but see somebody who's put on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:10.320]  it gets rid of impulse control and so you're in a hallucinogenic dream state
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:14.800]  it is is the best way is what it does and so you're just like oh it's a dream
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:20.400]  well all just you know run him over and it's not that you're even wanting to
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:24.080]  be homicidal it's that your brain's having those calculations okay watch
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:25.680]  y'all i could run up with that bomb using it
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:28.720]  okay there's a truck coming there you know you gotta have defensive driving
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:32.000]  you know you know the brain's taking it all in you know changing the radio
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.240]  and here i'm scanning scanning scanning and
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:39.120]  i mean you know these women that kill their kids and husbands
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:43.120]  but predominantly here this is like i don't know i just couldn't stop thinking
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:47.520]  about drowning my children so i got them all dressed nicely and
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:50.480]  took them each one in and put them under the water
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:54.880]  the eight-year-old the seven-year-old the five-year-old the two-year-old i
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:58.800]  i just don't know officers i just and you know and they go look at the medicine
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:02.320]  cabinet she's on four or five the average texas foster child so
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:05.840]  stagnation wine is on seven psychotropics until they start
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:09.040]  having seizures they're on so many and then it's like oh we'll put you on an
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:12.000]  anti-seizure med
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:18.400]  they've had some physicians go public about this i mean this is hard core
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:21.600]  all right and and and you just know they or they the police said we're gonna
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:24.400]  arrest him if he doesn't go under psychiatric care in september and they
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:27.520]  won't say he's under psychiatric care they always work while it's big news
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:30.080]  keep it quiet you know in a few months it's going to come out i'm going to be
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:33.680]  here on the show with the article that that guy was loaded up on stuff
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:37.120]  i'll bet my bottom dollar he was on riddling type grudge from the time he
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:40.080]  was about 10 because the school demanded it
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.280]  schools ordered me on riddling and my dad said no way
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:45.840]  he went in with literature about how it shrunk the size of the brain and all
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.440]  that and they shut up you know because i was
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:51.680]  raising my hand a lot and stuff like that kind of like you get a little puppy
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:54.320]  and it's running around you know on the floor wanting to play with you do you
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:57.920]  drug a puppy because they're doing that no totally young mammals do

[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:18.560]  training us on how to listen to the phone calls and and
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:22.720]  tell whether the customers were arguing into document things like that
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:26.800]  and i'm a buddy of mine i no longer work with the company for some reason about
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:30.240]  a month after i called you i was let go from my job at bright house
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:34.400]  but um but two friends of mine who have bright house both have the jessie
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:37.280]  ventura episodes taken off their dvr and when they
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:40.640]  told me about it i thought they were absolutely nuts because as someone who
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:43.840]  worked there we were taught that we can't do that
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:48.480]  and when i went over my one friend's house and i searched on his dvr log
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:52.320]  there's a place that you can go to see when something is removed and when
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:55.440]  something's put on no matter why it's removed whether it's full or whether you
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:42:58.960]  just take it off and the show did not even list that it
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:04.000]  was ever even recorded or taken off and that just shocked the crap out of me
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:08.480]  because i had watched it on his dvr and i said surely it the dvr was just full
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:12.400]  and that's why no no and and listen it's still on youtube though they're jerking
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:15.600]  it down off certain sites the police state episode
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:19.040]  you know there's only like on one version a hundred and twenty thousand
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:22.880]  other eighty thousand and other fifty thousand i mean there's not even a half
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:25.760]  a million views of the police state episode
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:29.520]  i'm here on a syndicated show telling people folks you better watch it you
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:31.920]  better get it i mean we're not making up that
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:35.760]  homeland security threatened true tv to remove it and then there was an attempt
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:38.640]  to cover that up until ventura went public
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:43.600]  and then now they're they're threatening all these different dvr companies
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:47.680]  there's litigation going on or starting behind the scenes where some companies go
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:50.640]  we have a contract that we're allowed to have it on people's things
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:55.280]  and i mean i mean this is a big news issue that they're now using dvr's to
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:58.800]  remote erase things we wrote articles about it weeks ago
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:04.640]  no mainstream news no nothing but decades over a decade after i was first
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:08.960]  told this operators cable people telephone
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:16.000]  company folks private plumbers with any big company
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.880]  large parts of the profit of those companies
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:22.800]  is the tattletale money i saw 60 minutes years ago about a
[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:27.520]  guy he sued for discrimination black guy owned a arborist company and he would
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:31.840]  he would fly to houston and other cities to go see the trees he was buying
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:36.320]  then their ship by 18 wheeler in one place like cash we got a discount
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:38.800]  and the woman behind the counter saw that he paid for the ticket with cash and
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:43.360]  stuff this was like in the late 90s and had the air marshall steal his money
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:46.480]  and take it and they ruled you know we can take your money doesn't matter if you
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:52.800]  got receipts or you're buying trees and the point is there's spies everywhere
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:56.800]  and you know i i had a guy from the carpet company called the police on me
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:00.400]  years ago and or tried to it when he got back and they said no no you're
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:03.600]  allowed to have guns in texas he's in my house he sees
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:07.280]  a gun and tries to call the cops i mean this is mental illness
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:11.120]  and yeah the cable guy's spying on you and it's so creepy when you got to have
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:14.400]  work people from big companies in your house and they walk in they ask
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:16.720]  questions you're sitting there trying to read a newspaper
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:19.680]  play with blocks with your kids on the floor and they'll try to act like they're
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:22.880]  being friendly talking to you but you know the questions in the order it's
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:25.840]  like come on man just i'm here to pay you money
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:28.640]  the cops can't get in here without a warrant but you're in here spying on me
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:32.800]  and i don't even do that but then i made the mistake of you know telling the
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:36.000]  the enterprise the rent a car lady that and she went ahead and double charged me
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:39.840]  just to show she was boss i mean it's just a culture wanting to get
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:44.240]  taken to hell wanting to be robbed by government i mean so many americans
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:48.400]  love tyranny and don't worry they're going to get everything they want
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:52.080]  so so so they're at bright house networks um
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.080]  were you based out of florida or where were you based out of i was based out
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:59.840]  of uh the land florida and we were actually trained to

[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:45.680]  going back to Ted Anderson Ted according to MSNBC and democracy now if
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:49.680]  you criticize federal reserve monetary policy
[02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:52.640]  you're going to cause people to shoot congresswomen in the head
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:56.240]  and you're a racist so uh why don't you just shut up
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:00.400]  about what the federal reserve's done and maybe i should just shut up
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.000]  and uh because that's the american way and maybe we should just uh thank the
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.760]  federal reserve for all they're doing well i think alex they already have you
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:10.800]  and i on their blacklist i don't think there's a whole lot we can do about it
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:15.440]  anymore and uh you know what uh it it it befuddles
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:20.800]  me to think that the that the people would buy such nonsense uh you know
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:23.520]  no it's wrong to criticize tyranny it's good they're training the entire
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:27.200]  population to to spy for any reason to take people's
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:30.800]  children and harass everyone and this is wonderful
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:33.600]  yeah i totally trust the government that's been caught thousands of times
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:36.720]  murdering citizens and secret experiments these are nice people we
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:39.520]  shouldn't talk about about them that might cause folks to actually say no to
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:43.120]  tyranny uh ted i wanted to get you on because
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:46.160]  they're announcing another big shakeup the world is moving away from the
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:49.760]  dollar a lot faster and uh golden silver has shot back
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:52.880]  up every time they drop it down it shoots back up you've been able to secure
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:56.560]  a lot of gold and silver at extremely low prices when it was lower
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.400]  and again pass on the lower price now even though it's going up
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:03.600]  and that's why these radio specials are deals that i can't find anywhere else
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:07.120]  i mean these are really good deals tell folks about uh today's special gold and
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:10.640]  silver offers yeah sure i'm right now i mean that
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:13.920]  endgame video is going to explain what goes on in the economy and what's
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:16.560]  happening out there i would suggest that people get that
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:19.760]  easiest way to get it the endgame bomb a deception
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:22.720]  follow the republic all three of them put together we'll put three silver
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:25.680]  dollars in there with it we ship it for 97
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:28.000]  dollars i don't think you can beat that anywhere
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:31.520]  but just you know basically all around what's going on
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:35.840]  uh with silver prices going up we just lowered our prices on that
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:39.680]  survival bag of silver and uh and that's what i'm suggesting that
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:42.560]  people pick up too when i realize we sell it at
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:46.720]  one thousand dimes or one hundred dollars phase value and currently our
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:51.120]  price is 2164 dollars i dropped that price a hundred
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:54.960]  bucks and silver just went up uh from you know from
[02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:59.760]  27 dollars to 29 dollars and to be clear ted though with the silver
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:03.440]  the the the three silver dollars three films
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:08.000]  and shipping for 97 dollars that is roughly a hundred and sixty dollar
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.120]  value for 97 i mean you're getting the films and the
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:15.280]  shipping basically for free that is an insane deal i mean that's a great deal
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:19.360]  if it was three silver dollars for that price much less films and the shipping
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:21.840]  i mean when you just add the free shipping that normally would be like
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:25.120]  you know five to ten bucks on three coins uh because you've got to send it
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:27.200]  where it's you're registered so it's protected
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:30.240]  that's below spot right there when you take out the shipping
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:33.680]  and then you get three free films my three hottest films on top of it
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:40.000]  800 686 2237 800 686 237 you got a lot of other specials what are
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:41.920]  your silver half dollars going for right now
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:46.000]  presently right now the silver half dollars are 1403 and like i said the
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:50.960]  survival bag of dimes presently right now 2164 dollars
[02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:56.560]  that's for a thousand face uh alex that means that dimes are 21 times as much
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:01.440]  as it was back when they're a real dime in 1964 hate speech do not tell people
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:05.680]  about devaluation hate hate this man is being racist
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:09.760]  yeah i guess so man i'll have to continue to be that way oh my gosh he's talking
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:12.640]  about you know he told people buy silver when it was five
[02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:16.000]  dollars an ounce now it's up at 30 he's evil i mean
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.120]  and what else can i say evil evil evil don't buy it
