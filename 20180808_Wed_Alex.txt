[00:00.000 --> 00:29.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot make up the incredible global firestorm that InfoWars
[00:29.080 --> 00:33.400]  and all of our listeners and viewers are at the very center of because believe me, you're
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.480]  all on the team, you're all the same as the quarterback. Without you we're nothing and
[00:38.480 --> 00:43.720]  we could lose this with you, we're going to win. First off, the globalists are panicking
[00:43.720 --> 00:49.920]  because the Republicans were winning these special elections and primaries yesterday.
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.600]  They're going into total, total meltdown mode even though big blue blood Republicans like
[00:54.600 --> 01:02.920]  the Koch brothers have been backing the Democrats. Unbelievable. So we're going to be going over
[01:02.920 --> 01:09.040]  all that. You have former Obama administration officials ordering Twitter to remove me and
[01:09.040 --> 01:18.280]  Jack Dorsey is still standing firm. We've got Howard Dean saying I promote Nazism with
[01:18.280 --> 01:25.280]  no link and saying take down the Nazi now. They're now accusing Jack Dorsey of things
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.800]  he's never done saying that he's helping me Docs, Sandy Hook families. I never did that.
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.720]  There's no link. Just because the New York Times says it doesn't mean it's true. The
[01:32.720 --> 01:42.280]  New York Times is there to murder truth. The New York Times is truth's assassin continuing.
[01:42.280 --> 01:48.200]  Here's the big one. Document cam shot please. Put it on screen from Twitter. Real Alex shows
[01:48.200 --> 01:56.800]  we are number one trending app in news. Number one trending. Click on that for a larger image
[01:56.800 --> 02:04.120]  please. Number one trending. Guess what we are total out of thousands of news apps.
[02:04.120 --> 02:16.320]  We are number three total in the world surpassing CNN and Fox News. But guess what happened?
[02:16.320 --> 02:20.760]  Go to my Twitter. Real Alex Jones. We have a video of it. In fact I'm going to do a demonstration
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.760]  here so it's in HD. So I have to do where somebody show it. Google because we're also
[02:25.760 --> 02:31.400]  number one in trending on Google and guess what? Number three on Google total. Google
[02:31.400 --> 02:39.160]  does not list us. It does not show that the app exists. This is a three week old app Info
[02:39.160 --> 02:44.960]  Wars official. We knew this was coming. I told you it was coming ahead of the midterms.
[02:44.960 --> 02:52.400]  I thought it would maybe be in a few more weeks later. We are number one but it doesn't
[02:52.400 --> 03:03.200]  show you who's number one. Oh above the Huffington Post and one American news. Isn't that just
[03:03.200 --> 03:08.800]  interesting? It won't show you who won the football game. They won't show you who won
[03:08.800 --> 03:16.080]  the wrestling match. They won't show you who won the Indy 500. Oh but then if you actually
[03:16.080 --> 03:26.480]  go and click into it it comes up. Isn't that just special? How long till that's gone, gone,
[03:26.480 --> 03:32.720]  gone. But what happens when the jury sees that? And what happens when the jury sees
[03:32.720 --> 03:37.920]  this? Well they think by then they've stolen the election in 2018 and 2020 and they'll
[03:37.920 --> 03:44.200]  have a tyranny here and it won't matter. But guess what CNN's been doing since they got
[03:44.200 --> 03:51.520]  us taken off Facebook and everywhere else? Info Wars app overtakes CNN on charts. CNN
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.840]  desperately lobbies Apple to censor. If that isn't tortuous interference, if that isn't
[03:56.840 --> 04:02.520]  racketeering, if that isn't a restaurant, if CNN was a restaurant with feces on the
[04:02.520 --> 04:09.720]  ground, roaches everywhere, E. Coli, Salmonella, food poisoning and we've got this glistening
[04:09.720 --> 04:14.760]  restaurant with the most lavish chefs, great prices, parking lot overflowing, lines around
[04:14.760 --> 04:20.600]  the corner and CNN's calling the fire marshal saying, get over there, there's too many people
[04:20.600 --> 04:24.320]  in there and CNN's running around the street with bullhorns. There's roaches in there,
[04:24.320 --> 04:29.800]  the size of a chihuahua. There's rats the size of a doberman. Don't eat there, you'll
[04:29.800 --> 04:36.080]  get sick. Meanwhile, the windows are all gross, everything's falling apart. Nobody's
[04:36.080 --> 04:40.520]  over here eating in a restaurant. CNN's got a cigarette here, they're not going, you
[04:40.520 --> 04:47.600]  know what you do. When they close at midnight, you burn that joint down. We want Info Wars
[04:47.600 --> 04:53.800]  off the air now. But oh, Trump criticizes, he's hurting the First Amendment. Oh, don't
[04:53.800 --> 04:57.280]  criticize this, that's violating the First Amendment. That is the First Amendment, you
[04:57.280 --> 05:00.860]  anti-American criminals.

[06:19.760 --> 06:36.960]  It's 8-8 Wednesday, the 8th day of August 2018. I am Alex Jones, your host. My goodness,
[06:36.960 --> 06:46.960]  it's 8-888. Haha! And InfoWars.com free official app is the number one trending app in the
[06:46.960 --> 06:55.400]  world. Number one trending app on Google Android. Number one on iPhone and number one on other
[06:55.400 --> 07:00.760]  platforms. But guess what happens when you go to the Google free store? Even with all
[07:00.760 --> 07:10.080]  the paid apps, it's free and it's number one, but on most phones won't show up. They've
[07:10.080 --> 07:13.760]  got it blocked on phones, but on some computers it comes up. And that's the same thing happened
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.600]  when I was the number one podcast in Joe Rogan's history. It was never listed on iTunes. You
[07:18.600 --> 07:24.640]  had to hand search it, but it was number one for a year and never put to the top because
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.240]  it would have gotten even bigger. That's how they operate. They force feed what they want.
[07:29.240 --> 07:35.600]  And CNN, after they brag, they help get us lobbied off YouTube, Google see listing us,
[07:35.600 --> 07:39.840]  Facebook, everywhere else is bullying Twitter to take us down. And here's the headline from
[07:39.840 --> 07:47.680]  Breitbart. InfoWars app overtakes CNN on charts. CNN lobbies app to censor. They say we want
[07:47.680 --> 07:53.480]  it removed. We want it taken off. We don't want people to go to the digital store and
[07:53.480 --> 08:01.640]  go in and get what they want. No, no, no. CNN's apps free too. But people don't want
[08:01.640 --> 08:06.840]  it. It's only been out three weeks. CNN has had their apps for years. Our apps been out
[08:06.840 --> 08:12.860]  three weeks and it's already number one in trending and already number three on Android
[08:12.860 --> 08:21.480]  and on Apple. And it's trending within days to be number one total. And they aren't going
[08:21.480 --> 08:33.360]  to allow that. Are they? 4.9 star review out of five. Everyone loves it. But that's okay.
[08:33.360 --> 08:38.400]  CNN, why they're CNN, so when they're not lying to you about WMDs or pushing the Arab
[08:38.400 --> 08:43.360]  Spring and helping kill millions of Iraqis, they're busy telling how hateful I am because
[08:43.360 --> 08:47.520]  when the public questioned Sandy Hook, I questioned some of it as well and believe people have
[08:47.520 --> 08:51.600]  a right to question. And then later years ago said I believed it happened. And so they
[08:51.600 --> 08:56.320]  just lie and say that I said nobody died at Parkland and got me taken off YouTube till
[08:56.320 --> 08:59.960]  YouTube went and looked and they said that was a mistake. And they took the strikes off
[08:59.960 --> 09:06.520]  and put us back up. But three months later, right before the election, they were back
[09:06.520 --> 09:12.560]  and they lied about us again and got us taken off. CNN knew more about my account with Google
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.960]  than I did. They were in my account and talking about my account and how much money we made
[09:17.960 --> 09:23.680]  a month off of it and what we were doing and what was going on. That's from a few days
[09:23.680 --> 09:30.320]  when we were surpassing CNN. Now we're number one in trending and number three on Google
[09:30.320 --> 09:40.440]  and on Apple. And within days, if not hours, we will be number one on total apps. Now are
[09:40.440 --> 09:52.280]  they going to allow that? Are they going to allow that? No. And so in front of the world,
[09:52.280 --> 09:55.960]  they're going to continue to attack us and they know that we're getting record traffic
[09:55.960 --> 10:02.680]  to infowars.com and newswars.com. So MailChimp, we've been using for five, six years to send
[10:02.680 --> 10:06.560]  out under all the rules properly our emails to you every day. Notice you haven't got emails
[10:06.560 --> 10:14.360]  since yesterday. They said no, bye-bye. You can't use this. You're evil. And then you
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.560]  can't comment on infowars.com or newswars.com when it's a very popular function with discus
[10:19.560 --> 10:26.560]  or discuss. That's gone. They just said no, you violate our terms of service. Even though
[10:26.560 --> 10:31.840]  it's their moderators and their system, that's why we liked it because it's hard to moderate
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.800]  all this stuff. And so what they're saying is they violate their own terms. Now what
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.200]  you're doing is you're racketeering. You're going to come out and you're going to deny
[10:41.200 --> 10:48.480]  us services on our own website. Oh, but it's their own company, really. Samsung TVs say
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.240]  when you buy this TV, you waive your rights. We can watch and listen to you in your home
[10:52.240 --> 10:58.840]  and share it with third parties because we're our own company. How about all these congressmen
[10:58.840 --> 11:02.720]  and women running for office, neck and neck with Democrats? Democrats can all advertise.
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.360]  They can all be political on their Facebook pages and YouTube pages, but Republicans are
[11:06.360 --> 11:12.600]  all being blocked as well. Is that just because they're a company now? Maybe AT&T will tell
[11:12.600 --> 11:18.240]  the Republicans you can only use your telephones, you know, 10% of the time. You'd be like,
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.160]  well, I pay for a service. You can't be letting me only use the phone 10% of the time and
[11:22.160 --> 11:27.920]  letting the Democrats use it 100%. That's what this shadow banning and all this is.
[11:27.920 --> 11:34.480]  So why did Jack Dorsey come out and say, Alex Jones hasn't violated our rules? Their rules
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.760]  are nebulous. Their rules are globalist. Their rules are like SJW stuff where no one could
[11:39.760 --> 11:45.320]  follow them. It's all subjective. What is hate speech? One man's hate speech is one
[11:45.320 --> 11:48.840]  man's religion, vice versa. They let the Islamists do whatever they want, but if you
[11:48.840 --> 11:55.800]  criticize it, you know, you get restricted. And Twitter knows that Trump came out a week
[11:55.800 --> 11:59.960]  and a half ago. Let's put this tweet up there for the president. We can find it. And the
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.120]  president said, you know, this shadow banning, I'm getting a lot of reports of Congress people
[12:04.120 --> 12:09.360]  and other Republicans and conservatives very, very troubling. It's illegal going to do something
[12:09.360 --> 12:16.280]  about it. So I believe the reason Jack Dorsey didn't join the rest of the pack in banning
[12:16.280 --> 12:22.160]  me like he did Milo a few years ago is because he knows that Trump and this broadcast and
[12:22.160 --> 12:27.880]  the Republican Congress is aware of what's going on. And suddenly days after Trump put
[12:27.880 --> 12:35.200]  that tweet out, suddenly we were only restricted in some of our tweets. Most of them actually
[12:35.200 --> 12:40.560]  went out. So instead of getting five retweets, we'd get 10,000 again. Now some that somebody
[12:40.560 --> 12:47.160]  dubbed political or something, which everybody else can do, Trump crossing the swamp as George
[12:47.160 --> 12:52.560]  Washington, stuff like that would still get blocked. So you can see they're in there still
[12:52.560 --> 12:56.280]  trying to bend it to the Democrats, bend it, but they know they're getting washed, but
[12:56.280 --> 12:59.840]  they think, hey, they can just make it three months and get Democrats in the impeachment
[12:59.840 --> 13:03.960]  can start and then it'll be okay. But if they lose, if it doesn't work, there's going to
[13:03.960 --> 13:11.240]  be hell to pay. But maybe not. The Republican Congress is so stupid when it comes to tech
[13:11.240 --> 13:16.440]  and these issues so dumb, the terms they use on the, the Democrats are to the Democrat
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.160]  Senator Murphy calling us the rotten tip of the iceberg saying ban all the conservatives
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.880]  incredibly out in the open. He goes banning just one website isn't enough, which he's
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.200]  admitting they're trying to ban our site itself. We need to ban them all. What he's really
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.560]  banning is our multimedia, our reporters, our people, our guests. They're saying all
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.040]  of you can't be on Facebook. All of you can't be on YouTube. All of you can't be on all
[13:41.040 --> 13:48.240]  these platforms, iTunes everywhere else. And then they're testing to see, well, Joe Rogan
[13:48.240 --> 13:51.080]  have me on to defend free speech. He was already telling me two weeks ago, he wants to be on
[13:51.080 --> 13:55.520]  to have it heard the time now, Willie, or will he get scared and not thinking, keep his head
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.800]  down? Because then later he'll lose his speech. And will everybody else have me on? Well,
[13:59.800 --> 14:03.680]  the truth is people are lining up around the block to have me on their broadcast. People
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.160]  invite me on all the time. I'm usually too busy, but I've been doing it, working really
[14:07.160 --> 14:12.240]  hard doing a lot of interviews because I need to fight for free speech right now, not just
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.680]  my speech, but everybody's because we're Domino number one, make no mistake. So Howard
[14:17.680 --> 14:21.440]  D and all these Obama people, they're demanding we be taken down and they're now they're more
[14:21.440 --> 14:29.520]  shrill because their socialist star, Alexandria Cortez had all the people she endorsed lose
[14:29.520 --> 14:35.800]  their primaries. But yeah, when you tell folks you're a commie, doesn't work too well.
[14:35.800 --> 14:41.840]  So they're now in panic mode as Republicans won in these key battleground areas that Soros
[14:41.840 --> 14:47.960]  poured megatimes, hundreds of millions of dollars of illegal money into this stuff.
[14:47.960 --> 14:52.800]  And they are swinging for the fences with brass knuckles. We're wearing, you know, 10
[14:52.800 --> 14:57.240]  10 ounce gloves, but we're still defeating them, even though it's rigged because people
[14:57.240 --> 15:06.160]  know what's going on and the jig is up. So news wars.com info wars.com go to info wars.com

[20:22.000 --> 20:36.080]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones. This is America. This is 2018 three months out
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.080]  from one of the most important elections in our history and affecting the entire world.
[20:42.080 --> 20:47.040]  And finally, the Daily Mail Breitbart following Drudge's lead in the start of the week ago
[20:47.040 --> 20:53.760]  are coming out to our defense saying this is dangerous or having top lawyers, top computer
[20:53.760 --> 20:59.600]  scientist on the site on XM on their Breitbart show. I was listening to it for hours this morning
[20:59.600 --> 21:03.760]  reading all their reports and they're going into the scientific history, how the racketeering is
[21:03.760 --> 21:08.240]  working, how it's illegal, how they're building sites to monitor it, how Congress has got to
[21:08.240 --> 21:13.360]  stop this right now, how this is trying to steal the election, true election meddling.
[21:13.360 --> 21:26.400]  And now infowar's app overtakes CNN on charts. CNN lobbies Apple to censor. You heard me right.
[21:27.680 --> 21:33.120]  Infowar shot up the charts. It's gone to number one in new apps trending. Number one and it's
[21:33.120 --> 21:41.360]  number three set in days to go to number one total. Infowar's app overtakes CNN on charts,
[21:41.360 --> 21:48.320]  CNN lobbies Apple to censor. This is America. This isn't the old Soviet Union. This isn't
[21:48.320 --> 21:56.000]  communist China. And what do you expect? Google is on the air in China with their propaganda.
[21:56.000 --> 22:04.000]  Google is moving back into China with their own censorship and media system. Apple has
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.920]  its media company based there and is openly involved in mass censorship. Apple has officially
[22:09.920 --> 22:15.600]  moved to China years ago, but made it official five months ago and became state run. And I'm
[22:15.600 --> 22:23.600]  the only person hammering this, or at least I was. Now the information is coming out.
[22:24.880 --> 22:29.040]  And Congress is talking about it. They're catching Chinese spies inside the National
[22:29.040 --> 22:34.960]  Security Agency, inside the CIA, inside the FBI, inside the House Intelligence and Senate
[22:34.960 --> 22:41.040]  Intelligence Committee offices of Dianne Feinstein and others. Obama and the globalist allowed
[22:41.040 --> 22:48.880]  total penetration. Don't you remember when they kept having Chinese generals in the White House
[22:49.520 --> 22:54.000]  for fundraisers and giving them millions of dollars illegally with suitcases of cash?
[22:54.000 --> 23:02.880]  No one got in trouble. That was in 1995. 96. Can you imagine what it's like now? Total
[23:02.880 --> 23:08.160]  penetration. They own our debt. They own Hollywood. They've gotten all the major defense secrets that
[23:08.160 --> 23:14.480]  aren't completely classified. They have pushed for us to be censored. They go to Davos and
[23:14.480 --> 23:18.720]  Bragg how they're going to take down America. And I keep telling you this, and that's why they
[23:18.720 --> 23:25.520]  finally moved and jumped the shark to ban me off the Internet. Because the president is listening,
[23:26.080 --> 23:29.600]  the campaign is listening, the military is listening, and they don't know what to do.
[23:29.600 --> 23:33.680]  Well, let me give you a little newsflash. The military already knew all of this.
[23:35.680 --> 23:38.640]  They had made the decision. It was too damning to tell the American people,
[23:39.760 --> 23:43.360]  and they thought they could fix it by turning the economy back on and quietly pulling out
[23:43.360 --> 23:46.800]  the traders that were managing the Chi-Com spies. Because it's kind of a wedding between
[23:46.800 --> 23:51.200]  deep state, the globalists in China. Say China runs us. I mean, we have total penetration.
[23:51.200 --> 23:54.560]  Then they started double crossing Obama the last two years of his administration. Remember?
[23:55.680 --> 23:59.360]  So to keep some leverage on him, the deep state went, oh yeah, we'll pivot some ships and stuff
[23:59.360 --> 24:02.320]  out to where you're at. And they said, we're building islands. Get out of the way. We've
[24:02.320 --> 24:08.080]  compromised you. If you talk bad about us, we'll expose people on your payroll, on our payroll.
[24:08.080 --> 24:11.840]  Remember that when China said a couple years ago before Trump got elected? They said,
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.800]  if you keep giving us trouble with your pivot to Asia and all this China stuff, we'll start outing
[24:16.800 --> 24:27.040]  spies. And then as if that wasn't a big enough red flare, 5000 red flares, as if that wasn't
[24:27.040 --> 24:33.200]  totally insane. It got worse, didn't it? They came out yesterday and they said,
[24:33.200 --> 24:38.000]  we already own Apple and control its factories. They've merged with us. We have all the codes.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.880]  We will hold it hostage and shut down production to your trillion dollar thing if you don't do
[24:42.880 --> 24:47.520]  that. Well, it's not ours anyways. And yeah, do iPhones in my experience work better than most
[24:47.520 --> 24:56.320]  droids? Okay, yeah. But the issue is Apple is as evil as it gets. It's the worst. And Google's
[24:56.320 --> 25:01.200]  a close second moving to China. So what do they do when they're traders like this?
[25:02.160 --> 25:07.600]  They say that America is run by Russians. When the Russians are tough, they can fight,
[25:07.600 --> 25:11.600]  they can build rockets, they got missiles. They can't even keep their country running.
[25:11.600 --> 25:17.120]  If Russia was in our business, I'd be on their ass, like I was during the whole uranium deals
[25:17.120 --> 25:24.400]  with Hillary. That's wrong. But Russia's not the threat, ladies and gentlemen. That's how they
[25:24.400 --> 25:30.000]  project onto Trump, a nationalist, that he's a trader. The New York Times, and I'm going to get
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.720]  around to going through the two hours of audio and finding this clip. I want to play it today.
[25:34.720 --> 25:38.720]  The New York Times had this report. It was working with this other Pulitzer prize winner.
[25:38.720 --> 25:42.560]  That's like a Nobel Peace Prize. It means it's like an iron cross in my opinion,
[25:42.560 --> 25:48.960]  you know, from Adolf Hitler. These assassins of truth, these twisters,
[25:48.960 --> 25:56.560]  and the lady sat back in her chair and she went, tell me about how you work for RT.
[25:56.560 --> 26:02.160]  And I went, huh? Yeah, you know, what they pay you, all this other stuff. And she was rolling
[26:02.160 --> 26:07.600]  her eyes. When I was like, I've never worked for RT. I've never gotten money from RT. I've never
[26:07.600 --> 26:10.960]  traveled with RT. I've been on RT in years. I'm like, I've been interviewed by the New York Times
[26:10.960 --> 26:17.760]  probably 100 times. Do I work for you, lady? But that's how sick this has gotten, ladies and
[26:17.760 --> 26:23.280]  gentlemen. And I mean, these people are in their own echo chamber of America hating.
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.640]  They're in their own echo chamber of control. They're in their own echo chamber where they've
[26:26.640 --> 26:29.920]  got to do this or they won't get their paycheck. So they believe this stuff.
[26:32.400 --> 26:38.400]  And they get extremely radicalized until they don't even know what planet they're on, where
[26:38.400 --> 26:43.360]  they scream Nazi scum and won't let Candace Owens, a beautiful black lady, a patriot, a liberal,
[26:43.360 --> 26:49.520]  have her meal because she's pro-America. A bunch of weird white people screaming in a black lady,
[26:49.520 --> 26:55.120]  you're a white supremacist. They're bullies. They're crazy. They're out of control. Now,
[26:56.960 --> 26:59.520]  obviously, we need funding under this massive attack.
[27:01.120 --> 27:06.000]  We need it extremely bad. And if you haven't gone to infowarstore.com, we got the best water

[30:11.440 --> 30:15.760]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying,

[30:24.320 --> 30:29.440]  word. You are the InfoWars. And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important

[30:35.680 --> 30:41.600]  no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name
[30:41.600 --> 30:47.440]  it. And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,

[32:09.200 --> 32:13.920]  then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[32:13.920 --> 32:21.360]  children and Islamophobia. And then voila, two weeks later ban InfoWars completely off of dozens
[32:21.360 --> 32:28.880]  of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds. Go to infowars.com

[32:44.800 --> 32:49.840]  articles on our own platform. But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash
[32:49.840 --> 32:55.120]  show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others
[32:55.120 --> 33:10.960]  with the information and point out, this is the verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see.
[33:10.960 --> 33:28.160]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[33:28.160 --> 33:40.880]  Gavin McInnis, the creator of Vice, filmmaker, syndicated talk show host at CRTV.com.
[33:40.880 --> 33:43.920]  So this will be the end of the hour. We have a bunch of other guests and I want to open the phones
[33:43.920 --> 33:48.000]  up and you're taking what's happening. But make no mistake, people are now finally getting it.
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.120]  Congress didn't understand how the shadow banning was happening, how Google was delisting people,
[33:53.120 --> 33:58.560]  how the different forms of algorithms strangulation was happening ahead of trying to steal the
[33:58.560 --> 34:02.560]  election. That's what this is, is election meddling by big tech, the Democrats and others.
[34:03.200 --> 34:07.120]  But now they've jumped the shark. They had hearings in the last few months where the
[34:07.120 --> 34:11.040]  Republicans just couldn't find their butt with both hands and it green-lighted
[34:12.880 --> 34:17.520]  the intensified censorship, not just of me, but everybody else. There's big algorithms,
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.200]  Breitbart's been doing a great job with some of their scientists and computer people
[34:21.200 --> 34:25.200]  and some of the groups in Europe that can track the different types of censorship,
[34:25.200 --> 34:33.040]  not just shadow banning. And they've dialed it back 50% basically back during Hillary,
[34:33.040 --> 34:38.720]  during the campaign two years ago. And then it went up to about 80% about a month ago and now
[34:38.720 --> 34:42.800]  it's gone about 93% on average. And I gave me those numbers before Facebook admitted,
[34:42.800 --> 34:47.360]  oh, we already dialed back conservatives, 80% quit bitching at us. Because I could see Google
[34:47.360 --> 34:52.960]  analytics, I could see the Facebook analytics were kicked out all that now. And it's just like
[34:52.960 --> 34:56.640]  space age. And you could see when they put the controls in, you go straight down.
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.640]  Someone could go down like this or something. They just flip a switch. It's like when Hillary
[35:02.640 --> 35:09.040]  lost, Alexa just took 2,000 conservative sites and did 80% reduction in them too. It wasn't like
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.040]  the traffic was down, but sponsors looked at it and went, well, your traffic's down. It's like,
[35:13.040 --> 35:17.440]  no, I'm not. It's like when they told Mark Twain, he was dead. He said, no, I'm not. Or it's like,
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.040]  you know, if you hit me in the face and I punch you and you fall down and you look at me and you
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.720]  say, I've killed you. And I'm like, it looks like I'm still standing here, buddy. So they've tried
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.680]  a lot of different fraud, but they're desperately moving now. They're trying to bully Jack Dorsey
[35:29.680 --> 35:35.120]  into removing me. Let me ask Gavin again, this is a smart cookie. Why do you think they're doing
[35:35.120 --> 35:38.320]  all this now? Do you think they'll get away with it? Because folks seem to be figuring out that
[35:38.320 --> 35:43.360]  I'm just patient zero as the beta test going into the election. And if they win, they're really going
[35:43.360 --> 35:48.640]  to crack down even more and I guess solidify this. And why do you think Dorsey hasn't banned me when
[35:48.640 --> 35:55.920]  like 15 platforms, I can't list them all, webchimp, discuss, not just iTunes, not just Facebook,
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.880]  not just YouTube, just everywhere. And now it appears they're deplatforming, deleting other
[36:00.880 --> 36:06.560]  people that put my new videos up. They grab. So I mean, this is, this is like beyond what you hear
[36:06.560 --> 36:09.360]  about in China. It's pretty amazing. What does Gavin McInnis think?
[36:10.640 --> 36:18.960]  I think that Jack is smarter than these other CEOs and he knows that this is bad for the left.
[36:19.520 --> 36:26.160]  I don't think Jack wants Trump to win. I don't think he likes you, but at least he has the tenacity
[36:26.160 --> 36:32.800]  to realize that when you shut down Alex Jones, you make him stronger. You have the number one
[36:32.800 --> 36:39.680]  app. I talked to you yesterday. It was a number four app. Jack is smart enough to know that just
[36:39.680 --> 36:45.680]  trying to kill you only makes you stronger. We do now, as you speak, is actually gone.
[36:45.680 --> 36:50.800]  It is now number one in news on all platforms, but most Google devices won't show you that it's
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.720]  number one. I know it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. You scroll and as you're scrolling,
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.960]  it won't let you go past two. They're so bad at this. You know, I got to hand it to Stalin. He was
[37:02.960 --> 37:08.400]  much more efficient at fascism than these guys. This is amateur hour at the Apollo.
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.440]  I agree with you. Let me ask you this question. It's a parallel to three African countries in
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.560]  the last 30 years have kicked the minority white population out, taken the farms. Over
[37:18.560 --> 37:21.680]  then a few years, they're starving to death. It's in Bobway, many other examples. Well,
[37:21.680 --> 37:27.360]  the racist communist leaders of South Africa are now kicking most of the whites out, taking their
[37:27.360 --> 37:32.960]  farms, and famine has now kicked off just one year into the new communist government. Wow.
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.200]  I mean, you'd think again, just like them kicking conservatives and libertarians off the web,
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.400]  and then their stock tanks, hundreds of billions at Facebook, you think that South Africa,
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.000]  when nations bordering them, have done the exact same thing and starved to death in mass
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.240]  and collapse, you think they'd say, hey, let's leave these productive Christian farmers here.
[37:53.280 --> 37:59.200]  You know what? This is a lot like your case in the sense that everyone has this sort of
[38:01.040 --> 38:05.840]  fortune cookie little note explaining what the story is, and it's not even close to the truth.
[38:05.840 --> 38:11.200]  So no one's seen your show that wants to ban it. They just heard rumors about conspiracy theories
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.360]  and you attacking kids and all this stuff. They've never actually watched the show.
[38:15.360 --> 38:19.280]  Same with Ann Coulter. They hate her books. They never actually read one sentence
[38:19.280 --> 38:23.760]  in any of her books. It's all based on the rumors, the mystique. It's a game of telephone.
[38:23.760 --> 38:28.720]  And with South Africa, the rumor is whites came in, stole all the land,
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.560]  and now the blacks are saying, we'd like our land back at some point. That sounds reasonable.
[38:32.560 --> 38:38.400]  I mean, they had apartheid. That was mean. That's not the truth at all. The story there is that
[38:38.400 --> 38:44.640]  there is one communist party that is oppressing everyone in South Africa, including blacks,
[38:44.640 --> 38:51.360]  including other tribes, and especially including white farmers. And these national socialists,
[38:51.360 --> 38:56.720]  just like the Nazis, in fact, they have a tenant now, land seizure without compensation. That is
[38:56.720 --> 39:01.360]  literally word for word, as Dinesh D'Souza points out in his new movie, Death of a Nation,
[39:01.360 --> 39:07.360]  that is literally word for word, a Nazi doctrine. So the rumors you're hearing about South Africa,
[39:07.360 --> 39:12.240]  that it's about, you know, white black people getting revenge for whites. No, the whites bought
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.360]  that land. That was all acquired justly. There was no one really there when the boars settled
[39:17.360 --> 39:22.800]  South Africa. But no, you've done your study because just like the boars were kind of like Amish
[39:22.800 --> 39:26.720]  Light, you know, most of the Amish actually are German or Swiss, but they're very similar.
[39:26.720 --> 39:30.720]  So I've read several four or five books about the whole history of South Africa. And as you said,
[39:30.720 --> 39:36.160]  almost no one was there except, quote, what they call the Aborigines or the natives or the Bush
[39:36.160 --> 39:41.040]  people. And then when the whites came in 400 years ago and built wells and infrastructure,
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.640]  there were giant migrations moving in for the work in the diamond mines and the fields. And so
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.880]  they built this whole big giant thing. No one was there, kind of like, you know, Texas. There
[39:50.880 --> 39:53.280]  might have been a couple thousand Native Americans and I'm not saying it's good, what happened to
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.360]  them. But everybody wants to get here now because what we built and now the Communist Party that
[39:57.360 --> 40:02.960]  Mandela was part of takes over, makes it all racial. And now you've got the super Christian,
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.880]  9% Christian, you know, of the population of Christian farmers that are in the middle of
[40:06.880 --> 40:11.840]  nowhere, you know, with lions and King Cobras and everything. And all the local blacks are like,
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.520]  please don't get rid of them. We love working with them. But that's all about to be torn out.
[40:15.520 --> 40:19.680]  Then the Communist will communalize everything and it'll all collapse like happened in China.
[40:20.560 --> 40:25.520]  They're almost out of water in Cape Town. This always happens with communism. It hurts the
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.000]  people. It's purporting to help and leaves everyone starving. They are going to be starving,
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.120]  something like 85%. I forget the exact number, but it's remarkably high of these farms they took
[40:35.120 --> 40:41.840]  take over, cease to be farms. They just subsist farm a few beans for themselves and all the crops
[40:41.840 --> 40:48.320]  die. So they're running out of food, running out of water based on communist greed. And people are
[40:48.320 --> 40:54.720]  going for the fortune cookie version, which is it's just a minor land transaction. You know,
[40:54.720 --> 41:00.320]  you keep seeing this again and again. And what happens? People starve. And this is what's happening
[41:00.320 --> 41:08.080]  with you. They're going to say, no more Alex Jones, no more me, no more Candace Owens are
[41:08.080 --> 41:13.040]  going after now. This is a woman who dared to say blacks don't have to be conservative. I mean,
[41:13.040 --> 41:18.880]  liberal. And they're going to end up with much less media, with just state run media.
[41:21.760 --> 41:24.640]  You're absolutely right. We'll come back and play that video. I should have gotten to this
[41:24.640 --> 41:30.000]  in the last few days. I mentioned it. Antifa protesters that cost conservative Charlie Kirk and
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.200]  Candace Owens at Philadelphia Cafe. This happens to me. It happens to Milo. And they literally
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.240]  start screaming Nazi. Howard Dean has called me a Nazi and called for Twitter to ban me.
[41:40.240 --> 41:46.240]  Folks, everyone knows the Nazis hate me. Everybody knows my ex-wife is part Jewish. Everybody knows
[41:46.240 --> 41:50.880]  that I'm not anti-Israel. But they just keep calling me a Nazi. And then they're screaming at
[41:50.880 --> 41:59.040]  a black woman screaming Nazi, Nazi, Nazi. These people are insane. Where's it going to go, Gavin?
[42:00.160 --> 42:04.880]  Well, and they were, you know what they were screaming? They were screaming and white supremacy
[42:04.880 --> 42:10.720]  and F white supremacy at a black woman. And then some of the, the alt left say, no, no, no,
[42:10.720 --> 42:15.280]  they were screaming at a Charlie Kirk. No, they were not screaming at a Charlie Kirk. They had
[42:15.280 --> 42:21.520]  a bullhorn in Candace's face that she had to physically tear away with her hands as they poured
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.680]  water on Charlie Kirk and screamed like hyenas. You know, they're all rich kids. And I, you know
[42:27.680 --> 42:33.440]  what I was thinking the other day? I'm becoming scared of the left. And I don't mean scared like
[42:33.440 --> 42:40.720]  Tony Soprano is out to get me. I mean scared like a psychotic ex-girlfriend who's a stalker
[42:40.720 --> 42:46.480]  and is about to get out of jail. Well, I'm afraid of, I agree. One of these people hits me. They're
[42:46.480 --> 42:50.080]  going, they're going to get it back. And I'm afraid of what I'm going to do to them. We'll be right
[42:50.080 --> 43:11.520]  back. We've got McGinnis from CRTV.com. And on Twitter, you have the underscore McInnis. Stay with us.

[47:21.600 --> 47:31.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[47:35.840 --> 47:41.040]  I can now announce, it's true, the first show I said we were number one on trending and number
[47:41.040 --> 47:46.320]  three on overall news apps, we're now number one on the Android and number one on Apple.
[47:46.320 --> 47:51.280]  So that just happened. We are number one against apps that have been up there for years like the
[47:51.280 --> 47:59.360]  Huffington Post and CNN. They are flipping out and just this morning I saw three reports,
[47:59.360 --> 48:06.560]  I couldn't even watch them all, but the articles on CNN saying ban Alex Jones off of iTunes apps
[48:06.560 --> 48:14.320]  and off of Android. Gavin, I hate to make this about me, but this is getting absolutely, totally
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.320]  insane. I launched an app three weeks ago, figuring all this was coming up a new one.
[48:18.960 --> 48:28.960]  This happens and it has got 4.9 stars. I gotta tell you, I think they jump the
[48:28.960 --> 48:34.320]  shark like the NFL taking a knee and losing 40% of their viewers or Hollywood losing 35% of their
[48:34.320 --> 48:39.360]  revenue going out against Trump. Like you said, they're destroying themselves. They can't stop.
[48:39.360 --> 48:46.560]  Where does this go? Well, it goes with starvation, with information starvation. It goes with
[48:46.560 --> 48:50.800]  a socialist country that starts to eat itself. Like we're seeing this in Canada,
[48:50.800 --> 48:56.720]  we're seeing, we saw this in Britain. They open the borders to mass immigration and they say,
[48:56.720 --> 49:02.640]  replace this population. I want people who owe me one. And then that's the, the country's gone.
[49:02.640 --> 49:08.960]  And this is very unique to America, this whole idea of different voices. The Brits actually
[49:08.960 --> 49:13.360]  started it by encouraging all these different newspapers down the East Coast. And there was,
[49:13.360 --> 49:17.520]  they said, make it right wing, make it left wing, have debates. And the next thing, you know,
[49:17.520 --> 49:24.000]  we go, this is fun. This is colorful. This is interesting. This is, this is humorous that
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.520]  we're using sarcasm and irony. And I'm enjoying myself. Let's start a whole country on this
[49:29.520 --> 49:35.200]  and kick the British out. And they did. And now we're getting back to this monarchy mentality
[49:35.200 --> 49:42.240]  where we can't have conspiracy theories. What the hell is the matter with a conspiracy theory?
[49:42.800 --> 49:48.320]  That's called a theory about someone conspiring. And you had a bunch of conspiracy theories about
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.320]  how they were going to try to, the government was going to try to de-platform you. Turns out
[49:52.320 --> 49:59.280]  that's not a theory anymore. It's a fact. This is like a war on curiosity, fun, humor. It's a war
[49:59.280 --> 50:06.000]  on color. It's a war on what makes America great. Well, you're right. I kind of self-censored myself
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.920]  Sunday morning. I get up. They say a drone has shot missiles at Maduro. I watch all the footage.
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.560]  I go, it's probably a false flag. He's a dictator. He's teetering on collapse. Brazils have to close
[50:16.560 --> 50:20.720]  its border because millions are trying to flee, just like we're having to. Oh, but they're not
[50:20.720 --> 50:26.480]  racist when they do. And so I didn't do anything on it. And then suddenly I read the mainstream
[50:26.480 --> 50:30.640]  news. They go, the U.S. government thinks he staged it or it didn't even happen, or a gas
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.320]  main blew up in a building across the street. The point is, known liars, you don't believe them.
[50:34.320 --> 50:38.720]  You question them. It doesn't mean that you're sure it didn't happen or did. You have a right
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.680]  to question known liars. And that's the point. But what about the fact that four million people
[50:43.680 --> 50:48.320]  have already fled Venezuela in the last six months? And now millions are trying like zombie
[50:48.320 --> 50:54.240]  apocalypse to flee socialism into Brazil that has its own problems. Brazil is going the way
[50:54.240 --> 50:58.400]  of Trump in their election. So they're trying to ban free speech. I mean, this is crazy.
[50:59.760 --> 51:04.640]  Yep. It's a disturbing pattern. And you know what they say the left says to that, right? They go,
[51:04.640 --> 51:12.160]  no, no, no, no. Venezuela, Cuba, Russia, China, Cambodia, North Korea, none of that is the kind
[51:12.160 --> 51:19.120]  of socialism I want. I want Finland. I want Norway. I want all these Northern European countries.
[51:19.120 --> 51:24.160]  And you go, they're on the way down. They're using the money they had when they were free market.
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.840]  And they're literally spending their grandparents and their parents' money. So that's not a model
[51:29.840 --> 51:36.480]  we want to mimic. And this whole idea of socialism being the future of the Democratic
[51:36.480 --> 51:43.760]  Party, which many Democratic politicians will proudly say, is the end of America.
[51:43.760 --> 51:48.800]  And the thing that scares me about that is they don't just want to change America,
[51:48.800 --> 51:53.520]  like the classical liberals wanted to alter some bad things. And I think they were wrong.
[51:53.520 --> 51:57.760]  But at least they had a plan. This is just, let's burn it to the ground. They don't want to debate.
[51:57.760 --> 52:01.840]  They don't want the truth to come out. They don't want to, they don't want to, you know,
[52:01.840 --> 52:07.280]  get to the, to something that's more a meritocracy. They just want to destroy everything.
[52:07.280 --> 52:11.520]  They want to burn your house. And if they die too, that's fine. They don't care. Like Bill
[52:11.520 --> 52:16.880]  Marr says, let's destroy the economy so we can get rid of Trump. That's right. Gavin,
[52:16.880 --> 52:22.320]  let me ask you this question. Alexandria Cortez, everyone she endorsed lost in primaries to
[52:22.320 --> 52:26.640]  other Democrats. All the Democrats so far have lost these special elections last night.
[52:27.280 --> 52:31.680]  I think this is going to send them into even more shrill, like you said, obsessed,
[52:31.680 --> 52:38.640]  crazy old girlfriend, fatal attraction mode. Yeah, it really is. And the other thing they
[52:38.640 --> 52:44.480]  don't get is that no one agrees with them. Millennials love socialism because they never got a paycheck
[52:44.480 --> 52:47.920]  and they didn't see how much to take out. Remember your first paycheck when you're working at the
[52:47.920 --> 52:53.920]  gas station and you get it back and you go, what? They're taking that much out of every single check?
[52:53.920 --> 52:57.760]  Where is it going? And you're in the lowest tax bracket and they're taking a third out of it.
[52:58.880 --> 53:05.280]  Yes. Yeah, my, the amount of tax I pay has been going up every year my entire life. And I can't
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.520]  take it anymore. I'm mad. Well, I've gone to big tax lawyers and top ones and they go, listen,
[53:09.520 --> 53:13.840]  Alex, you know the amount of money you have isn't that much anyways. You can't do stuff offshore.
[53:13.840 --> 53:17.360]  All the big boys are allowed to, all the elites go to the special law firms
[53:17.360 --> 53:21.840]  that are run by former attorney generals and then they all pay zero tax. That's part of the elite
[53:21.840 --> 53:28.880]  club and they all go offshore like Bezos and Tim Cook. These people admittedly almost pay no taxes
[53:28.880 --> 53:32.880]  but they lobby all day to raise taxes on people like you and me. You have to try to open a company,
[53:32.880 --> 53:37.840]  have a restaurant, a car dealership. You got 50, 60, 70 employees. The way they do all the stuff
[53:37.840 --> 53:44.480]  now, getting rid of the loopholes, I pay federally 50%. So I'm trying to bring all this money in
[53:44.480 --> 53:48.800]  constantly, you know, and they're calling it profit when I'm buying infrastructure. It's
[53:48.800 --> 53:55.200]  total screw job. People don't know. And America knows that. Middle America fly over states everywhere
[53:55.200 --> 54:01.760]  outside of New York and LA and we just saw in Ohio. Middle America understands that jobs are really
[54:01.760 --> 54:08.480]  the only thing that matters and Trump is providing jobs. So they're scared because they're scared
[54:08.480 --> 54:14.000]  that you and I and Trump are making the right seem a lot more attractive, a lot more fun.
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.880]  We have more millennials identifying as right wing than ever before, or at least not since the early
[54:18.880 --> 54:23.760]  80s. And Generation Z. That was my next question. Your proud boys, great patriots, they call them
[54:23.760 --> 54:28.560]  white supremacists, about a third of them are big handsome black guys and Hispanic folks.
[54:28.560 --> 54:33.680]  But what was going on? Like the poor little Hispanic guy who has a neurological disorder,
[54:33.680 --> 54:37.920]  they beat him up in Berkeley. He's fought back and kicked their ass. He knows he's on a walker.
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.120]  I mean, these are the images they can't stand. And those are all the videos I think were the
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.720]  last straw that had millions of views despite their shadow ban on our Facebook and our YouTube
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.960]  fan pages. So they panic when we had four reporters covering the event in Portland, the event in
[54:52.960 --> 54:58.160]  Berkeley where thousands showed up. The only antifa got arrested. They were such scum. And when
[54:58.160 --> 55:05.120]  your crowd and the prayer vigil crowd was more diverse, probably about demographically,
[55:05.120 --> 55:10.800]  was more diverse, 15% black, about 20, 30% Hispanic. And they were all hugging each other
[55:10.800 --> 55:14.880]  and loving each other. This, I think, sent them into conniption fits in the poll show it.
[55:14.880 --> 55:18.240]  Double the number of Hispanics in African Americans are supporting
[55:18.880 --> 55:22.960]  Trump and Republicans than they were just six months ago. This is a landslide. I don't know
[55:22.960 --> 55:28.080]  what they're going to do. Yeah, they hate that their pet blacks have left the plantation.
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.680]  And you'll notice they don't talk about David Duke or Richard Spencer or avowed white nationalists.
[55:33.680 --> 55:39.280]  They throw that around at people like you and me because they know it's not true and they have to
[55:39.280 --> 55:44.720]  do something to sink us because they know we have this massive appeal. They know we're funny.
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.720]  They know where you had the tinfoil hat on your head. You're being hilarious.
[55:48.720 --> 55:53.920]  But they go, I can't show that. I have to push the big lie and get these people out.
[55:53.920 --> 55:57.840]  Like, you know, it's a great example of all this bullshit propaganda. Excuse my language.
[55:57.840 --> 56:05.760]  Dinesh D'Souza, he has 0% critics rating on rotten tomatoes and 90% audience rating. I mean,
[56:05.760 --> 56:11.200]  doesn't that sum up the massive agenda the left has? Say that again. Say that again.
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.680]  The little imperiums, you know, who give fake ratings, whoever pays them, that's well known
[56:15.680 --> 56:21.360]  for terrible movies. The people, the establishment has a total negative rating for
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.040]  D'Souza's amazing film, but the public's 90%. It shows the fraud.
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.040]  It's a massive giant gap. And Charles Murray talked about this in coming apart.
[56:31.040 --> 56:36.240]  We have a massive gap now between the elites and the Midwest. And at least,
[56:36.240 --> 56:40.560]  you know, at least the monocle wearing elites of the past, they knew they were distant.
[56:40.560 --> 56:44.080]  They had their top hats and they had their scented anchorages they put on their face
[56:44.080 --> 56:48.960]  when they walked by the poor. These dummies, these rich elites at CNN and the globalist,
[56:48.960 --> 56:55.040]  they actually think they understand middle America and they are in touch with what we want.
[56:55.040 --> 57:00.240]  No, we don't think of speeches tear. We don't care. You talk about hate speech,
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.000]  like they say free speech is good, but it doesn't include hate speech. It includes everything,
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.360]  dummy. We don't want rules. We want total freedom. And the more you push these rules
[57:09.360 --> 57:14.320]  and regulations, the more you ostracize young and a great example is what just happened in
[57:14.320 --> 57:20.480]  full wars. Number one app, period in news on both Apple and Android and CNN is freaking out,
[57:20.480 --> 57:23.920]  saying, remove us. How obvious is that? We're back with five more minutes. Well,
[57:23.920 --> 57:27.360]  Gavin McGinnis, we have other special guests joining us. He's the host of get off my lawn.
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.360]  It's great. My son watches it. His whole school watches it, which scares the hell out of the
[57:31.360 --> 57:36.720]  left. I mean, took my daughters to camp this year. Yeah, ages 14 and 10 and like a third of the
[57:36.720 --> 57:42.560]  a third of the trunks had like gab McGinnis stickers or or Stephen Crowder stickers or
[57:42.560 --> 57:48.320]  info or stickers. I mean, the left is scared. We'll be right back info wars.com, news wars.com,
[57:48.320 --> 57:57.120]  spread those links. Years ago, info wars life created the powerful Michael ZX formula to

[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.280]  and the great work he does on get off my lawn. It's on his show yesterday. All the great work
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.240]  they're doing over there and just all the talent they've got is amazing. Makes me feel good to
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.120]  know there's other good people out there like brudge report.com and Dr. Savage having understand
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.960]  defended First Amendment. But since we mentioned this, let's play Candace Owens and her sidekick
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.880]  there from the great folks at turning point USA. And they're just having food to cafe in Philadelphia
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:45.520]  after giving a speech. And this is what little white twits do to feel good. They found Nazi
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.040]  sympathizers. They're like the French resistance. And so they're going to get them. Here it is.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:01:00.960]  All because we're eating breakfast and we have to be conservative. Have a wonderful day.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:19.360]  Enjoy your capitalist breakfast.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:43.360]  What's up with that big government?
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.560]  If you're a radio listener, which I always have to remember, we're mainly radio.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.880]  You know, trying to censor us. The radio is like the real power of this broadcast. It's still there.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.520]  It's wonderful. It's big. Tell folks about stations. You've got a bunch of skinny Jean
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.560]  people with their $800 iPhones sitting there having their coming of age thing sticking
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.320]  megaphones in a black woman, a smart good looking black woman. I think Candace Owens is super sexy
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.600]  if I wasn't married. And they're in her face and she's pushing the thing out of their face to try
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.040]  to blow her eardrums out. And they're all these skinny Jean yuppies running around calling her
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.800]  by Nazi's bullhorns in their face, which should blow your eardrums out calling. So, so this is
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.960]  just bizarro, but this is what it's like everywhere. Gavin, I know, but when they try to hit you,
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.280]  you actually hit back. Where do you think this is all going?
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:45.280]  A civil war riots, a giant Ferguson from coast to coast, every major city on fire after the
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.960]  election. We've already seen traces of that. That's right. You think you think when when we
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.160]  win these midterms, they're going to go ape without a doubt, without a doubt. Listen to them.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.640]  F the bourgeoisie to know who's to blame for all of this brainwashing is academia. These kids get
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.240]  pushed Marxism from kindergarten up. But when they hit college, it goes full board. I was talking
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:15.200]  to Michael Rectamwald, who is called anti PC professor. And he's suing NYU right now. And he
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.720]  was telling me that when the first year when they start out, there is a bit of variety. There's like
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:28.400]  50, 50, right, left kind of Marxist. And then year two, you start seeing it 70, 30. By the end of it,
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:36.960]  there's only maybe 5 to 10% would dare stray from the far left orthodoxy. And within that 95% that
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:44.560]  is far left, there are half of them extreme, full on communist radicals that want to burn
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.760]  mansions to the ground and take over the country with what like they don't talk about
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:55.200]  talk about socials in these kids. They have a quote. They say full communism. By the way,
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.040]  I want to get that professor on. He's the one that talks about leftist don't lecture me about
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.800]  how you're high and mighty. You're the biggest killers in history. I want to get him on because
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:09.040]  we've got to launch a counter offensive. This is the counter offensive. I just hope Trump gets
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.240]  really really pushy here because when he said something to Twitter, they backed off. He needs
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.440]  to say it to Google. He needs to say it to everybody else. I've got a report to him. Don't
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.360]  you agree that we have to get the Republican Congress and everybody right now to make this
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.440]  a campaign issue and tell the tech giant, stop it now. Yes, there's collusion going on here,
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.600]  but it's not Russia. It's big tech and big business and the government. So the government
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.320]  has to undo this. I mean, this is corruption from top to bottom. And they have to say,
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:42.320]  we don't let big business and big government work together because that's called fascism.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.880]  It is Gavin McGinnis. You're on fire. Great work there with get off my lawn at CRTV.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.520]  We got some of your boys coming on. Rufio Panman coming up and Will Johnson straight ahead.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.440]  Thank you so much, Gavin. Thanks for having me. That was good. We'll be back.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.400]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.720]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:18.240]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean,
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:24.080]  I cannot say it any clear. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.600]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.880]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine. And you cannot beat that for
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.280]  children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my dad,
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:43.600]  the colloidal silver and iodine as well. infowarslife.com or triple A-253-3139.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.920]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.920]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies. And that's who they are,
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.440]  and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:06.320]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:12.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:28.880]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.840]  You know, the communists have taken the symbol the last 150 years of clench fish. No, that's our
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:39.200]  symbol. We're not looking for a fight, but if you came to want to have one, you're going to get one
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.680]  politically, economically and physically. We don't start fights, but we finish them. And I got to
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.280]  tell you, beautiful things are happening right now. And I expected to be attacked. I expected to be
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.360]  banned. I saw them softening me up, getting me ready as the beta test. I'm not important enough to
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:59.200]  have a thousand articles a day, on average, the last year and a half lying about me and my family,
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.680]  and I mean, trying to destroy my life. New York Times reporters stalking me for years on end,
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:09.120]  Buzzfeed, Soros people. I mean, let me tell you something. I don't get into all this because it's
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.560]  James Bondi and it's crazy. And it doesn't intimidate me. It makes me use the energy
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.320]  because I realize if we lose, they win. And so it's not like I have a death wish or something.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.920]  It's the opposite. The death wish would be if I wanted them to control things and run things,
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:29.120]  it'd be like giving up. And my soul only feels good when I'm opposing these people. And let me tell
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:35.360]  you, my soul feels good when we've got folks like Will Johnson of UnitedAmericaFirst.com.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:43.360]  And I sat there for hours on Saturday and hours on Sunday, hearing him speak in the live feeds
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.320]  and then doing these big feeds we did here before we're banned on Facebook and everywhere.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.400]  It turned out hundreds of thousands watching live and millions watched it total.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:57.040]  Of him and Owen Schreuer and the rest of the great patriots out there just in a love fest
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.440]  for freedom, for free speech, 20 plus Antifa arrested for crimes. No patriots arrested.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:10.000]  And seeing Hispanic and black and white and Asian Americans and women all together loving America
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:16.880]  and articulate and even if somebody had muscle dystrophy and he was on a walker and got beat
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:22.160]  up with a Hispanic guy who fought back, he was a beautiful person. And just the light in their
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.200]  eyes, they're so alive. And let me tell you something, the Antifa and the left, I knew, I said Sunday,
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.200]  I looked at Rob doing, I said, they're going to ban us for this. And he goes, what do you mean?
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.200]  We're all big. I said, this is just too good. I mean, the nastiness of the other side and this
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.880]  and the fact that they can't shut us down. And I said, and the Republicans are going to win
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.120]  these special elections next next Tuesday. It's just, but it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.880]  And when they saw all those diverse people but unified by America and freedom and Christianity
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.480]  and the light in their eyes, they crapped a brick. And so people are like, oh, you're getting
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.920]  persecuted, you're getting kicked off everything. I have faith in God, but I've been fired before
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:07.360]  when I wouldn't sell out and wouldn't lie. So selling my soul out ain't happening.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.480]  When my soul feels good about something, I follow that. When it feels bad, I get away from it.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.960]  And I feel good doing this and watching Will Johnson and others made me feel so good.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.000]  And then when they've done all this and lied about me, I mean, they're following me all the
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.280]  time, but I leave here, I'll be followed. I'm stalked constantly. Just once, you know, we're
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.320]  dealing with criminals who have a will to dominate us. They lust after running our lives. Real men
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.920]  and women who love God and have their own life, they don't want to run their own lives. They got,
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.080]  I mean, they don't want to run your life. They're busy with their own lives.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.440]  So Will Johnson, I want to salute you while all this is happening. I just got to say,
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.400]  great job. We'll get your take on what's happening. What happened this weekend?
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.840]  You know, we've got the crew back. We're uploading HD videos to Twitter. We're going to start up
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.720]  every day saying the info wars.com censored video list on our own server on info wars.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.240]  So everybody can grab it. It's free to air copyright free. There'll be a message at the
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:00.240]  end. This is free to use wherever you are. And Rufio, we're getting Rufio on here in a minute
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.160]  as well. We just got him lined up for this segment and the next and then a little bit more
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.600]  into the next or hopefully the whole hour. Rufio obviously out there when they attack
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.160]  him, he just with precision takes them out. But this point we're at where we launched at
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.440]  three weeks ago, info wars official. And it was at the top 40 in the first two weeks.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.440]  So we have a big audience. It went to number one in news today. And what is CNN doing saying,
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:33.680]  ban him, ban him? How villainous can it get here? Will Johnson of UnitedAmericanfirst.com.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:40.000]  And of course, Rufio Panman, we're going to next with you, Rufio Panman on Twitter for now.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.560]  What do you make of this historic timer in my brother? I think we are winning. And see,
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.640]  I think that's the main reason why they want to shut you down as much as possible,
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.160]  because we are winning. They know for a fact that because we expose
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.920]  Antifa in the left for the hateful stuff that they were doing, that they knew you would be
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.400]  talking about it. See the mainstream media, they're not saying anything about it because there were
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.720]  no people that are Trump supporters, patriots that were arrested, that were causing any violence.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.920]  So we couldn't give them anything that they wanted. So they knew that you would expose the truth.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.600]  So they want to shut you down because they know so many people pay attention to info wars. So
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.800]  they had to do everything they can to shut it down. But see, I personally, I think it's going
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.960]  to backfire on them. So many people are waking up to what they did to info wars to Alex Jones,
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.040]  that it's going to it's waking people up like never before. And it's going to just bring a
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.160]  storm to them. I've talked to multiple people, they say, you know, I really don't agree with
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:53.200]  Alex Jones on everything that he says, but them banning him the way that they did was completely,
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.280]  ultimately out of place. And they said, you know what, I'm they're picking up, they went to the
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.520]  app. They said, I'm going to get the app because I want to see what he has to say. Multiple people
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.200]  said, Will, have you got the app? Have you got the app? I said, yes, of course I have the app.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.200]  But so many people, they said what they're doing to info wars is just taking it to another level.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.600]  And it's beyond belief. It's like living in Nazi Germany. They are literally doing book burning
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.800]  with digital books. And info wars is the their pilot program to see if they can do it to shut
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.120]  people up and see how many people going to cry about it. I agree with you. And my concern is
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.320]  I literally got tears in my eyes watching these rallies and the police who'd been helping them
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.560]  in both places finally did the right thing, arrested them, put their names out because
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.880]  they dox the police. Well, your name's going out there. And I think that also freaked them out
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.360]  that even in their blue city strongholds, where we know they've been ordered to help Antifa,
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.520]  the police are finally going, No, we're not doing it. Yeah, exactly. You know what? I have to give
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.200]  credit to the Portland police. They did a phenomenal job by keeping the Antifa. No, I agree. But I'm
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:10.480]  saying the last two times they didn't. So I'm saying the exact. Yes. Yeah, exactly. You know,
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:15.920]  and this time they did, but they wanted to come and harm us. You know, there was reports that they
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.400]  were actually shooting marbles over the police officers at us because they get because they
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.280]  could not get to us. So they kept going, kept going. And then all of a sudden the police department
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.280]  started throwing flashbangs at them because they were getting so frustrated because they
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:35.040]  could not harm us. Have you ever noticed every time the left has a rally or a march or a gathering
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.080]  that you never, ever hear about conservatives showing up throwing explosives at them, trying
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.040]  to hit them with rocks, trying to hit them with sticks, throwing bottles with urine and feces
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:50.880]  in it. You never hear about it. It's only when we have a rally that these leftists show up to try
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.240]  to harm us. Where's the media on that? How come the media doesn't tell the truth on that? People
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.040]  should really ask that question. Why doesn't it happen that way? Then they always try to bring
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.800]  up Charlottesville. They always try to bring up Charlottesville, but even Charlottesville was not
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.480]  supposedly a leftist rally. You're right. We're going to go to Brighton and come back with you in
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.160]  a few minutes and with Rufio. We're confident, but I don't want to be too confident. You see
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.840]  Stelter saying Trump's being violent to the media saying they're liars. CNN's calling for all of us
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.840]  to be shut down. He's calling for no free speech. He wants info. It's completely banned. All of them
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.440]  do it. CNN, they want our app banned because we're having, they've been up for years. We already have
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.160]  more than them in three weeks. That's so ridiculous. They don't want us on the field. They don't want
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.200]  our race car on the track. They don't want us in the ring. They, they, they, they're archetypal
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.400]  criminal scumbag wimps, but they keep hyping that somebody's going to attack the media,
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.320]  somebody's going to attack the media. And I really think in my gut, that's the only card
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.560]  they got left is to wind up some loon to attack them, to make them the victims when they're the
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.840]  ones actually calling for violence. Right. They're screaming that someone's going to attack the media.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:03.600]  Aren't they attacking you? Is this not attack on info wars? How is this not an attack? Call
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.920]  me a Nazi. Call me a Nazi. Yes. What are you saying? It's so bad that they have to ban you.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.920]  They're not saying anything. That's not true. They are afraid of you. They're afraid of you
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.320]  because here it is. You're talking to a black male that has nothing against you. You have nothing
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.280]  against me. They don't want that narrative. They want you to be a white supremacist because you're
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.760]  not exactly the leftist for all these Vanderbilt's like Anderson Cooper. They're totally uncomfortable
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.680]  around everybody. We're just real people. The chemistry is there. They know it. And they're
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.200]  afraid of the chemistry with all of us. It's just one freedom. We just want the American dream. We
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.560]  want freedom. We don't want to live in Venezuela. We want freedom. We don't want to be racist.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.720]  Stop telling us we're racist all day. Stop turning us to communist. We'll be back with
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.320]  Rufio to give his take on this and more will Johnson. We're going to open the phones up
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.960]  in about 15 minutes. So you talk both to these heroes and they are a lot of courage standing up
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.680]  10 to one before this last rally. We outnumbered them and that's why they're scared. This is

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:16.800]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:22.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Hollywood is killing itself. They've had the
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:28.320]  Hollywood screen actors, you'll vote to remove Trump's star officially, replaced with Kerry
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:34.160]  Fisher. Who wants to be on your dirty Hollywood, you know, homeless feces, needles everywhere,
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.360]  but they kept attacking it and attacking it. So the West Hollywood city council
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.080]  has been asked, he voted to ask Hollywood chapter of commerce to remove Donald Trump's star from
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:48.000]  the Hollywood fame. At least there's a chance somebody's going to impeach his star. Wow,
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.840]  that's a bet Miller. These people are disconnected jokes. And we are joined by the great will
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:58.240]  Johnson of United America first dot com and Rufio panman, who again gets attacked over and over
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:03.280]  again two, three, four to one, the guys with metal batons and the defense himself in flawless victory
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:10.480]  knockouts. Mike siren, which is coming up. We've also got Vox day coming on to get into all this.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.880]  So I wanted to go to a panman and also will Johnson jump in any time. This is just a crazy,
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:22.480]  crazy time to be alive. And I think what happened out there this weekend is one reason we've been
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:27.360]  banned. I think our multicam coverage of it, but Rufio, give us your take just on the state of
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.360]  the world, the special elections with the Republicans just one again, where you think all
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.960]  this is going, what you think the commies and Soros funding them are going to do next.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:44.080]  Well, it's interesting after this last weekend seeing how it almost seems like the attacks
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.200]  verbally have kind of quieted down because there's not there's not very much they can say. They've
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:55.120]  just kind of been attacking platforms like yours. There's a lot of people that have been getting
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:01.520]  their Facebook accounts shut down and stuff like that. So it's kind of gone from the verbal attacks
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:07.520]  and trying to convince everybody and push the narrative to just straight out shutting down
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:14.400]  the anybody who's right at Bernie Sanders pretty much. So where I see things going is
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.600]  you're going to start seeing a lot more people like the Patriots show up like last weekend
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.840]  and it's just not going to get reported. And so we start just showing up to these news outlets
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:32.560]  and demanding that they start accurately representing what's going on. I just love how
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.480]  months ago to recap the story, they beat up women and children and nobody was there for a little
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.560]  prayer event. They won't even let Christian conservatives, anybody go out in public.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:47.200]  And then you guys came a minority of you, they attacked, you drove them off. But numbers wise,
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:53.040]  it looked to me like you guys had bigger numbers than the commies. Is that accurate or what happened?
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.640]  What are the numbers estimated in Portland? What are the numbers estimated in Berkeley?
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.080]  You know, the numbers in Portland were, I've never seen anything like it before. It was probably one
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:09.360]  of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I mean, we waited pretty much all day just waiting
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:16.080]  for more bus loads of people to come in. And I think that the opposing side felt good at first
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:23.520]  until they started to see that we were just continually busing people in. And, you know,
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:27.680]  that's a huge, that's a huge message. I mean, that's pretty much, you know, Joey's mission,
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.680]  to just keep having these rallies and keeping persisting. And obviously the optics from the 30th,
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.800]  you know, is pretty much why all those people came out. I mean, we had them from all over the
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:44.480]  place, New York. And I mean, there's probably boys along. We had just about every state represented
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:51.200]  it seemed like. But as far as Berkeley numbers go, it looked like it was pretty thick there as well.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.640]  I know that they have. That's right. You were there. You guys weren't at the other one. You were
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:02.400]  another event. Let me ask you that question then. What do you think they're going to do next? Like
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.840]  you said, they've gone underground now and their daddy's back at the big San Francisco run tech
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:15.200]  companies, the imperial elite, the cultural elite as WikiLeaks called it. What are they going to do
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:22.480]  now? Well, I think they're going to, I think Antifa on their street level is going to keep
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.360]  trying to find any weakness they can. And they're going to kind of, they're going to attack us
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:33.840]  whenever they can. But I think they're going to start, they're going to really push to shut down
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:40.880]  all of our platforms, shut down our voice any way they can. And, you know, obviously with you,
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.480]  you're going through that right now. But, you know, the Patriots are really strong. So I don't
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:51.200]  want to have a sense of doubt as far as what we're capable of, but it's going to be a little bit,
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.120]  it's going to be difficult at first, I think. What about the Streisand effect? I mean, I see
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.720]  this will Johnson really blowing up at their face. They're complete concerted banning of me,
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.800]  particularly, I think is to set the precedent for everybody else. I don't think I'm that important.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.840]  I think they're getting ready. Well, they've set it to move on everybody. They're already moving
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.760]  on everybody. What do you think Trump and the Congress needs to do? You know what? I did a video
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:21.120]  asking for President Trump to step in and to bring awareness of what's actually happening here.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:27.120]  This is digital book burning, just like Nazi Germany all over again. And, you know, important,
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:33.440]  I think the numbers were like 1500 plus on our side. It was at least close to 2000 people.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:40.160]  In Berkeley, there was only about 30, maybe 50 of us as a stretch, but we still held them off because
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.680]  actually the police department did a beautiful job. But I truly believe that Trump and Congress
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.360]  need to do something. This is absolutely discrimination against you. And the reason
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.240]  why they're doing it against you, because you're a white male, because you're a Christian,
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.800]  because you believe in God and because you believe in the truth, they are attacking you.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.880]  See, they find it that white people are soft targets. That's the reason why they go after
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.280]  white people because they know for a fact that white people, for most part, don't say anything.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.720]  They don't speak out, but you do. And they don't like the fact that you speak out. And for me to
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.840]  come on here and acknowledge that there's a war on white people in America, this just proves it.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.040]  This just proves it. Them attacking you the way they're attacking you absolutely proves
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.200]  that there's an attack on white people in America. And a lot of people don't even want to acknowledge
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.000]  it, but it's actually they're attacking capitalism. They're trying to get white people to be even more
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.400]  captive, beaten to submit. Like you say, there's a war on everybody, but particularly you do have
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.480]  the New York Times and all these people, they say, oh, she can say whites are subhuman. This is
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.400]  literally Adolf Hitler stuff just reversed. And this is what the left, just like St. Candice Owens
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:52.480]  supports Nazis and is a Nazi screaming at her. This is insane. Yes, absolutely. I mean,
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:58.560]  you had Nancy Pelosi call me a white supremacist. These people have lost any brain cells that they
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.040]  had remaining. You know, I like to say that they have marbles routing around in the head and the
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:10.560]  few that they have is just rallying around. I mean, so these leftists, they do not care about
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.200]  the American people with when they don't care about truth, they don't care about freedom of speech.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.160]  Can you imagine had Hillary Clinton won? Do you think they would be trying to ban you then?
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.840]  Do you think they'll be trying to shut you down then? Do you think they'll be blaming Russia then?
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.600]  Do you think they'll be doing all these attacks on the president of the United States? No,
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.240]  absolutely not because they're not getting what they want. They're trying to do everything they
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.520]  can and mainly because this is the midterm election year. This is the most important election,
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:43.200]  midterm election in American history. If you ask me, if you ask me and they know it,
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.600]  that's why they want to shut you down now because before November come, because if they
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:53.600]  can't have you speaking out, they can't have you waking people up. They can't have you getting people
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:59.840]  to be more proactive in America. Never before have you ever seen so many conservatives step
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.920]  out in the street in Portland or any place else like you did this past year. That's right,
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.880]  conservatives never get out in the street. I think that's what scares them. I'll come back and talk
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:12.480]  to both of you about that, but the iconography, the imagery of a good-looking, strong crowd of people
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:17.280]  of every color, all humans, red blood standing up for America and then how scummy and evil their
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:22.800]  people are. This really shows what the establishment has got and the type of people they have and the
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:28.320]  fact that your crowds were more multiracial than their crowds absolutely panicked. And we'll talk
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.880]  about that with Rufio Panman at Rufio Panman for now on Twitter and Will Johnston on America
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:39.760]  first.com. Alex Jones with infowars.com. Our app launched three weeks ago in news is number one in

[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.520]  call us the Nazis. Give me a break. I tell you, this is historic just like Martin Luther King
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.880]  marching in Selma. Lincoln was elected to United Nation for the first time. The left tried to smear
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.680]  him and went to war with him. Can President Trump and we come together and save America a second
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:09.920]  time? Death of a Nation is the latest film from number one New York Times best-selling author

[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:31.760]  My dad and I'm out bragging as I didn't do it in Machiavelli all straight shot when I did it.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.760]  I never threatened Mueller. I said I meant politically high noon spaghetti western music
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:40.560]  we're gonna take him out this is you know the showdown I'm not backing down they said that was
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.480]  violence when the ones called for violence but I knew it my dad came over the next day to my house
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:50.960]  he goes why'd you do that I said why do you think I did it he said you're pushing him to ban you
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.040]  ahead of when they're planning to do it right for the election you want to trigger a big debate
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.680]  about this if I said yep I'm your son you know me don't you he said yeah I think you're gonna I
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.000]  think it's gonna I think it's gonna work but that's the Holy Spirit folks and I don't want to get
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.640]  weird on people here I'm 44 about to be 45 and I've learned to go with my gut go with my spirit
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.720]  when I listen to it everything turns out well when I don't things get bad and they were already
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.120]  banned as they'd already shadow banned as they'd already do it to everybody else so we had to push
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:27.040]  them and I know Project Veritas and others have gotten into the Washington Post and New York Times
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.880]  they're really upset that's coming out they don't want us to magnify that they're they don't want
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.040]  Dinesh D'Souza's film getting promoted here we've got internal stuff that will come out soon why
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.760]  they're freaked out because there are people in Google and these other platforms that are starting
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:46.480]  to blow the whistle because what they're hearing is so evil and so out of control and so bad I took
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.960]  my wife to see this over the weekend uh definition and when you if studied history like I have the
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:58.880]  movie is so accurate that I I don't normally get tears of my eyes during a movie but I my wife
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.960]  looked over and I had tears streaming down my face five or six times and it was only because
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.240]  it wasn't even tears of pain or even joy it was tears of thank god this is out and then when he
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.640]  exposed Soros there's a Nazi at the end well I know for a fact man they have told me that's
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.840]  why they're coming after me that's one of the big reasons it just felt so good to know there were
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.640]  other people that weren't cowards and to see it just it was I don't want to give the whole movie away
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.760]  but you know that they don't show it in most liberal theaters around the country they're trying
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.760]  to block it and it's an amazing time it's pretty before I go back to Rufio and Will Johnson and
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.640]  talk about this you know this big fight that's coming if you don't financially support us that's
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.080]  the other part of the equation they will shut us down we can beat these lawsuits Soros is financing
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:41.360]  we've been beating some of them but it's very expensive to get the right lawyers to actually

[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:29.280]  hammer but coming up next segment i'm gonna with our guest i'm gonna get into ingram defense
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:35.120]  info wars coordinated purge of sources we trust and like and so it's a big report up on info wars.com
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:39.920]  the fact that tucker carlson the fact that michael savage the fact that even the daily mail gets
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.960]  what's happening this is a big deal and a big moment they always use that photo shop weird photo
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.600]  i mean it didn't even look like me but they love it somebody says use that photo so going back
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.920]  to rufio panman from the proud boys and gab mcgannis was on earlier and will johnson just
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:01.920]  other points you guys want to make after this question the symbolism of people not starting
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:08.560]  to fight picking up their bubblegum wrappers no problems being nice to the police coming in leaving
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.760]  things the way they were and people attacking police crapping on the ground yelling and screaming
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:19.760]  obscenities getting arrested everywhere well this is the deranged left uh rufio panman why
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.560]  why are they such scum why are they such art type old trash who the hell are these people
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:34.320]  um well i think i think it's an accumulation of everybody who um has never wanted to abide by any
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:41.440]  rules never really wanted to accomplish anything for themselves and um you know it that's just
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:47.920]  kind of what embodies extreme leftists and antifa um it's really hard to to characterize who they are
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.880]  it's just because it's so inhuman almost the way they're a bunch of lazy scum that tell us we are
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:39:00.640]  what they are right yeah so it's all name calling it's like kindergarten uh bullies really they don't
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  really have anything good to say even their chants are are uh very amateurish i guess you could say
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:14.320]  they're very uncreative and yeah it's not the answer to 1984 1776 and we humanity are awake and
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.880]  rising and freedom beats in the human breast and we will not be stopped yeah no it's racist go to
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:26.800]  hell yeah yeah yeah yeah me right yeah yeah exactly it's the same thing over and over again same
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.560]  message nothing new no actual leadership uh you never see their face no sense of responsibility
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.000]  you know it's just a bunch of garbage oh what about the ordinance now i'll come back to you in a
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.880]  moment let me ask will johnson what about the ordinance they can't wear mask after they attack
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:46.960]  the police and elderly and people that weren't even with the prayer vigil six months ago that you
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.920]  launched uh how did that affect them not be able to wear their mask they looked they looked like
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.840]  they were pissing their pants they were highly upset and i you know a lot of them came in with
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.600]  the mask on and then when they were standing with the mask on i'll have my megaphone and i
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.480]  would just get on the megaphone i would scream out officer officer he has on the mask has on the mask
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.080]  and i'll imagine when the police officer start walking towards them they have to pull them off
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.960]  and they were getting upset because i kept calling them out if you're not committing any crimes if
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.400]  you don't want to do something wrong and i get caught you typically put on a mask that's a clear
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.440]  indication that these people coming out here wanting to harm us i've had multiple people say that
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.640]  you should have these rallies i'm like why because people want to come out and harm you so you're
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.680]  basically saying that our freedom of speech should go away because we're we should be afraid
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.160]  that these people come out here with masks on wanting to harm us see antifa in berkeley there
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:44.960]  was a city ordinance where they cannot wear any mask and when they walked in with a mask the
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:50.480]  police department would not allow them to walk past their their brocade they could not get passed it
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:57.200]  so the city ordinance and another thing i shared this video with rob do where the city ordinance
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:03.760]  when you had antifa members and people for bam and etc show up these companies democratic socialists
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.440]  show up to the to the town hall that they had screaming and pleading with them to say allow
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.840]  antifa to have weapons and allow to antifa to have masks on so they can protect us from the neo
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:24.080]  nazis so last time i remember it was our event we didn't allow them to have masking's mask on
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.480]  we didn't ask them to even come but they wanted to come and wear masks and have weapons so that
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:35.760]  they can harm us this is the this is the norm from the love they want to harm people who respect
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:41.760]  the president and love this country what kind of world do we live in this is america it's crazy
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.560]  well that's it they're the bullies but now when they attack rufio and you guys tend to one they
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.560]  get their butts kicked now now rufio what's going to happen to them after this this seemed to really
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:57.440]  demoralize them uh well you know i don't know how many more uh how much more vandalism they have to
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.880]  do like that one clip they were just attacking that marine corps recruiting office i mean that's
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.640]  government property right there um they they're lucky that they didn't you know run into 10 marines
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:12.400]  that just bumped out of there and and beat their you know beat their butt um you know that was
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.520]  something i keep looking at is like how stupid you have to be to go and attack you know the marine
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:24.000]  corps office and the funny thing is we have a lot of uh military a lot of marines and the army and
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.560]  navy air force that show up to these rallies because this is what they signed up to do you
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.160]  know uh fight enemies for the domestic uh domestic and it's really cool to watch and come out and
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.480]  just come alive because this is like you know they're really truly defending america it's
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:42.480]  right let me ask you a question when we come back they knew it was sunday they knew it was saturday
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.600]  they attacked it and they actually have the intelligence files we've gotten that come up before
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.080]  they target and pick things where they won't meet opposition so i'd love to do that like you said
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:43:01.200]  like on a tuesday afternoon we'll be right back stay with us patrick in the great nation of australia
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.800]  you're on the air worldwide thanks for holding hey um i've been following you since i was 14 and
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:13.120]  i'm 32 now i remember back when info wars and prison planet it was just blue text on a white screen
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.920]  and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and i thought it was pretty cool and read
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:22.640]  all the books and seen all the dvds and followed all your guests and i've been using your products
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:28.480]  since the first iteration of survival shield and since then i'm on the x2 the super male vitality
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:34.640]  the caveman the real red pill micro zx body it's all amazing thank you brother yeah and i wanted to
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:40.640]  say that by following you so much it's like you're just detoxing the mind you're detoxing the body
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.000]  you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know god the more you fear god but the more
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.200]  you chase god and i wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you the crew and
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:44:01.280]  the listeners out there 1776 worldwide living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:06.800]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:13.200]  water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:19.680]  particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:26.560]  a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:32.240]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:38.720]  elixir pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:45.760]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:51.440]  the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:59.840]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it we knew it was coming the
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.360]  whole thing was for me leg first demonize him for wars lie about us build a straw man then
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:11.120]  sue us to add credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook with nebulous
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:18.480]  terms like bullying children and islamophobia and then wallah two weeks later ban info wars completely

[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:19.360]  i'll be honest with you i can look into the old crystal ball okay the old globalist
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.800]  got their finger on the trigger for me not just on internet bands
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.600]  the torpedoes i launched hit them a long time ago so they can always have their
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:37.200]  current victory if they want i chose this long time ago diane feinstein's chai com control
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:44.960]  she is a chinese communist agent it's all gonna come out and then there's a good seven or eight
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:49.920]  other senators that are on the payroll a lot of house members so you guys just had to keep
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:59.360]  pushing moeller and the rest of you so it's all gonna come out i told the new york times on
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:05.120]  friday that and boy i said watch for some big senators be supposed to shiny spies it all came
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:11.200]  out two days later they they crap their bridges man they hit the emergency line because i was
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.200]  hitting a lot of these top reporters a lot of them are operatives for the globalists let them know
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:22.080]  so they panic button and do what they did which they did i didn't like to them to give them a do
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.960]  it and i don't particularly like putting myself in this position but if i can call the gambit in
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:33.360]  the military or a pawn sacrifice if i can go out in reconnaissance operation and and and
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:37.760]  is a good chance i'm gonna get wiped out doing it but i draw their artillery fire to show where
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.440]  their emplacements are for the jets to come in and take them out well that's going to save
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.640]  thousands of people and if i get wiped out in the process if it's a war for my family and my
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:52.160]  children in the future i'm ready to be sent on that mission and i've told everybody i've volunteered
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:56.640]  for it i've done it that's what we're doing and these globalists just keep thinking of destroying
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.160]  me attacking me against me i consider myself dead already and i'm not trying to be fanciful about
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.720]  that they take me serious because they know now the public starting to get it this is not a game
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:12.320]  here folks uh rufio pam and the great work you're doing will johnson we salute you you guys have
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:18.160]  done a great job other points you want to make other angles you want to hit in closing rufio
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.160]  well you know a lot of people they uh they ask me you know why is that you continue to go out and
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:32.880]  do what you do and and sometimes you know after some of these rallies it's it's uh tempting to you
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:38.320]  know to maybe you may think maybe i should step back maybe i should just enjoy the summer with
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:45.680]  my family but then i'm immediately you know um i remember i immediately remember you know how much
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:50.400]  how much longer is it gonna be until this stuff shows up to my front door and to your front door
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.680]  and that's why i keep telling people i mean you know how much longer do we have if we don't fight back
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:01.440]  until this is you know out of control and uh as far as i can see on the streets and as far as i
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:07.120]  can see with what you're doing with you know we're not far um from that reality uh if we don't do

[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:57.680]  say in closing you know what i want to say hashtag free alex jones i started spreading it around
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:04.320]  hashtag free alex jones what they're doing is absolutely unbelievable and you know what as
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:08.960]  long as god keep putting breath in me i'm going to keep fighting for the truth and fighting for
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:13.440]  us right that's why i go out to these events a lot of people when i go out to these events
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:19.360]  they're afraid because they're afraid of what anti for blm and band's gonna do when you don't do
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:25.040]  anything is you end up in the situation that we're in right now for over the past 20 years we should
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:31.440]  have had americans step up especially when obama was in office in greater numbers than ever before
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.960]  to stop what is taking place they've already removed god from schools they removed god from
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:41.520]  the courthouses they removed god from public venues they removed god from your place of business
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:46.080]  they want to remove god from everything out of sight out of mind and but it's they've already
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:52.160]  done it but now is the time to try to reverse all that and thank god we have donald j trump as our
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:56.160]  president because he's doing so many positive things for everybody well exactly he brought the
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:00.560]  blessing of abraham back in and his inauguration he said we want the blessing we bring god back in
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:05.600]  he realized it was a ritual in 60 seconds why do they hate trump so much he's fulfilling his promises
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:12.080]  he's so truthful so they say he's a liar though they're the liars you know why they hate him because
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.840]  he's doing positive things look at the economy look at black people the employment for black people
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:23.600]  look at the appointment for hispanics look how he's what look how we're becoming respected as far as
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.160]  strength across the world and america right now and get back to that he's not doing the whole
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:32.080]  affirmative action or welfare to keep people under control he is directing factories though to
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:38.320]  minority areas and incentivizing being hired so people have a future well they can't stand the
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:43.200]  fact that he's doing positive things because people say you know what i have a job trump has not done
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:48.640]  anything that i disagree with and they hear people saying that an alarming rate and they can't have
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:54.960]  people like alex jones info wars pushing that message by the way they had 15 more democrats
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:59.200]  in the gallup and all those double the amount of black americans hispanic americans others
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:03.440]  supporting trump now than what it was just six months ago it's probably way worse than that one
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:08.400]  that's why they're freaking out so bad they're afraid you're absolutely right they're afraid
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:12.480]  how come they just can't change the channel how come you can't go look at a different news feed
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:19.360]  why is alex jones info wars so scary to them because american people are waking up and i want to
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.240]  and you're absolutely doing it no you're doing it brother we're in this together yes we're in this
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:30.400]  together but because because of platforms like yours is because of platforms like mine just to be
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:36.640]  honest and i give of course we all give god the glory but we have to do our part in this battle
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:41.120]  in the spiritual war well that's what's happened is you johnson they're scared of you you've taken
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.360]  action you already got them to admit that and it was terrorist by you having the prayer vigil
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:52.320]  with folks so we salute you we'll talk to you soon we love you and be safe thank you sir we've got uh
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.040]  uh mike sernovich and vox stay joining us next hour i need to get to this in this little segment
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:02.800]  part of the next uh laura ingram michael sabbage uh tucker carlson has come out in support of us
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.720]  matt rudge has been without drudge again it's just everybody we've got on the team without
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.640]  them we'd lose it's just like it's like you see how it's just like this in this folks it's like
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:18.320]  biblical and thank god people understand their line about me they demonize me first then they then
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.520]  they come after me and they think that people don't notice they're going to get everybody
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.880]  but now we're going to have a debate about censorship just like i wanted that's why i put
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:28.480]  myself in there i covered the censorship i covered what they were doing i knew they'd
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:32.960]  ban me for it but i knew it had to be done and it's just my my spirit keeps coming through
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.880]  here's the first of what ingram was saying last night about the attack on m4's and we'll come back
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:42.240]  with more of it the next segment here it is remember what facebook ceo marx zuckerberg told
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:49.120]  a senate hearing back in april there are certain content that clearly we do not allow right hate
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:56.400]  speech terrorist content um nudity anything that makes people feel unsafe in in the community
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:02.960]  from that perspective that's why we generally try to refer to what we do as a platform for all ideas
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:10.560]  a platform for all ideas really over the past few months facebook and other tech giants have
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:18.000]  given us ample reason to doubt that proclamation the latest example started early yesterday morning
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:24.240]  when apple pulled several podcasts associated with a controversial and often incendiary alex
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:31.120]  jones from the itunes store facebook followed suit unpublishing four of jones pages claiming
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:38.960]  the videos on those pages violated that hate speech policy hours later youtube decided it
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.080]  wasn't going to miss out on all that censorship fun and youtube suspended the alex jones channel
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.440]  with its 2.4 million subscribers stop right there we're gonna come back with more of this
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:54.160]  and it's not ingram's fault she's busy this is what they do they they they banned a few of our
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:58.720]  things the week before so that would be the story then they banned everything total de-platforming
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:04.560]  now they've gone after discuss that's just the comments so you can talk most a lot of it attacking
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:09.040]  me now they kick us off mail champs so we can't send emails to you because of the proper systems
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.320]  of all the laws then they're they're they're hitting all our server companies lying filing
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:20.960]  fake complaints that hey i got racist stuff or child porn or bank documents off this this this
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:26.320]  thing i should have opened the show up with that i mean they are trying to shut it all down
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:33.840]  we've gone from launching a new app three weeks ago was in the top 50 to going to number one on
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:40.320]  android and itunes it's now number one and cnn every hour i'm told i've seen three reports

[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:23.120]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:30.640]  and youtube suspended the alex jones channel with its 2.4 million subscribers oh it's easy
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:36.800]  to dismiss concerns about big text actions all coordinated it seems to shut down jones
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:43.360]  because of course he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories but this isn't about alex
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:50.880]  jones this is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:58.160]  trust and like if big tech can control the information flow then they can also perhaps
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:03.680]  even influence the outcome of the midterms and even future presidential elections
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:09.360]  so essentially alex jones has been deleted digitally de-platformed from from these websites
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:13.040]  you wonder if he'll have any influence going forward because these private companies
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.320]  do have an incredible amount of control over the internet and that's the point controlling
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:24.960]  who has a voice and who doesn't on these monster platforms is tantamount to limiting speech
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:30.240]  and as you'll see in a moment it's also a viewpoint discriminant notice that turd blossom
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.720]  brian stelter doesn't tell you like you didn't watch the days before that he's lobbying for us
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:41.200]  to be taken off he then goes oh my god they took him off oh it's just because here's the thing he
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:49.040]  can never tell the truth he's of his father let's continue it's also viewpoint discrimination
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:55.920]  back in february facebook launched a new algorithm that would cause top conservative pages
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:02.000]  to see a dramatic drop in traffic and this included personal pages by the way president
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:09.840]  trump's facebook page saw a 45 drop that paul notice i told you all this because we have
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:14.720]  the graphs internally they did a 50 drop after the election and then they've just been squeezing
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:20.240]  ever since so you don't notice continue said their content was similarly blocked on facebook
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:27.040]  facebook along with other social media sites have taken aggressive actions to silence conservative
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:32.160]  voices such as ourselves by deliberately making this big issue recognizing our page
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:39.360]  with algorithms that censor and suppress our free speech next it was youtube who let conservative
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:45.520]  influencers build up an audience for years only to end up limiting their channels temporarily
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:51.840]  pause back that up 10 seconds that's key everyone advertises on their big syndicated radio shows
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:56.160]  everyone advertises on their tv shows everyone advertises if your small business or in your
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:02.640]  newspaper mad ad for years you build them up you create the content you send people there
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:11.280]  they get it all built then they go some sjw said you were a nazi your 35 000 videos and two and a
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:16.720]  half billion views are gone and i'm like the only thing i really miss is like god there's
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:21.120]  some footage of my dog that's dead my grandma it's dead on there i should have saved that and
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:29.520]  downloaded it but i mean just the vandals these the anti-free speech monsters and then they
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:35.680]  sit there and act like we're the monsters when they're funded by a nazi collaborator this is
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:41.760]  it joins us tomorrow by the way the film is about the nazi soros ah you didn't shut that down did
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:48.640]  you my pretty continue next it was youtube who let conservative influencers build up an audience
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:55.840]  for years only to end up limiting their channels temporarily demonetizing them with no warning at
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:02.960]  all this has happened to conservative commentators like ben Shapiro dave rubin and denis prager
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:09.760]  for many on the left the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them prevent them from
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.960]  speaking just look at what's happened on to conservative speakers on college campuses
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.320]  and after a liberal radio host flocked on air america remember them well some democrats sought
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:28.560]  to revive the fairness doctrine to snuff out conservative talk radio thankfully that went
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:35.840]  nowhere but they'll come out with more and special guests but like sternovich uh vox day and others
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:40.480]  but it didn't flop they go up your sponsors they harass you they do all this crap the reason i know
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:46.000]  all about this is i've been enjoying it for 24 years i've been dealing with every level of
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.960]  censorship there is there's nothing like practice to make you a master and i know exactly every

[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:43.600]  to talk about how he was banned nine months ago on twitter now dorsi banned milo a couple years ago
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:48.720]  or during the campaign i guess about two years ago back in july of of 2016 so i guess two years ago
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:55.920]  now and now we've seen all this unfold and accelerate so why is jack dorsi now saying jones
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:00.000]  hasn't violated his rules is it like zuckerberg two weeks ago oh jones hadn't violated the rules
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:08.880]  then oh we did find he did is this some legalese game but i gotta tell you you've got cnn lobbying
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:18.000]  right now just type it in to search engine cnn delete jones's apps we launched a new app three
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.840]  weeks ago i figured this was coming and i said we got some old apps four five years old i said i
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:27.360]  want a big new badass app six months ago i said build it because i think they're gonna ban us
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:33.440]  and i think we can push an app to number one i foresaw this and they'll ban that too but the power
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:39.360]  to a jury of being number one and then just having your phone book address just how they get to you
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:44.240]  banned when you pay for it you you put it into the store we're now number one it what we were number
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:52.560]  three earlier we're now number one on news on android and on the whole apple itunes system
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:57.360]  now they've delisted us from itunes to get our podcast but the apps are still there so he launched
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:04.560]  this three weeks ago this all started a week ago it's now number one four point nine stars and

[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  four slash newsletter and we'll be getting to you soon mail chimp bandus discuss bandus more than
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:21.680]  15 platforms banned us well i've got lawyers saying no you have clear racketeering like top
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:26.400]  ones top you know like we're talking deans of law schools are calling saying okay we want the suit
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:30.560]  we can't believe they did this in the trump derangement syndrome the fact that they did all
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:35.440]  this so i want to ask box day you ride shotgun was the mike zernovich coming up what do you
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:40.320]  think's happening have they was this trump derangement syndrome i mean why are they getting so
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:44.720]  scared they just lost these special elections what are they doing because it seems like now
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:51.200]  they went too far they demonize me as a straw man to use me as the test case to ban certain people
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:56.560]  and de-platform them and unperson them that's now everyone's unifying against it now we're
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:02.160]  getting record traffic now they are crippling the sites and attacking us but we'll fix that i mean i
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:08.560]  really think they've misstepped again what do you think i think they're desperate i think that
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:15.840]  they know they're running out of time and they're taking whatever actions they can as quickly as
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:23.760]  possible in order to shut down the voices of the right that are most influential before the midterm
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:35.360]  elections i agree with you so so what comes next what comes next is the defunding first you have
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:42.080]  the de-platforming and then they're going to go after the monetization yeah they're going to go
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:51.120]  after payment processors credit card companies banks try to limit the ability of your supporters
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:57.760]  to provide you with money which is beyond racketeering i mean that's what the lawyers say
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.800]  this is so illegal but they're desperate they think they can pay out lawsuits the decision has been
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:09.440]  made even when they lose which they will so they're going to do this well there's no question i don't
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:17.280]  think that they have much choice because most of these companies are propped up on some level by
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:28.560]  the deep state if you look at the $600 million contract that the CIA gave to amazon what a lot
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:39.120]  of people don't realize is that twitter and facebook and google possibly have been benefiting
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:44.400]  from similar contracts they just were not as smart as jeff bezos well well let's go further yeah
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:49.360]  bezos well you know i mean i've been told by high-level former CIA section chiefs and i confirmed it
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:58.880]  google is nasa and some other agency so i mean yeah go ahead i'm not surprised but uh
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:08.000]  bezos did it openly yeah he's a he is a better businessman than these other guys and he's actually
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:16.640]  interested in business as well and and so that's why amazon doesn't leap into the banning and the
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:22.000]  the censoring with the same enthusiasm that the others do i agree with you so i mean we know that
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:29.440]  dorsi's part controlled by that why is dorsi saying no when he banned you well i think that
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:38.240]  that they're circling the drain your twitter went way too far too early if you think about it
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:45.040]  they were really the first to start this whole wave of banning you know uh they're so out of
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:51.920]  control that they didn't merely ban me they ended up banning my wife who's not political at all
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:58.560]  but she meant she still managed to get herself banned uh after getting into a discussion with
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:08.640]  some crazy vegan woman who was stalking her and so twitter i think is is trying to dig themselves
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.320]  out because they've lost so many users they've lost us you know so many accounts they don't
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:21.040]  have the growth anymore and unlike amazon and unlike apple they don't actually make any money
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:29.120]  so that's right and you get on something they've had the new york times and and and they had some
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:34.160]  people record them and they the washington post and buzzpeed and all the regular suspects calling
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:39.600]  people and they say we'll give you a big profile and say how great you are if you tell us bad things
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:44.720]  about alex jones and that's like a weird current today of god even though it's worthless and it's
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:50.880]  the same thing like oh even some vegan lady you're a leftist so you can get a woman banned
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:57.840]  there's no real money or or energy or energon cubes or no seeds or no you know pork steak or beef
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:05.360]  steak it's all just scalping someone the left is all now about power to control someone it is the
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:10.160]  most maniacal authoritarian thing i could imagine it's it's literally the art type of a villain
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.240]  well actually that's my pr plan you know i've i've had a lot of trouble with uh the new york times
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:24.480]  games and other mainstream media pieces doing hit pieces on me so i figure a few more appearances
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:29.440]  here on alex jones and then i'll be able to say hey look i've got all this dirt on alex jones
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:33.840]  maybe you should do a nice piece about me for a change but you know the weird thing about a nice
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:38.480]  piece i told politico right when rand paul won like four years ago i said you know how you'd beat
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:43.520]  rand paul is you would endorse him and they they laughed they put that in there they didn't get it
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.480]  like you know vox a new york times piece endorsing you would be the end of you but they can't even
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:53.120]  do it everything to get the macky valiant thing that if they endorsed us it would kill us they're
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:14:00.560]  so delusional man there's such follows yeah well i thought it was funny that they thought that anointing
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:08.960]  ben Shapiro and jordan peterson and sam harris as the official new york times approved opposition
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:15.200]  was somehow going to help those guys i mean even people who are fans of Shapiro and everyone
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:21.920]  turned against them when it became obvious exactly we're going to break here but then
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.520]  what comes next fox what are they going to do next what they're going to do next is they're
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:34.720]  going to uh go after the lesser lights you know i fully expect people like me people like jack
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:40.960]  posovic people like sernovich uh i expect that we're going to start getting targeted as well
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:46.160]  i agree with that i think i know the attack on me is the cover for everybody else getting banned
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:53.680]  there's no question in fact i already went ahead and and deleted my facebook pages and my facebook
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:59.440]  account just because i figured you know if they're going to if they're going to ban significant figures
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:04.240]  like alex jones and there's absolutely no point in my making any attempt to build up a platform
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:09.920]  on facebook and that's the problem there's signaling that we're not welcome when we're the
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:15.120]  people that actually produce what why do you think their stock at twitter and facebook has plunged 30
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  percent the last month because it's been clear that the trump administration is not going to permit
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:32.560]  them to be propped up anymore that's that's you're right like right again box day what do we do then
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:36.880]  what does trump do because i'm not bragging here i literally get asked by people very close to the
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:41.840]  president like write a report what do we i mean i'm like jesus i mean i'm not that smart you guys

[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:50.480]  do what should trump do about the web censorship purge that's what we're going to cover on the

[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:40.560]  i can't get no relief all right best-selling author voxday patriot is our guest here voxday
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:47.920]  dot blogspot.com i asked the question for the break what does trump need to do because
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:52.960]  i'm not on some power trip i'm talking to high level people and they say like you know a year ago
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:58.080]  what's shadow banning or wait or they're and i'm trying to explain like you know google's really
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:04.720]  run by the cia and the uh nasa and here's the here's here's here's when they got founded 17
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:09.920]  years ago here's the incutel documents and here's a link to the national archives they're like really
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:14.080]  god almighty yet as you know they're merging with china and then apple's moved over there and give
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:18.480]  them all the code keys and there's shiny spies everywhere the diane feinstein's run by him i
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:23.920]  mean uh let me just tell you two weeks ago i'm on the phone with people at the pentagon it's
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:28.720]  sent com and i'm like diane feinstein is a chinese agent this they don't even hide it now you see in
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:34.640]  the news so the real reason they're pissed at me is i do open-source research and i have sources so
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:39.040]  i told people on friday diane feinstein's going down as a chi com it was in the new sunday i'm not
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:45.280]  bragging i'm not that smart so i'm sick of doing all the work only in that vox i'm scared because
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:51.200]  we have them we have their ass if people just they are censoring the internet they are blocking
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:57.520]  conservatives they're trying to block the economy coming back uh jerks like uh bill marz saying i
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:03.520]  wanted depression to teach americans to come to heal well screw you man you're not gonna ask my family
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:09.280]  over we have these people we have them in the censorship we have them in espionage and we have
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:14.080]  to do it not because we want power but because we don't want these people running our lives so i'm
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:18.000]  ranting i'm asking you as somebody banned by twitter is this whole thing coming down what does
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.680]  trump and congress and our listeners and me in your view what do we do before they steal this
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:28.240]  election by rigging everything and by taking the internet over in the next three months what do we
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:33.600]  do this now is critical and i gambled everything and i pushed them into this position and it's
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:39.280]  happened again yet again what i envisioned happened but i am now envisioning if we don't press the
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:44.240]  attack and get this front and center to the president and if he doesn't take action we are
[02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:49.120]  going to lose i i agree the enemy's panic but sometimes there's an energy like one of the famous
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:55.840]  african his name lord whatever in japan said the way of the jedi you know the way of what's their
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:23:04.480]  copying the way of the samurai is is is what's the exact quote the way of the samurai is recklessness
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:08.400]  and a hundred men can't beat such a man he guys looked it up the way of the samurai's recklessness
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:12.240]  and i actually get but it's not that you're being reckless it's that you're going with your gut and
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:17.200]  your spirit that's when you're unstoppable so if we don't go with the recklessness i think we're
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:21.680]  going to at least have a civil war we win but my god i don't want to go there i see choose your
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:26.160]  adventure they win that's probably not going to happen i agree with you we have a giant long
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:31.040]  protracted situation that can turn into a new world war that's that's happening that could
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:39.920]  or us winning is so easy if we take destiny in our hands go ahead well i think that a lot of us
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:50.080]  are hoping that there is something to the whole q and on thing with regards to the prosecution of
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:56.320]  the conspirators and the criminals who have been attempting to subvert the government of the united
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:02.800]  states certainly there is is some reason to be optimistic on that score regardless of whether
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:10.720]  the stuff reported by q is literally true or not but with regards to what we can do personally
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:18.800]  what we have to do is we have to stop supporting the enemy you know i didn't mind it all
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:24.880]  when i got kicked off of twitter even though i had i don't know 33 000 followers or something
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:30.880]  because i had largely stopped using it i didn't want to support them anymore i didn't want to
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:39.280]  bring them my traffic etc um what people need to do is they need to start giving up the addiction
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:47.680]  to the left's controlled social media that means you know every person that leaves facebook
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:54.560]  causes other people to consider leaving facebook because they can no longer interact with you there
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:25:01.760]  and the sooner that we reduce facebook and twitter to nothing more than a bunch of lefties
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.360]  attacking people who are posting cat pictures the more likely it is that we're going to win
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:12.160]  now i believe that we're going to win the midterm elections and that we're going to win
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:19.680]  the 2020 presidential election no matter what they do there is not going to be a blue wave
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:24.640]  blue wave i've said that many times i wasn't surprised that the republicans hung on to these
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:30.240]  seats that they were supposed to lose i think that you're going to see even more insanity
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:39.280]  out of the left after the blue wave fails to appear in november 2018 but the main thing that
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:45.520]  people like you and me and and cernovich and possobiak and other people who have
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:50.800]  of followings whether they're large or small is that we need to build our own platforms
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:57.040]  you know we've built info galactic which is a very good alternative a superior alternative
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:02.880]  to wikipedia we need people to start using that we need people to start editing it wikipedia is
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:10.160]  controlled by only 500 people we don't need that many people in order to become the dominant
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:17.120]  information content provider on the internet the same thing is true of of sites like twitter
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:23.840]  sites like um you know sites like facebook it doesn't take that many people to get the trend
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.200]  moving in the positive direction and so the more that we see people moving to sites like
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:34.480]  info galactic to sites like oneway.com the more the the more you're going to see people
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:42.960]  reducing the power of facebook and twitter and other social media platforms the one problem
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:50.800]  is youtube because youtube is run at such a loss that almost no one but google could afford it
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:58.800]  well you're right i was misquoting it was the way of the samurai is is desperation it's the same
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:05.200]  thing with recklessness all i'm saying is literally we can beat these people no one takes the field
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:10.640]  because the average conservative or christian is so humble and that's great but we cannot just sit here
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:16.960]  and i don't want to run things i don't want to be in charge but i'm not going to have people that
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.760]  are trying to sexualize my kids or put deadly vaccines in me that they admit are killing people
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:28.080]  i'm just not going to do it so now i'm all in and so i just realized that i don't know what it is
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:32.480]  about these evil mental midgets that get power and and convalesce together that then want to
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:36.560]  run our lives i just know this they need to get off our backs and i think this thing that jack
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:42.560]  dorsey is backing off now i agree he was the vanguard of censorship trump sends one tweet
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:47.360]  that what he's doing is illegal he backs off so the message of republicans and people is
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:52.240]  get on it get upset have emergency hearings we can stop this instead of sitting there going
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:58.960]  you're a private company you can do whatever you want no your utilities that held things out that
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:03.120]  let people advertise and build you up and now you're letting democrats do whatever they want
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:06.880]  and not let other people do it before just like blacks not letting them vote in the deep south
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:15.920]  here in the 1950s and 60s this is outrageous well it is outrageous and my response to this sort of
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:23.360]  thing is bake the cake you know the the rules have changed the whole idea that a corporation
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:32.560]  can do whatever it wants has been strictly limited legally it's no longer true and so republicans need
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:39.680]  to stop crying about the fact that things have changed and start playing by the new rules in
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:44.240]  order to start winning by them that's right and these are monopolies so you don't get on your
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:48.880]  telephone and somebody censors it okay they don't do that we'll be right back with voxday

[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:34.160]  you know i'm a big historian back when i had time because i stopped reading pulp fiction i was
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:38.800]  about 10 or 11 and got into like science fiction i was about 14 in history after that because it
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:42.880]  was so much more interesting and there was so much history each page had battles wars you name
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:49.440]  it i remember reading a few books about imperial japan and feudal japan before that i remember reading
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:56.400]  a quote that i remember just a few years ago and found online of lord naoshi gay said the way of the
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:34:03.520]  samurai is desperateness 10 men or more cannot kill such a man common sense will not accomplish great
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:10.080]  things simply becoming insane and desperate in the way of the samurai if one uses discrimination
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.440]  he will fall behind like trump said the deepest thing ever did was start being shallow one needs
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:20.240]  neither loyalty nor devotion but simply to become desperate in the way loyalty and devotion are
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:30.560]  themselves within desperation and i'm all intellectual until the fight starts and i've
[02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:35.360]  learned to just go with the desperation of not wanting to be ruled by these evil people and that
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:40.880]  always leads me to victory when i overthink things and do everything i'm now a follower a leader
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:45.840]  has to be ready to put themselves in the position and i've done some things the last few weeks that
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:51.840]  i did on purpose only told my father about it and uh he's got the record of it but the point is
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:56.880]  is that i knew at a gut level it was right now i'm betting my native intellect against the globalist
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:02.560]  i'm betting my subconscious and my ancestors against theirs but my sternovich is here we're
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:08.960]  also uh have vox day as a surprise for a good time in a moment but i don't think we've won but i think
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:14.480]  we're in the fight and have the initiative and i believe this attack is the ground zero to set
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:19.120]  the precedent for everyone else for a few days folks were caught flat-footed but i'm confident
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:25.440]  now my sternovich we talked about this privately last week i'm confident now that this if seized
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:31.680]  by trump and others if they move this is the big election issue and the election of freedom and i
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:35.920]  i think the censorship that's already been going on we had to force it out in the open
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:40.240]  i think we're looking at victory uh but sometimes you're pessimistic you're a smart guy what do you
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:49.360]  think uh mike sternovich well the attacks are only going to intensify and the good news is that the
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:54.640]  enemy is emboldened in a way that you want them emboldened they're becoming reckless now they're
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:01.200]  becoming um they're not they're not thinking through the next move it's now just strict bloodlust
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:07.440]  and there's two ways that you can always trigger a blunder by an enemy one is you make them angry
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:13.440]  and rage and two is you make them feel like they're winning and that you're about to be defeated
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:17.600]  because then they'll take reckless moves it's a strategic retreat so a lot of people noticed
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:24.240]  with me is that i pretended that i was depressed and hiding out and stuff and then i came out with
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:28.720]  the james gun thing and people a friend of mine who actually understands these things a very high
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:35.360]  level person the pentagon said you just did what the but the dingus con the moguls would do is you
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:40.480]  would retreat and then everybody thought oh we got you guys now we're going to destroy you guys now
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:46.240]  and then suddenly you find out that that this was all a bruise and of course i was never despondent
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:53.040]  or demoralized at all and i got that and i get what you're doing here's what i'm saying you just
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:37:00.960]  mirrored what i was saying with a twist desperation is not arrogant lust for power and hate in a rage
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:05.040]  desperation is looking at your kids you got to get out of the situation your brain makes the right
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:09.600]  decision instinctively i mean you agree or disagree that that a lot of times i i want to hear
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:14.000]  your real tale was i you call that art types i i more and more go off my gut after i've done the
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.800]  research and i just make a prime approximation and go with it because if i over analyze it may
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:23.680]  fail when i go with gut it seems to never fail do you get what i'm saying how i made the choice
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:32.080]  to to bring them out oh well i know for well so three things one is that in fact is a whole
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:37.520]  chapter in guerrilla mindset about your gut and how your gut is referred by scientists as a second
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:44.160]  brain 75 percent of your serotonin and dopamine those neurotransmitters are actually in your
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:48.480]  intestines people think that's crazy and then i say well no no it's been proven we have a
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:54.880]  second brain in our spinal cord and our guts yeah so so it is there but the samurai of course our
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:38:01.440]  brain's gonna want to know what we're eating i mean yeah of course yeah so literally your your
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:08.320]  your gut is your instinct now what the samurais we're talking about is the alignment of purpose
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:14.720]  and the alignment of of your your higher levels here and then the instinctual stuff that keeps you
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:20.000]  alive total commitment you're talking about total commitment correct total commitment singularity
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:26.080]  i call it the singularity of focus where you know that and this of course was in the haggard
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:30.640]  quarry was written about also where they said that a samurai is so committed to his purpose
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:36.320]  that he may be struck down but he will take the enemy with them because he's so committed to that
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:42.320]  strike that he will take the enemy with him so that is the singularity purpose did desperation
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:50.480]  spoken about in the samurai literature is a little different than mad rage yeah lustful controlling
[02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:56.400]  rage i agree yeah it doesn't mean that you're despondent it's a very very specific word
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:00.960]  loss and translation it doesn't no i agree desperate means your total i agree your body's
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:08.000]  aligned in total commitment right so so for me and in you too because i remember um a year ago you
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:11.760]  told me that you were going to do this because i told you i wish that you wouldn't do it we had a
[02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:16.320]  long conversation um in person in austin go ahead and tell the story then since you brought it up
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:22.080]  then we'll get vox days a little present for you go ahead okay so i was in um i came out in austin
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:27.440]  for the megan kelly thing and i said alex they're they're going to kill you here's what you have to
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:32.080]  do you have to quit trolling and i told them because that's the thing people always say oh
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:37.840]  you know you talk shit on alice the crap on alice jones no i do not we may i demand i just said i
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:44.000]  think you gotta quit trolling um absolutely hundred percent and and you said um actually no i'm not
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.720]  going to do that i'm gonna troll the media into even more traps and i'm gonna bring them out even
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:56.480]  more and i said okay you know reasonable people can disagree on the right um approach here and you
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:04.880]  did and what you've done though is it's interesting because what you've done is made the media lie
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:10.160]  and here's what i mean when i when i read the article say go oh alex jones threatened moeller
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:17.360]  i go oh crap what happened 15 articles i read alex i promise you i went to google news 15 articles
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:22.960]  said that you you threatened them none of them show the video none of them show the video then i
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:29.440]  watched the video and i go wait it was just like a spaghetti western sketch so anybody who's actually
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:34.960]  committed now realizes wow that the media they just lie about everything and i knew they lie so i
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:40.240]  didn't lie to gonna do it i was honest but i figured i told my dad this i said this will trigger them
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.200]  with the total ban which will then alert trump everybody else to make an issue at a gut level
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:51.840]  i knew being desperate being aligned in purpose that it had to happen and now it's worked so
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:57.840]  well and it had to be done in the open i mean the the good thing about this is that
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.040]  they're murdering you in the open which is better than the shadow bands now now a couple of things
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:09.040]  happened that were advantage and advantageous the one is that i had begun retweeting a lot

[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:25.760]  inside baseball but we do i never trolled lies i i will say something that's very clear i am
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:33.440]  politically spaghetti western music at high noon uh metaphysically this is a showdown of powers i'm
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:39.120]  not backing down muller's not backing down we're gonna have a shootout like red river shootout
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:44.160]  and football knowing they would go with that so i could illustrate they're the ones saying really
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:50.720]  kill trump attack his family you know cnn got after scolese got caught or he got shot they're
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.120]  sitting there going got caught in gunfire they try to kill 17 members of the freedom caucus
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:02.480]  and cnn's like well the guy really was you know mad at trump that's so sick i don't want violence
[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:06.960]  everybody knows that but they would play that double standard so that's the type of stuff i do
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:12.000]  now mike sternovich is here vox days and leave us a moment do a little bit more with mike sternovich
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:20.160]  but as we pull back here and we see the lay of the land i'm mad at trump about continuing the war
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:26.080]  in afghanistan he means well he's a great guy he's not a globalist i love him to death i'm mad
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:29.760]  about him continuing to not expose vaccines like he said he would do but i'm sure we'll get to it later
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:35.520]  but just sitting there i mean it took us a long time to get him informed about shadow banning
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:40.640]  i know i got him a report in his hands a week before he talked about it
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:45.840]  and then they got even worse right on time for me and i'm not name dropping we were pushing hard
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:49.760]  like the campaign's like well what do you want to tell the president he wants to know what's going
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.720]  on you know what's what you want i'm like what i want is him to go after internet censorship
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:59.280]  we're gonna lose this midterm this is a campaign violation they're giving billions of democrats
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:03.920]  letting them promote and banning all republicans and shadow banning what shadow banning i'm like the
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.640]  head of the campaign you're this big guru that knows all this stuff i'm gonna stop right there
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:16.560]  how in earth so mike vox day jumping anytime here i i love trump and i know he's a good guy
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:21.120]  but he loves fox news and the damn new york times too much he i know for a fact he reads
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:26.000]  new york times all day and sits there and watches fox news used to they bring him clips of my show
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:31.440]  clips of cernovich his son would bring those to you you know to him this is the issue they're
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:37.200]  blocking everybody they're intimidating they're doing it i'm mad at trump only to say this because
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:42.080]  it'll get to him what does trump need to do vox day mike cernovich or do you disagree
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:44.240]  that this is the big enchilada right now
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:51.200]  about forcing internet censorship out in the open and what's happening we've done it
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:57.200]  i've pawned sacrifice myself the listeners get it well the the issue with trump is that
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:03.760]  trumps great it's like a greek flawed trumps greatest strength and is also his greatest
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:08.240]  weakness and that he thinks he knows everything and he's totally self-confident so he's a man in
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:13.360]  his own world right he really believes he could have won the election without alternative media
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:18.800]  hundred percent believes it so from his mind he thinks well it's bad this is too bad i don't
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:23.280]  like that it's happening oh but he wants to add confident just like he wanted men his
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:30.880]  supporters are being attacked everywhere exactly so in his mind if all alternative media is banned
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:35.920]  it's not a big deal he'll he'll be fine he'll be okay doesn't he get alternative media and all
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:43.680]  these social networks had 95 more bandwidth and people than the freaking fox news no no no he
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:50.240]  doesn't he believes what let me tell him then poll watch and had videos every day with average of
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:54.480]  six million views at least ten of them had 35 million views or more they deleted them the
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:51:00.160]  day hillary lost they ignored us and didn't think we had power poll was way more reached than me
[02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:06.320]  okay i'll say it anybody paul didn't even know it we had billions of views for you that all
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:11.760]  disappeared on our facebook trump you didn't have billions of views on that stupid ass fox news
[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:17.600]  and nothing against fox news but i want to win this hell man but i'm sorry but exactly trump
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:23.520]  didn't know how much he had sorry go ahead guys i'll shut up but if we're going to win then we
[02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:30.240]  need to stop screwing around and playing on facebook's no i agree but what i'm saying is trump can
[02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:35.040]  make them open it up for everybody i'm sorry go ahead but that's but but that's a mistake we don't
[02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:40.480]  want them to open it up yep we want that we we want to build our own but we haven't built the
[02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:45.280]  platforms yet vox we have the reason i'm like this is we're two minutes to midnight i'm vox
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:48.880]  make your point for two minutes i'm sorry than mike it's just i'm telling you we have to attack
[02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:54.720]  them on censorship and election meddling now that is the answer go ahead right well but then we
[02:51:54.720 --> 02:51:59.920]  should be going after them on on racketeering on collusion people need to be filing private
[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:06.160]  suits but the reality is all of this stuff is secondary the main thing is to turn them into
[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:13.040]  myspace the main thing is to get no i agree if we leave them that's great and they die i agree but
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:19.600]  now in the next three months i don't think it happens now we people are pissed they've been censored
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:24.240]  i think prompt makes it a big issue they back off for the election we win if not they're thinking
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:28.160]  he isn't noticing they're saying will he notice we're stealing the election ahead of him losing
[02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:36.080]  them will impeach him go ahead well again i think that they can go make these efforts but i think
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:41.120]  that the trend towards nationalism around the world and in the states the fact that the economy
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:46.640]  is doing well the fact that the tariffs are having the no i agree that we win long term but we may
[02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:50.560]  have a civil war if we don't beat it now i'm gonna come back to you vox you gotta go in a minute
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:56.720]  sort of itch i've been ranting you try to talk just i i feel in a spiritual level desperation
[02:52:56.720 --> 02:53:02.000]  we're going to win if we take victory in our hands if we don't make trump and others which
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:06.800]  donald juniors ready to do it everybody gets it everybody's ready if trump doesn't lead this train
[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:11.440]  and point it out the only reason we're still on twitter is because trump told jack dorsi watch your
[02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:18.960]  ass well i mean i'm actually quite pessimistic about the the immediate near-term solution
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:24.800]  the strikes on you you are the big white whale and that's not racial of course for the illiterate
[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:30.560]  liberals for media matters who watch these for clips that's not anti-white people that was out
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:34.880]  hunting for me exactly but the soros people they're not literate so they don't even know
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:39.360]  know they don't they don't understand that reference so you're the white whale now they're
[02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:44.000]  going to go after everybody but they're going to go after you even more and you and i i'm not
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:48.240]  going to say why but you and i know how they're going to do it and you know i don't want to give
[02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:54.160]  them any more ideas there they are now banning dinesh desu says that the nation from theaters
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:54:00.400]  that was just on dinesh's twitter feed you um sir are costing a college applicants for people
[02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:05.440]  which is good because in the long term i'm i'm optimistic but i'm laying out the short term case
[02:54:05.440 --> 02:54:11.840]  i sent a link to daria where a college administrator was not going to let somebody come to college
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:16.960]  because they followed you on twitter didn't like you didn't retweet you followed so there's totally
[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:21.840]  mafia harassment that's what i mean not even about us it's the it's the serious racketeering
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:27.200]  going on by democrats i think trump makes that an issue well yeah but in the short term there's
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:33.920]  going to be more bodies literal and figurative um for right wing people independent thinkers
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:38.160]  because as you know 20 percent of your audience is actually liberal 20 percent of my audience is
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:43.120]  liberal they're just fed up with the lies they're going to go after anybody wants to talk about
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:48.240]  vaccine awareness and report on vaccination do five more minutes with us i'm going to finish

[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:29.920]  so mike started with one more segment then roger stone kind of because with him it takes some calls
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:34.480]  mike i've been ranting and raving for the last 30 minutes you're on other points you like to add
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:39.120]  about where we are in this world i think we've drawn them out for their big censorship move
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:44.240]  they're concerted racketeering operation i think this has a smell of victory if people get upset
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:50.720]  if they get involved the strizand effect is in full play okay so here's the issue and this is the
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:59.200]  issue that trump has um you and i are going to be okay because they go after us harder and we do
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:04.560]  better the people i worry about is i worry about the people who this is what keeps me up at night
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:09.520]  i don't care about in my own mind the millions of average facebook and twitter and google and
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:15.120]  youtube users who are all being blacklisted and they're getting doxed and you and i think college
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:20.320]  is a scam but if you want to go to college that's your choice i worry about you know the the ground
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:26.160]  level people who are being doxed the antifa tried to murder a 55 year old jewish man outside of an
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:32.000]  event because they are the antifa are the nazis and the brown shirts so i'm i'm not worried about you
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:36.800]  i don't go to bed worried about you you're fine i don't go to bed worrying about me i'm fine i go
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:41.680]  to bed and i think what about that person who just has a regular job and they're working hard just
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:47.120]  good america a good americana a guy that has muscular dysentery and is Hispanic and shows up
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:51.600]  for free speech against beat up by a bunch of white dudes but it's okay they beat him up because
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:57.920]  they're liberal or or they find out that oh he liked a facebook page or shared an article and
[03:01:57.920 --> 03:02:03.360]  then they doxed him try to get him murdered try to get him fired so for me for you and me i'm i'm
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:09.040]  optimistic i mean and in the day if they somehow tried to kill my online stuff i would just go
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:14.240]  meditate and go to the gym and lift and you know whatever dude like my life was great before i got
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:21.120]  into this war my life was amazing i was in great shape i i just did mindset work two or three
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:26.000]  hours a day i have clients who pay me a ton of money to to help them you know really take life
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:32.160]  so for me my life was so much better but i realized that they're going to murder everyone if we're
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:39.680]  not able to stop this now and politically metaphorically sorosensors o sernovich and it's your
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:45.120]  side by the way the left you're the people out there five hundred twenty articles violence against
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:50.320]  trump supporters john nolte of bright bars catalogued them vicious attacks kanda someone's
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:57.360]  run out of a bar uh portland oregon uh women being attacked a black woman had her hat stolen
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:03.200]  we have people in berth they particularly call black police officers the n word i mean what the
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:12.000]  hell where's the video we have this video that i posted i found portland abolish ice they call
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:17.840]  black officers hey you n word hey and they don't say the n word they say stay at all but why why
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:27.120]  would you what what that's what they do they are so here's the thing to understand the way to
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:34.320]  understand social justice is that they are the intellectual descendants of pulpit they are the
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:38.560]  intellectual descendants of fallen they're they believe that the total rulers what do you make
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:43.520]  of the police finally standing up to them in portland and berkeley i think that sent a shock
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:47.920]  wave through their funders the the the jigs up i think they panicked because they got this whole
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:52.720]  civil war thing planned i think cops even in blue city saying no i think that's what's got them in
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:59.040]  crisis mode well not only that but i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna do next to antifa and i can
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:04.640]  announce it because there's no way to stop this there is a man facing felony criminal trial in
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:10.640]  september named david cambell he tried to murder a 55 year old trump supporter so his name is david
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:20.080]  cambell and once he's convicted i will be ensuring that he is sued for his violent deeds and once he
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:26.320]  is sued as you know there's something called discovery every email he sent every email you're
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:32.800]  going to get all his documents from his providers the whole enchilada and i can say that publicly
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:38.960]  because there ain't nothing anybody can do because i'm not going to sue antifa it will only be against
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:44.480]  it's called it'll be in state campel john dove we're on the march the empire is on the run mike

[03:06:27.120 --> 03:06:32.400]  dot com or news wars dot com or prison planet dot com because a discuss that we've been with for like
[03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:36.560]  six seven years and they did advertising with us we did it with them they just said hey we're not in
[03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:41.760]  business with you and we can't send you emails mail chimp they used to follow all the rules they
[03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:47.920]  they blocked us and it's like 15 computer groups not just itunes not just apple that runs slave
[03:06:47.920 --> 03:06:54.640]  factories in china not just google not just youtube and it's it's everything but but the good news is
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:07:03.360]  even though we can't email you millions several million people have gone to info wars dot com
[03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:09.200]  for slash newsletter and they've sent us their email and opted in so as soon as we get the new
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:13.600]  legal lawful email has all these rules this big tech doesn't want you using it that's why they
[03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:18.480]  pass all these laws where they can spy on you but you know email is barely usable this is we're
[03:07:18.480 --> 03:07:24.160]  going back retro now so info wars dot com for slash newsletter info wars dot com for slash app
[03:07:24.160 --> 03:07:30.880]  our apps now number one on itunes number one on droid it was just number three earlier today
[03:07:30.880 --> 03:07:39.920]  number one on new apps it's now number one and cnn i mean this is they're such authoritarian losers
[03:07:39.920 --> 03:07:48.560]  they're such dirtbags they're so soviet nazi whatever like they're like oh take them down
[03:07:48.560 --> 03:07:54.800]  they're number one wow so you want us it's like a phone book listing for the computer
[03:07:54.800 --> 03:08:00.560]  and you pay for the app you build it you put it on their platform and then now they're looking
[03:08:00.560 --> 03:08:05.680]  at it i want to ask roger stone banned off twitter what like a year ago milo two years ago
[03:08:05.680 --> 03:08:11.200]  why do you think jack dorsi it's like you know facebook said two weeks ago oh jones is following
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:15.840]  the rules and they deliberate and say no he hasn't banned us do you think dorsi is doing that or do
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:21.360]  you think trumps tweet a week and a half ago that shadow banning totally illegal we're looking at it
[03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:25.760]  looking at it of republican congressmen and others do you think that's got his attention
[03:08:25.760 --> 03:08:31.280]  because dorsi was one of the biggest censors out there why is he suddenly playing this game with
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:37.840]  oh alex jones what do you think you know honesty alex i think it's because he banned milo then he
[03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:45.520]  banned myself uh if he then banned you i think he didn't like the narrative we were banned for
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:54.400]  political reasons uh twitter's uh standards their guidelines are so incredibly vague until the newest
[03:08:54.400 --> 03:09:02.240]  iteration that are still broad enough for them to sift out conservative or pro trump or republican
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:09.600]  or libertarian thought uh that it's ridiculous so it's kind of a head fake plus in all honesty alex
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:19.280]  will all do respect banned on facebook banned on spotify banned on youtube's banned on on instagram
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:28.480]  banned across the board on itunes yet the market always surprises you doesn't it a record number
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:35.360]  of people signing up for our podcasts alex jones show the war room are the real news with david
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:43.840]  night a record number of people watching it online streaming on our own site a record number of people
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:50.640]  listening to it on terrestrial radio your ratings up in every market no they are i mean to number one
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:56.640]  you are heard so so so what are they thinking with the strizand effect because let me tell you
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:02.080]  millions of sign-offs for email millions of people following our podcast at info wars dot com
[03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:05.600]  forward slash show just click it and get it and if everybody else doing that says hey here's the
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:09.920]  forbidden thing get it what did they think they were doing why do you think they did this roger
[03:10:10.960 --> 03:10:18.240]  well because uh as you yourself uh said uh we are the tip of the spear little did you know when
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:24.960]  you coined the phrase the u.s senator murphy would say we're the tip of the riding iceberg well i mean
[03:10:24.960 --> 03:10:30.240]  when you coined the phrase we are the resistance little did you know how true that was and now they
[03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:36.400]  want us to not out the resistance because we fear to go where others dare not go where eagles
[03:10:36.400 --> 03:10:42.000]  dare the truth our audience does look at this quote by senator christ murphy info wars is the tip of a
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:46.560]  giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like facebook and youtube to tear down the nation
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:53.360]  and tear it apart that's what he's doing these companies must do more than take down one website
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:59.200]  the survival of our democracy depends on it so destroy free speech to save our democracy that
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:05.360]  is crazy well first of all we completely reject their characterization of what we talk about
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:11.360]  here and what we advocate and what we tolerate that is a false depiction of who we are i agree
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:17.120]  by the way i can decide whether i love or hate that jacket god well i've got to i've i've got to
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:22.720]  i'll address this i was just i was gonna do it in the well we'll do it later because i it's it's
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:28.640]  really obnoxious but that's fine let look there's a story there's a story behind it which must be
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:36.640]  told it was made by chip in new york sometime in the fifties uh and i saw it the fashion of institute
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:43.840]  column uh uh fashion institute in new york had a display of ivy league fashion i saw it several
[03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:50.880]  years later i saw it in a thrift shop on the lower east side where i bought it for 75 bucks
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:57.600]  it's a classic that you can't wear every day so i understand but let me bring what do you call that
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:12:04.160]  then uh it's just uh it's just an ivy league style chip was like brooks brothers and uh and
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:10.960]  their ilk kind of a stop right there well let's stop right there let's get a little serious issues
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:15.920]  i shouldn't have brought this up i will change for the next segment by the way now you're great
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:19.680]  it's just let me just you know a nice blue sports tag without having to look great right
[03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:25.040]  and with that black tie but let me get serious here we know feinstein's a chicom agent most of
[03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:29.120]  democrats are that's what i call us russian agents because they're the chicom agents never
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:32.960]  got to this new york times thing where she was here saying i'm a russian agent tell me how you got
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:39.040]  paid by them how you work for them and i'm it was like tell me how you know you were a flying
[03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:44.560]  carpet salesman in istanbul five thousand years ago was that ridiculous but feinstein now coming
[03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:51.760]  out feinstein ties to china go way deeper than alleged office spy so i've said this is the issue
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:57.360]  you bring this out the russian collusion is the diversion google apple moving to china censoring
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:03.120]  this is what trump has to do this in web censorship we've forced it out in the open made it the top
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:08.080]  story the last few days bigger than even republicans winning these special elections there's no way
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:14.080]  trump can ignore this now roger i mean my gut told me we could win we could force it out this is
[03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:19.440]  victory on a silver platter how do we get trump to talk about the democrats and the illegal campaign
[03:13:19.440 --> 03:13:25.040]  contributions blocking libertarians conservatives trump nationalist giving democrats full power
[03:13:25.040 --> 03:13:29.680]  it's all admitted it's all happening i sacrificed a lot of our operation to do this but i knew it
[03:13:29.680 --> 03:13:35.760]  was critical so i did it now i've laid out the buffet here what do you think well first of all
[03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:42.960]  i think you're the first significant voice in america who has linked the the tech left and those
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:48.240]  engaged in the strangulation of our first amendment rights to the chinese communists
[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:53.920]  particularly through apple and other and it's total it's total it's total it's total they've
[03:13:53.920 --> 03:13:59.360]  sold us out they have completely sold us out for a mess of potting they've taken hundreds of millions
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:05.440]  of dollars to sell our security and our free expression to uh and they can't believe that
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:12.880]  we're onto it they can't believe we're onto it you know and the president has to grasp this as a
[03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:19.840]  potential campaign issue the infiltration of the democratic party uh the infiltration of of the
[03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:26.960]  technical capability in the country by the chinese is undeniable that is the real issue here that is
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:34.000]  who has their foot on our throats today because we speak out against their tyranny and how pissed
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:38.720]  are they that we've blown it wide open the pentagon agrees everybody knows it's true they own the debt
[03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:44.000]  they own hollywood they own a bunch of democrats and now the shot across the bow with feinstein being
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:50.880]  exposed billions that are husband made and and biotech in deals with china i mean this is on it
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:59.040]  is here absolutely uh and i think the president gets it but we shall see a newly combative
[03:14:59.040 --> 03:15:05.200]  donald trump has been seen on twitter of late and he's putting together i think a lot of dots that
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:12.400]  need connecting these days well the ace of spades to trump the enemy is chai kham interference
[03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:17.520]  it's the proof the russians couldn't wipe their ass with both hands nothing against him and this
[03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:23.280]  is the key we play this card the first of them a card we win trump doesn't do it we lose he will
[03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:31.760]  play the card he will execute order number 66 uh here's the one thing you can predict about donald
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:39.120]  trump he's entirely unpredictable alex well we shall see i just saw the power i agree i thought
[03:15:39.120 --> 03:15:45.600]  power to shape this narrative and to win in 2018 and 20 on it in my opinion well i just saw steven
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:51.040]  corbera last night said it's a conspiracy theory that china's involved they're real scared of that
[03:15:53.200 --> 03:15:57.840]  healthcare reform is confusing but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan keeping your

[03:20:41.680 --> 03:20:46.480]  right now when they're censoring us and cutting us off every platform with our tens of millions
[03:20:46.480 --> 03:20:51.760]  of followers from itunes to youtube to facebook tens of millions of subscribed people that they
[03:20:51.760 --> 03:20:56.640]  would already not let us get to but not even cut that off and they're arrogance
[03:20:56.640 --> 03:21:06.800]  what does trump need to do because we're here this is happening this is ongoing this is the big
[03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:11.520]  issue this is the election fraud this is a discrimination now now that's one point i'm
[03:21:11.520 --> 03:21:17.680]  going to ask you but secondarily let me ask you this one first let me ask question b b side first
[03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:24.080]  we were number three on itunes android android today the brand new app three weeks ago that we
[03:21:24.080 --> 03:21:29.600]  just launched they have to do this they're now both number one on news now trending
[03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:38.320]  in the top 20 and one to be the number one app in the world and then cnn these are apps for
[03:21:38.320 --> 03:21:45.600]  there for years aren't even this close cnn is ultimately involved here everywhere literally
[03:21:45.600 --> 03:21:51.200]  lobbying for just us listed in the phone book just an app we paid for and put on to access us
[03:21:51.200 --> 03:21:57.200]  there i mean that's like a hollywood movie like they don't want us on the baseball field we get
[03:21:57.200 --> 03:22:04.320]  up we knock two grand slams and five home runs in a row i mean if they do this can you imagine a
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:10.160]  jury with they went to number one and then they banned them i mean america and the world loves
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:16.160]  number one they love they love antifa 10 to one attack in rufio and him knocking them out in defense
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:22.800]  like a lion that it's so villainous like is how what do they think they're doing do they not
[03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:28.320]  get what's happening what do you make of the info wars app the new one the info wars official all
[03:22:28.320 --> 03:22:34.480]  the other apps are skyrocketing to our apps other apps screwed up apps but our info wars official
[03:22:34.480 --> 03:22:43.040]  is literally having 10 000 people download it every couple minutes it's millions are downloading
[03:22:43.040 --> 03:22:47.360]  and millions are signing up for the newsletter millions are going to info wars dot com forward
[03:22:47.360 --> 03:22:53.200]  slash show it's over five plus million the last few days uh just to get our podcast direct from us
[03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:59.040]  they have really jumped the shark yeah they've got our email shut off now they've they've got our
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:03.200]  comment shut off so you evil people can't communicate with each other but that's only pissing
[03:23:03.200 --> 03:23:07.360]  people off more hopefully that'll be up soon so yeah we're in the fight we're not saying we're
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:13.280]  unscathed but god it's great to like have them do this and then i thought you know people would
[03:23:13.280 --> 03:23:17.760]  respond to be upset and that would point out to congress what was happening so we could fight back
[03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:22.960]  so we kind of sacrificially did this but this is going better than i thought a what do you
[03:23:22.960 --> 03:23:26.960]  think's happening what do you think is cnn opening lobbying for their competition to be shut down
[03:23:26.960 --> 03:23:31.680]  and be let's not start sucking each other's you know what's like the wolf says in pulp fiction
[03:23:31.680 --> 03:23:35.920]  before we've actually got home the woods are lovely dark and deep miles ago before we sleep
[03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:43.760]  how could they jerk our defeat out of the jaws of our victory well alex it's the free market
[03:23:43.760 --> 03:23:50.240]  that's the marvel of it despite this near strangulation of info wars and the alex jones show
[03:23:50.240 --> 03:23:56.560]  along with the war room and real news with david night oh david night had 10 million subscribers
[03:23:56.560 --> 03:24:00.720]  its own level yeah 10 million subscribers i'm sorry to rub you're right they just blew him away
[03:24:00.720 --> 03:24:06.320]  never a very gentle sorry go ahead go ahead and they're finding us and thank god they're still
[03:24:06.320 --> 03:24:13.280]  buying our products because uh the legal costs in this are enormous it it is and has always
[03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:20.800]  been a complex legal question uh as to by the way my legal cost last month was three find this
[03:24:20.800 --> 03:24:26.640]  an egregious violation of our first amendment rights that argument has not prevailed in court
[03:24:26.640 --> 03:24:31.680]  no but i agree but roger i'm gonna leave down companies i'm gonna likely to prevail is a uh
[03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:38.720]  an anti monopolistic antitrust an argument or a argument that is based in contract law because
[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:45.600]  when we signed up and when we paid them for advertising let's say at facebook or or twitter
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:51.840]  they entered into a contract with us that they have now violated uh this has to be attacked at all
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:58.800]  levels roger in the courts uh on the streets in peaceful protest but that which does not kill us
[03:24:58.800 --> 03:25:04.240]  makes us stronger and that's the effect that you refer to now no i agree and with skype sometimes
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:07.360]  you can't hear me i've been jumping in obnoxiously i'm gonna leave here now i'm just asking this
[03:25:07.360 --> 03:25:16.080]  question what do you make of cnn when we go to number one they've written like five articles it
[03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:22.560]  was three now it's five five articles show saying band band band i mean doesn't america get that we're
[03:25:22.560 --> 03:25:28.080]  number one now they've been on there for years we beat them and now they want us banned you just
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:33.680]  type in uh cnn take alex jones off itunes that's an article from yesterday it's the one from today
[03:25:33.680 --> 03:25:38.800]  there's like five articles today i mean that is so brazen i think that backfires on them roger
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:46.880]  well alex i think i told you that i was recently in new york on business and uh when i left uh
[03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:55.120]  the apartment where i was to leave for the airport you were on fox uh when i was in the cab i heard
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:26:01.600]  at least three different reports about your being banned when i got to the airport of course it was
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:09.040]  new york and cnn was on they were gleefully reporting that you had been banned uh when i got on the
[03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:15.760]  plane and watched uh the news uh from my seat jet blue is excellent in that regard most of the news
[03:26:15.760 --> 03:26:22.800]  was about alex jones they have merely catapulted your brand uh and more people will find us even
[03:26:22.800 --> 03:26:27.600]  if they cannot find us that's my question you still go to the infowars site and sign up for our
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:34.640]  podcasts now but that's my question roger what were they what were they thinking this is blown
[03:26:34.640 --> 03:26:39.920]  up spectacularly in their face they'll probably just ban the apps but i'm like in a okay your
[03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:47.200]  number one they ban your app i mean this is ridiculous uh it is uh it is brainless it's
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:55.440]  mindless uh but let's recognize apple owns the the app store and they could banish us at any time
[03:26:55.440 --> 03:27:01.840]  which is why despite our soaring spot uh you know uh people signing up it's essential that you go
[03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:09.120]  sign up for the podcast directly at the info wars dot com site that way the chain of command will be

[03:33:18.320 --> 03:33:31.920]  now your host roger stone welcome back you're on the alex jones show and yes i have done
[03:33:31.920 --> 03:33:42.240]  a more subdued sports jacket my chapeau today my hat is a homage to matt drudge who i admire for
[03:33:42.240 --> 03:33:51.040]  his standing tall in his coverage of the assault on alex jones and info wars when it comes to their
[03:33:51.040 --> 03:33:59.200]  first amendment rights in what has been one of the most chilling things i have ever seen a tech
[03:33:59.200 --> 03:34:09.840]  left litz creek of censorship has been visited on alex jones and the info wars site getting knocked
[03:34:09.840 --> 03:34:22.720]  simultaneously off of facebook periscope spotify youtube's uh and others uh it is stunning uh the
[03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:32.560]  obviousness of this takedown it's very important to note that is based solely on a mischaracterization
[03:34:32.560 --> 03:34:40.800]  a distortion of the various things that alex jones and the folks at info wars have actually
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:50.080]  said you don't have to agree with alex jones or anyone here uh at info wars uh to agree
[03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:57.760]  that we have an absolute first amendment right to say it unfortunately uh that argument will
[03:34:57.760 --> 03:35:06.080]  probably not prevail prevail in the courts uh because on the one hand while facebook and twitter
[03:35:06.080 --> 03:35:16.000]  and others uh on that platform such as instagram claim to be the town square the public square
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:23.040]  they in fact are privately owned companies perhaps it is time for them to be regulated like
[03:35:23.040 --> 03:35:29.280]  utilities this would have to be done by the congress but there are other issues on which
[03:35:29.280 --> 03:35:38.400]  they are vulnerable when i was banned at twitter uh shortly after my friend mylo was banned i vowed
[03:35:38.400 --> 03:35:47.200]  to bring a legal action and i will but i let others who had been banned rush into that breach
[03:35:47.200 --> 03:35:55.040]  to see which of their legal arguments with which stand early judicial examination and
[03:35:55.920 --> 03:36:06.640]  could uh so could uh get beyond summary judgment the most uh favorable uh issues here
[03:36:06.640 --> 03:36:16.800]  uh pertain to these behemoths in the tech left signing of contracts with people who sign up
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:25.440]  they are also using antitrust and monopolistic practices to crowd out the competition while
[03:36:25.440 --> 03:36:34.480]  at the same time engaging actively in shadow banning and a dozen other techniques uh in which
[03:36:34.480 --> 03:36:41.920]  they manipulate the algorithms the reach uh and the presence of conservative voices
[03:36:42.560 --> 03:36:48.320]  we're going to take your calls i want to stay focused on this issue but i also want to reflect
[03:36:48.320 --> 03:36:55.120]  on something alice jones has said from the beginning because i must tell you i talked to him often
[03:36:55.120 --> 03:37:04.640]  late at night uh and he's stoic in the face of this onslaught he's resolved to make info wars
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:13.760]  bigger and more successful uh and to reach beyond those uh who listen to us now he is gratified
[03:37:14.400 --> 03:37:23.680]  so many people in the community have rallied to our podcast rallied to our app application rallied
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:34.720]  to the info wars dot com store uh where we are having record traffic on every front uh on terrestrial
[03:37:34.720 --> 03:37:42.640]  radio the ratings are up for the alex jones show uh where it appears on television where many
[03:37:42.640 --> 03:37:50.480]  stations have recently signed up uh our ratings are up the american people know the real deal
[03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:56.320]  when they see it you don't have to agree with everything alex jones says to realize that he's
[03:37:56.320 --> 03:38:03.280]  a patriot and his heart is in the right place and i'm tired of seeing the fake news left
[03:38:03.280 --> 03:38:10.400]  and those on the technoth distort the things he has actually said on news events over the many
[03:38:10.400 --> 03:38:18.400]  decades that he has covered them so if there were ever a time that info wars needs your assistance
[03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:25.200]  that time would be now i urge you to go to the info wars store right now uh because we have some
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:34.160]  terrific specials uh that i think are worthy of pointing out among others uh you can get my new
[03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:43.760]  book stones rules at a terrific price on the info wars store dot com store with a special uh
[03:38:43.760 --> 03:38:51.520]  uh offer that is available to info warriors only if you buy my new book stones rules which is a
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:59.840]  field manual for victory it's the the uh a linsky manual for people who think we like we do
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:07.920]  although it's applicable to anybody as a surefire uh list of axioms and guidelines that have uh
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:16.000]  girded me for a 40 year career in the arena but if you buy it on the info wars dot com store
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:23.040]  and you mail it to me uh at an address that we will give you here in south florida i will
[03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:32.320]  gladly personalize uh the book for you uh and mail it back to you i stress that this is an offer
[03:39:32.320 --> 03:39:39.120]  only available to info warriors uh and i was gratified when i returned from a recent business
[03:39:39.120 --> 03:39:45.200]  trip to have well over a hundred books to sign and get out the door uh we're going to get you that
[03:39:45.200 --> 03:39:52.320]  address before the end of the show uh but uh we we really hope you will patronize the store uh
[03:39:52.320 --> 03:39:58.560]  you'll take a look at our nutraceuticals our t-shirts and so on uh the effort to censor
[03:39:58.560 --> 03:40:07.680]  alice jones uh tied with the outrageous massively expensive harassment lawsuits launched by the
[03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:16.960]  soros connected left uh and uh the uh and the vilification uh in the mainstream media in which
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:23.600]  words are put in his mouth and things and thoughts and theories and memes are attributed to him
[03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:31.040]  that he never said uh is a kafka-esque nightmare uh and now this recent assault
[03:40:31.040 --> 03:40:36.640]  makes it all the more important that you take your favorite links from info wars
[03:40:36.640 --> 03:40:42.560]  and you post them to your own social media and you take the very best of the war room
[03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:49.440]  and you send it to everybody on your email friend list on your instagram friend list
[03:40:49.440 --> 03:40:57.920]  on your facebook friend list you can be an army of one for freedom if you support the president
[03:40:57.920 --> 03:41:05.840]  if you support his agenda if you oppose the globalists if alice jones makes you laugh
[03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:14.320]  and entertains you at the same time he educates you about a different non neocon view of the world
[03:41:14.320 --> 03:41:21.280]  well then we need his voice he has to be part of a vibrant robust alternative media
[03:41:21.280 --> 03:41:29.760]  that's based in a free internet the bad guys are clear google apple who has sold their soul
[03:41:29.760 --> 03:41:40.080]  to the chinese uh many others of these giant silicon valley uh monsters now seek to rig
[03:41:40.080 --> 03:41:47.280]  the very next election we're going to take calls in the next segment but the unequal handling
[03:41:47.280 --> 03:41:53.600]  on facebook and twitter and so on a republican and democratic candidates in view of advertising
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:42:01.200]  raises a whole new battlefield on which uh the left can be defeated under the laws of the united
[03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:09.200]  states it is a stunning strategic error on their part to treat candidates who are republicans
[03:42:09.200 --> 03:42:16.960]  and democrats differently this is a giant mistake by the opposition if you read stone's rules you
[03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:23.920]  know we wait for and pounce upon those mistakes thanks for joining us here on the alex jones

[03:46:53.280 --> 03:47:04.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:15.600 --> 03:47:20.560]  this is bernie sanders and i know a lot of my supporters may not believe this but i listen
[03:47:20.560 --> 03:47:25.360]  to roger stone whenever he's on info wars it's a great program at least in my opinion
[03:47:29.200 --> 03:47:36.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show as i promised we're gonna take your calls in just a moment
[03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:43.200]  one of the things that i have found heartening was the fact that folks like matt drudge and
[03:47:43.200 --> 03:47:51.200]  tucker carlson uh the folks at bright bart now laura ingram this morning uh all standing up
[03:47:51.200 --> 03:47:57.360]  and objecting to the uh strangulation of the first amendment rights of alex jones
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:02.240]  they understand you stand you don't have to agree with everything alex jones says to
[03:48:02.240 --> 03:48:09.440]  recognize that he has a right to say it uh and therefore i salute them uh and others such as
[03:48:09.440 --> 03:48:16.000]  mike savage who have been uh who have had the cojones to speak up but recognize that
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:22.880]  this wave of censorship if it is successful in silencing alex jones and info wars is headed
[03:48:22.880 --> 03:48:29.200]  to a broader series of targets they're already manipulating algorithms and shadow banning
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:35.920]  conservatives across the board and it would be foolish not to think that effective patriots
[03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:45.680]  like uh sean hannity uh and tucker carlson rush limbaugh and others are not next so let's go
[03:48:46.240 --> 03:48:53.600]  to first of all pastor sam calling again from mexico always calling in with great questions
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:49:00.560]  and observations welcome to the alex jones show pastor sam hi roger great to talk to you
[03:49:00.560 --> 03:49:07.760]  uh i'd just like to point out that big wars they don't start in washington or even a murder
[03:49:09.200 --> 03:49:15.120]  unimportant corners of the world like the balkans the icky stands and in this case the
[03:49:15.120 --> 03:49:21.760]  banana republics and i believe that trump is pressing the issues there are so many corrupt
[03:49:21.760 --> 03:49:28.160]  politicians that are going to jail in country south america and central america right now
[03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:33.840]  i believe that trump has heard the cry of not only the people of the united states of america but
[03:49:33.840 --> 03:49:39.760]  of the americans as a whole and that political corruption is really starting to be cracked
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:45.440]  down on and setting a precedent for the jailing with people like the cadastres and hillary clinton
[03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:55.040]  well i like the sentiments of your call but i am not one who subscribes to some online theories
[03:49:55.040 --> 03:50:00.720]  that there are someplace hundreds of sealed indictments against some of the most leading
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:07.600]  criminals uh in the obama and clinton orbit or that jeff session has some secret plan that will
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:14.720]  suddenly be unveiled on a future given date proving that he isn't the worst attorney general in
[03:50:14.720 --> 03:50:22.240]  american history uh and that he is not supporting uh is uh boss the president uh but some kind of
[03:50:22.240 --> 03:50:29.600]  genius i just don't subscribe to that view what we clearly have in this country is the uneven
[03:50:32.160 --> 03:50:41.200]  application of justice where democrats uh and insiders are not held to the same legal standards
[03:50:41.200 --> 03:50:49.360]  as republicans and outsiders uh and where uh the instruments of government including uh
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:58.240]  surveillance uh in violation of our constitution uh are used uh in a witch hunt to try to not only
[03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:06.720]  deny down from the presidency but to create an insurance policy uh and a narrative to be used
[03:51:06.720 --> 03:51:15.920]  to take him down if in the improbable uh uh course of events he won the presidency it's a great call
[03:51:15.920 --> 03:51:21.680]  i thank you for calling uh pastor sam what's going on in mexico what do you see
[03:51:26.800 --> 03:51:33.520]  uh i wondered on the conditions in mexico the last time we spoke uh you had there was a great
[03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:43.520]  deal of violence and unrest okay i'm i'm sorry we've lost our caller let's go to uh jim in florida
[03:51:43.520 --> 03:51:50.640]  my home state jim in another call here if we can it's an honor and a privilege to talk to you
[03:51:50.640 --> 03:51:58.160]  mr stone thank you jim what's on your mind um i i there was only two points i had i'm a hundred
[03:51:58.160 --> 03:52:05.680]  percent disabled veteran uh former military officer uh i had my all expense paid vacation to
[03:52:05.680 --> 03:52:16.880]  beautiful sony southeast asia and uh that that wasn't such a good time but uh i have gotten 25
[03:52:16.880 --> 03:52:26.640]  people uh who are veterans to call up our local brevard county you know representative and uh
[03:52:27.200 --> 03:52:34.960]  to talk to our congress people and it's a small contribution but the thing is is that this
[03:52:34.960 --> 03:52:42.160]  internet censorship this violates our first amendment rights um we can't put up with
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:48.480]  and we've got to stand up to this and and if other veterans i don't care if they're disabled or
[03:52:49.360 --> 03:52:56.480]  quite well and healthy or what war they came from but if they if they could each get a lot of
[03:52:56.480 --> 03:53:02.800]  their friends to call up and complain it's like for every call one of the congressmen gets
[03:53:02.800 --> 03:53:08.560]  they know there's a hundred people that are annoyed with this situation and most people won't get off
[03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:16.960]  the couch pick up the phone and do something and i'm just trying to get everybody uh in particular
[03:53:16.960 --> 03:53:24.560]  veterans to get off the couch and do something well first of all obviously we thank you for your
[03:53:24.560 --> 03:53:33.040]  service secondarily a shout out to my many many friends in brevard county uh but uh the caller
[03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:39.920]  is absolutely right jim is absolutely right the key uh is to light up your congressmen about the
[03:53:39.920 --> 03:53:46.400]  dangers of internet censorship and the fact that even republican candidates for reelection
[03:53:46.400 --> 03:53:53.520]  will be disadvantaged as these uh tech left companies manipulate their political advertising
[03:53:53.520 --> 03:54:01.920]  rules and their standards to deny republicans equal access to this important medium so uh reach out
[03:54:01.920 --> 03:54:09.600]  now and contact your congressman whether you're a veteran or whether you are not uh i'm roger stone
[03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:17.680]  it has been my privilege to be here today on the alex jones show when they uh dropped this bomb of
[03:54:17.680 --> 03:54:24.320]  semper censorship on alex jones he told me something big is up this is the precursor of
[03:54:24.320 --> 03:54:31.680]  something big it is not no surprise to the listeners of uh info wars or the alex jones show
[03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:39.680]  that i have a runaway special prosecutor in robert miller investigating every aspect every molecule
[03:54:39.680 --> 03:54:47.600]  of my life my personal life my family life my political life my business life i reasonably
[03:54:47.600 --> 03:54:55.360]  that i was under a fisa warrant uh and illegally surveilled i think i have been on more recent
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:55:02.960]  under more recent surveillance and i can tell you definitively there is no russian collusion there is
[03:55:02.960 --> 03:55:10.320]  no wiki leagues collaboration there is a no nonsense regarding john pedestas emails there
[03:55:10.320 --> 03:55:19.600]  is no hacking of emails or any other material uh that is a conspiracy theory spun by the left
[03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:28.240]  but like alex jones i face multi-million dollar lawsuits sore loser suits from an obama affiliated
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:34.960]  in directed group on the left the democratic national committee uh a surging senate intelligence
[03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:41.920]  committee investigation the senate judiciary committee investigation and of course now we know
[03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:49.360]  as cnn has reported uh mr muller is investigating my finances numerous of my associates have been
[03:55:49.360 --> 03:55:55.920]  taken before a grand jury but i am guilty of no crime in connection with the 2016 election
[03:55:55.920 --> 03:56:03.120]  or anything else the witch hunt continues uh i am not a wealthy man online stories that say roger
[03:56:03.120 --> 03:56:11.040]  stone is worth 20 million our bogus uh posted most likely by david brock or some other left wing
