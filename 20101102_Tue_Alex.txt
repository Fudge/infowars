[00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.691]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.273]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:13.196]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:17.001]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.066]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:32.753]  Well, she's very busy tracking election fraud, and she normally gives her reports in the days after, and she'll be with us in the coming days.
[00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:34.814]  But Bev Harris is joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:41.957]  A black box of voting to go over all the irregularities and fraud that have been confirmed around the country.
[00:00:41.957 --> 00:00:45.199]  We then have William Gein joining us of Alipac.
[00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.743]  Dealing with all the evidence of illegal aliens being allowed to vote in places like Arizona and Nevada.
[00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:57.807]  He'll be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour today.
[00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:07.834]  We are going to cover a giant mass of incredibly important news and later I'm going to play some video from a helicopter.
[00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:24.888]  And there's also some surveillance footage from cameras on polls of people rioting last night in San Francisco when the Giants won the World Series against the Texas Rangers.
[00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:29.350]  Rioting over a baseball team winning the World Series.
[00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.756]  I saw the ABC News headline that the torture is over, wanting to know who was going to win.
[00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:46.481]  The torture, the torture of not knowing if people would be fulfilled in their lives by a baseball team winning a game.
[00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:52.384]  Instead of being fulfilled by getting a Bill of Rights Constitution back in place in this country.
[00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:58.507]  Instead of being fulfilled by securing the dollar, which is in free fall right now.
[00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:02.389]  Instead of securing jobs for themselves and a future for their children.
[00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:11.554]  No, they stayed up all night and were there this morning when the Giants arrived in San Francisco for an early morning press conference.
[00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:14.656]  They were there by the thousands worshipping them.
[00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:17.798]  Would they stay up all night to get their Bill of Rights and Constitution back?
[00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:18.399]  No, they wouldn't.
[00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:28.826]  And it's the screwed up priorities that the mainstream corporate media has force-fed this nation for decades that has allowed the type of tyranny to take root that we see.
[00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:32.409]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.950]  Meanwhile, a political organization
[00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.374]  Citizens Against Government Waste has put out a TV ad.
[00:02:39.374 --> 00:02:48.203]  We're going to be showing later as we stream live at PrisonPlanet.tv and it's also posted up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:56.771]  The television commercial about the national debt that is being banned by major networks and it shows the communist Chinese professor in a fictitious 2030
[00:02:58.373 --> 00:03:08.116]  Twenty years from now, teaching students about how the American empire fell and bragging that's why the Americans are basically our slaves today.
[00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:12.157]  Well, China is the number one owner of the fraudulent debt.
[00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:16.198]  The private Federal Reserve that teamed up with them to do this is the number two owner.
[00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:20.259]  And this ad is very accurate and should not be banned by
[00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:27.880]  ABC, A&E, History Channel, and many others that are refusing to show the ad.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:45.590]  We're going to work on next week, or maybe even later this week, getting Citizens Against Government Waste on to talk about this very well-produced TV ad that they attempted to put out to the American people, but it will not be censored here on this radio broadcast.
[00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:55.901]  Obviously after the break that's coming up here in just a minute, I'm going to get into the huge stack of election news and the giant Republican sweep that's taking place right now.
[00:03:55.901 --> 00:04:01.665]  We'll try to look at the different angles of that and what that really means going into the future of this country.
[00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:06.872]  We'll also look at the incredible financial news.
[00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:12.996]  Feds poised for biggest decision in decades coming up just in the next few days.
[00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:16.419]  They're announcing quantitative easing or dollar devaluation.
[00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.601]  QE2 risk currency wars and the end of the dollar hegemony.
[00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:22.863]  The end of the dollar is the world reserve currency.
[00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:24.344]  That's the London Telegraph.
[00:04:24.344 --> 00:04:27.727]  We also have last Friday's Christian Science Monitor that's important to remind you of.
[00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:33.168]  Is hard currency on its way out introducing the new virtual world currency?
[00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:37.769]  Bloomberg reports the Fed will announce at least 500 billion of U.S.
[00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:41.270]  bond buys, so they're now monetizing the debt.
[00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.391]  That's what Zimbabwe did, Weimar Republic Germany, Argentina in 2000, 2001.
[00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:49.272]  We know where this road leads.
[00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:52.733]  We'll be breaking that down as well and taking a lot of your phone calls.
[00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:53.213]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.213 --> 00:04:53.773]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:05.370]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.612]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:13.416]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:19.801]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:22.043]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.563 --> 00:05:22.863]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:22.863 --> 00:05:23.383]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:24.043]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:25.344]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.344 --> 00:05:27.584]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.468 --> 00:05:48.750]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:57.853]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.862]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:05.164]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:09.568]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:15.513]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:15.513 --> 00:06:17.655]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:20.338]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:27.183]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:29.384]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:29.384 --> 00:06:34.728]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:40.012]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:40.012 --> 00:06:45.176]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:48.578]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:06:48.578 --> 00:06:51.580]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.340]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:05.175]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:09.037]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.037 --> 00:07:11.338]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:17.201]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:23.884]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.884 --> 00:07:29.847]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.847 --> 00:07:33.549]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.313]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.313 --> 00:07:44.258]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.258 --> 00:07:47.822]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:49.803]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:50.924]  It's here.

[00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:09.674]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.674 --> 00:08:11.256]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:12.798]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.798 --> 00:08:17.004]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.004 --> 00:08:21.069]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.752 --> 00:08:34.582]  Matt Harris is coming up in about 25 minutes from now for black box voting to break down the evidence of election fraud going on around the country and even some people that have been indicted for it in places like Florida.
[00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:36.905]  We're going to get into the economy.
[00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:43.010]  We're going to get into big developments in places like France and the UK.
[00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.253]  France and UK plan unprecedented military cooperation.
[00:08:47.489 --> 00:08:56.392]  Basically merging their militaries, a lot of strange things going on and happening around the world right now.
[00:08:56.392 --> 00:09:07.936]  But let me first just get into this big stack of election news and obviously we'll be here tomorrow knowing a lot more after this historic November 2nd Super Tuesday.
[00:09:07.936 --> 00:09:10.757]  Let's go over it right now.
[00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:11.497]  Revival of
[00:09:19.753 --> 00:09:25.957]  Well, this is a Wall Street Journal article that says it shows major signals of historic era in U.S.
[00:09:25.957 --> 00:09:27.218]  politics.
[00:09:27.218 --> 00:09:30.080]  And there's a problem with this article.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:40.787]  It says voters this week look to set to do something not seen since the early 1950s, oust a substantial number of sitting House lawmakers for the third election in a row.
[00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:47.255]  And the Wall Street Journal goes on to say this will be the biggest political realignment in 80 years.
[00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:51.080]  And it says Republicans are voting in record numbers.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.986]  But most of these people are not establishment, rhino-type Republicans.
[00:09:56.897 --> 00:10:03.580]  They are individuals who are angry at the entire political system and are demanding change.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:17.207]  Similar to what we saw with Obama, a lot of people who never voted or who don't vote frequently going and voting for Obama in 2008, now two years ago today, and sweeping him into office.
[00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:21.290]  And you notice that within just six months, his approval rating began to plunge.
[00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:30.537]  To the lowest of any president at that point and continues to plunge two years in because people realize that it's business as usual.
[00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:44.149]  And this is accelerating now with Republicans as they take control of the House and maybe even the Senate, we'll find out by tomorrow, as all of this begins to basically become more clear.
[00:10:45.524 --> 00:11:06.417]  If the Republicans don't immediately deliver on repealing Obamacare, getting rid of NAFTA and GATT, cutting taxes, you are going to see the political realignment manifest itself by completely damaging the Republican and Democratic parties, and you're going to see the trend that we see beginning to emerge in places like Colorado
[00:11:06.897 --> 00:11:17.830]  With former Congressman Tom Tancredo now in most polls, two to five points ahead of the other challengers, including the Republican and the Democrat.
[00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:26.261]  And he's backed, of course, by the Constitution Party, something set up by G. Edward Griffin and Aaron Russo 20-something years ago.
[00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:33.306]  So you see that illustrated right there with Colorado and other states.
[00:11:33.306 --> 00:11:38.811]  People are going for the anti-establishment Democrats in the primaries that we saw in the last four months.
[00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:42.313]  They're going for the anti-establishment Republicans in the primaries.
[00:11:42.313 --> 00:11:48.578]  When Dick Cheney comes out and endorses the Republican running against Rand Paul, suddenly Rand Paul gets a surge.
[00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:50.320]  When Bill Clinton comes out and endorses
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.404]  Democrats against Republicans in Florida, Kentucky and other states.
[00:11:54.404 --> 00:11:54.684]  Boom!
[00:11:54.684 --> 00:11:59.929]  There's a huge surge for those that Bill Clinton is campaigning against.
[00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:09.197]  That's because anything that has a Republican flavor to it or a mainline Democratic flavor to it is dead on arrival.
[00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:14.543]  And listening to the ads here in Texas for mainline Republicans and Democrats,
[00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:25.807]  On radio and TV, they're saying, I'm anti-establishment, I'm pro-Tea Party, I wear a gun in my boot, you know, I want to fight the New World Order.
[00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:35.890]  And nowhere is this attempted Republican establishment takeover of the Tea Party more evident than what we see going on and
[00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:42.088]  happening big time with Rick Perry.
[00:12:42.088 --> 00:12:49.613]  Rick Perry is a guy that supported attempted forced inoculations of the deadly vaccine Gardasil for the papillomavirus.
[00:12:49.613 --> 00:12:58.257]  He's the guy that went to Bilderberg Group three years ago and was basically, you know, given the go-ahead to run for president in 2012.
[00:12:58.257 --> 00:13:04.141]  He's the gentleman who tried to ram through the North American Union trans-Texas corridor.
[00:13:05.101 --> 00:13:17.153]  He's the guy who has done so many horrible globalist type things, but he talks about how he shot a coyote in Westlake neighborhood in the middle of the city.
[00:13:17.153 --> 00:13:22.217]  He talks about how he wants Texas to secede and then later said it was just a joke.
[00:13:22.217 --> 00:13:27.302]  It's all rhetoric, but the positive news here is we don't have
[00:13:28.223 --> 00:13:38.125]  Republican candidates or Republican talk show host making fun of people that talk about global banking cartels and the private Federal Reserve.
[00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:42.286]  We don't see them making fun of people that want to shut down the borders.
[00:13:42.286 --> 00:13:45.707]  We don't see them making fun of anti-globalist.
[00:13:45.707 --> 00:13:48.368]  We now see them being forced to embrace it.
[00:13:48.368 --> 00:13:54.409]  So even though in a lot of cases it's political camouflage and it is a fraud, people
[00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:55.670]  We're good to go.
[00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:16.731]  I think?
[00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:53.318]  That is so important for all of our great activist listeners to get and to get out to everyone they know because it breaks down with just stunning clarity.
[00:14:54.278 --> 00:15:02.947]  Crystal clear focus how important it is that Ron Paul run for president and how he has a very good chance of winning.
[00:15:02.947 --> 00:15:05.189]  He's popular with mainline Republicans now.
[00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:12.416]  He's won most of the major straw polls, like the key CPAC poll at the big Republican convention earlier this year.
[00:15:13.436 --> 00:15:16.517]  And last year, when he came in second place then.
[00:15:16.517 --> 00:15:20.778]  He is hardcore patriot.
[00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:24.499]  He has a perfect voting record.
[00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:28.000]  I totally agree with all of his positions and policies.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.403]  I don't with Rand's, but still, a lot of that, I'm going to tell you, I can tell you on the day of the election, is political posturing.
[00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:38.063]  I'm just going to leave it at that, because, no.
[00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:44.034]  He's just like his dad, okay?
[00:15:44.034 --> 00:15:46.436]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:48.578]  But the issue here is that
[00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:54.894]  The Awakening is on, and we're not going to defeat the globalists overnight.
[00:15:54.894 --> 00:16:07.801]  And I was reading on InfoWars.com this morning some of the comments in Paul Joseph Watson's article and some of the other articles that we've written or posted dealing with voting and the election, with people saying, you're a bunch of idiots.
[00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.522]  Voting doesn't do anything.
[00:16:09.522 --> 00:16:11.363]  Voting is a complete failure.
[00:16:11.363 --> 00:16:12.324]  You know, you're an idiot.
[00:16:13.324 --> 00:16:15.226]  Well, look, there is election fraud.
[00:16:15.226 --> 00:16:16.748]  There are problems.
[00:16:16.748 --> 00:16:25.676]  The big mega corporations spend billions of dollars every election on trying to buy off the candidates or trying to get their candidates, you know, to the forefront.
[00:16:25.676 --> 00:16:28.119]  But we're in a fight with these people.
[00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:32.303]  By voting, we expose the election fraud in the sectors where it's evident.
[00:16:32.303 --> 00:16:33.984]  It's not going on everywhere.
[00:16:33.984 --> 00:16:35.126]  People go to prison.
[00:16:35.126 --> 00:16:36.247]  People get in trouble for it.
[00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.191]  You have to keep fighting.
[00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:52.438]  By supporting Patriot candidates, we begin to get our people in to be watchdogs, to have a bully pulpit, to be able to talk about real issues, and to position ourselves into the future.
[00:16:52.438 --> 00:16:54.959]  I mean, look at Ron Paul 20 years ago.
[00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:59.842]  He couldn't get one co-sponsor in Congress for his Audit the Fed bill.
[00:16:59.842 --> 00:17:06.165]  This year it passed the House, it was derailed and butchered in the Senate, but still, something came out of it.
[00:17:09.284 --> 00:17:20.550]  Look at the fact that for the first time in modern history, the puppets are being ignored and people are looking at the strings that lead up to the puppet master.
[00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:26.253]  And that's why in the major think tank reports and what Zbigniew Brzezinski has said and others, they are so scared.
[00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:32.137]  They are so concerned and trying to accelerate their program because they know the public is now awake.
[00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:35.038]  Now when you wake up, you gotta figure out where you are.
[00:17:35.038 --> 00:17:37.020]  You gotta figure out what's going on.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.262]  But the good news here is, we're not called kooks anymore.
[00:17:41.262 --> 00:17:57.673]  Oh sure, Media Matters and George Soros and MSNBC try to do it, but MSNBC during prime time has less listeners than a major syndicated radio show.
[00:17:57.673 --> 00:17:58.193]  It's a joke.
[00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:03.664]  And so they can't be the arbiters of reality anymore.
[00:18:03.664 --> 00:18:09.969]  They can't sit there and tell us we're kooks, we're lunatics, we're nuts because we talk about these real issues.
[00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:11.750]  They are the kooks now.
[00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.372]  People see that they're the ones out of touch.
[00:18:14.372 --> 00:18:25.381]  Folks, remember this radio show and Ron Paul and countless other Patriot talk show hosts and leaders talking about the real issues, talking about what Glass-Steagall was gonna do.
[00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:27.882]  And thousands of other issues.
[00:18:27.882 --> 00:18:32.064]  They remember us a year and a half ago telling you that they were saving the naked body images.
[00:18:32.064 --> 00:18:33.325]  Now it's admitted they were.
[00:18:33.325 --> 00:18:43.871]  They remember this show 10, 11, 12 years ago with medical doctors on and chemists and toxicologists about bisphenol A and other chemicals in plastics, reducing fertility in men, giving women breast cancer.
[00:18:44.511 --> 00:18:46.333]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:49.035]  They remember us talking about sodium fluoride and bone cancer.
[00:18:49.035 --> 00:18:50.296]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:54.940]  They remember us talking about NAFTA and GATT was going to destroy our economy and our industrial base.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.582]  Now it's no one can deny it.
[00:18:57.582 --> 00:19:00.925]  They heard us talk about China was going to become the biggest owner of our debt.
[00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:03.347]  How the Federal Reserve had teamed up with them to do this.
[00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:05.228]  How the Panama Canal had been given away.
[00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:07.850]  How the globalists were encircling and bankrupting the nation.
[00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.392]  Now it's admitted.
[00:19:09.392 --> 00:19:10.433]  We told the truth.
[00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:20.937]  We had the common sense, and we didn't care if we got made fun of, and laughed at, and demonized, and if the media tried to claim we were pushing violence when we weren't.
[00:19:20.937 --> 00:19:28.722]  Because we knew that the truth, an ounce of truth, can stand up against a million pounds of lies.
[00:19:28.722 --> 00:19:30.763]  Truth cuts through lies.
[00:19:30.763 --> 00:19:38.428]  And we've been there, planting the seeds over and over again, reaching out to people who laughed at us, but now they're not laughing.
[00:19:39.508 --> 00:19:41.790]  And so we've got a real chance.
[00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.093]  But this defeatist attitude of, oh, don't vote, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:45.093 --> 00:19:50.237]  I tend to agree with you that in most presidential elections it doesn't matter because they buy both candidates.
[00:19:50.237 --> 00:19:59.165]  But we're coming up to one in 2012 with Ron Paul, and he won't be able to fix everything, but it's another major move showing that we're the mainstream.
[00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:04.522]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:04.522 --> 00:20:06.403]  That something is Atwood Rope.
[00:20:06.403 --> 00:20:08.504]  The highest quality rope made in the USA.

[00:20:26.756 --> 00:20:27.637]  Atwood Rope.
[00:20:27.637 --> 00:20:29.518]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[00:20:30.018 --> 00:20:31.239]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:35.822]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:35.822 --> 00:20:41.626]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:41.626 --> 00:20:45.268]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:45.268 --> 00:20:47.990]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:53.053]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:53.294]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.695]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.238 --> 00:21:04.480]  You may be arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.741]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:09.482]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:21:09.482 --> 00:21:11.903]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:17.766]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:21:17.766 --> 00:21:24.009]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:30.410]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.591]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:21:34.591 --> 00:21:38.872]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:21:38.872 --> 00:21:44.813]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:21:44.813 --> 00:21:48.373]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:50.354]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:21:50.354 --> 00:21:50.774]  It's here.

[00:21:59.656 --> 00:22:03.737]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:03.737 --> 00:22:09.618]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:09.618 --> 00:22:14.759]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:29.230]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:34.835]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:34.835 --> 00:22:40.719]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:46.922]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:22:46.922 --> 00:22:46.982]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:01.044]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[00:23:01.044 --> 00:23:03.446]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[00:23:03.446 --> 00:23:11.354]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[00:24:12.478 --> 00:24:20.645]  In our 2007 film, Endgame, we end the documentary bullhorning the Governor's Mansion with Rick Perry inside of it.
[00:24:20.645 --> 00:24:25.210]  That was right before he moved out of the Governor's Mansion.
[00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.492]  And now he's got his book coming out, fed up.
[00:24:28.492 --> 00:24:30.795]  He's talking about how he wants to battle the New World Order.
[00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:34.037]  Meanwhile, he's hanging out at the Bilderberg Group.
[00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:36.540]  But you notice, we said he's getting ready to run for President.
[00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:50.068]  Coming up in 2012 in my film, Endgame, and you watch, it's going to be Rick Perry, probably with Sarah Palin as Vice President.
[00:24:50.068 --> 00:24:55.251]  Mark my words, you heard it here first, that is in the cards at the top of the deck.
[00:24:56.195 --> 00:25:10.899]  Rick Perry with Sarah Palin, a powerhouse ticket, and you've got Sarah Palin who says all the right things, does all the right things, except for fear-mongering, for fake terror, and more wars, which is the neocon aspect.
[00:25:10.899 --> 00:25:13.280]  I mean, she's doing the right thing endorsing Rand Paul.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.782]  She's doing the right thing endorsing Tom Tancredo, above the Republican candidate.
[00:25:17.782 --> 00:25:22.023]  And Tom Tancredo is set to win in all the major polls unless there's election fraud.
[00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:26.385]  Harry Reid is set to lose against Sharon Angle unless there's election fraud.
[00:25:26.385 --> 00:25:33.788]  And now they're saying, oh, because of all the allegations of election fraud, we may not find out until December.
[00:25:33.788 --> 00:25:37.809]  But mark my words, that's why I waited on this Tea Party film.
[00:25:37.809 --> 00:25:43.832]  I was going to mainly make it about Glenn Beck and the media, but I'm going to really make it about the different Republican candidates.
[00:25:43.832 --> 00:25:47.093]  Mitt Romney, General Petraeus, they're in the cards.
[00:25:47.093 --> 00:25:50.654]  Mitt Romney and Petraeus, maybe together, maybe separate.
[00:25:50.654 --> 00:25:52.175]  But the powerhouse ticket.
[00:25:53.581 --> 00:26:03.006]  And I already saw this coming several years ago, but now it's being talked about by the Texas Monthly, it's being talked about by the local analyst.
[00:26:03.006 --> 00:26:11.451]  Rick Perry told the AP yesterday, he said, don't be surprised if I only serve a year or two as governor in his four-year term.
[00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:16.034]  If he does serve a full term, it'll be 14 years or the longest serving Texas governor in history.
[00:26:17.349 --> 00:26:26.796]  He is positioned, he's got the book, he's got the book tour, he's launching, he'll probably announce he's running for president in the next six to ten months.
[00:26:26.796 --> 00:26:44.248]  And then Sarah Hot Mama Palin is gonna be VP again, up against Hillary Clinton, probably running for president.
[00:26:45.353 --> 00:26:46.693]  And then that'll be the new novelty.
[00:26:46.693 --> 00:26:48.114]  Oh, do you want Hillary as president?
[00:26:48.114 --> 00:26:49.334]  The first woman president?
[00:26:49.334 --> 00:26:50.734]  And a lot of women will get into it.
[00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:52.774]  Oh, we'll have change if it's a woman.
[00:26:52.774 --> 00:26:57.475]  Oh, yeah, a woman who headed up the White House 11 years ago when they got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[00:26:57.475 --> 00:27:04.377]  I love Democrats always talking about how it's Republicans that cause the economic collapse.
[00:27:04.377 --> 00:27:05.477]  Well, that's true.
[00:27:05.477 --> 00:27:14.219]  One wing on the bird, the right wing, is the Republican leadership desperately trying to keep control of their party.
[00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:14.979]  But the other wing
[00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:18.210]  I don't know.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.362]  So we need to start having the discussion here on air.
[00:27:42.362 --> 00:27:49.246]  Are Republicans and Libertarians, are you all going to go to sleep now when the Republicans win the House?
[00:27:49.246 --> 00:28:07.035]  Are you going to go along with whatever the Republicans do, because at least they're better than Obama and the Democrats, and they're fighting with the Democrats, and so people kind of turn their thinking process off and go along with whatever the Republicans are doing, because Republicans will feel like they're part of the power structure.
[00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:17.379]  I don't think that's going to happen because the economic implosion, the depression we're entering, is so bad, that has a way of getting people to think straight.
[00:28:17.379 --> 00:28:18.940]  To get their minds straight.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.981]  To get their heads screwed on, facing forward.
[00:28:23.981 --> 00:28:30.263]  So are Republicans and Libertarians and Tea Party people, are they going to go back to sleep when the Republicans take the House?
[00:28:30.263 --> 00:28:33.424]  Maybe even the Senate if there's not election fraud?
[00:28:33.424 --> 00:28:34.965]  Will you go back to sleep again?
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.724]  Because your team, you know, wins the World Series or wins the Super Bowl.
[00:28:41.724 --> 00:28:48.409]  Or are you going to continue to move to take back the states and get more patriotic candidates elected?
[00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:56.475]  If you go back two years ago, right when Obama got elected, Republicans and Democrats were being shut down at town halls everywhere, and we're going to go back to that.
[00:28:58.391 --> 00:29:22.135]  I believe that despite the fact that the mainstream media is going to try to re-energize the left-right paradigm, that you're going to see the fact that Republicans and Democrats are going to be sharing power now, that you're going to see an anti-incumbency and an anti-Republican-Democrat fervor accelerate, the key words accelerate, and dwarf what we're seeing with people like Tom Tancredo set to win in Colorado.
[00:29:24.164 --> 00:29:27.585]  Unless there's election fraud today, which no doubt there probably is.
[00:29:27.585 --> 00:29:29.146]  Doesn't matter.
[00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:40.089]  Just the fact that a third-party candidate out of nowhere is about to become governor, or has a good shot at it, shows how deep this political realignment is.
[00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:43.470]  And all the political analysts, even mainstream analysts, admit this is the case.
[00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:49.051]  We're going to look at election fraud straight ahead with Bev Harris, then we'll start looking at races around the country, and your phone call.
[00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:50.452]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.452 --> 00:29:51.852]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.852 --> 00:29:53.353]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:57.059]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.154 --> 00:30:04.336]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:10.740]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:18.124]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:18.124 --> 00:30:23.007]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:30:31.662 --> 00:30:35.393]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:30:35.922 --> 00:30:42.685]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:30:42.685 --> 00:30:46.566]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:30:54.009 --> 00:30:54.469]  Thank you.
[00:31:00.814 --> 00:31:16.288]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.288 --> 00:31:19.972]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:20.973 --> 00:31:33.745]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:33.745 --> 00:31:41.012]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:41.693 --> 00:31:52.062]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:31:52.062 --> 00:31:56.005]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:31:56.005 --> 00:31:59.108]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:31:59.628 --> 00:32:04.189]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:05.089]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:08.510]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.370]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.271]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.271 --> 00:32:15.011]  It's true.
[00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:19.871]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:20.712]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.712 --> 00:32:24.292]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.292 --> 00:32:28.193]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.193 --> 00:32:28.473]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.993 --> 00:32:31.754]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.754 --> 00:32:35.435]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.435 --> 00:32:36.236]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.236 --> 00:32:40.377]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.377 --> 00:32:45.419]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:49.601]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:51.381]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:55.923]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1
[00:32:56.483 --> 00:32:58.624]  877-327-0365.
[00:32:58.624 --> 00:33:13.413]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.413 --> 00:33:24.599]  Next hour we're going to have wide open phones on the election, the economy, what you think is going to come out of this Republican takeover of the House, maybe even the Senate.
[00:33:24.599 --> 00:33:25.880]  Will people go back to sleep?
[00:33:27.702 --> 00:33:30.265]  Or will the political realignment continue?
[00:33:30.265 --> 00:33:34.469]  We're going to be discussing all of that coming up today.
[00:33:34.469 --> 00:33:39.914]  And I've got a big stack of election news I'm going to cover here right after Bev Harris leaves us.
[00:33:39.914 --> 00:33:42.697]  Of course, she made the documentary film that aired on HBO.
[00:33:44.538 --> 00:33:54.928]  The website is blackboxvoting.org and she's one of the preeminent researchers out there exposing these electronic voting machines that have gone in all over the country.
[00:33:54.928 --> 00:34:01.355]  And we've seen the same old stories, whatever party is in power, magically the voting machines in the case of Nevada and other areas
[00:34:01.715 --> 00:34:01.855]  Oh, hi.
[00:34:01.855 --> 00:34:02.975]  It's always good to be with you, Alex.
[00:34:28.084 --> 00:34:30.726]  I'm in Kentucky.
[00:34:30.726 --> 00:34:34.870]  You know, it looks like Kentucky's going to go for Rand Paul, but you never know nowadays.
[00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.912]  Some of the most implausible results happen.
[00:34:37.912 --> 00:34:39.914]  So I definitely wanted to be on the ground here.
[00:34:39.914 --> 00:34:46.559]  And I'm also checking into a local sheriff's race in Bullitt County, Kentucky, the aptly named Bullitt County.
[00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:53.565]  A very controversial race in a high-crime county where a popular cop is pitted against an incumbent sheriff.
[00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:57.809]  But, you know, I'm also bouncing back and forth a little bit.
[00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:02.495]  I was down in Memphis, Tennessee for a good bit of the last couple months.
[00:35:02.495 --> 00:35:08.582]  And I'm also expecting to see some interesting things in Washington State and Colorado.
[00:35:08.582 --> 00:35:12.146]  But I tell you, this set of elections is going to be
[00:35:13.422 --> 00:35:17.644]  I've never seen so many close races, or purported to be close.
[00:35:17.644 --> 00:35:18.264]  You never know.
[00:35:18.264 --> 00:35:22.186]  You don't know if the polls are right, you don't know if the machines are right.
[00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:27.169]  You know, everything is pretty much concealed from the public, so we're just sort of going on faith.
[00:35:27.169 --> 00:35:33.732]  What do we know so far dealing with bizarre activities with the voting machines?
[00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:42.250]  Well, you know, you really called it whoever is controlling the machines is ultimately in power.
[00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:52.412]  What I'm seeing now that is really quite creepy is that the election officials are just blatantly handing it over to the vendors.
[00:35:52.412 --> 00:35:59.434]  Private companies here in Kentucky, they actually have an administrative code now where the election official
[00:36:00.094 --> 00:36:13.345]  Appoint an administrator of the election and the person they're appointing is someone who works for a private company called Harp Enterprises, which controls 96 out of Kentucky's 120 counties.
[00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:14.987]  How wrong is that?
[00:36:14.987 --> 00:36:22.613]  What they're doing is they're actually taking and programming each election in their private office in Lexington.
[00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:25.756]  Then they come in and you see the county clerks just
[00:36:25.856 --> 00:36:27.277]  What is the name?
[00:36:27.277 --> 00:36:31.380]  Did you appoint a name of a person or did you appoint a company to run your election?
[00:36:47.862 --> 00:36:49.942]  I mean, how wrong is that?
[00:36:49.942 --> 00:36:55.984]  We have the public that can't even hold anyone accountable because it's some nameless person from a private company.
[00:36:55.984 --> 00:36:58.384]  Now, just Memphis, same thing.
[00:36:58.384 --> 00:37:05.305]  Big, huge company out of Omaha, Nebraska called Election Systems and Software, which bought Diebold and then divested itself.
[00:37:05.305 --> 00:37:09.986]  Well, they are running most of the elections in the U.S., even though they sold Diebold.
[00:37:09.986 --> 00:37:11.847]  They're running about two-thirds of the elections.
[00:37:14.293 --> 00:37:29.786]  In a deposition, the local administrators for the election admitted, remoted into their computer on election day to adjust something, and also gave them the database that they used to configure their election.
[00:37:29.786 --> 00:37:41.356]  It was all done out of state by a private vendor, and when candidates took them to court, they said they could not even subpoena the private vendor to answer any questions because they were out of state.
[00:37:41.696 --> 00:38:04.858]  Bev, recap for people just in a few minutes some of the big frauds that you yourself have discovered and caught them red-handed in and some of the others that have come out in the last few elections just to remind people of the fact that we've had executives quit the companies that admit they were hired to engage in fraud, that the computer programs are designed for them to be able to hack in and then cover their tracks.
[00:38:04.858 --> 00:38:06.500]  I mean, this is so brazen.
[00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:11.386]  Yeah, and again, what we're looking at, people think it's outside hackers, but it's not.
[00:38:11.386 --> 00:38:15.487]  It's the insiders, as has always been the case with election fraud.
[00:38:15.487 --> 00:38:26.849]  And so, the real crime here is that we're concealing the process from the public, which actually transfers power to the insiders and removes our democratic process.
[00:38:26.849 --> 00:38:27.749]  It's really that serious.
[00:38:27.749 --> 00:38:32.871]  But some of the things that I've personally witnessed, in Volusia County, Florida in 2004,
[00:38:35.007 --> 00:38:39.729]  We saw a group of election officials signing poll tapes.
[00:38:39.729 --> 00:38:48.472]  Now, this was several days after the election, and what that means is the poll tape is the closest to the voting machine report of results.
[00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:55.694]  What they were doing is counterfeiting results tapes from the voting machine, signing off on them, and substituting them for the real thing.
[00:38:55.694 --> 00:39:00.016]  We found the real ones in the trash and compared them, and some of them were off by hundreds of votes.
[00:39:00.928 --> 00:39:15.764]  Now, in New Hampshire in 2008, we saw an absolute charade when they took the voting machines that were programmed by this private company and they were supposed to recount the ballots.
[00:39:15.764 --> 00:39:22.010]  They had paper ballots, but they had an absolute charade in terms of their chain of custody.
[00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.891]  They were buying
[00:39:25.673 --> 00:39:30.156]  They were leaving ballots on purpose in unlocked rooms.
[00:39:30.156 --> 00:39:37.800]  They were running around the county, you know, around the state in a white van driven by two clerks named Butch and Hoppy.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.642]  I mean, it was absolutely surreal.
[00:39:40.642 --> 00:39:47.645]  So really what we were seeing, there was really a ballot swapping operation to make the recount match the machine count.
[00:39:47.645 --> 00:39:50.107]  And, you know, in Memphis,
[00:39:50.922 --> 00:40:01.165]  We saw in just this last August election just an incredible amount of obstructiveness where they actually had to bring the judge down in a lawsuit.
[00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:07.847]  The judge ended up at the election center ordering them to give up stuff that they refused to give up.
[00:40:07.847 --> 00:40:09.648]  How surreal is this?
[00:40:09.648 --> 00:40:13.869]  In Memphis, they would not give anyone the results of the election.
[00:40:15.362 --> 00:40:16.302]  You heard me.
[00:40:16.302 --> 00:40:17.863]  They wouldn't give up their own results.
[00:40:17.863 --> 00:40:21.324]  They basically announced that these are the winners, trust us.
[00:40:21.324 --> 00:40:28.126]  And when the candidates asked for the detailed results sheets, they said they didn't exist, couldn't get them, couldn't find them.
[00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:32.807]  Even after they certified it, it took a lawyer to get them to give up the results.
[00:40:32.807 --> 00:40:41.310]  And in a sworn affidavit, when it went to court, they declared that the results they gave up, after certification, were non-existent.
[00:40:42.628 --> 00:40:50.215]  I mean, it is so down-the-rabbit-hole surreal when you really get out there in the field and watch what they're doing.
[00:40:50.854 --> 00:40:52.896]  And they're doing it in plain view.
[00:40:52.896 --> 00:41:12.112]  Now, obviously, the different political power structures that are fighting for control over what voting machine company they pick for a state or a region, that this isn't, from your research and from my own research, one big monolithic system, but different cartels fighting with each other.
[00:41:12.112 --> 00:41:16.656]  You mentioned some of the states where you're seeing the really serious red flags.
[00:41:16.656 --> 00:41:18.798]  I want to go over Washington State,
[00:41:19.558 --> 00:41:24.225]  Uh, Kentucky, Florida, some of the states you mentioned, but what about Nevada?
[00:41:24.225 --> 00:41:30.333]  Uh, where... Well, yeah.
[00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:31.395]  Let's talk about that.
[00:41:31.395 --> 00:41:32.296]  No, go ahead.
[00:41:32.296 --> 00:41:33.298]  No, no, I mean, let's talk about that.
[00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:41.988]  Yeah, well, you know, Clark County, Nevada, which is Las Vegas, has just been historically crooked, as far back as anyone remembers.
[00:41:41.988 --> 00:41:44.350]  But this is actually nothing new.
[00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:46.773]  I'm just so glad to see it's getting into the press.
[00:41:46.773 --> 00:41:53.480]  Yes, people go to the polls, they see their touchscreen voting machine ballot pre-marked for Harry Reid.
[00:41:54.441 --> 00:42:04.651]  This is actually, as I say, this has been happening in every election where people find pre-marked ballots and sometimes with paper ballots as well, you know, they're picking up their ballot and it's pre-marked.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.441]  Nevada, would you expect anything else?
[00:42:10.441 --> 00:42:18.004]  We do definitely see a preponderance of problems in areas that are based on a gambling economy.
[00:42:18.004 --> 00:42:21.105]  And I think we shouldn't be too surprised about that.
[00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:34.609]  Atlantic City had inside absentee fraud in 2009 where the people working inside their elections office eventually pled guilty to just adding in, you know, basically voter ID
[00:42:35.209 --> 00:42:40.213]  And we're also seeing the military not being sent their ballots or the ballots not coming back.
[00:42:40.213 --> 00:42:41.734]  I mean, this just goes on and on and on.
[00:43:02.267 --> 00:43:10.070]  Yeah, you know, it's turned into something where I think people think that people don't care, and I sometimes feel that way too.
[00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.752]  They're always trying to justify that it really must be okay when it's so clearly not.
[00:43:14.752 --> 00:43:18.773]  But I think it's a situation where a lot of people feel helpless.
[00:43:18.773 --> 00:43:22.715]  They think, you know, this is just so surreal.
[00:43:22.715 --> 00:43:24.055]  I don't understand it.
[00:43:24.055 --> 00:43:27.816]  It's complexified to the point that nobody can follow the bouncing ball.
[00:43:29.777 --> 00:43:39.004]  You know, it's not the first time in history that we've had a basic human right, like our own sovereignty over our government, challenged or even taken away.
[00:43:39.004 --> 00:43:41.906]  And we have to get in there and engage.
[00:43:41.906 --> 00:43:46.369]  You have to vote because that casts evidence.
[00:43:46.369 --> 00:43:57.897]  I went to the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis shortly before I left, and one thing that struck me is they said, you know, if you decide not to vote, you have committed voluntary disenfranchisement.
[00:43:58.775 --> 00:43:59.676]  Don't do that.
[00:43:59.676 --> 00:44:02.797]  Don't just hand it to them.
[00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:03.257]  Exactly.
[00:44:03.257 --> 00:44:07.439]  The system wants you to become disenfranchised and just give up.
[00:44:07.439 --> 00:44:14.923]  But we've gone from 10 years ago in national polls where what, 3, 4, 5 percent questioned the integrity of the system.
[00:44:14.923 --> 00:44:15.863]  Bev, talk about that.
[00:44:15.863 --> 00:44:20.906]  I've seen national polls the last few years where upwards of 90 percent questioned the integrity.
[00:44:21.246 --> 00:44:24.247]  And we now hear about all of the mortgage fraud by the big banks.
[00:44:24.247 --> 00:44:29.508]  We hear about Prudential and others signing secret deals to steal the death benefits of veterans.
[00:44:29.508 --> 00:44:39.470]  I mean, really, it's not so much that things are getting more corrupt, and I think they are at certain levels, it's that we're starting to learn just how corrupt they are, and it's a process.
[00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:45.271]  And by voting, by running for office, by being politically engaged, we expose this
[00:44:45.851 --> 00:44:54.120]  And it seems like there's nothing we can do, but then boom, suddenly the corruption comes out and the scallywags that have done this get in a lot of trouble.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:59.026]  And we are starting to see indictments and arrests around the country of elections officials engaged in fraud.
[00:44:59.932 --> 00:45:00.573]  We are.
[00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:01.013]  We are.
[00:45:01.013 --> 00:45:08.839]  And, you know, here in Kentucky, though, let me mention, that's one of the famous ones where an election official was convicted of fraud.
[00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:11.241]  Actually, Clay County, Kentucky, is just historic.
[00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:19.248]  One of the election officials committed arson and they burned down something in some kind of drug deal and then, you know, they had another one.
[00:45:19.248 --> 00:45:21.390]  But what I noticed here in Kentucky is
[00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:32.575]  Now what Kentucky has done is they have tried to consolidate it to this one private vendor named Harp Enterprises, which now controls 96 out of the 120 counties.
[00:45:32.575 --> 00:45:41.699]  The people and the election officials being investigated and indicted were only the ones who chose not to go with this centralized vendor.
[00:45:41.699 --> 00:45:42.920]  Now isn't that interesting?
[00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.231]  Yeah, get them out of the way!
[00:45:45.231 --> 00:45:49.214]  You know, maybe we can get the next one to come with this centralized vendor.
[00:45:49.214 --> 00:45:55.538]  I've seen some very corrupt things going on in Kentucky, but they... Well, let's not glaze over that.
[00:45:55.538 --> 00:45:59.480]  ...don't get investigated, don't get prosecuted.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.762]  Excuse me, let's not glaze over that.
[00:46:01.762 --> 00:46:09.366]  Whoever's being investigated, those are the only counties that don't get consolidated, because the real fraud's going on with the consolidation.
[00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:11.668]  They want to firewall off those investigations.
[00:46:12.602 --> 00:46:13.483]  There you go, you know.
[00:46:42.602 --> 00:46:47.085]  They're very corrupt and have a history of political and election corruption.
[00:46:47.085 --> 00:46:50.448]  They're the same old places that were controlled by the crime bosses.
[00:46:50.448 --> 00:46:54.871]  Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, New York, New Jersey, Las Vegas.
[00:46:54.871 --> 00:46:58.393]  I mean, and then it sort of fans out from some of these places.
[00:46:58.393 --> 00:47:05.939]  Omaha, by the way, which has the largest voting machine company in the country, was definitely part of the Capone network.
[00:47:06.939 --> 00:47:09.342]  What about Houston?
[00:47:09.342 --> 00:47:16.368]  That bizarre fire they had after a questioned election where the voting machines all burned up?
[00:47:16.368 --> 00:47:18.530]  Well, yes, I read about that.
[00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:19.491]  I guess no comment.
[00:47:19.491 --> 00:47:28.240]  I don't know what caused the fire, but in some ways, you know, a little part of you over here rejoiced because, well, maybe they'll get something better, but apparently they didn't.
[00:47:30.732 --> 00:47:39.802]  The move to try to corporatize it and start this finger-pointing game where the election official says, oh, I can't answer that.
[00:47:39.802 --> 00:47:40.843]  Only the vendor can.
[00:47:40.843 --> 00:47:44.246]  And the vendor says, well, I can't answer that because I don't have to because I'm out of state.
[00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:55.897]  That's a bad part, but really, when you get down to the very core of this, where we've gone wrong is we've allowed essential processes in the election to be concealed from the public.
[00:47:55.897 --> 00:48:03.719]  And as long as you keep that as your litmus test, as what is an okay system and what is not, you start getting meaningful change.
[00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:09.040]  Germany has banned its electronic voting systems on human rights grounds.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.961]  Basically, what they've said is that
[00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:21.651]  Any system that conceals from the public the essential processes in the election is unconstitutional because it removes sovereignty over the government.
[00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:24.775]  And that's a pre-eminent first world nation.
[00:48:24.775 --> 00:48:26.376]  And this is fundamental.
[00:48:26.376 --> 00:48:31.441]  Stalin said, I don't care who you vote for, all I care about is who counts the votes.
[00:48:32.202 --> 00:48:32.282]  And
[00:48:52.102 --> 00:48:53.743]  Corporate crime investigator.
[00:48:53.743 --> 00:48:58.465]  So that's why she's had so much expertise and success in this as she gets down on the ground.
[00:48:58.465 --> 00:49:00.346]  But it sounds from what you're saying.
[00:49:00.346 --> 00:49:04.288]  Don't expect Sharon Engel to win just because she's ahead in most of the polls.
[00:49:04.288 --> 00:49:11.731]  Don't expect Rand Paul to win even though he's 15 points ahead in some polls because the establishment clearly doesn't want
[00:49:12.051 --> 00:49:22.055]  Rand Paul, but we've seen from past elections that if there is a huge wave, sometimes they get scared and don't engage in fraud because they're scared of investigations.
[00:49:22.055 --> 00:49:31.599]  And I'm glad that Sharon Angle has now pointed out the fraud because now they're saying there is going to be an investigation, but then the problem is the investigators are the same one involved in the fraud.
[00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:39.922]  Right, and you have a good point there in that if there's a huge wave, and that's why people should vote, it is very challenging to tamper with it in a credible way.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:47.904]  Because then you have the exit polls, you have the people, you have the public polls that don't match.
[00:49:47.904 --> 00:49:49.885]  These crooks don't like that.
[00:49:49.885 --> 00:49:57.229]  Well, they don't like a light to shine on it, and they certainly don't like a lot of very energized people coming in and saying we'd like to look at everything.
[00:49:57.229 --> 00:50:01.671]  Because then you've got to have a fire at the ballot box place.
[00:50:01.671 --> 00:50:02.852]  There you go.
[00:50:02.852 --> 00:50:04.433]  That's happened in Texas, as you know.
[00:50:05.279 --> 00:50:13.991]  So this mafia is, it sounds like, getting this institutionalized, but in other parts of the world, people are seeing through it.
[00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:18.357]  I mean, are there any successes reversing this fraud?
[00:50:19.377 --> 00:50:25.502]  Well, you know, Germany has been followed by the Netherlands and Ireland in getting rid of these machines.
[00:50:25.502 --> 00:50:27.384]  They're in warehouses just mothballed.
[00:50:27.384 --> 00:50:29.326]  They said, this doesn't work, it's not democratic.
[00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:36.432]  And by the way, there's four essential processes that have to be available to the public for authentication without need for special expertise.
[00:50:36.432 --> 00:50:39.275]  And those are who can vote, the voter list.
[00:50:39.835 --> 00:50:40.716]  Who did vote?
[00:50:40.716 --> 00:50:42.216]  The participating voter list.
[00:50:42.216 --> 00:50:46.839]  Whether the ballot that gets counted is the same one that got cast, which is chain of custody.
[00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:50.061]  And the counting of the vote, meaning a public counting of the vote.
[00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:53.002]  There's three nations in Europe that have steamed through this.
[00:50:53.002 --> 00:50:55.063]  It's really the Emperor's New Clothes, that's all it is.
[00:50:55.063 --> 00:50:55.944]  Bev, stay there.
[00:50:55.944 --> 00:50:59.106]  And by continuing to expose it, the House of Cards will fall.
[00:50:59.106 --> 00:50:59.486]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.345 --> 00:51:02.606]  Do you know someone who's a Constitution basher?
[00:51:02.606 --> 00:51:06.029]  Then here's the ammo you need to silence them once and for all.
[00:51:06.029 --> 00:51:07.950]  Introducing the crash course on the U.S.
[00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:13.033]  Constitution, how to argue with a liberal about constitutional issues and win every time.
[00:51:13.033 --> 00:51:19.357]  If you believe it's time we stop disgusting left-wing lies and start telling the truth about America's Christian heritage, this crash
[00:51:19.397 --> 00:51:21.518]  Crash Course for Patriots is for you!
[00:51:21.518 --> 00:51:27.703]  Start neutralizing the liberal propaganda being force-fed in our schools, the workplace, and the media.
[00:51:27.703 --> 00:51:29.004]  The Crash Course on the U.S.
[00:51:29.004 --> 00:51:35.008]  Constitution is an audio power program that includes six CDs jam-packed with amazing information and
[00:51:35.128 --> 00:51:35.628]  Let's do it!
[00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:05.032]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.032 --> 00:52:06.013]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.013 --> 00:52:08.454]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:08.454 --> 00:52:09.475]  A republic.
[00:52:09.475 --> 00:52:12.116]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.116 --> 00:52:14.378]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.378 --> 00:52:16.399]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:18.100]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.401]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.401 --> 00:52:20.021]  Children?
[00:52:20.021 --> 00:52:21.142]  Our education?
[00:52:21.142 --> 00:52:21.983]  Our money?
[00:52:21.983 --> 00:52:25.625]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:25.985 --> 00:52:29.690]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:30.952]  You are being warned.
[00:52:30.952 --> 00:52:31.973]  We have the facts.
[00:52:31.973 --> 00:52:33.134]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.134 --> 00:52:34.056]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.056 --> 00:52:34.937]  We have common law.
[00:52:34.937 --> 00:52:37.460]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:41.245]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.345 --> 00:52:46.290]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:47.792]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:47.792 --> 00:52:48.893]  Don't tread on me.

[00:54:07.614 --> 00:54:09.595]  Okay, Ben Harris, you've got the floor.
[00:54:09.595 --> 00:54:15.898]  You were going over those four things that even major governments in Europe, like Germany, have stated are fundamental.
[00:54:15.898 --> 00:54:27.865]  I mean, private secretive groups that have been caught in fraud and election rigging over and over again, and their own executives have gone public, and airplanes have gone down, and people have been killed and shot who go public.
[00:54:27.865 --> 00:54:29.966]  I mean, we know there's fraud going on everywhere.
[00:54:31.066 --> 00:54:37.031]  And the denial is really starting to end, and it's bipartisan corruption going on.
[00:54:37.031 --> 00:54:40.494]  So, how do we get our election process back?
[00:54:41.749 --> 00:54:46.992]  Well, one thing I want to say is, although we hear about these scary things, don't be scared to engage.
[00:54:46.992 --> 00:54:49.014]  It really isn't all that dangerous out in the field.
[00:54:49.014 --> 00:54:54.717]  You just need to make sure that you're, you know, going after something in a public way, which is your right.
[00:54:54.717 --> 00:54:57.519]  Yeah, no, I'm not... I'm not trying to scare people.
[00:54:57.519 --> 00:55:00.261]  They don't really usually kill investigators for my research.
[00:55:00.261 --> 00:55:01.862]  It's insiders who've blown the whistle.
[00:55:02.495 --> 00:55:08.619]  Right, and I'm saying that because I meet a lot of people in the public who are scared, and they don't need to be scared is what I'm saying.
[00:55:08.619 --> 00:55:10.700]  They need to engage.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.442]  Because when we do, it's the public officials who get scared.
[00:55:14.442 --> 00:55:23.067]  Now, one of the things that we need to do is keep our eye on the ball as far as what is meaningful reform and what is just make work running on a hamster wheel.
[00:55:23.427 --> 00:55:31.513]  We've seen a lot of that where they divert people into, you know, all of a thunderedown mistrail to something that doesn't even really mean very much.
[00:55:31.513 --> 00:55:36.337]  Like, you know, let's do a one-half a percent audit two weeks after the election.
[00:55:36.337 --> 00:55:38.398]  By that time, chain of custody is toast.
[00:55:38.398 --> 00:55:42.621]  And would you have a bank account where you could look at only one-half of one percent of your checks?
[00:55:43.602 --> 00:55:46.587]  Um, you know, so we need to look at what's meaningful.
[00:55:46.587 --> 00:55:53.176]  And what's meaningful is what we want is the public to be able to see and authenticate the original count.
[00:55:53.176 --> 00:55:54.999]  That doesn't mean something two weeks later.
[00:55:54.999 --> 00:55:58.665]  That means the original count before it goes anywhere at the polling place.
[00:55:59.125 --> 00:56:01.327]  There's places that are doing this.
[00:56:01.327 --> 00:56:08.992]  In fact, there's kind of some halfway measures that are meaningful in Humboldt County, California, and now Yolo County, California has added this.
[00:56:08.992 --> 00:56:21.720]  They just bought an off-the-shelf scanner from, you know, Office Depot, and they're taking all their ballots and also running them through that scanner and making them available to the public on CD and putting them on the web.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.520]  They're anonymous.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.762]  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
[00:56:24.762 --> 00:56:25.843]  That is powerful because...
[00:56:26.363 --> 00:56:29.617]  Because then you can have somewhat of an audit later and they can't burn them down.
[00:56:30.635 --> 00:56:32.676]  Right, well, and it doesn't even need to be later.
[00:56:32.676 --> 00:56:43.999]  I mean, they're putting them out right away, and you can see, you can count them yourself, and there's even a wonderful guy by the name of Mitch Trachtenberg, who has developed free Open First software that he hopes everyone else will just develop their own.
[00:56:43.999 --> 00:56:45.839]  It's not that hard to do.
[00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:54.542]  And, you know, so if you don't want to count 170,000 ballots one by one, you can also use this free software and check different precincts yourself, and then look at them yourself.
[00:56:54.542 --> 00:56:55.642]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:56:55.642 --> 00:56:58.163]  The point being that this is not expensive,
[00:56:58.843 --> 00:57:03.984]  And it's very, very public, and it brings the public and allows them to see what's going on.
[00:57:03.984 --> 00:57:08.625]  But we have to keep remembering that what we want is a public count.
[00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:18.028]  The original count, not something later down the road, needs to be something that's done in public or that the public can authenticate without need for special expertise.
[00:57:18.028 --> 00:57:18.688]  That's one thing.
[00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.629]  The next thing is, who voted?
[00:57:20.629 --> 00:57:25.491]  This is getting to be the next area, the next frontier where they're keeping it secret.
[00:57:25.491 --> 00:57:30.154]  It's getting harder and harder to see the poll books or even have poll books.
[00:57:30.154 --> 00:57:35.216]  They're starting to transfer these into electronic databases, which now you see it, now you don't.
[00:57:35.216 --> 00:57:43.300]  In Tennessee, I found 3,200 more votes than voters in the participating voters list.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.862]  What did the Chairman of the Election Commission say about this?
[00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:48.503]  He said, well, there's always going to be more votes than voters.
[00:57:50.013 --> 00:57:52.375]  Huh?
[00:57:52.375 --> 00:57:57.819]  So, you know, what needs to be public and remain public, it's always been public, is the ball book.
[00:57:57.819 --> 00:57:58.479]  Who voted?
[00:57:58.479 --> 00:58:05.745]  That's that, you know, who can vote, who did vote, was the ballot counted the same one as was passed, and is the count public?
[00:58:05.745 --> 00:58:09.748]  But how about also just politically moving to have these machines completely removed?
[00:58:10.745 --> 00:58:15.466]  Well, that helps with the counting phase of it, but remember, there's four phases.
[00:58:15.466 --> 00:58:26.570]  So yes, getting them completely removed, as Germany did, and just going back to hand counting in public, which by the way, is quick, and it is less expensive than vaccines.
[00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:27.350]  Bev, Bev, Bev.
[00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:28.350]  That's a solution.
[00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:29.431]  Bev, we've got to go to break.
[00:58:29.431 --> 00:58:30.011]  One minute break.
[00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:34.092]  I know you've got to go, but I want you to be able to finish up on this, so we'll be back in one minute.
[00:58:34.092 --> 00:58:39.834]  Do about three, four minutes with us, and you'll also be popping in on Thursday or Friday, or maybe both, once we know what's happened.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:45.361]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.361 --> 00:58:50.663]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.663 --> 00:58:54.244]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.244 --> 00:58:55.545]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:55.545 --> 00:58:59.946]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:58:59.946 --> 00:59:05.888]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:05.888 --> 00:59:08.029]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:10.710]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:17.556]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[00:59:19.778 --> 00:59:25.122]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:25.122 --> 00:59:30.407]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.

[00:59:42.754 --> 00:59:43.695]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:43.695 --> 00:59:45.376]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:06.452]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.452 --> 01:00:08.214]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.214 --> 01:00:09.975]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:11.577]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.577 --> 01:00:13.118]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.118 --> 01:00:17.302]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.302 --> 01:00:21.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.631 --> 01:00:29.743]  Well, we have undoubtedly the leading election fraud expert, also voter fraud expert, Beth Harris.
[01:00:29.743 --> 01:00:36.814]  She'll be joining us Thursday or Friday, perhaps both days, as we get a clear image of the election fraud clearly going on from Nevada.
[01:00:37.978 --> 01:00:39.959]  To Florida.
[01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:44.740]  She's in Kentucky where there's massive evidence of manipulation going on.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.740]  She hopes she can leave tomorrow and go to other states.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:56.143]  She hopes that the fraud isn't as big a tidal wave as it looks like it may be against the anti-establishment candidate Rand Paul.
[01:00:56.143 --> 01:01:03.905]  The website's blackboxvoting.org and of course the documentary film Black Box Voting as well preeminent on that subject.
[01:01:03.905 --> 01:01:05.866]  Okay in three or four minutes we've got left.
[01:01:05.866 --> 01:01:06.786]  You were going over the four
[01:01:07.746 --> 01:01:16.089]  levels of custody and the fact that Germany and others have just gone right to banning this outright because it's clearly just built for fraud.
[01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:17.930]  Please continue.
[01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:18.590]  Right.
[01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:21.511]  Well, you know, the first thing again is who can vote?
[01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.331]  The voter list.
[01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:27.573]  That gets played with now because what they've done is they've consolidated it into a statewide database.
[01:01:27.573 --> 01:01:34.516]  It's not hard for database folks to look at that and parse through it and so that is something that's really worth doing because it shouldn't be changing.
[01:01:35.436 --> 01:01:39.040]  Especially right in the middle of the election, sometimes it does.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.924]  The second one being who did vote, that's crucial, it's becoming more crucial.
[01:01:42.924 --> 01:01:53.415]  As we start to clamp down on controls over what's going on with the machines, we start seeing them playing with these lists of who voted and people are added in after the fact, electronically, or deleted out.
[01:01:54.777 --> 01:02:00.421]  That, by the way, that who did vote is so important with the absentee vote locations.
[01:02:00.421 --> 01:02:05.324]  We now have 25 states with unlimited absentee voting.
[01:02:05.324 --> 01:02:11.389]  Those kinds of locations rapidly rise to about 60% of all votes cast by absentee ballots.
[01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:17.694]  The key with absentee voting is you don't know who actually put that ballot in the envelope, whether it was an insider or an outsider.
[01:02:18.274 --> 01:02:21.915]  So, that who did vote is going to become more and more crucial.
[01:02:21.915 --> 01:02:29.717]  Whether the chain of custody, whether the vote that was cast is the same as the one that was counted, that is the now you see it, now you don't.
[01:02:29.717 --> 01:02:32.858]  They come up with all kinds of gobbledygook about seals and this and that.
[01:02:32.858 --> 01:02:36.979]  Most of it really doesn't hold water when you have to become sort of good at it.
[01:02:36.979 --> 01:02:45.081]  You know, the person, my cousin Vinnie person, who can see the magician stick it under the table, that's what you need for the chain of custody exam.
[01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:47.342]  Because a lot of that is really just smoke and mirrors.
[01:02:48.023 --> 01:02:54.273]  And then going to the actual counting of the vote, that's where we get into banning the machines.
[01:02:54.273 --> 01:02:57.118]  You cannot see anything that's happening inside a machine.
[01:02:57.118 --> 01:03:00.804]  You can be the best computer scientist in the world, but you cannot see an electron.
[01:03:01.673 --> 01:03:17.829]  So, we need to be able to have a public counting of the vote, which does not require expertise, and which is the original count, not something that happens weeks later, because you cannot really control chain of custody on something weeks later.
[01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:32.981]  Now you told me off air, you said you hope you can get out of Kentucky and go cover other post-election scams, but you're saying that there is a lot of evidence of chicanery going on?
[01:03:34.176 --> 01:03:41.202]  Well, I'm concerned because in 2006, Kentucky began to consolidate everything toward this one private vendor.
[01:03:41.202 --> 01:03:44.124]  It just does Kentucky, and I'm concerned about that.
[01:03:44.124 --> 01:03:48.187]  And it also sends its results to another private vendor out of Florida.
[01:03:48.187 --> 01:03:56.874]  So they have a private vendor handle the front end, and then they have another private vendor who tell you who the results are for.
[01:03:56.874 --> 01:04:01.078]  What they have going for them here in Kentucky, though, is a big lead, and it becomes
[01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:08.267]  Difficult to plausibly tamper an election when the candidates are headed by double digits.
[01:04:08.267 --> 01:04:12.653]  So I do hope that I can, you know, leave Kentucky and go to another hotspot.
[01:04:12.653 --> 01:04:13.775]  I'm sure there will be many.
[01:04:13.775 --> 01:04:16.379]  I'm going to have a lot of choices on my plate.
[01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:22.444]  All right, Bev Harris, we'll talk to you on Thursday or Friday or perhaps both days as things break.
[01:04:22.444 --> 01:04:27.948]  And even if you've got time, you know, for a five-minute update, you've got our contact.
[01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:34.112]  Pop in if you're on the road or, you know, being harassed or whatever and need some media coverage.
[01:04:34.112 --> 01:04:35.193]  We're here for you.
[01:04:35.193 --> 01:04:37.774]  We really appreciate your courage and your tireless efforts.
[01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:39.415]  Bev Harris of blackboxvoting.org.
[01:04:39.415 --> 01:04:39.876]  God bless you.
[01:04:40.649 --> 01:04:41.709]  Thank you.
[01:04:41.709 --> 01:04:43.750]  Alright, we'll talk to her coming up later in the week.
[01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:49.813]  We've got the head of Alipac coming on with all the illegal alien voter fraud going on, the Democrats predominantly.
[01:04:49.813 --> 01:04:52.214]  Your phone calls are coming up and a lot of other news.
[01:04:52.214 --> 01:04:53.074]  The phones are open 1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:53.074 --> 01:04:53.214]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:53.214 --> 01:04:53.534]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.794 --> 01:05:07.440]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.584]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.584 --> 01:05:21.312]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.312 --> 01:05:25.396]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:25.396 --> 01:05:27.357]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:34.391]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:39.452]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:05:39.452 --> 01:05:41.613]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:41.613 --> 01:05:43.393]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:52.375]  Thank you!
[01:08:01.795 --> 01:08:08.423]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.423 --> 01:08:16.592]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:19.836]  Look at this little piece of news.
[01:08:19.836 --> 01:08:20.317]  Out of NDTV.
[01:08:23.777 --> 01:08:39.086]  $200 million will be spent on security per day for President Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama's visit to the city of Mumbai, where our own government two years ago staged the terror attacks.
[01:08:39.086 --> 01:08:42.188]  It's even come out that the CIA minion ran the operation.
[01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:46.749]  About 3,000 people, including Secret Service agents, U.S.
[01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:52.733]  government officials, and journalists will accompany the President, several officials, not servants.
[01:08:53.971 --> 01:08:55.251]  from the White House and U.S.
[01:08:55.251 --> 01:09:04.174]  agencies are already there for the past week with helicopters and ship and high-end security instruments.
[01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:06.215]  So isn't that just special?
[01:09:06.215 --> 01:09:08.996]  I want to get into the economy coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:08.996 --> 01:09:11.817]  Huge developments ahead of the big Fed announcement.
[01:09:11.817 --> 01:09:19.179]  They've already leaked the fact to Bloomberg and others that they're going to at least have quantitative easing of $500 billion.
[01:09:19.179 --> 01:09:20.860]  That's the Federal Reserve buying
[01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:22.986]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:53.857]  Got a big stack of all the latest election developments we're going to be covering, but I want to go to your phone calls first on whatever issue it is you're raising at 800-259-9231, but please have your comments or questions ready because I want to try to get to a lot of people.
[01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:56.898]  Derry, in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[01:09:56.898 --> 01:09:58.939]  Go ahead.
[01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:05.522]  Alex, I just want to call in and congratulate you on letting the people know the truth.
[01:10:06.765 --> 01:10:19.755]  For the amount of time you've done it, it took a while for it to spread into the Tea Party and to spread into the Republicans and some Democrats on many of the issues.
[01:10:19.755 --> 01:10:26.800]  And you have been one of the major reasons why this country has changed.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.524]  I talked to you about three months ago, and it was the first time I heard it.
[01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:51.350]  Three or four months back and I was astounded and I told you back then is when I heard it I knew it was the truth and the people have heard it and they know it's the truth also and we are just about ready to witness the greatest change
[01:10:52.088 --> 01:10:52.789]  Yes.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:19.447]  The Republicans have put Obama in, and that really will come up, that the establishment candidates, be they Republican or Democrat, are globalist, and we're going to repeal NAFTA and GATT.
[01:11:19.447 --> 01:11:21.109]  We're going to repeal all these gun laws.
[01:11:21.109 --> 01:11:22.369]  We're going to control our borders.
[01:11:22.369 --> 01:11:24.331]  We're going to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:30.455]  We can even elect Ron Paul to the presidency if we keep our eyes on the prize.
[01:11:30.455 --> 01:11:34.038]  We have the power, but it's just like a football team or a baseball team.
[01:11:34.878 --> 01:11:36.860]  That doesn't believe they can win.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.083]  It's kind of like the Cowboys, if you want to use a sports analogy.
[01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:44.108]  Many analysts, because I do follow this stuff a little bit because it's everywhere, you can't miss it.
[01:11:45.296 --> 01:11:51.701]  Say the Cowboys have one of the best lineups of raw talent in the NFL.
[01:11:51.701 --> 01:11:58.565]  They have a better lineup than the Patriots, but they can't ever win because they've got a bad attitude and think they're losers.
[01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:00.827]  And it's the same thing for the American people.
[01:12:00.827 --> 01:12:07.231]  As we start to have victories, especially at the state level, people are going to realize that we can take this country back.
[01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:14.537]  And now all the issues that were called kooky are now mainstream, and at least Republicans are having to pay lip service to it.
[01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:22.024]  That shows how far it's come, and they're not going to be able to reverse things now when they get into power and call us kooks.
[01:12:22.024 --> 01:12:23.366]  People are now awake.
[01:12:23.366 --> 01:12:27.230]  It doesn't mean they have all the facts, but they're awake so they can at least get the facts.
[01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:28.591]  But I want to just say one thing, Derry.
[01:12:29.753 --> 01:12:34.396]  I appreciate you trying to give me credit for a lot of the awakening that's happening.
[01:12:34.396 --> 01:12:41.680]  And even Newsweek, Time Magazine, New York Times have all called me the prophet of the Tea Party.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.382]  And they've called Ron Paul the progenitor of the Tea Party.
[01:12:44.382 --> 01:12:46.763]  Because if you actually study it, that's where it comes from.
[01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:48.784]  But it's not Alex Jones.
[01:12:48.784 --> 01:12:49.785]  It's my audience.
[01:12:50.385 --> 01:12:58.689]  Our AM and FM affiliates, the websites, my crew, the listeners, taking action, spreading the word, telling people about the show.
[01:12:58.689 --> 01:13:01.331]  That's undoubtedly how you found out about it, Derry.
[01:13:01.331 --> 01:13:05.213]  It was through an internet link or a phone call or a video somebody gave you.
[01:13:05.213 --> 01:13:05.593]  I don't know.
[01:13:05.593 --> 01:13:06.753]  You can tell us.
[01:13:06.753 --> 01:13:09.034]  So it's all part of that process.
[01:13:09.034 --> 01:13:11.616]  I was once dumb as dirt 17 years ago.
[01:13:12.236 --> 01:13:15.739]  Woke up, got involved 15 years ago, been on air 15 years.
[01:13:15.739 --> 01:13:21.983]  It's a process of reaching out to people with real issues and they're now ready to hear the truth.
[01:13:21.983 --> 01:13:27.607]  How did you get awakened to this broadcast and then get awakened to the New World Order, Derry?
[01:13:27.607 --> 01:13:34.552]  Well, before I go into that, I'd like to say, I'd like to use a sports analogy also.
[01:13:34.552 --> 01:13:41.197]  I take it, as you are the coach and we are the team, the hockey team,
[01:13:41.816 --> 01:13:45.017]  Against the Soviet Union was a miracle on ice.
[01:13:45.017 --> 01:13:49.657]  And we, you just kept telling us we could do it, we could do it, we could do it.
[01:13:49.657 --> 01:13:52.698]  And eventually, we started to believe.
[01:13:52.698 --> 01:13:56.178]  And once we believed, no one could stop us.
[01:13:56.178 --> 01:13:57.299]  And that's what you were.
[01:13:57.299 --> 01:14:01.299]  You were our coach, telling us, bringing these facts to our mind.
[01:14:01.299 --> 01:14:03.940]  And, you know, like you pulled on the state's rights.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.740]  And, you know, we were brainwashed.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.500]  You know, we're supposed to accept this, and we're supposed to accept this.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.021]  You know, our government knows best.
[01:14:10.021 --> 01:14:11.381]  And you were saying, who are they?
[01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:17.828]  And then it broke, you know, you start thinking about it in your mind and you're like, oh my gosh, Alex Wright!
[01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:18.869]  How about that?
[01:14:18.869 --> 01:14:27.053]  Well, listen, Darryl, I appreciate all your very informative comments, but specifically, how did you first hear about this radio show?
[01:14:27.053 --> 01:14:36.278]  Well, I was walking in the flea market, and some lady said, hey, have you ever heard of Alex Jones?
[01:14:36.278 --> 01:14:39.340]  And this was back four or five months ago, and I said, no.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.261]  And she goes, take this CD,
[01:14:42.054 --> 01:14:42.915]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:14:56.983 --> 01:14:58.144]  This guy is right.
[01:14:58.144 --> 01:14:59.064]  Who is this guy?
[01:14:59.064 --> 01:15:05.389]  And so then I went to the internet, and then I started looking at you and I... But see, Derry, Derry, Derry, now you should start a website.
[01:15:05.389 --> 01:15:08.030]  You should get a local radio show on weekends.
[01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:09.151]  You should make films.
[01:15:09.151 --> 01:15:14.835]  I appreciate your call, because that's what's unstoppable, is that lady giving you that DVD.
[01:15:14.835 --> 01:15:19.178]  Is you dim-tuning into the show, and now waking up others in your area.
[01:15:19.178 --> 01:15:21.459]  That's what the globalists can't beat.
[01:15:21.459 --> 01:15:22.340]  Great points, Derry.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.721]  Very exciting to hear that.
[01:15:23.721 --> 01:15:25.382]  Jonathan in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:15:26.567 --> 01:15:33.413]  Yes, Alex, I have two videos for you that you'd probably be interested in.
[01:15:33.413 --> 01:15:34.994]  It's on YouTube.
[01:15:34.994 --> 01:15:40.599]  One of them is TSA Supervisor Busted for Stealing from Travelers.
[01:15:41.576 --> 01:15:45.459]  And basically it talks about how a TSA supervisor was stealing from travelers.
[01:16:00.752 --> 01:16:02.453]  Who watches the Watchers?
[01:16:02.453 --> 01:16:03.914]  That's what tyranny is.
[01:16:03.914 --> 01:16:12.079]  When government isn't accountable, crooks all get in, they hire their buddies, and then you fall off the edge of the earth.
[01:16:12.079 --> 01:16:16.841]  Okay, so one of them is TSA supervisor caught stealing, what's the other one?
[01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:23.285]  The other one is Blackwater mercenary gets away with drunken murder.
[01:16:23.285 --> 01:16:25.927]  Drunken murder.
[01:16:25.927 --> 01:16:27.968]  So when he's drunk he kills, I think,
[01:16:29.096 --> 01:16:32.557]  I think I forgot that he was one of them.
[01:16:32.557 --> 01:16:49.144]  Well, Jonathan, we were getting these reports seven years ago after Iraq had been taken over that there were drunk mercenaries killing people, shooting up houses and cars for fun, using drugs, and now it's all in federal court and people are like, are good boys of Blackwater?
[01:16:49.144 --> 01:16:52.705]  You mean the good boys that have moved over to the Middle East and left the U.S.
[01:16:52.705 --> 01:16:54.066]  so they can't be extradited?
[01:16:55.046 --> 01:16:56.607]  This is what happens.
[01:16:56.607 --> 01:16:59.288]  And again, people just have to understand.
[01:16:59.288 --> 01:17:01.368]  We have a corrupt government.
[01:17:01.368 --> 01:17:05.850]  Any government that tries to hire mercenaries, they're doing that so they're not accountable.
[01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:07.431]  Go ahead.
[01:17:07.431 --> 01:17:13.873]  Also, I want to talk about you bringing that guy from Alipac to talk about illegal immigration.
[01:17:13.873 --> 01:17:18.755]  Let me tell you why people need to understand why
[01:17:20.706 --> 01:17:20.886]  Yes.
[01:17:51.179 --> 01:17:52.976]  Um, the use...
[01:17:53.933 --> 01:17:55.894]  Croats against the Hungarians.
[01:17:55.894 --> 01:17:58.395]  Yeah, yeah, let me break this down for you.
[01:17:58.395 --> 01:18:00.236]  And again, it's not Catholic bashing.
[01:18:00.236 --> 01:18:01.776]  It's just the truth.
[01:18:01.776 --> 01:18:06.799]  The European Union was officially established in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome.
[01:18:06.799 --> 01:18:12.061]  That's why three years ago they had the 50th anniversary in 2007 for the EU.
[01:18:12.061 --> 01:18:21.925]  They didn't tell the public until 99-2000, just like we officially had a North American Union in 2005, signed up at Baylor by Vicente Fox, George Bush, and Paul Martin of Canada.
[01:18:22.816 --> 01:18:23.376]  But it's true.
[01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:48.495]  And it is true that the Catholic Church, at the highest levels, is intimately involved.
[01:18:48.495 --> 01:18:52.398]  And look at the last Pope, always calling for new world order in all of this.
[01:18:52.398 --> 01:18:54.740]  And it is a fact.
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:58.422]  But, you know, that isn't saying Catholics individually are bad.
[01:18:58.422 --> 01:19:01.084]  I mean, it's just like Israel's involved in all sorts of corruption.
[01:19:01.084 --> 01:19:02.826]  That's not saying Jews themselves are bad.
[01:19:02.826 --> 01:19:07.609]  Or the British government's involved in all sorts of empire and, you know, corporate globalism.
[01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:10.591]  That doesn't mean British people are bad.
[01:19:10.591 --> 01:19:12.573]  The Chinese government's incredibly evil.
[01:19:12.813 --> 01:19:15.235]  Does that mean the average Chinese person is bad from China?
[01:19:15.235 --> 01:19:15.795]  No.
[01:19:15.795 --> 01:19:17.616]  They want freedom too.
[01:19:17.616 --> 01:19:32.146]  But absolutely, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and these French and Austrian and German princes ran Mexico and ran wars against the U.S.
[01:19:32.146 --> 01:19:34.908]  and that's what people don't understand.
[01:19:34.908 --> 01:19:40.632]  I want Mexico to have freedom but Mexico has been fully imploded and they want to implode the U.S.
[01:19:40.632 --> 01:19:42.213]  using Mexico as the detonator.
[01:19:43.053 --> 01:19:55.007]  Uh, and they teach Americans not to be nationalistic, but then the Ford Foundation finances Mexico to be hyper-nationalistic, and all Mexican school kids are taught the Southwest belongs to them.
[01:19:55.007 --> 01:19:57.970]  So, it's not compatible with this country.
[01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:58.671]  That's the problem.
[01:20:00.805 --> 01:20:04.886]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:04.886 --> 01:20:09.407]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.407 --> 01:20:15.548]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.548 --> 01:20:17.989]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:17.989 --> 01:20:23.950]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:27.492]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.492 --> 01:20:29.353]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.353 --> 01:20:31.554]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.554 --> 01:20:36.416]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:37.237]  Guaranteed.

[01:20:41.519 --> 01:20:49.561]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.

[01:20:50.441 --> 01:20:51.542]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:00.253 --> 01:21:05.217]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:05.217 --> 01:21:06.217]  What have we got?
[01:21:06.217 --> 01:21:08.659]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:21:08.659 --> 01:21:09.660]  A republic.
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.322]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:21:12.322 --> 01:21:14.584]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:21:14.584 --> 01:21:16.605]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.286]  So they think they own our land?
[01:21:18.286 --> 01:21:19.607]  They think they own our water?
[01:21:19.607 --> 01:21:20.228]  Children?
[01:21:20.228 --> 01:21:21.329]  Our education?
[01:21:21.329 --> 01:21:22.149]  Our money?
[01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:25.812]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:21:26.172 --> 01:21:31.159]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:21:31.159 --> 01:21:32.180]  We have the facts.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:33.342]  We have the Constitution.
[01:21:33.342 --> 01:21:34.243]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:34.243 --> 01:21:35.124]  We have common law.
[01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:37.648]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:37.648 --> 01:21:41.433]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:21:41.533 --> 01:21:46.477]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:21:46.477 --> 01:21:47.998]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:21:47.998 --> 01:21:49.078]  Don't tread on me.
[01:21:49.078 --> 01:21:55.943]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:00.376 --> 01:22:04.437]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:04.437 --> 01:22:10.319]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:10.319 --> 01:22:11.420]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:15.421]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:16.121 --> 01:22:29.931]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:29.931 --> 01:22:35.535]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:35.535 --> 01:22:41.439]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:22:51.193 --> 01:22:51.253]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.625 --> 01:23:03.010]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:06.915]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:10.641]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:24:03.683 --> 01:24:06.685]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:24:06.685 --> 01:24:09.867]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:09.867 --> 01:24:13.810]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:18.433]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:22.876]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:24:22.876 --> 01:24:25.277]  Okay, let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:30.601]  We're going to get into the economy and more calls in the next segment and what's happening with the elections.
[01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:33.491]  Let's talk to Jenny in New Mexico.
[01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:34.452]  Jenny, you're on the air.
[01:24:34.452 --> 01:24:35.892]  Go ahead.
[01:24:35.892 --> 01:24:37.693]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:37.693 --> 01:24:42.996]  I'm a fairly new subscriber and a long-time listener.
[01:24:42.996 --> 01:24:49.060]  I just want to tell you my experience today with voting about 20 miles south of Albuquerque.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:50.921]  Okay, tell us.
[01:24:50.921 --> 01:24:58.265]  Well, first of all, my polling place was on my voter registration card and I had to go several miles to find it.
[01:24:59.255 --> 01:25:07.219]  If I were having any trouble with needing public transportation or walking, it would have taken me hours.
[01:25:07.219 --> 01:25:18.706]  So they located it pretty far away from where I live, and when I got up there, there were no signs indicating that the elementary school where I was supposed to go was a polling place.
[01:25:18.706 --> 01:25:24.149]  So I knew, according to the voting card, that's where it was, pulled into this dark driveway,
[01:25:24.699 --> 01:25:30.542]  All the lights were out in the building and there were no signs, no arrows.
[01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:37.266]  Let me guess, Jenny, is this a more conservative or anti-globalist district?
[01:25:37.266 --> 01:25:40.347]  I would say it's democratic almost all the way.
[01:25:40.347 --> 01:25:40.647]  Really?
[01:25:40.647 --> 01:25:41.488]  So somebody hit it.
[01:25:42.588 --> 01:25:52.953]  Well anyway, so what I did is I parked in the empty parking lot and tried the doors and they were locked and then I went around to the south side of the building and there's the polling place.
[01:25:52.953 --> 01:25:54.654]  But it was completely out of sight of the road.
[01:25:54.654 --> 01:25:58.356]  But I bet all the Democratic insiders, I bet they got tipped off to where it was.
[01:25:58.356 --> 01:26:00.357]  Oh yeah, the parking lot had a lot of cars.
[01:26:00.357 --> 01:26:02.478]  So this is at 7am and I went in and uh...
[01:26:03.564 --> 01:26:09.907]  And I was disrequired to show my license, and here in New Mexico, licenses are given to illegal immigrants.
[01:26:09.907 --> 01:26:11.347]  Same thing in Arizona!
[01:26:11.347 --> 01:26:12.528]  Same thing in Arizona!
[01:26:12.528 --> 01:26:13.968]  Same thing in Texas!
[01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:22.072]  So the only idea I had to provide was my license, and tell them my address verbally, and verify that it was all current.
[01:26:22.072 --> 01:26:24.673]  So that was all I was required to vote.
[01:26:24.673 --> 01:26:31.896]  And then, I had examined the ballot ahead of time, but when I was looking at the ballot, I have to say that
[01:26:32.466 --> 01:26:39.272]  In the local elections, at least one-third of the choices had no Republican challenger.
[01:26:39.272 --> 01:26:51.483]  So about one-third of that ballot was... It's not to say that I'm a Republican, I'm an Independent, and I split... No, but we don't want one-party or even, you know, two-party, twin, you know, fake democracy.
[01:26:51.483 --> 01:26:52.744]  We want a Republic.
[01:26:52.744 --> 01:26:57.789]  And people should have run just to be able to inject real issues into the debate.
[01:26:58.928 --> 01:27:04.390]  Yeah, and so basically one-third of my ballot was useless.
[01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:10.433]  There was nobody to vote for at all, because there's only one incumbent and only one choice.
[01:27:10.433 --> 01:27:11.613]  Interesting report, Jenny.
[01:27:11.613 --> 01:27:12.653]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:12.653 --> 01:27:14.094]  Let's talk to Michael in Florida.
[01:27:14.094 --> 01:27:18.636]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:27:18.636 --> 01:27:20.596]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:27:20.596 --> 01:27:24.878]  Okay, he's out of the room, I guess.
[01:27:24.878 --> 01:27:26.719]  Joe in Tennessee, you're on the air, Joe.
[01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:34.395]  Hey Alex, you've been improving and I give you congratulations there.
[01:27:34.395 --> 01:27:47.584]  Just on the voting, the computers are here to stay and my idea for the computers is, or for the voting, is to track my vote like a UPS package.
[01:27:47.584 --> 01:27:49.205]  The system is there, it works.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:28:01.786]  And it could be private, you could opt into it or not, and then it could be private that you could log in and see what your vote was according to the voter number that you were given.
[01:28:01.786 --> 01:28:06.868]  It could be total anonymity and you could log in with that code and track your vote.
[01:28:06.868 --> 01:28:09.090]  That's a good idea.
[01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:09.830]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:14.933]  I've been trying to post that around here and there every time I hear about the voting machines.
[01:28:15.526 --> 01:28:22.629]  Yeah, it's just your receipt number that's tied to your vote, and then if anybody messes with it, you're going to be able to notice that.
[01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:24.190]  Yes.
[01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:25.550]  That's all I had for you today.
[01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.011]  Keep up the good work.
[01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:28.671]  All right, thank you, Michael, or Joe.
[01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:30.732]  That's a very interesting point, Joe.
[01:28:30.732 --> 01:28:31.713]  Josh in Illinois.
[01:28:31.713 --> 01:28:34.774]  Josh, you're on the air.
[01:28:34.774 --> 01:28:35.574]  Yeah, Alex?
[01:28:35.574 --> 01:28:37.355]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:37.355 --> 01:28:39.016]  Yeah, I was just calling.
[01:28:40.034 --> 01:28:47.736]  Just recently I got awoken about three months ago, a neighbor was coming over to me and was telling me about some of the stuff that was going on and was actually talking about the 9-11.
[01:28:47.736 --> 01:28:52.497]  I was one of the people that only thought that two towers, I didn't even know about the third tower.
[01:28:52.497 --> 01:28:57.698]  Oh yes, as people learn about seven, that's the big light bulb going off above the noggin.
[01:28:57.698 --> 01:28:58.658]  Oh yes, exactly.
[01:28:58.658 --> 01:29:05.199]  And then I started to look up stuff for myself and what I was beginning to find shook me to the core.
[01:29:05.199 --> 01:29:07.300]  And I started telling everybody that I
[01:29:07.964 --> 01:29:08.144]  Good.
[01:29:08.144 --> 01:29:09.085]  Give us your blog real quick.
[01:29:31.701 --> 01:29:32.281]  Josh?
[01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:36.063]  It's NobleBlogger at WordPress.com.
[01:29:36.063 --> 01:29:36.823]  Alright, good job.
[01:29:36.823 --> 01:29:37.964]  We gotta go to break.
[01:29:37.964 --> 01:29:48.168]  Another person taking action, having their voice being heard, so we can show the world we are the majority, we understand what's happening, and we're not buying the fraud and corruption anymore.
[01:29:48.168 --> 01:29:50.749]  It's the beginning of the end of the globalist.
[01:29:50.749 --> 01:29:52.130]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.130 --> 01:29:54.671]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.671 --> 01:29:57.352]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.435 --> 01:30:04.998]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.998 --> 01:30:05.899]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.899 --> 01:30:09.341]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.341 --> 01:30:10.202]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.202 --> 01:30:15.085]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.085 --> 01:30:15.826]  It's true.
[01:30:15.826 --> 01:30:20.709]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:21.529]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.529 --> 01:30:25.112]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.112 --> 01:30:29.035]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.035 --> 01:30:29.295]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.815 --> 01:30:32.578]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.578 --> 01:30:35.862]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.862 --> 01:30:41.389]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.235 --> 01:30:50.401]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:52.203]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.203 --> 01:30:54.466]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:54.466 --> 01:30:56.790]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:00.552 --> 01:31:04.135]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:04.135 --> 01:31:05.437]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:05.437 --> 01:31:09.841]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:09.841 --> 01:31:15.786]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:15.786 --> 01:31:17.928]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:17.928 --> 01:31:20.611]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:27.455]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:31:27.455 --> 01:31:29.656]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:31:29.656 --> 01:31:34.999]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:31:34.999 --> 01:31:40.281]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:45.664]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:31:45.664 --> 01:31:48.606]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:31:48.846 --> 01:31:51.852]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:51.852 --> 01:31:52.613]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:05.312]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.312 --> 01:32:09.254]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.254 --> 01:32:11.655]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.655 --> 01:32:17.339]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.339 --> 01:32:24.022]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.022 --> 01:32:29.966]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:29.966 --> 01:32:33.668]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.168 --> 01:32:38.450]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:44.391]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.391 --> 01:32:47.953]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.953 --> 01:32:49.933]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:49.933 --> 01:32:51.054]  It's here.
[01:32:51.054 --> 01:32:57.856]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:05.145 --> 01:33:14.572]  We've got a report up on PrisonPlanet.com Aspartame causes premature births.
[01:33:14.572 --> 01:33:24.779]  That's been known for more than 20 years, but
[01:33:32.557 --> 01:33:37.858]  Now there's a bunch of mainstream media reports on it, including major U.S.
[01:33:37.858 --> 01:33:44.319]  and British newspapers, like the Mail on Sunday and other publications.
[01:33:44.319 --> 01:33:53.160]  So that is good news that people are learning how deadly Diet Coke and other aspartame-filled food and drinks are.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:34:01.582]  And, you know, you can say what you want about this radio show, and we've got media matters attacking us and lying about us again today.
[01:34:04.414 --> 01:34:16.629]  In the final equation, we're effective at getting people to question the system and to get politically involved and to not trust politicians and mainstream media.
[01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:18.611]  And that's healthy.
[01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:20.813]  Any way you slice it, any way you look at it,
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:31.285]  The establishment always is trying to discredit us, always trying to claim we're liars, always trying to claim we're dissembling the truth, when it's not true.
[01:34:31.285 --> 01:34:32.646]  They are the liars.
[01:34:32.646 --> 01:34:35.147]  They have been caught lying over and over again.
[01:34:35.147 --> 01:34:40.731]  If I have time later, we just linked to a Climate Depot article.
[01:34:42.026 --> 01:35:02.292]  About Al Gore flying on private jets around the world, leaving his car idling outside of events for hours when he gives speeches, being a hypocrite, owning giant homes all over the country and the world that have these huge carbon footprints, and Media Matters, George Soros outfit.
[01:35:02.292 --> 01:35:07.354]  I've sat there with Media Matters reporters on the phone with me, telling me that George Soros doesn't fund them.
[01:35:08.476 --> 01:35:18.606]  And then I can pull up the federal filings online, where he gave the money to MoveOn.org, and then they gave him the money.
[01:35:18.606 --> 01:35:23.351]  Same thing.
[01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:31.559]  And they try to imply that, oh, Al Gore says he didn't have his car idling, and Al Gore says he flew commercial, not private.
[01:35:32.543 --> 01:35:39.245]  When it was local media that saw his car idling, and when most of the time he does fly private, it doesn't even matter.
[01:35:39.245 --> 01:35:59.711]  The issue is Prince Charles, with dozens and dozens of homes, scores of aircraft, a private train, tells people in the news that you shouldn't be able to take a hot bath, because it's bad for the environment, and that you shouldn't be allowed to own a car, and that you shouldn't be allowed to have more than one child.
[01:35:59.711 --> 01:36:01.432]  He's on record lecturing us!
[01:36:04.099 --> 01:36:16.122]  And then these guys, depending on which actuary you look at, use hundreds of times the carbon that the average person does.
[01:36:16.122 --> 01:36:19.163]  That's the issue.
[01:36:19.163 --> 01:36:26.785]  And they have this bizarre headline about Alex Jones launders story, launders false story about Al Gore.
[01:36:26.785 --> 01:36:28.305]  In fact, can you pull it up?
[01:36:28.305 --> 01:36:29.226]  I've got it here in my stack.
[01:36:29.226 --> 01:36:30.306]  I forget the exact headline.
[01:36:33.012 --> 01:36:38.516]  Alex Jones launders story?
[01:36:38.516 --> 01:36:41.119]  Like to make it sound dirty or something?
[01:36:41.119 --> 01:36:41.899]  Launders it?
[01:36:41.899 --> 01:36:49.645]  Because we posted part of a Climate Depot article and linked to it, that's now laundering?
[01:36:49.645 --> 01:36:52.247]  See, Media Matters is insulting their audience.
[01:36:52.247 --> 01:36:56.631]  They come out and say we're lying about this, when the people that wrote it are not.
[01:36:56.631 --> 01:36:57.612]  We've looked into the story.
[01:36:59.537 --> 01:37:09.963]  And then they imply we're laundering a story to cover up where it came from, when there's the link right there to Climate Depot, as if Climate Depot and Mark Moreno are dirty and bad.
[01:37:09.963 --> 01:37:13.385]  It's just pure deception!
[01:37:13.385 --> 01:37:22.011]  So that the few Democrats that are still asleep, who read that website, feel like they're getting the inside scoop on what's happening.
[01:37:22.011 --> 01:37:28.795]  And that's why the system, the establishment, the mainstream media, they aired another documentary attacking me Saturday night.
[01:37:29.864 --> 01:37:34.907]  I got calls about it and looked it up on the online TV guide and there it was.
[01:37:34.907 --> 01:37:42.591]  Another big hit piece on MSNBC against yours truly about how I'm going to cause violence and how dangerous I am.
[01:37:42.591 --> 01:37:44.973]  Why do you think we're being attacked so much?
[01:37:44.973 --> 01:37:49.195]  Because I get up on air and talk about Bisphenol A sterilizing people.
[01:37:49.195 --> 01:37:57.120]  I get up on air and read mainline scientific studies about aspartame causing miscarriages and low birth weights and cancer.
[01:37:58.396 --> 01:38:02.157]  I get up here on air and talk about sodium fluoride doing the same thing.
[01:38:02.157 --> 01:38:10.098]  I mean, you know, let's get past the mainstream media and the government's attempted demonization of Alex Jones and just ask yourself.
[01:38:10.098 --> 01:38:12.579]  I mean, did we tell you that they were going to devalue the currency?
[01:38:12.579 --> 01:38:13.679]  It's now happening.
[01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:19.620]  Did we tell you 11 years ago with Economist on the show that derivatives would destroy our economy?
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:26.261]  Have I been selling for 11 years George Humphrey's book on the subject, Common Sense?
[01:38:30.223 --> 01:38:47.108]  I mean, it's common sense to know that if they don't just have fractional reserve banking for every dollar they have on deposit they can loan out ten, but if they can loan out for every dollar they've got on deposit a million, are the bankers going to take over society?
[01:38:47.108 --> 01:38:48.168]  Yes.
[01:38:48.168 --> 01:38:53.070]  And then are they going to implode it once they own everything and then hold you hostage to bail them out?
[01:38:54.704 --> 01:38:55.524]  The answer is yes.
[01:38:55.524 --> 01:38:57.525]  I mean, this is not rocket science.
[01:38:57.525 --> 01:38:58.805]  I say that every hour.
[01:38:58.805 --> 01:39:01.586]  This ain't rocket science, okay?
[01:39:01.586 --> 01:39:11.128]  If a 21-year-old, that's when I really woke up, 21 years old, I'm 36 now, been on air since I was 21.
[01:39:11.128 --> 01:39:12.588]  That's amazing.
[01:39:12.588 --> 01:39:15.569]  So I guess I woke up when I was about 19, actually, a few years before.
[01:39:15.569 --> 01:39:24.231]  If I could figure all this out, the general public, doctors, lawyers, school teachers, auto mechanics, you can figure it out.
[01:39:26.308 --> 01:39:30.210]  But see, people choose to call it a conspiracy theory.
[01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:40.396]  Oh, if something's scary, if something has responsibility attached to it, it must not be true.
[01:39:40.396 --> 01:39:45.618]  That will ruin your society when you have that attitude.
[01:39:45.618 --> 01:39:51.441]  Letting a bunch of unelected, unaccountable private bankers run our monetary system for 97 years
[01:39:53.888 --> 01:40:02.676]  Has turned them into kings of the world who are now trying to bring us into the next level of bondage.
[01:40:02.676 --> 01:40:11.744]  And we're here at the precipice.
[01:40:11.744 --> 01:40:16.108]  And it's time for everyone to decide what they're going to do about it.
[01:40:16.108 --> 01:40:16.869]  And to not get
[01:40:17.967 --> 01:40:29.938]  Divided and conquered by the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Media Matters, Keith Olbermann, all of them trying to demonize anybody that doesn't want more banker bailouts.
[01:40:29.938 --> 01:40:32.801]  Demonizing anybody that doesn't want to devalue the dollar.
[01:40:32.801 --> 01:40:36.845]  Demonizing anybody that doesn't want to lose their Second Amendment, the bitter clingers.
[01:40:43.035 --> 01:40:47.137]  The only way the globalists can beat us is if they get us to fight with each other.
[01:40:47.137 --> 01:40:51.100]  And that's why they spend all their time attempting to do it.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.701]  But it's not going to work.
[01:40:53.701 --> 01:41:01.986]  Sure, they'll automatically get weak-minded people to engage in all their hundreds of different diversions, but there is a growing core of people
[01:41:03.117 --> 01:41:12.905]  Gotta be 10, 15% of the population that is intelligent, focused, and becoming highly informed, who are gonna go out and inform others, and liberty is unstoppable.
[01:41:12.905 --> 01:41:20.612]  We've exposed all their favorite tools of staged terror, of staged financial collapse, of staged fake environmental crises.
[01:41:20.612 --> 01:41:25.456]  We have exposed their problem-reaction-solution paradigm, and the globalists know it.
[01:41:25.456 --> 01:41:30.701]  Now, I wanna go back to your calls, into more of the election news, as it unfolds, as it develops,
[01:41:32.281 --> 01:41:38.708]  But I first want to briefly get into the economy that I was just foreshadowing a few minutes ago.
[01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:44.274]  I mean, look at these headlines here.
[01:41:44.274 --> 01:41:50.241]  We're talking about the end of the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[01:41:50.241 --> 01:41:53.164]  As the dollar begins to resemble the Mexican peso,
[01:41:57.106 --> 01:42:00.968]  Or the Zimbabwean currency.
[01:42:00.968 --> 01:42:15.217]  As we move in that direction, housing, gas, electrical, oil, education, food, it's all going to go up.
[01:42:15.217 --> 01:42:16.698]  That's a no-brainer.
[01:42:16.698 --> 01:42:18.559]  And now you hear food's going way up.
[01:42:19.574 --> 01:42:21.415]  Now you hear oils going way up.
[01:42:21.415 --> 01:42:23.796]  Now you hear gold and silver going way up.
[01:42:23.796 --> 01:42:29.938]  Silver all-time high again today, going past the 1980 record.
[01:42:29.938 --> 01:42:31.459]  Why is that happening?
[01:42:31.459 --> 01:42:43.404]  That's like if somebody takes a gun, shoots themselves in the head, and then people wonder why are his brains blown out all over the floor.
[01:42:43.404 --> 01:42:48.806]  As they kill the dollar, as this decision is being made to enrich and empower the bankers,
[01:42:51.124 --> 01:42:59.354]  As the decision is being made to do this, this is going to hurt every single person listening to this radio show.
[01:42:59.354 --> 01:43:00.335]  Unless you're a globalist.
[01:43:02.367 --> 01:43:07.571]  And they're having concerted devaluation all over the planet of every other major currency.
[01:43:07.571 --> 01:43:10.192]  This is the biggest transfer of wealth in history.
[01:43:10.192 --> 01:43:16.576]  The banker bailout, all the rest of the stuff we've seen in the last two years, that was only a prelude to what is now happening.
[01:43:16.576 --> 01:43:22.280]  And we've got to get out ahead of this now and say, look at what the bad guys are doing.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:23.801]  This is how they did it.
[01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:30.866]  So we can stop them from using the crisis to openly set up their world government that we will then pay our taxes to.
[01:43:32.125 --> 01:43:39.867]  This is private global government run by the swindlers in the open.
[01:43:39.867 --> 01:43:42.568]  Fed poised for biggest decision in decades.
[01:43:42.568 --> 01:43:50.711]  This week's meeting of the Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Committee will be one of the most important in decades as it prepares to launch a new round of quantitative easing.
[01:43:50.711 --> 01:43:53.172]  An expanded round of money printing.
[01:43:53.172 --> 01:43:54.292]  But they don't give it to you.
[01:43:54.292 --> 01:43:55.312]  The spigot doesn't flow to you.
[01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:56.913]  It's bad enough to print money and give it to people.
[01:43:59.708 --> 01:44:06.624]  They're hoarding it and using it to buy things up with it as they devalue it and you and I have got to pay it back in taxes.
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:24.206]  They devalue the currency, they get our money to buy everything up as they kill the currency and then they move it to the new global currency for the next phase in the Ponzi scheme and then we've got to pay off these tens of trillions to them and pay them taxes to back the new currency.
[01:44:24.206 --> 01:44:28.988]  They're getting us coming and going and up one side and down the other at every angle.
[01:44:28.988 --> 01:44:30.609]  It's so insane!
[01:44:31.309 --> 01:44:47.724]  And if you can figure out what a slide ball or a speed ball is, if you can figure out what the eye formation is, if you can figure out all this stupid sports stuff that at the end of the day doesn't matter, you've got a brain to figure out what's happening with banking.
[01:44:47.724 --> 01:44:49.045]  Okay?
[01:44:49.045 --> 01:44:51.367]  You're like, well, I'm not a fan of knowing how the world works.
[01:44:51.367 --> 01:44:53.108]  Well, you better become a fan of that.
[01:44:53.869 --> 01:45:04.296]  You better, instead of learning about all the baseball people and all the football people and what their statistics are, and I'm not talking to our general listeners, I'm talking to new listeners.
[01:45:04.296 --> 01:45:08.819]  You better make a decision.
[01:45:08.819 --> 01:45:10.460]  You wonder why we're in a depression?
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:11.821]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:45:11.821 --> 01:45:15.764]  You better get up off your fat rumps and do something about this.
[01:45:18.203 --> 01:45:19.043]  This week's meeting of the U.S.
[01:45:19.043 --> 01:45:24.566]  Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Committee will be one of the most important in decades as it prepares to launch a new round of quantitative easing.
[01:45:24.566 --> 01:45:28.208]  It will not be a saving the world on Sunday night occasion.
[01:45:28.208 --> 01:45:30.409]  Oh no, see, they're not going to save you right away.
[01:45:30.409 --> 01:45:32.150]  This is going to hurt.
[01:45:32.150 --> 01:45:37.693]  Occasion, like the meetings during the financial crisis, but only adds to the historic significance.
[01:45:37.693 --> 01:45:45.657]  The world's most important central bank is about to use quantitative easing as a routine instrument for monetary policy for the first time.
[01:45:45.657 --> 01:45:47.678]  And they're set to announce this in just the next few days.
[01:45:49.554 --> 01:45:59.480]  The case is likely to be derailed despite opposition from the FOMC who feel that the risk of QE2 are too great.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:11.067]  President of the Kansas City Fed, they're even having internal Fed fights over this, said that it's a loser policy that is dangerous gamble and is certain to vote against it.
[01:46:11.067 --> 01:46:15.629]  But those are non-voting members in the private Fed.
[01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:17.831]  It says Bernanke is set to carry the day.
[01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:22.924]  And to go towards devaluation of the currency.
[01:46:22.924 --> 01:46:25.506]  Now, here's the London Telegraph on it.
[01:46:25.506 --> 01:46:30.330]  QE2 risk currency wars and the end of dollar hegemony.
[01:46:30.330 --> 01:46:36.455]  You know, you notice this is all over the British and foreign news and Chinese news and the Chinese government saying, we better buy gold, it's over.
[01:46:44.673 --> 01:46:52.787]  But you read the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and it's headlines like, Inflation to Fix Debt!
[01:46:52.787 --> 01:46:55.452]  Oh, like they did in Mexico in the last 20 years?
[01:46:55.452 --> 01:46:57.115]  Oh yeah, that really helped Mexico, didn't it?
[01:47:01.206 --> 01:47:16.204]  The Fed's QE2 risk accelerating the demise of the dollar-based currency system, perhaps leading to an unstable tripod with a Euro, Yen, or hybrid gold standard, or a multi-metal Bancor, along lines possibly, said John Maynard Keynes in 1940s.
[01:47:16.204 --> 01:47:19.168]  That's how he described the end of the dollar system.
[01:47:20.342 --> 01:47:24.884]  China's Commerce Ministry fired an irate broadside against Washington on Monday.
[01:47:24.884 --> 01:47:26.404]  The continued and drastic U.S.
[01:47:26.404 --> 01:47:34.968]  dollar depreciation recently has led to countries including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand to intervene in the currency market, intensifying a currency war in the midterm.
[01:47:34.968 --> 01:47:35.628]  The U.S.
[01:47:35.628 --> 01:47:42.751]  dollar will continue to weaken, and gaming between major currencies will escalate, it said.
[01:47:42.751 --> 01:47:48.913]  The government, with the private Federal Reserve honchoing it, is slitting the throat of the country right now.
[01:47:52.244 --> 01:47:53.445]  Here's another one.
[01:47:53.445 --> 01:47:54.645]  Where does this lead?
[01:47:54.645 --> 01:47:57.487]  Christian Science Monitor.
[01:47:57.487 --> 01:48:11.295]  Now you know you try to talk to your yuppie neighbors, they'll still laugh at you because they were implanted over the last 30 years by little comments in sitcoms and dramas and movies and on the news that anybody that talks about a global government run by bankers is a kook!
[01:48:13.044 --> 01:48:17.165]  I had Lord Rothschild's air on three years ago, because he had a book out.
[01:48:17.165 --> 01:48:18.765]  We called the publisher and got him on.
[01:48:18.765 --> 01:48:20.526]  And I said, you're pushing a carbon tax.
[01:48:20.526 --> 01:48:21.526]  And he said, you're a kook.
[01:48:21.526 --> 01:48:22.266]  No, I'm not.
[01:48:22.266 --> 01:48:22.726]  Didn't matter.
[01:48:22.726 --> 01:48:25.007]  He was giving speeches every day, calling for it.
[01:48:25.007 --> 01:48:32.009]  To our audience, it was part of the disinfo disdain to just come on and say, no, we're not.
[01:48:32.009 --> 01:48:38.891]  So see, your neighbor can't resist this because they've been told it doesn't exist and they clutch to the con.
[01:48:38.891 --> 01:48:40.191]  That's how Ponzi schemes work.
[01:48:41.124 --> 01:48:52.231]  One of the most common is to go to a country club, this is what a lot of scammers do, and they'll get one old lady to invest with them, and they'll promise her in a month she'll get a 100% return on her $10,000.
[01:48:52.231 --> 01:48:55.312]  A month later, she gets $20,000.
[01:48:55.312 --> 01:49:00.475]  She tells her friends, four or five of them invest, they get a 100% return in a month.
[01:49:00.475 --> 01:49:04.578]  That's the original scam money they had from scamming somebody else down the road.
[01:49:07.796 --> 01:49:14.102]  Then, instead of 5 old ladies investing, now 300 old ladies invest.
[01:49:14.102 --> 01:49:24.993]  And in every case, when the guy skips town with 10 million dollars, by paying out maybe 100,000 of the rich old ladies in the first Ponzi scams, that's what the stock market is.
[01:49:26.462 --> 01:49:38.078]  When he skips town, the old ladies always, for several years in many cases, are still denying it and telling police what a nice young man he was.
[01:49:42.918 --> 01:49:47.001]  And it's the same with the banks and the government and Homeland Security.
[01:49:47.001 --> 01:49:49.863]  And you don't want to believe 9-11 was an inside job?
[01:49:49.863 --> 01:49:54.227]  You don't want to believe they've taken the death benefits of 6 million veterans and stole it on record?
[01:49:54.227 --> 01:50:00.311]  You don't want to believe the bank sold your mortgage many, many times over and scammed you?
[01:50:00.311 --> 01:50:03.273]  You don't want to admit the government would put sodium fluoride in your water?
[01:50:03.273 --> 01:50:05.055]  They'll shoot little kids up with syphilis!
[01:50:06.715 --> 01:50:13.739]  They'll shoot little kids up with live polio, of course they'll, of course they'll do, of course they, of course they did!
[01:50:13.739 --> 01:50:17.061]  What is it that you can't get through your head?
[01:50:17.061 --> 01:50:20.824]  But Media Matters says none of that's a problem.
[01:50:20.824 --> 01:50:22.345]  I'm saying don't trust the government.
[01:50:23.797 --> 01:50:28.518]  I'm saying get back to the Bill of Rights and Constitution, so I'm the bad man!
[01:50:28.518 --> 01:50:45.901]  And all these paid shills and feds, and their camp followers operating as patriots out there, who attack me through jealousy, through envy, through whatever, most of them are fed-controlled as well, because the globalists know how real we are, know how effective we are, and they're scared to death.
[01:50:45.901 --> 01:50:49.762]  Because if they don't complete what they've done, they're all going to prison.
[01:50:50.871 --> 01:50:52.792]  And that's what makes them so dangerous.
[01:50:52.792 --> 01:50:55.192]  They pass and point no return.
[01:50:55.192 --> 01:50:58.053]  When we come back, talk more about the economy on the other side, your phone calls.
[01:50:58.053 --> 01:51:00.534]  We've got another guest popping up in the last 30 minutes.
[01:51:00.534 --> 01:51:00.874]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.874 --> 01:51:02.094]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.094 --> 01:51:07.675]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.675 --> 01:51:12.697]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.697 --> 01:51:13.177]  It's true.
[01:51:13.177 --> 01:51:15.977]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:15.977 --> 01:51:17.738]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.278 --> 01:51:23.502]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:51:44.953 --> 01:51:48.394]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.394 --> 01:51:50.134]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:18.346 --> 01:54:20.107]  We're good to go.
[01:54:38.213 --> 01:54:51.666]  So, it is not an overstatement to say the United States has been in a long process of funding the empire, of being put into debt to the bankers, but now it is going to be imploded into a total third world cesspit.
[01:54:51.666 --> 01:54:54.029]  The taxes are all being raised.
[01:54:54.029 --> 01:54:57.192]  Government's taking control of every facet of our lives to make us dependent.
[01:54:58.206 --> 01:55:00.387]  We must say no to the global government.
[01:55:00.387 --> 01:55:02.388]  We must say no to the global currency.
[01:55:02.388 --> 01:55:04.749]  We must get involved now.
[01:55:04.749 --> 01:55:08.990]  And I'll tell you, it's time to support alternative media by spreading the word.
[01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:11.371]  It's time to support this radio show.
[01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:16.113]  It's time to get my films, which nine times out of ten are the vehicle waking up new listeners.
[01:55:17.512 --> 01:55:21.495]  It's time for individuals to protect themselves with silver and gold.
[01:55:21.495 --> 01:55:25.318]  Gold back up today, silver at all time, record highs.
[01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:30.582]  Ted Anderson, we've only got about three minutes left in this segment and I'm coming back with calls and election news.
[01:55:30.582 --> 01:55:41.350]  Give us your take on this open world government announcement, open announcement of dollar devaluation ahead of the Fed meeting and today's silver and gold offers that are the best smoking hot deals you can find anywhere.
[01:55:42.082 --> 01:55:46.543]  Well, Alex, I'm just going to say it real quick because the time is short.
[01:55:46.543 --> 01:56:01.807]  When you said that the kingdom was built by the Federal Reserve System and the banking community, they're kings sitting in our nation, which is supposed to be a nation formed around liberty and freedom, and they're the ones that are taken away from us.
[01:56:01.807 --> 01:56:04.567]  It's just a sad case to see that happen.
[01:56:04.567 --> 01:56:10.489]  I can just tell you right now, the offer that I'm offering right now is better than anything I've ever offered before.
[01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:17.253]  We are offering three silver dollars, the Obama deception, follow the Republican endgame.
[01:56:17.253 --> 01:56:23.657]  This is the perfect pack for getting started in precious metals for $87 postpaid delivered.
[01:56:23.657 --> 01:56:29.680]  I mean, you're getting three silver dollars, you're getting the best three Alex videos ever been out there.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:35.804]  Brand new, sealed videos so you can take the original copies and get these off to your friends.
[01:56:35.804 --> 01:56:38.386]  And at the same time, you get three silver dollars
[01:56:39.226 --> 01:56:42.147]  To start you out in the precious metals business.
[01:56:42.147 --> 01:56:45.048]  I just can't say there's a better thing for me to offer.
[01:56:45.048 --> 01:56:48.388]  We also have, obviously, the Frank, the British Sovereign.
[01:56:48.388 --> 01:56:49.929]  We have the Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:56:49.929 --> 01:56:51.469]  We got so many different things.
[01:56:51.469 --> 01:56:54.770]  You should just call us and find out what it is and what it's all about.
[01:56:54.770 --> 01:57:01.291]  But for $87 to pick up those three videos, three silver dollars, postpaid, delivered, $87.
[01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:03.452]  Alex, that's just the best way to get things started.
[01:57:03.612 --> 01:57:05.633]  Well, Ted, let's do the math.
[01:57:05.633 --> 01:57:12.175]  You told me off air yesterday you're paying about $26 a piece or more for silver dollars.
[01:57:12.175 --> 01:57:18.878]  So that silver dollars at $29 a piece is what people are getting them for.
[01:57:18.878 --> 01:57:20.118]  That's a great deal.
[01:57:20.118 --> 01:57:21.619]  Three silver dollars.
[01:57:21.619 --> 01:57:26.981]  And then they get three of my hottest, most informative films on top of it.
[01:57:26.981 --> 01:57:28.101]  That's a $60 value at $19.95 a piece.
[01:57:28.101 --> 01:57:28.822]  So that's $60 off.
[01:57:32.703 --> 01:57:40.473]  And so, three silver dollars, three of my hottest films, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:57:40.473 --> 01:57:44.978]  You basically get the three films free and get a great deal on silver dollars.
[01:57:44.978 --> 01:57:46.040]  Now, does that include shipping?
[01:57:46.516 --> 01:57:48.298]  Yes it does.
[01:57:48.298 --> 01:57:50.881]  $87 is also going to include the shipping to your door.
[01:57:50.881 --> 01:57:55.947]  And that would normally for three silver dollars and three films be conservatively about ten bucks in shipping.
[01:57:55.947 --> 01:58:01.994]  So you're talking about, let me see, $97 and then three films being $60.
[01:58:01.994 --> 01:58:04.256]  We're talking about a hundred
[01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:05.537]  Close to $150 value.
[01:58:05.537 --> 01:58:05.757]  $147 value.
[01:58:05.757 --> 01:58:06.637]  Am I math wrong?
[01:58:06.637 --> 01:58:08.118]  And then you've got free shipping and another $10.
[01:58:08.118 --> 01:58:09.318]  So you're talking over $150 value or $87.
[01:58:09.318 --> 01:58:11.198]  I didn't even know you were going to offer this deal yet.
[01:58:11.198 --> 01:58:12.799]  We just talked about it this morning.
[01:58:12.799 --> 01:58:12.859]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:12.859 --> 01:58:12.899]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:27.182 --> 01:58:28.263]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:28.263 --> 01:58:29.123]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.523 --> 01:58:56.486]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:56.486 --> 01:59:05.353]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:59:05.353 --> 01:59:09.976]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:20.805]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:59:21.425 --> 01:59:30.931]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:30.931 --> 01:59:36.374]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:59:36.374 --> 01:59:43.858]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:59:43.858 --> 01:59:46.600]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:55.921]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.921 --> 02:00:05.407]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.407 --> 02:00:06.728]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.728 --> 02:00:08.490]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.490 --> 02:00:10.251]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.251 --> 02:00:11.832]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.832 --> 02:00:13.393]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.393 --> 02:00:17.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.576 --> 02:00:21.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.268 --> 02:00:29.053]  We're going to your phone calls in the next segment and all the election news, and there's a lot of it.
[02:00:29.053 --> 02:00:34.117]  But Ted Anderson's our guest for another five minutes, owner of the Genesis Network, Midas Resources.
[02:00:34.117 --> 02:00:42.345]  He does occasionally loss leader deals, where he actually loses money just to introduce you to gold and silver, because he knows once you get silver in your hand and gold in your hand, you're going to want more.
[02:00:42.345 --> 02:00:44.626]  You'll realize the true value just instinctively.
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.182]  Not just looking at all the economic evidence with silver and gold.
[02:00:49.182 --> 02:00:50.542]  Silver right now in all-time highs.
[02:00:50.542 --> 02:00:52.403]  Gold back up again today.
[02:00:52.403 --> 02:00:58.286]  But I talked to Ted about offering three of my best-selling, hottest, what I think are most informative films.
[02:00:58.286 --> 02:01:00.567]  Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame.
[02:01:00.567 --> 02:01:02.147]  Even if you already have them.
[02:01:02.147 --> 02:01:07.830]  Get them for free for when you buy the three silver dollars and just give them to people for Christmas or for the holidays.
[02:01:08.630 --> 02:01:10.532]  Don't wait, give them early gifts.
[02:01:10.532 --> 02:01:15.938]  But I did the math, because I talked to Ted about doing a deal and he just went ahead and offered it out of the blue here.
[02:01:15.938 --> 02:01:19.062]  We just talked about this about two and a half hours ago.
[02:01:19.062 --> 02:01:23.767]  I did the math.
[02:01:23.767 --> 02:01:24.808]  Three silver dollars, $87.
[02:01:24.808 --> 02:01:26.210]  That's at $29 a piece.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.962]  And then you add the retail price of three films, $60.
[02:01:35.962 --> 02:01:39.665]  That's $147 value.
[02:01:39.665 --> 02:01:44.888]  And then he adds that there's free shipping that on average I know costs him about $10 for three silver dollars and three videos.
[02:01:44.888 --> 02:01:45.588]  That's conservative $10.
[02:01:45.588 --> 02:01:46.028]  $157 value for $87.
[02:01:52.162 --> 02:01:53.944]  That's like half off.
[02:01:53.944 --> 02:01:59.530]  In fact, guys, if you divide 87 into 156, doesn't that come up to just about half off?
[02:01:59.530 --> 02:02:02.734]  That is the best deal, as Ted said, he's ever offered.
[02:02:02.734 --> 02:02:04.936]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:04.936 --> 02:02:10.883]  I can't say it really supports the network or the radio show when Ted's losing money on it, but he is a free market guy.
[02:02:11.804 --> 02:02:18.168]  That's why in the last 30 years he's grown to be one of the biggest and most respected AAA rated Better Business Bureau gold and silver dealers.
[02:02:18.168 --> 02:02:20.829]  There's almost no other gold dealer out there that has a AAA rating.
[02:02:20.829 --> 02:02:22.330]  Ted is awesome.
[02:02:22.330 --> 02:02:23.811]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:23.811 --> 02:02:29.214]  That's even better than that silver dollar free creature from Jekyll Island deal that you're still offering.
[02:02:29.214 --> 02:02:30.394]  That's excellent as well at 800-686-2237.
[02:02:30.394 --> 02:02:40.440]  But in the last two and a half minutes we have left in this segment, Ted, what are some of the other smoking hot deals on silver dollars, silver half dollars, and gold coins that you've got?
[02:02:40.885 --> 02:02:47.533]  Well, I can tell you, Alex, I mean, we're looking at $25 silver and I still have the Walking Liberty half at $11.77.
[02:02:47.533 --> 02:02:49.936]  People can't, you can't beat that deal.
[02:02:49.936 --> 02:02:53.641]  I mean, that's so great, it's just not even funny.
[02:02:53.641 --> 02:02:55.683]  I'm giving away the Frank and the Forecaster.
[02:02:55.683 --> 02:02:56.645]  I mean, that's $159 for the subscription.
[02:02:58.607 --> 02:03:00.088]  I mean, there's just a lot of different things.
[02:03:00.088 --> 02:03:02.089]  I mean, British sovereigns right now are $3.74.
[02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:04.531]  You know, U.S.
[02:03:04.531 --> 02:03:11.875]  Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, Bars of Gold, PAMF Suisse, you know, there's just a whole long variety of things.
[02:03:11.875 --> 02:03:17.859]  If you like the junk summer, we have those in bags, $1,000 face value, or you can divide it into fractions.
[02:03:17.859 --> 02:03:19.620]  But, honestly, Alex, I mean, come on.
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:36.486]  If people get the real silver dollar that was used back at the turn of the centuries, which is what I'm offering, you will have a real silver dollar in hand that used to represent one dollar here in the United States, and you're lucky to get, you know, a candy bar for a dollar now anymore.
[02:03:36.486 --> 02:03:40.407]  I mean, that's how far down the road that we have gone.
[02:03:40.407 --> 02:03:49.070]  And describing the bankers as you had as kings in this nation of free people and liberty is supposed to be the standing foundation
[02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:50.030]  Well, they are kings.
[02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:51.511]  They're immune.
[02:03:51.511 --> 02:03:53.651]  Congress can't find out where the money goes.
[02:03:53.651 --> 02:03:55.952]  They are sovereign kings.
[02:03:55.952 --> 02:04:02.153]  That is exactly what, you know, we can't even audit their organization to see how badly they're cheating us.
[02:04:02.153 --> 02:04:03.834]  You know, that's how sad this is.
[02:04:03.834 --> 02:04:09.035]  I mean, one of our congressmen, Ron Paul, put together a, you know, audit the Fed bill.
[02:04:09.035 --> 02:04:15.596]  And it was passed in great support, yet the Federal Reserve System had enough power to put the kibosh on it.
[02:04:17.777 --> 02:04:20.259]  You know, that kind of stuff makes my blood boil.
[02:04:20.259 --> 02:04:24.143]  And that's why I think it's so important that people get the Obama deception endgame.
[02:04:24.143 --> 02:04:28.406]  I mean, this stuff describes it right to the T. And then you're getting these brand new videos.
[02:04:28.406 --> 02:04:30.048]  Who cares if you already have it?
[02:04:30.048 --> 02:04:31.249]  Pass it on to your friends.
[02:04:31.249 --> 02:04:32.590]  Let them wake up too.
[02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:33.891]  Absolutely.
[02:04:33.891 --> 02:04:35.012]  Resistance is victory.
[02:04:35.012 --> 02:04:35.512]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:35.512 --> 02:04:46.923]  An endgame made three years ago predicted exactly how the banking collapse would come through the housing collapse directly from Bilderberg sources.
[02:04:46.923 --> 02:04:48.304]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:48.304 --> 02:04:54.510]  Three films free when you buy the three silver dollars at already a great price and free shipping.
[02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:54.650]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:54.650 --> 02:04:56.151]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[02:04:56.151 --> 02:04:57.152]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:05:01.835 --> 02:05:05.479]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:05.479 --> 02:05:09.103]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.103 --> 02:05:13.908]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:13.908 --> 02:05:20.295]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.295 --> 02:05:22.518]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.058 --> 02:05:23.358]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:23.358 --> 02:05:23.878]  Bernanke?
[02:05:23.878 --> 02:05:24.538]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:24.538 --> 02:05:25.819]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:25.819 --> 02:05:28.059]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:41.963 --> 02:05:44.104]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:05:44.104 --> 02:05:49.228]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:49.228 --> 02:05:58.354]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:00.387 --> 02:06:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:05.850]  Number 1.
[02:06:05.850 --> 02:06:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.273 --> 02:06:10.133]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.133 --> 02:06:15.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.036 --> 02:06:15.777]  It's true.
[02:06:15.777 --> 02:06:20.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.480]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:25.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.063 --> 02:06:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.965 --> 02:06:29.745]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.745 --> 02:06:32.506]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.506 --> 02:06:36.188]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:36.988]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.988 --> 02:06:41.130]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.130 --> 02:06:46.192]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:58.016 --> 02:07:04.518]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:07:04.518 --> 02:07:10.920]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:18.303]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:07:18.303 --> 02:07:23.164]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:07:27.026 --> 02:07:28.407]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:46.742]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:07:46.742 --> 02:07:59.069]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:07:59.069 --> 02:08:01.150]  Thank you.
[02:08:01.150 --> 02:08:03.911]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:06.693]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.566 --> 02:08:17.555]  Okay, I want to go to Luma, or Luna, Gabe, Brandon, Travis, Danny, and others here in just a moment.
[02:08:17.555 --> 02:08:20.319]  Some of the other big developments taking place.
[02:08:20.319 --> 02:08:26.387]  Of the 40 plus thousand documents released by WikiLeaks, says Russia is the next target.
[02:08:27.884 --> 02:08:30.145]  And that's in a lot of the documents.
[02:08:30.145 --> 02:08:37.147]  Say what you will about Julian Assange, founder of the whistleblowing website Wikileaks, but his work has shown him to be pretty fearless.
[02:08:37.147 --> 02:08:40.028]  After his site published the biggest cache of secret files in U.S.
[02:08:40.028 --> 02:08:46.310]  history on October 22nd, detailing some of the ugly truths about the Iraq War, he continued to travel around Europe despite U.S.
[02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:47.490]  reprimands and warnings.
[02:08:47.490 --> 02:08:52.112]  He even told the global media that new leaks would expose more secrets, not only about U.S.
[02:08:52.112 --> 02:08:55.013]  military, but about other repressive regimes such as Russia and China.
[02:08:56.325 --> 02:09:01.951]  The signals coming from Moscow, however, suggest that Russian reaction will not be reserved as America's.
[02:09:01.951 --> 02:09:07.756]  So is WikiLeaks ready to take on the world's more callous states?
[02:09:07.756 --> 02:09:13.102]  And see, that's why a lot of insiders like Wayne Madsen think this is staged, because
[02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:25.333]  So much of what WikiLeaks puts out basically helps the Pentagon and puts out their official story about Pakistan, Russia, you name it.
[02:09:25.333 --> 02:09:30.355]  And we know that the Pentagon's wanting to make Russia and China the old Cold War enemies again when they own most of our debt.
[02:09:30.355 --> 02:09:34.557]  I'm not saying Russia and China are good, but Russia owns almost none of our debt.
[02:09:34.557 --> 02:09:36.838]  It's China, but we're told they're our little buddies.
[02:09:38.516 --> 02:09:45.720]  In fact, don't let me forget, guys, I want to play that banned ad, the television commercial about the national debt that is being banned by major networks.
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:47.381]  I want to get to that.
[02:09:47.381 --> 02:09:50.002]  Here is some other really important news.
[02:09:50.002 --> 02:09:58.587]  With the false flag terror attack of the parcel bombs last Friday, and a locky, the CIA lackey running all of that, Reuters reports
[02:09:59.247 --> 02:10:02.390]  Embassies targeted in wave of Athens parcel bombs.
[02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:08.074]  They also tried to mail one to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French El Presidente, a few days ago.
[02:10:08.074 --> 02:10:18.722]  This is the usual communist suspects that we know in Greece and Italy and France have been publicly run by NATO as part of the NATO option Operation Gladio.
[02:10:18.722 --> 02:10:20.743]  The Italian president's been on record about that.
[02:10:21.644 --> 02:10:31.753]  Bombs exploded at the Swiss and Russian embassies in Athens on Tuesday as police found suspect packages at two other embassies in a wave of parcel bomb attacks in the Greek capital.
[02:10:31.753 --> 02:10:35.957]  That'll give the government the excuse to crack down on anybody protesting the banker takeover.
[02:10:35.957 --> 02:10:38.419]  Police linked the attacks to Greek leftist guerrillas.
[02:10:38.419 --> 02:10:44.785]  Small bomb and gas canister attacks have been frequent in Greece since 08, when the police killing of a teenager sparked the country's worst riots in decades.
[02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:49.302]  And so it goes on from there.
[02:10:49.302 --> 02:10:52.084]  Things are certainly, certainly heating up.
[02:10:52.084 --> 02:11:03.051]  All right, I'm gonna try to quickly go to as many of your calls as possible before I get back into more election news and this restricted, censored TV ad dealing with China being the majority owner of our debt.
[02:11:03.051 --> 02:11:07.754]  We also need TV ads about the Federal Reserve being the second owner teamed up with China.
[02:11:07.754 --> 02:11:10.797]  But let's talk, so we have enemies within, folks, not just without.
[02:11:10.797 --> 02:11:12.818]  Luna in Illinois, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:11:13.902 --> 02:11:14.923]  Hey Alex.
[02:11:14.923 --> 02:11:15.023]  Hi.
[02:11:15.023 --> 02:11:15.824]  I'm from Chicago.
[02:11:15.824 --> 02:11:17.145]  Welcome.
[02:11:17.145 --> 02:11:18.907]  I've got a couple things to talk to you about.
[02:11:18.907 --> 02:11:24.371]  Number one, we were the city that the fake terrorist packages were coming to.
[02:11:24.371 --> 02:11:31.338]  And today, they have the USA Today, Obama signs extension of Patriot Act.
[02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:34.493]  Oh, to keep us safe from the... Oh, yes.
[02:11:34.493 --> 02:11:35.554]  Well, let me tell you.
[02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:40.339]  These are the things, these are the sections that are, um, that are staying enforced.
[02:11:40.339 --> 02:11:41.200]  The sneak and peek.
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:47.407]  Authorize court-approved roving wiretaps that permit surveillance on multiple phones.
[02:11:47.407 --> 02:11:52.092]  Allow court-approved seizure of records and property in anti-terrorism operations.
[02:11:53.715 --> 02:12:00.559]  Yeah, that's all a whitewash.
[02:12:00.559 --> 02:12:03.761]  Luna, Luna, Luna, you're reading out of USA Today?
[02:12:03.761 --> 02:12:05.202]  That's all a whitewash.
[02:12:05.202 --> 02:12:10.064]  The Patriot Act is written for them to secretly break in your house or business, never let you know they were there.
[02:12:10.064 --> 02:12:18.329]  If you find out there's a gag order, it has section 801 states that all misdemeanors, or is it 802?
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:26.624]  Texanado 2 states that all misdemeanors are basically an act of terrorism and strips your Bill of Rights.
[02:12:26.624 --> 02:12:31.207]  They've had tens of thousands of cases where they use the Patriot Act and non-terror related cases.
[02:12:31.207 --> 02:12:38.311]  I just wanted to point out what you're reading is the standard script that they put out about the Patriot Act so it doesn't sound as bad as it really is.
[02:12:38.311 --> 02:12:38.631]  Go ahead.
[02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:39.352]  It really is.
[02:12:39.352 --> 02:12:40.392]  Sure, sure.
[02:12:40.392 --> 02:12:43.594]  But I'm just getting to the point that they're getting ready for something.
[02:12:43.594 --> 02:12:45.555]  Now let me just say this and I'll let you go.
[02:12:45.555 --> 02:12:46.356]  Rahm Emanuel
[02:12:47.493 --> 02:12:49.154]  And you can look it up on YouTube.
[02:12:49.154 --> 02:12:53.957]  He says, yeah, I'd like to be the mayor of Chicago, but Mayor Daley's been in for a long time.
[02:12:53.957 --> 02:12:54.938]  I don't think he's going anywhere.
[02:12:54.938 --> 02:12:56.039]  Boom!
[02:12:56.039 --> 02:12:57.320]  He's out of here.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.422]  He says last month, I'm out of here.
[02:13:00.422 --> 02:13:02.043]  Next year, go ahead.
[02:13:02.043 --> 02:13:05.965]  Rahm Emanuel has a very famous brother in Hollywood.
[02:13:05.965 --> 02:13:10.428]  Now, Silverstein, as we know, owned the Twin Towers, blah, blah, blah.
[02:13:10.428 --> 02:13:13.190]  He also owned the Sears Tower until recently.
[02:13:13.610 --> 02:13:13.930]  I think?
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:38.965]  Everybody needs to wake up and realize that Rahm Emanuel gave up his job as presidential advisor so that he could come to Chicago and be the inside guy, just like Giuliani was.
[02:13:38.965 --> 02:13:43.467]  Where did everything go from Giuliani's 9-11, uh, all the stuff?
[02:13:43.467 --> 02:13:45.508]  Moved to China, so that we could not
[02:13:46.985 --> 02:14:12.984]  Well, actually, Luna, the globalists like to brag, and I remember five years ago, a CFR commission said New York, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, and one other city, I forget, are the main targets, and they loved to later say, see, we told you, and I agree, there's been a lot of activity in and around Chicago, and I think you make a great point, and I had even forgotten
[02:14:13.524 --> 02:14:14.705]  We're doing the job that you do.
[02:14:14.705 --> 02:14:18.787]  Thank you so much for having me on the air today and it's real nice to have your
[02:14:42.628 --> 02:14:44.230]  You're independent out there.
[02:14:44.230 --> 02:14:47.294]  I think you're doing a great job for the people of this country.
[02:14:47.294 --> 02:14:48.776]  Keep up the great work.
[02:14:48.776 --> 02:14:54.124]  As an ethnic Catholic and a Yankee, I suppose, I agree.
[02:14:57.199 --> 02:15:05.225]  For the most part, with your analysis of the Catholic Church, there are just a couple of things that I do want to point out to you.
[02:15:05.225 --> 02:15:09.668]  I would be remiss in not at least introducing... Sure, sure, Gabe.
[02:15:09.668 --> 02:15:14.471]  I mean, I talked about the Catholic Church, I think, over an hour ago, because a caller brought it up.
[02:15:14.471 --> 02:15:17.374]  I was just saying that the Catholic Church in the U.S.
[02:15:17.374 --> 02:15:23.118]  is lobbying and promoting for open borders, and I'm not bashing the Catholic Church in and of itself.
[02:15:23.678 --> 02:15:31.163]  Clearly, a lot of the other big denominations of the World Council of Churches, you know, the local Methodist churches are, you know, promoting open borders as well.
[02:15:31.163 --> 02:15:34.324]  The globalists have gone in and taken control of all these institutions.
[02:15:34.324 --> 02:15:35.385]  Go ahead.
[02:15:35.385 --> 02:15:36.126]  Sure.
[02:15:36.126 --> 02:15:40.088]  There's one thing, definitely, that I would like to take a look at, though.
[02:15:40.088 --> 02:15:46.732]  It's a piece that was written by the then-Cardinal Ratzinger, which was in 2007.
[02:15:46.732 --> 02:15:49.874]  And the piece is called, If Europe Hates Itself, where
[02:15:50.444 --> 02:16:05.654]  Pope Benedict, then Cardinal Ratzinger, says that if the West allows it to be overrun by illegal immigrants, that it is actually a terrible thing for Western culture and for Western nations.
[02:16:05.654 --> 02:16:16.762]  So even at the highest level of the Catholic Church, there is an ongoing discussion about the effects of multiculturalism, and not everybody is just a stooge
[02:16:17.842 --> 02:16:33.211]  Sure, Gabe, and we know that the mainstream media, because there's pervert guilds operating in Congress, there's pervert guilds operating in the Boy Scouts, I mean, it's everywhere, wherever there's kids, there's pervert guilds in the CPS.
[02:16:33.211 --> 02:16:35.612]  Why does the media only cover the Catholic Church?
[02:16:35.612 --> 02:16:38.594]  They should cover the Catholic Church and the things it's covering up.
[02:16:38.594 --> 02:16:45.658]  They should also cover the pervert guilds everywhere else, so we know that there's fissures and subgroups competing
[02:16:46.118 --> 02:16:48.419]  Within the New World Order, I appreciate your call.
[02:16:48.419 --> 02:16:56.584]  You know, my whole issue is the Catholic Church has been promoting the European Union and has been promoting globalism.
[02:16:56.584 --> 02:16:58.305]  And I was just stating that fact.
[02:16:58.305 --> 02:17:05.749]  But there's all these groups that are obsessed with Catholics, they run it all, or Jews, they run it all, or what are the other groups?
[02:17:05.749 --> 02:17:08.450]  You know, Masons.
[02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:11.572]  But when you study it, it's just corrupt groups
[02:17:12.492 --> 02:17:15.093]  Are in control of basically everything.
[02:17:15.093 --> 02:17:21.114]  And so by only saying it's one group that's doing everything, we can never beat corruption.
[02:17:21.114 --> 02:17:33.057]  If we reinstate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, if we reinstate states' rights, if we reinstate property rights and cut taxes, that cuts off the blood supply to all these groups.
[02:17:33.057 --> 02:17:33.197]  See?
[02:17:34.622 --> 02:17:36.322]  So I know what I want.
[02:17:36.322 --> 02:17:37.723]  It's liberty and freedom.
[02:17:37.723 --> 02:17:40.283]  And I know all these groups are promoting the opposite.
[02:17:40.283 --> 02:17:48.906]  And so instead of just everybody Balkanized into what camp they are, of which group they hate, I don't care who's running it.
[02:17:48.906 --> 02:17:50.846]  I'm exposing it.
[02:17:50.846 --> 02:17:58.668]  If a country stages terror, whether it's Russia or Israel or the United States or England or Italy, we cover it.
[02:18:01.212 --> 02:18:02.613]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:18:02.613 --> 02:18:03.514]  It's real simple.
[02:18:03.514 --> 02:18:06.376]  We just cover the info, you make your own decision.
[02:18:06.376 --> 02:18:09.518]  Brandon in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:18:09.518 --> 02:18:10.459]  Hey, Alex.
[02:18:10.459 --> 02:18:10.839]  Hey, buddy.
[02:18:10.839 --> 02:18:14.542]  It's a pleasure to be on your show, first and foremost.
[02:18:14.542 --> 02:18:20.287]  I had a bit of an issue here in Illinois with the voting.
[02:18:20.287 --> 02:18:29.133]  I've been following the elections really close lately, and I understand the severities that we're facing as American people.
[02:18:29.133 --> 02:18:29.834]  I am a Marine.
[02:18:30.613 --> 02:18:33.796]  Five years, eight months, and 23 days.
[02:18:33.796 --> 02:18:37.060]  So I've been there and I've done that.
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:52.976]  Well, I went down to my voter polling place today with my Illinois driver's license in hand and couldn't figure out why they would not let me vote locally, being that I had registered two or three times.
[02:18:53.888 --> 02:18:56.890]  When I came back from the Marine Corps, I was registered at my parents' house.
[02:19:23.848 --> 02:19:25.070]  Yes!
[02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:30.218]  What kills me, Alex, is the fact that they let me vote federally but not locally.
[02:19:32.554 --> 02:19:32.914]  You know what?
[02:19:32.914 --> 02:19:33.794]  Stay there.
[02:19:33.794 --> 02:19:39.795]  Explain to us what they did when we get back with Brandon, then Travis, Danny, Curtis, Ryan, and others.
[02:19:39.795 --> 02:19:43.976]  We've got the head of Alipac popping in, dealing with the illegal alien situation.
[02:19:43.976 --> 02:19:47.657]  Another ace card the globalists have.
[02:19:47.657 --> 02:19:54.398]  And, you know, you can just type into the search engine, federal court rules, illegals don't have to show proof of citizenship.
[02:19:54.398 --> 02:19:56.078]  Then you read the actual ruling.
[02:19:56.078 --> 02:19:58.139]  They're given driver's license in all these states.
[02:19:58.139 --> 02:19:59.059]  They get to vote.
[02:19:59.059 --> 02:19:59.659]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:00.669 --> 02:20:02.451]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[02:20:02.451 --> 02:20:03.792]  How would that make you feel?
[02:20:03.792 --> 02:20:05.513]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[02:20:05.513 --> 02:20:08.055]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:20:08.055 --> 02:20:15.621]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:20:15.621 --> 02:20:17.102]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:20:17.102 --> 02:20:19.865]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[02:20:19.865 --> 02:20:25.169]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:20:25.169 --> 02:20:30.193]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:20:30.333 --> 02:20:31.034]  We're good to go.
[02:21:04.392 --> 02:21:05.652]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:05.652 --> 02:21:09.594]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

[02:21:48.291 --> 02:21:50.272]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:50.272 --> 02:21:50.712]  It's here.

[02:24:23.251 --> 02:24:31.358]  Hey, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, we're going to throw this up on screen.
[02:24:31.358 --> 02:24:40.785]  One of Matt Ryan's friends just went to vote, and when they voted, they gave him a yo vote, or Spanish.
[02:24:40.785 --> 02:24:44.168]  Now again, you go to Mexico, they don't let you vote in English.
[02:24:44.168 --> 02:24:46.790]  You go to China, you gotta vote in Chinese.
[02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:50.413]  It's all about bringing people in and then not having them
[02:24:51.721 --> 02:24:52.923]  Become naturalized.
[02:24:52.923 --> 02:24:57.168]  It's about balkanizing everybody to keep them in their own little grips.
[02:24:57.168 --> 02:24:59.051]  So yo vote!
[02:24:59.051 --> 02:24:59.592]  Yo vote!
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:01.940]  Yo vote!
[02:25:23.322 --> 02:25:27.285]  Well, I was talking to the fellow in the military, uh, Brandon in Illinois, wasn't I?
[02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:28.786]  Brandon, finish up your story.
[02:25:28.786 --> 02:25:33.010]  So, you were allowed to vote federally in Illinois, but not for local candidates.
[02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:34.611]  Yeah, I couldn't understand it.
[02:25:34.611 --> 02:25:43.178]  Um, it was really odd, you know, and I'm in belief, uh, to eat the elephant, you gotta eat one piece at a time, so you start locally.
[02:25:43.178 --> 02:25:45.139]  And, uh, I couldn't figure it out.
[02:25:45.139 --> 02:25:50.303]  I went in there with my driver's license, my Floyd card, my, you know, IDs.
[02:25:50.303 --> 02:25:50.864]  I had them all.
[02:25:51.927 --> 02:26:02.914]  And, uh, I told them, you know, I had gone down to the DMV and registered three times, you know, uh, when I, when I turned, uh, 31, I had to go in and get a new driver's license.
[02:26:02.914 --> 02:26:05.335]  And, uh, they asked me then, do you want to register your bus?
[02:26:05.335 --> 02:26:07.236]  I said, yeah, without a doubt.
[02:26:07.236 --> 02:26:11.939]  You know, it's my birth given right, you know, as an American citizen.
[02:26:11.939 --> 02:26:17.182]  And, uh, so they, uh, you know, made me fill out the form, got the card.
[02:26:17.182 --> 02:26:19.683]  It's in the stack of papers in my office.
[02:26:19.683 --> 02:26:20.824]  I'm a small business owner.
[02:26:21.702 --> 02:26:28.447]  And I went in there and they directed me to the election office.
[02:26:28.447 --> 02:26:30.048]  But Brandon, see that's the problem.
[02:26:30.048 --> 02:26:34.510]  You're currently in the military, so that's one strike against you, and you're a small business owner.
[02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:36.712]  You are model Al Qaeda.
[02:26:36.712 --> 02:26:40.534]  According to Homeland Security, returning veterans are the number one enemy.
[02:26:40.534 --> 02:26:44.817]  So of course you're not allowed to vote locally as an Al Qaeda.
[02:26:44.817 --> 02:26:48.559]  Yeah, I'm not still in the military.
[02:26:48.559 --> 02:26:48.960]  I'm out.
[02:26:50.036 --> 02:26:54.130]  Oh, that's a returning veteran, then you are pure Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:54.130 --> 02:26:56.016]  You're the number one threat to America, sir.
[02:26:57.304 --> 02:27:00.968]  You know, that's so sad to hear because we're the backbone of the communities.
[02:27:00.968 --> 02:27:03.170]  We're the ones that keep this place going.
[02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:07.414]  You know, and... Not according to the government, not according to the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, Brandon.
[02:27:07.414 --> 02:27:08.976]  I mean, have you read those reports?
[02:27:08.976 --> 02:27:12.119]  I mean, I'm not... It sounds crazy or like I'm being sarcastic.
[02:27:12.119 --> 02:27:14.081]  No, I mean, you are pure evil.
[02:27:14.081 --> 02:27:21.108]  And I don't think you're evil, but... So you went into the election office to the little commissars, and what did the political commissaria tell you?
[02:27:22.577 --> 02:27:26.322]  Yeah, and they told me, they said, you can't register again.
[02:27:26.322 --> 02:27:30.246]  I said, why would I want to register again when I've already registered three times?
[02:27:30.246 --> 02:27:32.970]  I said, the fact of the matter is, is that I'm here to vote.
[02:27:32.970 --> 02:27:33.851]  If I did not
[02:27:34.364 --> 02:27:40.410]  I wouldn't have gotten the hundreds of calls from the senators and the judges and everybody else on my phone.
[02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:54.725]  Yeah, we see this all the time, where citizens with no criminal record aren't on the voting rolls, even though you try over and over again, and then you'll stand there right next to illegal aliens who have no ID, consular matricula, and they are just bowed down to.
[02:27:54.725 --> 02:27:56.186]  You're an illegal alien!
[02:27:56.186 --> 02:27:57.587]  Please, master, do whatever you need to!
[02:27:58.686 --> 02:28:05.051]  Because, again, the globalists want to drive down wages and bring in groups of people that have animosity to this country.
[02:28:05.051 --> 02:28:07.553]  Not all the immigrants, but large portions of them.
[02:28:07.553 --> 02:28:08.354]  That's the plan.
[02:28:08.354 --> 02:28:10.296]  Sorry to hear about that, Brandon.
[02:28:10.296 --> 02:28:11.657]  Let's talk to Travis in Florida.
[02:28:11.657 --> 02:28:14.899]  Travis, you're on the air.
[02:28:14.899 --> 02:28:15.920]  Yeah.
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:17.782]  Yes.
[02:28:17.782 --> 02:28:20.464]  Well, I have two things to say.
[02:28:20.464 --> 02:28:21.104]  Okay.
[02:28:21.104 --> 02:28:26.669]  Well, the first thing is, now, I don't know how many people are actually Christians, but, you know, the whole thing with the whole
[02:28:27.763 --> 02:28:28.584]  I don't
[02:28:44.125 --> 02:28:48.806]  If you're going by the Book of Revelation, then these are the things that actually have to play out.
[02:28:48.806 --> 02:28:59.729]  Well, according to Butch Reno on 60 Minutes and Butch Napolitano, according to these ladies, Christians who believe in the return of Christ are the number one threat.
[02:28:59.729 --> 02:29:00.949]  I mean, pull those quotes up.
[02:29:00.949 --> 02:29:04.050]  So, how dare you talk about Al-Qaeda on my show?
[02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:04.950]  Are you Al-Qaeda, sir?
[02:29:06.127 --> 02:29:07.568]  Are you as bad as that veteran?
[02:29:07.568 --> 02:29:08.529]  You're Al Qaeda.
[02:29:08.529 --> 02:29:12.792]  If you are a foreign banker stealing trillions, not telling Congress where the money is, you would be good.
[02:29:12.792 --> 02:29:14.012]  You are George Washington.
[02:29:14.012 --> 02:29:16.234]  If you're a Christian or a returning veteran, you are Al Qaeda.
[02:29:33.942 --> 02:29:35.163]  I appreciate your call.
[02:29:35.163 --> 02:29:39.067]  It's very scary to talk to actual Al-Qaeda members calling into the show, folks.
[02:29:39.067 --> 02:29:43.471]  These returning veterans, these Christians, people who believe in private property, they're scary.
[02:29:43.471 --> 02:29:47.955]  Okay, I mean, oh, oh, this Rand Paul might win today?
[02:29:47.955 --> 02:29:49.156]  Oh, I'm so afraid right now.
[02:29:49.156 --> 02:29:52.459]  I mean... We're on the march.
[02:29:52.459 --> 02:29:55.001]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.001 --> 02:29:57.683]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:04.323]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:04.323 --> 02:31:05.624]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:05.624 --> 02:31:10.028]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:10.028 --> 02:31:15.974]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:15.974 --> 02:31:18.115]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:18.115 --> 02:31:20.798]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:27.643]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[02:31:35.208 --> 02:31:40.472]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.

[02:32:00.588 --> 02:32:07.254]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:32:07.254 --> 02:32:12.398]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.398 --> 02:32:14.279]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:32:16.448 --> 02:32:37.274]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[02:33:10.059 --> 02:33:14.792]  In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:24.468 --> 02:33:29.751]  Well, in Arizona and Nevada and other states, the illegal aliens get to vote.
[02:33:29.751 --> 02:33:32.232]  That's federal courts, because they said so.
[02:33:32.232 --> 02:33:35.554]  But the veterans, most of them, they're having problems.
[02:33:35.554 --> 02:33:39.356]  The troops overseas didn't get their ballots, or they didn't make it back.
[02:33:39.356 --> 02:33:41.397]  Both things are happening, and that's just the way it is.
[02:33:41.397 --> 02:33:42.978]  But the government's good.
[02:33:42.978 --> 02:33:44.659]  It's all just an accident.
[02:33:44.659 --> 02:33:45.500]  Everything's wonderful.
[02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:51.263]  You know, the government knows you're upset about the foreign banks taking over the country and the end of the dollar and the Chinese owning
[02:33:52.310 --> 02:33:53.030]  Most of our debt.
[02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:56.953]  I'm going to play that TV ad for our guest here in just a moment.
[02:33:56.953 --> 02:34:08.399]  We're going to look at the illegal aliens and what they're up to with William Gein of Alipac, the real experts, the largest nonpartisan group trying to defend our borders and our sovereignty.
[02:34:08.399 --> 02:34:10.780]  We're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:14.022]  I wanted to tell you about a few of our great sponsors first.

[02:35:10.759 --> 02:35:12.220]  Be ready for emergency.
[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:17.002]  Food prices are skyrocketing as they predicted two years ago because of dollar devaluation.

[02:35:28.595 --> 02:35:31.457]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.

[02:35:48.252 --> 02:35:50.314]  That may be a bad thing for some people.
[02:35:50.314 --> 02:35:51.315]  Maybe you want to buy from China.
[02:35:51.755 --> 02:35:54.697]  You know, but purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:35:54.697 --> 02:35:58.841]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:35:58.841 --> 02:36:00.362]  They have a full line of household filters.
[02:36:00.362 --> 02:36:01.683]  They have whole house filters.
[02:36:01.683 --> 02:36:02.744]  You can remove fluoride.
[02:36:02.744 --> 02:36:06.687]  And they've got a full spectrum of filters for different types of things you want to remove.
[02:36:06.687 --> 02:36:07.828]  And it's all made in America.
[02:36:07.828 --> 02:36:10.149]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:36:10.149 --> 02:36:14.073]  Links up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:36:15.094 --> 02:36:15.895]  Okay.
[02:36:15.895 --> 02:36:19.137]  Again, I want to thank our great sponsors.
[02:36:19.137 --> 02:36:23.560]  We've got William Gein of Alipac on with us.
[02:36:25.035 --> 02:36:29.499]  And we've got different reports here from Alipac, alipac.us.
[02:36:29.499 --> 02:36:33.343]  National organization warns of illegal immigrant voters.
[02:36:33.343 --> 02:36:37.006]  And we've got serious situations, as I said, in many states.
[02:36:37.006 --> 02:36:42.432]  Another report here, four Americans killed in separate attacks in Border City, Mexican authorities say.
[02:36:42.432 --> 02:36:46.596]  We had the media tried to deny that woman's husband got killed in the jet ski down on Falcon Lake.
[02:36:47.356 --> 02:36:50.318]  Then they sent an investigator down there and he got his head chopped off.
[02:36:50.318 --> 02:36:56.782]  Then the controlled globalist fake liberal media tried to claim there weren't beheadings going on in Arizona.
[02:36:56.782 --> 02:36:58.923]  They tried to claim the governor was full of baloney.
[02:36:58.923 --> 02:37:04.406]  I've seen at least six different articles the last two weeks of beheadings going on, even in places like Phoenix.
[02:37:04.406 --> 02:37:06.867]  I mean, they're chopping the heads off left and right.
[02:37:06.867 --> 02:37:10.349]  It is quite an enjoyment for the Mexican drug cartels.
[02:37:10.349 --> 02:37:11.830]  The police turn and run.
[02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:16.373]  The Border Patrol announced three months ago they've been pulled in many states, like Arizona, ten miles off the border.
[02:37:16.953 --> 02:37:18.394]  80 plus miles into Arizona.
[02:37:18.394 --> 02:37:19.715]  There's now federal signs up.
[02:37:19.715 --> 02:37:20.856]  Don't drive down this highway.
[02:37:20.856 --> 02:37:22.437]  Don't go to this national park.
[02:37:22.437 --> 02:37:25.058]  The drug cartels are being given part of U.S.
[02:37:25.058 --> 02:37:25.659]  sovereignty.
[02:37:25.659 --> 02:37:28.700]  And all over the country, it's the default.
[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:36.105]  And one of Matt Riott's friends confirmed at a polling place that they went in to vote a few hours ago, and the default was yo vote.
[02:37:36.105 --> 02:37:37.726]  You only get it in Spanish.
[02:37:37.726 --> 02:37:44.450]  So not only are all the signs at most Bank of America's only in Spanish here in Austin, but now you don't get a choice.
[02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:45.271]  Yo vote.
[02:37:46.445 --> 02:37:48.767]  But again, in Mexico, you don't get a choice.
[02:37:48.767 --> 02:37:52.030]  You don't get to illegally vote down there, and it sure isn't in English.
[02:37:52.030 --> 02:38:01.439]  So here to briefly talk about this with us, we'll have him on in the next few days, again, in the aftermath of the illegal alien orgy of globalist treason going on.
[02:38:01.439 --> 02:38:05.843]  But William Gein is the leader of America's for Legal Immigration PAC, or ALIPAC.
[02:38:06.544 --> 02:38:08.946]  Hey, it's always a pleasure to be with you and your listeners, Alex.
[02:38:08.946 --> 02:38:11.047]  You and your folks are right on the money.
[02:38:22.196 --> 02:38:28.621]  Well, my friend, you've got your feelers and things out there with your members all over the country.
[02:38:28.621 --> 02:38:30.162]  It's also mainstream news.
[02:38:30.162 --> 02:38:33.125]  We're seeing the illegal aliens in a full court press.
[02:38:33.125 --> 02:38:35.927]  We've seen Obama broadcasting in Mexico.
[02:38:35.927 --> 02:38:39.650]  He's saying anybody who votes against open borders is an enemy.
[02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:41.671]  He's now backtracking on that today.
[02:38:41.671 --> 02:38:44.774]  But, I mean, we're seeing treason in high gear break down what's happening.
[02:38:45.387 --> 02:38:53.893]  Well, let me tell you, what I've been telling audiences across the country today is America's about to get our first Chicago-style national election.
[02:38:53.893 --> 02:38:57.916]  And I expect fraud to be rampant because the Democrats and other D.C.
[02:38:57.916 --> 02:39:00.618]  insiders are fearful.
[02:39:00.618 --> 02:39:03.320]  They want to limit this backlash.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:07.863]  They understand that the House can change Republican and things like that, but they're very worried about the
[02:39:08.483 --> 02:39:09.044]  We're good to go.
[02:39:26.605 --> 02:39:37.416]  Although we may just be twisting on the gallows at the last moments, but the American public is trying desperately to reclaim control of the government.
[02:39:37.416 --> 02:39:40.559]  And so they're out there and we're looking at some polling numbers and stuff.
[02:39:40.559 --> 02:39:43.762]  So the Democrats and the powers that be, they're like, okay, uh,
[02:39:44.517 --> 02:39:51.020]  Our women voters are out of here because of the women like Palin are running and Joy Behar has alienated women.
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:54.601]  The black population isn't really moving for us.
[02:39:54.601 --> 02:39:57.642]  The students are back to their student grind.
[02:39:57.642 --> 02:39:59.063]  So, you know, who can we motivate?
[02:39:59.063 --> 02:40:07.846]  So they've gone around the country telling everybody in their minority communities that they're fighting against the KKK and neo-Nazis today.
[02:40:09.116 --> 02:40:13.062]  And they've told the illegal aliens that their amnesty is in jeopardy because it is.
[02:40:13.062 --> 02:40:16.646]  And I think you really said something very important there.
[02:40:16.646 --> 02:40:24.096]  You know, John Boehner came out and criticized Obama yesterday for calling his opposition as, i.e., Republican.
[02:40:25.061 --> 02:40:26.142]  Enemies.
[02:40:26.142 --> 02:40:30.245]  And I think that Boehner tried to redirect a little bit there because Boehner didn't even mention immigration.
[02:40:30.245 --> 02:40:52.701]  I went on Fox News as their first guest this morning for the election day kickoff and I said, listen, Obama spoke, he didn't say your enemies to the Hispanic audience, he said our enemies in regards to all of the American opponents to comprehensive immigration reform amnesty, which of course is opposed by, if you know the real data, by 200 million Americans.
[02:40:53.362 --> 02:40:53.844]  I'm good.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:04.182]  And he's apologizing for that, but you know, that cat's out of the bag, Alex.
[02:41:04.182 --> 02:41:05.283]  I mean, wake up, America.
[02:41:05.283 --> 02:41:10.066]  The President of the United States just called millions of American citizens his enemies.
[02:41:10.066 --> 02:41:13.808]  If you don't get it, if you can't see it now, God help us all.
[02:41:32.201 --> 02:41:42.856]  Meanwhile, you've got MSNBC showing a few Republicans roughing people up or Tea Party people roughing folks up, ignoring the union thugs.
[02:41:42.856 --> 02:41:46.501]  It's got to be four or five to one in the videos I see beating up people.
[02:41:47.523 --> 02:41:53.108]  Illegal aliens from Arizona to California beating people up on the local news.
[02:41:53.108 --> 02:41:54.309]  That's all ignored.
[02:41:54.309 --> 02:42:02.797]  And MSNBC says if you oppose government health care, if you oppose open borders, if you oppose gun control, you are a Nazi.
[02:42:02.797 --> 02:42:04.939]  And then they always criticize anybody.
[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:12.124]  Who talks about, you know, the real issues, saying we're gonna invoke violence when they're trying to invoke violence themselves!
[02:42:12.124 --> 02:42:15.506]  I mean, this is a group of lawless thugs!
[02:42:15.506 --> 02:42:17.867]  They're using fighting words.
[02:42:17.867 --> 02:42:26.913]  Joy Behar's comment about Sharon Angle, if made from one person to another, face to face or in a room, would be considered in a court of law, fighting words.
[02:42:26.913 --> 02:42:31.836]  Calling someone KKK or Nazi to their face in the same room would be a fighting word.
[02:42:31.836 --> 02:42:33.377]  Calling somebody your enemy.
[02:42:33.917 --> 02:42:36.158]  And let's go punish our enemy.
[02:42:36.158 --> 02:42:38.479]  In the same room, these are fighting words.
[02:42:38.479 --> 02:42:51.745]  And the President of the United States, instead of being out there calming and soothing tensions, is escalating them with this belligerent, bellicose, and warlike talk against the American citizen.
[02:42:51.745 --> 02:42:57.268]  The illegal aliens he was addressing do not see us as their people, and we don't see them as our people.
[02:42:57.268 --> 02:42:58.328]  They're not American citizens.
[02:42:58.328 --> 02:42:59.709]  They're not supposed to be here.
[02:42:59.709 --> 02:43:00.309]  The President
[02:43:01.489 --> 02:43:14.234]  The United States, the Justice Department under Eric Holder, the Department of Homeland Security under Janet Napolitano, has shown a consistent and decisive pattern of siding with illegal aliens against Americans.
[02:43:14.234 --> 02:43:20.477]  And so today, I am convinced that illegal aliens will be voting against
[02:43:21.368 --> 02:43:21.488]  Yes.
[02:43:21.488 --> 02:43:21.568]  Yes.
[02:43:40.749 --> 02:43:45.792]  Uh, down in Atlanta, uh, they've found a way to locate the illegals and the non-citizens.
[02:43:45.792 --> 02:44:00.201]  So they have found, in a small sample they conducted, hundreds of non-citizens registered, hundreds of non-citizens voting, and this is in a state that tried, earlier this year, to screen its voter registration databases against federal databases for illegal aid.
[02:44:00.201 --> 02:44:03.563]  And the United States Justice Department under Obama and Holder reached in and made them stop.
[02:44:04.898 --> 02:44:05.698]  Made them stop.
[02:44:05.698 --> 02:44:07.059]  One of the few states that tried to close the door.
[02:44:07.059 --> 02:44:17.662]  And we also have multiple cabinet heads on TV saying we've got to help our people in a racial way.
[02:44:17.662 --> 02:44:24.725]  So what they do is, through political correctness, they make it all a race war with foreigners teamed up with the corrupt government.
[02:44:24.725 --> 02:44:31.267]  Now what our people out there listening to do today, I know about what the Democrats are doing here because
[02:44:32.139 --> 02:44:36.042]  Back in my more misinformed youth, I was well-programmed.
[02:44:36.042 --> 02:44:37.603]  I drove the vans, Alex.
[02:44:37.603 --> 02:44:48.472]  I worked at the campus and minority communities for the Democratic Party in the 90s before I broke my conditioning and then shook off the programming that had been put in my head.
[02:44:48.472 --> 02:44:48.812]  But this
[02:44:49.973 --> 02:44:51.094]  I know what they're going to do.
[02:44:51.094 --> 02:44:56.858]  The vans are rolling, the buses are rolling through the minority and the campus neighborhoods today.
[02:44:56.858 --> 02:45:00.180]  They're promising things politically such as amnesty and benefits.
[02:45:00.180 --> 02:45:05.584]  Harry Reid's giving people free cards that have money on them and free food.
[02:45:06.124 --> 02:45:12.651]  Oh, I guarantee you there's drugs, crack cocaine, and direct cash being handed out across this country to mobilize their voters.
[02:45:12.651 --> 02:45:14.573]  What can the people out there doing?
[02:45:14.573 --> 02:45:16.294]  Here's what you have to do.
[02:45:16.294 --> 02:45:19.518]  You have to vote, and you have to transport voters.
[02:45:19.518 --> 02:45:24.623]  The Alibac plan today, we're broadcasting through two-party groups and campaigns across the country.
[02:45:25.143 --> 02:45:32.854]  Conservative-leaning voters, or right-of-center voters, which is where the country at, do not usually like putting people in the cars and vans like the Democratic machinery do.
[02:45:32.854 --> 02:45:35.037]  But today, we want them to do it.
[02:45:35.037 --> 02:45:39.603]  Because, I voted, or I will vote, is one of the most commonly told fibs in the country.
[02:45:39.603 --> 02:45:40.385]  People mean well.
[02:45:41.125 --> 02:45:50.107]  But it's something people always answer yes, but there's a high degree over half the people that tell you they'll vote today if you're trying to mobilize voters by phone or word-of-mouth or Facebook.
[02:45:50.107 --> 02:45:53.248]  Well over half the people that tell you they're going to vote today will not.
[02:45:53.248 --> 02:46:00.109]  So here is the directives or the suggestions that we are pumping out across the country and I hope that all of your listeners today will take this to heart.
[02:46:00.109 --> 02:46:02.310]  Locate every Nobama you know.
[02:46:03.010 --> 02:46:08.156]  In your family, in your neighborhood, in your peer group, on your Facebook account.
[02:46:08.156 --> 02:46:18.909]  Most of you probably have a pretty good idea of who the Obama supporters are and who the Nobamas are because of the way the lines have been drawn through families in this country over the last two years.
[02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:28.098]  Call and go to, physically go to every Nobama you know and put them in your vehicle and take them to vote.
[02:46:28.098 --> 02:46:31.242]  You don't go in the enclosure with them, you take them to the polls.
[02:46:31.242 --> 02:46:32.803]  Go get them now.
[02:46:32.803 --> 02:46:36.967]  Be polite, but be firm and say, we need to go to the polls now.
[02:46:36.967 --> 02:46:38.529]  Put people in the cars.
[02:46:38.969 --> 02:47:07.414]  Trucks and vans and transport them to the polls and do not stop until they turn they close the polls in your face And if you think that this is too much to ask of you to defend this country, let me make it very clear You need to vote and the people you need to transport need to vote today because if they pass comprehensive immigration reform amnesty or Dream Act amnesty as Senator Reid just planned to do and plans to reintroduce in the lame duck your vote is
[02:47:07.938 --> 02:47:10.260]  It's never going to matter in this country again.
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:10.660]  That's right.
[02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:13.002]  They've already set the precedent to let illegals vote.
[02:47:13.002 --> 02:47:15.363]  We need to expose that fraud and reverse it.
[02:47:15.363 --> 02:47:26.731]  But if we don't resist it, they're going to have another 20, 30 million illegals in their families, and then we will be openly conquered by an outside mercenary force and people who say voting doesn't matter.
[02:47:26.731 --> 02:47:27.572]  We know there's fraud.
[02:47:27.572 --> 02:47:28.473]  We know there's problems.
[02:47:29.676 --> 02:47:32.737]  That's why you've got to be involved to expose it.
[02:47:32.737 --> 02:47:41.940]  We have fought back so many globalist initiatives, and we would have beaten all their initiatives if patriots would have been involved politically.
[02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:43.441]  Well, today they're pouring out of the hills.
[02:47:43.441 --> 02:47:44.541]  They must pour out of the hills.
[02:47:44.541 --> 02:47:46.962]  The only way we can beat the fraud, I mean, think about it, Alex.
[02:47:46.962 --> 02:47:51.343]  If you go watch a poll, even if you skulk around in a poll, you can't tell who's legal and not.
[02:47:51.343 --> 02:47:58.326]  You're running the risk of getting caught and being an embarrassment to our cause because you confronted somebody who was, you know, non-anglo or whatever.
[02:47:59.286 --> 02:48:08.033]  Even the polling people who are working the polls and even the State Board of Elections do not have the current power and systems in place to tell you who's legal and who's not.
[02:48:08.033 --> 02:48:10.614]  So you're not going to stop a lot of this fraud.
[02:48:10.614 --> 02:48:15.037]  We must overcome this fraud by sheer force of volume.
[02:48:15.037 --> 02:48:22.823]  We must overcome this fraud by having so many people that are like us show up and vote today that even though the Democrats and the D.C.
[02:48:22.823 --> 02:48:28.247]  Insiders cheat in several different ways, even though they vote illegally, that it does not save them.
[02:48:30.802 --> 02:48:35.207]  Now, what's the intel you're getting on the ground though?
[02:48:35.207 --> 02:48:45.418]  It sounds like you're hinting at basically agreeing with most of the mainstream media reports that this is the biggest conservative turnout in 80 years.
[02:48:45.418 --> 02:48:49.643]  It's hard to tell until it's over which strategy is going to prevail.
[02:48:49.643 --> 02:48:51.025]  The Democrats have fought back.
[02:48:51.545 --> 02:48:52.026]  We're good to go.
[02:49:04.312 --> 02:49:06.755]  Rushing the polls, voting for every Republican they can.
[02:49:06.755 --> 02:49:12.362]  And I can't say in this unusual circumstances, Alex, I would advise this is a dumb thing to do.
[02:49:12.362 --> 02:49:21.134]  But in this particular circumstance, although it's rough around the edges and somewhere along the lines you're going to push a button for a snake like Karl Rove or John McCain.
[02:49:22.014 --> 02:49:39.629]  It's really the only option is that the backlash is so excessive that it wipes and damages the liberal component of the globalist war machine so that there's a whole new political... So basically in a vote it's a carpet bombing strategy?
[02:49:40.302 --> 02:49:42.483]  It's so naked, brazen, out in the open to have the president
[02:50:01.158 --> 02:50:12.521]  Two illegal alien audiences, and that's where he's been doing the quote the last two days, that we're fighting our enemy, and the enemy is the American people, and they say if you don't want government health care, you're a racist.
[02:50:12.521 --> 02:50:16.142]  If you don't want the country to fully implode, you're a racist.
[02:50:16.142 --> 02:50:17.222]  They are the racists.
[02:50:17.222 --> 02:50:25.444]  They are the ones using racial politics, but the good news is they've so overplayed this that people don't care what they're called anymore.
[02:50:25.444 --> 02:50:26.644]  People are done.
[02:50:26.644 --> 02:50:28.025]  All these well-meaning
[02:50:29.165 --> 02:50:31.928]  Bleeding heart types like myself.
[02:50:31.928 --> 02:50:32.409]  We're done.
[02:50:32.409 --> 02:50:33.911]  We don't care.
[02:50:33.911 --> 02:50:36.414]  I don't care what a bunch of racists call me.
[02:50:36.414 --> 02:50:44.883]  You're the racist and you're the people working for the big banks, the globalists that have robbed this country and are scared we're going to take the government back and send you to prison.
[02:50:44.883 --> 02:50:46.205]  Stay there, William Gein.
[02:50:46.205 --> 02:50:48.508]  I want to come back and get some more information from you.
[02:50:49.795 --> 02:50:55.137]  I'm tempted to do a special live broadcast tonight so we can just take people's calls during the election.
[02:50:55.137 --> 02:50:56.037]  I'm thinking about doing that.
[02:50:56.037 --> 02:50:57.258]  I got to talk to my team.
[02:50:57.258 --> 02:50:59.919]  But regardless, we'll be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:50:59.919 --> 02:51:01.139]  to 2 p.m.
[02:51:01.139 --> 02:51:05.961]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:51:06.101 --> 02:51:07.102]  What have we got?
[02:51:07.102 --> 02:51:09.544]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:51:09.544 --> 02:51:10.565]  A republic.
[02:51:10.565 --> 02:51:13.207]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:51:13.207 --> 02:51:15.470]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:51:15.470 --> 02:51:17.491]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:51:17.491 --> 02:51:19.193]  So they think they own our land?
[02:51:19.193 --> 02:51:20.514]  They think they own our water?
[02:51:20.514 --> 02:51:21.115]  Children?
[02:51:21.115 --> 02:51:22.236]  Our education?
[02:51:22.236 --> 02:51:23.056]  Our money?
[02:51:23.056 --> 02:51:26.720]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:30.784]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:51:30.784 --> 02:51:32.046]  You have been warned.
[02:51:32.046 --> 02:51:33.067]  We have the facts.
[02:51:33.067 --> 02:51:34.228]  We have the Constitution.
[02:51:34.228 --> 02:51:35.150]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:36.031]  We have common law.
[02:51:36.031 --> 02:51:38.554]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:38.554 --> 02:51:42.338]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:51:42.438 --> 02:51:47.382]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:51:47.382 --> 02:51:48.883]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:51:48.883 --> 02:51:49.963]  Don't tread on me.
[02:51:49.963 --> 02:51:56.848]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:52:01.149 --> 02:52:05.230]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:52:05.230 --> 02:52:09.731]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:52:09.731 --> 02:52:15.892]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:52:15.892 --> 02:52:18.313]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:52:18.313 --> 02:52:24.274]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:52:24.414 --> 02:52:27.819]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:52:27.819 --> 02:52:29.701]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:52:29.701 --> 02:52:31.884]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:52:31.884 --> 02:52:36.770]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:52:36.770 --> 02:52:37.571]  Guaranteed.

[02:53:07.392 --> 02:53:20.979]  No matter how little you may know about the dangers of a nuclear blast or radiation sickness, you can become an emergency preparedness expert after reading Red Horse, How to Survive a Nuclear Blast or Dirty Bomb by Sam Adams.
[02:53:20.979 --> 02:53:27.743]  A must for every American home, this book is a step-by-step how-to manual for survival in the event of disaster.
[02:53:28.223 --> 02:53:37.414]  Red Horse, How to Survive a Nuclear Blast or Dirty Bomb is available for immediate digital download for only $39 at DirtyBombSurvival.com.
[02:53:37.414 --> 02:53:42.660]  Order the hard copy for just $49 plus $8 shipping from DirtyBombSurvival.com.
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:48.543]  Ladies and gentlemen, Americans went and voted for Obama because they were mad at the globalist Bush, who tried to get amnesty.
[02:54:14.327 --> 02:54:18.328]  And now they're mad at Obama, and so they're putting Republicans back in.
[02:54:18.328 --> 02:54:20.528]  But this is a different crew.
[02:54:20.528 --> 02:54:23.029]  There are a lot of bad ones in there, but also a lot of good ones.
[02:54:23.029 --> 02:54:30.590]  But it shows how fast people are politically getting sick of the last puppet and seeing the puppet master themselves.
[02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:32.051]  And that's what's so exciting about this.
[02:54:32.051 --> 02:54:33.851]  We'll know a lot more by tomorrow.
[02:54:33.851 --> 02:54:37.092]  We'll have continual coverage on who won, who lost.
[02:54:37.092 --> 02:54:37.572]  11 a.m.
[02:54:37.572 --> 02:54:38.552]  Central tomorrow.
[02:54:39.704 --> 02:54:43.585]  And we're going to have wide open phones and Bev Harris on dealing with election fraud.
[02:54:43.585 --> 02:54:46.186]  We're going to be watching it all very, very closely.
[02:54:46.186 --> 02:54:48.907]  I probably won't do a special live transmission tonight.
[02:54:48.907 --> 02:54:49.827]  I'm kind of up in the air.
[02:54:49.827 --> 02:54:52.348]  I might do one 7 to 9, 7 to 10.
[02:54:52.348 --> 02:54:57.349]  I've just got so much other work to do around here with all the other projects and finishing up the studio.
[02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:58.430]  Thanks to all of your support.
[02:54:59.450 --> 02:55:01.411]  Uh, and the films we're working on.
[02:55:01.411 --> 02:55:05.012]  Plus, I need to go home for a few hours and see my family, but that's up in the air.
[02:55:05.012 --> 02:55:10.454]  If I do decide to go live tonight, uh, you'll see an announcement at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com the next hour.
[02:55:10.454 --> 02:55:14.555]  Uh, talking to William Gein of AlleyPack.us.
[02:55:14.555 --> 02:55:20.677]  Uh, any other key points you, uh, need to telegraph to the listeners?
[02:55:20.677 --> 02:55:26.339]  A lot of your listeners out there thinking that, you know, about going and voting for Republicans today, and I think you sort of addressed it.
[02:55:26.339 --> 02:55:27.439]  I want to address that as well.
[02:55:28.394 --> 02:55:31.396]  I think that if the Republicans sweep today, it can reach.
[02:55:31.396 --> 02:55:38.341]  If it doesn't, if the House has changed its hands, and it's just by a few seats here and there, the D.C.
[02:55:38.341 --> 02:55:43.024]  insiders, the elites that know how to control and manipulate things, are going to remain in power.
[02:55:43.024 --> 02:55:51.049]  If the pendulum swings way, way over deep into Republican districts, then they're going to lose control because there's going to be a lot of people coming to D.C.
[02:55:51.049 --> 02:55:51.930]  They didn't count on it.
[02:55:52.250 --> 02:55:53.391]  Lindsey Graham?
[02:56:07.461 --> 02:56:10.003]  Yeah, don't forget our pal Lindsey.
[02:56:10.003 --> 02:56:13.005]  He still thinks about us often, Alex.
[02:56:13.005 --> 02:56:16.707]  Basically, they're going to be surrounded by a sea of new blood.
[02:56:16.707 --> 02:56:20.650]  And I'll be honest with you, a lot of them are going to be in political trouble.
[02:56:20.650 --> 02:56:23.912]  The old guard Republicans will not last long.
[02:56:23.912 --> 02:56:29.156]  Yeah, we're ramming down the door right now for 2012 and the states' rights movement.
[02:56:29.156 --> 02:56:36.941]  I mean, the system in their own internal reports that are public but aren't circulated are scared right now and it's happening all over the world.
[02:56:37.501 --> 02:56:38.201]  It is.
[02:56:38.201 --> 02:56:51.265]  And the people listening, you know, today, you know, to shows like this actually do have the power, if they'll take our advice and get in their vehicles and start traveling around, picking people up, putting people in the vehicles and transporting them.
[02:56:51.265 --> 02:56:53.585]  Yeah, call your friends and family and say, are you registered?
[02:56:53.585 --> 02:56:54.146]  Can you vote?
[02:56:54.146 --> 02:56:55.586]  Get them down there.
[02:56:55.586 --> 02:56:59.167]  But listen, I've got to say, don't just let people tell you they're going to vote.
[02:56:59.167 --> 02:57:01.488]  This is a treacherous time where we need to keep eyes on each other.
[02:57:01.488 --> 02:57:02.888]  First of all, if you're going to vote today,
[02:57:03.624 --> 02:57:13.794]  With the SEIU thugs out there, and the Black Panthers, and the Brown Berets, and the dancing voting machines that keep jumping from Republican to Democrat, it's best you vote in groups anyway.
[02:57:13.794 --> 02:57:21.881]  But don't just let people tell you they gave blood, tell you that they flossed, tell you that they washed their hands after using the bathroom, tell you that they voted or are going to vote.
[02:57:21.881 --> 02:57:27.527]  Put them into the car, transport them to vehicles by 7 o'clock tonight when the polls start closing on the East Coast.
[02:57:28.247 --> 02:57:32.010]  I am not hearing it yet, but I am on the radio bound and determined to hear it.
[02:57:32.010 --> 02:57:39.674]  I want to hear reports about people, Americans, center and center-right Americans, just bringing people to the polls.
[02:57:39.674 --> 02:57:43.596]  And by the way, it is up on Drudge and other big reports.
[02:57:43.596 --> 02:57:45.958]  The Black Panthers are out there with the Billy Clubs again.
[02:57:45.958 --> 02:57:47.599]  So are the Brown Berets.
[02:57:47.599 --> 02:57:49.300]  I mean, what a group of nuts.
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:53.124]  I mean, and then the Justice Department won't prosecute him.
[02:57:53.124 --> 02:58:01.894]  Can you imagine if a libertarian or a conservative was out there with a billy club in front of a polling place saying, kill all the white people?
[02:58:01.894 --> 02:58:03.116]  Can you imagine what would happen?
[02:58:04.417 --> 02:58:06.278]  Well, they'd be on every channel across the place.
[02:58:06.278 --> 02:58:12.740]  There's another example of this evil Anglo-American who is the epitome of all that is wrong in the world.
[02:58:12.740 --> 02:58:14.481]  You know, it'd be a whole different story.
[02:58:14.481 --> 02:58:18.623]  We're going to put out a new alert on this at alipac.us, Alex.
[02:58:18.623 --> 02:58:23.125]  We're going to put one out in about 15-20 minutes at alipac.us.
[02:58:23.125 --> 02:58:28.847]  We'd love to have your listeners get on our email alert list to receive that information about what they can do in these final hours to help the revolution.
[02:58:29.267 --> 02:58:29.989]  All right.
[02:58:29.989 --> 02:58:34.096]  Look forward to speaking to you again in the next few days to give us updates on what happened.
[02:58:34.096 --> 02:58:35.619]  William, thank you so much.
[02:58:35.619 --> 02:58:36.561]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:36.561 --> 02:58:36.841]  All right.
[02:58:36.841 --> 02:58:37.843]  Key intel coming up.
[02:58:37.843 --> 02:58:38.965]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:38.965 --> 02:58:39.446]  Stay with us.
