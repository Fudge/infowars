[00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:08.917]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:10.498]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:12.060]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.243]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.243 --> 00:00:24.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.932]  Well, my friends, it's official.
[00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:30.375]  Obama is trying, along with the Globalists, to direct the FCC
[00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:49.941]  To take over the internet and non-broadcast television, and to set up these political officers, these commissars, literally out of the old Soviet Union, to come in and inspect your media operation for political correctness.
[00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:55.765]  And even the FCC's head has been saying he's against some of what the board wants to do.
[00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.607]  But again, it's like a city council or something.
[00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:00.388]  We had good FCC head back in 1988.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.824]  Spurred on by the Deputy Head, the Deputy Commissioner, I guess you'd call him, and that's Bruce Fine.
[00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:14.666]  And by the way, let's get Bruce Fine on immediately.
[00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.847]  I mean, today if he can do it.
[00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:31.556]  I don't know why I didn't click to get the guy who spearheaded ending the Fairness Doctrine on to ask the top lawyer expert that advises Congress, and Ron Paul, Rand Paul, you name it, Ted Cruz, we need to get him on to find out how he thinks we should kill this.
[00:01:32.794 --> 00:01:38.842]  DrudgeReport.com has the headline, and it's true, Feds Warn Drudge Faces Regulation.
[00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:42.787]  And the news site that he linked to crashed.
[00:01:42.787 --> 00:01:50.036]  And remember, last week, I directed my writers, and they did do some stories on this, but quite frankly, they weren't sensational enough.
[00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:56.274]  I mean, if aliens land in Central Park, you run the headline, aliens land in Central Park.
[00:01:56.274 --> 00:02:06.246]  If the government's trying to come in with web taxes, web tracking, the end of free internet, and by free, the free movement of info, you call it total takeover of the internet.
[00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:11.492]  Paul Watson did do a report on that, but the next issue of the magazine,
[00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:15.204]  Not the one that just came out, 1776 Part 2.
[00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:17.507]  But the next issue, I want it on.
[00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:19.649]  Hey, are you ready for the end of Internet freedom?
[00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:20.450]  Because it's here.
[00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.991]  It ain't coming.
[00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:22.852]  It's being announced.
[00:02:22.852 --> 00:02:27.137]  The keys to the Internet are being given to the UN so they can claim, oh, the UN did it.
[00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.420]  Look, I've got mainstream news articles here.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.982]  The Hill, FCC's grab for new regulatory power could go beyond broadband providers.
[00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:39.443]  No kidding.
[00:02:39.443 --> 00:02:47.725]  I've read last week the new rule changes and it says, even over political speech and everything, and it ends net neutrality.
[00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:49.726]  I mean, it's the end of the Internet, folks.
[00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:53.947]  They've already built the new one where you have no rights and are biometrically accessing it.
[00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:55.808]  Three strikes, no judge, no jury.
[00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.389]  You're banned from the Internet into an electronic ghetto.
[00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:01.955]  Because we're dependent on the web now.
[00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:11.482]  Net neutrality's death could spark populist revolt with echoes of the Gilded Age, Washington coddles moneyed monopolistic internet barons.
[00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:14.864]  Oh yeah, you know who's going along with all this.
[00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:15.544]  Microsoft.
[00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:21.148]  Now Google acts like they're against it on the surface, but it is a fake resistance.
[00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:22.869]  Because most of their employees are good people.
[00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.291]  I mean they are, I know some of them.
[00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:26.812]  Most of the people at YouTube are good people.
[00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:33.856]  They don't like what's happening, so the Google execs are like, oh yeah, we're concerned about this.
[00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:37.458]  Well, you're not really concerned about it, because I've looked at the money that's being given.
[00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:41.741]  They're giving money for Internet 2, the end of the Internet.
[00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.703]  They don't call it the end of the Internet, they call it Internet 2, like it's something new, like smart meters.
[00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:47.664]  A box in your car that taxes you.
[00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:48.565]  Doesn't that sound great?
[00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:49.686]  It's got smart in front of it.
[00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:55.606]  You're like walking up to your neighbor with a baseball bat and going, this is smart baseball bat!
[00:03:55.606 --> 00:04:01.069]  And whacking them across the nose, smashing their nose or knocking their teeth out and going, don't call the police!
[00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.330]  It's smart!
[00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.993]  Smart Louisville Slugger on the side.
[00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:11.915]  Well, we're very dumb to go along with all this, so there's some of those headlines.
[00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:15.998]  They're not going to let us in their monopoly of media control.
[00:04:15.998 --> 00:04:20.140]  They're going to try to shut us down, but people have a hunger for liberty and it
[00:04:21.098 --> 00:04:25.802]  We can go offshore now, if we have to, and run InfoWars.
[00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:27.724]  And there'll be ways for people to get around it.
[00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:35.791]  But as we get curtailed, remember InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com may not be here in the future for easy access.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.485]  You've got to download, save our video and audio reports, because they'll be evergreen ten years from now.
[00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:45.688]  You've got to save the text reports, you've got to save everything.
[00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:50.652]  Because they want to convert over to the cloud, where they can erase everything and memory hole it.
[00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:56.317]  We're going to break down the strategy to end free speech globally, and our strategy to crush the enemy.
[00:04:56.317 --> 00:04:57.438]  It is an info war.
[00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:03.308]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:07.692]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:11.356]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:14.379]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:21.726]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:25.870]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.274]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:36.259]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.322]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:05:40.322 --> 00:05:42.945]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:44.286]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:05:44.426 --> 00:05:45.787]  It's time to take action.
[00:05:45.787 --> 00:05:47.609]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:02.329]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:07.477]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:15.309]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:20.110]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.092]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:30.033]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:33.194]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:38.316]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:38.576 --> 00:06:46.721]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:47.061]  That's 866-229-0927.

[00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:08.278]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:16.686]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:21.351]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:28.335]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:35.499]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:42.523]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:42.523 --> 00:07:46.886]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:50.388]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:56.691]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:00.713]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:06.596]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:13.960]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:23.921]  Well, we've got some really good news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:49.553]  Of the three different things that could happen generally with the Ukraine crisis, this is the middle road.
[00:08:49.553 --> 00:09:02.688]  The best scenario would be that George Soros, NATO, and the globalists that have seized Europe and the US wouldn't have overthrown the elected Ukrainian government that didn't want to join the EU and didn't want to join Russia as well.
[00:09:04.304 --> 00:09:19.093]  The West wouldn't have overthrown that government and destabilized the entire region in an attempt to get a new Marshall Plan, tens of trillions of dollars pumped into the globalist coffers in the name of stabilizing Europe that they have destabilized.
[00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:23.096]  So the best scenario would be that this never happened.
[00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:26.178]  The next best scenario is that Russia
[00:09:27.719 --> 00:09:41.710]  Just basically lets NATO steal Ukraine and loot the resources and put the people deeper into debt as they're now doing under the IMF because at least it doesn't start World War III.
[00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.192]  We sacrifice Ukraine to the New World Order.
[00:09:44.192 --> 00:09:47.075]  It's one more country that they've gobbled up like the blob.
[00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:57.809]  The problem with that is they're just going to move on to the next country on Russia's border and do it and become emboldened, but at least it pushes the can down the road a little bit.
[00:09:57.809 --> 00:09:58.651]  It kicks the can.
[00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:18.825]  The really bad scenario is that the Russians who have been clearly with paramilitary forces shooting down helicopters, Ukrainian government-controlled, Soros-controlled helicopters that have been attacking civilian targets, the Russians are opening up with
[00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:24.467]  What looks like surface-to-air shoulder launch missiles and shooting down the helicopters.
[00:10:24.467 --> 00:10:35.450]  But in video after video, we showed one yesterday, the helicopter opens fire, the Russians then, from a whole other direction, you see a missile come up and shoot the helicopter down.
[00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:45.873]  So the Russians are sitting there with missiles waiting, the helicopter comes in, attacks a police station, attacks a church, attacks a group of protesters, the Russians then shoot it down.
[00:10:45.873 --> 00:10:48.274]  If NATO calls in airstrikes on those Russians,
[00:10:49.707 --> 00:10:51.609]  The Russians will then start responding.
[00:10:51.609 --> 00:11:05.020]  But for whatever reason, probably because the criminals that run our government are targeting the criminals in the Russian government, and are targeting their Swiss bank accounts, Putin is backing off at least for now.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:10.744]  Now that could be a military feint, but quite frankly Russia's been in a defensive mode
[00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:17.130]  And again, I don't romanticize Russia, but they are not trying to sterilize the U.S.
[00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.730]  population.
[00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.152]  They're not trying to break up the family.
[00:11:19.152 --> 00:11:21.974]  They're not trying to put cancer viruses in vaccines.
[00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:24.576]  They're not teaching their kids 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:11:24.576 --> 00:11:26.898]  The Russians are doing nothing to us.
[00:11:26.898 --> 00:11:32.803]  The Chinese globalists are running all over us, totally taking over, working with the globalists inside the U.S.
[00:11:32.803 --> 00:11:34.165]  China is a massive threat.
[00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:43.015]  And censoring our media, censoring Hollywood, just involved all over the world as the UN Global Army Enforcer.
[00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:45.516]  They will be the troops for the UN Army.
[00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:52.500]  In every globalist document, 7277, 1963, you name it, look it up.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.483]  But the good news is, New York Times, Putin says Russian forces withdrew from Ukraine border.
[00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:01.525]  And I don't just believe the New York Times, I went to the Russian ITAR-TASS and RT,
[00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:06.901]  They basically now merged all those systems into RT Global.
[00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:08.482]  And he indeed said that.
[00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:21.390]  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that Russian troops had pulled back from the Ukrainian border and he urged separatists in eastern Ukraine to postpone a referendum planned for Sunday.
[00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.871]  So you heard that.
[00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.372]  The separatists have the votes.
[00:12:24.372 --> 00:12:26.333]  It's mainly Russian in the east.
[00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.434]  They're going to vote to split away.
[00:12:28.434 --> 00:12:30.575]  And NATO and
[00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:39.554]  Others are on record, along with the Ukrainians, saying, in Der Spiegel and in the London Guardian, this will be World War III.
[00:12:39.554 --> 00:12:41.515]  We are preparing to attack Russia.
[00:12:41.515 --> 00:12:42.516]  We're preparing.
[00:12:42.516 --> 00:12:49.079]  And so Russia has blinked, ladies and gentlemen, and is pulling back.
[00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:51.460]  And I predict NATO will just continue to attack.
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.061]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:12:54.061 --> 00:12:56.122]  They're not going to stop.
[00:12:56.122 --> 00:12:57.803]  Because it's okay, because they're liberal.
[00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:06.633]  It's okay if our government funds Al-Qaeda to murder Christians all over Africa and the Middle East because, well, I mean, Obama's black.
[00:13:06.633 --> 00:13:09.494]  And it's okay, he has a peace prize, folks.
[00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:18.677]  And it's okay if they slaughter 40,000 blacks in Libya because the Al-Qaeda people are racist against blacks because Obama's black.
[00:13:18.677 --> 00:13:23.499]  And it's okay if Ukrainian troops and tanks are massing all along the Russian border because, I mean, look,
[00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.971]  George Soros said so.
[00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:29.974]  And look, Obama said that it's a duly elected government.
[00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:31.556]  We'll cue that up later and play it.
[00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:32.597]  I mean, it's not elected.
[00:13:32.597 --> 00:13:34.358]  It was overthrown, the Ukrainian government.
[00:13:34.358 --> 00:13:35.459]  Everybody knows that.
[00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:36.260]  But so what?
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.121]  He said it's duly elected.
[00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:42.785]  And so the duly elected governments must be overthrown now.
[00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:46.528]  Because the coup government's not duly elected because it is duly elected.
[00:13:46.528 --> 00:13:47.689]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:48.510]  So, there you go.
[00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.070]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:49.791]  That's the way it is.
[00:13:51.837 --> 00:14:01.233]  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that Russian troops had pulled back from the Ukrainian border and he urged separatists in eastern Ukraine to postpone a referendum planned for Sunday.
[00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:02.094]  He's saying stand down.
[00:14:03.194 --> 00:14:23.872]  I guess the Russians just love their kids, and they say discretion is the greater part of valor, and I guess they've shot down enough Ukrainian helicopters and blown up enough of their tanks, and so now they've been given the word that NATO is going to start full-bore military operations in World War III.
[00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:27.755]  That's the only reason Russia would back down like this.
[00:14:27.755 --> 00:14:29.137]  And I bet money
[00:14:31.095 --> 00:14:31.335]  That
[00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:49.721]  Says we must consider permanent troops in Eastern Europe.
[00:14:49.721 --> 00:15:01.287]  I mean, this is a build-up on the Russian border by the narcotics trafficking, child trafficking, most corrupt agency outside the Chinese Communist government, NATO.
[00:15:01.287 --> 00:15:06.530]  NATO is unmitigatedly evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.872]  They run all the criminal operations, basically, in Europe.
[00:15:09.872 --> 00:15:11.973]  The organized crime, everything.
[00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:13.033]  That's what NATO is.
[00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:14.954]  That's why Bilderberg created it.
[00:15:14.954 --> 00:15:16.015]  That is Spectre.
[00:15:18.427 --> 00:15:23.150]  To use a Ian Fleming OSS term.
[00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.992]  They are Hail Hydra, cut off one head, two more grow.
[00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:33.336]  And there is no amount of appeasement that Russia can engage in.
[00:15:33.336 --> 00:15:37.459]  Now again, some said there could be a double game where Russia would partition and get half of Ukraine.
[00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:50.781]  And that could end up going there, but the globalists under Cheney, who was the real president, backed off when they did the probing operation in 2008 in Georgia.
[00:15:54.645 --> 00:15:57.167]  This time, Russia is backing down.
[00:15:57.167 --> 00:15:59.529]  So I want to ask the listeners, where do you think this is going to go?
[00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:01.971]  I want to ask veterans.
[00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:04.333]  I want to ask Eastern Europeans.
[00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:05.474]  I want to ask Russians.
[00:16:05.474 --> 00:16:07.616]  I want to ask anybody in England, Europe.
[00:16:07.616 --> 00:16:09.437]  I mean, you're all really affected by this.
[00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:10.938]  Americans are as well.
[00:16:10.938 --> 00:16:14.681]  So we'll have open phones for first-time callers, even if you're from the U.S.
[00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:16.102]  or Israel or Germany.
[00:16:16.102 --> 00:16:16.623]  It doesn't matter.
[00:16:16.623 --> 00:16:17.383]  Everybody's affected.
[00:16:17.383 --> 00:16:19.565]  Or Japan, by a nuclear war.
[00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:21.767]  But this is really happening.
[00:16:21.767 --> 00:16:26.291]  And they've got Russian ships off our coast, Russian bombers off the coast.
[00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:29.753]  I mean, this is really kicking up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:29.753 --> 00:16:31.335]  And the globalists are initiating it.
[00:16:31.335 --> 00:16:32.416]  So here's the toll-free number.
[00:16:32.416 --> 00:16:32.476]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:32.856]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:32.856 --> 00:16:35.378]  If you're outside the country, dial your country access code.
[00:16:35.378 --> 00:16:35.538]  And 651-695-7755.
[00:16:50.518 --> 00:16:56.664]  That's 651-695-7755 is the international line.
[00:16:56.664 --> 00:17:00.807]  And let's open up our phone system here for folks strictly in Europe.
[00:17:00.807 --> 00:17:01.728]  Eastern Europe particularly.
[00:17:01.728 --> 00:17:04.110]  Love to hear from Ukraine or Russia.
[00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:08.214]  Dial your country code at 877-789-ALEX.
[00:17:08.214 --> 00:17:09.695]  877-789-2539.
[00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:15.641]  That'll take a few minutes to get our phone system turned on here, but you got the network system up in Minnesota.
[00:17:15.641 --> 00:17:16.782]  They route through our offices.
[00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:19.005]  And then we've got our own phone system.
[00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:22.850]  We have redundancy here because occasionally there are problems a couple times a year.
[00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.377]  We like to have backup so you can use both systems today and we can see if somebody from Europe can get in.
[00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:32.174]  So that's really our top story.
[00:17:32.174 --> 00:17:36.395]  Then there's a massive public attack that they're not talking about now.
[00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:43.137]  It's here, the end of free speech, the end of the new media, the end of the Drudge Report, the end of InfoWars.
[00:17:43.137 --> 00:17:46.158]  And that is what the FCC Chairman is saying in a headline.
[00:17:46.158 --> 00:17:50.319]  At Drudge, FCC Chairman, Drudge could be blocked under new rules.
[00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:54.487]  And we'll show that headline for folks right now.
[00:17:54.487 --> 00:17:55.948]  We're going to do our own articles again.
[00:17:55.948 --> 00:17:58.009]  We did, I covered this last week in Warren People.
[00:17:58.009 --> 00:17:58.730]  Now it's breaking.
[00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.951]  We need all of our reporters to write on this again today.
[00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:03.973]  And we need to, and print that for me guys.
[00:18:03.973 --> 00:18:04.733]  Thank you.
[00:18:04.733 --> 00:18:07.515]  And we need to really have all the real media focused on this.
[00:18:08.632 --> 00:18:11.754]  Like eight cylinders all hitting in unison, or they're going to get away with this.
[00:18:11.754 --> 00:18:16.738]  So I also want to break down the attack on the First Amendment and the integrity of the Internet.
[00:18:16.738 --> 00:18:22.121]  Not just free speech, but your business, your company that isn't an insider group, you're going to be shot out and discriminated against.
[00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:25.304]  That's mainstream news saying that.
[00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:26.765]  So we're going to discuss that attack.
[00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:31.192]  And then how I think we should counter it.
[00:18:31.192 --> 00:18:36.374]  But going back to that Washington Examiner headline, we'll put that back on screen.
[00:18:36.374 --> 00:18:45.678]  FCC chair warns that conservative media like Drudge Report and Sean Hannity face regulations like PACs, like PACs.
[00:18:45.678 --> 00:18:50.300]  And that dovetails into a whole flotilla of attacks on the internet.
[00:18:52.583 --> 00:19:03.570]  This new special office that the Boston Herald two weeks ago called chilling free speech, chilling and draconian.
[00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.011]  That's a major newspaper calling it that.
[00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:09.894]  So there's a bunch of stuff happening.
[00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:20.380]  Where they're now going to say we don't care if you're not tax exempt, you're not going to be a media outlet like talk radio under the fairness doctrine and say we need to vote Obama out of office, he's a horrible person.
[00:19:22.413 --> 00:19:29.159]  We had the Fairness Doctrine until 1988, and you had 10 different Democratic Senators the last couple years call for it.
[00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:35.224]  They're bringing it back under a new name, and they're getting ready to launch all these wars, the economy's imploding.
[00:19:35.224 --> 00:19:38.147]  This is when they're going to try to censor things, like during the Civil War.
[00:19:39.215 --> 00:19:41.037]  In the 1860s.
[00:19:41.037 --> 00:19:41.938]  It's here.
[00:19:41.938 --> 00:19:43.040]  It isn't a drill.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.741]  It isn't a game.
[00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:45.603]  I've been telling you it's coming.
[00:19:45.603 --> 00:19:49.307]  All of the perfect storm alignments are now happening.
[00:19:49.307 --> 00:19:52.691]  So you better appreciate InfoWars.com.
[00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:56.035]  You better appreciate the real media now.
[00:19:56.035 --> 00:19:57.597]  Because they're coming after it.
[00:19:57.597 --> 00:19:58.578]  We're on the enemy's list.
[00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.072]  Harvest Right is the world's first in-home freeze-dryer.

[00:21:58.675 --> 00:21:59.995]  Attention America!
[00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:07.617]  Within a little-known government document is devastating information that could cost the United States its most valuable asset.
[00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:10.998]  My name is Jeff Opdycke, former reporter for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:20.180]  I've uncovered shocking evidence within the details of document FT-900, revealing the largest cover-up of President Obama's career.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.660]  This will have a substantial impact on our nation.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.821]  Millions of Americans will fall into poverty overnight.
[00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:34.686]  A recent report from the Treasury Department said an event of this nature has, quote, the potential to be catastrophic.
[00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:44.573]  Within a matter of weeks, the way of life for millions of Americans will be destroyed, and the standard of living will be like nothing this country has seen in nearly a century.
[00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:53.118]  To learn how you can protect yourself and your family from this government attack, visit www.ObamaSecret1.com.
[00:22:53.118 --> 00:22:56.460]  Again, that's www.ObamaSecret1.com.
[00:22:57.941 --> 00:23:01.582]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:23:01.582 --> 00:23:05.403]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:11.584]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:23:11.584 --> 00:23:21.807]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[00:23:21.807 --> 00:23:26.208]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terraganic.
[00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:36.616]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.

[00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:51.293]  Call Terragenics at 866-369-3678 or visit terragenics.com.
[00:23:51.293 --> 00:23:52.095]  T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:26.770]  To quote Vladimir Putin on his announced pullback from the Ukrainian border,
[00:24:47.714 --> 00:24:50.715]  Russia positioned 40,000 troops at least on the border.
[00:24:50.715 --> 00:24:54.217]  Meanwhile, NATO is pouring troops into Ukraine.
[00:24:54.217 --> 00:25:02.661]  Advisors, CIA, the director of the CIA has been there, and they're pouring them into Poland and other areas.
[00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:08.004]  And they are moving them in up against the Russian border and saying they're going to permanently be there.
[00:25:08.004 --> 00:25:09.364]  That's what's being pushed.
[00:25:09.364 --> 00:25:12.286]  This is outrageous.
[00:25:12.286 --> 00:25:13.626]  Major provocation.
[00:25:13.626 --> 00:25:14.307]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:25:15.316 --> 00:25:21.438]  The West tried to get the Ukraine to go under the EU and be annexed.
[00:25:21.438 --> 00:25:34.402]  They see the EU like the blob, like a giant demonic amoeba, eating these countries, appointing presidents, bankrupting everything, stealing the pension funds, nationalizing everything, handing it over to the globalists.
[00:25:34.402 --> 00:25:39.904]  It's not privatization, it's robbing and calling it privatization.
[00:25:39.904 --> 00:25:41.104]  And they say, we don't want to join that.
[00:25:42.028 --> 00:25:56.124]  And then they overthrow the government, call them freedom fighters, and then some of the Russian folks, who've been there forever, when it was part of Russia, say, we don't want to be under this, and they send tanks and helicopters in to kill them, and our media calls it wonderful and beautiful.
[00:25:56.124 --> 00:26:00.228]  And then Obama says that this is a duly elected government.
[00:26:00.228 --> 00:26:03.272]  It was not elected, it was appointed by the looters.
[00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:13.212]  If a million of us go to Washington and burn something down and then say we make this guy our leader, that's a dictator.
[00:26:13.212 --> 00:26:17.795]  That's going from one corrupt oligarchy to a dictatorship.
[00:26:17.795 --> 00:26:30.524]  If we ever overthrew a corrupt government, that's our right in the Declaration of Independence and in common sense, it's an organic right, we would have to then have national referendums and elect leaders again.
[00:26:30.524 --> 00:26:33.707]  It would be done, obviously, in the best systems at the state level.
[00:26:33.707 --> 00:26:35.328]  Reconstituting the republic is my plan.
[00:26:36.212 --> 00:26:39.914]  Having a revolution to restore the republic means it's really a restoration.
[00:26:39.914 --> 00:26:42.595]  And many constitutional scholars agree with me.
[00:26:42.595 --> 00:26:44.716]  Bruce Fine and many others.
[00:26:44.716 --> 00:26:53.100]  Bruce Fine, by the way, is on tomorrow about the multi-pronged attack to take over the internet by the FCC and others.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.942]  That the FCC head says we'll censor free speech of Drudge Report.
[00:26:56.942 --> 00:26:58.263]  By name.
[00:26:58.263 --> 00:27:00.964]  That the White House is obsessed with it and says, how do we shut it down?
[00:27:00.964 --> 00:27:01.765]  Well, this is how they do it.
[00:27:03.763 --> 00:27:04.603]  We're gonna break that down.
[00:27:04.603 --> 00:27:07.284]  I mean, this is all happening and it's all connected.
[00:27:07.284 --> 00:27:09.345]  They're not going after the free speech for nothing.
[00:27:09.345 --> 00:27:22.270]  They're getting ready to kill the dollar, hammer the value of everything in this country, bring us into a depression to break our will, and Obama is saying that a coup government is elected.
[00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.551]  Folks, that's a total lie.
[00:27:24.551 --> 00:27:27.052]  That's 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:27:27.052 --> 00:27:28.753]  Our new flag, the American flag,
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:56.870]  I want our graphics department to have a new American flag that we put out on the Twitter and we put out on the Facebook that is the blue area is a 2 plus 2 equals 5 and then in the bottom white stripe it says the new official flag of Common Core or the new official Obama flag.
[00:27:58.789 --> 00:28:02.170]  The new official brainwashing flag of Common Core.
[00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:06.771]  I mean, our flag should be 2 plus 2 equals 5, just like Orwell said in 1984.
[00:28:06.771 --> 00:28:10.671]  The ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is everything.
[00:28:10.671 --> 00:28:15.312]  Because if you can do that, you can say, this is not unelected government.
[00:28:15.312 --> 00:28:18.033]  It was appointed by NATO.
[00:28:18.033 --> 00:28:24.734]  Just like in Greece, just like in Italy, they have appointed presidents by the IMF and World Bank.
[00:28:25.942 --> 00:28:32.066]  It doesn't matter though, Obama says, we'll play the clip right now, Obama says it's duly elected, here it is!
[00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:51.600]  What they cannot accept, understandably, is the notion that they are simply an appendage, an extension of Russia, and that the Kremlin has veto power over decisions made by a duly elected government in Kiev.
[00:28:54.659 --> 00:29:06.082]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, that is like saying that... That is like saying that... Lenin was elected.
[00:29:06.082 --> 00:29:06.882]  Lenin was not elected.
[00:29:06.882 --> 00:29:09.582]  They overthrew the government and took over.
[00:29:09.582 --> 00:29:15.384]  That's like saying Julius Caesar was elected.
[00:29:15.384 --> 00:29:19.485]  He just took power.
[00:29:19.485 --> 00:29:19.905]  I mean, this is 1984.
[00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:31.393]  When the president does not get called by any prostitute whore media, the president does not get called on saying 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:35.386]  And we got a generation of kids being actually taught that.
[00:29:35.386 --> 00:29:37.467]  I mean, that is the biggest slap in the face.
[00:29:37.467 --> 00:29:38.387]  All of this is.
[00:29:38.387 --> 00:29:40.088]  These people are not liberals.
[00:29:40.088 --> 00:29:48.829]  They are flaming, fascist, brainwashing, psych warfare, gibbering criminals with a lust to destroy reality.
[00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:50.210]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.730]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.470]  Alex Jones.
[00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.431]  Stay with us, we're getting into the internet attack coming up.
[00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:07.664]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:30:07.664 --> 00:30:10.027]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:30:10.027 --> 00:30:15.372]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:30:15.372 --> 00:30:20.478]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:30:20.598 --> 00:30:24.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.123]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:30:28.123 --> 00:30:32.526]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:30:32.526 --> 00:30:42.873]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:30:42.873 --> 00:30:45.435]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:30:45.575 --> 00:30:51.441]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:52.401]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:31:10.979 --> 00:31:13.682]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:31:13.682 --> 00:31:18.025]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:31:18.025 --> 00:31:21.288]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:31:21.288 --> 00:31:28.735]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:31:28.735 --> 00:31:33.059]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:34.861]  We are the true media.
[00:31:34.861 --> 00:31:37.463]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:31:37.523 --> 00:31:41.284]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.811]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:32:03.811 --> 00:32:06.232]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:32:06.232 --> 00:32:14.815]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:32:14.815 --> 00:32:22.778]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[00:32:23.118 --> 00:32:31.146]  Super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.

[00:33:17.432 --> 00:33:22.957]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:22.957 --> 00:33:27.661]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.113 --> 00:33:49.867]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are here back live.
[00:33:49.867 --> 00:33:51.515]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:53.266 --> 00:33:58.951]  It is simply a huge development that Russia is pulling its troops back from the border, but that's not even the big issue.
[00:33:58.951 --> 00:34:11.161]  Putin also told separatist Russians that are the majority in eastern Ukraine to not have a referendum in multiple cities this weekend, and that basically Russia is not going to accept them into Russia.
[00:34:11.161 --> 00:34:18.787]  So, on the surface, it's a complete capitulation by Vladimir V. Putin.
[00:34:19.952 --> 00:34:23.954]  Two George Soros, NATO, the Rothschilds and the New World Order.
[00:34:23.954 --> 00:34:29.257]  Because they threatened to grab the senior Russian command's Swiss bank accounts.
[00:34:29.257 --> 00:34:30.338]  This is global governance.
[00:34:30.338 --> 00:34:32.199]  This is the total control.
[00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:37.401]  The Swiss socialists are all on record above the law and do not have to pay taxes.
[00:34:37.401 --> 00:34:39.102]  That's all over the Swiss news.
[00:34:39.102 --> 00:34:43.525]  All raising taxes to 101% on the middle class to destroy them last year.
[00:34:45.538 --> 00:34:55.740]  And we have another amazing article showing the fact that Russia is set for destruction by the globalists and China is to be used.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:13.923]  If you look at State Department memorandum 7277 and the police exchange program that Bernadine Smith and others have tirelessly exposed, back in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s when there was no alternative media, they would just put in the newspaper, hey, Chinese troops are here in town helping run checkpoints.
[00:35:15.052 --> 00:35:21.844]  And Czechoslovakian troops, Czech Republic troops, are in Scotland running checkpoints.
[00:35:21.844 --> 00:35:24.628]  And Israeli troops are in California running checkpoints.
[00:35:26.323 --> 00:35:28.784]  I mean, I've gotten video of this myself.
[00:35:28.784 --> 00:35:39.107]  And then they send foreign troops to Israel and the Czech Republic, and they send American troops there to run checkpoints, and then American troops to Canada to run checkpoints during the last Winter Olympics there.
[00:35:39.107 --> 00:35:41.047]  That was in the major papers.
[00:35:41.047 --> 00:35:41.948]  Look it up.
[00:35:41.948 --> 00:35:42.328]  U.S.
[00:35:42.328 --> 00:35:44.268]  troops patrol Canada.
[00:35:44.268 --> 00:35:47.689]  And it showed them checking people's I.D.
[00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:52.051]  in the bar district of, you know, major cities on the front of the paper.
[00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:52.811]  We covered that here.
[00:35:54.207 --> 00:36:02.616]  It's bad to have your own troops randomly checking your IDs in the middle of the road or on a bar district.
[00:36:02.616 --> 00:36:06.059]  And they have the National Guard, State Guards doing it everywhere to acclimate people.
[00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:07.761]  Then you bring in foreign troops.
[00:36:07.761 --> 00:36:15.809]  This is French News Agency, Agency French Press, AFP, Chinese Police to help patrol Paris streets.
[00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:17.371]  You just heard me read that.
[00:36:19.184 --> 00:36:27.126]  And of course they've got a reason why a million Chinese tourists come a year and some of them have been mugged.
[00:36:27.126 --> 00:36:31.248]  Oh my goodness, by the giant third world populations that are in France.
[00:36:31.248 --> 00:36:35.249]  And the reason I won't go to France, because everybody I know that goes there says they get mugged.
[00:36:35.249 --> 00:36:38.610]  I don't care if you're Chinese, black, white, what you are.
[00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:44.912]  You get mugged by the Euro trash and by the giant third world populations that have poured into France.
[00:36:44.912 --> 00:36:48.533]  And the police will do nothing when the young hoods burn cities.
[00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:57.172]  They're too busy taking two-hour lunches and eating fine salads.
[00:36:57.172 --> 00:37:15.178]  Max Keiser describing why he left France and he said, they'll be rioting and burning buildings and the French riot cops are throwing fits and eating the finest meals with literal tablecloths and tables they set up in the streets while people are burning things and they will have their French cuisine.
[00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:18.786]  And I'm not bashing the French.
[00:37:18.786 --> 00:37:23.150]  They have a lot of beautiful culture and the rest of it, but it shows what decadence turns a country into.
[00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.052]  We certainly have our own problems.
[00:37:25.052 --> 00:37:29.877]  They're not having kids in France.
[00:37:29.877 --> 00:37:31.258]  They've given up.
[00:37:31.258 --> 00:37:37.464]  He talked about how in their apartment it was leaking for two weeks in the summer, flooding the whole building.
[00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:55.168]  He said it was like a ten-story building, flooding it from five floors up and dripping into the main concierge area and he would go and say, you've got to do something and there was one person there saying, sorry, everyone's on vacation till the ceiling fell in.
[00:37:55.168 --> 00:37:56.709]  This is decadence, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:00.043 --> 00:38:06.568]  A 100% tax, though, if you actually try to make a million euros a year.
[00:38:06.568 --> 00:38:09.370]  You already paid 70-plus percent federal tax there.
[00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.171]  Now it's gone to 101%.
[00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:18.798]  So you just give up, shut down, and only let big chains and globalist operations operate, who are exempt.
[00:38:18.798 --> 00:38:26.023]  They're exempt from almost all the taxes and the French socialist, the scum of Earth.
[00:38:26.023 --> 00:38:27.304]  The model for America.
[00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.986]  Obama, two years ago, hired
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:42.284]  The top French Marxist, forget her name, you can pull it up, female, top economist of France, to set US policy.
[00:38:42.284 --> 00:38:42.865]  You can look it up.
[00:38:42.865 --> 00:38:52.168]  In fact, the headline is, Obama hires a French economist to economic council.
[00:38:52.168 --> 00:38:56.370]  And this woman, they call her a socialist, you look her up, she's a hardcore Marxist.
[00:39:00.376 --> 00:39:02.937]  And this is who is going to run the country.
[00:39:02.937 --> 00:39:05.358]  And remember, all the big billionaires, they love it!
[00:39:05.358 --> 00:39:06.618]  All the George Soros' love it!
[00:39:06.618 --> 00:39:08.679]  And I know I said I'd take your calls.
[00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:10.999]  I'm ranting and going off on the same jag every day.
[00:39:10.999 --> 00:39:14.520]  Renowned French economist to join Obama team.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.642]  Looks like a 12-year-old boy.
[00:39:18.642 --> 00:39:21.102]  But she's a woman, so it's okay.
[00:39:21.102 --> 00:39:25.044]  Is that Rachel Maddow, the same cloning tank?
[00:39:25.044 --> 00:39:26.124]  Or is that Janet Reno's daughter?
[00:39:27.196 --> 00:39:29.238]  Or is that big sister's younger clone?
[00:39:29.238 --> 00:39:31.219]  Let's scroll down and read about her.
[00:39:31.219 --> 00:39:32.380]  That's Frances Lee Ward.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.584]  Frances Esther Duflo, a star!
[00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:37.765]  Oh, you're a star!
[00:39:39.545 --> 00:39:47.471]  Economist, when you go to be part of the sex trade, you know, in California and get ripped off and get... You're a star, though, so it's okay.
[00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:48.012]  It's just the same thing.
[00:39:48.012 --> 00:39:50.033]  You're a star when you vote for Obama.
[00:39:50.033 --> 00:39:51.695]  You're a star when you're a commie.
[00:39:51.695 --> 00:39:58.120]  A star economist who was once named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world has been nominated by U.S.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.881]  President Obama to help shape U.S.
[00:39:59.881 --> 00:40:03.504]  global development policy.
[00:40:03.504 --> 00:40:06.646]  And they just launder all our tax money out of the IMF and World Bank.
[00:40:06.646 --> 00:40:07.707]  Oh, thank you!
[00:40:07.707 --> 00:40:07.847]  Yay!
[00:40:10.213 --> 00:40:12.374]  Let me get back to this.
[00:40:12.374 --> 00:40:22.438]  Chinese police, to help patrol Paris streets, well they already patrol Hollywood, can't have anything criticizing communism or communist China.
[00:40:22.438 --> 00:40:24.759]  Or the film doesn't get released.
[00:40:24.759 --> 00:40:27.420]  That's okay to have them be the biggest owners of our fake debt.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.262]  That's okay to have them being leveraged to de-industrialize our country and use their people as total slaves.
[00:40:32.262 --> 00:40:35.704]  Chinese police will help patrol tourist destinations in Paris this summer.
[00:40:37.202 --> 00:40:41.065]  Yeah, I mean they can't get the French police to do anything.
[00:40:41.065 --> 00:40:50.532]  After a rise in muggings and attacks on Chinese tourists, it says the French government is bringing them in with full police power!
[00:40:50.532 --> 00:40:57.517]  And I'll never forget a News 8 Austin piece probably four or five years ago I saw with my own eyeballs and played here on air.
[00:40:57.517 --> 00:41:03.302]  They said Austin police are being sent to Tokyo in an exchange program so Tokyo police can come here and arrest people.
[00:41:04.102 --> 00:41:10.225]  And in future programs, with exchanges with police from other areas, they'll be here patrolling our streets.
[00:41:10.225 --> 00:41:12.487]  I mean, it's just a global police force.
[00:41:12.487 --> 00:41:18.970]  Standardized codes, standardized uniforms, standardized socialism, standardized domestic security force.
[00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:19.871]  This is the U.N.
[00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:21.792]  Army, is the CHICOMS.
[00:41:21.792 --> 00:41:23.833]  That's been the plan since the 60s.
[00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:26.755]  The CIA is a foreign banking cartel.
[00:41:27.395 --> 00:41:28.416]  Front group.
[00:41:28.416 --> 00:41:36.620]  They have been there day one putting Mao Zedong into power in 1949 with the master plan.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:49.686]  To take the hard-working smart Chinese workers, give them slave wages, shut up taxes worldwide where you can't operate in the West, move everything to China, consolidate power, de-industrialize, domesticate the general population, roll in your tyranny.
[00:41:51.826 --> 00:42:10.352]  If you want to watch the movie Rollerball to understand globalist Brzezinski nomenclature, David Rockefeller plans, they throw in your face the 1970s James Caan movie Rollerball and explain you have cities, no longer nations, and then the cities are part of a global government.
[00:42:10.352 --> 00:42:13.614]  Houston is energy.
[00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:16.094]  Tokyo is technology.
[00:42:16.094 --> 00:42:18.855]  Then you have another country that's military.
[00:42:18.855 --> 00:42:20.056]  City country, city states.
[00:42:21.107 --> 00:42:32.151]  Tokyo, Houston, London, Moscow, and then you're only allowed to produce that.
[00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:32.791]  What is the U.S.
[00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:34.591]  supposed to produce?
[00:42:34.591 --> 00:42:44.715]  Super high-tech weapons to be the top of the pyramid, to then export those to all the other groups to keep the arms race going, but then MIT admits that's actually been double-crossed.
[00:42:44.715 --> 00:42:46.595]  Insiders were always told America would be on top.
[00:42:46.595 --> 00:42:47.676]  It's all been transferred to China.
[00:42:47.676 --> 00:42:48.216]  It's over.
[00:42:48.216 --> 00:42:48.676]  Through Israel.
[00:42:49.915 --> 00:42:50.775]  It's already official.
[00:42:50.775 --> 00:42:52.236]  It's done.
[00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:53.376]  Officially done.
[00:42:53.376 --> 00:42:55.577]  You can look that up yourself.
[00:42:55.577 --> 00:42:56.678]  MIT says the U.S.
[00:42:56.678 --> 00:42:58.999]  has lost the arms superiority race forever.
[00:42:58.999 --> 00:43:00.279]  By design, it's over.
[00:43:00.279 --> 00:43:01.440]  And the industrial system.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.520]  See, that was the double-cross gun.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:03.840]  The U.S.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:12.484]  is slated to only supply, until robots are able to take over in the next 15 years, only to supply paramilitary forces.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:27.806]  They're only to supply soldiers because generally the European military system and military, uh, European stock soldiers are historically good soldiers.
[00:43:27.806 --> 00:43:28.907]  That's it.
[00:43:28.907 --> 00:43:33.269]  And of course, when I say European training, it doesn't matter if they're Hispanic, black, or whatever.
[00:43:33.269 --> 00:43:37.751]  They're put into a European training, uh, really Roman military system.
[00:43:38.732 --> 00:43:41.753]  Which even goes back to the Greeks, but this is the system.
[00:43:41.753 --> 00:43:46.235]  Humans are to be phased out, rendered down, de-industrialized, it's all official.
[00:43:46.235 --> 00:43:51.797]  So, the sooner you figure that out and read the Globalist's own documents, the sooner we can beat this.
[00:43:51.797 --> 00:43:55.698]  Or you're like, I got my iPad in the game, so what, you can't stop it, I'm gonna go party.
[00:43:57.318 --> 00:44:02.599]  Well, it doesn't matter if a majority of people either are too stupid or too weak to face the truth.
[00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:11.861]  A large minority of us want to have a future, and don't want to be erased, and don't want to be overwritten, and fundamentally aren't going to join with evil, and we're going to beat the globalists.
[00:44:11.861 --> 00:44:17.742]  Now, I'll get into the huge attack on free speech in the next hour after calls.
[00:44:17.742 --> 00:44:22.043]  We have Jordan Maxwell coming on, who I really think is a great mind and a really smart guy.
[00:44:22.043 --> 00:44:23.123]  He's had a lot of health problems.
[00:44:24.264 --> 00:44:29.888]  He's been scheduled three times in the last five years to be on the show, and has not ever made it.
[00:44:29.888 --> 00:44:33.611]  I hope today is the day he actually comes on.
[00:44:33.611 --> 00:44:41.257]  In the third hour, talk about symbolism in movies, and subliminal subversive programming, and basically predictive programming.
[00:44:41.257 --> 00:44:44.720]  So, we'll see if he ends up being on the show.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:50.885]  I'm not criticizing him, it's just that... trice bitten, trice shy.
[00:44:52.008 --> 00:44:55.592]  But we'll see what ends up happening.
[00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:58.255]  I really like the guy and I want to be supportive of him.
[00:44:58.255 --> 00:45:04.603]  I know he's been having a lot of health problems with him and his family and trying to take care of people and so he's been out of circulation, but that's coming up.
[00:45:05.523 --> 00:45:08.684]  I want to go to your phone calls on the Genesis Board.
[00:45:08.684 --> 00:45:14.466]  Also, my phone system, it looks like it's locked up in here, but we'll see what's happening with that.
[00:45:14.466 --> 00:45:21.288]  But the toll-free number to join us here on our phone system is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:45:21.288 --> 00:45:23.429]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:32.712]  And before I go any further, I want to play this clip of, speaking of the end of the internet, as we know it, I'm going to explain how they're going to do it, how we can stop it.
[00:45:32.712 --> 00:45:33.992]  The FCC head
[00:45:36.038 --> 00:45:48.182]  Who has been saying he's against what's happening, but he doesn't control the whole board, has warned that conservative media like Drudge Report will face regulation like PACS, the end of free speech.
[00:45:48.182 --> 00:45:49.022]  And you know what?
[00:45:49.022 --> 00:45:50.882]  This is where I draw my line.
[00:45:50.882 --> 00:46:01.905]  If I want to support Rand Paul or Ted Cruz, or if I want to support a Democratic Senator, it doesn't matter, I will support whoever I want with my free speech.
[00:46:01.905 --> 00:46:03.446]  And I'm not getting money from these people.
[00:46:04.873 --> 00:46:09.436]  If you had a Republican monopoly taking over and shutting things down, I would support the Democrats.
[00:46:09.436 --> 00:46:10.697]  Just out of survival.
[00:46:10.697 --> 00:46:12.278]  This is the end of free speech.
[00:46:12.278 --> 00:46:14.179]  And I will not be part of it.
[00:46:14.179 --> 00:46:16.601]  You'll have to send armed thugs here.
[00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:19.163]  I'm not going to shut up.
[00:46:19.163 --> 00:46:29.790]  And when they try to tell our AM and FM affiliates, if they get this through, that you can no longer carry Alex Jones or any other libertarian talk radio, it's time for the stations to keep it on the air.
[00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.431]  This is America, folks.
[00:46:31.431 --> 00:46:32.832]  And to go to court.
[00:46:32.832 --> 00:46:33.713]  To sue the government.
[00:46:34.701 --> 00:46:36.182]  They're not going to get away with this.
[00:46:36.182 --> 00:46:38.664]  And here's a headline.
[00:46:38.664 --> 00:46:45.150]  Dealing with this, FCC grabs for new regulatory power could go beyond broadband providers.
[00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:51.815]  The Hill, net neutrality's death could spark populist revolt with echoes of the Gilded Age.
[00:46:51.815 --> 00:46:54.938]  Washington coddles moneyed monopolistic internet barons.
[00:46:54.938 --> 00:46:55.639]  Yeah.
[00:46:55.639 --> 00:47:01.764]  Are we going to let a bunch of insiders take over the web for themselves and shut down their competition?
[00:47:01.764 --> 00:47:02.925]  And I don't just mean free speech.
[00:47:04.113 --> 00:47:10.978]  They're going to shut down your blog, your bookstore, your rare items shop, your online swap meet.
[00:47:10.978 --> 00:47:11.899]  It's all happening.
[00:47:11.899 --> 00:47:15.862]  That's why they're banning lemonade stands and bake sales nationwide with swap teams.
[00:47:15.862 --> 00:47:18.584]  They don't want you buying from farmers markets.
[00:47:18.584 --> 00:47:20.266]  They don't want you being a human.
[00:47:20.266 --> 00:47:22.027]  They don't want you having a garden.
[00:47:22.027 --> 00:47:27.131]  They want you on a giant plantation slash reservation.
[00:47:27.131 --> 00:47:31.054]  You want to see what you're going to live like, like Russell Means said before he died on the show?
[00:47:31.054 --> 00:47:32.055]  Look at the reservation.
[00:47:33.482 --> 00:47:34.403]  Russell Means.
[00:47:34.403 --> 00:47:36.284]  We're all on the reservation now.
[00:47:36.284 --> 00:47:36.825]  Search that.
[00:47:36.825 --> 00:47:37.706]  That's the name of the video.
[00:47:37.706 --> 00:47:40.688]  Hour-long, powerful interview.
[00:47:40.688 --> 00:47:43.811]  And he says up front, this is the plan.
[00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:45.212]  Who invented the reservation?
[00:47:45.212 --> 00:47:47.073]  The British.
[00:47:47.073 --> 00:47:49.115]  For the Irish and the Scots.
[00:47:49.115 --> 00:47:52.458]  Then they deployed it against the Indians, the Native Americans.
[00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:55.761]  Then it was deployed by Hitler against the Jews and others.
[00:47:55.761 --> 00:47:59.524]  Hitler wrote that he got it from the British model.
[00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:06.433]  And the concentration camps were modeled off of U.S.
[00:48:06.433 --> 00:48:08.534]  reservations.
[00:48:08.534 --> 00:48:11.116]  Look it up.
[00:48:11.116 --> 00:48:13.478]  That's the FEMA camps, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:13.478 --> 00:48:17.300]  They're gonna call them emergency relocation centers.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:23.064]  They're gonna have Friday night movies, folks, don't worry, but troublemakers will be taken away, though, to a lockdown area.
[00:48:23.064 --> 00:48:26.907]  And, you know, given over to mercenaries to be given a dirt nap.
[00:48:27.875 --> 00:48:28.916]  I mean, this is a plan.
[00:48:28.916 --> 00:48:30.017]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:48:30.017 --> 00:48:32.219]  They're going to execute this.
[00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:35.641]  Why do you think Drudge said months ago, have an exit plan?
[00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:37.603]  This is not a game.
[00:48:37.603 --> 00:48:40.745]  The rich people left a long time ago that weren't part of this.
[00:48:40.745 --> 00:48:50.814]  I told you that I ran into, in Wimberley, folks that live next door to one of John Wayne's sons, and talked to them, and they were leaving to Costa Rica.
[00:48:51.923 --> 00:48:59.124]  Four years ago, they were getting ready to sell out their stuff, their holdings, and leave because you, quote, wouldn't be able to get the money out after that.
[00:48:59.124 --> 00:49:01.645]  And sure enough, all that stuff happened.
[00:49:01.645 --> 00:49:04.586]  Outside of law, they just did it.
[00:49:04.586 --> 00:49:07.926]  You're after tax money.
[00:49:07.926 --> 00:49:14.928]  They were going to take money John Wayne made in the 40s and 50s and 60s that he'd already paid taxes on over and over again, and his kids had paid taxes on.
[00:49:14.928 --> 00:49:18.849]  They were going to take that.
[00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:20.329]  And John Wayne, of course, married
[00:49:21.544 --> 00:49:24.248]  You know, a Latin American woman, so his kids speak Spanish.
[00:49:24.248 --> 00:49:29.915]  The whole point is, is they're just getting out of this country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:29.915 --> 00:49:32.879]  So, that's what's going on in this country.
[00:49:32.879 --> 00:49:35.062]  I mean, classical tyranny is being set up.
[00:49:35.947 --> 00:49:45.355]  We're going to go to break and come back with Jay, Jack, Lawrence, Albert, Eugene, and then on our phone system, James, David, Andrea, and Terry, and I'm just going to give you one minute and go to the next person.
[00:49:45.355 --> 00:49:57.086]  We'll take calls to the bottom of the next hour, and then I will summon my psychological and mental repertoire and try to give you a proper analysis of the total internet takeover and how they're going to hit us.
[00:49:57.086 --> 00:50:00.629]  And the fact that they're moving forward with this shows you they're getting ready to move.
[00:50:00.629 --> 00:50:01.770]  Everything's going to start clicking.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:09.446]  But it's so immoral, so evil, we've got a good chance to have this boomerang around and beat them.
[00:50:09.446 --> 00:50:10.827]  But this is so incredible.
[00:50:10.827 --> 00:50:13.689]  By the way, briefly, please support the broadcast.
[00:50:13.689 --> 00:50:14.730]  Don't take it for granted.

[00:52:28.362 --> 00:52:37.668]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:52:37.668 --> 00:52:38.448]  This capitalism?
[00:52:38.448 --> 00:52:44.612]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[00:52:50.636 --> 00:52:50.977]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:52:50.977 --> 00:52:51.237]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:52:58.061 --> 00:53:00.883]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:53:00.883 --> 00:53:06.006]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:53:06.006 --> 00:53:14.132]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:53:14.132 --> 00:53:18.654]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:53:18.654 --> 00:53:22.457]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:53:22.617 --> 00:53:28.562]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:53:28.562 --> 00:53:31.744]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:53:31.744 --> 00:53:37.108]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:53:37.108 --> 00:53:45.294]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:53:45.294 --> 00:53:45.615]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:53:45.615 --> 00:53:46.095]  Do business
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.441]  with someone who shares your values.
[00:53:54.441 --> 00:53:57.122]  MyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[00:54:23.007 --> 00:54:24.688]  There is a war.
[00:54:24.688 --> 00:54:26.449]  It's happening now.
[00:54:26.449 --> 00:54:28.931]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:54:28.931 --> 00:54:31.493]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:54:31.493 --> 00:54:33.414]  We are the resistance.
[00:54:33.414 --> 00:54:36.717]  We are the Infowar.
[00:54:36.717 --> 00:54:49.806]  By the way, we've got something really special with Rowdy Piper, who's been a guest on the broadcast of They Live, coming up at the bottom of the third hour in the middle of the Jordan Maxwell interview that's coming up.
[00:54:51.243 --> 00:55:02.072]  But getting back to the end of the last segment before I go to your calls, where I said fund us, we don't force you to give money to MSNBC and all the globalist outlets, the state-run media.
[00:55:02.072 --> 00:55:05.394]  You better fund and support and promote.
[00:55:05.394 --> 00:55:10.418]  I know you know that, but I mean now's the time to act like a chicken with your head cut off.
[00:55:10.418 --> 00:55:20.106]  Because if I get major capital, I will throw it against the enemy and I'll have more to work with and not have to sit there and be more judicious and take my time about things.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.024]  I mean, it's literally energized me.
[00:55:24.024 --> 00:55:27.009]  And we will take it to the enemy savagely, as we've already done.
[00:55:27.009 --> 00:55:32.918]  We will literally weaponize this operation against the globalists in the Infowar.
[00:55:32.918 --> 00:55:34.060]  We've already done it.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.803]  But I'm all in.
[00:55:35.803 --> 00:55:36.284]  I'm committed.
[00:55:37.575 --> 00:55:40.298]  And you need to promote internet freedom, period.
[00:55:40.298 --> 00:55:45.064]  Because they're going to kill the free speech first, then they're going after your commerce.
[00:55:45.064 --> 00:55:46.365]  That's what they really want to shut down.
[00:55:46.365 --> 00:55:47.887]  That's how they control everybody.
[00:55:47.887 --> 00:55:48.908]  Globally, it's through the money.
[00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:50.610]  Look at the sanctions on Russia.
[00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:52.072]  This is what the technocracy is about.
[00:55:52.072 --> 00:55:54.635]  This is a very diabolical plan.
[00:55:54.635 --> 00:55:55.496]  It's a new kind of war.
[00:55:57.347 --> 00:56:04.152]  Jay, Jack, Lance, Albert, Eugene, James, Andrea, Terry, Rich, I'm going to go to all of you.
[00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:07.114]  Let's go to about two or three calls right now before this segment ends.
[00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:10.456]  Jay, you're on the air, and where are you calling from?
[00:56:10.456 --> 00:56:14.259]  I'm calling from Wyoming.
[00:56:14.259 --> 00:56:17.721]  I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[00:56:17.721 --> 00:56:23.665]  I've done research on stuff that you have presented, and I believe you.
[00:56:23.665 --> 00:56:25.887]  I believe what you're telling me is the truth.
[00:56:26.956 --> 00:56:34.622]  Um, the stuff that's, you know, the questions I have, you know, the more you learn, the more questions you should be asking.
[00:56:34.622 --> 00:56:55.678]  And, uh, you know, with movies like The Stand, you know, where just millions of people die from a disease, and, you know, the movie like, you know, the new Red Dawn movie, where it's... No, when I read The Stand, when I read The Stand, I was probably 25, and by Stephen King, and it's like an allegory of what's going on.
[00:56:57.728 --> 00:56:58.889]  Yeah.
[00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:15.721]  Um, now the new Red Dawn movie, you know, depicts Obama, you know, totally betraying the people and just allowing, you know, the, uh, the Koreans to come in, you know, and they bomb out of the country.
[00:57:15.721 --> 00:57:25.888]  Well, again, it was going to be China, but China so controls us, proving the Red Dawn movie politically, that they took two years to reshoot it.
[00:57:25.888 --> 00:57:26.168]  Oh, wow.
[00:57:28.028 --> 00:57:30.470]  See what I'm talking about?
[00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:31.691]  See what I'm talking about?
[00:57:31.691 --> 00:57:36.715]  Chinese troops now occupying Paris.
[00:57:36.715 --> 00:57:40.879]  AFP, a paramilitary police now occupying Paris.
[00:57:40.879 --> 00:57:42.120]  This is globalism.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:47.144]  Foreign, paramilitary in your cities.
[00:57:47.144 --> 00:57:51.868]  My wife wants to know the Obamacare and the death panels.
[00:57:54.051 --> 00:57:58.753]  It sets up federal boards that control the care people can get and cuts back the care.
[00:57:58.753 --> 00:58:01.394]  Oh, you're 65, you don't need eye surgery.
[00:58:01.394 --> 00:58:03.215]  Oh, you're a smoker, you don't get lung surgery.
[00:58:03.215 --> 00:58:05.035]  Oh, your knee's hurt, here's a cane.
[00:58:05.035 --> 00:58:09.297]  It's basic British model, but even worse.
[00:58:09.297 --> 00:58:11.018]  Yeah, and I'm seeing that.
[00:58:11.018 --> 00:58:12.358]  I'm seeing that.
[00:58:12.358 --> 00:58:21.562]  I just had to quit my job at the VA here in town because of the fact that I can see these veterans being withheld
[00:58:22.809 --> 00:58:23.590]  Oh, it's on record.
[00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:24.731]  They put them on death list.
[00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:25.811]  It's a death panel.
[00:58:25.811 --> 00:58:26.872]  It's not just in Phoenix.
[00:58:26.872 --> 00:58:29.433]  All over the country, they just... It's well known.
[00:58:29.433 --> 00:58:31.115]  They just say, stop giving treatment to this person.
[00:58:31.115 --> 00:58:32.095]  Let them die.
[00:58:32.095 --> 00:58:36.638]  And then they tie them down, and then flies crawl up their nose, lay eggs in their sinus, and eats their brain.
[00:58:36.638 --> 00:58:37.739]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:37.739 --> 00:58:39.020]  I'm not joking about that either, folks.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.941]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:58:40.941 --> 00:58:43.542]  They call it maggoting.
[00:58:43.542 --> 00:58:45.704]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.727 --> 00:58:53.770]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:58.153]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:58:58.153 --> 00:59:01.816]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:59:01.816 --> 00:59:04.838]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:59:04.838 --> 00:59:12.184]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:59:12.424 --> 00:59:16.328]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:59:16.328 --> 00:59:20.753]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:59:20.753 --> 00:59:26.719]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:59:26.719 --> 00:59:30.803]  Fluoride, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:59:30.803 --> 00:59:33.406]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:59:33.406 --> 00:59:34.727]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:59:34.887 --> 00:59:36.248]  It's time to take action.
[00:59:36.248 --> 00:59:38.090]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:54.988]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.988 --> 00:59:57.750]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.485 --> 01:00:09.308]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.308 --> 01:00:10.889]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:12.450]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:16.633]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.633 --> 01:00:21.316]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.316 --> 01:00:24.018]  I'm going right back to your phone calls, bottom of the hour.
[01:00:24.018 --> 01:00:25.219]  It's official.
[01:00:25.219 --> 01:00:29.002]  They're going to shut off Libertarian and Conservative talk radio, print media.
[01:00:30.518 --> 01:00:33.159]  Internet FCC under Obama.
[01:00:33.159 --> 01:00:34.940]  They're gonna try it.
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:35.881]  Gonna get into that.
[01:00:35.881 --> 01:00:39.723]  Yellen's announcing what could be more QE unlimited.
[01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:42.024]  Guess that's why it's unlimited.
[01:00:42.024 --> 01:00:44.486]  And by the way, I said this probably ten times yesterday.
[01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:45.966]  I don't even have the crew to go find it.
[01:00:45.966 --> 01:00:47.687]  You heard it.
[01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.929]  Maybe somebody can find it.
[01:00:49.929 --> 01:00:53.350]  Watching this later on YouTube and go back and find yesterday's show.
[01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:59.754]  I said that I believed, but I had to say I believed, that the supposed abortion clinic
[01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:26.327]  woman who was trying to find the article they just gave it to me here it is that was saying how wonderful it was it was like giving birth and she loves her baby in the photo of it that that it was acting and it's now been confirmed that she is an actress and I think if you research further she was funded by a large foundation probably Rockefeller Brothers or Planned Parenthood
[01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.360]  But there's the headline, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.922]  It's since scrolled off into the news archive.
[01:01:33.922 --> 01:01:35.784]  Stuff that comes out at night, barely gets read.
[01:01:35.784 --> 01:01:39.767]  It's almost like seeds falling on the rock.
[01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:47.234]  Star of YouTube abortion video is a horror movie actress, Emily Letts, featured in slasher films about children being slaughtered.
[01:01:47.234 --> 01:01:49.416]  Isn't that precious?
[01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:52.879]  And it's a promotion of abortions and how beautiful they are.
[01:01:54.116 --> 01:01:56.778]  I'm in Washington State around Goldendale, Alex.
[01:02:23.985 --> 01:02:24.965]  All right.
[01:02:24.965 --> 01:02:31.208]  Well, how are things going over there in FEMA Region 10?
[01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:36.010]  They're now picking up the core from the plutonium in Europe.
[01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:38.771]  So we now know the core was blown sky high.
[01:02:38.771 --> 01:02:40.152]  I think everybody's enjoying the radiation.
[01:02:40.152 --> 01:02:40.572]  What about you?
[01:02:41.531 --> 01:02:42.431]  Oh, I'd listen to him.
[01:02:42.431 --> 01:02:44.993]  If that wasn't the Nathan Ida, I'd probably be dead already.
[01:02:44.993 --> 01:02:48.294]  But anyway, I think that a HAARP weapon is actually what caused that.
[01:02:48.294 --> 01:02:51.916]  Can you look at the epicenter of the quake where the tsunami was created?
[01:02:51.916 --> 01:02:56.558]  I remember back in the 70s when there was a nuclear waste dump that was dumped down there in that trash.
[01:02:56.558 --> 01:02:58.259]  Do you remember that, Alex?
[01:02:58.259 --> 01:02:58.859]  Yes, I do.
[01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:05.242]  And you should be thankful because the Ukrainian government is duly elected, even though it isn't.
[01:03:05.242 --> 01:03:07.243]  And Al Gore invented the Internet.
[01:03:08.157 --> 01:03:10.778]  Yeah, just like raising their debt doesn't raise their debt.
[01:03:10.778 --> 01:03:12.658]  I mean, I tried to call my credit card company.
[01:03:12.658 --> 01:03:13.778]  They told me that I was laughing.
[01:03:13.778 --> 01:03:15.499]  I was crazy.
[01:03:15.499 --> 01:03:19.940]  Yeah, like, hey, I'm going to raise my amount that I owe you, but I won't owe that money, right?
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.080]  They're like, oh, yes.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.700]  Two plus two equals whatever we want.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.460]  Exactly.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:30.162]  And as far as... Let me ask you a question, though, because I can counter you saying that two plus two equals four.
[01:03:30.162 --> 01:03:35.923]  You're being racist to say Obama is lying about raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise our debt.
[01:03:37.099 --> 01:03:45.164]  Well, sir, if criticizing my government and standing up for my constitution is racist, then I'll be glad to be one, sir.
[01:03:45.164 --> 01:03:50.208]  Well, then just anything else racist?
[01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:55.751]  Well, I believe that what's going on in Russia is a show game.
[01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:56.432]  That's all it is.
[01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.893]  We've been training with Russian troops for years.
[01:03:58.893 --> 01:04:00.855]  We've been training with Chinese troops for years.
[01:04:00.855 --> 01:04:03.797]  This is just a smokescreen.
[01:04:03.797 --> 01:04:04.437]  It's a distraction.
[01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:07.210]  Well, I agree with the Chinese.
[01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:11.252]  It's over here to distract you from this while they're doing this over here in the backstretch.
[01:04:11.252 --> 01:04:13.194]  But the globalists are like bank robbers.
[01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:14.674]  They don't all trust each other.
[01:04:14.674 --> 01:04:18.156]  Just because they'll rob a bank together doesn't mean that they won't stab each other in the back.
[01:04:18.156 --> 01:04:21.618]  So there's some real fishers there in the power blocks.
[01:04:21.618 --> 01:04:26.481]  But none of them want to stop the growth of world government because they all think they're going to run it.
[01:04:29.281 --> 01:04:29.861]  Very true.
[01:04:29.861 --> 01:04:30.442]  Great points.
[01:04:30.442 --> 01:04:31.582]  All right.
[01:04:31.582 --> 01:04:40.488]  We're going to talk to Jack, Lance, Eugene, then we're going to go to James, Andrea, Terry, Rich and others.
[01:04:40.488 --> 01:04:40.908]  Stay there.
[01:04:40.908 --> 01:04:41.888]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:04:41.888 --> 01:04:43.209]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:04:43.209 --> 01:04:51.134]  Then, FCC grab for new regulatory power to go beyond broadband providers and spark a nationwide revolt.
[01:04:51.134 --> 01:04:54.536]  The Hill and others admit it's a robber baron power grab.
[01:04:54.536 --> 01:04:58.178]  I like the word robber baron being brought back into common parlance.
[01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:10.313]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:10.313 --> 01:05:12.373]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:12.373 --> 01:05:13.273]  Fluoride!
[01:05:13.273 --> 01:05:15.194]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:15.194 --> 01:05:21.755]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:26.696]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:05:26.696 --> 01:05:28.357]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ
[01:05:29.537 --> 01:05:29.937]  We're good.
[01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.582]  I take it every day.
[01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:59.546]  That's Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:05:59.546 --> 01:06:06.810]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:09.191]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:14.535]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:06:14.535 --> 01:06:19.638]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:06:19.778 --> 01:06:23.161]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:06:23.161 --> 01:06:27.284]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:31.688]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:42.036]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:06:42.036 --> 01:06:44.598]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:06:44.798 --> 01:06:46.500]  And manufactured in the USA.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:53.129]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:06:53.129 --> 01:06:57.115]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.758 --> 01:07:08.841]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:08.841 --> 01:07:17.244]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:17.244 --> 01:07:22.126]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:22.126 --> 01:07:28.268]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars Life
[01:07:28.268 --> 01:07:28.929]  I don't think so.
[01:07:47.586 --> 01:07:50.973]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:50.973 --> 01:07:52.877]  You will be supporting a free press.
[01:07:52.877 --> 01:07:57.285]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:57.285 --> 01:07:58.968]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[01:08:09.884 --> 01:08:15.968]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:08:15.968 --> 01:08:20.950]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:25.813]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[01:08:25.813 --> 01:08:27.794]  It's not about food.
[01:08:27.794 --> 01:08:30.416]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:08:37.059 --> 01:08:39.200]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.823]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:08:43.823 --> 01:09:00.193]  It was Benjamin Franklin that famously said during the Revolutionary War when it was all kicking off in 1776, just days before July 4th Declaration was finished, that we shall all hang together or hang separate.
[01:09:00.193 --> 01:09:05.476]  And that means we hang together as men and women for liberty or we will be hung by our neck until dead separately.
[01:09:06.462 --> 01:09:11.286]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails.
[01:09:11.286 --> 01:09:23.415]  And those that cried, appease, appease, are killed by those they tried to please.
[01:09:23.415 --> 01:09:32.781]  And those that cried, appease, appease, are killed by those they tried to please.
[01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:34.623]  That's also a refrain from that period.
[01:09:35.987 --> 01:09:38.308]  No man escapes when freedom fails.
[01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:41.029]  The best men rot in filthy jails.
[01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:45.590]  And those who cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:47.091]  Another variant of it.
[01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:48.551]  Anonymous from the 1770s.
[01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:53.613]  I'm going to read that again for everybody because it says it all.
[01:09:53.613 --> 01:09:59.675]  They had such great command of the language back then that I can't even read a newspaper from the time and understand it.
[01:09:59.675 --> 01:10:00.876]  No man escapes
[01:10:01.874 --> 01:10:03.176]  You hear that?
[01:10:03.176 --> 01:10:04.598]  No man escapes!
[01:10:04.598 --> 01:10:07.041]  You bring in tyranny, it's bad for everybody.
[01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:10.085]  Even those that run it, it's a prison.
[01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:12.548]  No man escapes when freedom fails.
[01:10:13.624 --> 01:10:16.987]  No man escapes when freedom fails.
[01:10:16.987 --> 01:10:21.591]  The best men rot in filthy jails.
[01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:31.499]  And those who cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[01:10:31.499 --> 01:10:32.460]  And that says everything.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:39.826]  Historically, they kill the traitors, they lock up the patriots, or kick you out of the country.
[01:10:41.138 --> 01:10:44.599]  The evil admires those of us that fight for freedom.
[01:10:44.599 --> 01:10:46.879]  They admire our purity.
[01:10:46.879 --> 01:10:49.099]  They admire our strength, our courage.
[01:10:49.099 --> 01:10:52.680]  They see us like a wild grizzly bear in the forest.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:58.881]  That's how a lot of history books I've read, and I've also seen it likened, that globalists marvel after the resistance.
[01:10:58.881 --> 01:10:59.861]  And H.G.
[01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:08.303]  Wells called the resistance to the New World Order beautiful and gallant people, but nevertheless would have to be killed before the New World Order could be achieved.
[01:11:08.303 --> 01:11:10.003]  In fact, pull up the quote.
[01:11:11.772 --> 01:11:13.652]  A bunch of other people made similar quotes.
[01:11:13.652 --> 01:11:25.315]  The New World Order, the head of the CFR said back in the 70s, the New World Order will have to be paid for with money as well as blood before a planetary regime is brought in.
[01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:32.157]  Everyone will take a pledged elucifer or be killed under the new planetary system of the New World Order.
[01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:35.078]  I'm giving you actual quotes right now.
[01:11:35.078 --> 01:11:38.339]  You will take a luciferian initiation or you will be killed.
[01:11:39.386 --> 01:11:41.608]  Council on Foreign Relations meeting.
[01:11:41.608 --> 01:11:42.608]  Congressional record.
[01:11:42.608 --> 01:11:43.970]  I mean, these are all real quotes.
[01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:44.890]  I forget who gave the quotes.
[01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:45.871]  I know it was CFR.
[01:11:45.871 --> 01:11:48.393]  Remember, she can pull it up.
[01:11:48.393 --> 01:11:48.793]  Type it.
[01:11:48.793 --> 01:11:51.375]  Everyone will take a Luciferian initiative.
[01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:54.177]  I think that was the head of the CFR's planetary initiative.
[01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:57.260]  Arthur something.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:02.544]  We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood as well as in words and money.
[01:12:02.544 --> 01:12:04.285]  Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
[01:12:04.285 --> 01:12:05.206]  in Foreign Affairs.
[01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:09.493]  Council on Foreign Relations publication, 1995.
[01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:15.239]  Yeah, and then, who was it?
[01:12:15.239 --> 01:12:21.245]  Type in, you will take a Luciferian pledge to the New World Order, or be killed.
[01:12:21.245 --> 01:12:26.290]  No one will enter the New World Order unless they've taken a Luciferian pledge, is the quote.
[01:12:26.290 --> 01:12:30.314]  Then he goes on to say, I don't think it was Schlesinger, it was somebody else, or we will kill you!
[01:12:31.499 --> 01:12:33.181]  The guys are actually finding these quotes right now.
[01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:38.288]  I actually own, because a listener sent it to me, the 1995 Foreign Affairs.
[01:12:38.288 --> 01:12:42.533]  It's like a book that comes out every two months at the bookstore, in the magazine rack.
[01:12:42.533 --> 01:12:45.617]  I mean, imagine that!
[01:12:45.617 --> 01:12:47.480]  And this is who they are.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.783]  I can play Walter Cronkite saying the same thing if you'd like me to.
[01:12:52.887 --> 01:12:55.528]  And by the way, Walter Cronkite believed in what he was doing.
[01:12:55.528 --> 01:12:58.509]  Now, why is Al Gore coming out and saying he invented the Internet?
[01:12:58.509 --> 01:13:00.570]  Why is Obama saying you didn't build your business?
[01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:03.811]  Why is Obama saying that the Ukrainian government's elected when everybody knows it isn't?
[01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:06.212]  Well, because everybody doesn't know.
[01:13:06.212 --> 01:13:09.753]  The general public thinks Ukraine is in Australia.
[01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:13.355]  The general public can't find their big rear end with both of their hands.
[01:13:16.257 --> 01:13:24.260]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls right now, but again, now that we're talking about 2 plus 2 equals 5, and I'm about to tweet that image out at real Alex Jones in minutes.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:29.202]  We actually had the crew make the image of the new American flag under Obama that I think says it all.
[01:13:29.202 --> 01:13:32.083]  Before we do that, let's play Lord
[01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:39.420]  Gore, because we're coming up after calls, we're going to get into this, saying he invented the Internet.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.040]  More lies.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.140]  Here it is.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:48.164]  During my service in the United States of Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.
[01:13:48.164 --> 01:13:55.708]  I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic
[01:13:55.828 --> 01:13:59.549]  The inventors of the Internet come from universities in England and the U.S.
[01:13:59.549 --> 01:14:01.050]  There's about five men.
[01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:02.210]  They're all very well known.
[01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.050]  They all have patents.
[01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:05.291]  They've all made hundreds of millions off of it.
[01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:13.453]  It was developed in the 60s and 70s and was an inter-university governmental computer system to survive nuclear war, paid for by DARPA.
[01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:15.254]  That's on record, Gore.
[01:14:15.254 --> 01:14:18.955]  Gore was in college when the Internet was invented.
[01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:21.676]  He voted as a senator on a program
[01:14:22.714 --> 01:14:25.255]  to put government regulation into it.
[01:14:25.255 --> 01:14:27.775]  So you squatted on it and claimed it was yours.
[01:14:27.775 --> 01:14:37.238]  It'd be like if somebody had a 14-year-old son, you randomly walked up and said, you know, gave him a ball cap and said, and the kid put the ball cap on, he went, I'm your daddy now.
[01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:39.399]  I gave birth to you.
[01:14:39.399 --> 01:14:40.859]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:14:40.859 --> 01:14:44.520]  Should I play Obama saying the Ukrainians are an elected government?
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.220]  Just, just, no, no, no.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:51.542]  Or should I play him saying that, I mean, there's so many.
[01:14:52.523 --> 01:14:54.204]  That raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise the debt?
[01:14:54.204 --> 01:14:55.325]  No, no, no.
[01:14:55.325 --> 01:14:56.005]  I guess it's true.
[01:14:56.005 --> 01:14:58.246]  Two plus two does equal five.
[01:14:58.246 --> 01:14:59.487]  I don't want to be racist.
[01:14:59.487 --> 01:15:02.989]  Jack in Manitoba.
[01:15:02.989 --> 01:15:07.952]  Okay, so give us your... Jack, give us your take on that.
[01:15:07.952 --> 01:15:15.476]  Oh, well, I just want to say I've been a libertarian since, you know, Branch Davidian massacre, Oklahoma City.
[01:15:16.349 --> 01:15:17.690]  I'm from Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:20.592]  It's not the United States, but it's, you know, center of North America.
[01:15:20.592 --> 01:15:22.773]  You probably know about it because of the 97th flood of the century.
[01:15:22.773 --> 01:15:25.935]  I personally think that was a man-made disaster myself.
[01:15:25.935 --> 01:15:27.736]  Muddy waters.
[01:15:27.736 --> 01:15:30.457]  Now, they use it for a gun confiscation drill.
[01:15:30.457 --> 01:15:31.578]  Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.
[01:15:31.578 --> 01:15:32.778]  I would not be surprised.
[01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:36.280]  I'm sure if you drained the rivers, you'd find all kinds of things.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:36.781]  But anyways...
[01:15:37.563 --> 01:15:44.509]  You know, I just want to say I totally agree with you about Russia and Ukraine, about the internet and what Obama has said.
[01:15:44.509 --> 01:15:46.250]  I'm with you all the way on that.
[01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:46.911]  You're not alone.
[01:15:46.911 --> 01:15:48.032]  America's not alone.
[01:15:48.032 --> 01:15:50.634]  You've got a lot of support up here in Canada.
[01:15:50.634 --> 01:15:56.338]  You know, going back to Oklahoma City, Branch Davidian massacre, Janet Reno is a war criminal, ATF is a Gestapo.
[01:15:56.338 --> 01:15:58.841]  No, I understand, but listen, I appreciate that.
[01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:05.206]  The calls I'm taking are, what do you think about what's happening in Russia and also the attacks on free speech?
[01:16:06.693 --> 01:16:08.454]  Well, it's the First Amendment.
[01:16:08.454 --> 01:16:14.097]  Well, in Canada it's a bit different, but First Amendment is, you know, that is the most important amendment.
[01:16:14.097 --> 01:16:16.979]  Oh, yeah, they're really trashing your free speech up there.
[01:16:16.979 --> 01:16:17.819]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:16:17.819 --> 01:16:20.681]  It's, like, this government's got to go.
[01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:21.801]  You know, they say conservative.
[01:16:21.801 --> 01:16:24.563]  I think it's more like con-servative, you know.
[01:16:24.563 --> 01:16:27.604]  And, you know, they're not the real deal.
[01:16:27.604 --> 01:16:35.329]  But going back to Russia, I believe it's, you know, like Kiev government is mostly like, it's a fascist government.
[01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:35.809]  Like, there are
[01:16:36.565 --> 01:16:40.526]  Super right-wing, the so-supposed right-wing fascists in there.
[01:16:40.526 --> 01:16:44.747]  Well, they're actual Nazis, but because they're with Soros, it's okay.
[01:16:44.747 --> 01:16:46.448]  I mean, Soros is back at home.
[01:16:46.448 --> 01:16:48.228]  He was a Nazi collaborator.
[01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:49.869]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:16:49.869 --> 01:16:52.089]  But, you know, exactly, absolutely right.
[01:16:52.089 --> 01:16:57.251]  And, you know, look what you did in 2000 with Bohemian Grove, you know.
[01:16:58.095 --> 01:17:06.762]  And then Bill de Burger, 2006, you came to our country and they took your passport, they took your camera and bags.
[01:17:06.762 --> 01:17:17.110]  And if it wasn't for the media having an instinct to protect other media and showing up, they were going to fly me back or put me in a jail in Toronto.
[01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:18.311]  Great points, appreciate your call.
[01:17:18.311 --> 01:17:19.632]  I'm going to try to move quick here.
[01:17:19.632 --> 01:17:21.653]  Thank you so much from Canada, Jack.
[01:17:21.653 --> 01:17:23.855]  Eugene in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:17:24.824 --> 01:17:26.125]  Good afternoon, Alex Jones.
[01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:27.385]  I am a Prison Planet member.
[01:17:27.385 --> 01:17:27.946]  Thank you.
[01:17:27.946 --> 01:17:33.529]  I love the book Strategic Relocation, which brings me to Cole Skousen.
[01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:46.936]  I actually live close by Cleon Skousen, and I would love to get his take and interview him about how he thinks today lines up with what he wrote in 19... Well, he may... I know they have a lot of sons and people, but the original Cleon Skousen's dead.
[01:17:46.936 --> 01:17:48.997]  So you may be talking about one of his sons.
[01:17:50.327 --> 01:17:51.288]  Okay.
[01:17:51.288 --> 01:17:56.350]  And I would love to see what anybody in the family thinks about how things line up in Russia today.
[01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:59.112]  Oh, I would love to interview Cleon Skousen.
[01:17:59.112 --> 01:17:59.832]  That'd be amazing.
[01:17:59.832 --> 01:18:01.453]  The original Cleon Skousen.
[01:18:01.453 --> 01:18:03.814]  But I guess you live near some of his family.
[01:18:03.814 --> 01:18:06.295]  What do you think about what's happening in Russia?
[01:18:06.295 --> 01:18:07.096]  Oh, it's amazing.
[01:18:07.096 --> 01:18:09.857]  No amount of lives are worth what
[01:18:10.473 --> 01:18:12.354]  They want to create with the New World Order.
[01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.775]  No amount of life lost.
[01:18:13.775 --> 01:18:15.015]  It's not worth it.
[01:18:15.015 --> 01:18:21.158]  And I think there's so many wonderful people in this world, and humanity has so much going for it, that we can turn the tide.
[01:18:21.158 --> 01:18:23.359]  And we are turning the tide.
[01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:27.581]  Well, the only way the globalists can be in control is because they're ruthless, they lie, they deceive.
[01:18:27.581 --> 01:18:29.642]  But that system's coming to an end.
[01:18:29.642 --> 01:18:30.603]  And it's so destructive.
[01:18:30.603 --> 01:18:31.983]  Thank you for the call, Eugene.
[01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:34.204]  Lance, in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:18:34.204 --> 01:18:36.886]  Then we're going to go to James, George, Andrea, Rich, and others.
[01:18:36.886 --> 01:18:37.186]  Go ahead.
[01:18:38.712 --> 01:18:40.815]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you.
[01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:42.857]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:18:42.857 --> 01:18:44.599]  Worldwide transmission on this planet.
[01:18:44.599 --> 01:18:49.905]  Hey, listen, I want to put it out there to everybody to exercise their rights.
[01:18:49.905 --> 01:18:56.874]  I carry open here in Washington State, and most of the police officers, they really like it.
[01:18:58.419 --> 01:19:02.261]  You can walk around with it loaded, locked and loaded, ready to go, ready to rock and roll up here.
[01:19:02.261 --> 01:19:02.761]  Yeah, I know.
[01:19:02.761 --> 01:19:05.182]  Most police are pro-gun.
[01:19:05.182 --> 01:19:08.124]  I've seen national polls of about 98%.
[01:19:08.124 --> 01:19:11.806]  So, you know, the media uses bad examples of police.
[01:19:12.864 --> 01:19:17.466]  To try to make us see them as an enemy so that they will then see the government as their ally.
[01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:19.387]  We need to own the police.
[01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:26.611]  And by owning it, we need to own that we're Americans and own the fact that we need to take our communities back.
[01:19:26.611 --> 01:19:28.972]  I'm going to hold you over because you called in.
[01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:31.133]  By exercising our rights, absolutely.
[01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:35.576]  Absolutely, I mean that's why we've got to exercise the free speech, the second amendment, use it or lose it.
[01:19:35.576 --> 01:19:37.757]  What else would you like to add?
[01:19:37.757 --> 01:19:40.058]  I want to give a shout out to my terrorist friend Spiro.
[01:19:40.905 --> 01:19:42.607]  Thanks for turning me on to you.
[01:19:42.607 --> 01:19:48.355]  You know, back in the 70s, I did book reports when I was in school about the Russian military.
[01:19:48.355 --> 01:19:49.216]  I want to hear about this.
[01:19:49.216 --> 01:19:49.596]  Stay there.
[01:19:49.596 --> 01:19:51.018]  I don't want to shortchange you.
[01:19:51.018 --> 01:19:54.602]  So we're going to come back with Lance, then we're going to go to our phone system.
[01:19:54.602 --> 01:19:55.524]  Stay with us.
[01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:56.625]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:56.665]  800-259-9231.

[01:21:59.474 --> 01:22:06.158]  What I'm about to tell you is based on information obtained from a little-known government document called FT-900.
[01:22:06.158 --> 01:22:16.283]  This bombshell government document contains evidence of a political scandal that will destroy Obama's political career and ruin the retirement of millions of unprepared Americans.
[01:22:16.283 --> 01:22:28.170]  I've just posted a video at www.ObamaSecret.com that not only analyzes the contents of this document, but it walks you through the exact timeline of how and when this scandal is set to unfold.
[01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:36.617]  This imminent scandal will trigger a virtually unstoppable chain of events that will swipe trillions off markets and retirement accounts everywhere.
[01:22:36.617 --> 01:22:42.802]  This event will, however, also trigger what promises to be the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our nation.
[01:22:42.802 --> 01:22:48.247]  But you only have a few weeks left to take all the necessary steps to protect yourself and your family.
[01:22:48.607 --> 01:22:53.370]  Visit www.obamasecret.com to view my newly released video.
[01:23:04.898 --> 01:23:06.639]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:06.639 --> 01:23:14.761]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:14.761 --> 01:23:19.282]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:23:19.282 --> 01:23:23.263]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:23.263 --> 01:23:28.945]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:29.185 --> 01:23:32.367]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:32.367 --> 01:23:37.731]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:37.731 --> 01:23:45.917]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:24:16.533 --> 01:24:17.033]  I think so.
[01:24:46.084 --> 01:24:48.346]  Yeah, it's a love train.
[01:24:48.346 --> 01:24:53.350]  Russia is announcing that they don't want any of the Ukrainian cities to vote to join with Russia.
[01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:58.675]  They've only been part of Russia for hundreds of years.
[01:24:58.675 --> 01:25:00.617]  And they're announcing they're pulling troops back from their border.
[01:25:00.617 --> 01:25:04.581]  NATO will mass more troops, probably start attacking the Russian border.
[01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:07.524]  I mean, if they follow their past operations.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:18.625]  They're going to attack us and our bank accounts and attack our families and shut off all of our power plants and just put everybody on welfare and just dominate everybody, and that's what they did.
[01:25:18.625 --> 01:25:20.786]  Just total criminal operation.
[01:25:20.786 --> 01:25:24.487]  Let's now go back to Lance in Washington.
[01:25:24.487 --> 01:25:28.309]  You were talking about book reports in the 70s dealing with the Russia situation.
[01:25:28.309 --> 01:25:29.670]  Go ahead.
[01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:36.973]  Well, I don't know if it's with the Russia situation now, but one of the seal handbooks stated in there the only way to take over the United States would be to
[01:25:37.577 --> 01:25:44.399]  Yeah, no, I wasn't saying you were talking about the Russian situation now.
[01:25:44.399 --> 01:25:46.640]  I was saying you were talking about that in context with it.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.121]  But it isn't Russians that did this.
[01:25:58.524 --> 01:25:59.725]  It's the globalist.
[01:25:59.725 --> 01:26:03.947]  Our criminal elite that run America put Lenin in power in 1917.
[01:26:03.947 --> 01:26:06.109]  No, no, no.
[01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:07.089]  I totally agree.
[01:26:07.089 --> 01:26:08.270]  We have been infiltrated.
[01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:10.852]  They're in with all the military systems.
[01:26:10.852 --> 01:26:13.393]  They're in with all the military systems that started it.
[01:26:13.393 --> 01:26:16.315]  That's where it all comes from.
[01:26:16.315 --> 01:26:16.615]  No, no.
[01:26:16.615 --> 01:26:17.516]  I totally agree with you.
[01:26:17.516 --> 01:26:18.537]  I totally agree with you.
[01:26:18.537 --> 01:26:24.781]  When I say we're occupied, we've been infiltrated, these are collaborators, that's really what's going on.
[01:26:24.781 --> 01:26:25.641]  That isn't rhetoric.
[01:26:25.641 --> 01:26:26.862]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:26:28.676 --> 01:26:35.661]  I just, I really feel like, uh, I hope I'm wrong, but I think Obama might be our last president.
[01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:36.982]  Obama!
[01:26:36.982 --> 01:26:38.063]  Obama!
[01:26:38.063 --> 01:26:38.823]  Obama!
[01:26:38.823 --> 01:26:48.450]  I had a dream that we were in a bar, and we started a karaoke, it was a karaoke bar, we were doing, and you kept correcting everybody on how to do the Obama thing.
[01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:51.652]  Oh, and on another note, I wanted to ask you a personal question.
[01:26:51.652 --> 01:26:57.596]  You asked, you said on the air one time, uh, you better have a sweater if you're going to hell, because it's not hot, it's cold, dark, damp, and wet.
[01:26:58.132 --> 01:26:58.792]  How do you know that?
[01:26:58.792 --> 01:27:02.974]  Because I say that to everybody.
[01:27:02.974 --> 01:27:08.337]  Well, I'm going off Dante's Inferno, that freezing cold feels like burning.
[01:27:08.337 --> 01:27:10.358]  You've ever been in, like, Sub-Zero?
[01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:11.078]  And I'm sure you have.
[01:27:11.078 --> 01:27:14.360]  Folks in Minnesota can attest to that, or Chicago and Illinois.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.102]  And in Dante's Inferno, the Ninth Circle is frozen.
[01:27:18.102 --> 01:27:20.343]  So it's more of an allegory.
[01:27:20.343 --> 01:27:25.125]  It was a personal near-death experience, how I felt it, because I was trying to be pulled into it.
[01:27:25.788 --> 01:27:33.030]  So yeah, I was hitting the head with a pickaxe right there in Fort Worth, Texas in 1986 by a road rage incident, yep.
[01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.730]  And what happened?
[01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:37.111]  You felt like you were being pulled into the frozen gulfs of hell?
[01:27:37.111 --> 01:27:44.453]  No, I felt like I was just being pulled into the darkest pit of blackness, cold, damp, and very uncomfortable that I've ever seen.
[01:27:44.453 --> 01:27:48.734]  And then I felt a right hand on my left shoulder and a voice said, son, you can lay there and die, you can get up.
[01:27:48.734 --> 01:27:49.835]  And I was like, who in the hell is this?
[01:27:49.835 --> 01:27:54.956]  And I looked around, I was 21, raised Southern Baptist, didn't know if there was a God or not, didn't really care at the time.
[01:27:55.481 --> 01:27:56.181]  Yeah, when was that?
[01:27:56.181 --> 01:27:56.722]  Was that in the 80s?
[01:27:56.722 --> 01:27:57.082]  Yeah, I know.
[01:27:57.082 --> 01:28:01.905]  Dallas and Fort Worth were the number one crime rate in the country then, and it was just slaughterhouse.
[01:28:01.905 --> 01:28:02.986]  Some days, they had 20 murders a day.
[01:28:20.802 --> 01:28:28.550]  And I grew up in that, where just people in a red light, if you looked at them wrong, they would just get out of their car and go, RAAAWR, and just start killing each other.
[01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:29.811]  Hey, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:28:29.811 --> 01:28:30.512]  Great points, brother.
[01:28:30.512 --> 01:28:31.413]  Gotta jump.
[01:28:31.413 --> 01:28:34.776]  Okay, let's go to our phone system, James, George, Andrea, Rich, and others.
[01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:35.757]  James, thanks for holding.
[01:28:35.757 --> 01:28:36.258]  You're on the air.
[01:28:38.425 --> 01:28:39.125]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:40.986]  Good.
[01:28:40.986 --> 01:28:45.547]  But when I see the whole, you know, all this stuff is scripted.
[01:28:45.547 --> 01:28:54.770]  Also, if you think about Fletcher Prouty, and you connect the dots with everybody that has been saying it, all this stuff has been interconnected with Spencer.
[01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:58.431]  Also, everything, even Russia.
[01:28:59.705 --> 01:29:05.049]  Remember, the book came out a long time ago called End Wars with Tom Clancy.
[01:29:05.049 --> 01:29:06.470]  Yes.
[01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:08.011]  Yeah, okay.
[01:29:08.011 --> 01:29:11.114]  Obama is not legit.
[01:29:11.114 --> 01:29:16.158]  We know the whole system is not legit because of the reason that it has been scripted.
[01:29:16.158 --> 01:29:24.364]  Even when you go to the Illuminati card, it shows you at the end of the whole process, they rewind the whole movie and start it again.
[01:29:26.425 --> 01:29:33.088]  And if people get to the point that understand that the whole world, as it is, is a script.
[01:29:33.088 --> 01:29:34.789]  Tell you what, I'm gonna come back and let you finish.
[01:29:34.789 --> 01:29:35.989]  This sounds interesting.
[01:29:35.989 --> 01:29:39.411]  By the way, the Illuminati card guy lives in Austin.
[01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:41.692]  His office is like three miles from us.
[01:29:41.692 --> 01:29:45.154]  My reporters are going over there this week.
[01:29:45.154 --> 01:29:46.774]  I just keep saying go over there, it never happens.
[01:29:46.774 --> 01:29:47.655]  We're gonna go over there.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:53.826]  Because I've been asking for an interview with that guy for like 10 years.
[01:29:53.826 --> 01:29:54.547]  And that's it too!
[01:29:54.547 --> 01:29:57.171]  We're sending our reporters over to Stratford.
[01:29:57.171 --> 01:29:58.433]  They're bad-mouthing me in their emails.
[01:29:59.963 --> 01:30:08.066]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:30:08.066 --> 01:30:10.307]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:30:10.307 --> 01:30:13.009]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:30:13.009 --> 01:30:17.430]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:20.612]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:30:20.612 --> 01:30:27.875]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:32.359]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:30:32.359 --> 01:30:34.180]  We are the true media.
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.863]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:30:36.863 --> 01:30:40.626]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[01:31:00.256 --> 01:31:04.299]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:31:04.299 --> 01:31:08.682]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:31:08.682 --> 01:31:12.345]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:31:12.345 --> 01:31:15.387]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:22.633]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:31:22.953 --> 01:31:26.857]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:31.282]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:31:31.282 --> 01:31:37.248]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:31:37.248 --> 01:31:41.192]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:31:41.192 --> 01:31:43.935]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:31:43.935 --> 01:31:45.296]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:46.776]  It's time to take action.
[01:31:46.776 --> 01:31:48.617]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:32:00.241 --> 01:32:04.963]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[01:32:04.963 --> 01:32:06.163]  Why do we have the highest
[01:32:06.283 --> 01:32:13.629]  Cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:15.571]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:17.212]  We are what we eat.
[01:32:17.212 --> 01:32:21.876]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:32:21.876 --> 01:32:26.100]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:28.362]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:32:28.642 --> 01:32:34.871]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:33:18.206 --> 01:33:19.407]  Hear that beat?
[01:33:19.407 --> 01:33:21.388]  That's the New Old Order beat.
[01:33:21.388 --> 01:33:24.870]  They just slow and easy slit the throat of freedom.
[01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:27.151]  Overthrow every basic liberty.
[01:33:27.151 --> 01:33:32.934]  Grandstand arrogantly, always holding on to power to make us feel like we're weak and alone.
[01:33:32.934 --> 01:33:33.895]  We gotta have the same beat.
[01:33:35.848 --> 01:33:37.690]  You just never stop promoting liberty.
[01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:38.531]  Never stop fighting.
[01:33:38.531 --> 01:33:40.012]  It's not work to fight.
[01:33:40.012 --> 01:33:41.174]  It's living.
[01:33:41.174 --> 01:33:44.417]  Resistance is victory.
[01:33:44.417 --> 01:33:50.163]  We're gonna just slow and easy tear their arms out of their sockets.
[01:33:50.163 --> 01:33:52.745]  Slow and easy strangle the New World Order.
[01:33:52.745 --> 01:33:54.167]  Slow and easy, never stop.
[01:33:54.167 --> 01:33:55.949]  Just apply the pressure.
[01:33:55.949 --> 01:33:56.950]  Just like you're in a fist fight.
[01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:01.013]  You just don't think about who's winning.
[01:34:01.013 --> 01:34:05.376]  Don't stop to wait to see if the punch you just threw knocked the guy down.
[01:34:05.376 --> 01:34:07.118]  Just keep swinging.
[01:34:07.118 --> 01:34:08.819]  Keep swinging.
[01:34:08.819 --> 01:34:10.080]  Keep swinging.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.085]  You'll know when to stop.
[01:34:15.085 --> 01:34:18.447]  So many times in a race, somebody starts looking over their shoulder and starts losing the race.
[01:34:18.447 --> 01:34:19.789]  Either swimming or running.
[01:34:19.789 --> 01:34:21.510]  Same thing in a fight.
[01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:23.872]  Some guy starts a fight with you and knocks you upside the head.
[01:34:23.872 --> 01:34:25.934]  You don't punch him once and then see if they fall down.
[01:34:28.203 --> 01:34:37.487]  You punch them right in the throat, then you punch them in the stomach, they're still standing, you jump on top of them, slam their head in the ground.
[01:34:37.487 --> 01:34:44.711]  They attacked you, so you're gonna deal with them.
[01:34:44.711 --> 01:34:49.273]  Punch them in the throat, punch them in the stomach, jump on top of them.
[01:34:49.273 --> 01:34:50.333]  That'll get the job done.
[01:34:50.333 --> 01:34:53.215]  And that's what we've gotta do with the New World Order.
[01:34:53.215 --> 01:34:55.556]  I wanna rush through your calls, Andrea.
[01:34:58.368 --> 01:35:00.889]  Rich and others and full board of calls over here.
[01:35:00.889 --> 01:35:03.050]  I got two phone systems up.
[01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:05.671]  We have the new flag that I tweeted out at Real Alex Jones.
[01:35:05.671 --> 01:35:07.772]  The new official White House flag.
[01:35:07.772 --> 01:35:15.716]  It's powerful satire that our great graphics crew came up with when I thought of it.
[01:35:15.716 --> 01:35:20.678]  And incidentally, I had an idea for a promo trailer exposing tyranny.
[01:35:22.113 --> 01:35:28.519]  Dealing with the film They Live, one of my favorite sci-fi films, an allegory of reality, John Carpenter, the master filmmaker.
[01:35:28.519 --> 01:35:32.282]  And of course, Rowdy Piper's a listener and been on the show.
[01:35:32.282 --> 01:35:37.426]  So he took his interview, a few minutes long, and cut it into the film and some other stuff.
[01:35:37.426 --> 01:35:39.488]  That's coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:35:39.488 --> 01:35:40.929]  It's like three minutes long.
[01:35:40.929 --> 01:35:44.633]  With Jordan Maxwell, so stay with us for that.
[01:35:44.633 --> 01:35:47.235]  Now, before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:35:54.824 --> 01:35:59.628]  I get up here and I chatter and I tell you, you need to support the broadcast by buying the great products we sell.
[01:35:59.628 --> 01:36:06.313]  That means we sell high quality products that are the very best we can find at the lowest price to be also competitive.
[01:36:06.313 --> 01:36:08.976]  We believe in a win-win-win.
[01:36:08.976 --> 01:36:21.426]  Promote First Amendment, promote freedom, promote the Second Amendment, promote the right to liberty, promote property rights, promote sovereignty, and get great products.
[01:36:22.665 --> 01:36:30.130]  Made in America Pro-Gun t-shirts, the Pro-Pure, Pro-One, G2 filters that cut off the glyphosates, the fluoride.
[01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:35.433]  There is no comparison in the side-by-side comparisons on InfoWarsTore.com between leading competitors.
[01:36:35.433 --> 01:36:37.455]  I would sell to leading competitors, and I have in the past.
[01:36:37.455 --> 01:36:40.957]  This is just so good, this is what I sell, and they have great customer service.
[01:36:43.103 --> 01:36:53.170]  We want partnerships with companies that have quality products, that have great customer service, that long-term we can have a relationship with to fund our operation while helping people.
[01:36:53.170 --> 01:36:58.114]  If you're not filtering your water, you are cuckoo cocoa puffs.
[01:36:58.114 --> 01:37:03.698]  Most of the bottled water has just been put through charcoal to make it taste okay.
[01:37:03.698 --> 01:37:05.900]  It's basically deadly tap water with all the runoff.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.621]  You've got to filter your water.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:14.281]  Reverse osmosis is good for cooking and stuff, but it doesn't have enough minerals in it long-term.
[01:37:14.281 --> 01:37:15.941]  You need to drink reverse osmosis.
[01:37:15.941 --> 01:37:19.562]  I would do that and this.
[01:37:19.562 --> 01:37:21.743]  That's what I believe, and it's powerful.
[01:37:21.743 --> 01:37:24.023]  It's what the medical doctors have told me.
[01:37:24.023 --> 01:37:31.305]  For your family and to support this broadcast, get a Pro-1 G 2.0 system.
[01:37:31.305 --> 01:37:34.465]  They've got them from 50-something bucks up to 300.
[01:37:34.465 --> 01:37:37.206]  No one can compete with the pricing of their pitcher-based system.
[01:37:38.346 --> 01:37:46.335]  And the Stainless Steel Systems InfowarsStore.com are call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:46.335 --> 01:37:48.237]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:37:48.237 --> 01:37:54.844]  10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:37:54.844 --> 01:37:59.669]  Or the deadly dihydrogen monoxide that Obama supporters want to ban because it sounds scary like carbon dioxide.
[01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:05.419]  So, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:05.419 --> 01:38:09.683]  And then we have InfoWarsLife.com with the Super Mel Vitality.
[01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:10.724]  You've heard the right reviews.
[01:38:10.724 --> 01:38:16.549]  It's just concentrated super herbs that block estrogen mimickers and help the glands operate, according to Dr. Grip and others.
[01:38:16.549 --> 01:38:17.570]  And all I know is it works.
[01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:19.832]  So, just try it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:19.832 --> 01:38:23.395]  You're supporting the broadcast and I think you'll become a long-time user of it.
[01:38:24.212 --> 01:38:41.062]  The great nascent iodine to protect some of the glands and things with all the toxic stuff going on, to detox, the fluoride shield, this nascent iodine and five other compounds, the lung cleanse, the great coffee from southern Mexico, organic, high mountain, Chiapas grown by the rebels, literally.
[01:38:41.062 --> 01:38:43.884]  Like, getting this stuff's like, I guess, trying to get dope or something out of Mexico.
[01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:49.868]  We buy as much as we can at one swath, it's all certified down there, it's beyond fair trade, from the Chiapas co-op.
[01:38:51.129 --> 01:38:53.850]  In the high mountain, um, organic shade grown.
[01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:55.070]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.970]  That's my favorite copy.
[01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:57.030]  It may not be your favorite.
[01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:58.790]  Regardless, you're supporting the broadcast.
[01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:59.150]  Okay.
[01:38:59.150 --> 01:39:00.271]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:00.271 --> 01:39:01.011]  I'm done.
[01:39:01.011 --> 01:39:02.571]  Or become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:39:02.571 --> 01:39:03.991]  Share your membership on that front.
[01:39:03.991 --> 01:39:08.772]  Now let's race through calls, because I've got to get into the attack on First Amendment that's unprecedented.
[01:39:08.772 --> 01:39:13.273]  Uh, let's go, uh, back to James in Houston.
[01:39:13.273 --> 01:39:16.054]  You were getting into it all being scripted.
[01:39:16.054 --> 01:39:16.534]  I know this.
[01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:17.834]  The Tom Clancy video games?
[01:39:20.009 --> 01:39:24.031]  And all the rest of it literally shows who the next threat is.
[01:39:24.031 --> 01:39:31.935]  You know, there's going to be an attack in Georgia a year before their video game comes out and it shows the war that actually happened.
[01:39:31.935 --> 01:39:36.757]  And so, yes, they do flaunt what they're doing ahead of time in our face.
[01:39:36.757 --> 01:39:43.140]  And I've had Steve Pchenik, former head of PSYOPS for the State Department that's above the CIA, say that on air.
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.241]  He wrote books with Tom Clancy.
[01:39:44.974 --> 01:39:46.055]  We're going to get him back on soon.
[01:39:46.055 --> 01:39:48.916]  In fact, if he wants to come on, I want him on a topic I want to cover.
[01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:52.138]  I know he's got a new Tom Clancy book coming out that wasn't completed.
[01:39:52.138 --> 01:39:53.238]  He was working on.
[01:39:53.238 --> 01:39:54.079]  He wants to talk about that.
[01:39:54.079 --> 01:39:54.439]  That's great.
[01:39:54.439 --> 01:39:57.300]  I know he listens.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:08.086]  But I want him to come on and talk about predictive programming and how they put it out there beforehand and where he thinks this system is going.
[01:40:08.086 --> 01:40:09.507]  Okay, go ahead and make your point, James.
[01:40:09.507 --> 01:40:10.007]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:11.081 --> 01:40:14.865]  Okay, Alex, I've seen this a long time ago as a kid.
[01:40:14.865 --> 01:40:19.670]  My dad worked for the TG Geer Command back in the 50s and 60s.
[01:40:19.670 --> 01:40:22.333]  And the word is POGO.
[01:40:22.333 --> 01:40:27.438]  And POGO, it was an article that came out in a cartoon every week.
[01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:31.543]  If you notice, the little caption was, I saw the enemy and the enemy was us.
[01:40:32.483 --> 01:40:37.247]  And this is what the global elites and all these people have done, have manipulated us.
[01:40:37.247 --> 01:40:39.570]  In other words, made our own stuff the enemy.
[01:40:39.570 --> 01:40:44.214]  And we don't even know it, that they have no power unless we give it to them.
[01:40:45.063 --> 01:40:50.107]  And so, also, there is a movie out called Hidden Colors.
[01:40:50.107 --> 01:41:03.877]  Everybody needs to see that movie on how they have squashed information that everybody needs to know about how the world really works, and how Spectre works, and how they created all this stuff by nothing but manipulation.
[01:41:04.935 --> 01:41:10.576]  Fletcher Prouty has some DVDs out on the Black Ops Radio.
[01:41:10.576 --> 01:41:15.917]  You need to get that information that he gives everybody for what's behind the scenes.
[01:41:15.917 --> 01:41:17.858]  That's right.
[01:41:17.858 --> 01:41:19.878]  I've heard the Fletcher Prouty Road to Serfdom.
[01:41:19.878 --> 01:41:20.878]  I've read his book.
[01:41:20.878 --> 01:41:21.838]  I've heard those interviews.
[01:41:21.838 --> 01:41:29.580]  We should air old segments of G. Edward Griffin, Fletcher Prouty and others weekly on the Nightly News from the archive.
[01:41:30.222 --> 01:41:37.604]  You know, show Welsh warning people back in the 50s of the John Birch Society, everything that would unfold, and show that famous speech he gave.
[01:41:37.604 --> 01:41:46.546]  We should show, you know, how they warned us, or those that came before us, a warning from the past, and show how incredibly accurate people were.
[01:41:46.546 --> 01:41:49.166]  But I want to explain what you just said, and I appreciate your call.
[01:41:49.166 --> 01:41:50.067]  God bless you.
[01:41:50.067 --> 01:41:51.127]  Very sophisticated point.
[01:41:52.245 --> 01:41:56.306]  And people like James in Houston should start his own radio show.
[01:41:56.306 --> 01:42:01.728]  James should start his own YouTube and just do it once a week or once a day or whatever he wants to do.
[01:42:01.728 --> 01:42:08.910]  This type of knowledge and what his dad told him in PsyOps should be passed on.
[01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:10.791]  It was passed on to me.
[01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:17.173]  That's one reason I know about all this stuff is I had some family that worked in clandestine stuff and they were just like, it's all pure bull.
[01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:19.273]  And they explained to you how it worked and that it was evil.
[01:42:23.863 --> 01:42:27.325]  It isn't that the communist Chinese aren't real.
[01:42:27.325 --> 01:42:31.306]  It's that the globalists put them in power and keep them on a short leash.
[01:42:31.306 --> 01:42:33.247]  It isn't that communism wasn't a real threat.
[01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:37.889]  Our government, and the British government on record, put Lenin in and gave him the money with Stalin.
[01:42:37.889 --> 01:42:39.870]  He was the bag man that brought him the money.
[01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:42.211]  And 100,000 US and British troops.
[01:42:42.211 --> 01:42:44.332]  Sheep-dipped.
[01:42:44.332 --> 01:42:49.254]  Former military people that happened to be of Russian extract or spoke Russian.
[01:42:49.254 --> 01:42:51.015]  Mainly off the East Coast.
[01:42:51.015 --> 01:42:52.095]  That's all declassified.
[01:42:55.057 --> 01:43:03.685]  So, they're all intersecting at the top, but they're always double dealing and stabbing each other in the back too.
[01:43:03.685 --> 01:43:08.229]  Double, triple, quadruple agents, triple crosses, quadruple crosses.
[01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:13.339]  Basically it's just total deceit and fraud and dishonor.
[01:43:13.339 --> 01:43:16.359]  So it has no mooring, it has no place.
[01:43:16.359 --> 01:43:18.220]  And that whole system is dying.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:21.341]  Coming in will be the new age of chivalry.
[01:43:21.341 --> 01:43:26.862]  I don't mean the globalist fake new age of occultism and the rest of it.
[01:43:26.862 --> 01:43:30.963]  I mean a new system coming in to replace the old.
[01:43:30.963 --> 01:43:33.924]  They want to replace the old evil system with something even more evil.
[01:43:35.154 --> 01:43:38.515]  So there are fights between the Russians and the West.
[01:43:38.515 --> 01:43:44.456]  But at the highest levels, it's globalists on both sides who are manipulating Putin, Obama, you name it.
[01:43:44.456 --> 01:43:52.598]  It goes a lot higher than Putin and Obama because they're globalists above the countries that feed off the war, feed off the order out of chaos.
[01:43:52.598 --> 01:43:57.959]  Just like in the James Bond movie, Russia Love, he explains how the one Siamese fighting fish kills the other.
[01:43:57.959 --> 01:43:59.420]  It's now exhausted.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.160]  Spectre comes in and kills the other one.
[01:44:03.433 --> 01:44:07.397]  And it's just very childlike, they're telling you though, how it works.
[01:44:07.397 --> 01:44:11.161]  It's very sophisticated while also very simple.
[01:44:11.161 --> 01:44:12.862]  It's like racism is real.
[01:44:12.862 --> 01:44:16.606]  It's manufactured, it's pushed, but differences then form.
[01:44:16.606 --> 01:44:18.969]  People have real beefs.
[01:44:18.969 --> 01:44:24.094]  Racism might be wrong, it might be a fraud, but when somebody's trying to kill you, it's real.
[01:44:26.423 --> 01:44:29.526]  A group of blacks are chasing you down because you're white, wanting to kill you.
[01:44:29.526 --> 01:44:34.730]  In Chicago, because they're racist and bigoted and brainwashed, it may be baloney, but they're still trying to kill you.
[01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:38.794]  You may be in East Texas with a group of white Klansmen, you're black, chasing you down, trying to kill you.
[01:44:38.794 --> 01:44:40.975]  You may know it's all a big lie and a fraud.
[01:44:40.975 --> 01:44:44.018]  Doesn't matter, they're going to try to kill you!
[01:44:44.018 --> 01:44:46.640]  It's just like the Russia situation.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.064]  Yeah, it's fake at the highest level, up at that capstone, but not below it.
[01:44:51.064 --> 01:44:52.045]  It's all real.
[01:44:52.045 --> 01:44:53.686]  It's real people killing each other.
[01:44:53.686 --> 01:44:54.327]  It's real war.
[01:44:56.494 --> 01:44:58.956]  Very powerful point you just made.
[01:44:58.956 --> 01:45:00.096]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:45:00.096 --> 01:45:01.557]  Oh, we've got such loaded phones here.
[01:45:01.557 --> 01:45:02.158]  I really gotta hurry.
[01:45:02.158 --> 01:45:03.378]  I gotta get into this free speech thing.
[01:45:03.378 --> 01:45:04.899]  I mean, that's really the big news.
[01:45:04.899 --> 01:45:06.140]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.641]  It's so huge.
[01:45:07.641 --> 01:45:09.562]  Let's go to Andrea in California.
[01:45:09.562 --> 01:45:11.664]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:11.664 --> 01:45:14.405]  First time caller and long time listener.
[01:45:14.405 --> 01:45:22.030]  I was turned on to you by a friend that had to flee Cuba back when, you know, and so he wasn't always here.
[01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:23.111]  I think that we've been like
[01:45:23.522 --> 01:45:25.923]  I'm not, I'm not sophisticated.
[01:45:25.923 --> 01:45:28.784]  Let me get a couple thoughts out.
[01:45:28.784 --> 01:45:36.747]  That domestic violence is very similar to what's going on in the women that are being, you know, that are involved in that.
[01:45:36.747 --> 01:45:42.610]  They get this, what you're talking about, being controlled through fear, and then they learn helplessness.
[01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:45.371]  We've learned helplessness as a country, I believe.
[01:45:45.371 --> 01:45:48.272]  It's hard to break through that, but that's what needs to be done.
[01:45:48.272 --> 01:45:49.492]  I'm really nervous.
[01:45:49.492 --> 01:45:50.373]  I need it.
[01:45:50.373 --> 01:45:53.014]  And then the first amendment,
[01:45:53.510 --> 01:46:04.332]  That would mean that books... I love books, and I read... From you and Mark Stein, who writes about Canada and the European Union, and the no-go zones for police.
[01:46:04.332 --> 01:46:05.032]  They won't go there.
[01:46:05.032 --> 01:46:07.352]  It has to do with other things.
[01:46:07.352 --> 01:46:19.715]  And then one other point is, while we're not populating, there are other cultures that are at a rapid pace, and there's going to be many, many more of them than anybody else.
[01:46:19.715 --> 01:46:21.475]  I have a lot more to say, but I know you're in a hurry.
[01:46:22.674 --> 01:46:24.556]  Well, no, that's a lot of really good points.
[01:46:24.556 --> 01:46:30.561]  And again, the globalists control the West, so they're programming the West to commit suicide.
[01:46:30.561 --> 01:46:33.884]  They will program the rest of the world to commit cultural suicide.
[01:46:33.884 --> 01:46:36.005]  Great points.
[01:46:36.005 --> 01:46:37.507]  I want to go to more of your calls here.
[01:46:37.507 --> 01:46:39.769]  Let's go to Mark in Indiana on Common Core.
[01:46:39.769 --> 01:46:40.409]  You're on the air.
[01:46:40.409 --> 01:46:42.231]  Go ahead.
[01:46:42.231 --> 01:46:43.332]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:46:43.332 --> 01:46:44.773]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:44.773 --> 01:46:49.137]  If you know, Indiana is the first state that bailed out of Common Core.
[01:46:51.121 --> 01:46:54.225]  Yes, a lot of states are starting to bail out, and it's very exciting.
[01:46:54.225 --> 01:46:54.926]  It's pure evil.
[01:46:54.926 --> 01:46:59.511]  I just thought you wanted to know.
[01:46:59.511 --> 01:47:00.773]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:47:00.773 --> 01:47:02.235]  Thank you very much.
[01:47:02.235 --> 01:47:04.698]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in California on Ukraine.
[01:47:04.698 --> 01:47:07.161]  Go ahead.
[01:47:07.161 --> 01:47:07.581]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:08.897 --> 01:47:12.880]  Ukraine seems like a huge distraction, like your other caller was saying.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:17.063]  Well, no, they're absorbing the country and looting it under the IMF.
[01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:22.647]  It is a distraction, but they're really ruining that country, and then they're going to move on to the next country.
[01:47:22.647 --> 01:47:23.808]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:47:23.808 --> 01:47:25.149]  It's just their agenda.
[01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:33.936]  They're on the same agenda to just destabilize, get the Western-backed government in power so they can totally just
[01:47:34.771 --> 01:47:41.154]  You usurp all the rest of the power from all the government, from all the local governments, and just completely take over.
[01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:45.936]  I want to make a quick point on the global warming thing that's going on right now, though.
[01:47:45.936 --> 01:47:51.658]  Well, I mean, they've got all these globalists running around saying, 99% of scientists say it's real, when the whole thing's collapsed.
[01:47:51.658 --> 01:47:58.921]  I mean, it's more, I invented the internet, raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise the debt, 2 plus 2 equals 5 garbage.
[01:47:58.921 --> 01:48:00.622]  Exactly, and it's always, always based
[01:48:01.144 --> 01:48:01.364]  All right.
[01:48:16.644 --> 01:48:18.404]  About 321 square miles?
[01:48:18.404 --> 01:48:19.004]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:48:19.004 --> 01:48:21.725]  There are some areas where humans are too packed in.
[01:48:21.725 --> 01:48:28.446]  We have some problems with some of our resource development systems and some of our toxic industrial systems, but we can transcend it all.
[01:48:28.446 --> 01:48:30.947]  We're being suppressed in an artificial dark age.
[01:48:30.947 --> 01:48:31.487]  Great points.
[01:48:31.487 --> 01:48:32.487]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:32.487 --> 01:48:33.527]  All right.
[01:48:33.527 --> 01:48:39.968]  I'm going to go to Murph and others.
[01:48:39.968 --> 01:48:43.609]  Ed, Kathy, George, Rich, and Scott.
[01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:43.969]  After I
[01:48:45.632 --> 01:48:47.132]  Get to this other news I've got.
[01:48:47.132 --> 01:48:56.575]  Man, I tell you, this attack on free speech is so big, I don't even know how I properly just cover it all.
[01:48:56.575 --> 01:49:02.437]  My problem is I get obsessed with all the different minutiae and then never even get to it.
[01:49:02.437 --> 01:49:07.399]  When we come back from break, I'm going to try to sum up the latest news and tie it into the larger plan of what they're doing.
[01:49:09.278 --> 01:49:17.064]  They're setting up these new internet police that even again the Boston Herald calls draconian, calls chilling.
[01:49:17.064 --> 01:49:26.931]  They're coming in with PAC-SEC stuff to bring in election law against talk radio and internet media like Drudge and Infowars.
[01:49:26.931 --> 01:49:28.252]  The FCC head has said that.
[01:49:30.114 --> 01:49:31.194]  And you're like, oh, who cares?
[01:49:31.194 --> 01:49:40.038]  Well, I mean, they arrested Dinesh D'Souza because he reportedly got five of his friends to give $3,000 to his college roommate who was running for the Senate.
[01:49:40.038 --> 01:49:41.659]  And lost.
[01:49:41.659 --> 01:49:44.540]  But dared run for Hillary's old seat.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:53.363]  I mean, Obama took hundreds of millions publicly from foreign donors, every donation a felony.
[01:49:53.363 --> 01:49:54.524]  Saudi money, you name it.
[01:49:55.805 --> 01:50:04.376]  Chinese government money, and literally for a crooked toenail, Dinesh D'Souza is facing, what is it, five years in prison.
[01:50:04.376 --> 01:50:12.306]  So they're going to announce that I'm not allowed to say that I don't like Obama, and then they're going to try to have me arrested by the FBI.
[01:50:12.306 --> 01:50:12.907]  They will do it.
[01:50:12.907 --> 01:50:14.009]  They want to put me in jail.
[01:50:15.606 --> 01:50:17.427]  They're trying to shut down the pro-life groups, everybody.
[01:50:17.427 --> 01:50:19.788]  It is just dirtbag, pure evil.
[01:50:19.788 --> 01:50:25.050]  And if the American people put up with it, look, I'm going to keep saying whatever I want.
[01:50:25.050 --> 01:50:28.271]  I got the First Amendment, you scum.
[01:50:28.271 --> 01:50:39.396]  You filthy, degenerate, murdering, fascist, Al-Qaeda funding, degenerate, murderous, criminal, lying, evil White House.
[01:50:39.396 --> 01:50:44.178]  You anti-American, anti-family, viperous scum of the earth.
[01:50:45.242 --> 01:50:47.463]  Damn you to Hades.
[01:50:47.463 --> 01:50:49.364]  I am sick of you.
[01:50:49.364 --> 01:50:53.345]  And we've now gotten to the point, they shut off the free speech, they're going to take everything.
[01:50:53.345 --> 01:50:57.626]  Your pension funds, everything, and SWAT teams are literally going to take you to FEMA camps.
[01:50:57.626 --> 01:50:58.787]  They want to gut this country.
[01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:03.515]  Harvest Right is the world's first in-home freeze-dryer.

[01:52:58.747 --> 01:53:02.789]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:53:02.789 --> 01:53:06.751]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:53:07.091 --> 01:53:10.735]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:53:10.735 --> 01:53:13.738]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:53:13.738 --> 01:53:21.265]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:53:21.265 --> 01:53:24.869]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:29.512]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:53:29.512 --> 01:53:35.436]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:53:35.436 --> 01:53:39.358]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:53:39.358 --> 01:53:42.080]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.561]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:53:43.561 --> 01:53:44.902]  It's time to take action.
[01:53:44.902 --> 01:53:46.743]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:53:54.248 --> 01:54:02.937]  Our call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:02.937 --> 01:54:07.421]  Come, you masters of war.
[01:54:07.421 --> 01:54:11.785]  It'll build a big guns.
[01:54:11.785 --> 01:54:13.447]  It'll build a death plane.
[01:54:14.289 --> 01:54:38.008]  To quantify what the caller from Houston was saying earlier, there are famous letters, we ought to pull them up and find them, I saw them on Discovery Channel probably 20 years ago and then later found them online once, where there were letters between the French Norman King and the British Norman King, who were cousins, first cousins, saying we're having uprisings in both our countries, we need to have a war.
[01:54:38.008 --> 01:54:40.630]  And then they would even predetermine where they were going to have a war.
[01:54:44.346 --> 01:54:45.486]  And then they would have a war.
[01:54:45.486 --> 01:54:47.007]  But I mean, it was a real war.
[01:54:47.007 --> 01:54:48.327]  People died.
[01:54:48.327 --> 01:54:50.968]  And the British and French hate each other to this day.
[01:54:50.968 --> 01:54:54.189]  And most of it was totally fake.
[01:54:54.189 --> 01:55:07.973]  It was the Normans, who were really Vikings that conquered France, finding a way to kill off their populations of French and of Anglo-Saxons.
[01:55:07.973 --> 01:55:12.894]  So French and Anglo-Saxons were played off against each other to kill each other for the Vikings.
[01:55:15.097 --> 01:55:17.818]  People think, you know, the Vikings just ran around in ships robbing people.
[01:55:17.818 --> 01:55:21.719]  No, the Vikings took over Europe a thousand years ago.
[01:55:21.719 --> 01:55:30.662]  And then they took over 900 and something years ago, they took over Britannia, Albion, Scotland, Ireland.
[01:55:30.662 --> 01:55:31.542]  And you know why they took over?
[01:55:31.542 --> 01:55:37.204]  Because they had everybody kill each other.
[01:55:37.204 --> 01:55:37.664]  That's why.
[01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:40.545]  Because they made backroom deals and said, let's kill our own people in a war.
[01:55:43.772 --> 01:55:54.372]  Now, they want to censor the internet and they're doing it through moves to tax, CISPA, SOPA, Cyber Command, FBI backdoors that are in all the systems, releasing worms and things to ruin the old internet.
[01:55:55.663 --> 01:56:04.749]  Bring internet to, they say, a safe where you biometrically access to go online, then they can track you, tax you, control you, give you three strikes, you're out.
[01:56:04.749 --> 01:56:16.377]  Separately, they're coming out with FCC taxpayer-paid for broadband that the FCC now claims gives them jurisdiction over the internet, and they're saying they're going to have political officers that go around and visit newsrooms.
[01:56:16.377 --> 01:56:17.318]  That's been out for about a year.
[01:56:18.118 --> 01:56:19.579]  We broke that about a year ago.
[01:56:19.579 --> 01:56:21.120]  It's now been mainstream news.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:29.187]  Now the FCC chair warns the conservative media like Drudge Report face regulation like PACS.
[01:56:29.187 --> 01:56:41.497]  And the chairman is concerned, because the rest of the committee is going this direction and Congress is, that these new groups are going to say they're political and tax them as a shadow
[01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:44.230]  Fairness doctrine.
[01:56:44.230 --> 01:57:00.396]  Well yeah, that was you couldn't have talk radio till 88 because you quote weren't allowed to be political and if someone heard you political they would complain and the FCC would come in and say let us hear the tapes of your morning show hosts were they bad-mouthing the City Council.
[01:57:00.396 --> 01:57:01.336]  I mean think about that.
[01:57:01.336 --> 01:57:10.519]  That's how after World War II Americans got so compliant with government because we were the good guys that we would let them not let you have your own First Amendment.
[01:57:11.308 --> 01:57:12.729]  This is so fundamental.
[01:57:12.729 --> 01:57:15.471]  It's even more important than the second.
[01:57:15.471 --> 01:57:17.432]  I mean, they shut your mouth up, folks!
[01:57:17.432 --> 01:57:21.214]  You're shut up!
[01:57:21.214 --> 01:57:24.396]  Well, here's another one out of the hill.
[01:57:24.396 --> 01:57:28.579]  FCC's grab for new regulatory power could go beyond broadband providers.
[01:57:30.230 --> 01:57:31.130]  To the entire internet.
[01:57:31.130 --> 01:57:32.931]  They're moving to end net neutrality.
[01:57:32.931 --> 01:57:35.353]  Net neutrality's death could spark populist revolt.
[01:57:35.353 --> 01:57:40.235]  With echoes of the Gilded Age, Washington coddles money to monopolistic internet barons.
[01:57:40.235 --> 01:57:42.817]  National Journal breaks it all down.
[01:57:42.817 --> 01:57:49.620]  And they're all hitting at every level right now because MSNBC's normal shows have about 90,000 viewers.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:51.181]  Their bigger show's 200,000.
[01:57:51.181 --> 01:57:52.862]  Their top show on a top night.
[01:57:53.502 --> 01:57:56.523]  When an airplane goes down or something, 600,000.
[01:57:56.523 --> 01:58:03.164]  Folks, they're already gone, but we still watch it subconsciously and think it's the authority.
[01:58:03.164 --> 01:58:05.824]  They're not gonna let us beat them without a fight.
[01:58:05.824 --> 01:58:09.185]  They're coming to shut us up, a bunch of authoritarian scum.
[01:58:09.185 --> 01:58:15.466]  Here's what Obama said at the Correspondents' Dinner.
[01:58:15.466 --> 01:58:20.307]  MSNBC is here.
[01:58:20.307 --> 01:58:21.267]  They're a little overwhelmed.
[01:58:22.441 --> 01:58:24.962]  They've never seen an audience this big before.
[01:58:24.962 --> 01:58:26.563]  He makes a joke out of it, he's scared.
[01:58:26.563 --> 01:58:34.368]  He knows we know he's a criminal dirtbag, piece of filth, anti-American fascist, working for foreign banks, gutting this country!
[01:58:34.368 --> 01:58:42.553]  Your phone calls are coming up, then Jordan Maxwell!
[01:58:42.553 --> 01:58:46.515]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.949 --> 01:58:52.793]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:58:52.793 --> 01:58:57.921]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:58:57.921 --> 01:59:05.753]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:59:06.033 --> 01:59:10.557]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:59:10.557 --> 01:59:14.520]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:20.484]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:59:20.484 --> 01:59:23.647]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:59:23.647 --> 01:59:28.791]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:59:52.864 --> 01:59:55.265]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.265 --> 01:59:58.027]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.724 --> 02:00:09.567]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.567 --> 02:00:11.148]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.148 --> 02:00:12.689]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.689 --> 02:00:16.891]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.891 --> 02:00:20.994]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:41.846]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, taking your phone calls, and we're going to get Jordan Maxwell on to break down some of the programming in the media.
[02:00:41.846 --> 02:00:44.068]  It'll be a very interesting interview.
[02:00:44.068 --> 02:00:46.510]  Also, there's breaking news up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:50.394]  It's a really powerful video that I want to try to get to with Jordan.
[02:00:50.394 --> 02:00:54.538]  Albuquerque residents vowed to storm another city council meeting.
[02:00:54.538 --> 02:00:58.662]  Protestors demand arrest of police chief over spate of shootings.
[02:00:59.867 --> 02:01:01.808]  Spat of shootings.
[02:01:01.808 --> 02:01:03.149]  So, we're going to be getting to that.
[02:01:03.149 --> 02:01:05.251]  It's just huge.
[02:01:05.251 --> 02:01:07.892]  And it shows how, when the people move, it's over.
[02:01:07.892 --> 02:01:12.936]  And if the cops ever shoot a crowd of people like this, the revolution's going to start.
[02:01:12.936 --> 02:01:19.380]  And then you're going to find who the good police are from the bad police, and we'll end up taking back large areas of this country, but then the globals will cut the power off.
[02:01:20.214 --> 02:01:23.097]  And blockade the major railways and hubs.
[02:01:23.097 --> 02:01:28.722]  That's why they've been trying to make us dependent and not self-sufficient, so they can siege the U.S.
[02:01:28.722 --> 02:01:31.104]  and bring us down under the New World Order.
[02:01:31.104 --> 02:01:33.226]  That's the admitted Pentagon plan, by the way.
[02:01:33.226 --> 02:01:35.168]  I'm not saying the troops are involved.
[02:01:35.168 --> 02:01:38.171]  They're the most awake, because they understand military operations.
[02:01:38.171 --> 02:01:41.834]  They can see it being set up against their own families.
[02:01:41.834 --> 02:01:45.317]  Ed Wally, you're on the air from Tejas.
[02:01:45.317 --> 02:01:45.698]  Go ahead.
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.501]  All right, well I'm doing good.
[02:01:49.501 --> 02:01:51.561]  How about you?
[02:01:51.561 --> 02:01:53.002]  All right, he's gone.
[02:01:53.002 --> 02:01:55.323]  Let's go to Kathy in Florida.
[02:01:55.323 --> 02:01:56.263]  Kathy, you're on the air.
[02:01:56.263 --> 02:02:00.185]  Hi, yeah, I had a question.
[02:02:00.185 --> 02:02:09.769]  I was wondering if you thought that the Vatican, specifically the Jesuits, could be the head of the snake?
[02:02:11.007 --> 02:02:13.889]  Well, I mean, there's a New World Order program.
[02:02:13.889 --> 02:02:18.512]  Just like we said, the globalists run the Russians, they run the U.S., they run Israel, they run Japan.
[02:02:18.512 --> 02:02:25.176]  They didn't run Japan, so they went and got them weapons and tricked them into a war and then overthrew them and have controlled them ever since.
[02:02:25.176 --> 02:02:27.577]  I'm not saying the Japanese government was good either.
[02:02:27.577 --> 02:02:29.558]  It just wasn't under globalist control.
[02:02:29.558 --> 02:02:38.544]  But undoubtedly, the Jesuits have been involved in all sorts of political intrigue, promoting the European Union, believing because Europe's Catholic that they'll get their seat in the New World Order.
[02:02:39.444 --> 02:02:43.708]  Uh, but you know, the Jesuits or any other group is a diverse group like the Masons.
[02:02:43.708 --> 02:02:46.351]  But you have the Illuminati infiltrating Masonry.
[02:02:46.351 --> 02:02:48.813]  So it's, it's very sophisticated.
[02:02:48.813 --> 02:02:52.917]  What you have, and this is actually in Cass Sunstein's plans in Divide and Conquer,
[02:02:54.810 --> 02:03:13.508]  Just as we were talking about with the Normans earlier, is that you have schools of thought that say it's the Jews, or it's the Masons, or it's the White Devils, or it's the Black Devils, or it's the Vatican, or it's the Jesuits, or it's the Protestants, or it's the... No, it's predatory people that use systems of manipulation to control and dumb down humanity.
[02:03:14.528 --> 02:03:18.229]  And so that is the threat, is evil people.
[02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:25.431]  Like, I'm not Catholic, but the Catholic Church got infiltrated, like every other form of education and system, by pedophile rings.
[02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:28.192]  Look at Congress, look at Homeland Security.
[02:03:28.192 --> 02:03:35.094]  I mean, it's not that truancy workers are all pedophiles, they just have one of the highest instances of it.
[02:03:35.859 --> 02:03:38.021]  It's not saying everybody at Penn State's a pedophile.
[02:03:38.021 --> 02:03:40.944]  It's a pedophile ring took it over.
[02:03:40.944 --> 02:03:48.612]  So absolutely the Jesuits at certain levels have been involved promoting socialism and things in the last century and I don't like it.
[02:03:48.612 --> 02:03:52.696]  But you could argue they're doing that to control the socialist movement, to stop it.
[02:03:52.696 --> 02:03:56.480]  You could argue the Jesuits worked with Hitler, but also a group worked against them.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:59.342]  So I really historically try to not scapegoat one group
[02:04:00.403 --> 02:04:01.925]  Or the other.
[02:04:01.925 --> 02:04:04.967]  But show where it actually came from or what happened.
[02:04:04.967 --> 02:04:10.031]  I know this, you're not supposed to have anyone from the Society of Jesus as Pope.
[02:04:10.031 --> 02:04:12.293]  So why do you have a Jesuit Pope right now?
[02:04:12.293 --> 02:04:13.874]  That violates Catholic law right there.
[02:04:13.874 --> 02:04:15.656]  You see, this is what I'm talking about.
[02:04:15.656 --> 02:04:18.198]  Very sophisticated things are going on right now, ma'am.
[02:04:18.198 --> 02:04:19.319]  What do you think of what I just said?
[02:04:20.993 --> 02:04:24.336]  Well, I know you're supposed to follow the money, right?
[02:04:24.336 --> 02:04:28.659]  And, um, the Vatican is the one with the most money.
[02:04:28.659 --> 02:04:31.481]  So... And who says that?
[02:04:31.481 --> 02:04:35.804]  Um, I thought it was just known that they have, like, the most money.
[02:04:35.804 --> 02:04:36.665]  I will just say this.
[02:04:36.665 --> 02:04:42.069]  The people that say the Catholics run it all, mainly Seventh-Day Adventists, who are great people, but it's a Seventh-Day Adventist group,
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:46.524]  Lie about me and say that I work for the Vatican and stuff.
[02:04:46.524 --> 02:04:47.485]  It's pure bull.
[02:04:47.485 --> 02:04:52.090]  My family are famous Protestants that literally started Texas.
[02:04:52.090 --> 02:04:54.533]  I mean, right there, starting.
[02:04:54.533 --> 02:04:56.275]  Shipping Protestant Bibles in.
[02:04:56.275 --> 02:04:57.377]  So, those people are liars.
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:06.282]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:05:06.282 --> 02:05:09.564]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:05:09.564 --> 02:05:11.364]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[02:05:11.364 --> 02:05:17.707]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:05:17.707 --> 02:05:23.629]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:05:23.769 --> 02:05:27.732]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:05:27.732 --> 02:05:30.614]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:05:30.614 --> 02:05:39.080]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:41.182]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:05:41.182 --> 02:05:42.223]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:05:42.583 --> 02:05:51.535]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:06:03.419 --> 02:06:05.840]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:14.424]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:06:14.424 --> 02:06:22.388]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic

[02:07:00.171 --> 02:07:04.214]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:07:04.214 --> 02:07:08.577]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:07:08.577 --> 02:07:12.240]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:15.282]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:07:15.282 --> 02:07:22.867]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:07:22.867 --> 02:07:26.510]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:07:26.770 --> 02:07:31.173]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:07:31.173 --> 02:07:37.158]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:37.158 --> 02:07:41.100]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:43.842]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:07:43.842 --> 02:07:45.343]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:45.343 --> 02:07:46.704]  It's time to take action.
[02:07:46.704 --> 02:07:48.526]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:08:08.835 --> 02:08:16.537]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.542 --> 02:08:26.545]  What is the Illuminati?
[02:08:26.545 --> 02:08:30.950]  Who are the practitioners of this ancient faith?
[02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:31.991]  It certainly didn't begin in 1775, 1776.
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.921]  Where is our world going?
[02:08:36.921 --> 02:08:40.122]  How is the Illuminati plan progressing?
[02:08:40.122 --> 02:08:49.887]  We are joined for the rest of the hour by best-selling author, researcher, occult researcher, Jordan Maxwell.
[02:08:49.887 --> 02:08:58.172]  And Jordan Maxwell really is a great political and geopolitical but also esoteric mind.
[02:08:58.172 --> 02:09:04.375]  And I want him today to use a few examples that he brought up to me
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.886]  That people can easily understand of programming in Hollywood and in television.
[02:09:10.886 --> 02:09:19.777]  And then I want to ask him, why do we suddenly see open satanic rituals at the Super Bowl with Madonna and with all the other big
[02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:27.553]  Singers and people, what are they trying to usher in at the Olympics and the rest of it?
[02:09:27.553 --> 02:09:30.414]  Why do they believe ritual is so powerful?
[02:09:30.414 --> 02:09:40.479]  Why do they believe if they tell you in a Tom Clancy book two years before what they actually do, how that lesser magic, as they call it, gives them power?
[02:09:42.011 --> 02:09:44.793]  And you can argue it's really giving them power.
[02:09:44.793 --> 02:09:46.655]  Or is it programming our subconscious?
[02:09:46.655 --> 02:09:47.976]  Is it science?
[02:09:47.976 --> 02:09:49.618]  Or is it a cult?
[02:09:49.618 --> 02:09:52.380]  Do they really believe in spirits at Skull and Bones?
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:55.663]  Or are they using it as an archetype in the Carl Jung way?
[02:09:55.663 --> 02:10:06.673]  Let's just get past all the religious dogma and what men and priests try to say God is, the universe is.
[02:10:06.673 --> 02:10:08.875]  Let's talk about what the elite themselves believe.
[02:10:09.890 --> 02:10:11.691]  I've been to Bohemian Grove infiltrating it.
[02:10:11.691 --> 02:10:13.892]  I'm telling you, they were in religious rapture.
[02:10:13.892 --> 02:10:17.333]  They believe they're worshipping Lucifer.
[02:10:17.333 --> 02:10:20.154]  But are there people above them that are being scientific about it?
[02:10:20.154 --> 02:10:21.134]  What is the internet about?
[02:10:21.134 --> 02:10:36.380]  And this new singularity and the fact that I believe, feeding all of our data into it, the internet is already a AI conscious system because humans are interfacing with it at such a level that it is already conscious and is able to predict the future, which they admit.
[02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:37.860]  They admit it's able to predict the future.
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:38.901]  I call that a being.
[02:10:40.802 --> 02:10:54.306]  Will Lucifer, if it's a real entity from his perspective, become God-like with the artificial, technological, omnipresent system they're building on this planet to be duplicated into space?
[02:10:54.306 --> 02:10:56.047]  Are they building the God-ship?
[02:10:57.045 --> 02:10:58.527]  Now again, this is their view.
[02:10:58.527 --> 02:11:00.450]  I know what their deepest secrets are.
[02:11:00.450 --> 02:11:05.277]  I know Jordan Maxwell has talked to a lot of the highest level initiates of the Illuminati.
[02:11:05.277 --> 02:11:06.699]  And I know he can't talk about a lot of that.
[02:11:06.699 --> 02:11:07.780]  He gets threatened.
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:09.903]  But I want to get his take on it all today.
[02:11:09.903 --> 02:11:12.146]  So Jordan Maxwell, thank you for joining us.
[02:11:12.146 --> 02:11:13.849]  We'll talk more about this later in the hour.
[02:11:16.144 --> 02:11:20.229]  But first, I know there's folks that have websites that aren't yours.
[02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:23.112]  Your official websites have been taken over before.
[02:11:23.112 --> 02:11:28.618]  Up front, give people the real official place people go to find your work.
[02:11:28.618 --> 02:11:31.341]  Because I know a lot's been done to shut your funding off.
[02:11:31.341 --> 02:11:34.885]  It's been rough for you and your family, so I know you don't want to bring this up, but I do.
[02:11:34.885 --> 02:11:36.307]  Up front, how do people support you?
[02:11:36.997 --> 02:11:42.058]  Well, thank you, Alex, for being on the show and always being there as a good friend.
[02:11:42.058 --> 02:11:49.680]  The only place I have on the web now that's legitimately mine is called Jordan Maxwell Show.
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:50.720]  S-H-O-W.
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:51.460]  Very simple.
[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:53.220]  Jordan Maxwell Show.
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:12:00.022]  It's a small podcast that some of my friends helped put together, and so I have at least an email for that.
[02:12:01.443 --> 02:12:04.065]  And so that's the only thing I have at the moment.
[02:12:04.065 --> 02:12:08.069]  I was going good for a while until I got sabotaged.
[02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:17.256]  But if you want to contact me, I'm not allowing any comments to be made because I've got too many negative comments.
[02:12:17.256 --> 02:12:18.898]  Sure, the trolls love to come after you.
[02:12:18.898 --> 02:12:21.160]  I think it's best you just put out your info.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:22.501]  You've been fighting for 60 years.
[02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:24.543]  I think you deserve to just put out your info.
[02:12:25.185 --> 02:12:26.166]  That's what I feel.
[02:12:26.166 --> 02:12:31.572]  I'm tired of struggling to justify myself.
[02:12:31.572 --> 02:12:37.139]  And so I'm tired of my name being ridiculed, my work being ridiculed and sabotaged.
[02:12:37.139 --> 02:12:43.446]  So I just put it out there and I figure whoever's supposed to hear me will and whoever's not supposed to hear me won't.
[02:12:44.082 --> 02:12:46.484]  Well, I just do the best I can under the circumstances.
[02:12:46.484 --> 02:12:49.367]  And folks can find a donate button there to keep the radio show going.
[02:12:49.367 --> 02:12:53.390]  I know you've had health issues and some family has, so it's been rough for you.
[02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:55.872]  Wow, so much going on.
[02:12:55.872 --> 02:12:59.415]  Icon of the Awakening movement, Jordan Maxwell.
[02:12:59.415 --> 02:13:02.118]  You heard my whole preface of what the elite are trying to build.
[02:13:02.118 --> 02:13:03.739]  Who are the Illuminati?
[02:13:03.739 --> 02:13:04.940]  What really makes them tick?
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:06.742]  At their core, what are we facing?
[02:13:07.242 --> 02:13:12.345]  Well, I think you were exactly right when you were talking to the young lady before the break.
[02:13:12.345 --> 02:13:27.293]  The mere fact that the entire world seems to be in the grip of a demonic, otherworldly power which is sucking mankind down into oblivion with demonic depravity, secret societies,
[02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:32.982]  Black robes, all of the occultism of the world is now in your face.
[02:13:32.982 --> 02:13:39.453]  And so I totally agree with you that there is a spiritual dynamics or a matrix at work.
[02:13:40.263 --> 02:13:46.626]  But that being the case, then that would explain why all systems are demonic now.
[02:13:46.626 --> 02:14:00.212]  All of our institutions and governmental agencies, educational systems, are all under some kind of a other world, what I would call demonic and depravity.
[02:14:00.212 --> 02:14:05.274]  And it implies that there's something very, very big going on.
[02:14:05.954 --> 02:14:11.236]  With not just America, but with the whole entire human family on the earth.
[02:14:11.236 --> 02:14:20.661]  And that is frightening because most people have no idea of the severity and the perimeters of how big this thing really is.
[02:14:20.661 --> 02:14:28.304]  It's in banking, it's in religion, government, it is a cancer that's eating up the body politics of the earth, period.
[02:14:29.036 --> 02:14:36.942]  So it is, I believe, a war between the good and evil, between the darkness and light, between God and the devil.
[02:14:36.942 --> 02:14:44.247]  Although I, you know, I've been talking about religion, theology, which is my favorite subject anyway.
[02:14:44.247 --> 02:14:49.291]  But I'm interested also in symbolism and pattern recognition.
[02:14:50.077 --> 02:14:51.197]  Thank you for watching.
[02:15:03.888 --> 02:15:04.689]  Thanks for watching.
[02:15:21.081 --> 02:15:26.348]  That's why he had skull and bones, and this is on record, and a Bohemian Grove.
[02:15:26.348 --> 02:15:34.039]  They have Pirates of the Caribbean iconography in Lafitte's name and literally worship the Pirates of the Caribbean.
[02:15:34.039 --> 02:15:35.061]  Explain why that is.
[02:15:35.563 --> 02:15:43.288]  That's because, first of all, their flag, as you said, is called the Skull and Bones, the Jolly Roger.
[02:15:43.288 --> 02:15:49.471]  It's a black flag, and black also symbolizes the planet Saturn, so we're getting into Saturn.
[02:15:49.471 --> 02:15:51.933]  And the Nazis wore black and wore the skull and bones.
[02:15:52.253 --> 02:15:53.494]  That's it, exactly.
[02:15:53.494 --> 02:16:06.408]  So what we're talking about is an enormous ancient, as you said, ancient system of theology and religion going back into the demonic world, going back into the ancient pagan world.
[02:16:06.408 --> 02:16:08.410]  It's frightening in its implications.
[02:16:08.410 --> 02:16:13.315]  But, so if you understand, well, you know what, let me give you an example first.
[02:16:13.815 --> 02:16:29.950]  That if you have a two-story building and you're going to put a lot of weight on the second floor, the smart thing to do is to go downstairs with a building inspector, get on a ladder, go up and look at the foundation of the floor you're going to build on before you go putting weight on it.
[02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:36.696]  So what you're doing is you're standing under the foundation to see if it's going to hold that kind of weight.
[02:16:36.696 --> 02:16:39.819]  Now you are standing under to get understanding.
[02:16:40.399 --> 02:16:51.222]  So unless you understand how the world works, meaning go down below the surface and see how this stuff really works, not how you thought it worked.
[02:16:51.222 --> 02:17:00.484]  And Pirates of the Caribbean is just an example of how they are pushing the idea of the Knights Templar or the international banking elite.
[02:17:00.484 --> 02:17:10.027]  Why, for instance, is the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue, and remember that word, Internal Revenue,
[02:17:11.167 --> 02:17:12.368]  It's telling you something.
[02:17:12.368 --> 02:17:17.992]  So why is the Federal Reserve and Internal Revenue headquartered in Puerto Rico?
[02:17:17.992 --> 02:17:18.873]  Why?
[02:17:18.873 --> 02:17:25.718]  It's because that's where the pirates of the Caribbean stashed all of their stuff when they were robbing on the heights.
[02:17:25.718 --> 02:17:30.242]  Look at how the globalists are all offshore in the Caribbean and look at the IRS symbol.
[02:17:30.242 --> 02:17:31.683]  It's a hidden symbol.
[02:17:31.683 --> 02:17:32.864]  Somebody thinks it's an eagle?
[02:17:33.604 --> 02:17:35.046]  No, with scales?
[02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:41.452]  No, it's the Egyptian god there with the scales of life hanging over with its hand, holding it.
[02:17:42.131 --> 02:17:43.071]  Absolutely.
[02:17:43.071 --> 02:17:45.853]  You're right, Horace.
[02:17:45.853 --> 02:17:52.575]  I'm fascinated with the idea that you understand the complexity of this because it's very, very big.
[02:17:52.575 --> 02:17:57.717]  Another symbol that's very important, the dollar sign, the symbol for money.
[02:17:57.717 --> 02:18:00.058]  It's a little S with a line through it.
[02:18:00.058 --> 02:18:02.199]  Sometimes it's an S with two lines through it.
[02:18:02.199 --> 02:18:03.320]  You know what I'm talking about?
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:07.682]  The symbol for the dollar symbol?
[02:18:07.682 --> 02:18:10.723]  Well, the I going through the S, the I represents
[02:18:12.063 --> 02:18:13.604]  Uh, insurance.
[02:18:13.604 --> 02:18:17.207]  And the S is for, uh, script.
[02:18:17.207 --> 02:18:20.449]  So the I-S is insurance script.
[02:18:20.449 --> 02:18:22.591]  It goes back to the 14th Amendment.
[02:18:22.591 --> 02:18:24.312]  It goes back to 1870.
[02:18:24.312 --> 02:18:29.896]  It can even go back further when you understand, uh, Lorenzo Tonti.
[02:18:29.896 --> 02:18:30.977]  Remember that name?
[02:18:30.977 --> 02:18:32.218]  Lorenzo Tonti.
[02:18:32.218 --> 02:18:33.339]  T-O-N-T-I.
[02:18:34.446 --> 02:18:59.544]  Lorenzo Tonti was a man, he was an Italian-born French banker who gave us the conceptual idea of Tontine Insurance, which is spelled T-O-N-T-I-N-E, insurance, Tontine, which was the idea developed in the 1700s with the common banking system, one common banking system for everyone.
[02:19:00.064 --> 02:19:00.645]  We're good to go.
[02:19:16.238 --> 02:19:18.399]  Which gives us that word communism.
[02:19:18.399 --> 02:19:20.500]  It means a master contract, a tanting.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:21.181]  That's it.
[02:19:21.181 --> 02:19:22.402]  That's exactly right.
[02:19:22.402 --> 02:19:35.069]  And so once you begin to see how tantine insurance is connected to international banking, the common fund, central bank, then you take it to the next level, a central bank for the world.
[02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:36.930]  Well, the whole earth.
[02:19:36.930 --> 02:19:41.533]  So all of this stuff has been planned a long time ago, as you say.
[02:19:41.533 --> 02:19:49.659]  And another classic example in Hollywood for the movies and television shows today dealing with zombies.
[02:19:49.659 --> 02:19:50.280]  Why?
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:59.746]  It's because in America, in North America, and most likely throughout the rest of the world, in all counties, and everybody on our earth is in a county.
[02:19:59.746 --> 02:20:01.928]  I don't care where you go on the earth.
[02:20:02.348 --> 02:20:03.370]  We're good to go.
[02:20:20.185 --> 02:20:26.850]  You have something called Cemetery Law, which in all counties, the land is under Cemetery Law.
[02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:34.837]  And so it doesn't matter if it's commercial or residential, Cemetery Law is the law of properties and real estate.
[02:20:35.470 --> 02:20:43.839]  And so if you are the only kind of people that are walking around talking in cemeteries and living in cemeteries are zombies.
[02:20:43.839 --> 02:20:50.967]  So what Hollywood is trying to tell you and tell the world all over the world, they're telling you, you are zombies.
[02:20:50.967 --> 02:20:53.250]  You're walking around dead.
[02:20:53.250 --> 02:20:54.251]  You know nothing.
[02:20:54.251 --> 02:20:55.573]  You understand nothing.
[02:20:55.573 --> 02:20:56.494]  You've got nothing.
[02:20:57.134 --> 02:20:59.415]  What little bit you have, we're taking from you.
[02:20:59.415 --> 02:21:00.656]  Your masters are taking from you.
[02:21:00.656 --> 02:21:06.119]  And by the way, the military, marines and soldiers are now taught the public are zombies when they practice mowing everyone down.
[02:21:06.119 --> 02:21:11.042]  I just showed mainstream news, so that when they really mow us down, well, we're just zombies.
[02:21:11.042 --> 02:21:13.323]  It's dehumanizing an enemy.
[02:21:13.323 --> 02:21:15.024]  You have to dehumanize an enemy.
[02:21:15.024 --> 02:21:18.426]  So we're being globally taught humans are ugly, gross, bad.
[02:21:18.426 --> 02:21:20.687]  Abortions are beautiful.
[02:21:20.687 --> 02:21:22.448]  It's like giving birth to kill your baby.
[02:21:22.448 --> 02:21:25.570]  Have you seen that new video put out by the Planned Parenthood people?
[02:21:26.281 --> 02:21:27.862]  Oh, God, no.
[02:21:27.862 --> 02:21:29.242]  It's like giving birth.
[02:21:29.242 --> 02:21:31.723]  I have a photo of the baby before they chopped it up.
[02:21:31.723 --> 02:21:34.584]  Oh, total Satanism, inverting it.
[02:21:34.584 --> 02:21:37.545]  It's not real Satanism running around a black club and chopping a baby.
[02:21:37.545 --> 02:21:38.565]  That's only partial.
[02:21:38.565 --> 02:21:46.908]  To say it's beautiful and wonderful like a Hillbop cult member, that is to them true Luciferianism.
[02:21:46.908 --> 02:21:47.328]  But go ahead.
[02:21:47.828 --> 02:21:49.688]  Boy, you are absolutely correct.
[02:21:49.688 --> 02:22:02.491]  And as I said, this seems to be a worldwide phenomena based on ancient occultism, which can be traced directly back to demonism, devil worship, satanic worship.
[02:22:02.491 --> 02:22:14.133]  All of this is... And even when you deal with the word Satan, it can be traced back to Saturn and Saturnian worship.
[02:22:14.133 --> 02:22:16.273]  Tell us about the ancient worshippers of Saturn.
[02:22:16.943 --> 02:22:24.188]  Yeah, Saturn is very, very important because that's another symbol in Hollywood that's in your face.
[02:22:24.188 --> 02:22:26.609]  The ancient worshippers of Saturn.
[02:22:26.609 --> 02:22:30.252]  Saturn was referred to as the inhibitor.
[02:22:30.252 --> 02:22:33.194]  He was lord of the rings.
[02:22:33.194 --> 02:22:36.296]  Well, of course Saturn is lord of the rings.
[02:22:36.296 --> 02:22:41.880]  And he creates one system to bind everyone into him in the chains.
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:43.901]  So the rings are the chains, correct?
[02:22:43.901 --> 02:22:45.162]  That's exactly right.
[02:22:45.162 --> 02:22:46.843]  And that's why in the ancient world,
[02:22:47.143 --> 02:22:47.523]  We're good.
[02:23:05.575 --> 02:23:08.376]  And in Hollywood, of course, you have Lord of the Rings.
[02:23:08.376 --> 02:23:11.076]  They're telling you something with Lord of the Rings.
[02:23:11.076 --> 02:23:13.957]  One of the movies was called Two Towers.
[02:23:13.957 --> 02:23:17.917]  You need to understand that there's a... That's totally Masonic!
[02:23:17.917 --> 02:23:25.919]  Totally, totally demonic and depravity and people have no idea in the world how deep this stuff really goes.
[02:23:25.919 --> 02:23:27.159]  But you see it.
[02:23:27.159 --> 02:23:31.220]  You know, if you're trained to see something, it's very quick to pick it up.
[02:23:31.220 --> 02:23:32.360]  Well, it's like once you know what...
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:38.726]  Ancient symbols mean you can suddenly read the hieroglyphs, but if you don't know, it's a bunch of gibberish.
[02:23:38.726 --> 02:23:42.530]  We've learned, you know, how to read their hieroglyphs, and it's everywhere.
[02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:44.873]  Their gang signs are everywhere.
[02:23:44.873 --> 02:23:46.475]  Absolutely, no doubt about it.
[02:23:46.475 --> 02:23:48.718]  They're banking, educational.
[02:23:48.718 --> 02:23:53.623]  I mean, even in the ancient Roman Empire, they had a tremendous sewer.
[02:23:54.364 --> 02:23:55.125]  Let me ask you this.
[02:23:55.125 --> 02:23:58.188]  Everyone comes to the conclusion, whether it's biblical, you name it,
[02:24:16.886 --> 02:24:17.026]  Yes.
[02:24:32.926 --> 02:24:36.068]  You get to the level of understanding that is a spirit.
[02:24:36.068 --> 02:24:44.453]  It is a dimensional program that is literally guiding humans as agents to the one ring.
[02:24:44.453 --> 02:24:59.783]  And then we've all been given in the system, whether we want to be part of it or not, our own little rings, our own little cell phones, our own little systems, little microcosms of the larger one, where we are bound to it, where even if our spirit resonates against it, it doesn't matter.
[02:24:59.783 --> 02:25:01.945]  We were brought up within the chains of it.
[02:25:02.565 --> 02:25:04.186]  Absolutely, no doubt about it.
[02:25:04.186 --> 02:25:15.612]  That's why children, when a baby is born, before the baby leaves the hospital, they want to take a print of its feet.
[02:25:15.612 --> 02:25:17.613]  You ever seen that, Alex?
[02:25:17.613 --> 02:25:20.614]  Yeah, that's sent off for collateral on the IMF and World Bank.
[02:25:20.614 --> 02:25:23.816]  That's exactly what it is, so that they are taking your soul.
[02:25:24.756 --> 02:25:25.016]  Thank you.
[02:25:41.493 --> 02:25:46.774]  5,000-year-old Babylonian symbol, Egyptian, the double helix snake for medicine.
[02:25:46.774 --> 02:25:51.935]  You look at 1855, the British royalty publicly funds millions of pounds.
[02:25:51.935 --> 02:25:53.896]  At that time, it's like billions today.
[02:25:53.896 --> 02:25:57.477]  They said, you will discover the DNA, you will discover the biometrics.
[02:25:57.477 --> 02:26:01.998]  They knew the secrets before they'd been developed by science.
[02:26:01.998 --> 02:26:04.038]  That's other world intelligence, isn't it?
[02:26:04.438 --> 02:26:32.827]  Absolutely, and from there you could go to all of the different temples that are found in the oceans of the world, off the coast of Cuba, off the coast of Okinawa, all of the different temples, as I said, underwater, all of the strange pyramids around the globe, and so all of this implies a higher intelligence has been on this earth for many, many thousands of years that we've never been told, and that there's something very evil
[02:26:34.048 --> 02:26:45.573]  Coming this way and it's ultimately to destroy the human race as a such and make the whole human race into some sort of a computerized unit.
[02:26:45.573 --> 02:26:58.259]  And I totally agree with you and I say it again with the assessment that you had before with the young lady when you talked about, well, it's not one, it's many, it's evil, period, on the earth, period.
[02:26:58.849 --> 02:27:01.572]  It has nothing to do with one particular group.
[02:27:01.572 --> 02:27:05.536]  I have been looking at all of these groups since 1959.
[02:27:05.536 --> 02:27:19.490]  I am partial to looking at the Vatican because behind the Vatican, the Vatican was one of the first corporations on the earth and it gave to the British the idea of corporations from the corporations in Britain.
[02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:21.571]  That's exactly right.
[02:27:21.571 --> 02:27:24.893]  And that's why the whole idea today, the way it works,
[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:45.347]  It's been refined and mutated so that today, you yourself, your wife and your children are a corporation.
[02:27:45.347 --> 02:27:52.193]  You are a, you know, for instance, if I see you with some girl and I say, you know Alex, that girl is bad company.
[02:27:52.193 --> 02:27:55.676]  And you say, you need to mind your own business.
[02:27:55.676 --> 02:27:58.438]  She's going to be my wife, she's going to be my partner.
[02:27:58.438 --> 02:28:01.640]  And I'm saying, wait a minute, partner, business, company?
[02:28:02.341 --> 02:28:03.742]  You're talking corporations.
[02:28:03.742 --> 02:28:04.442]  Ventures?
[02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:07.884]  Yeah, and then so when you die, you're a corpse.
[02:28:07.884 --> 02:28:08.164]  Why?
[02:28:08.164 --> 02:28:10.405]  Because you're a corporation.
[02:28:10.405 --> 02:28:20.049]  And there's, you know, that gets into maritime property law and how many, it gets also into the fact that there's two of everything.
[02:28:20.049 --> 02:28:21.089]  You ask, you ask,
[02:28:22.350 --> 02:28:26.993]  I asked people, how many states are in the Federal Union of the United States?
[02:28:26.993 --> 02:28:29.055]  And they would tell you 50 if they're smart.
[02:28:29.055 --> 02:28:31.136]  Most of them say more than that.
[02:28:31.136 --> 02:28:32.637]  But 50 states?
[02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:34.279]  No, that's not correct.
[02:28:34.279 --> 02:28:37.781]  It's 100 states are in our union.
[02:28:37.781 --> 02:28:40.123]  Because every state is two states.
[02:28:41.167 --> 02:28:45.551]  Every state, you have California State or Cal State or New York State.
[02:28:45.551 --> 02:28:49.736]  And that's why they break it into 10 FEMA regions and 10 kingdoms.
[02:28:49.736 --> 02:28:52.579]  The UN even uses the revelation terminology.
[02:28:52.579 --> 02:28:53.880]  That's exactly right.
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:29:04.831]  So as I said, it's an incredible development in human history that evil has now dominated the entire planet.
[02:29:05.606 --> 02:29:09.989]  And that the, uh, the method of today, uh, lies, deception.
[02:29:09.989 --> 02:29:16.313]  But the reason it works so well is because it has, I believe, outside intervention.
[02:29:16.313 --> 02:29:19.195]  We have outside help from off-world.
[02:29:19.195 --> 02:29:20.816]  Demonic, demonic providence.
[02:29:20.816 --> 02:29:22.657]  Stay there, Jordan Maxwell.
[02:29:22.657 --> 02:29:24.598]  You're gonna have a couple minute break after the break.
[02:29:24.598 --> 02:29:27.020]  We're gonna premiere a special
[02:29:28.885 --> 02:29:29.885]  I don't even know what to call it.
[02:29:29.885 --> 02:29:34.086]  Minifilm from They Live 2014.
[02:29:34.086 --> 02:29:38.487]  And then in mere minutes after it airs here, it's going to go up on InfoWars.com.
[02:29:38.487 --> 02:29:43.768]  Very powerful tool to get people to come out of the Matrix to wake up with Rowdy Piper.
[02:29:43.768 --> 02:29:45.729]  So we'll be back after the break.
[02:29:45.729 --> 02:29:47.749]  A few minute clip and then back to Jordan Maxwell.
[02:29:47.749 --> 02:29:49.349]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:50.750]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:53.270]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:55.971]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.171 --> 02:30:07.439]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:30:07.439 --> 02:30:09.822]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:30:09.822 --> 02:30:15.167]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:15.167 --> 02:30:20.253]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:30:20.393 --> 02:30:23.776]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:23.776 --> 02:30:27.919]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:27.919 --> 02:30:32.322]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:32.322 --> 02:30:42.670]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:42.670 --> 02:30:46.913]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[02:30:47.133 --> 02:30:53.739]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:30:53.739 --> 02:30:58.703]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:30:58.703 --> 02:31:10.774]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:31:10.774 --> 02:31:12.636]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:31:12.836 --> 02:31:13.716]  Fluoride.
[02:31:13.716 --> 02:31:16.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:31:16.137 --> 02:31:22.199]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:31:22.199 --> 02:31:25.139]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:31:25.139 --> 02:31:27.120]  And the results are on record.
[02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:33.442]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:31:33.442 --> 02:31:35.862]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:31:35.862 --> 02:31:38.783]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:31:38.783 --> 02:31:42.184]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:31:42.304 --> 02:31:47.369]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:47.369 --> 02:31:52.834]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[02:31:52.834 --> 02:31:54.035]  I take it every day.
[02:31:54.035 --> 02:31:56.897]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:00.259 --> 02:32:08.388]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[02:32:08.388 --> 02:32:10.611]  All the major networks are state-run.
[02:32:10.611 --> 02:32:13.314]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[02:32:13.314 --> 02:32:17.739]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[02:32:17.739 --> 02:32:20.742]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[02:32:20.742 --> 02:32:28.373]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:32:28.373 --> 02:32:32.679]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:32:32.679 --> 02:32:34.481]  We are the true media.
[02:32:34.481 --> 02:32:37.085]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[02:32:37.145 --> 02:32:40.908]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[02:33:01.391 --> 02:33:06.915]  I feel like this all the time, trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda.
[02:33:06.915 --> 02:33:07.956]  It's not left or right.
[02:33:07.956 --> 02:33:10.417]  It's, hey, there's mind control going on.
[02:33:10.417 --> 02:33:13.940]  The signal's broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media.
[02:33:13.940 --> 02:33:16.922]  Just become aware of it, and they'll say, there's nothing going on.
[02:33:16.922 --> 02:33:20.825]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete!
[02:33:26.457 --> 02:33:32.020]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
[02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:34.761]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful!
[02:33:34.761 --> 02:33:37.442]  And they have blinded us to the truth!
[02:33:37.442 --> 02:33:40.444]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[02:33:40.444 --> 02:33:43.385]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[02:33:43.385 --> 02:33:46.346]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[02:33:46.346 --> 02:33:51.589]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[02:33:51.969 --> 02:33:58.573]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation.
[02:33:58.573 --> 02:34:08.699]  Outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us, from birth to death, are our owners!
[02:34:08.699 --> 02:34:15.584]  Latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today.
[02:34:16.064 --> 02:34:26.793]  Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
[02:34:26.793 --> 02:34:38.463]  The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[02:34:38.463 --> 02:34:42.126]  But for the first time in all of human history,
[02:34:44.588 --> 02:34:47.211]  Mankind is politically awakened.
[02:34:47.211 --> 02:34:49.833]  That's a total new reality.
[02:34:49.833 --> 02:34:52.716]  I've got one that can see.
[02:34:52.716 --> 02:34:54.117]  We can't be the only ones who can see.
[02:34:54.117 --> 02:35:05.048]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root of all our problems.
[02:35:05.905 --> 02:35:08.067]  It's a new morning in America.
[02:35:08.067 --> 02:35:08.988]  Fresh.
[02:35:08.988 --> 02:35:09.989]  Vital.
[02:35:09.989 --> 02:35:12.291]  The old cynicism is gone.
[02:35:12.291 --> 02:35:14.813]  We have faith in our leaders.
[02:35:14.813 --> 02:35:19.196]  We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
[02:35:19.196 --> 02:35:22.960]  It really boils down to our ability to accept.
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:25.001]  We don't need pessimism.
[02:35:25.001 --> 02:35:27.884]  I have two words for you.
[02:35:27.884 --> 02:35:28.745]  Predator drums.
[02:35:35.296 --> 02:35:37.220]  You will never see it coming.
[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:45.515]  I'm predicting the first guy who uses a Second Amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in a second.
[02:35:49.431 --> 02:35:53.834]  We broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[02:35:53.834 --> 02:35:59.798]  I'm just trying to warn you folks that television is a giant LED weapon system.
[02:35:59.798 --> 02:36:01.639]  It's so advanced.
[02:36:01.639 --> 02:36:03.540]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks.
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:07.703]  They do all sorts of testing on great apes, rhesus monkeys, the whole nine yards.
[02:36:07.703 --> 02:36:14.847]  And they go, oh, you didn't see this, and punch a button and it'd be hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them.
[02:36:14.847 --> 02:36:16.949]  All I ever have to do is be famous.
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:21.383]  People watch me, and they love me.
[02:36:21.383 --> 02:36:23.485]  You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
[02:36:23.485 --> 02:36:24.566]  I know you want it.
[02:36:24.566 --> 02:36:26.428]  Hell, everybody does.
[02:36:26.428 --> 02:36:28.850]  Do it to your own kind.
[02:36:28.850 --> 02:36:30.372]  What's the threat?
[02:36:30.372 --> 02:36:32.033]  We all sell out every day.
[02:36:32.033 --> 02:36:33.995]  Might as well be on the winning team.
[02:36:33.995 --> 02:36:41.523]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[02:36:43.334 --> 02:36:45.294]  And I'm all out of bubble gum.
[02:36:45.294 --> 02:36:49.035]  Time to take a stand, boys.
[02:36:49.035 --> 02:36:49.895]  You know what?
[02:36:49.895 --> 02:36:51.416]  You got a little courage.
[02:36:51.416 --> 02:36:54.657]  Stand up for yourself.
[02:36:54.657 --> 02:36:57.297]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:36:57.297 --> 02:37:03.839]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:37:03.839 --> 02:37:07.679]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat.
[02:37:07.679 --> 02:37:10.420]  Long live the Republic!
[02:37:18.263 --> 02:37:24.146]  Alright, folks, and that video just went live as we aired it here on the Radio Slash TV Show.
[02:37:24.146 --> 02:37:27.308]  If you're a radio listener and want to see the video, it's really powerful.
[02:37:27.308 --> 02:37:30.570]  The audio's powerful, but it's ten times more powerful, the video.
[02:37:30.570 --> 02:37:32.831]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:37:32.831 --> 02:37:34.892]  We just tweeted it out at RealAlexJones.
[02:37:34.892 --> 02:37:35.993]  Please retweet it.
[02:37:35.993 --> 02:37:36.913]  They Live Trailer 2014.
[02:37:39.369 --> 02:37:45.352]  Recent real world news meshes with 1980s cult classic John Carpenter's They Live.
[02:37:45.352 --> 02:37:52.556]  Great job McBreen, Rob Dew, and I contributed to the report as well.
[02:37:52.556 --> 02:37:54.857]  So great job to everybody getting that up.
[02:37:54.857 --> 02:37:56.978]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:37:56.978 --> 02:37:57.779]  And prison!
[02:37:59.093 --> 02:38:01.874]  Planet.com right now.
[02:38:01.874 --> 02:38:05.694]  Now giving him the floor, he may even do some overdrive with us today if he has the energy.
[02:38:05.694 --> 02:38:07.375]  He's on fire today.
[02:38:07.375 --> 02:38:14.696]  Jordan Maxwell, I've been throwing in some points, adding to what you're saying, but I'm going to try to, as much as I can, sit back and have you get into more.
[02:38:14.696 --> 02:38:17.076]  You started getting into the Vatican, talk about that if you'd like.
[02:38:17.076 --> 02:38:21.097]  The EU, Russia, where you see the world going.
[02:38:21.097 --> 02:38:23.518]  And again, who are the Illuminati?
[02:38:23.518 --> 02:38:25.058]  Obviously you're saying it's an off-world
[02:38:26.823 --> 02:38:32.865]  Spirit and entity, the Bible, it's the devil, others it's... I mean clearly every culture said this.
[02:38:32.865 --> 02:38:35.206]  Clearly we're in the middle of deep space.
[02:38:35.206 --> 02:38:53.951]  I was thinking about how there's a parasite, in fact you guys were going to print me that Wikipedia on it, that cats have, and I was reading how a third of the world is infected with it, and how it's a microscopic amoeba, that's where you get the term crazy cat lady,
[02:38:55.339 --> 02:39:20.257]  that literally programs you to like the smell of cats and cat pee so you will keep the cats around you and there's another similar amoeba that gets into snails and reprograms its brain to go up to the top of trees and commit suicide where birds are so it'll be eaten so that more of the birds crap it out that's then eaten by the snail now even amoeba
[02:39:21.308 --> 02:39:34.273]  And I'm really going to do some big reports on this because it's an example of like, under the skin for real or something like that sci-fi movie, that what else is there in this universe we don't know about that amoebas infect one-third of Earth?
[02:39:34.273 --> 02:39:37.675]  In fact, some numbers are 40%.
[02:39:37.675 --> 02:39:40.096]  I'll show people the amoeba right here.
[02:39:40.096 --> 02:39:43.577]  It's Toxoplasmosis, am I pronouncing that right?
[02:39:43.577 --> 02:39:45.578]  Parasitic disease, including humans.
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:49.862]  And we can actually show people shots of it, a tiny fluke.
[02:39:49.862 --> 02:39:54.406]  Up to a third of the world's human population is estimated to carry an infection.
[02:39:54.406 --> 02:40:07.035]  It kills some people, but most people are just irritable, aggressive, but again, want more cats, and it programs you to want to have the smell of cat urine around.
[02:40:07.035 --> 02:40:15.061]  Now imagine an amoeba that programs the human brain to want to have more cats around so that you can continue spreading the infection.
[02:40:16.237 --> 02:40:16.958]  This is on record.
[02:40:16.958 --> 02:40:20.540]  Cat Poop, Parasites, May Post, Public Health Hazard, Studies Suggest, NBC.
[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:21.941]  May Post?
[02:40:21.941 --> 02:40:23.062]  Maybe the angels were right.
[02:40:23.062 --> 02:40:24.203]  Don't have cats around.
[02:40:24.203 --> 02:40:25.784]  Where did this start?
[02:40:25.784 --> 02:40:34.630]  Egypt took a Nile cat that was wild and bred it as a small cat, a little bit bigger than a house cat, and bred into the cats we have today.
[02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:36.252]  I'm not on a jihad against cats, folks.
[02:40:36.892 --> 02:40:47.560]  I'm just telling you that it is a parasite carrying, might as well be carrying a space alien, folks, that literally takes over your brain, lowers your IQ, and makes you a servant of the cat.
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:48.721]  Okay?
[02:40:48.721 --> 02:40:50.903]  And this is the way this works.
[02:40:50.903 --> 02:40:51.503]  Yeah, they found it.
[02:40:51.503 --> 02:40:53.565]  That's the original Egyptian cat.
[02:40:53.565 --> 02:40:57.228]  And so the Egyptians were totally insane, infected by this, worshipping cats.
[02:40:58.069 --> 02:41:07.955]  And again, I don't know how this fits in, I'm just saying my gut tells me it hooks into a lot more about what, this is a physical parasite no one seems to know about.
[02:41:07.955 --> 02:41:13.238]  And that literally causes massive brain damage in millions of children worldwide every year.
[02:41:13.238 --> 02:41:15.759]  And all sorts of autism, the list goes on and on.
[02:41:15.759 --> 02:41:19.221]  And imagine what other parasites there are we don't know about.
[02:41:19.221 --> 02:41:21.203]  Spiritual, dimensional parasites.
[02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:24.632]  Am I going in the right direction, Jordan Maxwell?
[02:41:24.632 --> 02:41:25.793]  Absolutely.
[02:41:25.793 --> 02:41:29.816]  Couldn't agree with you more, and I was going to throw in that about Egypt.
[02:41:29.816 --> 02:41:40.884]  The continual, perpetual worship of the cat, and we've had movies of cat gods, and all of this having to do with cats and animals in general.
[02:41:42.073 --> 02:41:42.794]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:41:42.794 --> 02:41:48.898]  There is some sort of a legitimate de jure magical system at work.
[02:41:48.898 --> 02:41:56.063]  And the technologies that we have today, look at what we've come in the past 100 years.
[02:41:56.063 --> 02:42:00.586]  And I often think, where did all of this high technology come from?
[02:42:00.586 --> 02:42:05.429]  I am totally convinced of my own because of things that should happen to me.
[02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:07.871]  I'm totally convinced that we are being fed
[02:42:08.512 --> 02:42:09.294]  We're good to go.
[02:42:18.953 --> 02:42:26.420]  Because we're on the edge of oblivion with our technology and Holly was even telling you that in movies.
[02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:41.333]  So why did we get so far and so deep into the occult world and 100 years with our technology unless somebody is feeding it to us knowing full well what they have in mind for the human family.
[02:42:41.773 --> 02:42:43.694]  We're like goldfish in a bowl.
[02:42:43.694 --> 02:42:51.137]  Somebody's sitting out there watching us and leading the whole human race into its downfall.
[02:42:51.137 --> 02:42:59.301]  So I have the highest of admiration for God, for the concepts of spirituality, for the divine presence in the universe.
[02:42:59.301 --> 02:43:09.205]  I have no respect for the systems of education, the media, religion, the organized religions.
[02:43:10.086 --> 02:43:18.319]  I'm just telling you there's something very big going on that is implying other world interference.
[02:43:18.319 --> 02:43:24.229]  This is why I said to before Alex that people talk about evolution.
[02:43:25.026 --> 02:43:27.687]  I think the word is intervention.
[02:43:27.687 --> 02:43:33.130]  I think if you go back, you'll begin to see that we've been messed with a long time ago.
[02:43:33.130 --> 02:43:34.531]  Well, that's what the Bible says.
[02:43:34.531 --> 02:43:35.932]  That's what Genesis says.
[02:43:35.932 --> 02:43:37.113]  That's exactly right.
[02:43:37.113 --> 02:43:40.214]  And I talked with rabbis about this back in 1960.
[02:43:44.767 --> 02:43:53.972]  And so, that's a whole subject that we got into, just on the biblical implications of who created us and where we came from.
[02:43:53.972 --> 02:44:11.362]  And I remember asking a rabbi, a high-ranking rabbi in America, back in the 60s, if, I said, in Genesis 9-1, it talks about Noah, after the flood of Noah's day, when everyone was killed off by the great flood.
[02:44:11.362 --> 02:44:13.503]  It says that when Noah came off the ark,
[02:44:14.031 --> 02:44:19.676]  God said to him and his family, go forth, multiply, and replenish the earth.
[02:44:19.676 --> 02:44:28.623]  And I asked the rabbis at that time, there was more than one, it was a group of them, and I said, is that a correct translation, replenish the earth?
[02:44:28.623 --> 02:44:30.184]  Being re means do again.
[02:44:32.043 --> 02:44:33.623]  And they said, yes, that's correct.
[02:44:33.623 --> 02:44:37.384]  It says redo, obviously, if there were people here.
[02:44:37.384 --> 02:44:39.385]  The flood killed off everyone.
[02:44:39.385 --> 02:44:43.165]  If God wants people on the earth, then you have to replenish the earth.
[02:44:43.165 --> 02:44:43.906]  I said, fine.
[02:44:43.906 --> 02:44:46.766]  Then what about Genesis 1, 28?
[02:44:46.766 --> 02:44:50.447]  When God is creating Adam and Eve, and he says exactly the same thing.
[02:44:50.447 --> 02:44:54.068]  Go forth, multiply, and replenish the earth.
[02:44:54.068 --> 02:44:54.888]  Do it again.
[02:44:55.931 --> 02:45:00.454]  And they looked at me and they said, well, obviously because Adam and Eve's not the first creatures.
[02:45:00.454 --> 02:45:02.596]  Another creation before it.
[02:45:02.596 --> 02:45:03.776]  That's exactly right.
[02:45:03.776 --> 02:45:06.798]  We have something called pre-idemic man.
[02:45:06.798 --> 02:45:13.663]  Look it up and you begin to see that there's a world of knowledge that you have not been told about this earth.
[02:45:13.663 --> 02:45:20.608]  And that would explain all of the great temples and all the great, uh, you know, that's the thing.
[02:45:20.608 --> 02:45:23.730]  The atheists and people look at the Bible and they say, oh, look, it's kooky.
[02:45:23.730 --> 02:45:25.551]  One man and one woman replenish the earth.
[02:45:26.491 --> 02:45:29.833]  No, it was people perfect in their generations that hadn't had their genetics manipulated.
[02:45:29.833 --> 02:45:31.414]  Of course there was stuff going on.
[02:45:31.414 --> 02:45:40.600]  And it's all preachers, the last 200 years, who were scared of science and everything, distorting what the Bible really says, and then discrediting it.
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:41.960]  It's incredible.
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:45.242]  Absolutely incredible, because it's all there.
[02:45:46.866 --> 02:45:52.869]  And another thing, once again in the Bible, I'm fascinated with the stuff that's there right in your face.
[02:45:52.869 --> 02:46:00.312]  Genesis 1-2 says, and the earth, you know, Genesis 1-1 says, in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
[02:46:00.312 --> 02:46:04.854]  But Genesis 1-2 says, and the earth was without form and void.
[02:46:05.871 --> 02:46:08.853]  Without form and void, logic alone would dictate.
[02:46:08.853 --> 02:46:09.773]  What are you talking about?
[02:46:09.773 --> 02:46:13.355]  God has created something but it has no form and it's void?
[02:46:13.355 --> 02:46:14.376]  What are you talking about?
[02:46:14.376 --> 02:46:15.756]  It's digital.
[02:46:15.756 --> 02:46:16.257]  It's data.
[02:46:16.257 --> 02:46:21.579]  He's formed it as a blueprint but has not actually built it.
[02:46:21.579 --> 02:46:22.120]  Yes.
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:31.364]  And so we find that the words that are translated into English, you know, the English translators were very good with the King's English.
[02:46:31.364 --> 02:46:34.066]  They weren't that hot with Greek and Hebrew back then.
[02:46:34.608 --> 02:46:43.139]  So we now know that the words that were translated without form and void was in Hebrew, Tohu Vavohu.
[02:46:43.139 --> 02:46:49.828]  Tohu Vavohu is correctly translated, not without form and void.
[02:46:50.629 --> 02:46:57.152]  But has become, became, the earth became a waste and a desolation.
[02:46:57.152 --> 02:47:07.876]  That's very important because if you go back to Jeremiah, the fourth chapter, and read where Jeremiah says, I was on my bed and God gave me a vision.
[02:47:07.876 --> 02:47:13.858]  And I saw, God gave me the vision and I saw the earth when it was a meeting place for the gods.
[02:47:13.858 --> 02:47:16.699]  It was a meeting place for the Elohim, the gods.
[02:47:17.439 --> 02:47:29.405]  And there was no man found on the earth, but there were beautiful cities, there were beautiful animals, and then he says, in Jeremiah, he says, I saw Tohu Vavohu.
[02:47:29.405 --> 02:47:32.286]  That's the second time that term is used.
[02:47:32.286 --> 02:47:40.050]  And so what he's saying is, I saw the earth when it was a beautiful meeting place of the gods, it was beautiful animals, great cities.
[02:47:40.050 --> 02:47:41.631]  But saw it again when it was overwritten.
[02:47:42.351 --> 02:47:50.661]  Exactly, and then he says, I saw Tohu Vavohu, meaning, and it became a waste and a desolation.
[02:47:50.661 --> 02:47:58.130]  Became, that was, well, not formed without form and void, no, became a waste and a desolation.
[02:47:58.797 --> 02:48:00.399]  That means something.
[02:48:00.399 --> 02:48:11.435]  The Bible is telling you that there have been ancient, ancient civilizations here, many, many thousands, if not far, far more than that, going back millions of years.
[02:48:11.435 --> 02:48:14.820]  There's a history to this earth that we have not been privy to know about.
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:26.249]  Not only the elite believe that, and they believe they're worshipping these gods and goddesses that they believe are entities, whether this is all real or not, the elite believe it, and the systems of control they've gotten have put them in control.
[02:48:26.249 --> 02:48:29.912]  On average, what are the different stratas of the different Illuminati cults?
[02:48:29.912 --> 02:48:34.476]  I mean, at rock bottom, most of them are just servants of power and lust after power.
[02:48:34.476 --> 02:48:35.837]  I would say it's kind of Satanist.
[02:48:36.966 --> 02:48:38.868]  Yeah, I totally agree with you.
[02:48:38.868 --> 02:48:44.234]  It's just the fallacy of being human.
[02:48:44.234 --> 02:48:49.519]  Because the scripture talks about there's a war going on between our members.
[02:48:49.519 --> 02:48:54.585]  The Apostle Paul talked about there's a war going on in our members between good and evil.
[02:48:54.585 --> 02:48:56.787]  And that has to do with Armageddon.
[02:48:56.787 --> 02:48:58.549]  We can get into that one of these days.
[02:48:59.150 --> 02:49:02.833]  And the number 666, and what that actually, in fact, means.
[02:49:02.833 --> 02:49:05.435]  Explain what 666 means.
[02:49:05.435 --> 02:49:09.478]  It's too big of a subject to get into right now.
[02:49:09.478 --> 02:49:12.821]  It's the sun god calculation, isn't it, for the Egyptian temple?
[02:49:12.821 --> 02:49:16.984]  Yeah, that's one of the applications of it, yeah.
[02:49:16.984 --> 02:49:20.807]  But let you have understanding, reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, 666.
[02:49:20.807 --> 02:49:28.053]  I mean, just give us a small quantify from your research, what 666 means to the initiates of the Illuminati.
[02:49:28.584 --> 02:49:33.946]  Well, it simply means that we humans are the beast.
[02:49:33.946 --> 02:49:39.547]  It's a revelation when you understand that we humans are the beast of revelation.
[02:49:39.547 --> 02:49:47.430]  And it has to do with the war going on inside of us between God and the devil, between good and evil, between light and darkness.
[02:49:49.071 --> 02:49:53.497]  Let he who hath understanding reckon the number, for it is the number of a man.
[02:49:53.497 --> 02:49:54.218]  It's telling us.
[02:49:54.218 --> 02:49:54.858]  Precisely.
[02:49:54.858 --> 02:49:56.781]  That's exactly right.
[02:49:56.781 --> 02:49:59.464]  We could talk about that on another program.
[02:49:59.464 --> 02:50:07.314]  Get into the really esoteric, illuminati interpretation of scripture and how it's being used in government.
[02:50:10.055 --> 02:50:21.398]  What does it mean to say we're made in the image of the Creator, and then if we're 666 and that's the Sun God, is it saying it's the war by Lucifer to suppress us?
[02:50:21.398 --> 02:50:27.580]  Not from the New Age sense of becoming gods, but realizing that we are almost the nanotech of God?
[02:50:28.809 --> 02:50:30.831]  Alright, listen.
[02:50:30.831 --> 02:50:37.436]  One of the highest ranking rabbis I was privileged to meet back in the 60s, we had a long conversation about that.
[02:50:37.436 --> 02:50:41.879]  And he said, nowhere in the Bible does it say God created man.
[02:50:41.879 --> 02:50:42.360]  Nowhere.
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:43.961]  It doesn't say that.
[02:50:43.961 --> 02:50:48.665]  And I said, well, why is it that Judaism and Christianity teaches it?
[02:50:48.665 --> 02:50:50.866]  Because they don't read the book correctly.
[02:50:50.866 --> 02:50:51.527]  They don't read it.
[02:50:52.116 --> 02:50:54.678]  Go back and look, it doesn't say God made man.
[02:50:54.678 --> 02:50:57.721]  Made woman!
[02:50:57.721 --> 02:51:00.524]  It says that God... Stay there, stay there, stay there!
[02:51:00.524 --> 02:51:01.865]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[02:51:01.865 --> 02:51:05.548]  Why do police go undercover and why do countries send out spies?
[02:51:05.548 --> 02:51:06.089]  Simple.
[02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:11.033]  If you can guess from intelligence what the other guy is doing, you have the battle won before it starts.
[02:51:11.033 --> 02:51:13.756]  Let's see what intelligence we have about your food situation.
[02:51:13.956 --> 02:51:15.858]  We're having the worst disasters ever.
[02:51:15.858 --> 02:51:18.500]  Storms, earthquakes, floods, and terrible drought.
[02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:22.743]  Half our population needs food stamps and other subsidies to afford their food now.
[02:51:22.743 --> 02:51:26.407]  Prices have just hit their all-time high, with more terrible costs coming.
[02:51:26.407 --> 02:51:30.390]  Your food, and now your water, are being sold to other starving countries.
[02:51:30.390 --> 02:51:35.114]  Still, one-third of our corn goes to expensive gas instead of feeding livestock and people.
[02:51:35.114 --> 02:51:38.417]  What few dollars you have, China expects to devalue to uselessness.
[02:51:38.937 --> 02:51:47.179]  If it's possible to get the most of the best food and freeze the availability and cost before it disappears and is unavailable, you don't dare miss the opportunity.

[02:54:05.891 --> 02:54:08.012]  Well, good news for all of our listeners out there.
[02:54:08.012 --> 02:54:10.854]  Jordan has agreed to stay 20-30 minutes into the next hour.
[02:54:10.854 --> 02:54:16.138]  Some stations don't carry overdrive when we do it, but InfoWars.com has the free audio feeds.
[02:54:16.138 --> 02:54:21.941]  InfoWars.com forward slash show has the audio and video feeds, free podcast links.
[02:54:21.941 --> 02:54:23.222]  Spread the word, folks.
[02:54:23.222 --> 02:54:26.404]  They don't want you thinking outside the box.
[02:54:26.404 --> 02:54:31.808]  And I guess the King James Version says, I'm going from memory, let us make man in our image.
[02:54:32.848 --> 02:54:36.451]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is what the Bible says.
[02:54:36.451 --> 02:54:38.432]  It doesn't overthrow the Bible.
[02:54:38.432 --> 02:54:40.013]  It confirms it.
[02:54:40.013 --> 02:54:41.814]  And this is what the elites believe.
[02:54:41.814 --> 02:54:43.215]  It's open for any interpretation.
[02:54:43.215 --> 02:54:57.865]  We're just discussing this here on air because the elites, skull and bones, the Bushes, get in coffins and do things I can't say on air, on record, believing they're channeling an off-world female entity known as Eulogia.
[02:54:57.865 --> 02:54:58.126]  Okay?
[02:54:59.139 --> 02:55:12.490]  So, most of the people you see on TV, Francois Mitterrand, Tony Blair, hits the ground every morning, according to mainstream news, and is possessed by the spirit of light.
[02:55:12.490 --> 02:55:14.211]  His wife's a witch.
[02:55:14.211 --> 02:55:18.574]  The point is, this is what they're into, they believe all this, they're running things.
[02:55:18.574 --> 02:55:22.878]  So we should know the knowledge they know, so we at least understand them.
[02:55:22.878 --> 02:55:24.980]  They're laughing at us, and Obama is saying,
[02:55:26.124 --> 02:55:29.267]  That the Ukrainian government is elected when it's not elected.
[02:55:29.267 --> 02:55:31.088]  Or that 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:55:31.088 --> 02:55:34.591]  And Jordan, I'm now seeing a war against reality now, like I've never seen.
[02:55:34.591 --> 02:55:39.335]  Where instead of trying to spin stuff, they just outright lie now.
[02:55:39.335 --> 02:55:41.637]  And just, I guess, trying to acclimate us?
[02:55:41.637 --> 02:55:43.418]  What's happening, Jordan Maxwell?
[02:55:43.418 --> 02:55:47.702]  JordanMaxwellShow.com is his only official website, folks.
[02:55:48.562 --> 02:55:50.382]  And you can go there and support him and donate.
[02:55:50.382 --> 02:55:52.903]  He's had all his books, everything taken away from him.
[02:55:52.903 --> 02:55:59.224]  And he's old and, you know, worked a little hard and it's hard for anybody to try to get their stuff back, but support him there.
[02:55:59.224 --> 02:56:02.805]  Jordan, what is your take on what's happening currently in the state of the world?
[02:56:02.805 --> 02:56:06.326]  And we'll get more into ancient history and things in the next hour.
[02:56:06.326 --> 02:56:15.208]  Well, I'm thinking in relation to what I just said before the break about the rabbi said to me, God never created man.
[02:56:15.208 --> 02:56:16.708]  It doesn't say that because
[02:56:17.956 --> 02:56:23.944]  In Hebrew, man is ish, I-S-H, ish, or ishi.
[02:56:23.944 --> 02:56:28.150]  But it doesn't say, come let us make ishi in our image and after likeness.
[02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:29.913]  No, the word is A-D-L.
[02:56:30.885 --> 02:56:31.845]  Adam.
[02:56:31.845 --> 02:56:32.926]  Not Adam.
[02:56:32.926 --> 02:56:33.906]  A-D-A-M.
[02:56:33.906 --> 02:56:34.326]  No.
[02:56:34.326 --> 02:56:37.747]  It's A-D-M in Hebrew, which means something.
[02:56:37.747 --> 02:56:38.987]  A-D-M.
[02:56:38.987 --> 02:56:44.709]  And so, what the Rabbi said is, read it correctly.
[02:56:44.709 --> 02:56:48.230]  It says, God said, come let us.
[02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:49.030]  Who is us?
[02:56:49.890 --> 02:56:55.134]  Come let us make man in our image after our likeness.
[02:56:55.134 --> 02:57:03.179]  It's not saying God made man, but come let us make man in our image after our likeness.
[02:57:03.179 --> 02:57:04.280]  So it's implying
[02:57:04.827 --> 02:57:06.509]  Excuse me.
[02:57:06.509 --> 02:57:11.175]  It's implying that man was already here.
[02:57:11.175 --> 02:57:21.006]  Someone came and said, come let us make this creature that the world calls man into an image like us, to look like us.
[02:57:21.587 --> 02:57:38.907]  Well, if you remember in Genesis 18, when Abraham, that's just one of many examples, but in Genesis 18, the whole chapter is dealing with Abraham and Sarum, when three men, M-E-N, three men come walking up into the camp,
[02:57:40.068 --> 02:57:45.871]  Abraham ran out and bowed down and said, what is my Lord saying to his servant?
[02:57:45.871 --> 02:57:49.633]  And they said that they were on their way to business.
[02:57:49.633 --> 02:57:56.175]  And so the Bible says Abraham insisted that the three men sit and have something to eat first.
[02:57:56.175 --> 02:57:59.077]  And so Sarah, his wife, fixed dinner for them.
[02:57:59.077 --> 02:58:02.218]  They sat under the trees and had dinner.
[02:58:02.218 --> 02:58:03.639]  Then two of them got up
[02:58:04.159 --> 02:58:12.781]  And left on the way, but one of them stayed, and the scripture said that that one who stayed with Abraham was the Almighty God, the Creator.
[02:58:12.781 --> 02:58:14.862]  Melchizedek!
[02:58:14.862 --> 02:58:16.282]  That was one of the names for it.
[02:58:16.282 --> 02:58:25.724]  And then, well, you go back to, as the Rabbi said, go back to Genesis when it said that God walked and talked with Adam in the cool of the evening.
[02:58:25.724 --> 02:58:29.285]  The very word walked and talked with, the Hebrew term,
[02:58:30.709 --> 02:58:36.356]  Is translated meaning someone, you can hear someone walking on leaves and branches.
[02:58:36.356 --> 02:58:38.519]  Stay there, we'll be back in one minute overdrive.
[02:58:38.519 --> 02:58:41.002]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:41.002 --> 02:58:43.685]  Nightly news tonight at 7.

[02:59:52.698 --> 02:59:54.760]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.760 --> 02:59:57.983]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.031 --> 03:00:09.877]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:09.877 --> 03:00:11.458]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.458 --> 03:00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:17.205]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.205 --> 03:00:21.270]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.884 --> 03:00:35.248]  Alright, we got Jordan Maxwell with us, and again, I apologize to the callers that were holding earlier.
[03:00:35.248 --> 03:00:36.829]  We were on other topics.
[03:00:36.829 --> 03:00:43.794]  We're gonna ask Jordan if he wants to take a few phone calls coming up in the next segment before he leaves us.
[03:00:43.794 --> 03:00:48.276]  If he doesn't, I totally understand, and I don't mean to put him on the spot, I forgot to ask during the break.
[03:00:48.276 --> 03:00:52.379]  Jordan, do you want to take a few calls, a few wildcard questions, or do you want to just talk another 20 minutes?
[03:00:53.052 --> 03:00:56.914]  Well, I mean, there's so much we could talk about, but we can always do it later with other things.
[03:00:56.914 --> 03:01:03.396]  A couple of comments I wanted to make about the subject we were talking about before we go to the calls.
[03:01:03.396 --> 03:01:11.740]  Because in Genesis 18, it says three men come walking up into the camp, and Abraham recognized that it was Almighty God.
[03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:15.201]  And in the scriptures, it's in capital letters, it was Almighty God.
[03:01:15.781 --> 03:01:21.126]  And as I said, the word for God walked and talked with Adam in the cool of the evening.
[03:01:21.126 --> 03:01:27.753]  Walked and talked was a word in Hebrew which means to be able to hear someone walking on leaves and branches.
[03:01:27.753 --> 03:01:33.078]  So it was as if somebody actually was walking and talking with this creature we call Adam.
[03:01:33.678 --> 03:01:46.944]  Now if you remember that the Apostle Paul said in Christian Scripture that some have been, he said, always be hospitable to all men for some have entertained angels unaware.
[03:01:46.944 --> 03:01:54.167]  So the implication both in Judaism and Christianity is that the God, God the Creator, looks like us.
[03:01:54.167 --> 03:01:59.130]  He said, come let us make man in our image, after our likeness.
[03:01:59.790 --> 03:02:07.755]  Therefore, it's very possible that what we are seeing as world leaders are, in point of fact, not human.
[03:02:07.755 --> 03:02:08.916]  They look like us.
[03:02:08.916 --> 03:02:17.501]  And, of course, in Hollywood, we've got all these movies for years with all these alien demons and off-world entities, but they look human.
[03:02:17.501 --> 03:02:18.842]  They look like us.
[03:02:18.842 --> 03:02:23.165]  And the Apostle Paul did say that some have entertained angels unaware.
[03:02:23.165 --> 03:02:24.806]  So, what is the implication of this?
[03:02:24.806 --> 03:02:25.467]  Very simple.
[03:02:26.227 --> 03:02:39.055]  We may be, right now, the human race may be in the clutches of entities who look like human, but this would explain why there is no compassion whatsoever for humans.
[03:02:39.055 --> 03:02:48.721]  They don't care about killing people, babies, children, burning and destroying, because in point of fact, in my opinion, they're not fully human.
[03:02:49.301 --> 03:03:02.308]  It's an incredible story, but it's right there in the Bible, and in the Hindu, all of the different religions of the world talk about the aliens who came here who looked like humans and made us.
[03:03:02.308 --> 03:03:03.988]  It's an extraordinary story.
[03:03:03.988 --> 03:03:06.690]  You better go back and start doing your homework on what the Bible says.
[03:03:06.690 --> 03:03:08.010]  Well, this is what the elite believe.
[03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:10.732]  I mean, why do you think John Carpenter made a movie about it?
[03:03:11.872 --> 03:03:15.434]  Or all these ancient cultures, the body snatchers, all of it.
[03:03:15.434 --> 03:03:20.456]  Regardless, this is what the elite believe, so that's why it's important for us to look at it.
[03:03:20.456 --> 03:03:21.577]  That's exactly right.
[03:03:21.577 --> 03:03:22.237]  No doubt about it.
[03:03:23.296 --> 03:03:24.897]  We can take some calls.
[03:03:24.897 --> 03:03:28.758]  It doesn't necessarily mean I'll have any answers, but we can talk to calls.
[03:03:28.758 --> 03:03:29.858]  I would be happy to.
[03:03:29.858 --> 03:03:34.420]  Well, you know, that's why they promote racism, all this division.
[03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:39.321]  They've got to get us fighting with each other while they're literally creating a breakaway civilization.
[03:03:39.321 --> 03:03:42.862]  And Ray Kurzweil and all of them say they're going to become God and live forever.
[03:03:42.862 --> 03:03:49.544]  So regardless, they're trying to become gods, building a technological tower of Babel.
[03:03:49.544 --> 03:03:51.785]  The toll-free number to talk to Jordan Maxwell is 800.
[03:03:52.705 --> 03:03:53.385]  We're good to go.
[03:04:08.231 --> 03:04:09.852]  Jordan Maxwell Show.com.
[03:04:09.852 --> 03:04:11.233]  Glad you're doing a podcast.
[03:04:11.233 --> 03:04:12.454]  People should go there and check it out.
[03:04:12.454 --> 03:04:15.796]  It's very thought-provoking, even if you disagree with some of it, folks.
[03:04:15.796 --> 03:04:17.958]  We're just simply trying to explore and think here.
[03:04:17.958 --> 03:04:23.001]  But I want you to think about the point of, can it be defeated?
[03:04:23.001 --> 03:04:24.522]  Can it be stopped?
[03:04:24.522 --> 03:04:27.004]  And are they trying to become omnipresent?
[03:04:27.004 --> 03:04:29.365]  Or why are they trying to become omnipresent?
[03:04:29.365 --> 03:04:31.166]  Jordan Maxwell on the other side.
[03:04:31.166 --> 03:04:33.788]  So cogitate on that, Jordan.
[03:04:33.788 --> 03:04:34.969]  And again, I'm really proud of it.
[03:04:34.969 --> 03:04:36.170]  It's the new trailer.
[03:04:36.170 --> 03:04:36.990]  They Live Trailer 2014.
[03:04:38.691 --> 03:04:44.254]  For a hypothetical film, I guess we could get old John Carpenter and Roddy Piper and make a new one.
[03:04:44.254 --> 03:04:45.994]  But it ties it into the real world.
[03:04:45.994 --> 03:04:48.155]  Very powerful.
[03:04:48.155 --> 03:04:50.556]  I can read the comments on YouTube and on the site.
[03:04:50.556 --> 03:04:51.877]  Listeners are flipping out over it.
[03:04:51.877 --> 03:04:53.138]  It's pretty powerful.
[03:04:53.138 --> 03:04:56.979]  And it's been sent out on my tweet at Real Alex Jones as well.
[03:04:56.979 --> 03:04:57.740]  Stay with us.
[03:04:57.740 --> 03:04:58.320]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.164 --> 03:05:07.286]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forward situation?
[03:05:07.286 --> 03:05:10.687]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[03:05:10.687 --> 03:05:12.287]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[03:05:12.287 --> 03:05:18.489]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:05:18.669 --> 03:05:24.715]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[03:05:24.715 --> 03:05:28.659]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[03:05:28.659 --> 03:05:31.622]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[03:05:31.622 --> 03:05:39.970]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[03:05:39.970 --> 03:05:42.092]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[03:05:42.092 --> 03:05:43.133]  It's a war against the truth.
[03:05:43.473 --> 03:05:52.381]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[03:06:58.949 --> 03:06:59.693]  Effective.
[03:07:00.285 --> 03:07:05.606]  This is a special news alert to consumers who owe back taxes to the IRS.
[03:07:05.606 --> 03:07:09.287]  Due to the financial hardship consumers are facing during the decline in the U.S.
[03:07:09.287 --> 03:07:17.689]  economy, the Internal Revenue Service is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers on back taxes, resulting in back taxes reduced by thousands of dollars.
[03:07:17.689 --> 03:07:26.751]  An open phone line has been established by Federal Tax Relief for consumers to call and see if you qualify for this reduction to ensure your financial stability during this decline in the economy.
[03:07:26.971 --> 03:07:27.231]  I think so.
[03:07:48.697 --> 03:07:50.478]  Call the Federal Tax Relief Hotline.
[03:07:50.478 --> 03:07:50.659]  1-800-210-1349.
[03:07:50.659 --> 03:07:50.779]  1-800-210-1349.
[03:07:50.779 --> 03:07:51.059]  That's 1-800-210-1349.
[03:07:51.059 --> 03:07:53.100]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:53.100 --> 03:07:54.482]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.452 --> 03:08:15.176]  We've only got time for one more final segment with Jordan Maxwell.
[03:08:15.176 --> 03:08:16.477]  And I really appreciate him coming on.
[03:08:16.477 --> 03:08:20.561]  I look forward to having him back on to cover world events and get into symbolism more.
[03:08:20.561 --> 03:08:27.126]  I want to take a few phone calls for him here in just a moment from Frank, Steve, Dustin, and others.
[03:08:27.126 --> 03:08:34.273]  But Jordan, take a few minutes to talk about any other subject that you think is important or tidbits you'd like to break down here on air today.
[03:08:34.878 --> 03:08:45.043]  Well, I would love to talk about, and we need to do a show on this, Alex, maybe a two-hour show, because this is very important stuff, is how money is created.
[03:08:45.043 --> 03:08:49.625]  And all money is based on water.
[03:08:49.625 --> 03:08:53.567]  And I want you to understand that there are two kinds of law on the earth.
[03:08:53.567 --> 03:08:57.229]  We call it the law of the land and the law of the sea.
[03:08:57.881 --> 03:09:00.441]  So, we've all heard the term, the law of the land.
[03:09:00.441 --> 03:09:02.522]  But why do you have a law of the land?
[03:09:02.522 --> 03:09:05.902]  Because on the opposing side, there's a law of the sea.
[03:09:05.902 --> 03:09:07.563]  The law of water.
[03:09:07.563 --> 03:09:10.123]  So we say that a law of water is money.
[03:09:10.123 --> 03:09:11.003]  It's banking.
[03:09:11.003 --> 03:09:12.504]  The law of water.
[03:09:12.504 --> 03:09:14.784]  This is why, where do you have a bank?
[03:09:14.784 --> 03:09:16.564]  You go into a bank.
[03:09:16.564 --> 03:09:17.925]  Where do you find a bank?
[03:09:17.925 --> 03:09:19.425]  It's on both sides of a river.
[03:09:19.425 --> 03:09:21.285]  It's called a river bank.
[03:09:21.285 --> 03:09:23.006]  What does a river bank do?
[03:09:23.006 --> 03:09:25.166]  It directs the flow of the current sea.
[03:09:25.871 --> 03:09:28.994]  Because your money is called currency.
[03:09:28.994 --> 03:09:30.175]  It's a current.
[03:09:30.175 --> 03:09:32.798]  Ebb and flow, back and forth, comes and goes.
[03:09:33.482 --> 03:09:38.224]  And so it's a current, and it's called currency, and it's also water.
[03:09:38.224 --> 03:09:40.686]  So we say money goes through your hands like water.
[03:09:40.686 --> 03:09:41.466]  Of course it's water.
[03:09:41.466 --> 03:09:55.933]  And by the way, in the Academy Award winning film Network, when he talks to the top globalist, he tells Howard Beale, you have meddled with the tidal forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and you will atone, and I will not have it.
[03:09:55.933 --> 03:09:57.134]  And he describes it as water.
[03:09:57.782 --> 03:09:59.062]  That's exactly right.
[03:09:59.062 --> 03:09:59.983]  It is water.
[03:09:59.983 --> 03:10:02.563]  And so, it's called Maritime Admiralty.
[03:10:02.563 --> 03:10:07.404]  Now, it really gets into some deep and fascinating stuff.
[03:10:07.404 --> 03:10:11.845]  Because the Earth is considered a vessel in space.
[03:10:11.845 --> 03:10:13.326]  It's a spaceship.
[03:10:13.326 --> 03:10:18.007]  And since it's a vessel in space, it's carrying the blood of the human race.
[03:10:18.007 --> 03:10:20.647]  So, this is why we have a blood vessel.
[03:10:20.647 --> 03:10:26.049]  Because you are part of a living entity floating through space.
[03:10:26.049 --> 03:10:26.449]  And so,
[03:10:28.363 --> 03:10:46.271]  It all has to do with water, shipping, when your mother, you know, your father manufactured while your mother was in labor building you in the delivery room, just like you have your refrigerator delivered to you.
[03:10:46.271 --> 03:10:48.893]  And we're human resources.
[03:10:48.893 --> 03:10:49.633]  Exactly.
[03:10:49.633 --> 03:10:50.754]  Resource.
[03:10:50.754 --> 03:10:57.317]  Then when you find out that, in order to understand banking and water, the sea,
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:05.646]  All the terms which are used, and I will get into this later on another program, but so it's on board a ship.
[03:11:05.646 --> 03:11:11.350]  So when a ship pulls into a harbor, where the ship parked is called its birth.
[03:11:11.350 --> 03:11:13.071]  B-E-R-T-H.
[03:11:13.071 --> 03:11:15.233]  A ship is parked in its birth.
[03:11:15.233 --> 03:11:18.875]  And every item on that ship coming off represents money.
[03:11:18.875 --> 03:11:22.918]  So every item has to have a certificate of manifest.
[03:11:22.918 --> 03:11:25.040]  It's called a birth certificate.
[03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:26.041]  But when you are born,
[03:11:26.621 --> 03:11:28.862]  You came out of your mother's water.
[03:11:28.862 --> 03:11:29.703]  Her water broke.
[03:11:29.703 --> 03:11:38.487]  And now they're phasing out the land law and they're going purely to the Admiralty that's always been known as more authoritarian and oppressive.
[03:11:38.487 --> 03:11:39.187]  Absolutely.
[03:11:39.187 --> 03:11:41.589]  And it has to do with the shipping.
[03:11:41.589 --> 03:11:43.590]  And this is why you have a citizenship.
[03:11:44.310 --> 03:11:51.558]  A companionship, dealership, scholarship, courtship, friendship, it all has to do with shipping.
[03:11:51.558 --> 03:11:56.183]  It has to do with monetary money on the high seas.
[03:11:56.183 --> 03:11:58.645]  Pirates of the Caribbean, get it?
[03:11:58.645 --> 03:12:03.611]  As though there's a world of occult knowledge dealing with banking, with money.
[03:12:04.031 --> 03:12:15.622]  How it works and this stuff is hundreds if not thousands of years old that could be traced all the way back to the Phoenicians, Canaanites, Sumerians and actually back to Babylonia itself.
[03:12:15.622 --> 03:12:19.326]  You need to understand how the world really works.
[03:12:19.326 --> 03:12:20.988]  Let's set this up now and take a few calls.
[03:12:20.988 --> 03:12:23.550]  How about two hours some day next week?
[03:12:23.550 --> 03:12:24.351]  You tell me what day.
[03:12:24.351 --> 03:12:25.211]  Your Skype's great.
[03:12:25.211 --> 03:12:26.773]  Looks like you're here in studio with us.
[03:12:26.773 --> 03:12:34.000]  We'll do two hours because I know you're dead on about the money, the admiralty, the Venetian slash Roman admiralty law.
[03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:47.565]  Which was the first banking bills of Leighton manifest and how that became the British Empire when they got run out of Italy and out of France and it's just all mainline history and people don't even know mainline history.
[03:12:47.565 --> 03:12:56.348]  They have to understand that now they're coming into a new system where they plan to turn off the resources and cull most of the population.
[03:12:56.348 --> 03:12:58.568]  So I want to talk about the endgame with you.
[03:12:58.568 --> 03:13:02.830]  So pick a day before you leave us when we go to break here and the show's over in a few minutes.
[03:13:03.757 --> 03:13:06.541]  Jordan Maxwell of JordanMaxwellShow.com.
[03:13:06.541 --> 03:13:16.154]  People should go check things out there and also donate to get your operation back up and running after some health issues and sabotage so people can certainly hear from him.
[03:13:16.154 --> 03:13:17.396]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:13:17.396 --> 03:13:20.139]  Jordan Maxwell really gets people thinking.
[03:13:20.740 --> 03:13:39.086]  And that's what matters, is getting people outside the box, or to see the pipes, not to be in the pipes, but outside the pipes, out of the matrix, out of the little tub, little barrel they want to keep us in, and to break the subliminal programming.
[03:13:39.086 --> 03:13:40.787]  And it's very close to happening.
[03:13:40.787 --> 03:13:44.268]  So we'll talk to him next week, but let's go to five calls right now.
[03:13:44.268 --> 03:13:46.149]  Quick questions for Jordan Maxwell.
[03:13:46.149 --> 03:13:48.730]  Dustin in Nebraska, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:13:51.341 --> 03:13:53.564]  Yes, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:13:53.564 --> 03:14:01.253]  I was just wanting to ask, my brother is two years done from completing his Jesuit vocation.
[03:14:01.253 --> 03:14:05.858]  Do they brainwash priests that are studying to become priests?
[03:14:05.858 --> 03:14:10.964]  And then, should I warn my brother that we are truth behind Jesuits?
[03:14:12.848 --> 03:14:15.309]  I'm not really understanding the question.
[03:14:15.309 --> 03:14:18.651]  He's asking about the Jesuits and his brother's been brainwashed.
[03:14:18.651 --> 03:14:22.653]  Thank you for the call.
[03:14:22.653 --> 03:14:28.136]  Just go and do some research on Jesuits and on the Vatican and where it came from.
[03:14:28.676 --> 03:14:30.417]  When it was founded, by who?
[03:14:30.417 --> 03:14:32.217]  Who founded the Vatican?
[03:14:32.217 --> 03:14:37.699]  And then look into the whole concept of something called Corporation Soles.
[03:14:37.699 --> 03:14:38.659]  S-O-L-E.
[03:14:38.659 --> 03:14:40.539]  Corporation Soles.
[03:14:40.539 --> 03:14:47.601]  That's a political standing or political office developed by the Vatican, for the Vatican.
[03:14:47.601 --> 03:14:50.322]  It has to do with royalty in Europe.
[03:14:50.322 --> 03:14:54.183]  Just remember, this is a very basic concept.
[03:14:54.183 --> 03:14:57.504]  For at least two thousand... The Vatican gave franchises to royal families.
[03:14:58.024 --> 03:14:58.904]  Exactly.
[03:14:58.904 --> 03:14:59.544]  Precisely.
[03:14:59.544 --> 03:15:05.146]  That's why the royal families of Europe say that they are appointed by God.
[03:15:05.146 --> 03:15:07.586]  They have a divine ordination.
[03:15:07.586 --> 03:15:10.307]  Well, when you talk about divine, what God?
[03:15:10.307 --> 03:15:11.387]  Well, the Vatican!
[03:15:11.387 --> 03:15:13.988]  Yeah, I wouldn't say the Jesuits are brainwashed.
[03:15:13.988 --> 03:15:22.510]  They are given Jewitical thinking, which means triple-sided or more, to see things from all different angles.
[03:15:23.123 --> 03:15:29.408]  Yes, I'm going to add something that I can't explain it fully now, but we will talk about later.
[03:15:29.408 --> 03:15:48.363]  This whole idea of the Jesuit influence on world government and world politics is extremely interesting when you get into the religious aspect of Jesus on the earth and the church and Christianity.
[03:15:48.363 --> 03:15:50.365]  It's very, very devious.
[03:15:50.365 --> 03:15:51.566]  It's very, very big.
[03:15:52.486 --> 03:15:53.086]  Very interesting.
[03:15:53.086 --> 03:15:55.407]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Maine.
[03:15:55.407 --> 03:15:56.267]  You're on the air.
[03:15:56.267 --> 03:15:58.527]  Go ahead, your question.
[03:15:58.527 --> 03:15:59.848]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:15:59.848 --> 03:16:01.448]  Good, good, go ahead.
[03:16:01.448 --> 03:16:03.068]  Question for Jordan.
[03:16:03.068 --> 03:16:06.469]  Deergo Children.
[03:16:06.469 --> 03:16:08.749]  Again, again, I'm not hearing it well.
[03:16:08.749 --> 03:16:10.330]  He's saying Deergo Children.
[03:16:10.330 --> 03:16:12.050]  Usually people can't hear good on Skype.
[03:16:12.050 --> 03:16:13.010]  I don't know why.
[03:16:13.010 --> 03:16:14.190]  It's Deergo Children.
[03:16:14.190 --> 03:16:16.311]  He wants to know if you know about that.
[03:16:16.311 --> 03:16:17.411]  No, I'm not.
[03:16:18.382 --> 03:16:20.163]  I'm not familiar, I guess, with that term.
[03:16:20.163 --> 03:16:22.064]  What was the first word again?
[03:16:22.064 --> 03:16:25.125]  D-I-R-G-I-O, child.
[03:16:25.125 --> 03:16:27.006]  Oh, yeah, no, no.
[03:16:27.006 --> 03:16:31.689]  Caller, do you got something that we can talk about?
[03:16:31.689 --> 03:16:34.130]  A lot of people with these are like people with dyslexia.
[03:16:36.631 --> 03:16:44.934]  Sure, they're saying that there's a transformation in children and that the human species is rapidly changing and these are actually gifted children.
[03:16:44.934 --> 03:16:46.494]  I'm familiar somewhat with it.
[03:16:46.494 --> 03:16:47.214]  Go ahead.
[03:16:47.214 --> 03:16:49.775]  Well, I am too with that, with the indigo children.
[03:16:49.775 --> 03:16:53.677]  Yeah, I think you mean indigo children, not deer-go.
[03:16:53.677 --> 03:16:54.157]  Go ahead.
[03:16:56.209 --> 03:16:59.472]  Tell us about Indigo Children, Maxwell.
[03:16:59.472 --> 03:17:17.445]  Indigo Children, the implication is that it's a whole new kind of human that's being born into the world, and it very well might have something to do with God doing it instead of us, because these children that are being born today seem to be far more sensitive
[03:17:17.965 --> 03:17:18.846]  It's unbelievable.
[03:17:38.885 --> 03:17:39.385]  Right.
[03:17:39.385 --> 03:17:41.567]  Well, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[03:17:41.567 --> 03:17:50.473]  Most of the children look totally brain-damaged and half-dead, but then you're going to see a manifestation, archetypal, epigenetics, you name it, resisting it.
[03:17:50.473 --> 03:17:54.195]  You're going to see all sorts... This is the incredible time to be alive.
[03:17:54.195 --> 03:17:55.336]  You got that right.
[03:17:55.336 --> 03:17:57.757]  It's the great age of exploration here.
[03:17:57.757 --> 03:17:59.298]  Let's talk to Frank in West Virginia.
[03:17:59.298 --> 03:18:00.479]  Sorry we've got to go fast.
[03:18:00.479 --> 03:18:02.721]  Go ahead, Frank.
[03:18:02.721 --> 03:18:05.582]  Yes, just to ask you about this.
[03:18:05.582 --> 03:18:07.804]  One talk you brought up that quite some length
[03:18:08.679 --> 03:18:14.044]  Genesis 1.7, so God created man in his own image.
[03:18:14.044 --> 03:18:18.048]  Now, Mr. Maxwell, you quoted another passage which was correct.
[03:18:18.658 --> 03:18:22.139]  However, your understanding that God did not create man is not true.
[03:18:22.139 --> 03:18:25.380]  It is clear God created man in his own image.
[03:18:25.380 --> 03:18:26.740]  Oh, I do believe God made man.
[03:18:26.740 --> 03:18:31.161]  I mean, he was getting into the other quote, though, about what that definition means.
[03:18:31.161 --> 03:18:32.621]  Oh, about replenish?
[03:18:32.621 --> 03:18:39.163]  Yeah, and there's also replenish, which, if you check the root word, this is a primary Hebrew word, the root word, which is malah.
[03:18:40.265 --> 03:18:44.848]  It means to fill, not to refill or to fill over again, but just simply to fill.
[03:18:44.848 --> 03:18:49.691]  Well, listen, it's open for debate and we will take more calls when he's on for two hours next week getting into money.
[03:18:49.691 --> 03:18:51.632]  But we'll spend at least 30 minutes on calls.
[03:18:51.632 --> 03:18:53.133]  I'm sorry to Shelly and Jim.
[03:18:53.133 --> 03:18:53.914]  We're out of time.
[03:18:53.914 --> 03:18:55.495]  Closing comments.
[03:18:55.495 --> 03:18:57.476]  I appreciate this interesting interview.
[03:18:57.476 --> 03:18:59.237]  Jordan Maxwell.
[03:18:59.237 --> 03:18:59.697]  Thank you.
[03:18:59.697 --> 03:19:01.759]  Thank you very much, Alex, for having me on.
[03:19:01.759 --> 03:19:07.082]  And as you said, yes, I've been under attack for a long time and I'm finally, finally getting
[03:19:07.452 --> 03:19:07.692]  I don't know.
[03:19:16.145 --> 03:19:23.266]  At 74 years old, I'm struggling to fight to get all that belongs to me that I've worked for all my life to get it back.
[03:19:23.266 --> 03:19:26.107]  But I have to do it in court, and that costs money.
[03:19:26.107 --> 03:19:37.529]  And the people who took my website and my products and took the money they took, they have also, you need to know, my email has been redirected to the people who own my website.
[03:19:37.529 --> 03:19:40.369]  Okay, so the only place to go is jordanmaxwellshow.com.
[03:19:40.369 --> 03:19:42.130]  We'll talk to you again next week.
[03:19:42.130 --> 03:19:43.070]  You can do next week, right?
[03:19:43.630 --> 03:19:45.232]  Yes, and I will be happy to.
