[03:19.720 --> 03:23.200]  playing the race card calling on churches to support the campaign a new
[03:23.200 --> 03:27.360]  Harvard study says that pasteurized milk from industrial dairies is definitely
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.200]  linked to cancer you know how they're always attacking raw milk and saying it's
[03:31.200 --> 03:34.920]  so dangerous for you oh my god don't drink anything that's alive well they
[03:34.920 --> 03:39.880]  don't tell you the truth that pasteurized milk is so filthy that if they
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.480]  didn't pasteurize it and kill everything in it that milk would probably kill you
[03:43.480 --> 03:48.120]  overnight it's very dirty and it has again been linked to cancer we'll get
[03:48.120 --> 03:52.880]  into more of that we've got the emails from WikiLeaks already mentioned that
[03:52.880 --> 03:58.560]  and then the actual glossary of terms from strat4 where they get into
[03:58.560 --> 04:04.000]  describing the ATF and the FBI and Israeli intelligence and some of the
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.780]  other interesting organizations around the world all that coming up and much
[04:08.780 --> 04:14.400]  more plus a mystery virus kills thousands of lambs in the UK this is
[04:14.400 --> 04:18.400]  being published by the Telegraph the National Farmers Union has called it a
[04:18.400 --> 04:23.840]  catastrophe and a ticking time bomb we've got the TSA Airport checkpoint left
[04:23.840 --> 04:28.320]  unattended in Sacramento yeah they just walked off the job there but gee I mean
[04:28.320 --> 04:32.800]  who wouldn't if you work for the TSA why would you want to stay right and then

[04:39.080 --> 04:45.200]  be open to more drones in the next 90 days we'll have that timeline for you and
[04:45.200 --> 04:50.000]  much more when we return here on the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams the
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.800]  health ranger filling in for Alex today stay with us we'll be right back with all
[04:53.800 --> 05:02.920]  that news and much more straight ahead a little over a year ago I began to do a
[05:02.920 --> 05:07.120]  lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.640]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[05:11.640 --> 05:14.520]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.840]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.960]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[05:23.960 --> 05:28.880]  off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral
[05:28.880 --> 05:33.240]  company out there and discovered young Jevity the young Jevity products are
[05:33.240 --> 05:37.440]  designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that you
[05:37.440 --> 05:43.080]  don't have to eat as much to be satisfied I've lost 37 pounds in two months
[05:43.080 --> 05:47.360]  simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need check it out for yourself
[05:47.360 --> 05:52.240]  it's incredible go to info wars team comm today and order your first canister
[05:52.240 --> 05:57.000]  of beyond tangy tangerine complete multivitamin mineral complex dietary
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.400]  supplement that's info wars team comm hi this is Alex Jones did you know that
[06:02.400 --> 06:05.800]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.680]  vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[06:09.680 --> 06:13.280]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about
[06:13.280 --> 06:16.680]  performing gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[06:16.680 --> 06:20.480]  even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together
[06:20.480 --> 06:25.920]  the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can
[06:25.920 --> 06:30.320]  produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and
[06:30.320 --> 06:34.040]  here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[06:34.040 --> 06:38.600]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit
[06:38.600 --> 06:43.760]  them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give
[06:43.760 --> 06:48.440]  them a call at eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five that's eight
[06:48.440 --> 06:54.760]  seven seven three two seven zero three six five remember in a real crisis non
[06:54.760 --> 06:58.920]  hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed
[06:58.920 --> 07:04.360]  bank dot com you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses
[07:04.360 --> 07:08.440]  the respiratory system with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[07:08.440 --> 07:11.840]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[07:11.840 --> 07:16.680]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[07:16.680 --> 07:20.360]  name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[07:20.360 --> 07:24.520]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[07:24.520 --> 07:28.940]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices
[07:28.940 --> 07:34.160]  needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this
[07:34.160 --> 07:40.440]  includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[07:40.440 --> 07:44.600]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver
[07:44.600 --> 07:50.880]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung
[07:50.880 --> 07:55.560]  system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[07:55.560 --> 08:11.120]  that's www.silverlungs.com he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:11.120 --> 08:17.960]  welcome back it's Monday February 27th 2012 this is the Alex Jones show my name
[08:17.960 --> 08:21.960]  is Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex today who's on the road he's
[08:21.960 --> 08:26.360]  in Orlando Florida just finishing up a very successful live presentation
[08:26.360 --> 08:31.240]  yesterday we've both been on the road a lot lately and I have to apologize I'm
[08:31.240 --> 08:35.600]  a little bit stuffed up today I sort of blew my voice out on Friday doing this
[08:35.600 --> 08:40.520]  this bit you know how I do the these satire bits that are really relevant to
[08:40.520 --> 08:45.600]  current events we did this TSA help wanted satire animation that was really
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.600]  popular that Google censored and I did all the voiceover for that and I was
[08:50.600 --> 08:55.440]  doing this this voiceover bit for Bill Gates you know because Bill Gates is
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.480]  guys depopulation agenda and he's got all this technology that's trying to cause
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.880]  infertility like these ultrasound items that are causing infertility in
[09:03.880 --> 09:07.360]  males and you know the mosquitoes and and the GMOs and everything it's like
[09:07.360 --> 09:11.320]  depopulating the planet and I was doing this bit called Bill Gates the
[09:11.320 --> 09:16.720]  sperminator it was like the Terminator movie and but it was it was all about
[09:16.720 --> 09:20.580]  Bill Gates and I sort of blew my voice out doing that and then I guess I got
[09:20.580 --> 09:23.960]  exposed something so I'm I'm slightly symptomatic fighting it off but feeling
[09:23.960 --> 09:29.540]  feeling great but in fact bring up that bring up that cartoon we did publish the
[09:29.540 --> 09:34.200]  cartoon on Friday of Bill Gates the Sperminator if you would for those of you
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.960]  watching on Prism Planet dot TV that's the cartoon and it's it's a really
[09:38.960 --> 09:42.780]  funny bit I'll just I'll do a little bit for you it goes it goes like
[09:42.780 --> 09:47.820]  Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun using exotic technology from the future
[09:47.820 --> 09:52.820]  One man is trying to destroy humanity.
[09:52.820 --> 09:57.820]  Hasta la vista, babies, nomas hijos.
[09:57.820 --> 10:02.820]  Yes, Bill Gates is the sperminator.
[10:02.820 --> 10:05.820]  Coming soon to a theater near you.
[10:05.820 --> 10:10.820]  Humanity's only chance to fight back against the depopulation agenda
[10:10.820 --> 10:14.820]  is to catch him downloading Microsoft Windows updates and patches.
[10:14.820 --> 10:19.820]  Anyway, it goes on like that. It's just a little bit that hopefully we'll get finished
[10:19.820 --> 10:23.820]  and we'll play for you. Nothing like a little comic relief from time to time.
[10:23.820 --> 10:26.820]  Now, speaking of that, we are going to cover all the hard-hitting news for today.
[10:26.820 --> 10:30.820]  We've got Ian Varela coming up at the bottom of this hour.
[10:30.820 --> 10:32.820]  Jonathan Emore to the top of the next hour.
[10:32.820 --> 10:36.820]  He has a new book called Restore the Republic with a forward by Ron Paul.
[10:36.820 --> 10:40.820]  And we've got Liz Wright-Zig talking about food freedom and the raw milk events
[10:40.820 --> 10:42.820]  coming up later this week.
[10:42.820 --> 10:46.820]  And now let's get right to the news.
[10:46.820 --> 10:49.820]  We've got, well, let's start with this one, the school shooting today.
[10:49.820 --> 10:53.820]  I'm not going to spend much time on this because all the facts haven't come out yet that are relevant.
[10:53.820 --> 10:55.820]  But there has been a school shooting today.
[10:55.820 --> 10:58.820]  Of course, the mainstream media is going to blame guns.
[10:58.820 --> 11:06.820]  Of course, what won't come out is whether or not the student or whoever ended up doing the shooting,
[11:06.820 --> 11:10.820]  we don't know that fact yet, whether or not they were on psychiatric drugs.
[11:10.820 --> 11:14.820]  Because we know that antidepressants and SSRIs and all of these psychiatric drugs
[11:14.820 --> 11:18.820]  caused children to feel isolated from reality.
[11:18.820 --> 11:21.820]  And the school shootings in the past, like Columbine, for example,
[11:21.820 --> 11:24.820]  involved children who thought they were playing a video game
[11:24.820 --> 11:27.820]  because their minds were so disconnected from reality.
[11:27.820 --> 11:34.820]  So they could run around and shoot their fellow classmates and not even feel anything, feel no empathy.
[11:34.820 --> 11:36.820]  They didn't even realize that they were doing that.
[11:36.820 --> 11:41.820]  And time and time again, not in every case, but in many cases, I would say the majority of cases,
[11:41.820 --> 11:44.820]  these school shootings are linked to psychiatric drugs.
[11:44.820 --> 11:48.820]  So it would be very interesting to see if this shooter or shooter,
[11:48.820 --> 11:51.820]  whatever the case may be, has been linked to psychiatric drugs.
[11:51.820 --> 11:54.820]  And if so, whether the mainstream media will even cover it.
[11:54.820 --> 11:56.820]  Why do we call them the mainstream?
[11:56.820 --> 11:57.820]  You know, the hoax media.
[11:57.820 --> 11:59.820]  We still haven't settled on a name for that.
[11:59.820 --> 12:04.820]  But we're not going to get into the details of that shooting until we know more about the shooter.
[12:04.820 --> 12:09.820]  But just giving you a preview of the correct way to interpret that,
[12:09.820 --> 12:14.820]  it's probably drug-related psychiatric drug, FDA-approved prescription drug related.
[12:14.820 --> 12:24.820]  Now, in other news, I've got an urgent red alert call for the development of a peer-to-peer alternative news application.
[12:24.820 --> 12:27.820]  This is a call that I put out last night on naturalnews.com
[12:27.820 --> 12:36.820]  that we need to fight back against censorship on Google, on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook,
[12:36.820 --> 12:37.820]  all across the Internet.
[12:37.820 --> 12:42.820]  And the way to do that is we need a team out there who can develop a peer-to-peer,
[12:42.820 --> 12:47.820]  a bit torrent-like application that allows us to share and carry news,
[12:47.820 --> 12:50.820]  text, audio, and video news that's distributed peer-to-peer.
[12:50.820 --> 12:52.820]  There is no application like that that exists.
[12:52.820 --> 12:58.820]  I have tried to talk to Alex about that, but he's so super busy running Infowars and he's on the road and so on.
[12:58.820 --> 13:01.820]  I just decided to go ahead and take on this project myself.
[13:01.820 --> 13:04.820]  If it's successful, we will, of course, share it with Infowars.
[13:04.820 --> 13:11.820]  The idea being that Infowars and naturalnews would be the first two news organizations to use this peer-to-peer,
[13:11.820 --> 13:13.820]  bit torrent-like news application.
[13:13.820 --> 13:15.820]  It would bypass the search engines.
[13:15.820 --> 13:17.820]  It would bypass all the social networks.
[13:17.820 --> 13:21.820]  It would get information directly into the hands of people all across the country.
[13:21.820 --> 13:26.820]  So if you know somebody who is able to help develop that technology,
[13:26.820 --> 13:31.820]  send an email to p2p at naturalnews.com.
[13:31.820 --> 13:33.820]  Again, that's p2p at naturalnews.com.
[13:33.820 --> 13:37.820]  I will personally spearhead the development, the project management of that campaign,
[13:37.820 --> 13:44.820]  and share that technology with Infowars so that we can get another pathway of getting information out to you
[13:44.820 --> 13:45.820]  that cannot be censored.
[13:45.820 --> 13:48.820]  This is crucial for the future of free information.
[13:48.820 --> 13:50.820]  I believe information should be free.
[13:50.820 --> 13:57.820]  And I'm also against all of the patents on seeds, all the patents on medicines, on foods, on animals,
[13:57.820 --> 13:58.820]  all of those things.
[13:58.820 --> 13:59.820]  I believe information should be free.
[13:59.820 --> 14:03.820]  And that application can help us continue to exercise our free speech rights,
[14:03.820 --> 14:07.820]  especially when times are getting increasingly uncertain.
[14:07.820 --> 14:14.820]  And along that note, Wyoming is now looking at a House Bill 85 where they're saying it would create,
[14:14.820 --> 14:20.820]  this bill of pass would create a state-run government continuity task force which would study
[14:20.820 --> 14:25.820]  and prepare Wyoming for potential catastrophes from disruptions in food supplies
[14:25.820 --> 14:27.820]  to a complete meltdown of the federal government.
[14:27.820 --> 14:31.820]  Isn't that interesting that the state of Wyoming is now looking at doing this?
[14:31.820 --> 14:36.820]  It would even cover Wyoming potentially issuing its own alternative currency.
[14:36.820 --> 14:37.820]  How's that?
[14:37.820 --> 14:39.820]  Yeah, very interesting.
[14:39.820 --> 14:46.820]  In addition, it would also examine the conditions under which Wyoming would need to implement its own military draft.
[14:46.820 --> 14:47.820]  Wow, you don't hear that very often.
[14:47.820 --> 14:53.820]  Raise a standing army and acquire strike aircraft and an aircraft carrier.
[14:53.820 --> 14:58.820]  Now, when I saw that, I thought, don't you need an ocean for an aircraft carrier?
[14:58.820 --> 15:06.820]  Because, I mean, maybe my geography is a little bit behind, but I don't think Wyoming has an ocean.
[15:06.820 --> 15:11.820]  Are you going to float the aircraft carrier out there in one of the lakes in Yellowstone or something?
[15:11.820 --> 15:16.820]  But nonwithstanding that little seeming glitch in their plan, they are talking about raising their own army,
[15:16.820 --> 15:18.820]  having a military draft potentially.
[15:18.820 --> 15:21.820]  Again, they're not saying there's any urgent issue on the horizon.
[15:21.820 --> 15:24.820]  They're just saying, you know, the world is not stable.
[15:24.820 --> 15:27.820]  Let's look at what we should do as a state to protect the rights of our citizens,
[15:27.820 --> 15:29.820]  to protect the safety of our citizens.
[15:29.820 --> 15:32.820]  And I think it's an intelligent thing to do.
[15:32.820 --> 15:36.820]  But if more and more states do that, I wonder what the feds are going to think about that.
[15:36.820 --> 15:38.820]  How dare you states have your own army?
[15:38.820 --> 15:41.820]  How dare you think about your own currency?
[15:41.820 --> 15:42.820]  How dare you?
[15:42.820 --> 15:44.820]  That's what the feds are going to say about that.
[15:44.820 --> 15:48.820]  We've got a mystery virus that is killing thousands of lambs in the UK.
[15:48.820 --> 15:50.820]  Moving on to health news.
[15:50.820 --> 15:52.820]  Thousands of lambs have been killed by a new virus.
[15:52.820 --> 15:57.820]  It's causing serious deformities such as fused limbs and twisted necks,
[15:57.820 --> 16:02.820]  which means the newborn lambs cannot survive.
[16:02.820 --> 16:05.820]  74 farms across southern and eastern England have been hit by this virus.
[16:05.820 --> 16:09.820]  The National Farmers Union in the UK has called it a ticking time bomb.
[16:09.820 --> 16:14.820]  Now, when I read this news, I immediately began to think that this could be related to GMOs.
[16:14.820 --> 16:16.820]  I'm not certain of that.
[16:16.820 --> 16:18.820]  You know, the jury's still out on that.
[16:18.820 --> 16:19.820]  We need more science.
[16:19.820 --> 16:22.820]  But remember last week when Jeffrey Smith was on the Alex Jones show
[16:22.820 --> 16:25.820]  and Jeffrey was talking about that virus type.
[16:25.820 --> 16:29.820]  The size of a virus, but I'm not sure if it was actually a virus,
[16:29.820 --> 16:37.820]  but a new microorganism that has been discovered riding along with the GMOs.
[16:37.820 --> 16:39.820]  It's been discovered in the animals that are fed the GMOs.
[16:39.820 --> 16:43.820]  And he talked about how all these animals that are fed GMOs do so much better
[16:43.820 --> 16:45.820]  when they get to a non-GMO diet.
[16:45.820 --> 16:48.820]  So I immediately began to think this could be a GMO issue.
[16:48.820 --> 16:53.820]  Maybe these lambs are being fed GMOs and they're being born with all these weird deformities.
[16:53.820 --> 16:55.820]  I don't know that for sure, but it's something to check out.
[16:55.820 --> 17:03.820]  We do know that GMOs cause all kinds of infertility and that's clearly not a good situation.
[17:03.820 --> 17:08.820]  TSA airport checkpoint left unattended in Sacramento.
[17:08.820 --> 17:09.820]  Yes, indeed.
[17:09.820 --> 17:15.820]  The TSA quote officers, shouldn't even call them officers.
[17:15.820 --> 17:19.820]  The minimum wage TSA employees, whatever they are,
[17:19.820 --> 17:25.820]  they left their post and five people got past this unattended security checkpoint.
[17:25.820 --> 17:27.820]  As a result of the incident, here's the funny part.
[17:27.820 --> 17:31.820]  The officials said, again this is TSA officials,
[17:31.820 --> 17:35.820]  they said that two TSA officers have been removed from screening duties
[17:35.820 --> 17:38.820]  and are to undergo additional training.
[17:38.820 --> 17:44.820]  Like what their initial training didn't include stay at your post.
[17:44.820 --> 17:54.820]  If you can't get that part of it down, what hope do you have as a government oppressive moron thug
[17:54.820 --> 17:57.820]  working at the airport reaching down people's pants?
[17:57.820 --> 17:58.820]  You can't even stay at your post.
[17:58.820 --> 18:01.820]  I mean, isn't that the most basic thing that the TSA is supposed to do?
[18:01.820 --> 18:03.820]  Just stay at your post.
[18:03.820 --> 18:06.820]  Can't even do that.
[18:06.820 --> 18:09.820]  Let's see, I got something for you here.
[18:09.820 --> 18:13.820]  Last week some news came out that vaccines are being developed for Salmonella.
[18:13.820 --> 18:17.820]  Yeah, this is a foodborne disease, a foodborne microbe.
[18:17.820 --> 18:21.820]  Salmonella, it's not like you, the person, get Salmonella.
[18:21.820 --> 18:23.820]  It's usually in the food and then you consume the food.
[18:23.820 --> 18:26.820]  Well, they're trying to come out with a vaccine for Salmonella
[18:26.820 --> 18:29.820]  and they're saying that's going to save everybody from all this contaminated food.
[18:29.820 --> 18:31.820]  What are they going to come out with next?
[18:31.820 --> 18:33.820]  A vaccine not only for every microbe and a human being,
[18:33.820 --> 18:37.820]  but a vaccine for every microbe that might infect some food.
[18:37.820 --> 18:41.820]  And it got me thinking that vaccines for all the useless stuff,
[18:41.820 --> 18:44.820]  but not enough vaccines for the stuff we really need.
[18:44.820 --> 18:46.820]  So guys, prep that music in that slideshow.
[18:46.820 --> 18:48.820]  Let me know when you're ready.
[18:48.820 --> 18:51.820]  I've got a little bit here about top 10 vaccines we really need.
[18:51.820 --> 18:53.820]  Let me know when that's ready.
[18:53.820 --> 18:55.820]  Instead of the vaccines we're actually getting,
[18:55.820 --> 18:58.820]  because the vaccines we're actually getting are things like dropping vaccines
[18:58.820 --> 19:00.820]  for coyotes and rabbits and skunks and turtles.
[19:00.820 --> 19:02.820]  Now they're actually dropping them on wildlife.
[19:02.820 --> 19:05.820]  So here are the top 10 vaccines that we really need.
[19:05.820 --> 19:09.820]  Go ahead.
[19:09.820 --> 19:12.820]  Got that music?
[19:12.820 --> 19:13.820]  Nope.
[19:13.820 --> 19:15.820]  Yeah, it's coming up.
[19:15.820 --> 19:16.820]  It's coming up shortly.
[19:16.820 --> 19:17.820]  All right.
[19:17.820 --> 19:21.820]  Until we get to that, we've got, let's go to the UK, is run out of money.
[19:21.820 --> 19:24.820]  George Osborne says, obviously he's the chancellor.
[19:24.820 --> 19:27.820]  He says, next month's budget has run out of money.
[19:27.820 --> 19:29.820]  Quote, the British government has run out of money
[19:29.820 --> 19:33.820]  because all the money was spent in the good years.
[19:33.820 --> 19:34.820]  What do we got here?
[19:34.820 --> 19:35.820]  Okay.
[19:35.820 --> 19:36.820]  All right.
[19:36.820 --> 19:39.820]  The money and investments in the jobs need to come from the private sector.
[19:39.820 --> 19:41.820]  He says, now, can you imagine that?
[19:41.820 --> 19:44.820]  The private sector, you mean, might be our savior for the budget?
[19:44.820 --> 19:46.820]  We'll have more on that.
[19:46.820 --> 19:48.820]  And plus, the top 10 vaccines we really need, as I promised,
[19:48.820 --> 19:51.820]  we'll be rolling with that on the other side of this break.
[19:51.820 --> 19:53.820]  We've got a lot more coming up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[19:53.820 --> 19:54.820]  Stay with us.
[19:54.820 --> 19:56.820]  Mike Adams filling in for Alex today.
[19:56.820 --> 20:07.820]  We'll be right back after this break.
[20:26.820 --> 20:52.820]  We'll be right back.
[20:52.820 --> 21:18.820]  We'll be right back.
[21:18.820 --> 21:44.820]  We'll be right back.
[21:44.820 --> 22:10.820]  We'll be right back.
[22:10.820 --> 22:36.820]  We'll be right back.
[22:36.820 --> 22:58.820]  We'll be right back.
[22:58.820 --> 23:01.820]  In the past, I've taken a lot of different vitamins,
[23:01.820 --> 23:04.820]  some through health food stores, some that friends recommend.
[23:04.820 --> 23:07.820]  Colleen talking about her experience with Super Sea Veg.
[23:07.820 --> 23:10.820]  And with the Super Sea Veg, I was seeing a lot better results.
[23:10.820 --> 23:16.820]  Super Sea Veg with Vita D and Sea Cal is the most powerful dietary food supplement in the world today,
[23:16.820 --> 23:17.820]  and nothing else comes close.
[23:17.820 --> 23:21.820]  Super Sea Veg is a whole food that makes me feel good.
[23:21.820 --> 23:24.820]  Think of Super Sea Veg as the un-vitamin.
[23:24.820 --> 23:27.820]  I have taken other things, and they just didn't work.
[23:27.820 --> 23:28.820]  This seems to work for me.
[23:28.820 --> 23:31.820]  And Super Sea Veg comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee.
[23:31.820 --> 23:34.820]  Store-bought vitamins do not have the supplement
[23:34.820 --> 23:37.820]  and the full, whole feeling I have from Super Sea Veg.

[23:50.820 --> 23:54.820]  That's 866-732-8344.
[23:54.820 --> 24:01.820]  Eating Super Sea Veg daily is eating right.
[24:01.820 --> 24:11.820]  Yeah, there's all kinds of crazy breaking news today as usual.
[24:11.820 --> 24:13.820]  We've got the school shooting that we already mentioned,
[24:13.820 --> 24:18.820]  which again, the mainstream hoax media will try to use that to blame it on guns.
[24:18.820 --> 24:21.820]  And in fact, we're going to cover that issue that Alex talked about yesterday
[24:21.820 --> 24:27.820]  about the school girl, the four-year-old who drew a picture of her dad with a gun.
[24:27.820 --> 24:31.820]  And then the police arrested the man and strip searched him,
[24:31.820 --> 24:35.820]  saying that he was being arrested for possession, illegal possession of a firearm.
[24:35.820 --> 24:37.820]  What if her dad was a cop?
[24:37.820 --> 24:41.820]  What if her dad was a fireman and she drew an ax?
[24:41.820 --> 24:46.820]  What if her dad was a paramedic and she drew a picture of a knife
[24:46.820 --> 24:49.820]  that you use to rescue people when they're stuck in their seatbelts in their cars?
[24:49.820 --> 24:52.820]  I mean, it's ridiculous. We'll get it more into that later.
[24:52.820 --> 24:55.820]  But let's go to the top 10 things we really need a vaccine for.
[24:55.820 --> 24:57.820]  This should be fun and interesting.
[24:57.820 --> 25:00.820]  And this is a little comedy bit about vaccines that we do need instead of the ones they give us.
[25:00.820 --> 25:02.820]  Go ahead and roll that.
[25:02.820 --> 25:07.820]  Number one, we need a vaccine for resisting mass media brainwashing, the CNN jab.
[25:07.820 --> 25:10.820]  Instead of the MMR, we just call it the CNN.
[25:10.820 --> 25:12.820]  Did you get your CNN yet?
[25:12.820 --> 25:15.820]  Number two, we need a vaccine that blocks the toxic effects of BPA,
[25:15.820 --> 25:21.820]  the hormone-mimicking plastics chemical that creates man boobs in those who eat too much of it.
[25:21.820 --> 25:25.820]  Number three, we need a vaccine that shields us from the magical paralyzing hideousness
[25:25.820 --> 25:29.820]  of Janet Napolitano's face like the Medusa.
[25:29.820 --> 25:34.820]  Number four, we need a vaccine that protects us from the brain-damaging metals found in vaccines.
[25:34.820 --> 25:38.820]  So before you get your flu shot, you first get your aluminum vaccine
[25:38.820 --> 25:41.820]  so that you're immune to the aluminum in the flu shot.
[25:41.820 --> 25:45.820]  Number five, we need a vaccine that boosts immune defenses against GMOs
[25:45.820 --> 25:49.820]  and causes you to just involuntarily chuck those GMOs right back up.
[25:49.820 --> 25:52.820]  Hey, grocery manager, can I get my money back on this?
[25:52.820 --> 25:57.820]  Number six, we need a vaccine that we can give the vaccine-pimping doctors
[25:57.820 --> 26:01.820]  that will cure them of being total big pharma whore zombies.
[26:01.820 --> 26:05.820]  Number seven, we need a vaccine that can help you find a parking spot.
[26:05.820 --> 26:10.820]  Yeah, take the shot, find your spot, you get the jab if you need it or not.
[26:10.820 --> 26:16.820]  Number eight, how about having a vaccine that simply protects people from being total morons when they vote?
[26:16.820 --> 26:20.820]  It would activate extra brain cells before anybody punches a hanging chad
[26:20.820 --> 26:23.820]  and accidentally votes for Obama again.
[26:23.820 --> 26:28.820]  Oh no. Number nine, we need a mental vaccine that protects people from false authority brainwashing.
[26:28.820 --> 26:32.820]  So when the government screams, give up your rights to be safe from terrorism,
[26:32.820 --> 26:37.820]  your brain goes, huh? But the government created the terrorism. Weird.
[26:37.820 --> 26:41.820]  Again, when you have a mandatory vaccine for politicians that makes them tell the truth.
[26:41.820 --> 26:44.820]  Mr. Obama, are you an American citizen? No.
[26:44.820 --> 26:48.820]  Mr. Bernanke, are you trying to destroy the U.S. economy? Yes.
[26:48.820 --> 26:53.820]  Mr. Romney, are you taking orders from organic aliens who are trying to geo-engineer the planet
[26:53.820 --> 26:59.820]  for extraterrestrial colonization? Yes! Yes! Yes!
[26:59.820 --> 27:03.820]  There you go. That was the top ten vaccines we really need.
[27:03.820 --> 27:07.820]  My apologies to all those celebrities named in that bid.
[27:07.820 --> 27:09.820]  It's obviously satire and humor. Hope you enjoyed it.
[27:09.820 --> 27:12.820]  Now we do have more humor coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[27:12.820 --> 27:17.820]  But of course, there's a serious message. Every time we do satire, we're expressing our first amendment rights.
[27:17.820 --> 27:19.820]  We do cover real issues in that.
[27:19.820 --> 27:24.820]  So the issue obviously that we're reflecting in that is that we have vaccines for all these silly things
[27:24.820 --> 27:27.820]  like a salmonella and like the measles or chicken pox.
[27:27.820 --> 27:32.820]  Remember when you used to just get the chicken pox and then you overcame it and you were perfectly fine
[27:32.820 --> 27:33.820]  and you never get it again?
[27:33.820 --> 27:38.820]  Now they have chicken pox vaccines because apparently there's something wrong with getting the chicken pox.
[27:38.820 --> 27:44.820]  No, that is practice for your immune system to be strong, to get the chicken pox, to get the measles.
[27:44.820 --> 27:48.820]  A healthy body can throw off those infections without any problems.
[27:48.820 --> 27:50.820]  Just like I'm throwing off a slight infection today.
[27:50.820 --> 27:53.820]  You know, immune system is working just fine, getting some practice.
[27:53.820 --> 27:58.820]  It's like going to the gym and working out with some weights to build up your musculature, right?
[27:58.820 --> 28:00.820]  It's just good practice.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.820]  Let's draw with practicing your immune system.
[28:02.820 --> 28:03.820]  All right.
[28:03.820 --> 28:07.820]  By the way, vaccines are marketed much like terrorism.
[28:07.820 --> 28:08.820]  Have you ever noticed that?
[28:08.820 --> 28:10.820]  It's designed to scare you into compliance.
[28:10.820 --> 28:14.820]  Like terrorism, they say, oh, today's a yellow alert or orange alert or red alert.
[28:14.820 --> 28:15.820]  It's designed to scare you.
[28:15.820 --> 28:20.820]  Oh, Iran might have enough material to develop a bomb and they're going to bomb the Statue of Liberty.
[28:20.820 --> 28:21.820]  All this other nonsense.
[28:21.820 --> 28:24.820]  Vaccines are promoted with the exact same kind of warped logic.
[28:24.820 --> 28:31.820]  Oh, there's been an outbreak, seven children in a school got measles, so all the unvaccinated kids have to be sent home.
[28:31.820 --> 28:33.820]  Wait a minute.
[28:33.820 --> 28:37.820]  If vaccines protect the vaccinated kids, why are they afraid of the unvaccinated kids?
[28:37.820 --> 28:38.820]  Tell me that again.
[28:38.820 --> 28:43.820]  And if you check the outbreak, it happened among those who were vaccinated.
[28:43.820 --> 28:47.820]  See, that's the other thing the mainstream media, hoax media, never tells you.
[28:47.820 --> 28:51.820]  Every one of these outbreaks happens among children who have been vaccinated.
[28:51.820 --> 28:55.820]  When there's a measles outbreak, it's children who are vaccinated against the measles.
[28:55.820 --> 28:59.820]  When there's a chickenpox outbreak, it's often children who are vaccinated against chickenpox.
[28:59.820 --> 29:01.820]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[29:01.820 --> 29:05.820]  When there's a flu outbreak, it's among those who are vaccinated against the flu.
[29:05.820 --> 29:09.820]  So see, the logic just never, never holds up.
[29:09.820 --> 29:10.820]  All right.
[29:10.820 --> 29:12.820]  We have time for this.
[29:12.820 --> 29:14.820]  Man, the drones.
[29:14.820 --> 29:17.820]  Not that much time, I know, but we got to get into this.
[29:17.820 --> 29:32.820]  I tell you, I get into this more at the top of the next hour, but the Federal Aviation Administration has announced a timeline now where they're going to have drones flying all over the skies of America for police stations and fire stations and even, you know, traffic control.
[29:32.820 --> 29:34.820]  Yeah, it's all about spying on you.
[29:34.820 --> 29:36.820]  You know that.
[29:36.820 --> 29:38.820]  We'll give you that news coming up.
[29:38.820 --> 29:49.820]  Plus, a sound bit from Patty Finn, an attorney who is being tyrannized by the government for her anti-vaccination legal actions, much more coming up.

[31:00.820 --> 31:04.820]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[31:04.820 --> 31:07.820]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[31:07.820 --> 31:12.820]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[31:12.820 --> 31:18.820]  As soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[31:18.820 --> 31:29.820]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at eFoodsDirect.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[31:29.820 --> 31:34.820]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[31:34.820 --> 31:40.820]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[31:40.820 --> 31:42.820]  Now that's results.

[32:12.820 --> 32:20.820]  There's a place down at Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[32:20.820 --> 32:28.820]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[32:28.820 --> 32:37.820]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it.
[32:37.820 --> 32:39.820]  Others don't.
[32:39.820 --> 32:45.820]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[33:27.820 --> 33:30.820]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in for Alex Jones.
[33:30.820 --> 33:38.820]  We've got Ian Varela, a ventriloquist here joining us in the studio for the next segment.
[33:38.820 --> 33:44.820]  Hold on a second. Well, he's got his character, Old Man Gramps, who's going crazy over here.
[33:44.820 --> 33:46.820]  Apparently Old Man Gramps.
[33:46.820 --> 33:49.820]  I am not happy.
[33:49.820 --> 33:50.820]  Apparently he's not.
[33:50.820 --> 33:52.820]  Anyway, we want to welcome Ian to the show.
[33:52.820 --> 33:56.820]  He's live here in studio and for those of you on the radio,
[33:56.820 --> 33:58.820]  you'll be able to hear his character voice.
[33:58.820 --> 34:00.820]  For those of you watching on PrismPlanet.tv,
[34:00.820 --> 34:03.820]  you'll be able to see the comedy and Ian's website.
[34:03.820 --> 34:08.820]  That's where I only have people see your lips moving.
[34:08.820 --> 34:09.820]  Very good.
[34:09.820 --> 34:12.820]  The website for Ian is comedyvent.com.
[34:12.820 --> 34:14.820]  Comedyvent short for ventriloquist.
[34:14.820 --> 34:16.820]  Comedyventriloquist.
[34:16.820 --> 34:17.820]  It's hard to say.
[34:17.820 --> 34:18.820]  Stop moving your lips.
[34:18.820 --> 34:19.820]  You say it then.
[34:19.820 --> 34:20.820]  I'll say it.
[34:20.820 --> 34:21.820]  All right, so Old Man Gramps.
[34:21.820 --> 34:22.820]  Yeah.
[34:22.820 --> 34:24.820]  Are you your farmer from Central Texas?
[34:24.820 --> 34:25.820]  All right.
[34:25.820 --> 34:26.820]  What's your deal?
[34:26.820 --> 34:27.820]  Where are you from?
[34:27.820 --> 34:28.820]  I'm a chicken farmer.
[34:28.820 --> 34:29.820]  Chicken farmer.
[34:29.820 --> 34:32.820]  Chicken farmer from San Antonio.
[34:32.820 --> 34:33.820]  Oh, yeah.
[34:33.820 --> 34:34.820]  Yeah.
[34:34.820 --> 34:35.820]  Yeah.
[34:35.820 --> 34:38.820]  Lost a lot of chickens last year.
[34:38.820 --> 34:39.820]  What happened?
[34:39.820 --> 34:41.820]  I think I planted too deep.
[34:41.820 --> 34:42.820]  You planted too deep.
[34:42.820 --> 34:43.820]  Yeah.
[34:43.820 --> 34:44.820]  That's horrible.
[34:44.820 --> 34:45.820]  I know.
[34:45.820 --> 34:48.820]  I should have planted farther apart.
[34:48.820 --> 34:49.820]  I don't know.
[34:49.820 --> 34:52.820]  Now, when we talked before the show, Gramps,
[34:52.820 --> 34:55.820]  you mentioned the government was giving you a hard time
[34:55.820 --> 34:56.820]  with some of your farming practices.
[34:56.820 --> 34:58.820]  What was going on with that?
[34:58.820 --> 35:04.820]  Oh, it turned by the lack of poison in the chickens.
[35:04.820 --> 35:05.820]  What?
[35:05.820 --> 35:07.820]  They poisoned the chickens.
[35:07.820 --> 35:08.820]  With what?
[35:08.820 --> 35:09.820]  Poison.
[35:09.820 --> 35:11.820]  That's what they think.
[35:11.820 --> 35:15.820]  I think that was the corn that...
[35:15.820 --> 35:17.820]  Oh, that genetically modified corn.
[35:17.820 --> 35:19.820]  Is that what it stands for?
[35:19.820 --> 35:20.820]  Yeah, GM corn.
[35:20.820 --> 35:22.820]  Oh, I thought that was a new car.
[35:22.820 --> 35:25.820]  The General Motors was coming out with it.
[35:25.820 --> 35:26.820]  No.
[35:26.820 --> 35:27.820]  No?
[35:27.820 --> 35:28.820]  Oh, no.
[35:28.820 --> 35:29.820]  Genetically mutated.
[35:29.820 --> 35:30.820]  Oh, it's different.
[35:30.820 --> 35:31.820]  Okay.
[35:31.820 --> 35:34.820]  So what happened to your chickens when they ate that GM corn?
[35:34.820 --> 35:36.820]  Well, I came back there and, you know,
[35:36.820 --> 35:41.820]  it looked like the final scene from the newly scarred face.
[35:41.820 --> 35:42.820]  What final scene?
[35:42.820 --> 35:46.820]  You know, the dead people all over the place.
[35:46.820 --> 35:49.820]  Come and meet my little friend.
[35:49.820 --> 35:51.820]  You horrible.
[35:51.820 --> 35:52.820]  What about the EPA?
[35:52.820 --> 35:54.820]  Do they leave you alone out there?
[35:54.820 --> 35:55.820]  Or do they pretty much give you...
[35:55.820 --> 35:56.820]  No.
[35:56.820 --> 35:59.820]  Turn that dust thing.
[35:59.820 --> 36:00.820]  Geez.
[36:00.820 --> 36:02.820]  They don't even call it dust anymore.
[36:02.820 --> 36:03.820]  That's why they don't call it.
[36:03.820 --> 36:06.820]  They got a real fancy name for dust.
[36:06.820 --> 36:07.820]  What do they call it?
[36:07.820 --> 36:08.820]  Something that...
[36:08.820 --> 36:11.820]  God, I wish I had a note with me.
[36:11.820 --> 36:15.820]  It's granulated particles.
[36:15.820 --> 36:16.820]  Granulated particles?
[36:16.820 --> 36:18.820]  Yeah, or something like that.
[36:18.820 --> 36:19.820]  What do you think about that gran?
[36:19.820 --> 36:21.820]  I think that's a big heat, the toaster,
[36:21.820 --> 36:23.820]  digestive, cattle feed.
[36:23.820 --> 36:24.820]  Well, wait a minute.
[36:24.820 --> 36:26.820]  Where is the dust even coming from?
[36:26.820 --> 36:27.820]  From the tractor.
[36:27.820 --> 36:29.820]  So you're driving a tractor, you're making dust,
[36:29.820 --> 36:31.820]  and the EPA is giving you a hard time?
[36:31.820 --> 36:33.820]  So now I got a new kind of tractor.
[36:33.820 --> 36:34.820]  What kind?
[36:34.820 --> 36:35.820]  Orac.
[36:35.820 --> 36:36.820]  What?
[36:36.820 --> 36:37.820]  Orac.
[36:37.820 --> 36:39.820]  I think they got the vacuum cleaner.
[36:39.820 --> 36:41.820]  They got the HEPA filter.
[36:41.820 --> 36:44.820]  And what's an Orac tractor do?
[36:44.820 --> 36:46.820]  Less dust.
[36:46.820 --> 36:49.820]  I see.
[36:49.820 --> 36:50.820]  I see.
[36:50.820 --> 36:51.820]  Clever guy.
[36:51.820 --> 36:52.820]  I ain't telling you.
[36:52.820 --> 36:55.820]  I got an answer for everything.
[36:55.820 --> 36:56.820]  All right.
[36:56.820 --> 36:57.820]  So you're into farming.
[36:57.820 --> 36:58.820]  You're into sustainable living.
[36:58.820 --> 36:59.820]  It sounds like...
[36:59.820 --> 37:00.820]  Yes.
[37:00.820 --> 37:01.820]  You into green living?
[37:01.820 --> 37:02.820]  Oh, sure.
[37:02.820 --> 37:06.820]  I got lots of weeds around our house.
[37:06.820 --> 37:09.820]  Being good to the environment.
[37:09.820 --> 37:10.820]  Oh, sure.
[37:10.820 --> 37:11.820]  Yeah.
[37:11.820 --> 37:12.820]  Yeah.
[37:12.820 --> 37:14.820]  Thanks to that genetically mutated corn there.
[37:14.820 --> 37:16.820]  Then chickens are so big, I don't need a car.
[37:16.820 --> 37:20.820]  I can just saddle up and ride into town.
[37:20.820 --> 37:21.820]  Okay.
[37:21.820 --> 37:22.820]  What about the economy?
[37:22.820 --> 37:25.820]  How's that affecting you out there in your farming operation?
[37:25.820 --> 37:27.820]  I'm telling you what.
[37:27.820 --> 37:28.820]  I know.
[37:28.820 --> 37:29.820]  I know.
[37:29.820 --> 37:30.820]  I know.
[37:30.820 --> 37:31.820]  I know.
[37:31.820 --> 37:32.820]  I know.
[37:32.820 --> 37:33.820]  I know.
[37:33.820 --> 37:34.820]  I know.
[37:34.820 --> 37:35.820]  I know.
[37:35.820 --> 37:36.820]  I know.
[37:36.820 --> 37:37.820]  I know.
[37:37.820 --> 37:38.820]  I know.
[37:38.820 --> 37:39.820]  I know.
[37:39.820 --> 37:40.820]  I know.
[37:40.820 --> 37:41.820]  I know.
[37:41.820 --> 37:42.820]  I know.
[37:42.820 --> 37:44.820]  I know.
[37:44.820 --> 37:45.820]  I know.
[37:45.820 --> 37:46.820]  I know.
[37:46.820 --> 37:47.820]  I know.
[37:47.820 --> 38:11.820]  And...
[38:11.820 --> 38:14.380]  Paul, speaking of politics, you mentioned Ron Paul, you mentioned the gold standard.
[38:14.380 --> 38:19.460]  What do you think about the politicians vying for the Republican nomination right now?
[38:19.460 --> 38:21.380]  Oh, I hope they do something.
[38:21.380 --> 38:23.500]  I hope they deal with Rocky.
[38:23.500 --> 38:24.500]  Yeah, I like Rocky.
[38:24.500 --> 38:26.500]  I don't like him.
[38:26.500 --> 38:31.540]  I kind of glad he got elected though, because it got him off my back.
[38:31.540 --> 38:32.540]  He was on your back.
[38:32.540 --> 38:33.540]  How was that?
[38:33.540 --> 38:34.540]  In three days.
[38:34.540 --> 38:38.660]  Come up, ask me for change.
[38:38.660 --> 38:41.500]  I think that was his campaign slogan.
[38:41.500 --> 38:42.500]  Yeah.
[38:42.500 --> 38:43.500]  We need change.
[38:43.500 --> 38:44.500]  Oh, change from what?
[38:44.500 --> 38:47.380]  Yeah, that's what I want to know.
[38:47.380 --> 38:49.340]  Well, not much has changed, actually.
[38:49.340 --> 38:50.860]  That's the bad part about it.
[38:50.860 --> 38:54.260]  What do you think about Mitt Romney?
[38:54.260 --> 38:56.260]  Mitt Romney.
[38:56.260 --> 38:59.260]  Mitt Romney.
[38:59.260 --> 39:02.260]  Mitt Romney.
[39:02.260 --> 39:08.300]  I haven't really kept up too well in the news.
[39:08.300 --> 39:09.780]  What's up with Mitt Romney?
[39:09.780 --> 39:12.020]  Well, I mean, he's the latest globalist.
[39:12.020 --> 39:14.620]  He's sort of like Obama, but white.
[39:14.620 --> 39:18.140]  I mean, he's just the same policies, the same everything, just that-
[39:18.140 --> 39:19.140]  Obama's not white?
[39:19.140 --> 39:20.140]  Oh, man.
[39:20.140 --> 39:21.140]  Okay, what about-
[39:21.140 --> 39:22.140]  He's hath lack, hath Christian, hath Muslim.
[39:22.140 --> 39:23.140]  What about Santorum?
[39:23.140 --> 39:24.140]  What are you-
[39:24.140 --> 39:39.140]  Oh, I tell you, he's a- he's a- he's a- he's a- he isn't watching news very often.
[39:39.140 --> 39:41.540]  That sounds like Gramps has a little bit of an asthma problem.
[39:41.540 --> 39:42.540]  Is he-
[39:42.540 --> 39:43.540]  I got a little daddy.
[39:43.540 --> 39:48.020]  I launched some medication there and it's making me kinda-
[39:48.020 --> 39:49.020]  Okay.
[39:49.020 --> 39:50.020]  Get out.
[39:50.020 --> 39:51.020]  Not now.
[39:51.020 --> 39:52.020]  All right.
[39:52.020 --> 39:55.020]  So a little too much on the-
[39:55.020 --> 39:56.020]  Not now, Gladys.
[39:56.020 --> 39:57.020]  Get someone.
[39:57.020 --> 39:58.020]  Did that last week.
[39:58.020 --> 39:59.020]  Get-
[39:59.020 --> 40:00.020]  A little up.
[40:00.020 --> 40:01.020]  Rest in peace.
[40:01.020 --> 40:02.020]  Oh, no.
[40:02.020 --> 40:03.020]  Oh, no.
[40:03.020 --> 40:04.020]  All right.
[40:04.020 --> 40:09.020]  So it sounds like he's got a- he's got a medication benefit under Obamacare or something.
[40:09.020 --> 40:10.020]  How's he-
[40:10.020 --> 40:11.020]  I got me a health plan.
[40:11.020 --> 40:12.020]  Yeah.
[40:12.020 --> 40:13.020]  What's your health plan, Gramps?
[40:13.020 --> 40:14.020]  Don't get sick.
[40:14.020 --> 40:15.020]  Okay.
[40:15.020 --> 40:20.540]  I went to him, the doctor, and he's trying to save money.
[40:20.540 --> 40:25.020]  I had a really bad cough, just like you did, and he gave me coughs.
[40:25.020 --> 40:26.020]  He gave me lacticide.
[40:26.020 --> 40:28.820]  Give you lacticide for your cough.
[40:28.820 --> 40:29.820]  Yeah.
[40:29.820 --> 40:30.820]  That makes you stop coughing.
[40:30.820 --> 40:32.820]  Makes you afraid to cough.
[40:32.820 --> 40:33.820]  Oh, my.
[40:33.820 --> 40:34.820]  Oh, my.
[40:34.820 --> 40:35.820]  Yeah.
[40:35.820 --> 40:36.820]  All right.
[40:36.820 --> 40:40.700]  Ian, let me ask you a question.
[40:40.700 --> 40:42.180]  Just me to you here for a second.
[40:42.180 --> 40:43.180]  All right.
[40:43.180 --> 40:44.180]  Take a break.
[40:44.180 --> 40:45.180]  You can take a break now.
[40:45.180 --> 40:46.900]  So Gramps is one of your characters.
[40:46.900 --> 40:52.420]  You've got a number of characters that- can you describe some of your other characters?
[40:52.420 --> 40:53.620]  Oh, we got Alfred.
[40:53.620 --> 40:55.620]  I hate that little- I know.
[40:55.620 --> 40:57.820]  They don't get along too well.
[40:57.820 --> 40:59.620]  Alfred's kind of a Muppet type character.
[40:59.620 --> 41:02.020]  He's always gets me in a lot of trouble.
[41:02.020 --> 41:08.420]  We got a puller of one time for speeding, and that's another show, but Gray Alfens says
[41:08.420 --> 41:09.420]  Sancho.
[41:09.420 --> 41:10.420]  Oh, Sancho.
[41:10.420 --> 41:11.420]  Yeah.
[41:11.420 --> 41:12.420]  Yeah.
[41:12.420 --> 41:13.420]  He's from south of the border.
[41:13.420 --> 41:14.420]  He's from the capital of Mexico.
[41:14.420 --> 41:15.420]  Phoenix.
[41:15.420 --> 41:22.220]  And he's a- Do you find that people are really open to comedy right now these days?
[41:22.220 --> 41:25.020]  I mean, there's a lot of stress out there in the political environment, and you're able
[41:25.020 --> 41:26.020]  to cover these topics.
[41:26.020 --> 41:28.020]  Oh, everybody needs a laugh.
[41:28.020 --> 41:29.020]  Especially now.
[41:29.020 --> 41:30.020]  Especially now.
[41:30.020 --> 41:31.020]  Yeah.
[41:31.020 --> 41:32.020]  All right.
[41:32.020 --> 41:33.020]  We're going back to Gramps.
[41:33.020 --> 41:34.020]  So what are your plans, Gramps?
[41:34.020 --> 41:37.520]  Are you fighting back against the EPA on this dust issue?
[41:37.520 --> 41:38.520]  Yes.
[41:38.520 --> 41:41.020]  I was fighting back on the ETA there.
[41:41.020 --> 41:47.020]  They killed my chickens, so I'm going to get them back and take them all out to lunch.
[41:47.020 --> 41:48.020]  The EPA?
[41:48.020 --> 41:49.020]  Yeah.
[41:49.020 --> 41:50.020]  Where are you going?
[41:50.020 --> 41:51.020]  Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[41:51.020 --> 41:53.020]  What do you think about this issue?
[41:53.020 --> 41:56.020]  A glass of milk.
[41:56.020 --> 41:59.020]  Mystery virus kills thousands of lambs in the UK.
[41:59.020 --> 42:01.020]  Okay.
[42:01.020 --> 42:03.020]  Look at that.
[42:03.020 --> 42:07.020]  This issue goes a lot of people's social lives.
[42:07.020 --> 42:08.020]  Keep it clean.
[42:08.020 --> 42:13.020]  These lambs are being born with serious deformities such as fused limbs and twisted necks.
[42:13.020 --> 42:14.020]  Yes.
[42:14.020 --> 42:15.020]  Yeah.
[42:15.020 --> 42:16.020]  You know what they're going to do?
[42:16.020 --> 42:17.020]  They're going to...
[42:17.020 --> 42:20.020]  You know where a virgin wolf comes from, don't you?
[42:20.020 --> 42:21.020]  No.
[42:21.020 --> 42:22.020]  Ugly sheep.
[42:22.020 --> 42:23.020]  Oh, my.
[42:23.020 --> 42:24.020]  Oh, my.
[42:24.020 --> 42:28.020]  Apologize to our listeners for the off-color humor.
[42:28.020 --> 42:29.020]  It's not off-color.
[42:29.020 --> 42:30.020]  All right.
[42:30.020 --> 42:31.020]  Whatever you say, Grabs.
[42:31.020 --> 42:32.020]  Nolander virus.
[42:32.020 --> 42:33.020]  Good night.
[42:33.020 --> 42:34.020]  All right.
[42:34.020 --> 42:37.020]  So what do you think the future of farming is in America then?
[42:37.020 --> 42:41.020]  With all this oppression going on of farmers, what about the raw milk issue?
[42:41.020 --> 42:46.020]  The raw milk farmers are being arrested at gunpoint for milking their cows and trying to sell their milk.
[42:46.020 --> 42:47.020]  Really?
[42:47.020 --> 42:48.020]  Yeah.
[42:48.020 --> 42:49.020]  That happened to the Amish.
[42:49.020 --> 42:50.020]  You're not Amish, are you?
[42:50.020 --> 42:51.020]  Oh, no.
[42:51.020 --> 42:52.020]  No.
[42:52.020 --> 42:53.020]  I'm on TV.
[42:53.020 --> 42:55.020]  You know how the Amish can't check?
[42:55.020 --> 43:00.020]  How harsh they sneak up behind it and they build a barn around it.
[43:00.020 --> 43:03.020]  I didn't know that.
[43:03.020 --> 43:07.020]  Are you going to be at the raw milk freedom event coming up this week?
[43:07.020 --> 43:08.020]  Raw milk.
[43:08.020 --> 43:09.020]  That's a good stuff.
[43:09.020 --> 43:11.020]  I'm going to bring a bucket or two.
[43:11.020 --> 43:12.020]  I got some vintage.
[43:12.020 --> 43:13.020]  That's good stuff.
[43:13.020 --> 43:14.020]  Yeah.
[43:14.020 --> 43:18.020]  So he's not really up to date on the raw milk freedom.
[43:18.020 --> 43:20.020]  I'm not really up on these things.
[43:20.020 --> 43:29.020]  I had a wiki leak last week that I'm wearing the pens now, so I'm all right.
[43:29.020 --> 43:31.020]  Well, you are up on it.
[43:31.020 --> 43:32.020]  Wiki leaks did.
[43:32.020 --> 43:35.020]  That was breaking news today.
[43:35.020 --> 43:36.020]  Yeah.
[43:36.020 --> 43:38.020]  In fact, what happened?
[43:38.020 --> 43:40.020]  I missed it.
[43:40.020 --> 43:43.020]  You got to really get up on things.
[43:43.020 --> 43:44.020]  I guess so.
[43:44.020 --> 43:45.020]  Look who's working me.
[43:45.020 --> 43:46.020]  All right.
[43:46.020 --> 43:47.020]  All right.
[43:47.020 --> 43:50.020]  So where are you playing Ian?
[43:50.020 --> 43:53.020]  Where do you get the gramps out to talk to people about current events?
[43:53.020 --> 43:57.020]  A lot of our shows are private corporate shows for banquets and did a show.
[43:57.020 --> 44:01.020]  It seems like a lot of the companies we're working for now used to be other companies.
[44:01.020 --> 44:02.020]  And they got bought out.
[44:02.020 --> 44:03.020]  They got bought out.
[44:03.020 --> 44:05.020]  They have new merger names.
[44:05.020 --> 44:06.020]  Oh yeah.
[44:06.020 --> 44:08.020]  Did a show for 3M.
[44:08.020 --> 44:13.020]  They just acquired Goodyear and they got a great new, what's their new name?
[44:13.020 --> 44:14.020]  Good.
[44:14.020 --> 44:16.020]  That's right.
[44:16.020 --> 44:20.020]  People who make great Poupon mustard just bought out the Levi Strauss Corporation and
[44:20.020 --> 44:24.020]  their new name is Poupon Tants.
[44:24.020 --> 44:28.020]  You ever do any events for globalist elitist corporations?
[44:28.020 --> 44:29.020]  Rockefellers?
[44:29.020 --> 44:30.020]  Hell yeah.
[44:30.020 --> 44:31.020]  Don Santo?
[44:31.020 --> 44:32.020]  DuPont?
[44:32.020 --> 44:33.020]  Nope.
[44:33.020 --> 44:37.020]  Well, we didn't, so many, you know.
[44:37.020 --> 44:40.020]  It's really hard to keep track of what we've done.
[44:40.020 --> 44:41.020]  Yeah.
[44:41.020 --> 44:44.020]  We do a lot of work and we're going to be in Louisville.
[44:44.020 --> 44:45.020]  Louisville.
[44:45.020 --> 44:46.020]  Louisville.
[44:46.020 --> 44:47.020]  Louisville.
[44:47.020 --> 44:48.020]  We're doing a comedy club.
[44:48.020 --> 44:49.020]  Comedy club.
[44:49.020 --> 44:50.020]  Yes, sure.
[44:50.020 --> 44:52.020]  There's your comedy caravan the last weekend.
[44:52.020 --> 44:53.020]  All right.
[44:53.020 --> 44:55.020]  For those listening, just let me give everybody an update.
[44:55.020 --> 44:57.020]  This is the Alice Jones show.
[44:57.020 --> 44:59.020]  We've got a comedy ventriloquist on.
[44:59.020 --> 45:01.020]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alice Jones.
[45:01.020 --> 45:02.020]  No English window.
[45:02.020 --> 45:03.020]  No, you're not Russian.
[45:03.020 --> 45:08.860]  We've got Ian Varela here with his character, Old Man Gramps, who's got a lot of complaints
[45:08.860 --> 45:13.020]  about government intervention with his farming practices, apparently the EPA.
[45:13.020 --> 45:15.020]  And what about the USDA?
[45:15.020 --> 45:18.020]  You know, they approve genetically modified sugar beets.
[45:18.020 --> 45:19.020]  Yeah.
[45:19.020 --> 45:22.020]  What is up with that sugar deets of all things?
[45:22.020 --> 45:26.020]  Well, I guess, you know, they wanted to grow more, more sugar with Roundup pesticide in
[45:26.020 --> 45:27.020]  it.
[45:27.020 --> 45:28.020]  Nothing.
[45:28.020 --> 45:29.020]  I don't think don't synthesize.
[45:29.020 --> 45:31.020]  Well, no, it doesn't.
[45:31.020 --> 45:34.020]  But I mean, since when did GMOs make any sense?
[45:34.020 --> 45:35.020]  This is true.
[45:35.020 --> 45:36.020]  This is very true.
[45:36.020 --> 45:37.020]  Yeah.
[45:37.020 --> 45:38.020]  Yeah.
[45:38.020 --> 45:42.020]  I, uh, I'm the simple farmer.
[45:42.020 --> 45:43.020]  You're a farmer.
[45:43.020 --> 45:44.020]  You're a simple farmer.
[45:44.020 --> 45:45.020]  Yes.
[45:45.020 --> 45:46.020]  Sure.
[45:46.020 --> 45:49.020]  Just last year, I planted cabbage and razor blades.
[45:49.020 --> 45:51.020]  Why'd you plant razor blades?
[45:51.020 --> 45:52.020]  Coleslaw.
[45:52.020 --> 45:53.020]  Oh my.
[45:53.020 --> 45:54.020]  Oh my.
[45:54.020 --> 45:55.020]  Okay.
[45:55.020 --> 45:56.020]  Shoot it.
[45:56.020 --> 46:01.020]  Guys, you got any questions I need to ask Old Man Gramps here?
[46:01.020 --> 46:02.020]  We've got it.
[46:02.020 --> 46:04.020]  We've got to feed them some good questions.
[46:04.020 --> 46:05.020]  Yeah.
[46:05.020 --> 46:06.020]  Gorka in here.
[46:06.020 --> 46:07.020]  Something's wrong.
[46:07.020 --> 46:08.020]  Oh my.
[46:08.020 --> 46:09.020]  Okay.
[46:09.020 --> 46:11.020]  What's your prediction for who's going to win the presidential election?
[46:11.020 --> 46:12.020]  Okay.
[46:12.020 --> 46:13.020]  Which one?
[46:13.020 --> 46:14.020]  Doesn't matter.
[46:14.020 --> 46:19.020]  And what about, what about firearms?
[46:19.020 --> 46:22.020]  You know, firearms are being taken away all across the country now.
[46:22.020 --> 46:24.020]  You have, you have a shotgun or something?
[46:24.020 --> 46:27.020]  I got me a shotgun there.
[46:27.020 --> 46:34.020]  And I, uh, I bought it when the daughter turned 16 and started dating.
[46:34.020 --> 46:35.020]  Yeah.
[46:35.020 --> 46:41.020]  Yeah, that way I can have something to clean when the boyfriend comes over.
[46:41.020 --> 46:42.020]  Yeah.
[46:42.020 --> 46:43.020]  All right.
[46:43.020 --> 46:46.020]  And what else are you into?
[46:46.020 --> 46:48.020]  You into Ron Paul, you into Liberty.
[46:48.020 --> 46:50.020]  Ron Paul and into rap music.
[46:50.020 --> 46:51.020]  Rap music.
[46:51.020 --> 46:52.020]  You're, you really?
[46:52.020 --> 46:53.020]  Sure.
[46:53.020 --> 46:54.020]  Get out.
[46:54.020 --> 46:55.020]  Oh sure.
[46:55.020 --> 46:56.020]  I like that.
[46:56.020 --> 46:57.020]  In and in.
[46:57.020 --> 46:58.020]  Eminem.
[46:58.020 --> 46:59.020]  Yeah.
[46:59.020 --> 47:00.020]  I like him.
[47:00.020 --> 47:01.020]  What do you, what do you like?
[47:01.020 --> 47:02.020]  What song you like?
[47:02.020 --> 47:07.020]  I like that one that goes, uh, you know, my name is what my name is.
[47:07.020 --> 47:08.020]  What?
[47:08.020 --> 47:10.020]  That's good.
[47:10.020 --> 47:11.020]  Yeah.
[47:11.020 --> 47:12.020]  Yeah.
[47:12.020 --> 47:13.020]  He's, he's.
[47:13.020 --> 47:14.020]  I do.
[47:14.020 --> 47:15.020]  I'm getting his cold.
[47:15.020 --> 47:17.020]  You're getting his cold.
[47:17.020 --> 47:19.020]  We're all getting your cold.
[47:19.020 --> 47:22.020]  It's, uh, I do country and ramp country and rap.
[47:22.020 --> 47:23.020]  What's it called?
[47:23.020 --> 47:24.020]  Crap.
[47:24.020 --> 47:25.020]  Okay.
[47:25.020 --> 47:26.020]  All right.
[47:26.020 --> 47:28.020]  I apologize to the viewers again.
[47:28.020 --> 47:32.020]  Come on.
[47:32.020 --> 47:35.020]  He's sort of wedged his way into the studio today and started ranting.
[47:35.020 --> 47:37.020]  He's actually, you're sitting right on Alex's desk.
[47:37.020 --> 47:38.020]  What's, what's with your socks?
[47:38.020 --> 47:39.020]  No less.
[47:39.020 --> 47:40.020]  What's the deal with that?
[47:40.020 --> 47:41.020]  She's getting comfy.
[47:41.020 --> 47:44.020]  You must have all kinds of farm critters right there.
[47:44.020 --> 47:47.020]  Oh, I tell you what, I tell you what we got.
[47:47.020 --> 47:56.020]  We got horses and chickens and bulls and you do not want to try and milk that bull.
[47:56.020 --> 47:58.020]  You don't want to know.
[47:58.020 --> 47:59.020]  Oh my gosh.
[47:59.020 --> 48:00.020]  Okay.
[48:00.020 --> 48:04.020]  I can just tell someone's going to be calling screaming at me here in just a minute.
[48:04.020 --> 48:05.020]  Oh man.
[48:05.020 --> 48:07.020]  Gramps, what's in your future?
[48:07.020 --> 48:09.020]  We've only got a couple minutes left.
[48:09.020 --> 48:13.020]  What do you want to send for the future here for farming in America?
[48:13.020 --> 48:16.020]  Have you lived in Centerville or San Antonio all your life?
[48:16.020 --> 48:17.020]  Not yet.
[48:17.020 --> 48:20.020]  You live in San Antonio?
[48:20.020 --> 48:21.020]  Oh, sure.
[48:21.020 --> 48:23.020]  I live there in San Antonio.
[48:23.020 --> 48:26.020]  It's kind of, kind of dry, kind of drought conditions there right now.
[48:26.020 --> 48:28.020]  I'm telling you, oh, it's horrible.
[48:28.020 --> 48:29.020]  It's just horrible.
[48:29.020 --> 48:30.020]  Yes, yes, yes.
[48:30.020 --> 48:32.020]  And I'm getting audited too.
[48:32.020 --> 48:33.020]  I'm angry.
[48:33.020 --> 48:34.020]  Angry Irish.
[48:34.020 --> 48:39.020]  Did something put up a red flag?
[48:39.020 --> 48:40.020]  Yeah.
[48:40.020 --> 48:41.020]  What put up a red flag?
[48:41.020 --> 48:45.020]  I had money in my bank account.
[48:45.020 --> 48:47.020]  Oh my, oh my.
[48:47.020 --> 48:48.020]  All right.
[48:48.020 --> 48:49.020]  Ian.
[48:49.020 --> 48:50.020]  Ian.
[48:50.020 --> 48:51.020]  You're last name, Varela?
[48:51.020 --> 48:52.020]  Varela.
[48:52.020 --> 48:53.020]  Varela.
[48:53.020 --> 48:54.020]  Okay.
[48:54.020 --> 48:55.020]  Ian, Ian Varela.
[48:55.020 --> 48:57.020]  The website is comedyvent.com.

[49:00.020 --> 49:01.020]  Thanks.
[49:01.020 --> 49:02.020]  Subtle, Gramps.
[49:02.020 --> 49:03.020]  Very subtle.
[49:03.020 --> 49:04.020]  Yeah.
[49:04.020 --> 49:05.020]  Where is that on eBay?
[49:05.020 --> 49:06.020]  On eBay.
[49:06.020 --> 49:09.020]  Just type in my name, Ian Varela or comedyvent.

[49:18.020 --> 49:20.020]  You have like a devil and an angel character.
[49:20.020 --> 49:21.020]  Yes, we do.
[49:21.020 --> 49:22.020]  Did they talk to you too?
[49:22.020 --> 49:25.020]  They're always, they're always fighting.
[49:25.020 --> 49:28.020]  And what else, what other characters do you have?
[49:28.020 --> 49:29.020]  Alfred.
[49:29.020 --> 49:30.020]  Gramps.
[49:30.020 --> 49:36.020]  We've got the Sanjo the Parrot and the drawing board.
[49:36.020 --> 49:38.020]  Oh, that's a cool thing.
[49:38.020 --> 49:44.020]  Yeah, it's a board where we draw a face onto the board and it starts to move by itself.
[49:44.020 --> 49:45.020]  Well, last question for you.
[49:45.020 --> 49:48.020]  What do you think about free speech in America today?
[49:48.020 --> 49:50.020]  Here you are practicing free speech.
[49:50.020 --> 49:53.020]  We practice free speech right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[49:53.020 --> 49:57.020]  Are you a big defender of the Bill of Rights and free speech particularly?
[49:57.020 --> 50:00.020]  I'm a big defender of that and gun laws.
[50:00.020 --> 50:05.020]  I fight for my right to hunt in the city of San Antonio.
[50:05.020 --> 50:06.020]  In the city.
[50:06.020 --> 50:07.020]  The city.
[50:07.020 --> 50:11.020]  What are you hunting for in the city?
[50:11.020 --> 50:12.020]  Liberals.
[50:12.020 --> 50:13.020]  Liberals.
[50:13.020 --> 50:14.020]  No, no, no.
[50:14.020 --> 50:15.020]  Austin.
[50:15.020 --> 50:16.020]  Austin.
[50:16.020 --> 50:17.020]  Austin.
[50:17.020 --> 50:18.020]  Austin.
[50:18.020 --> 50:19.020]  Austin.
[50:19.020 --> 50:22.020]  No, you can't say that on national radio.
[50:22.020 --> 50:23.020]  You can't.
[50:23.020 --> 50:25.020]  You have to be politically correct.
[50:25.020 --> 50:28.020]  That's taking the fifth.
[50:28.020 --> 50:31.020]  Yeah, the first amendment.
[50:31.020 --> 50:32.020]  All right.
[50:32.020 --> 50:33.020]  All right.
[50:33.020 --> 50:34.020]  We're confused.
[50:34.020 --> 50:36.020]  We're going out now.
[50:36.020 --> 50:39.020]  I hope you enjoyed that segment with the Enverella and Old Man Gramps.
[50:39.020 --> 50:41.020]  Just a little bit of comic relief for you on this Monday.
[50:41.020 --> 50:46.020]  We'll come back with a lot more breaking news and guest Jonathan Emoret at the top of the
[50:46.020 --> 50:47.020]  hour.
[50:47.020 --> 50:48.020]  Stay with us.

[50:52.020 --> 50:53.020]  Today, stay with us.
[50:53.020 --> 50:55.020]  We'll be right back after this break.
[50:55.020 --> 51:06.020]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[51:06.020 --> 51:07.020]  filtration.

[52:29.020 --> 52:33.020]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[52:33.020 --> 52:36.020]  The globalist are scared, they've overreached.
[52:36.020 --> 52:39.020]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[52:39.020 --> 52:46.020]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv, download the thousands of special video reports, e-books and more
[52:46.020 --> 52:48.020]  and get them out to everyone you know.
[52:48.020 --> 52:53.020]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and every other
[52:53.020 --> 52:55.020]  globalist propaganda platform.
[52:55.020 --> 52:58.020]  We are going to use their system against them.
[52:58.020 --> 53:01.020]  The info war now goes into high gear.
[53:01.020 --> 53:03.020]  Hey there, you've reached Claire.
[53:03.020 --> 53:04.020]  Leave me a message.
[53:04.020 --> 53:05.020]  Claire, it's Anne.
[53:05.020 --> 53:08.020]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[53:08.020 --> 53:09.020]  The all natural one.
[53:09.020 --> 53:10.020]  Ambron?
[53:10.020 --> 53:11.020]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[53:11.020 --> 53:16.020]  Not only did Ambron stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambron program, I
[53:16.020 --> 53:18.020]  have lost so much weight.
[53:18.020 --> 53:21.020]  Seriously, even my belly fat, it's gone.
[53:21.020 --> 53:23.020]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[53:23.020 --> 53:24.020]  I feel great.
[53:24.020 --> 53:28.020]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[53:28.020 --> 53:32.020]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[53:32.020 --> 53:36.020]  Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[53:36.020 --> 53:38.020]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[53:38.020 --> 53:41.020]  Plus, Ambron eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[53:41.020 --> 53:46.020]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.
[53:46.020 --> 53:50.020]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now and they'll send you a complimentary risk-free
[53:50.020 --> 53:55.020]  mail with a 30-day supply free call 1-800-839-2959.

[53:58.020 --> 54:21.020]  All right, we're back on The Alice Jones Show.
[54:21.020 --> 54:22.020]  Welcome to just joining us.
[54:22.020 --> 54:23.020]  Thanks for joining us on this Monday.
[54:23.020 --> 54:30.020]  We've got breaking news about an attorney who's being attacked for her position on vaccine
[54:30.020 --> 54:32.020]  rights for parents.
[54:32.020 --> 54:33.020]  This is a big breaking news.
[54:33.020 --> 54:37.020]  We've got an exclusive audio bit coming up.
[54:37.020 --> 54:46.020]  Her name is Patty Finn and she was served with papers to suspend her license to practice
[54:46.020 --> 54:47.020]  law.
[54:47.020 --> 54:54.020]  Chargers have been filed against her because of her address to the parental rights rally
[54:54.020 --> 54:56.020]  in West Virginia.
[54:56.020 --> 55:03.020]  She is also being ordered to disclose the names of the people she represents who do not vaccinate.
[55:03.020 --> 55:06.020]  Now, I hope you realize the enormity of this announcement.
[55:06.020 --> 55:12.020]  All right, this is an attorney, a licensed attorney in West Virginia who is helping parents
[55:12.020 --> 55:17.020]  protect their rights to not vaccinate their children from these vaccines that admittedly cause
[55:17.020 --> 55:22.020]  seizures and cause comas sometimes can even cause death in many cases.
[55:22.020 --> 55:25.020]  And Patty is helping them protect their rights.
[55:25.020 --> 55:30.020]  She is now being absolutely, or I'm sorry, Patricia Finn is her name, or Patty, she's
[55:30.020 --> 55:33.020]  being absolutely attacked by the establishment.
[55:33.020 --> 55:35.020]  They're trying to take away her license.
[55:35.020 --> 55:39.020]  They're trying to force her to disclose the names of her clients.
[55:39.020 --> 55:41.020]  What about attorney-client privilege?
[55:41.020 --> 55:45.020]  And what about the rule of law in this country?
[55:45.020 --> 55:48.020]  She says she refuses to disclose the names of her clients.
[55:48.020 --> 55:51.020]  She says she'll go to jail first before giving out the names.
[55:51.020 --> 55:57.020]  And we have an audio clip, an interview that was just conducted today between Robert Scott
[55:57.020 --> 56:01.020]  Bell and Patricia Finn.
[56:01.020 --> 56:03.020]  Go ahead and roll that audio, please.
[56:03.020 --> 56:06.020]  I'm being monitored on the internet.
[56:06.020 --> 56:13.020]  My address on Wednesday before the We The Parents rally in West Virginia was very well
[56:13.020 --> 56:15.020]  advertised on the internet.
[56:15.020 --> 56:21.020]  And sure enough, when I was leaving to go there, I got served with a complaint saying that I lied
[56:21.020 --> 56:27.020]  about the number of people I represent, the nature of my work, and they want the names
[56:27.020 --> 56:32.020]  and addresses and the details of the parents who do not vaccinate.
[56:32.020 --> 56:36.020]  And I will tell you that they have taken everything from me.
[56:36.020 --> 56:38.020]  I can barely make a living.
[56:38.020 --> 56:40.020]  I can't pay my mortgage.
[56:40.020 --> 56:44.020]  I have lawyers who work for me that haven't been paid for weeks.
[56:44.020 --> 56:49.020]  They're absolutely torturing me, and my license is coveted.
[56:49.020 --> 56:52.020]  It means a lot to me, and I don't want to lose it.
[56:52.020 --> 56:56.020]  But 70% of lawyers are out of work in New York state.
[56:56.020 --> 56:57.020]  They could take my license.
[56:57.020 --> 57:01.020]  I'll hire an attorney for $10 an hour to do what I'm doing.
[57:01.020 --> 57:05.020]  And I hate to sound so glib, but I'm done.
[57:05.020 --> 57:06.020]  Gloves are off.
[57:06.020 --> 57:07.020]  You know, bring it on.
[57:07.020 --> 57:15.020]  They came to my house to serve me with papers because I filed a lawsuit to protect my rights,
[57:15.020 --> 57:17.020]  to stop them from doing this to me.
[57:17.020 --> 57:20.020]  And while I was in West Virginia, they were in my office.
[57:20.020 --> 57:22.020]  They were talking to my neighbors.
[57:22.020 --> 57:26.020]  They were talking to my tenants, talking to my children.
[57:26.020 --> 57:31.020]  When I got home, my son gave me a business card from the night judicial district investigator
[57:31.020 --> 57:32.020]  looking for me.
[57:32.020 --> 57:33.020]  Why?
[57:33.020 --> 57:35.020]  Because I filed a lawsuit years ago.
[57:35.020 --> 57:38.020]  I would have been afraid, and, you know, I'm not.
[57:38.020 --> 57:40.020]  And for that, I'm truly grateful.
[57:40.020 --> 57:41.020]  I'm not afraid.
[57:41.020 --> 57:47.020]  That's Patricia Fenn, the attorney in West Virginia who is now being just completely
[57:47.020 --> 57:53.020]  attacked for her position on defending the rights of parents to protect their children from vaccination.
[57:53.020 --> 58:00.020]  This harassment is being called the Wakefield Effect, obviously referring to Dr. Andrew Wakefield,
[58:00.020 --> 58:03.020]  whose career was completely destroyed.
[58:03.020 --> 58:09.020]  His medical license was stripped from him because he dared to question the false fabricated
[58:09.020 --> 58:15.020]  science of the status quo in relation to how vaccines alter the health of children.
[58:15.020 --> 58:19.020]  Now, we've got much more news coming up here.
[58:19.020 --> 58:24.020]  Also tonight on InfoWars Nightly News, an interview with Patty Finn, so be sure to check that out
[58:24.020 --> 58:26.020]  on InfoWars Nightly News.
[58:26.020 --> 58:31.020]  A lot more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones show, including an interview with Jonathan E. Mord,
[58:31.020 --> 58:33.020]  author and health freedom advocate.
[58:33.020 --> 58:36.020]  Check all that straight ahead as you stay with us.
[58:36.020 --> 58:38.020]  We'll be right back after this break with much more.
[58:38.020 --> 58:39.020]  Stay with us.
[58:39.020 --> 58:48.020]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:09.020 --> 59:16.020]  We'll be right back.
[59:39.020 --> 59:48.020]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five-star-soap.com.
[1:00:10.020 --> 1:00:12.020]  You want answers?
[1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:14.020]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:18.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:18.020 --> 1:00:25.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.020 --> 1:00:26.020]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:00:26.020 --> 1:00:28.020]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:33.020]  I'm Mike Adams, the Health Ranger filling in for Alex today, who is on the road.
[1:00:33.020 --> 1:00:36.020]  We are into our second hour.
[1:00:36.020 --> 1:00:39.020]  We're just breaking some major news here right now.
[1:00:39.020 --> 1:00:45.020]  National news being broken right here on InfoWars about attorney Patricia Finn.
[1:00:45.020 --> 1:00:53.020]  She's a West Virginia attorney who is now being attacked for helping to defend the rights of parents against vaccines.
[1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:58.020]  They're trying to strip away her medical license, or I'm sorry, her license to practice law.
[1:00:58.020 --> 1:01:04.020]  And they're trying to force her to disclose the names of her clients who also refuse to vaccinate.
[1:01:04.020 --> 1:01:07.020]  This is all oppression. This is completely unlawful.
[1:01:07.020 --> 1:01:13.020]  This is yet another example of the way the state is practicing what I call gunpoint medicine,
[1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:20.020]  where they will actually bring guns and rifles and stick them in your face and force you to do what they say you should do for your children.
[1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:29.020]  And if you refuse to do that, then they will, of course, call the Communist Pedophile Services, CPS, to come take your children away at gunpoint,
[1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:35.020]  and they will force your children to undergo chemotherapy at gunpoint, or vaccination at gunpoint.
[1:01:35.020 --> 1:01:37.020]  And I do mean that literally at gunpoint.
[1:01:37.020 --> 1:01:40.020]  For example, in what was it, Maryland, just a couple of years ago,
[1:01:40.020 --> 1:01:49.020]  they had attack dogs outside the courthouse where they had a long line of parents lined up there with police and a militant looking enforcers everywhere
[1:01:49.020 --> 1:01:52.020]  to force them to vaccinate their children.
[1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:54.020]  They're going after everybody. Why?
[1:01:54.020 --> 1:01:57.020]  Because, of course, vaccines are part of the depopulation agenda.
[1:01:57.020 --> 1:02:02.020]  It's all part of eugenics, and they know that the more people they can vaccinate,
[1:02:02.020 --> 1:02:05.020]  the more infertility they're going to cause, the more children they're going to kill,
[1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:08.020]  and the more future medical business they can generate from that,
[1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:10.020]  because vaccines do cause kidney failure.
[1:02:10.020 --> 1:02:12.020]  They do cause liver damage.
[1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:14.020]  They do cause neurological damage.
[1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:16.020]  They cause autism.
[1:02:16.020 --> 1:02:19.020]  They may not be the only cause of autism, but they're certainly correlated with autism,
[1:02:19.020 --> 1:02:23.020]  and the evidence just keeps coming out showing that vaccines are increasingly dangerous.
[1:02:23.020 --> 1:02:30.020]  Now, we've got other news. WikiLeaks has published Security Think Tank emails.
[1:02:30.020 --> 1:02:35.020]  This is from the anonymous hacker group that broke into Strat4.
[1:02:35.020 --> 1:02:38.020]  Strat4 is the intelligence organization based right here in Austin,
[1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:42.020]  and it turns out that gathers intelligence from all around the world
[1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:47.020]  and has a bunch of subscribers who try to get inside intel from them.
[1:02:47.020 --> 1:02:52.020]  And some of what has been published is very damaging to Strat4,
[1:02:52.020 --> 1:02:57.020]  including what just came out today is the Strat4 glossary of terms.
[1:02:57.020 --> 1:03:04.020]  Now, I've posted this on naturalnews so that you can download this PDF right now if you'd like.
[1:03:04.020 --> 1:03:13.020]  Go to naturalnews.com slash files slash Strat4glossary.pdf,
[1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:18.020]  and Strat4 is S-T-R-A-T-F-O-R. Strat4glossary.pdf.
[1:03:18.020 --> 1:03:20.020]  Here's what you find in the glossary.
[1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:26.020]  The Strat4 describes, in this glossary, they're describing different agencies
[1:03:26.020 --> 1:03:28.020]  and different terms. They're defining terminology.
[1:03:28.020 --> 1:03:32.020]  They describe the ATF, for example, as, quote, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms,
[1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:37.020]  rednecks with a license to kill, never, ever ask for their help on anything.
[1:03:37.020 --> 1:03:40.020]  This is right out of the Strat4 glossary.
[1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:47.020]  Moving on, duplicitous little bastards is a term they define as, quote, Israeli intelligence.
[1:03:47.020 --> 1:03:52.020]  They also define the FBI as the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
[1:03:52.020 --> 1:03:57.020]  also known as the Downtown Gang, very good at breaking up used car rings,
[1:03:57.020 --> 1:04:03.020]  kind of confused on anything more complicated, fun to jerk with, not fun when they jerk back.
[1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:07.020]  Again, this is the Strat4 glossary that has been leaked by WikiLeaks.
[1:04:07.020 --> 1:04:12.020]  This is the kind of documentation that many of the Intel insiders get their hands on.
[1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:19.020]  They define intelligence officer as, quote, an individual charged with overseeing all aspects of an intelligence operation.
[1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:23.020]  Senior intelligence officers can manage multiple operations.
[1:04:23.020 --> 1:04:28.020]  Chief intelligence officers manage thousands of operations, all leading to disaster.
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:30.020]  Those are their own words.
[1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:36.020]  JTTF, Joint Terrorism Task Force, an interagency group created to completely confuse
[1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:42.020]  all conceivable issues related to terrorism in a variety of metropolitan areas.
[1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:46.020]  We've got more terms coming up from that leaked glossary.
[1:04:46.020 --> 1:04:48.020]  Plus, an interview with Jonathan Emord.
[1:04:48.020 --> 1:04:50.020]  Straight ahead, stay with us here on the Alice Jones Show.
[1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:53.020]  We'll be right back with a lot more. Stay with us.
[1:05:01.020 --> 1:05:05.020]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[1:05:05.020 --> 1:05:08.020]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving.
[1:05:08.020 --> 1:05:14.020]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:21.020]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:26.020]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[1:05:26.020 --> 1:05:32.020]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[1:05:32.020 --> 1:05:36.020]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need,
[1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:40.020]  and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:46.020]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[1:05:46.020 --> 1:05:48.020]  Check it out for yourself. It's incredible.

[1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:05.020]  Folks, Iran and the Middle East nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[1:06:05.020 --> 1:06:10.020]  Whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas costs now,

[1:06:13.020 --> 1:06:18.020]  whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.

[1:06:54.020 --> 1:07:00.020]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:05.020]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:07:05.020 --> 1:07:09.020]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:07:09.020 --> 1:07:15.020]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:07:15.020 --> 1:07:20.020]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:07:20.020 --> 1:07:25.020]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:29.020]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:32.020]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:36.020]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:07:36.020 --> 1:07:41.020]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:46.020]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:50.020]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:07:50.020 --> 1:07:52.020]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:07:52.020 --> 1:08:16.020]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:08:16.020 --> 1:08:24.020]  We're just talking about some of the terminology in the Stratforglossary that has been leaked by WikiLeaks.
[1:08:24.020 --> 1:08:34.020]  This was some of the material that was, shall we say, lifted from Stratfor by Anonymous, the hacker group.
[1:08:34.020 --> 1:08:36.020]  And I'm just going to continue with a couple points there.
[1:08:36.020 --> 1:08:40.020]  And then we're going to be joined by Jonathan Emord with his new book called Restoring the Republic,
[1:08:40.020 --> 1:08:44.020]  a very important book with a foreword written by Ron Paul.
[1:08:44.020 --> 1:08:46.020]  Let me get to him in just a second, but let me just finish this up.
[1:08:46.020 --> 1:08:50.020]  I'm sure Jonathan Emord, who's listening on the phone, will have a good laugh at this.
[1:08:50.020 --> 1:09:00.020]  The glossary from Stratfor says a PowerPoint presentation is an efficient means for turning complex and sophisticated analysis into half-witted bullets.
[1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:05.020]  If you can't read a 50-page analysis before invading a country, you probably shouldn't be in the business.
[1:09:05.020 --> 1:09:13.020]  And then they have a term, a PowerPoint ranger, is a member of an intelligence team whose primary contribution is making PowerPoint presentations.
[1:09:13.020 --> 1:09:17.020]  Usually assigned to the least competent member of the team to keep him out of trouble,
[1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:24.020]  who winds up controlling the operation because management keeps promoting him because he makes neat animations.
[1:09:24.020 --> 1:09:32.020]  And then one last one, they define the Secret Service as a group that, quote, catches counterfeiters,
[1:09:32.020 --> 1:09:35.020]  breaks up child pornography rings and guards the president.
[1:09:35.020 --> 1:09:38.020]  Continual identity crisis, they say.
[1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:39.020]  Very nice people.
[1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:42.020]  Not, shall we say, the most sophisticated crew you'll ever find.
[1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:46.020]  Again, these are the words of Stratfor and their glossary, which has been leaked.
[1:09:46.020 --> 1:09:50.020]  A lot more leaked emails coming out, no doubt, in the next few days from WikiLeaks,
[1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:56.020]  who continues to pummel the global elite with all kinds of liberated information.
[1:09:56.020 --> 1:10:01.020]  Now, before we go to Jonathan Emord, I want to encourage you to take advantage of the Alice Jones Everything Special.
[1:10:01.020 --> 1:10:03.020]  It's only two more days.
[1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:05.020]  If you haven't taken advantage of this, do it now.
[1:10:05.020 --> 1:10:11.020]  For the next two days, you can get over $379 worth of all the films, all the DVDs.
[1:10:11.020 --> 1:10:18.020]  Everything that Alex Jones has produced in film format for just 1995.
[1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:21.020]  Plus, you'll get Invisible Empire.
[1:10:21.020 --> 1:10:27.020]  Plus, Police State Four, The Rise of FEMA, Fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack Obama,
[1:10:27.020 --> 1:10:32.020]  the Obama deception, the 9-11 Chronicles Part 1, and much more.
[1:10:32.020 --> 1:10:35.020]  I actually bought this right around Christmas.
[1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:40.020]  I came in here and bought that myself because I wanted to have that on DVD as well.
[1:10:40.020 --> 1:10:43.020]  Remember, they can take any of this off the Internet at any time.
[1:10:43.020 --> 1:10:47.020]  So if you want to have the DVDs, get your hands on this special again.
[1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:49.020]  Two days only. That's what's remaining.
[1:10:49.020 --> 1:10:53.020]  Go to infowars.com to get this special.
[1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:58.020]  Is there a special URL beyond that, or is it just infowars.com?
[1:10:58.020 --> 1:11:00.020]  infowars.com.
[1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:01.020]  It's in the store.
[1:11:01.020 --> 1:11:04.020]  Click on the store once you get there, infowars.com.
[1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:11.020]  All right, now we're joined by Jonathan Emord, who is really, I believe, one of the most important voices in our republic.
[1:11:11.020 --> 1:11:14.020]  He has defeated the FDA in court.
[1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:21.020]  He has written numerous books, some of which are on my top list of most important books in the health freedom movement,
[1:11:21.020 --> 1:11:23.020]  such as the Global Censorship of Health Information.
[1:11:23.020 --> 1:11:30.020]  He's also written a book called The Rise of Tyranny, which talks about how agencies, government agencies like the FDA, DHS, and so on,
[1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:34.020]  get out of control and create their own fiefdoms of power and tyranny.
[1:11:34.020 --> 1:11:40.020]  He has a new book coming out now that's called Restore the Republic, and he joins us by phone.
[1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:42.020]  Jonathan, are you there?
[1:11:42.020 --> 1:11:44.020]  Mike, I'm here. Good to be with you.
[1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:47.020]  Oh, you're with us on Skype video. Okay, great to see you there.
[1:11:47.020 --> 1:11:50.020]  All right. Well, Jonathan, it's great to have you on.
[1:11:50.020 --> 1:11:52.020]  I'm honored to have you as a guest today.
[1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:56.020]  Thank you for your contributions, and I'm really excited about your new book.
[1:11:56.020 --> 1:11:59.020]  Well, thank you very much, and I'm excited about it as well.
[1:11:59.020 --> 1:12:02.020]  I was just curious about it. Do I get the title right because it's brand new?
[1:12:02.020 --> 1:12:03.020]  Is it Restore the Republic?
[1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:05.020]  Restore the Republic.
[1:12:05.020 --> 1:12:08.020]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:12:08.020 --> 1:12:12.020]  Give us an overview of what's covered there.
[1:12:12.020 --> 1:12:14.020]  Did we lose Jonathan there?
[1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:15.020]  Okay.
[1:12:15.020 --> 1:12:18.020]  It's available through a secure link on emord.com,
[1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:22.020]  and can turn the destruction of all of our rights based...
[1:12:22.020 --> 1:12:23.020]  Am I here?
[1:12:23.020 --> 1:12:28.020]  Yeah, we restored the Republic, unfortunately, for the nation.
[1:12:28.020 --> 1:12:33.020]  The entire rights basis of this country,
[1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:37.020]  all of the power-limiting doctrines that are imposed on the federal government
[1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:40.020]  by the founding fathers have been stripped from the Constitution
[1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:43.020]  for the past 75 years.
[1:12:43.020 --> 1:12:47.020]  Beginning primarily during Roosevelt administration in the 1930s,
[1:12:47.020 --> 1:12:53.020]  the government has consistently violated the constitutional limitations on power,
[1:12:53.020 --> 1:13:01.020]  so much so that it has transformed the United States from a limited federal republic
[1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:05.020]  into an unlimited bureaucratic oligarchy.
[1:13:05.020 --> 1:13:09.020]  Nine-tenths of all federal laws are now the product of those who are not elected,
[1:13:09.020 --> 1:13:12.020]  who run the independent regulatory commissions.
[1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:17.020]  The effect of this is profound in reducing protection for individual liberty
[1:13:17.020 --> 1:13:21.020]  and enabling the government to replace individuals as sovereign.
[1:13:21.020 --> 1:13:27.020]  Let's talk about some specific examples of that, Jonathan.
[1:13:27.020 --> 1:13:28.020]  Could you go into those?
[1:13:28.020 --> 1:13:34.020]  For example, the ATF telling gun shops that they have to report more than one sale
[1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:37.020]  of a rifle to somebody on the same day.
[1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:39.020]  Congress never passed that law.
[1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:41.020]  The ATF simply invented that.
[1:13:41.020 --> 1:13:42.020]  The FDA invents things.
[1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:46.020]  Can you give other examples of these oligarchies just inventing their own rules?
[1:13:46.020 --> 1:13:51.020]  Well, there are no procedural checks whatsoever in any of the federal agencies
[1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:58.020]  to cause agency officials to second-guess their actions based on restrictions in the Constitution.
[1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:03.020]  So, for example, the government will give itself the authority to engage in these inspections
[1:14:03.020 --> 1:14:05.020]  through the ATF, for example.
[1:14:05.020 --> 1:14:12.020]  But the ATF agents and the ATF itself have no procedural checks
[1:14:12.020 --> 1:14:17.020]  to prevent them from infringing upon individuals' rights.
[1:14:17.020 --> 1:14:19.020]  They just don't exist in the government.
[1:14:19.020 --> 1:14:22.020]  And the reason for it, even though they exist in the Constitution,
[1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:25.020]  is that the government is a renegade.
[1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:27.020]  It has left the Constitution.
[1:14:27.020 --> 1:14:30.020]  There's a dissonance between what the Constitution requires
[1:14:30.020 --> 1:14:33.020]  and what the government is doing that is so great
[1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:37.020]  that we no longer have a nation of free people
[1:14:37.020 --> 1:14:40.020]  and a nation that protects our individual liberty,
[1:14:40.020 --> 1:14:42.020]  the founding of the Republic.
[1:14:42.020 --> 1:14:46.020]  Of course, that was the central purpose for having a government at all.
[1:14:46.020 --> 1:14:49.020]  It was to protect the rights of man, the unalienable rights of individuals.
[1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:52.020]  And in the book, Restore the Republic,
[1:14:52.020 --> 1:14:56.020]  I not only chronicle this history and precisely how each one of the doctrines
[1:14:56.020 --> 1:15:00.020]  the Founding Fathers identified as essential to limiting power
[1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:02.020]  and ensuring freedom have been destroyed,
[1:15:02.020 --> 1:15:07.020]  but also how we can recreate those doctrines and reimplement them
[1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:10.020]  and specifically what reductions in government,
[1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:13.020]  specific agencies and departments that should be eliminated
[1:15:13.020 --> 1:15:17.020]  in order for us to save the nation from destruction.
[1:15:17.020 --> 1:15:22.020]  I mean, we are literally within a decade of the destruction of the United States.
[1:15:22.020 --> 1:15:24.020]  Wait a minute. Let me stop you right there.
[1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:26.020]  Those are strong words.
[1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:28.020]  You also use the term renegade government,
[1:15:28.020 --> 1:15:31.020]  but I think people are seeing that, that what you're saying is true.
[1:15:31.020 --> 1:15:35.020]  You just said we're within a decade of maybe losing the Republic we have.
[1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:39.020]  You're seeing that the federal government is increasingly lawless.
[1:15:39.020 --> 1:15:42.020]  It does not even honor the laws of the land,
[1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:45.020]  certainly not the Constitution, certainly not the Bill of Rights.
[1:15:45.020 --> 1:15:47.020]  Can you comment on that and just a tip?
[1:15:47.020 --> 1:15:50.020]  If you look right into the camera, it'll be better for YouTube videos.
[1:15:50.020 --> 1:15:51.020]  Go ahead, Jonathan.
[1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:56.020]  Well, the government violates rights with impunity.
[1:15:56.020 --> 1:15:59.020]  Take, for example, the National Defense Authorization Act
[1:15:59.020 --> 1:16:02.020]  completely suspends the writ of habeas corpus
[1:16:02.020 --> 1:16:06.020]  and the American accused of having support for a terrorist organization,
[1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:08.020]  whether they're rightly accused or wrongly accused.
[1:16:08.020 --> 1:16:10.020]  We don't know until there's a trial,
[1:16:10.020 --> 1:16:13.020]  but we're certainly entitled to a presumption of innocence.
[1:16:13.020 --> 1:16:18.020]  That is all blown away because military forces may go and apprehend you
[1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:20.020]  and put you in jail and do so indefinitely
[1:16:20.020 --> 1:16:23.020]  without ever bringing you before a court of justice,
[1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:26.020]  without ever even informing you of their charges.
[1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:29.020]  And that just came into law through the National Defense Authorization Act.
[1:16:29.020 --> 1:16:33.020]  We have reached a state in this country
[1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:39.020]  where rights are violated with impunity to pursue federal objectives.
[1:16:39.020 --> 1:16:43.020]  I mean, the Obamacare, for example, the insurance mandate,
[1:16:43.020 --> 1:16:47.020]  we're violating individuals' rights to privacy,
[1:16:47.020 --> 1:16:53.020]  to freedom of contract, to freedom of association.
[1:16:53.020 --> 1:16:58.020]  With impunity with Obamacare, everyone must be insured.
[1:16:58.020 --> 1:17:02.020]  You must go out and buy insurance from a private insurer
[1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:06.020]  that is qualified by the federal government come January 1, 2014.
[1:17:06.020 --> 1:17:10.020]  And that's a gross deprivation of your freedom of choice,
[1:17:10.020 --> 1:17:11.020]  your individual liberty.
[1:17:11.020 --> 1:17:15.020]  It's antithetical to the very core values of the Constitution
[1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:18.020]  and to express rights that are protected by the Constitution.
[1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:20.020]  I do want to get to some solutions.
[1:17:20.020 --> 1:17:24.020]  I know your book offers solutions, and I want to ask you about that.
[1:17:24.020 --> 1:17:29.020]  But to support what you're saying about the seriousness of this issue,
[1:17:29.020 --> 1:17:33.020]  I've got a lot of friends, people, contacts in the military.
[1:17:33.020 --> 1:17:39.020]  There is talk in the military that they will refuse orders to confiscate guns.
[1:17:39.020 --> 1:17:44.020]  There's even talk in some quarters of if things continue going down this road
[1:17:44.020 --> 1:17:47.020]  where we're losing the Republic, talk of a military coup
[1:17:47.020 --> 1:17:53.020]  to restore law and order under the Constitution and under the Bill of Rights.
[1:17:53.020 --> 1:17:55.020]  I mean, you don't hear that publicly, obviously,
[1:17:55.020 --> 1:17:59.020]  but just behind closed doors, that talk is very real.
[1:17:59.020 --> 1:18:01.020]  It is happening.
[1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:05.020]  Do you think that's an indication of how far down this road of tyranny
[1:18:05.020 --> 1:18:09.020]  we have already gone and found ourselves?
[1:18:09.020 --> 1:18:13.020]  Well, there's no more fundamental rule of law than the Constitution.
[1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:17.020]  And when you amend the Constitution without following the process
[1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:20.020]  identified in Article VI of the Constitution,
[1:18:20.020 --> 1:18:24.020]  which is to obtain the consent of the American people to an amendment,
[1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:29.020]  when you don't do that, and when you instead just alter the Constitution
[1:18:29.020 --> 1:18:32.020]  by making specific provisions, dead letters,
[1:18:32.020 --> 1:18:36.020]  by reinterpreting provisions to mean the opposite of what they were intended to mean,
[1:18:36.020 --> 1:18:43.020]  when you do those sorts of things, you erode and destroy the legitimacy of the government.
[1:18:43.020 --> 1:18:48.020]  And you invariably invite the very kinds of revolutions
[1:18:48.020 --> 1:18:51.020]  that the Founding Fathers feared would be necessary.
[1:18:51.020 --> 1:18:57.020]  I mean, Thomas Jefferson was the most strident advocate of revolution.
[1:18:57.020 --> 1:19:00.020]  He said that if the United States didn't have a revolution every 20 years,
[1:19:00.020 --> 1:19:04.020]  he would be fearful for the defense of liberty
[1:19:04.020 --> 1:19:08.020]  because he invariably thought that governors would rule corruptly,
[1:19:08.020 --> 1:19:11.020]  that they would pursue their own self-interest at public expense
[1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:13.020]  and would deny people their rights.
[1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:19.020]  And Adams and Alexander Hamilton believed that the electoral process would be sufficient.
[1:19:19.020 --> 1:19:21.020]  Well, now we're very much testing that.
[1:19:21.020 --> 1:19:25.020]  I mean, either the government of the United States will come into...
[1:19:25.020 --> 1:19:27.020]  30 seconds, Jonathan, go ahead.
[1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:30.020]  Either the government of the United States will conform with the Constitution
[1:19:30.020 --> 1:19:36.020]  or it will provoke a reaction from the American people, the likes of which we have not seen.
[1:19:36.020 --> 1:19:39.020]  All right, very important words from Jonathan Emord,
[1:19:39.020 --> 1:19:41.020]  author of the new book Restore the Republic.
[1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:45.020]  We'll be back with more interview with Jonathan Emord on the other side of this break.
[1:19:45.020 --> 1:19:49.020]  Stay with us here on The Alex Jones Show, and thank you for tuning in.
[1:19:49.020 --> 1:19:52.020]  A lot of breaking news today, a lot of important information.
[1:19:52.020 --> 1:19:55.020]  Don't go away. We'll be right back after this break.
[1:20:04.020 --> 1:20:08.020]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:12.020]  that looks like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target.
[1:20:12.020 --> 1:20:15.020]  Make it look like someone is watching television with fake TV.
[1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:20.020]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:23.020]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:27.020]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[1:20:27.020 --> 1:20:30.020]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm,
[1:20:30.020 --> 1:20:33.020]  and is recommended by numerous police departments.
[1:20:33.020 --> 1:20:35.020]  Use it any time you're away from home.
[1:20:35.020 --> 1:20:40.020]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com
[1:20:40.020 --> 1:20:43.020]  or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV.
[1:20:43.020 --> 1:20:48.020]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one
[1:20:48.020 --> 1:20:51.020]  for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.

[1:21:00.020 --> 1:21:06.020]  Folks, Iran and the Middle East nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[1:21:06.020 --> 1:21:11.020]  Whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas costs now,

[1:22:00.020 --> 1:22:04.020]  IRS, the three most dreaded letters of the alphabet.
[1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:08.020]  If you owe back taxes, have unfiled tax returns, are receiving threatening letters,
[1:22:08.020 --> 1:22:11.020]  or have IRS agents coming to your home or place of business,
[1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.020]  you need an experienced IRS agent fighting on your side.
[1:22:14.020 --> 1:22:21.020]  Call the Tax Relief Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:23.020]  Spearheaded by a former IRS agent.
[1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:26.020]  We know how to negotiate a reduction in the tax you owe.
[1:22:26.020 --> 1:22:31.020]  Stop wage garnishments, lift bank levies, and negotiate an affordable repayment plan.
[1:22:31.020 --> 1:22:35.020]  With 17 years as a practicing attorney and an A-plus better business rating,
[1:22:35.020 --> 1:22:38.020]  we'll get the IRS off your back once and for all.
[1:22:38.020 --> 1:22:42.020]  In fact, recently when an IRS employee had a tax problem, she called us.

[1:22:54.020 --> 1:22:57.020]  Again, that's 800-652-6978.
[1:22:57.020 --> 1:23:00.020]  Actual results based on individual client circumstances.
[1:23:00.020 --> 1:23:03.020]  Hey there, you've reached Claire. Leave me a message.
[1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:04.020]  Claire, it's Anne.
[1:23:04.020 --> 1:23:07.020]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[1:23:07.020 --> 1:23:08.020]  The all-natural one.
[1:23:08.020 --> 1:23:10.020]  Ambron? Well, I gotta tell you this.
[1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:13.020]  Not only did Ambron stop my hot flashes,
[1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:17.020]  but since I started the Ambron program, I have lost so much weight.
[1:23:17.020 --> 1:23:20.020]  Seriously, even my belly fat, it's gone.
[1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:22.020]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[1:23:22.020 --> 1:23:24.020]  I feel great. Give me a call.
[1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:27.020]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:31.020]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[1:23:31.020 --> 1:23:35.020]  Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[1:23:35.020 --> 1:23:38.020]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[1:23:38.020 --> 1:23:41.020]  Plus, Ambron eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[1:23:41.020 --> 1:23:45.020]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.
[1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:47.020]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now,
[1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:51.020]  and they'll send you a complimentary risk-free trial with a 30-day supply free.
[1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:54.020]  Call 1-800-839-2959.
[1:23:54.020 --> 1:23:57.020]  That's 1-800-839-2959.
[1:23:57.020 --> 1:24:00.020]  1-800-839-2959.
[1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:13.020]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[1:24:13.020 --> 1:24:18.020]  There's an important article I'd like to bring your attention to on Infowars.com.
[1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:20.020]  We quoted from it earlier about Patty Finn.
[1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:24.020]  This was the attorney who's being basically just completely attacked
[1:24:24.020 --> 1:24:28.020]  for defending the rights of parents to avoid vaccinating the children.
[1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:31.020]  The article is written by Kurt Linderman Sr.
[1:24:31.020 --> 1:24:33.020]  Kurt Linderman was a guest before.
[1:24:33.020 --> 1:24:39.020]  He's a very outspoken father about vaccine rights for parents.
[1:24:39.020 --> 1:24:43.020]  And the article is entitled New York Ninth Judicial Committee Attacks
[1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:45.020]  Vaccine Parental Rights Attorney.
[1:24:45.020 --> 1:24:48.020]  So check out that headline on Infowars.com.
[1:24:48.020 --> 1:24:52.020]  Lots of other news coming up there today from Kurt Nemo, Paul Joseph Watson,
[1:24:52.020 --> 1:24:55.020]  and many of the other outstanding writers.
[1:24:55.020 --> 1:24:58.020]  Also a programming note, I apologize to the listeners.
[1:24:58.020 --> 1:25:01.020]  I misquoted the Everything Special price.
[1:25:01.020 --> 1:25:05.020]  It should be $99.95 as it has always been.
[1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:10.020]  That's the Everything Special, $379 plus worth of videos.
[1:25:10.020 --> 1:25:13.020]  Everything that Alex Jones has produced for $99.95.
[1:25:13.020 --> 1:25:16.020]  I misquoted the price earlier and I apologize for that.
[1:25:16.020 --> 1:25:18.020]  There's actually a lot going on today, as you might imagine.
[1:25:18.020 --> 1:25:21.020]  Now, we're continuing our interview with Jonathan Emoret,
[1:25:21.020 --> 1:25:23.020]  author of Restore the Republic.
[1:25:23.020 --> 1:25:24.020]  And just before the break,
[1:25:24.020 --> 1:25:26.020]  he was talking about the breakdown of the Republic
[1:25:26.020 --> 1:25:29.020]  and how these federal agencies are growing out of control,
[1:25:29.020 --> 1:25:31.020]  becoming lawless, renegade agencies.
[1:25:31.020 --> 1:25:34.020]  Where do you want to pick it up, Jonathan, from there?
[1:25:34.020 --> 1:25:40.020]  Well, both Republicans and Democrats who are economists,
[1:25:40.020 --> 1:25:43.020]  Alice Rivlin, for example, from the Clinton administration,
[1:25:43.020 --> 1:25:48.020]  and Dan Walker, former Comptroller General of the United States,
[1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:51.020]  agree that federal spending at the present levels is unsustainable.
[1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:57.020]  The government simply cannot exist if we are to maintain these spending levels.
[1:25:57.020 --> 1:26:00.020]  We have a $15.5 trillion national debt.
[1:26:00.020 --> 1:26:04.020]  It has to rise to about $23 trillion by 2021.
[1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:09.020]  The interest on the debt alone by 2021 will be over $700 billion a year.
[1:26:09.020 --> 1:26:12.020]  When you look at the present levels of spending,
[1:26:12.020 --> 1:26:16.020]  the national debt exceeds the gross domestic product,
[1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:21.020]  and the trajectory for future spending is to cause that division to even grow wider.
[1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:24.020]  So it's impossible to sustain this government.
[1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:29.020]  And the politics of spending are still very much alive.
[1:26:29.020 --> 1:26:34.020]  Government politicians have absolutely no hesitation, such as this president,
[1:26:34.020 --> 1:26:38.020]  to offer more and more extraordinarily expensive spending programs,
[1:26:38.020 --> 1:26:42.020]  and no serious effort whatsoever to reduce the cost of the government
[1:26:42.020 --> 1:26:44.020]  or the size and the scope of it.
[1:26:44.020 --> 1:26:49.020]  And everything that is private is invariably becoming either public
[1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:53.020]  or subject to heavy government regulation and control,
[1:26:53.020 --> 1:26:56.020]  stultifying the growth of the marketplace.
[1:26:56.020 --> 1:27:00.020]  So at the same time that the government very much needs more revenue
[1:27:00.020 --> 1:27:05.020]  in order to finance this vast expansion of the government that seems endless,
[1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:08.020]  it is destroying the very source of its revenue.
[1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:14.020]  But Jonathan, here on Infowars, all of us here, Alex, especially,
[1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:16.020]  talks about that that is intentional.
[1:27:16.020 --> 1:27:18.020]  That's the plan to destroy America's economy.
[1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:20.020]  It's a parasite upon the market.
[1:27:20.020 --> 1:27:24.020]  It's a problem with the current rate of growth.
[1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:27.020]  I'm sorry, we had a little blip in the audio there.
[1:27:27.020 --> 1:27:28.020]  We're saying that...
[1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:30.020]  It is to make everything private-public.
[1:27:30.020 --> 1:27:32.020]  Yeah.
[1:27:32.020 --> 1:27:35.020]  Okay. You just said to make everything private-public.
[1:27:35.020 --> 1:27:37.020]  Exactly. Government controlling the economy.
[1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:39.020]  What about the destruction of the economy,
[1:27:39.020 --> 1:27:42.020]  the destruction of the private sector, the destruction of innovation,
[1:27:42.020 --> 1:27:46.020]  the moving, the shifting of jobs forcefully outside the country?
[1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:49.020]  Do you think that's deliberate, or is it just really poor, poor planning
[1:27:49.020 --> 1:27:51.020]  by people in Washington?
[1:27:51.020 --> 1:27:53.020]  No, of course it's deliberate.
[1:27:53.020 --> 1:27:58.020]  These people have spent decades in social engineering,
[1:27:58.020 --> 1:28:00.020]  and in economic planning.
[1:28:00.020 --> 1:28:03.020]  They have spent lifetimes, these bureaucrats,
[1:28:03.020 --> 1:28:07.020]  have spent lifetimes involved in precisely this kind of expansion
[1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:09.020]  of the regulatory state.
[1:28:09.020 --> 1:28:11.020]  None of this would have been possible had economic liberty
[1:28:11.020 --> 1:28:14.020]  been entitled to full constitutional protection,
[1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:17.020]  as it was before the 1930s.
[1:28:17.020 --> 1:28:20.020]  It was in the 1930s that the courts reduced the level
[1:28:20.020 --> 1:28:25.020]  of economic protection for economic liberty to a bare minimum,
[1:28:25.020 --> 1:28:27.020]  ushering in the regulatory state.
[1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:30.020]  So much so that right off the bat, right out of the starting gates,
[1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:34.020]  the National Recovery Act had the President of the United States,
[1:28:34.020 --> 1:28:38.020]  Franklin Roosevelt, setting wages, prices,
[1:28:38.020 --> 1:28:40.020]  putting controls on production,
[1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:44.020]  determining the quantity of units to be produced during the Depression.
[1:28:44.020 --> 1:28:48.020]  And this precedent has been expanded and used over and over again
[1:28:48.020 --> 1:28:50.020]  by Republicans and Democrats alike.
[1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:54.020]  So much so that really it is the rare exception
[1:28:54.020 --> 1:28:57.020]  that individuals in the marketplace make decisions
[1:28:57.020 --> 1:29:01.020]  that are uninfluenced by federal regulation.
[1:29:01.020 --> 1:29:04.020]  Almost every decision a person makes in the marketplace
[1:29:04.020 --> 1:29:08.020]  is in one way or another influenced by the direction
[1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:10.020]  that the government would have them go in.
[1:29:10.020 --> 1:29:13.020]  So is it any surprise to us then that we're suffering
[1:29:13.020 --> 1:29:18.020]  the same kind of economic travis that ultimately brought
[1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:20.020]  communist China to capitalism?
[1:29:20.020 --> 1:29:23.020]  No, but it is shocking that the United States
[1:29:23.020 --> 1:29:25.020]  around the world preaches capitalism.
[1:29:25.020 --> 1:29:28.020]  Sorry to cut you off there, we're about to go to break.
[1:29:28.020 --> 1:29:30.020]  The book is called Restore the Republic.
[1:29:30.020 --> 1:29:35.020]  You can find it at emord.com, that's E-M-O-R-D dot com,
[1:29:35.020 --> 1:29:37.020]  or on Amazon, other places.
[1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:38.020]  Stay with us here.
[1:29:38.020 --> 1:29:40.020]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:42.020]  This is Mike Adams, Health Ranger filling in,
[1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:46.020]  and Jonathan Emord staying with us for another 30 minutes.
[1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.020]  More information about the Republic.
[1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:50.020]  Stay with us.
[1:29:50.020 --> 1:29:52.020]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.020 --> 1:29:54.020]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.020 --> 1:29:58.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:03.020 --> 1:30:04.020]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones,
[1:30:04.020 --> 1:30:07.020]  and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:30:07.020 --> 1:30:10.020]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:30:10.020 --> 1:30:13.020]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[1:30:13.020 --> 1:30:16.020]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[1:30:16.020 --> 1:30:18.020]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[1:30:18.020 --> 1:30:20.020]  for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[1:30:20.020 --> 1:30:24.020]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:30:24.020 --> 1:30:27.020]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:30.020]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[1:30:30.020 --> 1:30:32.020]  instantly into the bloodstream
[1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:34.020]  with continued legislation threatening the sale
[1:30:34.020 --> 1:30:36.020]  of nano-silver products.
[1:30:36.020 --> 1:30:39.020]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:30:39.020 --> 1:30:41.020]  with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:30:41.020 --> 1:30:44.020]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[1:30:44.020 --> 1:30:46.020]  making production fast and simple.
[1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:50.020]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today
[1:30:50.020 --> 1:30:52.020]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[1:30:52.020 --> 1:30:54.020]  of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:30:54.020 --> 1:30:57.020]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:02.020]  I had tried everything.
[1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:04.020]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:06.020]  I was lifting weights and jogging,
[1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:07.020]  but nothing was working.
[1:31:07.020 --> 1:31:09.020]  My body was literally starving
[1:31:09.020 --> 1:31:12.020]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[1:31:12.020 --> 1:31:14.020]  And as soon as I had that,
[1:31:14.020 --> 1:31:17.020]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[1:31:17.020 --> 1:31:19.020]  and be satisfied.
[1:31:19.020 --> 1:31:21.020]  Now, there are hundreds of great products
[1:31:21.020 --> 1:31:22.020]  at infowarstein.com,
[1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:24.020]  but I want to point out the three
[1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:26.020]  that have helped me lose
[1:31:26.020 --> 1:31:30.020]  37 pounds in just two months.
[1:31:30.020 --> 1:31:33.020]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine,
[1:31:33.020 --> 1:31:35.020]  Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[1:31:35.020 --> 1:31:37.020]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine
[1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:38.020]  and other products every day,
[1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:41.020]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[1:31:41.020 --> 1:31:43.020]  Now, that's results.
[1:31:43.020 --> 1:31:45.020]  I want to challenge my listeners
[1:31:45.020 --> 1:31:47.020]  to go to infowarstein.com
[1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:49.020]  and to order just three of their products.
[1:31:49.020 --> 1:31:51.020]  And you will see the changes
[1:31:51.020 --> 1:31:53.020]  in the way you look, feel,
[1:31:53.020 --> 1:31:55.020]  and in your appetite almost immediately.
[1:31:55.020 --> 1:31:58.020]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[1:31:58.020 --> 1:32:05.020]  At infowarstein.com
[1:32:29.020 --> 1:32:30.020]  For you and your family.
[1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:31.020]  And here's the best part.
[1:32:31.020 --> 1:32:34.020]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:36.020]  And you actually get enough seeds
[1:32:36.020 --> 1:32:38.020]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:41.020]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[1:32:41.020 --> 1:32:43.020]  That's survivalseedbank.com
[1:32:43.020 --> 1:32:48.020]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:32:48.020 --> 1:32:52.020]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:54.020]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[1:32:54.020 --> 1:32:57.020]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:32:57.020 --> 1:33:00.020]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:33:16.020 --> 1:33:18.020]  I was in Houston this weekend
[1:33:18.020 --> 1:33:22.020]  and I hadn't been off my ranch for several months.
[1:33:22.020 --> 1:33:24.020]  I mean, not into a major city.
[1:33:24.020 --> 1:33:26.020]  Well, I guess I was in Dallas, what am I thinking?
[1:33:26.020 --> 1:33:28.020]  But I mean, I hadn't really stayed overnight
[1:33:28.020 --> 1:33:29.020]  anyplace off the ranch.
[1:33:29.020 --> 1:33:33.020]  And I couldn't believe how much trouble
[1:33:33.020 --> 1:33:37.020]  Houston is going to be in a collapsed scenario.
[1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:41.020]  Places like LA, places like New York, Chicago.
[1:33:41.020 --> 1:33:44.020]  These cities are in so much trouble
[1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:47.020]  and we as a nation are in so much trouble
[1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:48.020]  if things start to fall apart.
[1:33:48.020 --> 1:33:50.020]  I mean, there's no place to grow food in these cities.
[1:33:50.020 --> 1:33:51.020]  There's no way to get water.
[1:33:51.020 --> 1:33:53.020]  There's no way to be safe.
[1:33:53.020 --> 1:33:56.020]  There's probably not going to be any law or order
[1:33:56.020 --> 1:33:59.020]  in a breakdown, even like a grid down scenario.
[1:33:59.020 --> 1:34:01.020]  But Jonathan Emoret, our guest,
[1:34:01.020 --> 1:34:03.020]  continues with us now to talk about
[1:34:03.020 --> 1:34:06.020]  what looks like what could be the failing of the Republic
[1:34:06.020 --> 1:34:07.020]  if we stay on this current path.
[1:34:07.020 --> 1:34:10.020]  And then how can we stop that from happening?
[1:34:10.020 --> 1:34:12.020]  How can we put us on a new course
[1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:14.020]  to restoring the Republic and saving America?
[1:34:14.020 --> 1:34:16.020]  Because America is a great country.
[1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:17.020]  There's so much going for it.
[1:34:17.020 --> 1:34:18.020]  We've got to defend it.
[1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:21.020]  We've got to keep it, get it back on track
[1:34:21.020 --> 1:34:24.020]  and stop these tyrants in Washington from stealing our future.
[1:34:24.020 --> 1:34:27.020]  Jonathan, go ahead and continue the point you left off on
[1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:29.020]  before the break, or you can start a new point.
[1:34:29.020 --> 1:34:34.020]  Well, the irony here is that those who are rapidly
[1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:40.020]  spending us into oblivion are going to achieve the very same...
[1:34:40.020 --> 1:34:44.020]  Okay, why don't you reconnect with Jonathan audio only?
[1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:46.020]  We would achieve...
[1:34:46.020 --> 1:34:48.020]  Sorry, we're having some connection issues
[1:34:48.020 --> 1:34:50.020]  with Jonathan Emoret there.
[1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:52.020]  Just go ahead and reconnect with him.
[1:34:52.020 --> 1:34:54.020]  But as I was saying, we're in so much trouble.
[1:34:54.020 --> 1:34:57.020]  I know some of the sponsors of this show
[1:34:57.020 --> 1:34:59.020]  have survival seed banks and things like that.
[1:34:59.020 --> 1:35:02.020]  Silver Lungs is a product that I really recommend.
[1:35:02.020 --> 1:35:06.020]  People, if you don't get yourself prepared this year,
[1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:10.020]  I mean now, really, it's already almost March of 2012.
[1:35:10.020 --> 1:35:12.020]  If you're not getting squared away,
[1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:14.020]  you are in deep, deep trouble.
[1:35:14.020 --> 1:35:17.020]  I mean, I've been planting trees
[1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:21.020]  and planting vegetables and practicing vermiculture,
[1:35:21.020 --> 1:35:25.020]  worm composting on my farm so I can turn food scraps into soil
[1:35:25.020 --> 1:35:27.020]  and the soil can feed the plants
[1:35:27.020 --> 1:35:29.020]  and the plants can keep us alive.
[1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:31.020]  I've been just almost urgently scrambling
[1:35:31.020 --> 1:35:33.020]  to get these skills together
[1:35:33.020 --> 1:35:36.020]  because something is coming, a collapse is coming.
[1:35:36.020 --> 1:35:39.020]  And let me know as soon as we have Jonathan back, guys.
[1:35:39.020 --> 1:35:41.020]  He's good, he's back with us.
[1:35:41.020 --> 1:35:43.020]  Okay, Jonathan, go...
[1:35:43.020 --> 1:35:45.020]  No, he's not back yet.
[1:35:45.020 --> 1:35:48.020]  Okay, sorry, but based on my analysis,
[1:35:48.020 --> 1:35:50.020]  the two most likely scenarios that we're facing are,
[1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:54.020]  number one, a grid down scenario, a loss of the power grid.
[1:35:54.020 --> 1:35:57.020]  That could be from a high altitude nuclear blast
[1:35:57.020 --> 1:35:59.020]  causing an EMP wave,
[1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:02.020]  which was discussed by a previous guest here with Alex Jones.
[1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:05.020]  I believe that guest was Matthew Stein, an MIT scientist,
[1:36:05.020 --> 1:36:07.020]  if I'm remembering correctly.
[1:36:07.020 --> 1:36:10.020]  A second possibility is a bioweapon release
[1:36:10.020 --> 1:36:13.020]  that could be intentional or unintentional.
[1:36:13.020 --> 1:36:15.020]  And I'm sort of going with the intentional side
[1:36:15.020 --> 1:36:17.020]  from the government, you know,
[1:36:17.020 --> 1:36:19.020]  the depopulation global elite
[1:36:19.020 --> 1:36:21.020]  who really do want to kill people.
[1:36:21.020 --> 1:36:23.020]  They're evil, they hate life,
[1:36:23.020 --> 1:36:25.020]  and they want to kill us off.
[1:36:25.020 --> 1:36:27.020]  And a bioweapon is a very, sadly,
[1:36:27.020 --> 1:36:29.020]  it's a very effective way to do that.
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:31.020]  So if you're not prepared for those two scenarios,
[1:36:31.020 --> 1:36:34.020]  grid down and bioweapon release,
[1:36:34.020 --> 1:36:36.020]  and I don't think you're prepared for the future
[1:36:36.020 --> 1:36:38.020]  that we may be facing,
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:40.020]  so I really want to urge you, you know,
[1:36:40.020 --> 1:36:42.020]  from me to you, all the listeners of InfoWars
[1:36:42.020 --> 1:36:44.020]  who are really informed, who are really patriotic,
[1:36:44.020 --> 1:36:46.020]  who are just some of the best people,
[1:36:46.020 --> 1:36:48.020]  the most amazing people in the country,
[1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:50.020]  you are the future of our society.
[1:36:50.020 --> 1:36:52.020]  You're the future of the human race,
[1:36:52.020 --> 1:36:54.020]  because you're not eating the GMOs.
[1:36:54.020 --> 1:36:56.020]  You're not destroying your fertility with vaccines.
[1:36:56.020 --> 1:36:58.020]  You're not killing yourself with all the chemicals,
[1:36:58.020 --> 1:37:00.020]  and you're, you know,
[1:37:00.020 --> 1:37:02.020]  you're eating the organics when you can,
[1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:04.020]  you're taking the superfoods when you can.
[1:37:04.020 --> 1:37:06.020]  You are the future of the human race,
[1:37:06.020 --> 1:37:08.020]  so I want to urge you to get prepared,
[1:37:08.020 --> 1:37:10.020]  stay alive, stay safe,
[1:37:10.020 --> 1:37:12.020]  and I want to urge you to get ready
[1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:14.020]  for the revolution as we restore this Republic.
[1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:16.020]  Now, Jonathan is back with us joining us.
[1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:18.020]  Again, Jonathan, go ahead, can you hear me?
[1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:20.020]  Yes, you know, the irony of all this
[1:37:20.020 --> 1:37:22.020]  is that the government is going to be reduced
[1:37:22.020 --> 1:37:24.020]  in its size and scope
[1:37:24.020 --> 1:37:26.020]  and cost
[1:37:26.020 --> 1:37:28.020]  by force
[1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:30.020]  or by
[1:37:30.020 --> 1:37:32.020]  volitionally through changes
[1:37:32.020 --> 1:37:34.020]  that,
[1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:36.020]  through changes that are brought about
[1:37:36.020 --> 1:37:38.020]  as a result of
[1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:40.020]  willingness to accept the reforms that are necessary.
[1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:42.020]  So either the government
[1:37:42.020 --> 1:37:44.020]  will do this volitionally
[1:37:44.020 --> 1:37:46.020]  or it will happen inevitably,
[1:37:46.020 --> 1:37:48.020]  because the government simply can't sustain itself
[1:37:48.020 --> 1:37:50.020]  at present levels indefinitely.
[1:37:50.020 --> 1:37:52.020]  Cannot happen.
[1:37:52.020 --> 1:37:54.020]  And in fact, it's likely to cause a reduction
[1:37:54.020 --> 1:37:56.020]  dissolution of the government
[1:37:56.020 --> 1:37:58.020]  within a decade.
[1:37:58.020 --> 1:38:00.020]  What does that look like if the government doesn't
[1:38:00.020 --> 1:38:02.020]  rein itself in
[1:38:02.020 --> 1:38:04.020]  and it blows through
[1:38:04.020 --> 1:38:06.020]  the, you know, the realistic boundaries
[1:38:06.020 --> 1:38:08.020]  of spending? I mean, what happens, really?
[1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:14.020]  What, in your opinion,
[1:38:14.020 --> 1:38:16.020]  I see we're having connection. Okay.
[1:38:16.020 --> 1:38:18.020]  Guys, just reconnect to him audio only.
[1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:20.020]  I think that'll work best.
[1:38:20.020 --> 1:38:22.020]  Well, what?
[1:38:22.020 --> 1:38:24.020]  Okay, I'm hearing little bits and pieces of him.
[1:38:24.020 --> 1:38:26.020]  Okay,
[1:38:26.020 --> 1:38:28.020]  I want to ask Jonathan when we reconnect with him
[1:38:28.020 --> 1:38:30.020]  what that looks like, and then I want to get to
[1:38:30.020 --> 1:38:32.020]  solutions, because his book is about solutions
[1:38:32.020 --> 1:38:34.020]  as well as not just what's wrong.
[1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:36.020]  That's the thing that you get here from
[1:38:36.020 --> 1:38:38.020]  Alex Jones' show and Info Wars
[1:38:38.020 --> 1:38:40.020]  is, yeah, we're going to be honest and up
[1:38:40.020 --> 1:38:42.020]  front about the problems that face our society
[1:38:42.020 --> 1:38:44.020]  about the loss of freedom, about the
[1:38:44.020 --> 1:38:46.020]  overzealous, tyrannical tendencies
[1:38:46.020 --> 1:38:48.020]  of the federal government,
[1:38:48.020 --> 1:38:50.020]  and it's mad departments
[1:38:50.020 --> 1:38:52.020]  like DHS,
[1:38:52.020 --> 1:38:54.020]  DEA,
[1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:56.020]  USDA, you name it. But we want to get to solutions.
[1:38:56.020 --> 1:38:58.020]  So what can we do as
[1:38:58.020 --> 1:39:00.020]  activists, as citizens, and
[1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:02.020]  so much of what you're doing out there is working.
[1:39:02.020 --> 1:39:04.020]  You know, you're succeeding in getting
[1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:06.020]  fluoride out of the water in many cities across
[1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:08.020]  the country. You're succeeding in many ways
[1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:10.020]  of defending the Bill of Rights, of defending
[1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:12.020]  the Second Amendment in some areas, of
[1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:14.020]  at least raising the issue of defending
[1:39:14.020 --> 1:39:16.020]  the Fourth Amendment in many areas.
[1:39:16.020 --> 1:39:18.020]  You, I mean, hey, even
[1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:20.020]  Wyoming, we covered that earlier, Wyoming is
[1:39:20.020 --> 1:39:22.020]  talking about having a plan to survive
[1:39:22.020 --> 1:39:24.020]  a national collapse.
[1:39:24.020 --> 1:39:26.020]  You know, they're talking about having their
[1:39:26.020 --> 1:39:28.020]  own strike aircraft and
[1:39:28.020 --> 1:39:30.020]  their own draft and their own military
[1:39:30.020 --> 1:39:32.020]  if it comes to that, their own currency
[1:39:32.020 --> 1:39:34.020]  if it comes to that.
[1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:36.020]  So there are people out there who are looking
[1:39:36.020 --> 1:39:38.020]  at solutions and saying, how do we keep
[1:39:38.020 --> 1:39:40.020]  all of this alive so that we can move
[1:39:40.020 --> 1:39:42.020]  forward? Now, Jonathan's back with us. Go ahead,
[1:39:42.020 --> 1:39:44.020]  Jonathan, where you left off.
[1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:46.020]  Well, this is going to the destruction
[1:39:46.020 --> 1:39:48.020]  of the Republic will happen if
[1:39:48.020 --> 1:39:50.020]  the political people will not
[1:39:50.020 --> 1:39:52.020]  take the steps necessary to downsize
[1:39:52.020 --> 1:39:54.020]  the government dramatically. I mean, we need to do
[1:39:54.020 --> 1:39:56.020]  what Ron Paul's calling for, trillion dollars
[1:39:56.020 --> 1:39:58.020]  in spending cuts now.
[1:39:58.020 --> 1:40:00.020]  We can't afford 200 billion
[1:40:00.020 --> 1:40:02.020]  to 400 billion a year when we're spending
[1:40:02.020 --> 1:40:04.020]  1.3 trillion in excessive
[1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:06.020]  receipts. It's just not
[1:40:06.020 --> 1:40:08.020]  sustainable. We have 62 trillion
[1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:10.020]  dollars in entitlement
[1:40:10.020 --> 1:40:12.020]  commitments presently and that figure is going
[1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:14.020]  to rise as the boomer
[1:40:14.020 --> 1:40:16.020]  population gets bigger and bigger
[1:40:16.020 --> 1:40:18.020]  and federal spending commitments that are
[1:40:18.020 --> 1:40:20.020]  added on through Obamacare
[1:40:20.020 --> 1:40:22.020]  add more to the national debt. So
[1:40:22.020 --> 1:40:24.020]  we're in a situation that is absolutely
[1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:26.020]  unsustainable. The government will collapse
[1:40:26.020 --> 1:40:28.020]  of its own accord unless dramatic
[1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:30.020]  reductions take place. All right, well, what will
[1:40:30.020 --> 1:40:32.020]  happen? What is the sequence of events?
[1:40:32.020 --> 1:40:34.020]  Well, we're going to see
[1:40:34.020 --> 1:40:36.020]  something obvious, which is further
[1:40:36.020 --> 1:40:38.020]  degradation in the Americans
[1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:40.020]  the American
[1:40:40.020 --> 1:40:42.020]  credit rating. It's not simply
[1:40:42.020 --> 1:40:44.020]  going to be
[1:40:44.020 --> 1:40:46.020]  a recognition by credit agencies
[1:40:46.020 --> 1:40:48.020]  that we have poor credit.
[1:40:48.020 --> 1:40:50.020]  It's going to be a realization by those
[1:40:50.020 --> 1:40:52.020]  countries like Japan and China
[1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:54.020]  that have lent us money that
[1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:56.020]  we're becoming an increasingly grave risk
[1:40:56.020 --> 1:40:58.020]  for return on investment. So what are
[1:40:58.020 --> 1:41:00.020]  they going to do? Well, they're going to use
[1:41:00.020 --> 1:41:02.020]  the advantage politically
[1:41:02.020 --> 1:41:04.020]  to coerce and cajole us, to put us
[1:41:04.020 --> 1:41:06.020]  in a position where we
[1:41:06.020 --> 1:41:08.020]  damage the relationships with our friends
[1:41:08.020 --> 1:41:10.020]  in order to sustain
[1:41:10.020 --> 1:41:12.020]  the money flow from coming from these countries
[1:41:12.020 --> 1:41:14.020]  and also put us in
[1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:16.020]  a financial blackmail environment
[1:41:16.020 --> 1:41:18.020]  there. But also what's going
[1:41:18.020 --> 1:41:20.020]  to happen is that inflationary
[1:41:20.020 --> 1:41:22.020]  effects are going to eliminate
[1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:24.020]  the economic benefit
[1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:26.020]  of any of the benefits the government
[1:41:26.020 --> 1:41:28.020]  provides and also destroy the economy
[1:41:28.020 --> 1:41:30.020]  at the same time. There's no way
[1:41:30.020 --> 1:41:32.020]  that you can maintain this level of spending
[1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:34.020]  and inflation of the money supply
[1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:36.020]  and not have it reverberate
[1:41:36.020 --> 1:41:38.020]  into the market and cause
[1:41:38.020 --> 1:41:40.020]  extreme inflation. So we're going to end up
[1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:42.020]  with hyperinflation. We're going
[1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:44.020]  to end up with a diminution
[1:41:44.020 --> 1:41:46.020]  in the availability of
[1:41:46.020 --> 1:41:48.020]  federal benefits
[1:41:48.020 --> 1:41:50.020]  because of the fact that those
[1:41:50.020 --> 1:41:52.020]  who provide them simply cannot economically
[1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:54.020]  afford to provide them.
[1:41:54.020 --> 1:41:56.020]  Is that, Jonathan,
[1:41:56.020 --> 1:41:58.020]  why you think there has been a ramp up
[1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:00.020]  in activity at FEMA camps?
[1:42:00.020 --> 1:42:02.020]  Why there's more talk
[1:42:02.020 --> 1:42:04.020]  of taking away the rights to protest
[1:42:04.020 --> 1:42:06.020]  requiring
[1:42:06.020 --> 1:42:08.020]  a permit to protest?
[1:42:08.020 --> 1:42:10.020]  Is there an anticipation
[1:42:10.020 --> 1:42:12.020]  of a coming federal collapse that's causing
[1:42:12.020 --> 1:42:14.020]  the government right now to clamp down
[1:42:14.020 --> 1:42:16.020]  on rights ahead of time?
[1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:18.020]  Well, there is some of that, but there's also
[1:42:18.020 --> 1:42:20.020]  a view
[1:42:20.020 --> 1:42:22.020]  by politicians which is very
[1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:24.020]  grossly irresponsible and that is that
[1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:26.020]  as long as they can maintain the
[1:42:26.020 --> 1:42:28.020]  spending spree for a time
[1:42:28.020 --> 1:42:30.020]  at least past the time that they retire from
[1:42:30.020 --> 1:42:32.020]  office, they can leave it to somebody else
[1:42:32.020 --> 1:42:34.020]  to solve. That's basically the Obama
[1:42:34.020 --> 1:42:36.020]  approach to this. He's not
[1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:38.020]  going to take the debt seriously because he anticipates
[1:42:38.020 --> 1:42:40.020]  that
[1:42:40.020 --> 1:42:42.020]  the rubber is going to hit the road and
[1:42:42.020 --> 1:42:44.020]  really destroy the United States after
[1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:46.020]  he leaves office from the second term.
[1:42:46.020 --> 1:42:48.020]  And it's not a situation
[1:42:48.020 --> 1:42:50.020]  where any member of Congress,
[1:42:50.020 --> 1:42:52.020]  Republican or Democrat with very few
[1:42:52.020 --> 1:42:54.020]  exceptions, is willing to do
[1:42:54.020 --> 1:42:56.020]  what is necessary to save the
[1:42:56.020 --> 1:42:58.020]  country. As a consequence, we have to
[1:42:58.020 --> 1:43:00.020]  commence and maintain a national
[1:43:00.020 --> 1:43:02.020]  movement that calls into question
[1:43:02.020 --> 1:43:04.020]  the actions that are taken that are unconstitutional,
[1:43:04.020 --> 1:43:06.020]  demands that
[1:43:06.020 --> 1:43:08.020]  the government be brought back in line
[1:43:08.020 --> 1:43:10.020]  with the constitutional requirements
[1:43:10.020 --> 1:43:12.020]  and votes into office those who favor
[1:43:12.020 --> 1:43:14.020]  those positions and demands from them
[1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:16.020]  essentially pledges to
[1:43:16.020 --> 1:43:18.020]  achieve that end. Ultimately
[1:43:18.020 --> 1:43:20.020]  the typical good
[1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:22.020]  American citizen who appreciates
[1:43:22.020 --> 1:43:24.020]  the necessity of this, many of whom
[1:43:24.020 --> 1:43:26.020]  are Tea Party people who've run
[1:43:26.020 --> 1:43:28.020]  for office in the past,
[1:43:28.020 --> 1:43:30.020]  will have to run increasingly for office
[1:43:30.020 --> 1:43:32.020]  and take back the government.
[1:43:32.020 --> 1:43:34.020]  We have to be able to pass
[1:43:34.020 --> 1:43:36.020]  through legislation that will
[1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:38.020]  break down the government and will
[1:43:38.020 --> 1:43:40.020]  privatize entitlements.
[1:43:40.020 --> 1:43:42.020]  We need to go through a system of
[1:43:42.020 --> 1:43:44.020]  second bests. I identify in the book
[1:43:44.020 --> 1:43:46.020]  where we start
[1:43:46.020 --> 1:43:48.020]  with this environment of second bests.
[1:43:48.020 --> 1:43:50.020]  We would have been better had we not gotten
[1:43:50.020 --> 1:43:52.020]  involved with Social Security and Medicare
[1:43:52.020 --> 1:43:54.020]  and Medicaid to begin with. But having
[1:43:54.020 --> 1:43:56.020]  gotten there, how do we wean
[1:43:56.020 --> 1:43:58.020]  the American public from it? And what I
[1:43:58.020 --> 1:44:00.020]  offer is a system of modifications
[1:44:00.020 --> 1:44:02.020]  of the corporate and individual income tax
[1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:04.020]  to achieve that. Part of my plan
[1:44:04.020 --> 1:44:06.020]  would eliminate the individual
[1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:08.020]  income tax, phasing it out of existence.
[1:44:08.020 --> 1:44:10.020]  But during a transition period
[1:44:10.020 --> 1:44:12.020]  I used tax
[1:44:12.020 --> 1:44:14.020]  breaks for corporations
[1:44:14.020 --> 1:44:16.020]  to enable them to pick up
[1:44:16.020 --> 1:44:18.020]  responsibility and care
[1:44:18.020 --> 1:44:20.020]  for the indigent as we wean
[1:44:20.020 --> 1:44:22.020]  the government of
[1:44:22.020 --> 1:44:24.020]  that role. But you're
[1:44:24.020 --> 1:44:26.020]  fighting against total
[1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:28.020]  economic insanity in Washington and as
[1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.020]  a great example of that
[1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:32.020]  weekly standard care in a story
[1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:34.020]  quoting Valerie Jarrett who is
[1:44:34.020 --> 1:44:36.020]  a senior advisor to the White House,
[1:44:36.020 --> 1:44:38.020]  she says that people
[1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:40.020]  who receive unemployment checks
[1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:42.020]  go out and spend it and help stimulate
[1:44:42.020 --> 1:44:44.020]  the economy. So I guess
[1:44:44.020 --> 1:44:46.020]  in her mind and in many of those in Washington
[1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:48.020]  the way to have abundance in America
[1:44:48.020 --> 1:44:50.020]  is to make sure that everybody's
[1:44:50.020 --> 1:44:52.020]  jobless and spending unemployment
[1:44:52.020 --> 1:44:54.020]  checks. Well, they advocate
[1:44:54.020 --> 1:44:56.020]  a nation of dependency and they also
[1:44:56.020 --> 1:44:58.020]  create this
[1:44:58.020 --> 1:45:00.020]  deception for the poor. It's a kiss of death
[1:45:00.020 --> 1:45:02.020]  to the poor from the Obama
[1:45:02.020 --> 1:45:04.020]  administration that if they rely
[1:45:04.020 --> 1:45:06.020]  on these government programs, which
[1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:08.020]  will only take a fraction of them
[1:45:08.020 --> 1:45:10.020]  and provide them with anything of economic
[1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:12.020]  value, the rest are just given this
[1:45:12.020 --> 1:45:14.020]  blank promise which can never be fulfilled.
[1:45:14.020 --> 1:45:16.020]  But the notion that
[1:45:16.020 --> 1:45:18.020]  we will tax the country
[1:45:18.020 --> 1:45:20.020]  and redistribute the wealth
[1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:22.020]  to those elements of society
[1:45:22.020 --> 1:45:24.020]  that are indigent
[1:45:24.020 --> 1:45:26.020]  and not have an adverse effect upon
[1:45:26.020 --> 1:45:28.020]  unemployment is
[1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:30.020]  ridiculous. If you take
[1:45:30.020 --> 1:45:32.020]  from the most productive elements of society
[1:45:32.020 --> 1:45:34.020]  the reserve
[1:45:34.020 --> 1:45:36.020]  of wealth that they count upon
[1:45:36.020 --> 1:45:38.020]  for investment, saving
[1:45:38.020 --> 1:45:40.020]  and innovation
[1:45:40.020 --> 1:45:42.020]  you dry up the pool
[1:45:42.020 --> 1:45:44.020]  necessary to increase
[1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:46.020]  employment, increase
[1:45:46.020 --> 1:45:48.020]  private sector employment. And so
[1:45:48.020 --> 1:45:50.020]  the president would like to take those
[1:45:50.020 --> 1:45:52.020]  reserves of wealth and bring them to the
[1:45:52.020 --> 1:45:54.020]  government
[1:45:54.020 --> 1:45:56.020]  not articulating the fact that
[1:45:56.020 --> 1:45:58.020]  that's going to cause a dramatic
[1:45:58.020 --> 1:46:00.020]  increase in unemployment as these
[1:46:00.020 --> 1:46:02.020]  individuals are incapable of
[1:46:02.020 --> 1:46:04.020]  spending the money necessary to be competitive
[1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:06.020]  in the market. And at the same time
[1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:08.020]  create these
[1:46:08.020 --> 1:46:10.020]  superficial
[1:46:10.020 --> 1:46:12.020]  retraining programs
[1:46:12.020 --> 1:46:14.020]  and public works programs
[1:46:14.020 --> 1:46:16.020]  and more money for teachers and more
[1:46:16.020 --> 1:46:18.020]  money for police which is
[1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:20.020]  a dead end investment because
[1:46:20.020 --> 1:46:22.020]  you have to put that money back in there
[1:46:22.020 --> 1:46:24.020]  every single year from the government
[1:46:24.020 --> 1:46:26.020]  in order to maintain
[1:46:26.020 --> 1:46:28.020]  the
[1:46:28.020 --> 1:46:30.020]  programs and furthermore
[1:46:30.020 --> 1:46:32.020]  they're out of sync with the market. What
[1:46:32.020 --> 1:46:34.020]  we want is to liberate the market
[1:46:34.020 --> 1:46:36.020]  so that employment levels
[1:46:36.020 --> 1:46:38.020]  can increase and so that we
[1:46:38.020 --> 1:46:40.020]  can become a nation that is competitive with
[1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:42.020]  the rest of the world and that provides
[1:46:42.020 --> 1:46:44.020]  a growth in the
[1:46:44.020 --> 1:46:46.020]  economic pie instead of having
[1:46:46.020 --> 1:46:48.020]  a static pie that we continuously
[1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:50.020]  carve apart
[1:46:50.020 --> 1:46:52.020]  and remove into the government sector.
[1:46:52.020 --> 1:46:54.020]  But again, Jonathan you're coming at this
[1:46:54.020 --> 1:46:56.020]  from the point of view of being a rational person who wants
[1:46:56.020 --> 1:46:58.020]  to help the nation and help the people
[1:46:58.020 --> 1:47:00.020]  and
[1:47:00.020 --> 1:47:02.020]  those in charge today who have the political
[1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:04.020]  clout and the power who make the economic
[1:47:04.020 --> 1:47:06.020]  decisions, the evidence
[1:47:06.020 --> 1:47:08.020]  is increasingly just
[1:47:08.020 --> 1:47:10.020]  readily apparent that they want
[1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:12.020]  to destroy this nation.
[1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:14.020]  So getting to the solution section
[1:47:14.020 --> 1:47:16.020]  how do the citizens
[1:47:16.020 --> 1:47:18.020]  how do the activists
[1:47:18.020 --> 1:47:20.020]  how do the free people of America
[1:47:20.020 --> 1:47:22.020]  take part in a real
[1:47:22.020 --> 1:47:24.020]  peaceful revolution of taking
[1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:26.020]  back their power and restoring
[1:47:26.020 --> 1:47:28.020]  economic sanity among other things
[1:47:28.020 --> 1:47:30.020]  to America?
[1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:32.020]  Well there has to be a focal point
[1:47:32.020 --> 1:47:34.020]  and many of the campaigns have provided
[1:47:34.020 --> 1:47:36.020]  an opportunity for people
[1:47:36.020 --> 1:47:38.020]  to see things that may prove
[1:47:38.020 --> 1:47:40.020]  this the
[1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:42.020]  alternative vision of freedom and the
[1:47:42.020 --> 1:47:44.020]  constitution a reality again
[1:47:44.020 --> 1:47:46.020]  such as the Ron Paul campaign
[1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:48.020]  but the point
[1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:50.020]  what I'm doing is starting
[1:47:50.020 --> 1:47:52.020]  a national movement to restore
[1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:54.020]  the republic. We have an e-news letter
[1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:56.020]  that's coming out in April
[1:47:56.020 --> 1:47:58.020]  that will be a focal
[1:47:58.020 --> 1:48:00.020]  point identifying specific instances
[1:48:00.020 --> 1:48:02.020]  of government abuse in the bureaucracy, the
[1:48:02.020 --> 1:48:04.020]  executive branch, congress that violate the
[1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:06.020]  constitution, specific means by which
[1:48:06.020 --> 1:48:08.020]  to protest those actions
[1:48:08.020 --> 1:48:10.020]  and then also
[1:48:10.020 --> 1:48:12.020]  we're going to demand that
[1:48:12.020 --> 1:48:14.020]  elected representatives agree to a platform
[1:48:14.020 --> 1:48:16.020]  that will result in a restoration
[1:48:16.020 --> 1:48:18.020]  of the republic and restoration
[1:48:18.020 --> 1:48:20.020]  of the constitution. Where can people sign up
[1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:22.020]  for that e-news letter at emord.com?
[1:48:22.020 --> 1:48:24.020]  Yeah it will be through emord.com
[1:48:24.020 --> 1:48:26.020]  it will also be restoretherepublic.co
[1:48:26.020 --> 1:48:28.020]  and it's under construction
[1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:30.020]  right now but April 1
[1:48:30.020 --> 1:48:32.020]  it will be available
[1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:34.020]  and we're going to try
[1:48:34.020 --> 1:48:36.020]  to create this national movement
[1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:38.020]  and push very strongly
[1:48:38.020 --> 1:48:40.020]  for the specific purpose of restoring the republic
[1:48:40.020 --> 1:48:42.020]  restoring the constitutional principles
[1:48:42.020 --> 1:48:44.020]  and limits
[1:48:44.020 --> 1:48:46.020]  on government power and removing
[1:48:46.020 --> 1:48:48.020]  from office those members of congress
[1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:50.020]  and the senate who are derelict in their
[1:48:50.020 --> 1:48:52.020]  responsibilities of upholding their oath of
[1:48:52.020 --> 1:48:54.020]  office in the constitution. So
[1:48:54.020 --> 1:48:56.020]  we're moving in that direction. I think that
[1:48:56.020 --> 1:48:58.020]  as the crisis continues
[1:48:58.020 --> 1:49:00.020]  as circumstances
[1:49:00.020 --> 1:49:02.020]  worsen with the debt, as circumstances
[1:49:02.020 --> 1:49:04.020]  worsen and make it
[1:49:04.020 --> 1:49:06.020]  apparent to virtually every American that
[1:49:06.020 --> 1:49:08.020]  they're not going to get social security
[1:49:08.020 --> 1:49:10.020]  they're not going to have as
[1:49:10.020 --> 1:49:12.020]  read as promised
[1:49:12.020 --> 1:49:14.020]  social security as we know it, it's just not
[1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:16.020]  going to exist. It cannot be afforded
[1:49:16.020 --> 1:49:18.020]  by this government and medicare
[1:49:18.020 --> 1:49:20.020]  and medicaid have to change.
[1:49:20.020 --> 1:49:22.020]  The need is to
[1:49:22.020 --> 1:49:24.020]  ensure that those who are dependent upon these
[1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:26.020]  systems are transitioned
[1:49:26.020 --> 1:49:28.020]  into a private environment
[1:49:28.020 --> 1:49:30.020]  where companies take on the responsibility
[1:49:30.020 --> 1:49:32.020]  of caring and supporting
[1:49:32.020 --> 1:49:34.020]  those who are incapable of caring
[1:49:34.020 --> 1:49:36.020]  for themselves. And that can
[1:49:36.020 --> 1:49:38.020]  be done if the government will give
[1:49:38.020 --> 1:49:40.020]  a $1.50
[1:49:40.020 --> 1:49:42.020]  tax deduction for every $1
[1:49:42.020 --> 1:49:44.020]  that a company expends to assist
[1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:46.020]  in providing medical care, to assist in providing
[1:49:46.020 --> 1:49:48.020]  retirement benefits
[1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:50.020]  and so forth for those who are
[1:49:50.020 --> 1:49:52.020]  indigent. And there's no reason
[1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:54.020]  why this can't happen. It's so easy
[1:49:54.020 --> 1:49:56.020]  actually in America to solve the health care
[1:49:56.020 --> 1:49:58.020]  problem. All we have to do is stop poisoning everybody
[1:49:58.020 --> 1:50:00.020]  get the fluoride out of the water, get the GMOs out of the
[1:50:00.020 --> 1:50:02.020]  food, get the toxic pesticides
[1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:04.020]  out of the food, you get the additives.
[1:50:04.020 --> 1:50:06.020]  I mean we're being poisoned and if you take that away
[1:50:06.020 --> 1:50:08.020]  health care costs drop. I know that's a separate issue
[1:50:08.020 --> 1:50:10.020]  from what you mentioned. We've only got about a minute
[1:50:10.020 --> 1:50:12.020]  left before the break Jonathan
[1:50:12.020 --> 1:50:14.020]  but can you talk about Ron Paul
[1:50:14.020 --> 1:50:16.020]  writing the intro for your book very quickly.
[1:50:16.020 --> 1:50:18.020]  How did you get Ron Paul to do that?
[1:50:18.020 --> 1:50:20.020]  He's a busy guy these days. Well
[1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:22.020]  I work rather regularly
[1:50:22.020 --> 1:50:24.020]  with their office. I've drafted several
[1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:26.020]  pieces of legislation for his office
[1:50:26.020 --> 1:50:28.020]  and in the
[1:50:28.020 --> 1:50:30.020]  course of discussing my plans
[1:50:30.020 --> 1:50:32.020]  to write this book I was
[1:50:32.020 --> 1:50:34.020]  surprised pleasantly
[1:50:34.020 --> 1:50:36.020]  when they offered to write
[1:50:36.020 --> 1:50:38.020]  the forward. Alright well
[1:50:38.020 --> 1:50:40.020]  will you stay with us one more segment there
[1:50:40.020 --> 1:50:42.020]  Jonathan? Sure. We've got more
[1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:44.020]  questions for you and for those listening
[1:50:44.020 --> 1:50:46.020]  this is an interview with Jonathan Emored
[1:50:46.020 --> 1:50:48.020]  here on the Alex Jones show. Thank you
[1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:50.020]  for staying with us. We'll be right back

[1:50:56.020 --> 1:51:02.020]  Music
[1:51:02.020 --> 1:51:04.020]  Folks, Iran and the
[1:51:04.020 --> 1:51:06.020]  Middle East nuclear mess is already

[1:51:16.020 --> 1:51:18.020]  is all you'll get because of huge

[1:53:00.020 --> 1:53:02.020]  Do you know which 37
[1:53:02.020 --> 1:53:04.020]  crucial food items are going to fly off
[1:53:04.020 --> 1:53:06.020]  the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[1:53:06.020 --> 1:53:08.020]  If you don't, you and your family may be
[1:53:08.020 --> 1:53:10.020]  without food and waiting in long food lines
[1:53:10.020 --> 1:53:12.020]  after a big disaster strikes.
[1:53:12.020 --> 1:53:14.020]  You would be surprised how many people
[1:53:14.020 --> 1:53:16.020]  don't have these food items right now.

[1:53:22.020 --> 1:53:24.020]  on the 37 food items. It will sell out
[1:53:24.020 --> 1:53:26.020]  first when the next disaster strikes.

[1:53:34.020 --> 1:53:36.020]  natural or man-made.
[1:53:36.020 --> 1:53:38.020]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry
[1:53:38.020 --> 1:53:40.020]  for being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.

[1:54:18.020 --> 1:54:20.020]  We're back with
[1:54:20.020 --> 1:54:22.020]  Jonathan Emoret, author of
[1:54:22.020 --> 1:54:24.020]  Restore the Republic, a very important
[1:54:24.020 --> 1:54:26.020]  new book that lays out a pathway
[1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:28.020]  to actually protecting
[1:54:28.020 --> 1:54:30.020]  the future of freedom in America.
[1:54:30.020 --> 1:54:32.020]  Jonathan Emoret joins us
[1:54:32.020 --> 1:54:34.020]  by phone to continue
[1:54:34.020 --> 1:54:36.020]  that discussion. Jonathan,
[1:54:36.020 --> 1:54:38.020]  we were talking about solutions and what people
[1:54:38.020 --> 1:54:40.020]  can do right now, what activists can do right now.
[1:54:40.020 --> 1:54:42.020]  That's what people are hungry for. They want
[1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:44.020]  to be part of a solution. They don't want to see this
[1:54:44.020 --> 1:54:46.020]  country just fail and collapse into
[1:54:46.020 --> 1:54:48.020]  total destruction.
[1:54:48.020 --> 1:54:50.020]  Continue along those lines, please. What can people
[1:54:50.020 --> 1:54:52.020]  do right now to be part of the solution?
[1:54:52.020 --> 1:54:54.020]  We're creating this e-newsletter
[1:54:54.020 --> 1:54:56.020]  as a focal point to identify
[1:54:56.020 --> 1:54:58.020]  each of the specific instances where the
[1:54:58.020 --> 1:55:00.020]  administration, the bureaucracy,
[1:55:00.020 --> 1:55:02.020]  Congress, the executive branch
[1:55:02.020 --> 1:55:04.020]  deviates from the requirements
[1:55:04.020 --> 1:55:06.020]  of the Constitution, violates the Constitution,
[1:55:06.020 --> 1:55:08.020]  and also on this fiscal irresponsibility,
[1:55:08.020 --> 1:55:10.020]  identifying specific measures
[1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:12.020]  that threaten to destroy the country
[1:55:12.020 --> 1:55:14.020]  and to advocate
[1:55:14.020 --> 1:55:16.020]  reform, and to do so
[1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:18.020]  both with the
[1:55:18.020 --> 1:55:20.020]  support of
[1:55:20.020 --> 1:55:22.020]  politicians in support who are in favor
[1:55:22.020 --> 1:55:24.020]  of the principles that we articulate
[1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:26.020]  which are in favor of the Constitution
[1:55:26.020 --> 1:55:28.020]  and to attack those who are not
[1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:30.020]  and also to
[1:55:30.020 --> 1:55:32.020]  demand that specific changes
[1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:34.020]  be made to alter the course
[1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:36.020]  of this government into a
[1:55:36.020 --> 1:55:38.020]  constitutional direction. So it's
[1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:40.020]  an ongoing thing. It's a monthly
[1:55:40.020 --> 1:55:42.020]  e-newsletter. We're looking to create
[1:55:42.020 --> 1:55:44.020]  a movement to restore the Republic.
[1:55:44.020 --> 1:55:46.020]  We're using that rubric, Restore the
[1:55:46.020 --> 1:55:48.020]  Republic, to identify all those
[1:55:48.020 --> 1:55:50.020]  people in this country who are advocates
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.020]  of the Constitution, asking them
[1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:54.020]  to come on board and help us
[1:55:54.020 --> 1:55:56.020]  in this movement to do this. We're hoping to get
[1:55:56.020 --> 1:55:58.020]  large numbers of people behind
[1:55:58.020 --> 1:56:00.020]  the movement and to become
[1:56:00.020 --> 1:56:02.020]  a critical voice in the evolution
[1:56:02.020 --> 1:56:04.020]  of this country.
[1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.020]  The book Restore the Republic
[1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:08.020]  is an ambitious undertaking on my part
[1:56:08.020 --> 1:56:10.020]  but I have identified
[1:56:10.020 --> 1:56:12.020]  the means to
[1:56:12.020 --> 1:56:14.020]  eliminate the federal government's
[1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:16.020]  cost to an extent that would permit a balanced
[1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:18.020]  budget by eliminating
[1:56:18.020 --> 1:56:20.020]  several federal departments, several
[1:56:20.020 --> 1:56:22.020]  federal agencies, and taking
[1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:24.020]  Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid
[1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:26.020]  and privatizing it so that those who are
[1:56:26.020 --> 1:56:28.020]  dependent upon those systems are
[1:56:28.020 --> 1:56:30.020]  covered by tax deductions
[1:56:30.020 --> 1:56:32.020]  given to corporations
[1:56:32.020 --> 1:56:34.020]  enabling them to
[1:56:34.020 --> 1:56:36.020]  provide this large yes in lieu
[1:56:36.020 --> 1:56:38.020]  of the government. Basically the whole
[1:56:38.020 --> 1:56:40.020]  system is to empower individuals
[1:56:40.020 --> 1:56:42.020]  and depower the federal government.
[1:56:42.020 --> 1:56:44.020]  Alright, that makes perfect sense and right now
[1:56:44.020 --> 1:56:46.020]  I'm going to pledge to you some software
[1:56:46.020 --> 1:56:48.020]  technology. I found that a software
[1:56:48.020 --> 1:56:50.020]  company almost 20 years ago
[1:56:50.020 --> 1:56:52.020]  that can handle sending out
[1:56:52.020 --> 1:56:54.020]  very large volumes of emails to opt-in
[1:56:54.020 --> 1:56:56.020]  subscribers. So I'd like to donate
[1:56:56.020 --> 1:56:58.020]  that to your organization and help support
[1:56:58.020 --> 1:57:00.020]  your message to bring you subscribers.
[1:57:00.020 --> 1:57:02.020]  You'll need good technology to send out
[1:57:02.020 --> 1:57:04.020]  email to millions of people which I'm sure
[1:57:04.020 --> 1:57:06.020]  this will grow to. Let me also give you
[1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:08.020]  the Rick Perry quiz. Can you name
[1:57:08.020 --> 1:57:10.020]  three government agencies to eliminate?
[1:57:10.020 --> 1:57:12.020]  Very easy.
[1:57:12.020 --> 1:57:14.020]  Take the Federal Communications
[1:57:14.020 --> 1:57:16.020]  Commission. It can be privatized. There's
[1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:18.020]  no reason why the government should own the airwaves.
[1:57:18.020 --> 1:57:20.020]  It can be a complete
[1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:22.020]  private system. We can take the Federal
[1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:24.020]  Food and Drug Administration and we can
[1:57:24.020 --> 1:57:26.020]  eliminate its drug approval process and its
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:28.020]  medical device approval process by making
[1:57:28.020 --> 1:57:30.020]  that a university-based system and having
[1:57:30.020 --> 1:57:32.020]  a blinded system of review take
[1:57:32.020 --> 1:57:34.020]  place at the universities which is presumptively
[1:57:34.020 --> 1:57:36.020]  a determination of safety and efficacy.
[1:57:36.020 --> 1:57:38.020]  We can eliminate the Environmental Protection
[1:57:38.020 --> 1:57:40.020]  Agency. There's absolutely no reason why
[1:57:40.020 --> 1:57:42.020]  local health and safety can't protect
[1:57:42.020 --> 1:57:44.020]  us from environmental pollutants and
[1:57:44.020 --> 1:57:46.020]  going after companies that are responsible
[1:57:46.020 --> 1:57:48.020]  for trespass or otherwise
[1:57:48.020 --> 1:57:50.020]  disturbing the environment. We can
[1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:52.020]  eliminate the Department of
[1:57:52.020 --> 1:57:54.020]  Commerce. There's no reason why we should
[1:57:54.020 --> 1:57:56.020]  have a Department of Commerce, really. Why should
[1:57:56.020 --> 1:57:58.020]  the federal government be involved in that?
[1:57:58.020 --> 1:58:00.020]  We can eliminate the Department of Education
[1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:02.020]  and very well should because the Department
[1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:04.020]  of Education is a federal system that's destroying
[1:58:04.020 --> 1:58:06.020]  education in this country. What we need
[1:58:06.020 --> 1:58:08.020]  are more private incentives in education.
[1:58:08.020 --> 1:58:10.020]  Those are just a few. The big government
[1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:12.020]  people like to say, well, how can you be
[1:58:12.020 --> 1:58:14.020]  against education? How can you be against the
[1:58:14.020 --> 1:58:16.020]  environment? You're not. Actually, the Department
[1:58:16.020 --> 1:58:18.020]  of Education is anti-education. The
[1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:20.020]  EPA is anti-environment. The FDA
[1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:22.020]  is anti-health. I mean, that's the issue.
[1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:24.020]  And the Department of Energy is anti-energy.
[1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:26.020]  We need to get rid of the Department of Energy
[1:58:26.020 --> 1:58:28.020]  as well. But there are many listed in the book
[1:58:28.020 --> 1:58:30.020]  precisely how it can be done and the cost savings
[1:58:30.020 --> 1:58:32.020]  that come from eliminating it. Alright, stay with
[1:58:32.020 --> 1:58:34.020]  us if you would. Going to a quick break
[1:58:34.020 --> 1:58:36.020]  we'll be right back with more with Jonathan
[1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:38.020]  Ford, author of Restore the Republic. Please
[1:58:38.020 --> 1:59:07.020]  listen to Jonathan, straight ahead.

[2:00:22.020 --> 2:00:24.020]  We are live from Austin, Texas,
[2:00:24.020 --> 2:00:26.020]  but this isn't Alex today. This is
[2:00:26.020 --> 2:00:28.020]  Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in
[2:00:28.020 --> 2:00:30.020]  for Alex, who is on the road. We're
[2:00:30.020 --> 2:00:32.020]  continuing our interview with Jonathan
[2:00:32.020 --> 2:00:34.020]  Emoret, author of Restore the Republic.
[2:00:34.020 --> 2:00:36.020]  And in fact, I've got a quote from
[2:00:36.020 --> 2:00:38.020]  Gandhi here that I wanted to bring in
[2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:40.020]  because it reminds me of the kind of
[2:00:40.020 --> 2:00:42.020]  ethics and courage that Jonathan
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:44.020]  Emoret brings to every issue.
[2:00:44.020 --> 2:00:46.020]  Gandhi says, quote, many people,
[2:00:46.020 --> 2:00:48.020]  especially ignorant people,
[2:00:48.020 --> 2:00:50.020]  want to punish you for speaking the truth,
[2:00:50.020 --> 2:00:52.020]  for being correct, for being you.
[2:00:52.020 --> 2:00:54.020]  Never apologize for being correct
[2:00:54.020 --> 2:00:56.020]  or for being years ahead of your time.
[2:00:56.020 --> 2:00:58.020]  If you're right and you know it,
[2:00:58.020 --> 2:01:00.020]  speak your mind. Even if you are
[2:01:00.020 --> 2:01:02.020]  a minority of one, the truth is still
[2:01:02.020 --> 2:01:04.020]  the truth. That's, of course,
[2:01:04.020 --> 2:01:06.020]  a quote from Gandhi.
[2:01:06.020 --> 2:01:08.020]  Jonathan, thanks for
[2:01:08.020 --> 2:01:10.020]  staying with us for this additional
[2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:12.020]  five minutes. What else can you tell
[2:01:12.020 --> 2:01:14.020]  us about what we need to do right now
[2:01:14.020 --> 2:01:16.020]  to restore the Republic?
[2:01:16.020 --> 2:01:18.020]  Well, the good news is that
[2:01:18.020 --> 2:01:20.020]  liberty is the inevitable condition
[2:01:20.020 --> 2:01:22.020]  of the government. Despite the fact
[2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:24.020]  that governments are our own now and
[2:01:24.020 --> 2:01:26.020]  governments historically have endeavored
[2:01:26.020 --> 2:01:28.020]  to take away individual liberty and
[2:01:28.020 --> 2:01:30.020]  to deprive people of freedom of choice,
[2:01:30.020 --> 2:01:32.020]  that has invariably failed.
[2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:34.020]  And the sad lesson
[2:01:34.020 --> 2:01:36.020]  that this government is going to learn
[2:01:36.020 --> 2:01:38.020]  is that you may not enslave
[2:01:38.020 --> 2:01:40.020]  the entire American population
[2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:42.020]  without the consequence that
[2:01:42.020 --> 2:01:44.020]  a country dependent upon their
[2:01:44.020 --> 2:01:46.020]  earnings to
[2:01:46.020 --> 2:01:48.020]  survive, a parasitic government
[2:01:48.020 --> 2:01:50.020]  those earnings to
[2:01:50.020 --> 2:01:52.020]  operate its machinery
[2:01:52.020 --> 2:01:54.020]  will collapse of its own weight
[2:01:54.020 --> 2:01:56.020]  if it deprives people of the
[2:01:56.020 --> 2:01:58.020]  freedom necessary to make a living.
[2:01:58.020 --> 2:02:00.020]  And that's where we're at. We're at this point
[2:02:00.020 --> 2:02:02.020]  where there's a good percentage of the American
[2:02:02.020 --> 2:02:04.020]  population upset with the government
[2:02:04.020 --> 2:02:06.020]  demanding constitutional reform
[2:02:06.020 --> 2:02:08.020]  back to the original constitution
[2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:10.020]  precisely because
[2:02:10.020 --> 2:02:12.020]  the government has so
[2:02:12.020 --> 2:02:14.020]  arrogantly exceeded its authority
[2:02:14.020 --> 2:02:16.020]  that it now threatens the existence
[2:02:16.020 --> 2:02:18.020]  of a market upon which we all depend
[2:02:18.020 --> 2:02:20.020]  to live.
[2:02:20.020 --> 2:02:22.020]  And I think we're going to get there
[2:02:22.020 --> 2:02:24.020]  I just hope that we get there
[2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:26.020]  through the reforms that we're talking about
[2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:28.020]  through this Restore the Republic
[2:02:28.020 --> 2:02:30.020]  Movement rather than
[2:02:30.020 --> 2:02:32.020]  getting there as a result
[2:02:32.020 --> 2:02:34.020]  of the collapse of the government and the calamity
[2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:36.020]  that it will cause to the economy
[2:02:36.020 --> 2:02:38.020]  and the disruption and
[2:02:38.020 --> 2:02:40.020]  injury that will cause to so many
[2:02:40.020 --> 2:02:42.020]  people as a result of that derelict course.
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:44.020]  Let me ask you about the Commerce Clause
[2:02:44.020 --> 2:02:46.020]  I'm sure this is one of the key points
[2:02:46.020 --> 2:02:48.020]  of your platform, the Restore the Republic
[2:02:48.020 --> 2:02:50.020]  platform. Are you going to go after
[2:02:50.020 --> 2:02:52.020]  the Commerce Clause and the overreaching
[2:02:52.020 --> 2:02:54.020]  misinterpretation of that clause by
[2:02:54.020 --> 2:02:56.020]  the federal government which it uses as you well know
[2:02:56.020 --> 2:02:58.020]  to go after things like raw milk freedom?
[2:02:58.020 --> 2:03:00.020]  Right. The Commerce Clause
[2:03:00.020 --> 2:03:02.020]  was never intended to give government
[2:03:02.020 --> 2:03:04.020]  a free check in order to
[2:03:04.020 --> 2:03:06.020]  go into every single
[2:03:06.020 --> 2:03:08.020]  private domain and
[2:03:08.020 --> 2:03:10.020]  regulate it. But that's how the Congress of the
[2:03:10.020 --> 2:03:12.020]  United States is interpreted. Obamacare is a perfect
[2:03:12.020 --> 2:03:14.020]  example. The Commerce Clause was
[2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:16.020]  intended to prevent states
[2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:18.020]  from imposing barriers
[2:03:18.020 --> 2:03:20.020]  to free enterprise that would destroy
[2:03:20.020 --> 2:03:22.020]  the value of contract and
[2:03:22.020 --> 2:03:24.020]  disable the free enterprise system. That's why
[2:03:24.020 --> 2:03:26.020]  the Commerce Clause was created. It was created
[2:03:26.020 --> 2:03:28.020]  specifically to deal with the crisis that
[2:03:28.020 --> 2:03:30.020]  then existed in which some
[2:03:30.020 --> 2:03:32.020]  of the nation's states
[2:03:32.020 --> 2:03:34.020]  were imposing tariff barriers
[2:03:34.020 --> 2:03:36.020]  to prevent outside
[2:03:36.020 --> 2:03:38.020]  industry from getting into the states.
[2:03:38.020 --> 2:03:40.020]  It was never intended
[2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:42.020]  to give the federal government a power to
[2:03:42.020 --> 2:03:44.020]  take over all the operation of the states
[2:03:44.020 --> 2:03:46.020]  and to transform
[2:03:46.020 --> 2:03:48.020]  the individual into a servant
[2:03:48.020 --> 2:03:50.020]  of the federal government doing the government's
[2:03:50.020 --> 2:03:52.020]  bidding on public policy. This
[2:03:52.020 --> 2:03:54.020]  Obamacare is an unprecedented
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.020]  expansion of the government
[2:03:56.020 --> 2:03:58.020]  that will enable the federal government to impose
[2:03:58.020 --> 2:04:00.020]  individual mandates outside of this area
[2:04:00.020 --> 2:04:02.020]  with impunity, compelling people to
[2:04:02.020 --> 2:04:04.020]  buy electric cars or do whatever the government
[2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:06.020]  wants in order to pursue
[2:04:06.020 --> 2:04:08.020]  some federal objective. It is
[2:04:08.020 --> 2:04:10.020]  the ultimate in the deprivation of
[2:04:10.020 --> 2:04:12.020]  individual liberty and property. They could come along
[2:04:12.020 --> 2:04:14.020]  and order you to buy vaccines
[2:04:14.020 --> 2:04:16.020]  whether you need them or not. They could order
[2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:18.020]  you to buy, you mentioned electric cars,
[2:04:18.020 --> 2:04:20.020]  they could order you to buy pesticides or GMOs.
[2:04:20.020 --> 2:04:22.020]  I mean they could just demand it.
[2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:24.020]  We're talking about a command economy, top
[2:04:24.020 --> 2:04:26.020]  down communist style
[2:04:26.020 --> 2:04:28.020]  centralized economy. That's what Obamacare
[2:04:28.020 --> 2:04:30.020]  really represents. Right.
[2:04:30.020 --> 2:04:32.020]  The essence of the Obama administration
[2:04:32.020 --> 2:04:34.020]  is that it's distrust.
[2:04:34.020 --> 2:04:36.020]  It's distrust of the American people
[2:04:36.020 --> 2:04:38.020]  and we have to restore individual sovereignty
[2:04:38.020 --> 2:04:40.020]  in order for this nation to be great again.
[2:04:40.020 --> 2:04:42.020]  All right. Thank you, Jonathan, for joining us
[2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:44.020]  today. I really appreciate your time and your effort,
[2:04:44.020 --> 2:04:46.020]  your courage as an American. Thank you very much.
[2:04:46.020 --> 2:04:48.020]  Thank you so much, Mike. All right, stay with us, folks.
[2:04:48.020 --> 2:04:50.020]  We'll be right back after this break
[2:04:50.020 --> 2:04:52.020]  with Liz Reitzig and
[2:04:52.020 --> 2:04:54.020]  some information on Raw Milk Freedom, plus some other
[2:04:54.020 --> 2:04:56.020]  breaking news straight ahead. This is the Alex Jones
[2:04:56.020 --> 2:05:06.020]  show. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[2:05:26.020 --> 2:05:30.020]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[2:05:30.020 --> 2:05:32.020]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[2:05:32.020 --> 2:05:34.020]  where you need it most.
[2:05:34.020 --> 2:05:36.020]  Blue diamond gussets
[2:05:36.020 --> 2:05:38.020]  got it.
[2:05:38.020 --> 2:05:40.020]  Other stone.
[2:05:40.020 --> 2:05:42.020]  We turned jeans inside out.
[2:05:42.020 --> 2:05:44.020]  Diamond gusset jeans
[2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:46.020]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[2:05:46.020 --> 2:05:48.020]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans
[2:05:48.020 --> 2:05:50.020]  combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[2:05:50.020 --> 2:05:52.020]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[2:05:52.020 --> 2:05:54.020]  Order yours at
[2:05:54.020 --> 2:05:56.020]  gusset.com.
[2:05:56.020 --> 2:05:58.020]  Diamond gusset jeans
[2:05:58.020 --> 2:06:00.020]  got it. Others don't.
[2:06:00.020 --> 2:06:02.020]  A little over a year ago,
[2:06:02.020 --> 2:06:04.020]  I began to do a lot of research
[2:06:04.020 --> 2:06:06.020]  into why, even if I had a pretty good
[2:06:06.020 --> 2:06:08.020]  size meal, that I was still starving.
[2:06:08.020 --> 2:06:10.020]  And my research led me to a well-known
[2:06:10.020 --> 2:06:12.020]  fact that most of the soils
[2:06:12.020 --> 2:06:14.020]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[2:06:14.020 --> 2:06:16.020]  and across the industrialized world
[2:06:16.020 --> 2:06:18.020]  are almost completely depleted
[2:06:18.020 --> 2:06:20.020]  of almost all of the key minerals
[2:06:20.020 --> 2:06:22.020]  and trace elements that our bodies
[2:06:22.020 --> 2:06:24.020]  need to rebuild themselves,
[2:06:24.020 --> 2:06:26.020]  fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[2:06:26.020 --> 2:06:28.020]  I then searched out the best
[2:06:28.020 --> 2:06:30.020]  vitamin and mineral company out there
[2:06:30.020 --> 2:06:32.020]  and discovered Young Jevity.
[2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:34.020]  The Young Jevity products are designed
[2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:36.020]  to give you the real nutrition you need
[2:06:36.020 --> 2:06:38.020]  and once you've got that, you don't
[2:06:38.020 --> 2:06:40.020]  have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:42.020]  I've lost 37 pounds
[2:06:42.020 --> 2:06:44.020]  in two months.
[2:06:44.020 --> 2:06:46.020]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[2:06:46.020 --> 2:06:48.020]  Check it out for yourself.
[2:06:48.020 --> 2:06:50.020]  It's incredible. Go to
[2:06:50.020 --> 2:06:52.020]  www.team.com today
[2:06:52.020 --> 2:06:54.020]  and order your first canister of
[2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:56.020]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[2:06:56.020 --> 2:06:58.020]  Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex
[2:06:58.020 --> 2:07:00.020]  Dietary Supplement. That's
[2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:02.020]  InfowarsTeam.com
[2:07:02.020 --> 2:07:04.020]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[2:07:04.020 --> 2:07:06.020]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:07:06.020 --> 2:07:08.020]  Number one, new climate legislation
[2:07:08.020 --> 2:07:10.020]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:07:10.020 --> 2:07:12.020]  Number two, our new energy czar
[2:07:12.020 --> 2:07:14.020]  wants to control how much power
[2:07:14.020 --> 2:07:16.020]  your electric company allows you to have.
[2:07:16.020 --> 2:07:18.020]  It's true, total government control
[2:07:18.020 --> 2:07:20.020]  in the name of smart grid technology
[2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:22.020]  is coming. Number three, in
[2:07:22.020 --> 2:07:24.020]  some areas of the country, the power grid
[2:07:24.020 --> 2:07:26.020]  is dangerously overloaded. And now
[2:07:26.020 --> 2:07:28.020]  new socialist legislation is only
[2:07:28.020 --> 2:07:30.020]  compounding the problem. Number four,
[2:07:30.020 --> 2:07:32.020]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[2:07:32.020 --> 2:07:34.020]  grids. Every year, thousands of
[2:07:34.020 --> 2:07:36.020]  families lose their power from weather-related
[2:07:36.020 --> 2:07:38.020]  onages. Number five, a solar power
[2:07:38.020 --> 2:07:40.020]  generator provides powerful backup
[2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:42.020]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really
[2:07:42.020 --> 2:07:44.020]  believe in the solar power generators offered
[2:07:44.020 --> 2:07:46.020]  by Solutions from Science, one of my old
[2:07:46.020 --> 2:07:48.020]  sponsors. You can get more information
[2:07:48.020 --> 2:07:50.020]  at www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:07:50.020 --> 2:07:52.020]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:07:52.020 --> 2:07:54.020]  Remember, the government doesn't own
[2:07:54.020 --> 2:07:56.020]  the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:07:56.020 --> 2:07:58.020]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:08:02.020 --> 2:08:04.020]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:08:04.020 --> 2:08:06.020]  Alex Jones on the GCN
[2:08:06.020 --> 2:08:08.020]  Radio Network.
[2:08:10.020 --> 2:08:12.020]  That was a fascinating segment with
[2:08:12.020 --> 2:08:14.020]  Attorney Jonathan E. Moore,
[2:08:14.020 --> 2:08:16.020]  Restore the Republic. And I really
[2:08:16.020 --> 2:08:18.020]  want to encourage all Infowars listeners
[2:08:18.020 --> 2:08:20.020]  to check out his website
[2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:22.020]  emord.com. That's E-M-O-R-D.
[2:08:24.020 --> 2:08:26.020]  And to sign up for his email newsletter,
[2:08:26.020 --> 2:08:28.020]  which I'm going to talk to him after the show
[2:08:28.020 --> 2:08:30.020]  and see if we can help support that newsletter
[2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:32.020]  in some other ways. I think Jonathan
[2:08:32.020 --> 2:08:34.020]  E. Moore is truly one of the
[2:08:34.020 --> 2:08:36.020]  most important patriots and voices
[2:08:36.020 --> 2:08:38.020]  for the future of our Republic.
[2:08:38.020 --> 2:08:40.020]  And no wonder that Ron
[2:08:40.020 --> 2:08:42.020]  Paul was willing to write the intro for his
[2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:44.020]  campaign. And no wonder
[2:08:44.020 --> 2:08:46.020]  Jonathan E. Moore's reputation is so strong
[2:08:46.020 --> 2:08:48.020]  around the country. And so we'll cover him
[2:08:48.020 --> 2:08:50.020]  on natural news and I'm sure Alex will want
[2:08:50.020 --> 2:08:52.020]  to talk to him here on Infowars as well.
[2:08:52.020 --> 2:08:54.020]  Look, we are in so much trouble
[2:08:54.020 --> 2:08:56.020]  if we don't take serious action
[2:08:56.020 --> 2:08:58.020]  now
[2:08:58.020 --> 2:09:00.020]  and band together, those of us who
[2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:02.020]  understand history, who understand
[2:09:02.020 --> 2:09:04.020]  liberty, who understand the fundamentals
[2:09:04.020 --> 2:09:06.020]  of the distribution of power,
[2:09:06.020 --> 2:09:08.020]  who understand basic Austrian economics,
[2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.020]  for example. Lou Rockwell has been a frequent
[2:09:10.020 --> 2:09:12.020]  actor on the show. On the show.
[2:09:12.020 --> 2:09:14.020]  If those of us who
[2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:16.020]  understand these concepts don't band
[2:09:16.020 --> 2:09:18.020]  together and really take action,
[2:09:18.020 --> 2:09:20.020]  we will lose this country. We will lose
[2:09:20.020 --> 2:09:22.020]  this Republic. We will end up
[2:09:22.020 --> 2:09:24.020]  as a total enslavement,
[2:09:24.020 --> 2:09:26.020]  FEMA camp, maybe
[2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:28.020]  as Max Kaiser says, cranking up the
[2:09:28.020 --> 2:09:30.020]  incinerators and having trains of people
[2:09:30.020 --> 2:09:32.020]  in the incinerator camps. I mean, Nazi
[2:09:32.020 --> 2:09:34.020]  style holocaust. I'm not saying
[2:09:34.020 --> 2:09:36.020]  that I don't want to paint a doomsday
[2:09:36.020 --> 2:09:38.020]  picture, but that has happened in history.
[2:09:38.020 --> 2:09:40.020]  And it
[2:09:40.020 --> 2:09:42.020]  happened using the exact same processes
[2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:44.020]  that we are going through right now, the disarmament
[2:09:44.020 --> 2:09:46.020]  and then the grabbing of federal power
[2:09:46.020 --> 2:09:48.020]  and then the enslavement of the people.
[2:09:48.020 --> 2:09:50.020]  Holocaust is the natural step
[2:09:50.020 --> 2:09:52.020]  that happens right after that. So we want
[2:09:52.020 --> 2:09:54.020]  to prevent that. We want peace. We want health.
[2:09:54.020 --> 2:09:56.020]  We want abundance. We want entrepreneurship.
[2:09:56.020 --> 2:09:58.020]  We want a strong, healthy economy. And that's
[2:09:58.020 --> 2:10:00.020]  why we've got a band together on this.
[2:10:00.020 --> 2:10:02.020]  Now, we're going to be joined here in this segment
[2:10:02.020 --> 2:10:04.020]  by Liz Reitzig. She
[2:10:04.020 --> 2:10:06.020]  is, of course, one of the most prominent
[2:10:06.020 --> 2:10:08.020]  voices in the raw milk
[2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:10.020]  and food freedom industries
[2:10:10.020 --> 2:10:12.020]  or worlds, realms.
[2:10:12.020 --> 2:10:14.020]  And she's got a very important
[2:10:14.020 --> 2:10:16.020]  announcement for us today that I want to get behind
[2:10:16.020 --> 2:10:18.020]  and help spread the word on there's a rally
[2:10:18.020 --> 2:10:20.020]  happening this Friday. She will give you the
[2:10:20.020 --> 2:10:22.020]  details on that. Let's bring her
[2:10:22.020 --> 2:10:24.020]  on right now for that news.
[2:10:24.020 --> 2:10:26.020]  Liz, are you with us? Hi Mike.
[2:10:26.020 --> 2:10:28.020]  Here I am. Hi there, Liz.
[2:10:28.020 --> 2:10:30.020]  Great to have you on the Alice Jones
[2:10:30.020 --> 2:10:32.020]  show. Tell us about
[2:10:32.020 --> 2:10:34.020]  this rally. Well, thanks
[2:10:34.020 --> 2:10:36.020]  so much for having me on. And yeah,
[2:10:36.020 --> 2:10:38.020]  just a little bit about the rally on Friday.
[2:10:38.020 --> 2:10:40.020]  It's in support of farmer Vernon
[2:10:40.020 --> 2:10:42.020]  Hirschberger.
[2:10:42.020 --> 2:10:44.020]  And he is a Wisconsin dairy farmer
[2:10:44.020 --> 2:10:46.020]  who has been targeted by the state.
[2:10:46.020 --> 2:10:48.020]  It's the Department of Agriculture, Trade
[2:10:48.020 --> 2:10:50.020]  and Consumer Protection.
[2:10:50.020 --> 2:10:52.020]  And they've gone after him
[2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:54.020]  for not having certain licenses.
[2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:56.020]  And all he's doing is
[2:10:56.020 --> 2:10:58.020]  providing good, wholesome, clean
[2:10:58.020 --> 2:11:00.020]  foods to his community.
[2:11:00.020 --> 2:11:02.020]  And so he has a hearing coming up
[2:11:02.020 --> 2:11:04.020]  this Friday in Salk County
[2:11:04.020 --> 2:11:06.020]  at the Baraboo Courthouse.
[2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:08.020]  All right, let me spell some of those words.
[2:11:08.020 --> 2:11:10.020]  Salk County is S-A-U-K
[2:11:10.020 --> 2:11:12.020]  Salk County and Baraboo Wisconsin
[2:11:12.020 --> 2:11:14.020]  is B-A-R-A-B-O-O
[2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:16.020]  just kind of like it sounds. Yes, that's
[2:11:16.020 --> 2:11:18.020]  correct. And so we're just
[2:11:18.020 --> 2:11:20.020]  a lot of supporters are just getting
[2:11:20.020 --> 2:11:22.020]  behind him and rallying with him
[2:11:22.020 --> 2:11:24.020]  and standing with him as he takes
[2:11:24.020 --> 2:11:26.020]  a very strong stand
[2:11:26.020 --> 2:11:28.020]  for our food freedoms. All right.
[2:11:28.020 --> 2:11:30.020]  So we need info warriors out there.
[2:11:30.020 --> 2:11:32.020]  Also cities to Baraboo, Wisconsin
[2:11:32.020 --> 2:11:34.020]  within driving distance where they could attend.
[2:11:34.020 --> 2:11:36.020]  Madison is very close.
[2:11:36.020 --> 2:11:38.020]  Well, relatively speaking, it's about
[2:11:38.020 --> 2:11:40.020]  an hour and a half away and Chicago
[2:11:40.020 --> 2:11:42.020]  was about two hours away. But people are flying
[2:11:42.020 --> 2:11:44.020]  in from all over the country for this
[2:11:44.020 --> 2:11:46.020]  and we're going to have some really strong
[2:11:46.020 --> 2:11:48.020]  announcements, including we're unveiling
[2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:50.020]  and reading and signing
[2:11:50.020 --> 2:11:52.020]  a declaration of food independence
[2:11:52.020 --> 2:11:54.020]  at the rally. Okay. Wow.
[2:11:54.020 --> 2:11:56.020]  I heard some buzz about that. The declaration
[2:11:56.020 --> 2:11:58.020]  of food independence, obviously
[2:11:58.020 --> 2:12:00.020]  of historical echoes
[2:12:00.020 --> 2:12:02.020]  and ramifications there. Do you have any details
[2:12:02.020 --> 2:12:04.020]  on that or is that going to be unveiled on the day?
[2:12:04.020 --> 2:12:06.020]  It's going to be unveiled on the
[2:12:06.020 --> 2:12:08.020]  day and we will be live streaming it.
[2:12:08.020 --> 2:12:10.020]  So if anybody wants to tune in, they can.
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:12.020]  Well, I can imagine what it's going
[2:12:12.020 --> 2:12:14.020]  to say. I mean, you know, we
[2:12:14.020 --> 2:12:16.020]  have a natural God given right to grow
[2:12:16.020 --> 2:12:18.020]  our own food to milk a cow
[2:12:18.020 --> 2:12:20.020]  to share food with neighbors or barter
[2:12:20.020 --> 2:12:22.020]  food with neighbors and the government has no
[2:12:22.020 --> 2:12:24.020]  right to tell us what we can and cannot
[2:12:24.020 --> 2:12:26.020]  eat, especially when it's natural food right off
[2:12:26.020 --> 2:12:28.020]  our own farms and ranches, right?
[2:12:28.020 --> 2:12:30.020]  Right. That's correct. And
[2:12:30.020 --> 2:12:32.020]  you know, we go a little further and we say
[2:12:32.020 --> 2:12:34.020]  we even have a right to engage
[2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:36.020]  in mutually consenting arrangements
[2:12:36.020 --> 2:12:38.020]  for our food. So oh my gosh,
[2:12:38.020 --> 2:12:40.020]  trade, you mean, how dare you
[2:12:40.020 --> 2:12:42.020]  think that we that the slaves can trade?
[2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:44.020]  Right. Exactly.
[2:12:44.020 --> 2:12:46.020]  So it would be if you're a producer, I'm
[2:12:46.020 --> 2:12:48.020]  a consumer, we have that right as long
[2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:50.020]  as we're both agreeable.
[2:12:50.020 --> 2:12:52.020]  Liz, give us some background on Vernon
[2:12:52.020 --> 2:12:54.020]  Hirschberger, who is being
[2:12:54.020 --> 2:12:56.020]  targeted for
[2:12:56.020 --> 2:12:58.020]  this oppression.
[2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:00.020]  What's the background on Vernon?
[2:13:00.020 --> 2:13:02.020]  Well, basically, he has a private buying
[2:13:02.020 --> 2:13:04.020]  group. So he's got some members of his
[2:13:04.020 --> 2:13:06.020]  community that
[2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:08.020]  his farm supplies food for.
[2:13:08.020 --> 2:13:10.020]  Now, they're all kind of co-owners in the
[2:13:10.020 --> 2:13:12.020]  farm. So it's a private buying club
[2:13:12.020 --> 2:13:14.020]  and he distributes
[2:13:14.020 --> 2:13:16.020]  from his farm.
[2:13:16.020 --> 2:13:18.020]  And this about
[2:13:18.020 --> 2:13:20.020]  a year ago, the state came in and
[2:13:20.020 --> 2:13:22.020]  because he did not have
[2:13:22.020 --> 2:13:24.020]  a retail food establishment license,
[2:13:24.020 --> 2:13:26.020]  they came on to his farm
[2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:28.020]  and they taped all his coolers shut.
[2:13:28.020 --> 2:13:30.020]  And Vernon,
[2:13:30.020 --> 2:13:32.020]  he cut that
[2:13:32.020 --> 2:13:34.020]  tape and he said,
[2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:36.020]  I'm open. Come and get your food.
[2:13:36.020 --> 2:13:38.020]  Right. That's cutting through the red tape,
[2:13:38.020 --> 2:13:40.020]  literally. Exactly.
[2:13:40.020 --> 2:13:42.020]  So he's now he's got
[2:13:42.020 --> 2:13:44.020]  ongoing court proceedings
[2:13:44.020 --> 2:13:46.020]  to deal with that issue and some other
[2:13:46.020 --> 2:13:48.020]  just licensure issues. So
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:50.020]  he's got the
[2:13:50.020 --> 2:13:52.020]  that he's operating a real retail food
[2:13:52.020 --> 2:13:54.020]  establishment without a license. He's got
[2:13:54.020 --> 2:13:56.020]  that charge against him and operating
[2:13:56.020 --> 2:13:58.020]  a dairy plant without a license
[2:13:58.020 --> 2:14:00.020]  and operating
[2:14:00.020 --> 2:14:02.020]  a milk
[2:14:02.020 --> 2:14:04.020]  establishment, something like that without a license.
[2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:06.020]  But again, Liz, there's no the consumers
[2:14:06.020 --> 2:14:08.020]  were in no way misled. They
[2:14:08.020 --> 2:14:10.020]  knew they were buying raw fresh dairy.
[2:14:10.020 --> 2:14:12.020]  They know there are always
[2:14:12.020 --> 2:14:14.020]  inherent risks in something that is raw.
[2:14:14.020 --> 2:14:16.020]  They're actually more risk
[2:14:16.020 --> 2:14:18.020]  for processed dead homogenized milk, but
[2:14:18.020 --> 2:14:20.020]  that's a whole different story. I mean, it's not like consumers
[2:14:20.020 --> 2:14:22.020]  were being misled in any way, correct?
[2:14:22.020 --> 2:14:24.020]  Oh, that's absolutely correct. Right. And it goes
[2:14:24.020 --> 2:14:26.020]  even further than that. All of these consumers
[2:14:26.020 --> 2:14:28.020]  are active participants
[2:14:28.020 --> 2:14:30.020]  in the production of their food.
[2:14:30.020 --> 2:14:32.020]  Right. Yeah.
[2:14:32.020 --> 2:14:34.020]  And then here comes the DAC cap.
[2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:36.020]  That's the Department of Agriculture
[2:14:36.020 --> 2:14:38.020]  Trade and Consumer Protection
[2:14:38.020 --> 2:14:40.020]  and they're telling people they can't have
[2:14:40.020 --> 2:14:42.020]  their own food. So there's
[2:14:42.020 --> 2:14:44.020]  a new story posted today.
[2:14:44.020 --> 2:14:46.020]  I think this is on Info Wars as well. Harvard
[2:14:46.020 --> 2:14:48.020]  study pasteurized milk from industrial
[2:14:48.020 --> 2:14:50.020]  dairies has been linked to cancer.
[2:14:50.020 --> 2:14:52.020]  Scientific evidence
[2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:54.020]  shows that again, conventional pasteurized
[2:14:54.020 --> 2:14:56.020]  milk contains up to 33
[2:14:56.020 --> 2:14:58.020]  times more estrone sulfate
[2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:00.020]  which
[2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:02.020]  causes cancer.
[2:15:02.020 --> 2:15:04.020]  How come they don't talk about the dangers of
[2:15:04.020 --> 2:15:06.020]  pasteurized milk? They always talk about the dangers
[2:15:06.020 --> 2:15:08.020]  of raw or fresh milk as if
[2:15:08.020 --> 2:15:10.020]  that's like alkyda milk
[2:15:10.020 --> 2:15:12.020]  or something. It's terrorism
[2:15:12.020 --> 2:15:14.020]  to drink fresh milk. Right. And you know the fresh
[2:15:14.020 --> 2:15:16.020]  milk just every once in a while
[2:15:16.020 --> 2:15:18.020]  spontaneously explodes.
[2:15:18.020 --> 2:15:20.020]  Yeah. Right. Little milk bombs.
[2:15:20.020 --> 2:15:22.020]  Be careful of it.
[2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:24.020]  But seriously though,
[2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:26.020]  there's more and more information coming out
[2:15:26.020 --> 2:15:28.020]  just about pasteurized milk
[2:15:28.020 --> 2:15:30.020]  and what's in it and why it is a problem
[2:15:30.020 --> 2:15:32.020]  and
[2:15:32.020 --> 2:15:34.020]  the CDC information
[2:15:34.020 --> 2:15:36.020]  lists pasteurized milk
[2:15:36.020 --> 2:15:38.020]  and lists the illnesses
[2:15:38.020 --> 2:15:40.020]  and outbreaks that occur with it
[2:15:40.020 --> 2:15:42.020]  and that it's one of the most
[2:15:42.020 --> 2:15:44.020]  allergenic foods in America.
[2:15:44.020 --> 2:15:46.020]  Okay, Liz, let's get some websites
[2:15:46.020 --> 2:15:48.020]  out to people who want to participate
[2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:50.020]  in this event. Where do they go to get information?
[2:15:50.020 --> 2:15:52.020]  They can go to rawmilkfreedomriders.com
[2:15:54.020 --> 2:15:56.020]  Okay, rawmilkfreedomriders.com
[2:15:56.020 --> 2:15:58.020]  See if you can bring that up guys. Is there any other
[2:15:58.020 --> 2:16:00.020]  website?
[2:16:00.020 --> 2:16:02.020]  The Farm Food Freedom Coalition
[2:16:02.020 --> 2:16:04.020]  which is farmfoodfreedom.org
[2:16:04.020 --> 2:16:06.020]  that's the sponsoring organization.
[2:16:06.020 --> 2:16:08.020]  All right. And then of course
[2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:10.020]  the Westinay Price Foundation
[2:16:10.020 --> 2:16:12.020]  which is westinayprice.org
[2:16:12.020 --> 2:16:14.020]  and that's a really good resource for
[2:16:14.020 --> 2:16:16.020]  nutritional information including benefits
[2:16:16.020 --> 2:16:18.020]  of real milk.
[2:16:18.020 --> 2:16:20.020]  Now, this has been going on
[2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:22.020]  for quite a long time in America
[2:16:22.020 --> 2:16:24.020]  now where the government
[2:16:24.020 --> 2:16:26.020]  is bringing guns
[2:16:26.020 --> 2:16:28.020]  to these food operations
[2:16:28.020 --> 2:16:30.020]  like we saw with the Raw Subfood Raids
[2:16:30.020 --> 2:16:32.020]  and the government is destroying the food
[2:16:32.020 --> 2:16:34.020]  and the government is intimidating farmers
[2:16:34.020 --> 2:16:36.020]  and destroying picnics and making them destroy their food
[2:16:36.020 --> 2:16:38.020]  and they've gone after Vern and Hirschberger here
[2:16:38.020 --> 2:16:40.020]  and they've arrested the Amish farmers.
[2:16:40.020 --> 2:16:42.020]  How long do you think
[2:16:42.020 --> 2:16:44.020]  this is going to continue to go on
[2:16:44.020 --> 2:16:46.020]  before the American people say enough is enough?
[2:16:46.020 --> 2:16:48.020]  You know, we're not putting up with this anymore.
[2:16:48.020 --> 2:16:50.020]  We're going to fight back
[2:16:50.020 --> 2:16:52.020]  or sue the government or something.
[2:16:52.020 --> 2:16:54.020]  Well, I sincerely hope
[2:16:54.020 --> 2:16:56.020]  it's not much longer. My farmer
[2:16:56.020 --> 2:16:58.020]  that I relied on for a lot of my food
[2:16:58.020 --> 2:17:00.020]  he just got shut down by the FDA
[2:17:00.020 --> 2:17:02.020]  and it's just
[2:17:02.020 --> 2:17:04.020]  devastating, it's horribly upsetting
[2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:06.020]  and I hope that
[2:17:06.020 --> 2:17:08.020]  with the consequences like that
[2:17:08.020 --> 2:17:10.020]  people begin to stand up and say
[2:17:10.020 --> 2:17:12.020]  enough is enough and we must do something
[2:17:12.020 --> 2:17:14.020]  and it's not going to be
[2:17:14.020 --> 2:17:16.020]  just farmers because there just
[2:17:16.020 --> 2:17:18.020]  are not enough farmers left in this country
[2:17:18.020 --> 2:17:20.020]  for just their voices to be loud enough
[2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:22.020]  so it has to be consumers
[2:17:22.020 --> 2:17:24.020]  even consumers who aren't dedicated
[2:17:24.020 --> 2:17:26.020]  to choosing farm fresh foods
[2:17:26.020 --> 2:17:28.020]  maybe they just want to eat cereal
[2:17:28.020 --> 2:17:30.020]  and soda all day long but they still
[2:17:30.020 --> 2:17:32.020]  want to eat what they want to eat
[2:17:32.020 --> 2:17:34.020]  not what a small
[2:17:34.020 --> 2:17:36.020]  population tells them they can eat.
[2:17:36.020 --> 2:17:38.020]  Well, there's even more to it than that.
[2:17:38.020 --> 2:17:40.020]  Do you realize this listeners
[2:17:40.020 --> 2:17:42.020]  that they're trying to literally kill you?
[2:17:42.020 --> 2:17:44.020]  They don't want you to eat farm fresh food
[2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:46.020]  so they're going to outlaw all of that
[2:17:46.020 --> 2:17:48.020]  and call you a criminal and call you a terrorist
[2:17:48.020 --> 2:17:50.020]  if you engage in trading fresh milk
[2:17:50.020 --> 2:17:52.020]  but what you're supposed to eat is the GMO
[2:17:52.020 --> 2:17:54.020]  you're supposed to eat the pesticides
[2:17:54.020 --> 2:17:56.020]  you're supposed to eat the foods
[2:17:56.020 --> 2:17:58.020]  that are laced with chemicals that will destroy your gut
[2:17:58.020 --> 2:18:00.020]  and cause immunological disorders
[2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:02.020]  and cause obesity and cause cancer
[2:18:02.020 --> 2:18:04.020]  I mean that's, it's an agenda
[2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:06.020]  I'm telling you Liz, it's an agenda
[2:18:06.020 --> 2:18:08.020]  to outlaw real food and kill the American consumers.
[2:18:08.020 --> 2:18:10.020]  It is, it's upside down
[2:18:10.020 --> 2:18:12.020]  and backwards and I have
[2:18:12.020 --> 2:18:14.020]  five small children
[2:18:14.020 --> 2:18:16.020]  and I can feed them fast food
[2:18:16.020 --> 2:18:18.020]  three times a day or
[2:18:18.020 --> 2:18:20.020]  soda and lollipops all day long
[2:18:20.020 --> 2:18:22.020]  but as soon as I go to Pennsylvania
[2:18:22.020 --> 2:18:24.020]  and get a gallon of milk and bring it home for them
[2:18:24.020 --> 2:18:26.020]  I'm a criminal. Oh yeah, if you want to feed your kids
[2:18:26.020 --> 2:18:28.020]  Aspartame and MSG and high fructose corn syrup
[2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:30.020]  no problem, the government approves of all that
[2:18:30.020 --> 2:18:32.020]  yeah, because the lobbies are in there
[2:18:32.020 --> 2:18:34.020]  telling them it's all okay, no problem
[2:18:34.020 --> 2:18:36.020]  but if you want actual living food
[2:18:36.020 --> 2:18:38.020]  fresh milk, raw juice, sprouts
[2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:40.020]  all these things they say
[2:18:40.020 --> 2:18:42.020]  it's terrible, so dangerous, so dangerous
[2:18:42.020 --> 2:18:44.020]  the CDC has put out a bunch of propaganda
[2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:46.020]  about raw milk being dangerous
[2:18:46.020 --> 2:18:48.020]  and we fought back against that with an article
[2:18:48.020 --> 2:18:50.020]  that said pasteurized milk is 150 times
[2:18:50.020 --> 2:18:52.020]  more filthy than raw milk
[2:18:52.020 --> 2:18:54.020]  Saw that, that was really great
[2:18:54.020 --> 2:18:56.020]  Yeah, what else do people
[2:18:56.020 --> 2:18:58.020]  need to know about this issue?
[2:18:58.020 --> 2:19:00.020]  It just needs to be a consumer uprising
[2:19:00.020 --> 2:19:02.020]  and consumer support of these farmers
[2:19:02.020 --> 2:19:04.020]  and that we've got to stand
[2:19:04.020 --> 2:19:06.020]  with the farmers who are willing to stand up
[2:19:06.020 --> 2:19:10.020]  and keep going despite whatever threats they get
[2:19:10.020 --> 2:19:12.020]  and that's Vernon right now and he's doing it
[2:19:12.020 --> 2:19:14.020]  so we've got to stand with him
[2:19:14.020 --> 2:19:16.020]  if anybody anywhere can do this
[2:19:16.020 --> 2:19:18.020]  they can come to the courthouse
[2:19:18.020 --> 2:19:20.020]  they can participate in some way
[2:19:20.020 --> 2:19:22.020]  we've also got a rights workshop
[2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:24.020]  that we're hosting the day before
[2:19:24.020 --> 2:19:26.020]  so that people can just really be aware
[2:19:26.020 --> 2:19:28.020]  of their fundamental rights
[2:19:28.020 --> 2:19:30.020]  and realize how many other people
[2:19:30.020 --> 2:19:32.020]  are with them on this
[2:19:32.020 --> 2:19:34.020]  we're not isolated
[2:19:34.020 --> 2:19:36.020]  Liz, I want you to stay with us for quite a while longer
[2:19:36.020 --> 2:19:38.020]  I've got a lot of questions for you
[2:19:38.020 --> 2:19:40.020]  and maybe we can get some callers on board
[2:19:40.020 --> 2:19:42.020]  to ask you some questions if you're open to that
[2:19:42.020 --> 2:19:44.020]  you are listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:19:44.020 --> 2:19:46.020]  and an interview with Liz Wright-Zig

[2:24:08.980 --> 2:24:13.180]  New research has come out of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
[2:24:13.180 --> 2:24:17.580]  It was led by virologist Peter Palasse.
[2:24:17.580 --> 2:24:23.420]  And it reveals that the World Health Organization has been greatly exaggerating the fatality
[2:24:23.420 --> 2:24:26.180]  rate of bird flu.
[2:24:26.180 --> 2:24:31.860]  Now what does that have to do with the segment here? We're talking with Lysig about raw milk.
[2:24:31.860 --> 2:24:35.660]  And you know, government tries to say that raw milk or fresh milk is so dangerous and
[2:24:35.660 --> 2:24:40.100]  deadly for you. Well, these government institutions say that all the time. They use fear-mongering
[2:24:40.100 --> 2:24:44.620]  to scare you into compliance on their medical agenda or their food agenda or their just
[2:24:44.620 --> 2:24:46.380]  total enslavement agenda.
[2:24:46.380 --> 2:24:55.060]  It turns out that the WHO, World Health Organization, says about 50 to 59% of the people who get
[2:24:55.060 --> 2:25:00.180]  infected by bird flu die. It turns out it's only 1% according to this new study.
[2:25:00.180 --> 2:25:09.660]  That's 1%. Yeah, well, I mean, how else can they scare people into a stage six pandemic
[2:25:09.660 --> 2:25:14.020]  if they don't spread a bunch of fear stories? And of course, they're spreading fear stories
[2:25:14.020 --> 2:25:15.020]  about milk.
[2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:16.940]  So, Lys, are you still with us there?
[2:25:16.940 --> 2:25:17.940]  Yes, hi, Mike.
[2:25:17.940 --> 2:25:22.580]  All right, good to have you on. What do you make of all this fear-mongering about milk?
[2:25:22.580 --> 2:25:26.380]  What could possibly be in the minds of these government agents who are trying to scare us
[2:25:26.380 --> 2:25:28.260]  to death about drinking milk?
[2:25:28.260 --> 2:25:35.140]  Well, you know, it's an old paradigm. And there's a lot of new research coming out.
[2:25:35.140 --> 2:25:40.740]  Like, a lot of the research they're looking at is 50 to 100 years old. And that's when
[2:25:40.740 --> 2:25:45.700]  the raw milk was coming from distillery dairies. So, there was a problem at the turn of the
[2:25:45.700 --> 2:25:51.500]  century when there was no clothes milking systems. There was distillery dairies, which
[2:25:51.500 --> 2:25:55.740]  means the dairies were actually in the distilleries or right next to the distilleries and the
[2:25:55.740 --> 2:25:58.220]  cows were fed the slot from them.
[2:25:58.220 --> 2:26:05.620]  And then there was no refrigeration or cold trucking or clothes milking systems. And there
[2:26:05.620 --> 2:26:10.860]  was not good sanitation in the cities. So, there was a problem with the production methods
[2:26:10.860 --> 2:26:14.580]  and with the actual product, you know, 150 years ago.
[2:26:14.580 --> 2:26:17.420]  Right. Well, just like there was a problem with raw sewage flowing down the streets
[2:26:17.420 --> 2:26:21.860]  and people getting cholera and dysentery from unsanitary conditions. But that's over
[2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:27.500]  now. I mean, you know, people flush their toilets and it goes into, you know.
[2:26:27.500 --> 2:26:32.780]  And so, it is true that there is the occasional illness associated with raw milk. And, you
[2:26:32.780 --> 2:26:37.260]  know, that's like any food ever. And the only way to prevent that is just to stop eating
[2:26:37.260 --> 2:26:42.260]  and then you have other things to worry about. But this idea that somehow raw milk is inherently
[2:26:42.260 --> 2:26:47.140]  dangerous or that it's so much more dangerous than anything else, that is just fear mongering.
[2:26:47.140 --> 2:26:50.780]  Yeah, yeah, of course it is. But it's fear mongering that's very manipulative. It has
[2:26:50.780 --> 2:26:57.420]  a specific agenda to scare people into compliance. You know, fear, classic Hegelian dialectic
[2:26:57.420 --> 2:27:02.820]  right? A problem reaction solution, problem being raw milk. They say it's dangerous.
[2:27:02.820 --> 2:27:06.900]  Reaction, people say clamp down on raw milk. Solution is the processed milk industry gets
[2:27:06.900 --> 2:27:09.980]  all the money and has a monopoly. That's the whole system.
[2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:14.540]  Right. Or the legalization and tight control of raw milk.
[2:27:14.540 --> 2:27:19.780]  Yeah, I guess the regulation of it. We have the tight control and the regulators
[2:27:19.780 --> 2:27:25.380]  are telling producers how to produce it and they have to dot every I and cross every T.
[2:27:25.380 --> 2:27:28.060]  Then if they don't, then they're criminals for that.
[2:27:28.060 --> 2:27:31.340]  You know, I think most people don't realize if they visit a raw milk dairy, it is the
[2:27:31.340 --> 2:27:37.300]  cleanest dairy operation you will ever visit versus a typical corporate run conventional
[2:27:37.300 --> 2:27:43.900]  pasteurized homogenized milk dairy operation. It's filthy. It's blood, it's pus, it's feces
[2:27:43.900 --> 2:27:48.940]  going into the milk. In fact, there are allowed levels of all these things in pasteurized
[2:27:48.940 --> 2:27:53.500]  milk, which the government says is safe because they pasteurize it. So you're drinking pus
[2:27:53.500 --> 2:27:56.780]  and blood and feces. They're a lot less careful about that milk because
[2:27:56.780 --> 2:28:01.340]  they know it's going through that killstatt. Yeah, well, just what we wanted for lunch,
[2:28:01.340 --> 2:28:04.940]  huh? Dead feces and that's okay for school lunch programs.
[2:28:04.940 --> 2:28:10.460]  Right, exactly. Crazy. We've only got a couple minutes in this segment. Now, can you give
[2:28:10.460 --> 2:28:14.500]  us any more clue about who else is going to be at this event on Friday in Baraboo, Wisconsin?
[2:28:14.500 --> 2:28:18.700]  And we want to encourage all info warriors who can attend. Please attend. What time of
[2:28:18.700 --> 2:28:23.180]  the day? That's at 11am? It starts at 11am central time, yes.
[2:28:23.180 --> 2:28:27.500]  Okay. And who else is going to be there? Well, Vernon, of course, it is a hearing for
[2:28:27.500 --> 2:28:36.220]  him and a lot of his buying club owners, the co-owners of his farm and food activists and
[2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:42.260]  food freedom activists from around the country. Okay, good. Do we still have a camera person
[2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:46.260]  there? We haven't had a chance to talk since then, but I pledged a dollar amount to hire
[2:28:46.260 --> 2:28:49.060]  a camera person so we could get footage. Is that still in play?
[2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:53.500]  Yeah, this is still in play, yes. Okay, great. We're doing everything we can to support this.
[2:28:53.500 --> 2:28:56.260]  So as soon as you get the footage, let us know. We'll get that posted. We'll share it
[2:28:56.260 --> 2:29:00.980]  with info wars and maybe they can get it posted on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube as well.
[2:29:00.980 --> 2:29:07.900]  Okay. It might become a very interesting event. Okay. Well, that's what we want. And rest
[2:29:07.900 --> 2:29:12.020]  assured that whatever happens there is going to be on the record, on camera, the world
[2:29:12.020 --> 2:29:15.740]  is going to see it. It'll probably have millions of views over the next year of people watching
[2:29:15.740 --> 2:29:19.980]  that event. Well, I certainly hope so because it's time for people really to start getting
[2:29:19.980 --> 2:29:24.740]  behind the farmers or we're going to not have that food availability. Well, that's the thing
[2:29:24.740 --> 2:29:27.820]  that people don't realize if they can come after your raw milk today, they can come after
[2:29:27.820 --> 2:29:32.420]  your backyard garden tomorrow. They can, they can outlaw you sprouting seeds in your own
[2:29:32.420 --> 2:29:38.900]  kitchen counter. I mean, they can outlaw anything. Stay with us, Liz. There's a lot more straight
[2:29:38.900 --> 2:29:43.180]  ahead here on the Alex Jones show. We'll be right back after this break with a continuing

[2:33:21.540 --> 2:33:26.460]  Blacks everybody, this is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones show and I want to encourage you
[2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:31.580]  to call in if you want to ask a question of Liz Reitzig who's speaking to us today about
[2:33:31.580 --> 2:33:38.660]  raw milk and food freedom. The number to call in is 1-800-259-9231. We'll be taking calls
[2:33:38.660 --> 2:33:44.300]  in the next segment. Now Liz, I've got a question for you. Some part of me thinks that maybe
[2:33:44.300 --> 2:33:48.420]  this whole oppression of raw milk and the fact that they keep bringing, the government
[2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:55.140]  keeps bringing guns to these scenes is an attempt at escalation to try to get a reaction
[2:33:55.140 --> 2:34:00.220]  from some raw milk farmer to shoot back so that they can then paint all dairy farmers
[2:34:00.220 --> 2:34:04.300]  as terrorists. Have you heard anything along those lines? I mean, that's just my theory,
[2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:05.300]  but what do you think?
[2:34:05.300 --> 2:34:10.620]  Well, it's an interesting theory. No, I'm a little more optimistic than that and I think
[2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:16.420]  it's just their own aggression. I don't think they're really trying to get the dairy farmers
[2:34:16.420 --> 2:34:22.380]  to be aggressive. It's just the government being aggressive in there. Yeah. And when
[2:34:22.380 --> 2:34:26.660]  you pick the aggressive government against a very peaceful farmer, just the contrast
[2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:32.700]  is astounding and it just highlights how aggressive the government is being. But also, isn't it
[2:34:32.700 --> 2:34:36.740]  a violation of everything this country was founded on? I mean, we wouldn't have the United
[2:34:36.740 --> 2:34:42.140]  States of America if it wasn't for farmers growing, for example, industrial hemp back
[2:34:42.140 --> 2:34:47.380]  in the day, producing raw milk and fresh milk, bartering food with their neighbors. I mean,
[2:34:47.380 --> 2:34:49.340]  that's what this country was founded on.
[2:34:49.340 --> 2:34:53.940]  That's right. And that's what, I mean, historically, it's like, that's what builds communities
[2:34:53.940 --> 2:34:55.940]  and that's what strengthens them.
[2:34:55.940 --> 2:35:02.900]  Yeah. Yeah. Well said, absolutely. I do want to go to callers here. Yeah, we've got plenty
[2:35:02.900 --> 2:35:08.140]  of time. Okay, let's go to Nathan in Oklahoma. You're on the air with Liz Wright-Jig on the
[2:35:08.140 --> 2:35:10.220]  Alex Jones Show. Go ahead, Nathan.
[2:35:10.220 --> 2:35:17.220]  Hi. I'm actually doing my best to run as an independent candidate for the presidential
[2:35:17.220 --> 2:35:24.380]  election this year. And with this raw milk issue, we also need to go back to the basics
[2:35:24.380 --> 2:35:31.340]  that the soil depletion and all that in order for the food that we feed the cows in order
[2:35:31.340 --> 2:35:37.340]  for that to be nutritious, in order for them to have healthy immune systems, healthy structures.
[2:35:37.340 --> 2:35:42.340]  Couldn't agree with you more, Nathan. Are you a farmer or do you have experience as a
[2:35:42.340 --> 2:35:43.340]  farmer?
[2:35:43.340 --> 2:35:45.340]  Yeah, a lot of my relatives are.
[2:35:45.340 --> 2:35:48.340]  Do you have a question for Liz?
[2:35:48.340 --> 2:36:00.340]  How would you propose to get on a larger scale healthier milk and real milk to Americans?
[2:36:00.340 --> 2:36:05.340]  Well, it's just going to happen one farmer at a time and what they're going to need to
[2:36:05.340 --> 2:36:10.140]  do, and a lot of them have begun, they're going to need to transition from the conventional
[2:36:10.140 --> 2:36:15.420]  dairies back out to pasture. And I totally agree with what you're saying. The soil is
[2:36:15.420 --> 2:36:21.660]  very depleted and it took thousands of years for the soil to develop to the point where
[2:36:21.660 --> 2:36:27.740]  it was as rich as it was when, for example, when the buffalo were roaming. And to get
[2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:31.260]  it back, farmers are really going to have to be good stewards of the land and cultivate
[2:36:31.260 --> 2:36:35.380]  the land. And consumers are going to have to help with that. Like there's just no getting
[2:36:35.380 --> 2:36:39.740]  around it. Like we cannot just sit back and let the farmers do all the work anymore. You
[2:36:39.740 --> 2:36:42.740]  know, we've got to be active participants in our own food supply.
[2:36:42.740 --> 2:36:46.340]  Yeah, know where your food comes from and buy local whenever you can. Thanks for your
[2:36:46.340 --> 2:36:50.740]  question, Nathan. Good question. Joe from Arkansas, you're on the air with Liz Reitzig.
[2:36:50.740 --> 2:36:51.740]  Go ahead, Joe.
[2:36:51.740 --> 2:36:56.940]  Yeah, okay. My question for Liz is this. I suspect that one of the main reasons for the
[2:36:56.940 --> 2:37:01.460]  decline of America in the late 20th and 21st century is milk pasteurization. And here's
[2:37:01.460 --> 2:37:06.260]  why this is my suspicion, because as I understand it, the brain has a lot of fat and the brain
[2:37:06.260 --> 2:37:10.980]  needs healthy fats growing up and developing and that the main fat that kids used to get
[2:37:10.980 --> 2:37:15.860]  growing up, the main healthy fat that they would get would be from raw milk. And when
[2:37:15.860 --> 2:37:19.860]  milk started to be pasteurized, the kids wouldn't get that healthy fat that helps the brain
[2:37:19.860 --> 2:37:24.860]  develop normally anymore. So they wouldn't be as intelligent and have as good of a moral
[2:37:24.860 --> 2:37:29.900]  nature as kids growing up used to. And that would be one of the main declines for the
[2:37:29.900 --> 2:37:34.860]  America and main reason for the decline of America in the late 20th and 21st century.
[2:37:34.860 --> 2:37:39.780]  And my question is, do you know of any scientific evidence that would show that I might possibly
[2:37:39.780 --> 2:37:40.780]  be right there?
[2:37:40.780 --> 2:37:44.980]  Well, let me clarify that before Liz takes it. Pasteurized milk still does contain fat,
[2:37:44.980 --> 2:37:49.620]  but it is homogenized, which means the fat molecules are modified to become more artificial
[2:37:49.620 --> 2:37:53.380]  in the structure. So that is a very interesting theory that you've asserted there. What do
[2:37:53.380 --> 2:37:56.060]  you think, Liz? Could there be any truth to that?
[2:37:56.060 --> 2:38:02.820]  Well, certainly good nutrition is important component of any culture. And certainly we've
[2:38:02.820 --> 2:38:08.460]  had some slips in that where we have not been providing as good of nutrition as we can to
[2:38:08.460 --> 2:38:16.820]  our younger generations. Now, whether or not that's primarily responsible for the decline
[2:38:16.820 --> 2:38:21.700]  of anything, I'm not sure. And I definitely am not aware of any studies that affirm that.
[2:38:21.700 --> 2:38:26.980]  Well, I think there are so many factors involved there. Milk could certainly be one of them.
[2:38:26.980 --> 2:38:28.580]  Did you have a follow up comment there, sir?
[2:38:28.580 --> 2:38:29.580]  No, I'm good.
[2:38:29.580 --> 2:38:33.220]  Okay. Thank you. Thank you for your call. Let's go to John and Michigan. Do you have
[2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:35.420]  a question for Liz? Go ahead, John.
[2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:43.060]  Yes, good afternoon. Do you know Greg Neumdorf? This is your guest. Hello?
[2:38:43.060 --> 2:38:46.460]  No, I don't. I'm sorry. I thought you were speaking to Liz.
[2:38:46.460 --> 2:38:48.260]  Liz, do you know Greg?
[2:38:48.260 --> 2:38:49.260]  Yes.
[2:38:49.260 --> 2:38:57.020]  Okay, good. He's a friend. But there's a doctor here in Michigan, Northern Michigan,
[2:38:57.020 --> 2:39:04.660]  and he has an article in regards to A1 and A2 cows. Are you familiar with A1, A2 cows?
[2:39:04.660 --> 2:39:05.660]  Yes.
[2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:06.660]  Yes, definitely.
[2:39:06.660 --> 2:39:11.540]  Okay. I don't know if you're audiences, but the A2 cows are the ones that are supposed
[2:39:11.540 --> 2:39:15.860]  to be the ones that we drink the milk from and the A1 are the ones that are supposed
[2:39:15.860 --> 2:39:20.100]  to be the ones we eat. I think it has to do with the amount of casein that's in the milk
[2:39:20.100 --> 2:39:25.900]  and that there's a patent on this genetic makeup of these A2 cows, which is just horrendous
[2:39:25.900 --> 2:39:31.260]  that they have something like that to control it. I would just, if you have any time to
[2:39:31.260 --> 2:39:40.020]  explain what the A1, A2 are, go to emineral.info. That's the doctor's website, emineral.info.
[2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:42.540]  Go ahead, Liz. Yeah, go ahead and explain the difference for our listeners.
[2:39:42.540 --> 2:39:46.660]  Well, I have to admit, I'm not very well versed in that. I know there is a difference
[2:39:46.660 --> 2:39:51.860]  and that the A2 protein is preferable, but I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of
[2:39:51.860 --> 2:39:58.460]  that, but I do recommend that anybody who has any type of digestive issues with dairy
[2:39:58.460 --> 2:40:03.460]  that they look into the differing proteins, the A1 versus the A2 protein, because there's
[2:40:03.460 --> 2:40:10.060]  a lot of indication that the A2 protein is more accessible to a broader population of
[2:40:10.060 --> 2:40:11.060]  people.
[2:40:11.060 --> 2:40:15.860]  And to that also, the overriding issue is that the pasteurization of milk from either
[2:40:15.860 --> 2:40:21.900]  a variety of cow destroys the lactase enzyme that allows your body to more easily digest
[2:40:21.900 --> 2:40:27.020]  the lactose. So many of the side effects and problems that process dairy tends to cause
[2:40:27.020 --> 2:40:32.740]  in people, constipation, sinus problems, even a buildup of arterial plaque, atherosclerosis,
[2:40:32.740 --> 2:40:37.500]  for example, may be attributed to the inability to digest the milk due to the destruction
[2:40:37.500 --> 2:40:41.740]  of the lactase enzyme due to heat processing. So sorry to get too technical for everybody
[2:40:41.740 --> 2:40:45.420]  out there, but good question. Marshall, in Oklahoma, you're on the air. Go ahead with
[2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:46.420]  the question, please, sir.
[2:40:46.420 --> 2:40:47.420]  Hey, how are y'all?
[2:40:47.420 --> 2:40:48.420]  Hey, doing great, man.
[2:40:48.420 --> 2:40:55.780]  Good deal. I just want to make a statement that there's farmers out there. As long as
[2:40:55.780 --> 2:41:01.220]  they know that we want the milk and we seep them out, then they're probably more than
[2:41:01.220 --> 2:41:07.020]  likely to provide us with what we're asking them for. As long as we find them and ask
[2:41:07.020 --> 2:41:08.020]  them.
[2:41:08.020 --> 2:41:13.180]  And I guess my question would be, is there any tips that y'all would have for finding
[2:41:13.180 --> 2:41:18.500]  a local farmer that would be able to provide you with fresh milk and other fresh produce
[2:41:18.500 --> 2:41:19.500]  and things?
[2:41:19.500 --> 2:41:20.980]  You want to take that, Liz? Go ahead.
[2:41:20.980 --> 2:41:26.380]  Sure. There's a wonderful website called RealMilk.com, and it's a project of the West
[2:41:26.380 --> 2:41:32.580]  Bay Price Foundation, and they list by location, by state, all the raw milk providers within
[2:41:32.580 --> 2:41:36.820]  that area, or at least all the ones who are willing to be listed. And if you don't see
[2:41:36.820 --> 2:41:41.860]  anybody near you or if you're in a state that prohibits the sale of raw milk, you can also
[2:41:41.860 --> 2:41:47.340]  look up on the West Bay Price Foundation website for the local chapter leaders and contact
[2:41:47.340 --> 2:41:52.100]  them directly because often they will have additional information.
[2:41:52.100 --> 2:41:55.580]  You know, I want to speak to that too. Part of the issue here is that as the federal government
[2:41:55.580 --> 2:42:00.340]  and even state governments in California, for example, when they go after more raw milk
[2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:05.260]  farmers, it sends a message that if you try to do this, you're going to be arrested at
[2:42:05.260 --> 2:42:10.380]  gunpoint, and you're going to find yourself in court. So it suppresses that entire activity
[2:42:10.380 --> 2:42:14.180]  by farmers, and that is by design, of course. Any comments on that, Liz?
[2:42:14.180 --> 2:42:19.420]  Well, yeah, if you do go that route, and especially if you need to call a chapter leader about
[2:42:19.420 --> 2:42:24.100]  it, you want to just make sure you let them know as much about you as possible because
[2:42:24.100 --> 2:42:29.060]  right now what happens is FDA, you know, I don't know if Jonathan spoke about this on
[2:42:29.060 --> 2:42:36.460]  your last segment, but the FDA has actually been putting undercover spy people into buying
[2:42:36.460 --> 2:42:37.460]  clubs.
[2:42:37.460 --> 2:42:38.460]  Infiltrators, yeah, spies.
[2:42:38.460 --> 2:42:44.060]  Infiltrators, right. And so, you know, people who, farmers, they want to know their customers
[2:42:44.060 --> 2:42:47.900]  and they want to know that they're not an undercover spy coming to try to shut them
[2:42:47.900 --> 2:42:53.740]  down. So people, and especially the people who connect consumers to the farmers, they
[2:42:53.740 --> 2:42:58.340]  need to know as well so that they feel safe saying, okay, yeah, this person you can sell
[2:42:58.340 --> 2:43:01.140]  milk to, or you can have them in your buying club.
[2:43:01.140 --> 2:43:06.220]  You know, I'm just astounded by just listening to this myself, sitting here in the command
[2:43:06.220 --> 2:43:12.580]  center of Info Wars, how little the mainstream public knows about any of this. The hoax media
[2:43:12.580 --> 2:43:17.100]  refuses to cover it. People aren't taught the difference between pasteurized milk versus
[2:43:17.100 --> 2:43:20.780]  fresh milk. They don't even know pasteurized milk is filthy. They don't even know it has
[2:43:20.780 --> 2:43:24.780]  pus in it or blood or feces. They don't know this. Nobody's ever told them this information.
[2:43:24.780 --> 2:43:28.860]  So spread the word on this, folks. Get the word out about this video clip once it's up
[2:43:28.860 --> 2:43:32.620]  on YouTube and spread the word about this show so people are better informed. Thank you
[2:43:32.620 --> 2:43:36.820]  for your question there, sir. Let's go to Ronnie in Texas. You're on the air with Liz
[2:43:36.820 --> 2:43:38.620]  Wrights. Go ahead, please.
[2:43:38.620 --> 2:43:46.140]  Rupert, thank you, sir. And I just wanted to say it's, I truly believe that absolute
[2:43:46.140 --> 2:43:53.100]  freedom for farmers is the key to life on our garden planet. And of course, your wonderful
[2:43:53.100 --> 2:43:58.180]  movement with the milk is the real clear who can deny the righteousness of where you're
[2:43:58.180 --> 2:44:05.860]  going. And what I'm trying to say is that I see it as a concept, potentially is helping
[2:44:05.860 --> 2:44:13.300]  to solve the entire planet of death, cults and all the rest of it and reorient ourselves
[2:44:13.300 --> 2:44:20.820]  back to a more living, celebrating life by allowing family farms to exist and encouraging
[2:44:20.820 --> 2:44:28.460]  them and organic farming and less Monsanto or Monsanto.
[2:44:28.460 --> 2:44:31.660]  This is Ronnie. This is Ronnie Reeferseed, right?
[2:44:31.660 --> 2:44:33.140]  You got it, yes, sir. Thank you.
[2:44:33.140 --> 2:44:36.500]  Yes, I've heard you on the show many times. Let me ask you a question. So do you see these
[2:44:36.500 --> 2:44:40.740]  strong parallels then between raw milk freedom and let's say industrial hemp freedom, just
[2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:44.060]  farming freedom? I mean, what other examples do you see out there of those?
[2:44:44.060 --> 2:44:51.540]  Well, that is such a great point because there's really no limit to the, we can build houses
[2:44:51.540 --> 2:44:59.100]  with hemp products. I mean, hemp is an incredibly strong fiber and not to mention the literally
[2:44:59.100 --> 2:45:03.020]  thousands of years of research that have been going on to the medicinal or the flowering
[2:45:03.020 --> 2:45:08.380]  part of it, but either the flowering or just the male hemp plant is incredibly beneficial
[2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:13.540]  and been used for, like I said, eons. I think it's a real medicine.
[2:45:13.540 --> 2:45:17.180]  Farming milk is a type of medicine too. In fact, do you have a question, Ronnie, for
[2:45:17.180 --> 2:45:21.060]  Liz? She's our guest right now. Do you have a question for her?
[2:45:21.060 --> 2:45:28.500]  Well, specifically, I was asking her opinion if she also saw the correlation between the
[2:45:28.500 --> 2:45:32.740]  absolute freedom for farmers. I mean, I was just trying to expand that she's obviously
[2:45:32.740 --> 2:45:36.940]  one huge part of that. And I was just trying to make the point that it's not only, you
[2:45:36.940 --> 2:45:44.180]  know, for, well, it promotes peace and it ends war and ends killing people with, you
[2:45:44.180 --> 2:45:49.780]  know, all these evil chemicals and pesticides. And I mean, that's, that's right.
[2:45:49.780 --> 2:45:54.540]  All these things are not unrelated. I mean, you're exactly right, Ronnie. And by the
[2:45:54.540 --> 2:45:58.820]  way, good to meet you on the air here. Liz, can you speak to that? Why food freedom is
[2:45:58.820 --> 2:46:01.940]  essential for peace and abundance on our planet?
[2:46:01.940 --> 2:46:08.820]  Well, wow, that's certainly an avalanche there. But yeah, it is because, you know, when we
[2:46:08.820 --> 2:46:15.620]  have that freedom to engage directly with the producer or farmer of our choice, I mean,
[2:46:15.620 --> 2:46:22.180]  that opens up worlds that don't exist right now and that can exist. And I really see this
[2:46:22.180 --> 2:46:27.420]  whole issue of food freedom and raw milk kind of being the catalyst for it as this is like
[2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:32.660]  a gateway into the rest of the freedoms. Because once you realize you can, you can in fact
[2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:38.420]  safely engage directly with farmers, like that just opens up a whole new realm, a whole
[2:46:38.420 --> 2:46:41.140]  new paradigm of freedom.
[2:46:41.140 --> 2:46:45.420]  I think also the flip side to that is that the GMO food and the processed food and the
[2:46:45.420 --> 2:46:51.060]  dead food is really the food of enslavement. That's the food of war, the food of conflict,
[2:46:51.060 --> 2:46:55.660]  the food of being dumbed down. And so, you know, you can choose what kind of society
[2:46:55.660 --> 2:46:59.860]  you want to build based on what kind of food you eat. Would you agree with that, Liz?
[2:46:59.860 --> 2:47:04.820]  Absolutely. And, you know, I mean, it's very telling because the products that are used
[2:47:04.820 --> 2:47:10.820]  to grow GMO crops are the leftover products from war.
[2:47:10.820 --> 2:47:13.380]  What do you mean?
[2:47:13.380 --> 2:47:23.340]  Well, the pesticides and the herbicides that they spray on the GMO crops are derived from
[2:47:23.340 --> 2:47:25.700]  chemical agents used in World War II.
[2:47:25.700 --> 2:47:29.740]  Yeah, you're right. Well, chemotherapy is as well. The same derived from the same thing,
[2:47:29.740 --> 2:47:36.620]  IG Farben, the chemotherapy agents are a type of poison. By the way, I've just been handed
[2:47:36.620 --> 2:47:39.220]  some breaking news and want to mention this very quickly and then we'll continue with
[2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:45.860]  you, Liz. FEMA puts out contracts for emergency camps to house, quote, displaced citizens.
[2:47:45.860 --> 2:47:50.340]  This is an article by Paul Joseph Watson. It's posted on infowars.com right now. So
[2:47:50.340 --> 2:47:55.940]  go to infowars, check that out. I haven't read this article yet, but glancing over here,
[2:47:55.940 --> 2:48:00.340]  it says the camps will be able to service up to 2,000 people at one time. It also indicates
[2:48:00.340 --> 2:48:06.940]  that the FEMA camp operations will be positioned in the context of social service. Yeah, we're
[2:48:06.940 --> 2:48:12.180]  going to help you come to our little camp. You can come in, but you can never leave.
[2:48:12.180 --> 2:48:14.540]  That's the kind of FEMA camp that they're setting up.
[2:48:14.540 --> 2:48:18.420]  Getting back to our callers, I apologize for that interruption there, Liz. We've got Marlin
[2:48:18.420 --> 2:48:21.900]  from Michigan on the phone. Marlin, go ahead with your question for Liz.
[2:48:21.900 --> 2:48:32.780]  Hi, hi. Yes, I was just wondering if you have had any exposure to camel milk and what's
[2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:40.460]  happening on that line. I'm actually a camel farmer and we're having some really amazing
[2:48:40.460 --> 2:48:45.980]  benefits that we're seeing amongst us. Your phone's kind of breaking up there and I assume
[2:48:45.980 --> 2:48:50.420]  you're serious about this. It sounds kind of funny to maybe too many people. Liz, have
[2:48:50.420 --> 2:48:54.220]  you heard of any camel milk farmers out there? I have. I've heard of them and I've actually
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:48:59.220]  been to a farm that has camels that they milk. However, I have not personally had any of
[2:48:59.220 --> 2:49:04.420]  the camel milk, but I'm eager to try it. It sounds delightful and I've heard that it makes
[2:49:04.420 --> 2:49:10.900]  a very interesting fermented milk product. That's something new that I learned. Thank
[2:49:10.900 --> 2:49:15.700]  you for that call, sir. Marlin, very interesting. Sorry about cutting you off. Your phone
[2:49:15.700 --> 2:49:22.340]  was very staticky. About that story, the FEMA announcement that's on infowars.com right
[2:49:22.340 --> 2:49:28.000]  now, I missed a key point that the solicitation calls for the camps to be ready for occupancy
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:35.100]  within 72 hours. Now, I don't know if that means 72 hours from now or 72 hours from some
[2:49:35.100 --> 2:49:40.780]  activation alert or some announcement, but clearly the time scale on this is accelerating.
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:46.300]  The FEMA camps are cranking up for operations. You can only imagine what that is in anticipation
[2:49:46.300 --> 2:49:51.340]  of. Something perhaps is coming down the line. Again, sorry for the interruption. Liz, we've
[2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:57.500]  got about a minute left in this segment. Time for one more call of Bregan in Wisconsin.
[2:49:57.500 --> 2:50:01.140]  You're on the phone. We're almost out of time, so go ahead quickly, please.
[2:50:01.140 --> 2:50:07.220]  Hi, Mike and Liz. I actually own a restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin, and I've spoken with
[2:50:07.220 --> 2:50:15.580]  Max and Vernon in the past. I think I spoke with you actually last fall, Liz. We use organic
[2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:21.300]  products in our restaurant. I was wondering if Mike could talk about Justice Patrick J.
[2:50:21.300 --> 2:50:26.780]  Fiedler and the broader issue of food rights and your inherent rights to actually grow
[2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:29.780]  your own food. I know Liz was following that as well.
[2:50:29.780 --> 2:50:33.580]  Well, let me put that to Liz, since she's our guest right now. Liz, you want to go ahead
[2:50:33.580 --> 2:50:40.340]  and address that in 30 seconds. That's tough. Well, not to put you on the spot. We definitely
[2:50:40.340 --> 2:50:44.780]  have our rights and included in that. It's procuring our own food. And if you're interested
[2:50:44.780 --> 2:50:48.220]  in learning more about it, we're having a break. We've got to go to break. Sorry, Liz.
[2:50:48.220 --> 2:51:04.260]  Sorry to cut you off. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.
[2:51:04.260 --> 2:51:34.020]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[2:51:34.020 --> 2:52:01.820]  The
[2:52:01.820 --> 2:52:07.060]  digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. That bears repeating.
[2:52:07.060 --> 2:52:12.580]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. And ProEM1, daily probiotic
[2:52:12.580 --> 2:52:18.260]  cleanse is the key to digestive health. ProEM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough

[2:52:57.260 --> 2:53:01.340]  ProEM1, The Raw Probiotic.
[2:53:01.340 --> 2:53:05.260]  Powerful forces are trying to destroy your health. It's a fact that we're surrounded
[2:53:05.260 --> 2:53:10.220]  by a sea of environmental toxins, from mercury in vaccines and dental fillings, to aluminum
[2:53:10.220 --> 2:53:16.100]  and chemtrails, to pesticides and toxic chemicals sprayed all over our food. Even nuclear radiation,
[2:53:16.100 --> 2:53:19.780]  which is still spewing out of Fukushima, has contaminated the water and food supply
[2:53:19.780 --> 2:53:25.460]  in the U.S. But there is a solution. Liquid zeolite is an extraordinary natural formula
[2:53:25.460 --> 2:53:30.020]  which safely and effectively removes all kinds of toxins from the body, including capturing

[2:53:59.980 --> 2:54:13.980]  All right, we just wrapped up our interview with Liz Wright-Dig from RawMilkFreedomRiders.com.
[2:54:13.980 --> 2:54:17.900]  I want to encourage all the InfoWarriors out there to go to that website. Check out the
[2:54:17.900 --> 2:54:22.580]  event details. That's coming up, what, 11 a.m. this Friday in Baraboo, Wisconsin? Please
[2:54:22.580 --> 2:54:27.500]  be there. Be part of this history in the making where the Declaration of Food Independence
[2:54:27.500 --> 2:54:33.740]  is going to be released. And I'm sure you'll hear a lot more about that statement, that
[2:54:33.740 --> 2:54:39.620]  announcement, that declaration here on InfoWars.com, as well as my website, Natural News. We'll
[2:54:39.620 --> 2:54:44.020]  be covering it at both places. Some other breaking news, I want to be sure to get to
[2:54:44.020 --> 2:54:50.500]  you today. I promised this earlier, the FAA has set a timetable now for allowing drones
[2:54:50.500 --> 2:54:56.580]  to be in the skies above America. September 30th, 2015 is the day that the nation's skies
[2:54:56.580 --> 2:55:03.020]  will be open to drones of even big drones. Now, the first step towards that comes in
[2:55:03.020 --> 2:55:09.020]  just 90 days, 90 days from today, when police, firefighters, and other civilian first response
[2:55:09.020 --> 2:55:17.100]  agencies can start flying drones, weighing no more than 4.4 pounds. And then by May 2013,
[2:55:17.100 --> 2:55:22.980]  that's going to be expanded to drones weighing less than 55 pounds. And then the full integration
[2:55:22.980 --> 2:55:29.260]  of drones, those are their words, full integration of drones. Sounds very nice and peaceful, doesn't
[2:55:29.260 --> 2:55:35.460]  it? Into U.S. airspace in September 30th, 2015. So we are going to be inundated with
[2:55:35.460 --> 2:55:40.540]  spy drones, looking into our backyards, looking into our gardens, watching every little move
[2:55:40.540 --> 2:55:44.380]  that we do in our lives. Now, some other very important information to bring you. This is
[2:55:44.380 --> 2:55:50.900]  an article published in mcnews.com. It's called The Sting. It reveals that police all over
[2:55:50.900 --> 2:55:57.140]  the country are setting up fake construction zones and then writing speeding tickets.
[2:55:57.140 --> 2:56:05.220]  One fake construction zone in Washington State was able to write 76 speeding tickets. Well,
[2:56:05.220 --> 2:56:09.300]  one ticket every two minutes. For a total of $8,000 per hour being collected by the
[2:56:09.300 --> 2:56:13.620]  police there, the idea is working so well for these broke local governments that it's
[2:56:13.620 --> 2:56:17.740]  being set up in Denver, Colorado. There's a fake construction zone set up at the exit
[2:56:17.740 --> 2:56:23.020]  from the Denver International Airport. They trick you into thinking that it's a 45 mile
[2:56:23.020 --> 2:56:27.300]  an hour zone. In fact, there's a little sign there. It drops to 25 miles an hour and it
[2:56:27.300 --> 2:56:31.460]  says fines are doubled because this is a construction zone. But there's no construction there. There's
[2:56:31.460 --> 2:56:36.900]  just a bunch of cops there waiting to write tickets by entrapping you in a false construction
[2:56:36.900 --> 2:56:42.140]  zone, a fake construction zone. Also, in Dallas, Texas, an investigation there has found that
[2:56:42.140 --> 2:56:48.220]  traffic cameras are being combined with shortened duration of yellow lights to make sure that
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:52.460]  you run the yellow light or you run the red light effectively because the yellow light
[2:56:52.460 --> 2:56:58.980]  is shortened in order to generate revenue on that camera. At one camera, they generated
[2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:06.300]  $9,407 worth over $700,000 between January and August of last year. So that's what it's
[2:57:06.300 --> 2:57:10.740]  come to, folks. Forget your freedoms. Forget law. It's all revenue generation. Just another
[2:57:10.740 --> 2:57:15.800]  way to trap you into paying more of your money to the state. Now, I've got one more thing
[2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:20.220]  to announce. I just finished a mini-documentary called False Environmentalism and I want
[2:57:20.220 --> 2:57:23.980]  to roll the first 60 seconds of that for you so you get a look at that. You can find this
[2:57:23.980 --> 2:57:28.220]  on YouTube.com. Just search for False Environmentalism. Go ahead and roll that. I want you to
[2:57:28.220 --> 2:57:29.220]  see it.
[2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:39.740]  Are you fed up with false environmentalism that says we have to stop breathing in order
[2:57:39.740 --> 2:57:46.740]  to save the planet? Here are five things you can do right now to really save the environment
[2:57:46.740 --> 2:57:52.940]  without giving up your freedom or surrendering to oppressive government mandates. And these
[2:57:52.940 --> 2:57:58.660]  five things are probably not what you think. Many people, for example, think that changing
[2:57:58.660 --> 2:58:04.020]  their light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights will save the planet. And they applaud the
[2:58:04.020 --> 2:58:10.260]  government's light bulb mandates. But CFLs are loaded with toxic mercury. And when you
[2:58:10.260 --> 2:58:17.420]  throw them away, they release mercury directly into local landfills and water aquifers. Or
[2:58:17.420 --> 2:58:23.220]  you might think you could save the planet by driving the much coveted Toyota Prius.
[2:58:23.220 --> 2:58:28.420]  But a Prius is made with electric motors and batteries which are themselves made out
