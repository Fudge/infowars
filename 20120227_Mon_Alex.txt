[00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:10.166]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.747]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:13.309]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.492]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:21.575]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.331]  Welcome everyone, it's Monday, February 27th, 2012.
[00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:46.554]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:53.918]  Alex is on the road, just finished up a very successful live event in Orlando yesterday, a complete sellout.
[00:00:53.918 --> 00:01:02.744]  Over a thousand people showed up, he sold out that event, the first time in fact that that venue has been sold out ever in the history of the venue, I think over 50 years.
[00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:07.647]  We've got a ton of news coming up for you today, including some commentary on the school shooting.
[00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:09.388]  That has been reported this morning.
[00:01:09.388 --> 00:01:16.874]  We've got news on the Stratfor information leaks that WikiLeaks is now publishing.
[00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:17.995]  Got that information coming out.
[00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:22.859]  We've got also some interesting satire bits that I hope you'll enjoy.
[00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.804]  I've got one coming up on 10 vaccines we really need instead of the ones we actually get.
[00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:29.284]  That's coming up.
[00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:30.205]  Hope you enjoy that.
[00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:34.147]  We like to combine information with a bit of comic relief.
[00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:41.450]  And along those lines, at the bottom of this hour, we also have ventriloquist Ian Varela joining us with his character, Old Man Gramps.
[00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.755]  Now, for those of you on the radio, of course, you won't get to see him operating his character, but if you go to PrisonPlanet.tv and watch this, you'll be able to see that.
[00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:52.276]  In any case, his voice acting is fantastic.
[00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:53.316]  That should be a really funny bit.
[00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:54.017]  We've got that coming up.
[00:01:55.023 --> 00:01:58.586]  Also today, at the top of the next hour, Jonathan Emord joins us.
[00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.088]  He is a health freedom attorney.
[00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:06.412]  He's the author of the new book, Restoring the Republic, with a foreword written by Ron Paul.
[00:02:06.412 --> 00:02:14.018]  We'll be interviewing him about his ideas, which are very solid, very progressive, and very much restoring the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:14.018 --> 00:02:19.302]  Those ideas, you'll hear more about them at the top of the next hour, when Jonathan Emord is our guest.
[00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:24.446]  And then finally, in the third hour, we've got Liz Reitzig, or Reitzig, I believe that's how she pronounces it,
[00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:31.809]  Joining us to talk about some very important events coming up this week about raw milk and food freedom.
[00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:36.951]  Yeah, there's a big event coming up this week that's driving the establishment absolutely crazy!
[00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:42.794]  And you need to know about it, and we're going to ask for your help to participate in that in any way you can.
[00:02:42.794 --> 00:02:45.015]  Now getting to some other breaking news, we've also got
[00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:55.112]  We've got news about a peer-to-peer alternative news distribution application for computers.
[00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:57.113]  I put out the call for someone to build that.
[00:02:57.113 --> 00:02:59.653]  We'll talk about that after this coming break.
[00:02:59.653 --> 00:03:09.455]  We've got Wyoming advances a doomsday bill to look at what the state should do in the case of a total economic collapse.
[00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:10.155]  That's coming up.
[00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:11.415]  We've got the UK.
[00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:15.256]  George Osborne admits the UK has run out of money.
[00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.630]  Yeah, we'll hear more about that on the other side.
[00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.053]  We've also got Obama playing the race card, calling on churches to support the campaign.
[00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:29.197]  A new Harvard study says that pasteurized milk from industrial dairies is definitely linked to cancer.
[00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:32.279]  You know how they're always attacking raw milk and saying it's so dangerous for you.
[00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.721]  Oh my God, don't drink anything that's alive.
[00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:43.487]  Well, they don't tell you the truth, that pasteurized milk is so filthy that if they didn't pasteurize it and kill everything in it, that milk would probably kill you
[00:03:44.247 --> 00:03:45.130]  Overnight!
[00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.896]  It's very dirty and it has again been linked to cancer.
[00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:49.921]  We'll get into more of that.
[00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:52.909]  We've got the emails from WikiLeaks already mentioned that.
[00:03:54.113 --> 00:04:07.580]  And then the actual glossary of terms from Stratfor, where they get into describing the ATF and the FBI and Israeli intelligence and some of the other interesting organizations around the world.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.142]  All that coming up and much more.
[00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:14.164]  Plus, a mystery virus kills thousands of lambs in the UK.
[00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:16.605]  This is being published by The Telegraph.
[00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:20.728]  The National Farmers Union has called it a catastrophe and a ticking time bomb.
[00:04:21.618 --> 00:04:25.443]  We've got the TSA airport checkpoint left unattended in Sacramento.
[00:04:25.443 --> 00:04:27.265]  Yeah, they just walked off the job there.
[00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:28.727]  Well, gee, I mean, who wouldn't?
[00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.831]  If you work for the TSA, why would you want to stay?
[00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:32.552]  Right?
[00:04:32.552 --> 00:04:33.253]  And then we've got...
[00:04:34.438 --> 00:04:37.481]  Ah, drone timetables are being announced by the FAA.
[00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:38.281]  Yep.
[00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:43.705]  The skies will be open to more drones in the next 90 days.
[00:04:43.705 --> 00:04:48.990]  We'll have that timeline for you and much more when we return here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.912]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in for Alex today.
[00:04:51.912 --> 00:04:52.853]  Stay with us.
[00:04:52.853 --> 00:04:55.615]  We'll be right back with all that news and much more straight ahead.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.824]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:25.715]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:29.837]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:31.878]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:40.044]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:05:40.044 --> 00:05:46.348]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:47.629]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:48.509]  It's incredible.
[00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:57.716]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:05:57.716 --> 00:05:59.877]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:06:00.478 --> 00:06:01.779]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:07.367]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:12.394]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:12.854]  It's true.
[00:06:12.854 --> 00:06:17.420]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:23.165]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:25.486]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:30.289]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.410]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.472]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:38.095]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:38.095 --> 00:06:41.297]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:43.518]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:06:43.518 --> 00:06:44.439]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:49.501]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:49.501 --> 00:06:57.123]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:57.123 --> 00:07:01.123]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:01.123 --> 00:07:15.566]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.587 --> 00:07:21.289]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:34.054]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:41.317]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:42.017 --> 00:07:52.382]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:56.303]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:56.303 --> 00:08:01.185]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:01.185 --> 00:08:06.728]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:12.304]  Welcome back.
[00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:15.007]  It's Monday, February 27, 2012.
[00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:17.649]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:21.872]  My name is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today, who's on the road.
[00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:27.877]  He's in Orlando, Florida, just finishing up a very successful live presentation yesterday.
[00:08:27.877 --> 00:08:31.299]  We've both been on the road a lot lately, and I have to apologize.
[00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:33.161]  I'm a little bit stuffed up today.
[00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:35.603]  I sort of blew my voice out on Friday doing this.
[00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:37.463]  This bit!
[00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:41.305]  You know how I do these satire bits that are really relevant to current events?
[00:08:41.305 --> 00:08:48.107]  We did this TSA Help Wanted satire animation that was really popular that Google censored.
[00:08:48.107 --> 00:08:50.447]  And I did all the voiceover for that.
[00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.148]  I was doing this voiceover bit.
[00:08:53.194 --> 00:09:04.863]  For Bill Gates, you know, because Bill Gates, he's got his depopulation agenda and he's got all this technology that's trying to cause infertility, like these ultrasound items that are causing infertility in males.
[00:09:04.863 --> 00:09:09.407]  And you know, the mosquitoes and the GMOs and everything, it's like depopulating the planet.
[00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:12.049]  And I was doing this bit called Bill Gates the Sperminator.
[00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:15.351]  It was like the Terminator movie.
[00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:17.413]  But it was all about Bill Gates.
[00:09:17.413 --> 00:09:18.854]  And I sort of blew my voice out doing that.
[00:09:20.123 --> 00:09:26.025]  I guess I got exposed to something, so I'm slightly symptomatic, fighting it off, but feeling great.
[00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:28.827]  In fact, bring up that cartoon.
[00:09:28.827 --> 00:09:33.809]  We did publish the cartoon on Friday of Bill Gates, the Sperminator, if you would.
[00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:36.830]  For those of you watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, that's the cartoon.
[00:09:37.887 --> 00:09:40.269]  And it's a really funny bit.
[00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:41.810]  I'll do a little bit for you.
[00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:49.657]  It goes like... Using exotic technology from the future.
[00:09:49.657 --> 00:09:52.820]  One man is trying to destroy humanity.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.004]  Hasta la vista, babies.
[00:09:57.004 --> 00:09:59.346]  No más hijos.
[00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.927]  Yes, Bill Gates is trying
[00:10:02.108 --> 00:10:04.589]  The Sperminator.
[00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:07.050]  Coming soon to a theater near you.
[00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:16.395]  Humanity's only chance to fight back against the depopulation agenda is to catch him downloading Microsoft Windows updates and patches.
[00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:17.375]  Anyway, it goes on like that.
[00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:20.197]  It's just a little bit that hopefully will get finished.
[00:10:21.243 --> 00:10:21.964]  And we'll play for you.
[00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:24.045]  Nothing like a little comic relief from time to time.
[00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:28.108]  Now, speaking of that, we are going to cover all the hard-hitting news for today.
[00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:33.152]  We've got Ian Varela coming up at the bottom of this hour, Jonathan Emore to the top of the next hour.
[00:10:33.152 --> 00:10:37.336]  He has a new book called Restore the Republic with a foreword by Ron Paul.
[00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:43.681]  And we've got Liz Reitzig talking about food freedom and the raw milk events coming up later this week.
[00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:46.082]  And now let's get right to the news.
[00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:50.246]  We've got, well let's start with this one, the school shooting today.
[00:10:50.246 --> 00:10:55.991]  I'm not going to spend much time on this because all the facts haven't come out yet that are relevant, but there has been a school shooting today.
[00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:59.334]  Of course the mainstream media is going to blame guns.
[00:10:59.334 --> 00:11:00.575]  Of course.
[00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:07.902]  What won't come out is whether or not the student or whoever ended up doing the shooting, we don't know that fact yet,
[00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:11.050]  Whether or not they were on psychiatric drugs.
[00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:19.296]  Because we know that antidepressants and SSRIs and all of these psychiatric drugs cause children to feel isolated from reality.
[00:11:19.296 --> 00:11:25.521]  And the school shootings in the past, like Columbine for example, involved children who thought they were playing a video game.
[00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:28.103]  Because their minds were so disconnected from reality.
[00:11:30.114 --> 00:11:34.836]  They could run around and shoot their fellow classmates and not even feel anything, feel no empathy.
[00:11:34.836 --> 00:11:37.218]  They didn't even realize that they were doing that.
[00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:45.202]  And time and time again, not in every case, but in many cases, I would say the majority of cases, these school shootings are linked to psychiatric drugs.
[00:11:45.202 --> 00:11:52.326]  So it would be very interesting to see if this shooter or shooters, whatever the case may be, has been linked to psychiatric drugs.
[00:11:52.326 --> 00:11:55.747]  And if so, whether the mainstream media will even cover it.
[00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:58.009]  Why do we call them the mainstream, you know, the hoax media?
[00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:00.850]  We still haven't settled on a name for that.
[00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.631]  But we're not going to get into the details of that shooting until we know more about the shooter.
[00:12:05.631 --> 00:12:15.513]  But just giving you a preview of the correct way to interpret that, it's probably drug-related, psychiatric drug, FDA-approved prescription drug-related.
[00:12:15.513 --> 00:12:25.215]  Now, in other news, I've got an urgent red alert call for the development of a peer-to-peer alternative news application.
[00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:27.556]  This is a call that I put out last night on naturalnews.com.
[00:12:29.318 --> 00:12:37.765]  That we need to fight back against censorship on Google, on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook, all across the internet.
[00:12:37.765 --> 00:12:51.316]  And the way to do that is we need a team out there who can develop a peer-to-peer, a BitTorrent-like application that allows us to share and carry news, text, audio, and video news that's distributed peer-to-peer.
[00:12:51.316 --> 00:12:53.018]  There is no application like that that exists.
[00:12:53.758 --> 00:12:59.879]  I have tried to talk to Alex about that, but he's so super busy running InfoWars and he's on the road and so on.
[00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:02.220]  I just decided to go ahead and take on this project myself.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.280]  If it's successful, we will of course share it with InfoWars.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:14.562]  The idea being that InfoWars and Natural News would be the first two news organizations to use this peer-to-peer BitTorrent-like news application.
[00:13:14.562 --> 00:13:16.243]  It would bypass the search engines.
[00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:17.883]  It would bypass all the social networks.
[00:13:18.263 --> 00:13:18.664]  We're good to go.
[00:13:38.786 --> 00:13:45.829]  And share that technology with InfoWars so that we can get another pathway of getting information out to you that cannot be censored.
[00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:49.151]  This is crucial for the future of free information.
[00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:50.412]  I believe information should be free.
[00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:59.073]  And I'm also against all of the patents on seeds, all the patents on medicines, on foods, on animals, all of those things.
[00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:08.076]  I believe information should be free, and that application can help us continue to exercise our free speech rights, especially when times are getting increasingly uncertain.
[00:14:08.076 --> 00:14:18.860]  And along that note, Wyoming is now looking at a bill, House Bill 85, where they're saying this bill, if passed, would create a state-run government continuity task force
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:28.385]  Which would study and prepare Wyoming for potential catastrophes from disruptions in food supplies to a complete meltdown of the federal government.
[00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:32.727]  Isn't that interesting that the state of Wyoming is now looking at doing this?
[00:14:32.727 --> 00:14:37.970]  It would even cover Wyoming potentially issuing its own alternative currency.
[00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:38.790]  How's that?
[00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.591]  Yeah, very interesting.
[00:14:40.874 --> 00:14:46.796]  In addition, it would also examine the conditions under which Wyoming would need to implement its own military draft.
[00:14:46.796 --> 00:14:48.456]  Wow, you don't hear that very often.
[00:14:48.456 --> 00:14:53.557]  Raise a standing army and acquire strike aircraft and an aircraft carrier.
[00:14:53.557 --> 00:14:59.719]  Now, when I saw that, I thought, don't you need an ocean for an aircraft carrier?
[00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:06.261]  Because, I mean, maybe my geography is a little bit behind, but I don't think Wyoming has an ocean.
[00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:12.226]  You're going to float the aircraft carrier out there in one of the lakes in Yellowstone or something?
[00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:19.112]  But non-withstanding that little seeming glitch in their plan, they are talking about raising their own army, having a military draft potentially.
[00:15:19.112 --> 00:15:22.415]  Again, they're not saying there's any urgent issue on the horizon.
[00:15:22.415 --> 00:15:25.058]  They're just saying, you know, the world is not stable.
[00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:30.042]  Let's look at what we should do as a state to protect the rights of our citizens, to protect the safety of our citizens.
[00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:32.485]  And I think it's a, you know, I think it's an intelligent thing to do.
[00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:37.170]  But if more and more states do that, I wonder what the feds are going to think about that.
[00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.291]  How dare you states have your own army?
[00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.633]  How dare you think about your own currency?
[00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:43.054]  How dare you?
[00:15:43.054 --> 00:15:44.935]  That's what the feds are going to say about that.
[00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:48.798]  We've got a mystery virus that is killing thousands of lambs in the UK.
[00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:50.639]  Moving on to health news.
[00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:57.244]  Thousands of lambs have been killed by a new virus that's causing serious deformities such as fused limbs and twisted necks.
[00:15:58.188 --> 00:16:00.431]  Which means the newborn lambs cannot survive.
[00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:05.078]  74 farms across southern and eastern England have been hit by this virus.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.083]  The National Farmers Union in the UK has called it a ticking time bomb.
[00:16:10.083 --> 00:16:15.528]  Now when I read this news, I immediately began to think that this could be related to GMOs.
[00:16:15.528 --> 00:16:17.010]  I'm not certain of that.
[00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.031]  You know, the jury's still out on that.
[00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:19.712]  We need more science.
[00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:31.202]  But remember last week when Jeffrey Smith was on the Alex Jones Show, and Jeffrey was talking about that virus type, the size of a virus, but I'm not sure if it was actually a virus, but a new
[00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:37.694]  There's a micro-organism that has been discovered riding along with the GMOs.
[00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:40.076]  It's been discovered in the animals that are fed the GMOs.
[00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:45.701]  And he talked about how all these animals that are fed GMOs do so much better when they get to a non-GMO diet.
[00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:48.423]  So I immediately began to think, this could be a GMO issue.
[00:16:48.423 --> 00:16:53.528]  Maybe these lambs are being fed GMOs and they're being born with all these weird deformities.
[00:16:53.528 --> 00:16:55.970]  Again, I don't know that for sure, but it's something to check out.
[00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:56.691]  We do know that GMOs
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.743]  And that's clearly not a good situation.
[00:17:03.743 --> 00:17:08.547]  TSA airport checkpoint left unattended in Sacramento.
[00:17:08.547 --> 00:17:09.388]  Yes, indeed.
[00:17:09.388 --> 00:17:24.979]  The TSA quote officers, shouldn't even call them officers, the minimum wage TSA employees, whatever they are, they left their post and five people got past this unattended security checkpoint.
[00:17:25.922 --> 00:17:39.212]  As a result of the incident, here's the funny part, the officials said, again this is TSA officials, they said that two TSA officers have been removed from screening duties and are to undergo additional training.
[00:17:39.212 --> 00:17:43.476]  Like, what their initial training didn't include stay at your post?
[00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:57.803]  If you can't get that part of it down, what hope do you have as a government oppressive moron thug working at the airport reaching down people's pants?
[00:17:57.803 --> 00:17:59.064]  You can't even stay at your post.
[00:17:59.064 --> 00:18:02.226]  Isn't that the most basic thing that the TSA is supposed to do?
[00:18:02.226 --> 00:18:04.588]  Just stay at your post!
[00:18:04.588 --> 00:18:07.430]  Can't even do that.
[00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.931]  Let's see, I got something for you here.
[00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.913]  Last week, some news came out that vaccines are being developed for salmonella.
[00:18:13.913 --> 00:18:17.756]  Yeah, this is a food-borne disease, a food-borne microbe.
[00:18:17.756 --> 00:18:19.097]  Salmonella?
[00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:21.660]  It's not like you, the person, get salmonella.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.541]  It's usually in the food, and then you consume the food.
[00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:30.207]  Well, they're trying to come out with a vaccine for salmonella, and they're saying that's going to save everybody from all this contaminated food.
[00:18:30.207 --> 00:18:31.528]  What are they going to come out with next?
[00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:37.313]  A vaccine not only for every microbe in a human being, but a vaccine for every microbe that might infect some food?
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:45.182]  And it got me thinking, got me thinking that there's vaccines for all the useless stuff, but not enough vaccines for the stuff we really need.
[00:18:45.182 --> 00:18:47.703]  So guys, prep that music and that slideshow.
[00:18:47.703 --> 00:18:48.863]  Let me know when you're ready.
[00:18:48.863 --> 00:18:52.724]  I've got a little bit here about top 10 vaccines we really need.
[00:18:52.724 --> 00:18:54.445]  Let me know when that's ready.
[00:18:54.445 --> 00:19:01.547]  Instead of the vaccines we're actually getting, because the vaccines we're actually getting are things like dropping vaccines for coyotes and rabbits and skunks and turtles.
[00:19:01.547 --> 00:19:03.647]  Now they're actually dropping them on wildlife.
[00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:05.808]  So here are the top 10 vaccines that we really need.
[00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:06.128]  Go ahead.
[00:19:10.512 --> 00:19:13.314]  Got that music?
[00:19:13.314 --> 00:19:14.535]  Nope.
[00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:16.296]  Yeah, it's coming up.
[00:19:16.296 --> 00:19:17.557]  It's coming up shortly.
[00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:22.441]  All right, until we get to that, we've got, let's go to the UK has run out of money.
[00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:27.945]  George Osborne says, obviously he's the Chancellor, he says next month's budget has run out of money.
[00:19:27.945 --> 00:19:34.109]  Quote, the British government has run out of money because all the money was spent in the good years.
[00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:34.790]  What do we got here?
[00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.050]  Okay.
[00:19:36.727 --> 00:19:37.367]  All right.
[00:19:37.367 --> 00:19:40.850]  The money and investments in the jobs need to come from the private sector, he says now.
[00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.051]  Can you imagine that?
[00:19:42.051 --> 00:19:44.512]  The private sector, you mean, might be our savior for the budget?
[00:19:44.512 --> 00:19:49.596]  We'll have more on that and plus the top ten vaccines we really need, as I promised.
[00:19:49.596 --> 00:19:52.117]  We'll be rolling with that on the other side of this break.
[00:19:52.117 --> 00:19:54.339]  We've got a lot more coming up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:54.339 --> 00:19:55.239]  Stay with us.

[00:21:31.495 --> 00:21:36.058]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.058 --> 00:21:41.862]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.862 --> 00:21:45.504]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:05.371]  In the past, I've taken a lot of different vitamins, some through health food stores, some that friends recommend.
[00:23:05.371 --> 00:23:08.352]  Colleen, talking about her experience with Super C-Veg.
[00:23:08.352 --> 00:23:11.272]  And with the Super C-Veg, I was seeing a lot better results.
[00:23:11.272 --> 00:23:18.534]  Super C-Veg with Vita-D and C-Cal is the most powerful dietary food supplement in the world today, and nothing else comes close.
[00:23:18.534 --> 00:23:22.375]  Super C-Veg is a whole food that makes me feel good.
[00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:24.755]  Think of Super C-Veg as the un-vitamin.
[00:23:24.915 --> 00:23:27.917]  I have taken other things and they just didn't work.
[00:23:27.917 --> 00:23:29.198]  This seems to work for me.

[00:23:54.918 --> 00:23:57.720]  Eating Super C-Veg Daily is eating right!
[00:24:08.772 --> 00:24:11.874]  Yeah, there's all kinds of crazy breaking news today, as usual.
[00:24:11.874 --> 00:24:18.979]  We've got the school shooting that we already mentioned, which again, the mainstream hoax media will try to use that to blame it on guns.
[00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:36.250]  And in fact, we're going to cover that issue that Alex talked about yesterday, about the schoolgirl, the four-year-old who drew a picture of her dad with a gun, and then the police arrested the man and strip-searched him, saying that he was being arrested for possession, illegal possession of a firearm.
[00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.291]  What if her dad was a cop?
[00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:40.568]  You know, what if her dad was a fireman and she drew an axe?
[00:24:40.568 --> 00:24:50.157]  Or what if her dad was a paramedic and she drew a picture of a knife that you use to rescue people when they're stuck in their seatbelts in their cars?
[00:24:50.157 --> 00:24:52.159]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:56.163]  We'll get more into that later, but let's go to the top 10 things we really need a vaccine for.
[00:24:56.163 --> 00:25:01.508]  This should be fun and interesting, and this is a little comedy bit about vaccines that we do need instead of the ones they give us.
[00:25:01.508 --> 00:25:02.089]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:25:04.113 --> 00:25:08.776]  Number one, we need a vaccine for resisting mass media brainwashing, the CNN jab.
[00:25:08.776 --> 00:25:11.478]  Instead of the MMR, we just call it the CNN.
[00:25:11.478 --> 00:25:13.219]  Did you get your CNN yet?
[00:25:13.219 --> 00:25:21.964]  Number two, we need a vaccine that blocks the toxic effects of BPA, the hormone mimicking plastics chemical that creates man boobs in those who eat too much of it.
[00:25:21.964 --> 00:25:29.349]  Number three, we need a vaccine that shields us from the magical, paralyzing hideousness of Janet Napolitano's face, like the Medusa.
[00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:35.432]  Number four, we need a vaccine that protects us from the brain damaging metals found in vaccines.
[00:25:35.432 --> 00:25:41.996]  So before you get your flu shot, you first get your aluminum vaccine so that you're immune to the aluminum in the flu shot.
[00:25:41.996 --> 00:25:49.821]  Number five, we need a vaccine that boosts immune defenses against GMOs and causes you to just involuntarily chuck those GMOs right back up.
[00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:52.463]  Hey grocery manager, can I get my money back on this?
[00:25:53.323 --> 00:26:01.931]  Number six, we need a vaccine that we can give the vaccine pimping doctors that will cure them of being total big pharma whore zombies.
[00:26:01.931 --> 00:26:05.795]  Number seven, we need a vaccine that can help you find a parking spot.
[00:26:05.795 --> 00:26:10.580]  Yeah, take the shot, find your spot, you get the jab if you need it or not.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.704]  Number eight, how about having a vaccine that simply protects people from being total morons when they vote.
[00:26:16.365 --> 00:26:22.872]  It would activate extra brain cells before anybody punches a hanging Chad and accidentally votes for Obama again.
[00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:24.113]  Oh no!
[00:26:24.113 --> 00:26:28.677]  Number nine, we need a mental vaccine that protects people from false authority brainwashing.
[00:26:28.677 --> 00:26:34.023]  So when the government screams, give up your rights to be safe from terrorism, your brain goes, huh?
[00:26:34.023 --> 00:26:36.485]  But the government created the terrorism.
[00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:36.785]  Weird.
[00:26:37.446 --> 00:26:38.286]  Number 10.
[00:26:38.286 --> 00:26:42.487]  We need a mandatory vaccine for politicians that makes them tell the truth.
[00:26:42.487 --> 00:26:44.908]  Mr. Obama, are you an American citizen?
[00:26:44.908 --> 00:26:45.608]  No.
[00:26:45.608 --> 00:26:47.908]  Mr. Bernanke, are you trying to destroy the U.S.
[00:26:47.908 --> 00:26:48.809]  economy?
[00:26:48.809 --> 00:26:49.749]  Yes.
[00:26:49.749 --> 00:26:56.170]  Mr. Romney, are you taking orders from sychanic aliens who are trying to geoengineer the planet for extraterrestrial colonization?
[00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:56.690]  Yes!
[00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.670]  Yes!
[00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:58.011]  Yes!
[00:27:00.411 --> 00:27:01.692]  There you go.
[00:27:01.692 --> 00:27:04.594]  That's the top ten vaccines we really need.
[00:27:04.594 --> 00:27:07.837]  My apologies to all those celebrities named in that bid.
[00:27:07.837 --> 00:27:09.698]  It's obviously satire and humor.
[00:27:09.698 --> 00:27:10.518]  Hope you enjoyed it.
[00:27:10.518 --> 00:27:14.781]  Now we do have more humor coming up at the bottom of the hour, but of course there's a serious message.
[00:27:14.781 --> 00:27:17.784]  Every time we do satire, we're expressing our First Amendment rights.
[00:27:18.464 --> 00:27:28.672]  We do cover real issues in that so the issue obviously that we're reflecting in that is that we have vaccines for all these silly things like a salmonella and and like the measles or chicken pox.
[00:27:28.672 --> 00:27:33.696]  Remember when you used to just get the chicken pox and you and then you overcame it and you were perfectly fine and you never get it again?
[00:27:34.176 --> 00:27:38.719]  Now they have chicken pox vaccines because apparently there's something wrong with getting the chicken pox.
[00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:45.002]  No, that is practice for your immune system to be strong, to get the chicken pox, to get the measles.
[00:27:45.002 --> 00:27:51.586]  A healthy body can throw off those infections without any problem, just like I'm throwing off a slight infection today, you know?
[00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:53.747]  Immune system is working just fine, getting some practice.
[00:27:53.747 --> 00:27:58.949]  It's like going to the gym and working out with some weights to build up your musculature, right?
[00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:00.710]  It's just good practice.
[00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.912]  What's wrong with practicing your immune system?
[00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:03.152]  All right.
[00:28:04.278 --> 00:28:07.700]  By the way, vaccines are marketed much like terrorism.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.901]  Have you ever noticed that?
[00:28:08.901 --> 00:28:11.303]  It's designed to scare you into compliance.
[00:28:11.303 --> 00:28:14.846]  Like terrorism, they say, oh, today's a yellow alert, or orange alert, or red alert.
[00:28:14.846 --> 00:28:16.106]  It's designed to scare you.
[00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:22.091]  Oh, Iran might have enough material to develop a bomb, and they're going to bomb the Statue of Liberty, all this other nonsense.
[00:28:22.091 --> 00:28:25.613]  Vaccines are promoted with the exact same kind of warped logic.
[00:28:25.613 --> 00:28:27.655]  Oh, there's been an outbreak.
[00:28:27.655 --> 00:28:32.118]  Seven children in a school got measles, so all the unvaccinated kids have to be sent home.
[00:28:33.183 --> 00:28:34.423]  Wait a minute.
[00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:38.565]  If vaccines protect the vaccinated kids, why are they afraid of the unvaccinated kids?
[00:28:38.565 --> 00:28:39.105]  Tell me that again.
[00:28:39.105 --> 00:28:44.187]  And if you check the outbreak, it happened among those who were vaccinated.
[00:28:44.187 --> 00:28:48.588]  See, that's the other thing the mainstream media, hoax media, never tells you.
[00:28:48.588 --> 00:28:52.730]  Every one of these outbreaks happens among children who have been vaccinated.
[00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.831]  When there's a measles outbreak, it's children who are vaccinated against the measles.
[00:28:56.519 --> 00:29:00.885]  When there's a chickenpox outbreak, it's often children who are vaccinated against chickenpox.
[00:29:00.885 --> 00:29:02.387]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:29:02.387 --> 00:29:06.132]  When there's a flu outbreak, it's among those who are vaccinated against the flu.
[00:29:06.132 --> 00:29:07.633]  So, you see their logic just never holds up.
[00:29:11.769 --> 00:29:12.790]  We have time for this?
[00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.271]  Oh man, the drones.
[00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:18.152]  Not that much time, I know, but we gotta get into this.
[00:29:18.152 --> 00:29:33.280]  I'll tell you, I'll get into this more at the top of the next hour, but the Federal Aviation Administration has announced a timeline now where they're going to have drones flying all over the skies of America for police stations and fire stations and even, you know, traffic control.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.761]  Yeah, it's all about spying on you.
[00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:36.342]  You know that.
[00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:39.143]  We'll give you that news coming up.
[00:29:39.143 --> 00:29:48.788]  Plus, a sound bit from Patty Finn, an attorney who is being tyrannized by the government for her anti-vaccination legal actions.
[00:29:48.788 --> 00:29:50.069]  Much more coming up.
[00:29:50.069 --> 00:29:51.470]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.991]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.991 --> 00:29:56.653]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.283 --> 00:30:06.268]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[00:30:06.268 --> 00:30:18.799]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.

[00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.151]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:04.514]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:31:04.514 --> 00:31:07.638]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:07.638 --> 00:31:12.464]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:12.464 --> 00:31:18.852]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:31:19.312 --> 00:31:30.541]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:35.005]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:31:35.005 --> 00:31:41.270]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.431]  Now that's results.

[00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:12.756]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:21.483]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:21.483 --> 00:32:25.566]  They soak pride in every stitch.

[00:32:55.794 --> 00:32:57.375]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.155]  Got it.
[00:32:58.155 --> 00:32:58.976]  Others don't.
[00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:26.534]  Alright, welcome back on this Monday, February 27th, 2012.
[00:33:26.534 --> 00:33:31.097]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.097 --> 00:33:38.941]  We've got Ian Varela, a ventriloquist here, joining us in the studio for the next segment.
[00:33:38.941 --> 00:33:40.441]  Hold on a second.
[00:33:40.441 --> 00:33:44.243]  He's got his character, Old Man Gramps, who's going crazy over here.
[00:33:44.243 --> 00:33:47.785]  Apparently Old Man Gramps... I am not happy.
[00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:51.008]  Yeah, apparently he's not.
[00:33:51.008 --> 00:33:53.089]  Anyway, we want to welcome Ian to the show.
[00:33:53.089 --> 00:33:58.751]  He's live here in studio, and for those of you on the radio, you'll be able to hear his character voice.
[00:33:58.751 --> 00:34:03.773]  For those of you watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you'll be able to see the comedy and Ian's website.
[00:34:08.814 --> 00:34:09.774]  Very good.
[00:34:09.774 --> 00:34:12.916]  The website for Ian is ComedyVent.com.
[00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:15.077]  Comedy Vent, short for Ventriloquist.
[00:34:15.077 --> 00:34:16.837]  Comedy Ventriloquist.
[00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:17.618]  It's hard to say.
[00:34:17.618 --> 00:34:18.998]  Stop moving your lips.
[00:34:18.998 --> 00:34:20.319]  You say it then, I'll say it.
[00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:22.099]  Alright, so old man Gramps.
[00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:22.720]  Yeah?
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.921]  Are you, you're a farmer from Central Texas?
[00:34:25.921 --> 00:34:26.421]  What's your deal?
[00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:27.342]  Where are you from?
[00:34:27.342 --> 00:34:28.942]  I'm a chicken farmer.
[00:34:28.942 --> 00:34:29.602]  Chicken farmer.
[00:34:29.602 --> 00:34:33.284]  Chicken farmer from San Antonio.
[00:34:33.284 --> 00:34:34.985]  Oh yeah.
[00:34:34.985 --> 00:34:35.805]  Yeah.
[00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:37.646]  Lost a lot of chickens last year.
[00:34:39.236 --> 00:34:39.917]  What happened?
[00:34:39.917 --> 00:34:41.698]  I think I planned too deep.
[00:34:41.698 --> 00:34:42.699]  You planned too deep?
[00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.140]  Yeah.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.181]  That's horrible.
[00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:45.621]  I know.
[00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:49.084]  I should have planned farther apart.
[00:34:49.084 --> 00:34:49.724]  I don't know.
[00:34:49.724 --> 00:34:56.890]  Now, when we talked before the show, Gramps, you mentioned the government was giving you a hard time with some of your farming practices.
[00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:58.771]  What was going on with that?
[00:34:58.771 --> 00:35:03.235]  Oh, it's that darn Bud Light Lector.
[00:35:03.235 --> 00:35:05.757]  They're poisoning the chickens.
[00:35:05.757 --> 00:35:06.237]  What?
[00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:07.898]  They're poisoning the chickens.
[00:35:07.898 --> 00:35:08.238]  With what?
[00:35:08.999 --> 00:35:12.101]  Poison.
[00:35:12.101 --> 00:35:18.385]  I think that was the corn that... Oh, that genetically modified corn.
[00:35:18.385 --> 00:35:19.846]  Is that what it stands for?
[00:35:19.846 --> 00:35:21.607]  Yeah, GM corn.
[00:35:21.607 --> 00:35:25.810]  Oh, I thought that was a new car that General Motors was coming out with.
[00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:26.450]  No.
[00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.050]  No?
[00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.551]  No, we're not.
[00:35:28.407 --> 00:35:30.008]  Genetically mutated.
[00:35:30.008 --> 00:35:31.109]  Oh, it's different.
[00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.469]  Okay.
[00:35:31.469 --> 00:35:34.151]  So what happened to your chickens when they ate that GM corn?
[00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:42.416]  Well, I came back there and you know, it looked like the final scene from that movie, Scarface.
[00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:43.316]  What final scene?
[00:35:43.316 --> 00:35:47.279]  You know, the dead people all over the place.
[00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:49.080]  Come and meet my little friend.
[00:35:50.705 --> 00:35:52.506]  You, uh, horrible.
[00:35:52.506 --> 00:35:53.426]  What about the EPA?
[00:35:53.426 --> 00:35:56.627]  Do they leave you alone out there, or do they pretty much give you, uh... No!
[00:35:56.627 --> 00:36:00.248]  Gosh darn that, uh, that dust thing.
[00:36:00.248 --> 00:36:01.268]  Jeez.
[00:36:01.268 --> 00:36:02.888]  They don't even call it dust anymore.
[00:36:02.888 --> 00:36:04.149]  That's what they don't call it.
[00:36:04.149 --> 00:36:07.410]  They got a real fancy name for dust.
[00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:08.350]  What do they call it?
[00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:12.591]  Something that, uh, gosh, I wish I had my notes, of course, I had to, I had to...
[00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:16.113]  It's granulated particles.
[00:36:16.113 --> 00:36:17.193]  Granulated particles?
[00:36:17.193 --> 00:36:18.334]  Yeah, or something like that.
[00:36:18.334 --> 00:36:20.095]  What do you think about that?
[00:36:20.095 --> 00:36:24.378]  I think that's a big heap of post-digestive cattle feed.
[00:36:24.378 --> 00:36:27.179]  Wait a minute, where's the dust even coming from?
[00:36:27.179 --> 00:36:28.600]  From the tractor.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.802]  So you're driving a tractor, you're making dust, and the EPA's giving you a hard time?
[00:36:31.802 --> 00:36:34.724]  So now I need a new kind of tractor.
[00:36:34.724 --> 00:36:35.104]  What kind?
[00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:35.485]  Oric.
[00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:37.067]  What?
[00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:38.989]  Oric.
[00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:40.130]  The vacuum cleaner?
[00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.291]  You got to hit the filter.
[00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:45.674]  And what's an Oric tractor do?
[00:36:45.674 --> 00:36:49.056]  Less dust.
[00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:49.556]  I see.
[00:36:49.556 --> 00:36:50.657]  See?
[00:36:50.657 --> 00:36:51.038]  I see.
[00:36:51.038 --> 00:36:51.478]  Clever guy.
[00:36:51.878 --> 00:36:53.199]  I ain't tellin' ya.
[00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:55.560]  I got an answer for everything.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.782]  Alright, so you're into farming, you're into sustainable living, it sounds like.
[00:36:59.782 --> 00:37:00.922]  Yes.
[00:37:00.922 --> 00:37:02.323]  You into green living?
[00:37:02.323 --> 00:37:02.963]  Oh, sure.
[00:37:02.963 --> 00:37:07.986]  I got lots of, we got lots of weeds around our house.
[00:37:07.986 --> 00:37:10.407]  Being, you know, good to the environment.
[00:37:10.407 --> 00:37:12.648]  Oh, sure, yeah.
[00:37:12.648 --> 00:37:15.409]  Yeah, thanks for that genetically mutated corn there.
[00:37:15.409 --> 00:37:17.511]  Them chickens are so big, I don't need a car.
[00:37:17.511 --> 00:37:19.311]  I can just saddle up and ride into town.
[00:37:21.263 --> 00:37:23.064]  Okay, what about the economy?
[00:37:23.064 --> 00:37:26.164]  How's that affecting you out there in the farming operation?
[00:37:26.164 --> 00:37:27.385]  I'm telling you what.
[00:37:27.385 --> 00:37:31.986]  I know for Ron Paul, they're in that gold standard.
[00:37:31.986 --> 00:37:32.786]  Yeah, they should go back.
[00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:34.607]  They're going with the gold standard there.
[00:37:34.607 --> 00:37:38.288]  I went to Wal-Mart last week and they paid me in change.
[00:37:38.288 --> 00:37:39.308]  What kind of change?
[00:37:39.308 --> 00:37:41.089]  Yen.
[00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:42.249]  They paid me in yens.
[00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.372]  Is it increasing the cost of your farming practice?
[00:37:48.372 --> 00:37:50.153]  I mean, buying gas and things like that?
[00:37:50.153 --> 00:37:51.554]  Oh, gee, I'm telling you.
[00:37:51.554 --> 00:37:55.778]  $50 just to fill my tank.
[00:37:55.778 --> 00:37:56.819]  Wow.
[00:37:56.819 --> 00:37:59.421]  And that was just my lawnmower.
[00:37:59.421 --> 00:38:01.662]  Okay.
[00:38:01.662 --> 00:38:02.703]  All right.
[00:38:02.703 --> 00:38:04.665]  Maybe you need one of those plug-in tractors.
[00:38:04.665 --> 00:38:05.986]  Well, there you go.
[00:38:05.986 --> 00:38:07.007]  Hybrid tractors.
[00:38:07.007 --> 00:38:09.529]  I got to get a long enough cork because I got lots of acreage.
[00:38:11.195 --> 00:38:14.277]  All right, well, speaking of politics, you mentioned Ron Paul, you mentioned the Gold Standard.
[00:38:14.277 --> 00:38:20.020]  What do you think about the politicians vying for the Republican nomination right now?
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.501]  Oh, I hope they do something.
[00:38:21.501 --> 00:38:23.422]  I hope they deal with Rocky.
[00:38:23.422 --> 00:38:24.482]  Yeah, you don't like Rocky.
[00:38:24.482 --> 00:38:25.683]  I don't like him.
[00:38:25.683 --> 00:38:31.546]  I'm kind of glad he got elected, though, because it got him off my back.
[00:38:31.546 --> 00:38:32.227]  He was on your back?
[00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:32.987]  How was that?
[00:38:32.987 --> 00:38:35.568]  Every day, he's come up to me and asked me for change.
[00:38:38.826 --> 00:38:41.447]  I think that was his campaign slogan.
[00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:41.808]  Yeah.
[00:38:41.808 --> 00:38:43.168]  We need change.
[00:38:43.168 --> 00:38:45.569]  Oh, change from what?
[00:38:45.569 --> 00:38:46.630]  That's what I want to know.
[00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.731]  Well, not much has changed, actually.
[00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:50.692]  That's the bad part about it.
[00:38:50.692 --> 00:38:52.873]  What do you think about Mitt Romney?
[00:38:52.873 --> 00:38:53.153]  Mitt Romney.
[00:38:53.153 --> 00:38:54.134]  Mitt Romney.
[00:38:54.134 --> 00:38:54.914]  Mitt Romney.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:08.163]  I haven't really kept up too well in the news.
[00:39:08.163 --> 00:39:09.784]  What's up with Mitt Romney?
[00:39:09.784 --> 00:39:11.985]  Well, I mean, he's, you know, he's the latest globalist.
[00:39:11.985 --> 00:39:15.127]  He's sort of like Obama, but white.
[00:39:15.127 --> 00:39:17.989]  I mean, he's just the same policies, the same everything.
[00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:20.151]  Obama's not white?
[00:39:20.151 --> 00:39:22.412]  Oh, man.
[00:39:22.412 --> 00:39:26.555]  Okay, what about... He's half black, half Christian, half Muslim.
[00:39:29.376 --> 00:39:30.616]  What about Santorum?
[00:39:30.616 --> 00:39:38.998]  Oh, I tell ya, he's, uh... He is, uh... He is, uh... He doesn't watch the news very often.
[00:39:38.998 --> 00:39:41.838]  Sounds like Gramps has a little bit of an asthma problem.
[00:39:41.838 --> 00:39:51.220]  I got a little... I launched some medication there and it's making me kind of... kind of... Okay.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.180]  Not now.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.901]  Alright, so a little too much on the... Not now, Gladys.
[00:39:57.705 --> 00:39:58.886]  I did that last week.
[00:39:58.886 --> 00:40:00.206]  Get up!
[00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:01.187]  Rest in peace.
[00:40:01.187 --> 00:40:01.787]  I'm up!
[00:40:01.787 --> 00:40:03.969]  I'm up!
[00:40:03.969 --> 00:40:09.492]  Alright, so it sounds like he's got a medication benefit under Obamacare or something?
[00:40:09.492 --> 00:40:11.413]  Yeah, I've got me a health plan.
[00:40:11.413 --> 00:40:12.754]  What's your health plan, Grants?
[00:40:12.754 --> 00:40:16.896]  Don't get sick.
[00:40:16.896 --> 00:40:17.537]  Okay.
[00:40:17.537 --> 00:40:20.659]  I went to my doctor and he's trying to save money.
[00:40:20.659 --> 00:40:24.981]  I had a really bad cough, just like you did, and he gave me coughs.
[00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:26.122]  He gave me laxatives.
[00:40:27.185 --> 00:40:28.885]  Gives you laxative for your cough.
[00:40:28.885 --> 00:40:29.166]  Yeah.
[00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:30.626]  That makes you stop coughing?
[00:40:30.626 --> 00:40:33.727]  Makes you afraid to cough.
[00:40:33.727 --> 00:40:34.787]  Oh my.
[00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:36.528]  Oh my.
[00:40:36.528 --> 00:40:40.009]  Alright, Ian, let me ask you a question.
[00:40:40.009 --> 00:40:42.249]  Just me to you here for a second.
[00:40:42.249 --> 00:40:42.949]  Can I take a break?
[00:40:42.949 --> 00:40:44.150]  You can take a break.
[00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.850]  So, Gramps is one of your characters.
[00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.531]  You've got a number of characters.
[00:40:48.531 --> 00:40:52.052]  Can you describe some of the other characters?
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.880]  Oh, we got Alfred.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.641]  I hate that little... I know, I know.
[00:40:56.641 --> 00:40:57.901]  They don't get along too well.
[00:40:57.901 --> 00:40:59.742]  Alfred's kind of a Muppet-type character.
[00:40:59.742 --> 00:41:01.983]  He always gets me in lots of trouble.
[00:41:01.983 --> 00:41:06.224]  He got pulled over one time for speeding, and that's another show.
[00:41:06.224 --> 00:41:09.245]  But, uh, our fan says Sancho.
[00:41:09.245 --> 00:41:09.985]  Hi, Sancho!
[00:41:09.985 --> 00:41:11.905]  Yeah, he's from south of the border.
[00:41:11.905 --> 00:41:15.986]  He's from the capital of Mexico, Phoenix.
[00:41:15.986 --> 00:41:17.327]  And, uh, he's a...
[00:41:18.089 --> 00:41:22.252]  Do you find that people are really open to comedy right now these days?
[00:41:22.252 --> 00:41:26.174]  I mean, there's a lot of stress out there in the political environment and you're able to cover these topics.
[00:41:26.174 --> 00:41:27.956]  Oh, everybody needs a laugh.
[00:41:27.956 --> 00:41:28.936]  Especially now.
[00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:29.897]  Especially now.
[00:41:29.897 --> 00:41:34.120]  Alright, well going back to Gramps, so what are your plans, Gramps?
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.762]  Are you fighting back against the EPA on this dust issue?
[00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:41.445]  Yes, I'm fighting back on the EPA.
[00:41:41.445 --> 00:41:46.028]  They killed my chickens, so I'm going to get them back and take them all out to lunch.
[00:41:46.906 --> 00:41:47.586]  The EPA?
[00:41:47.586 --> 00:41:48.827]  Yeah!
[00:41:48.827 --> 00:41:49.487]  Where you going?
[00:41:49.487 --> 00:41:50.687]  Kentucky Fried Chicken!
[00:41:50.687 --> 00:41:53.348]  What do you think about this issue?
[00:41:53.348 --> 00:41:55.949]  A glass of milk!
[00:41:55.949 --> 00:41:59.111]  Mystery virus kills thousands of lambs in the UK.
[00:41:59.111 --> 00:42:00.511]  Look at that!
[00:42:00.511 --> 00:42:03.732]  Have you seen this issue?
[00:42:03.732 --> 00:42:06.393]  Because a lot of people socialize.
[00:42:06.393 --> 00:42:08.354]  Now, keep it cleaner.
[00:42:08.354 --> 00:42:12.916]  These lambs are being born with serious deformities such as fused limbs and twisted necks.
[00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:13.496]  Yes!
[00:42:14.636 --> 00:42:15.878]  Yeah, you know what they're gonna do?
[00:42:15.878 --> 00:42:19.684]  They're gonna... You know where virgin wool comes from, don't you?
[00:42:19.684 --> 00:42:20.725]  No.
[00:42:20.725 --> 00:42:22.368]  Ugly sheet.
[00:42:22.368 --> 00:42:23.750]  Oh my.
[00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:24.592]  Oh my.
[00:42:24.592 --> 00:42:28.157]  Apologize to our listeners for the off-color humor.
[00:42:28.157 --> 00:42:29.419]  It was not off-color!
[00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:31.664]  Alright, whatever you say, Gramps.
[00:42:31.664 --> 00:42:34.086]  Noland, Dirk, Thyrus, goodnight.
[00:42:34.086 --> 00:42:36.848]  Alright, so, what do you think the future of farming is in America, then?
[00:42:36.848 --> 00:42:41.291]  With all this oppression going on of farmers, what about the raw milk issue?
[00:42:41.291 --> 00:42:46.415]  The raw milk farmers are being arrested at gunpoint for milking their cows and trying to sell their milk.
[00:42:46.415 --> 00:42:46.915]  Really?
[00:42:46.915 --> 00:42:47.576]  Yeah!
[00:42:47.576 --> 00:42:48.456]  That happened to the Amish.
[00:42:48.456 --> 00:42:49.717]  You're not Amish, are you?
[00:42:49.717 --> 00:42:53.340]  Oh no, no, I'm on TV.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.221]  You know how the Amish catch a horse?
[00:42:56.715 --> 00:42:59.897]  They sneak up behind it and they build a barn around it.
[00:42:59.897 --> 00:43:02.098]  I didn't know that.
[00:43:02.098 --> 00:43:07.262]  Well, are you going to be at the Raw Milk Freedom event coming up later this week?
[00:43:07.262 --> 00:43:07.682]  Oh, Raw Milk!
[00:43:07.682 --> 00:43:08.402]  That's the good stuff.
[00:43:08.402 --> 00:43:11.064]  I'm going to bring a bucket or two.
[00:43:11.064 --> 00:43:12.085]  I got some vintage.
[00:43:12.085 --> 00:43:12.765]  That's good stuff.
[00:43:15.222 --> 00:43:18.064]  So he's uh, he's not really up to date on the Wal-Mart Freedom app.
[00:43:18.064 --> 00:43:20.186]  I'm not really up on these things, you know.
[00:43:20.186 --> 00:43:29.473]  I had a Wikileaks last week that I'm wearing to Penn's now, so I'm alright.
[00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:32.295]  Well, you are up on a ton of those Wikileaks did.
[00:43:32.295 --> 00:43:34.377]  That was breaking news today.
[00:43:34.377 --> 00:43:35.998]  Yeah!
[00:43:35.998 --> 00:43:37.620]  In fact... What happened?
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.180]  I missed it.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.982]  You gotta really get up on things.
[00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.231]  I guess so.
[00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:44.294]  Look who's working me.
[00:43:44.294 --> 00:43:44.615]  Alright.
[00:43:47.014 --> 00:43:48.895]  All right, so where are you playing, Ian?
[00:43:48.895 --> 00:43:52.737]  Where do you get Gramps out to talk to people about current events?
[00:43:52.737 --> 00:43:56.338]  A lot of our shows are private corporate shows for banquets.
[00:43:56.338 --> 00:44:00.700]  We did a show, it seems like a lot of the companies we're working for now used to be other companies.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.841]  And they got bought out.
[00:44:01.841 --> 00:44:05.062]  They got bought out and they have new merger names.
[00:44:05.062 --> 00:44:07.623]  We did a show for 3M.
[00:44:07.623 --> 00:44:09.624]  They just acquired Goodyear.
[00:44:09.624 --> 00:44:13.026]  And they got a great new, what's their new name?
[00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:13.406]  Good.
[00:44:13.406 --> 00:44:14.327]  That's right.
[00:44:15.808 --> 00:44:24.558]  Uh, the people who make great Poupon Mustard just bought out the Levi Strauss Corporation and their new name is, uh, Poupon Pants, actually.
[00:44:24.558 --> 00:44:28.342]  You ever do any events for, uh, globalist, elitist corporations?
[00:44:28.342 --> 00:44:29.764]  Rockefellers?
[00:44:29.764 --> 00:44:30.585]  Hell yeah!
[00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:32.567]  Gonsanto?
[00:44:32.567 --> 00:44:33.368]  DuPont?
[00:44:33.368 --> 00:44:33.568]  Nope!
[00:44:34.386 --> 00:44:40.230]  Well, so many, you know, it's really hard to keep track of what we've done.
[00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:44.893]  Yeah, we do a lot of work, and we're going to be in Louisville.
[00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:45.293]  Louisville?
[00:44:45.293 --> 00:44:47.975]  Louisville, we're doing a comedy club.
[00:44:47.975 --> 00:44:48.775]  Comedy club.
[00:44:48.775 --> 00:44:52.818]  Yes, sure, there's your comedy caravan the last weekend.
[00:44:52.818 --> 00:44:55.459]  For those listening, just let me give everybody an update.
[00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:56.680]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.521]  We've got a comedy ventriloquist on.
[00:44:58.521 --> 00:45:00.022]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:45:00.022 --> 00:45:01.023]  I'm Rush Limbaugh.
[00:45:01.023 --> 00:45:01.863]  No, you're not Rush Limbaugh.
[00:45:02.944 --> 00:45:13.034]  We've got Ian Varela here with his character, Old Man Gramps, who's got a lot of complaints about government intervention with his farming practices, apparently the EPA.
[00:45:13.034 --> 00:45:14.635]  And what about the USDA?
[00:45:14.635 --> 00:45:18.900]  You know, they approved genetically modified sugar beets.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.163]  Yeah, what is up with the sugar beets of all things?
[00:45:22.163 --> 00:45:26.107]  Well, I guess, you know, they wanted to grow more sugar with Roundup pesticide in it.
[00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:33.596]  Well no, it doesn't, but since when did GMOs make any sense?
[00:45:33.596 --> 00:45:35.336]  This is true, this is very true.
[00:45:35.336 --> 00:45:36.397]  I'm a simple farmer.
[00:45:36.397 --> 00:45:37.897]  You're a simple farmer.
[00:45:37.897 --> 00:45:41.318]  Last year I planted cabbage and razor blades.
[00:45:49.526 --> 00:45:50.787]  Why'd you plant razor blades?
[00:45:50.787 --> 00:45:52.368]  Coleslaw!
[00:45:52.368 --> 00:45:54.450]  Oh my.
[00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.951]  Oh my.
[00:45:55.951 --> 00:45:57.291]  Okay.
[00:45:57.291 --> 00:46:01.574]  Guys, you got any questions I need to ask old man Gramps here?
[00:46:01.574 --> 00:46:04.436]  We've got to feed him some good questions here.
[00:46:04.436 --> 00:46:06.197]  We have Gorkun in here, something's wrong.
[00:46:06.197 --> 00:46:06.838]  Oh my.
[00:46:06.838 --> 00:46:10.180]  Okay, what's your prediction for who's going to win the presidential election?
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.823]  Average Republican.
[00:46:13.823 --> 00:46:14.343]  Which one?
[00:46:14.343 --> 00:46:14.883]  Doesn't matter.
[00:46:17.612 --> 00:46:19.153]  And what about firearms?
[00:46:19.153 --> 00:46:22.795]  You know, firearms are being taken away all across the country now from people.
[00:46:22.795 --> 00:46:24.496]  You have a shotgun or something out there on your ranch?
[00:46:24.496 --> 00:46:25.076]  Sure do.
[00:46:25.076 --> 00:46:30.639]  I got me a shotgun there.
[00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:33.841]  I bought it when my daughter turned 16 and started dating.
[00:46:36.522 --> 00:46:41.985]  Yeah, that way I can have something to clean when the boyfriend comes over.
[00:46:41.985 --> 00:46:43.086]  Yeah!
[00:46:43.086 --> 00:46:46.328]  Alright, and what else are you into?
[00:46:46.328 --> 00:46:47.408]  You into Ron Paul?
[00:46:47.408 --> 00:46:48.169]  You into Liberty?
[00:46:48.169 --> 00:46:50.770]  I'm into Ron Paul and into rap music.
[00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:51.551]  Rap music?
[00:46:51.551 --> 00:46:52.331]  Really?
[00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:52.752]  Sure!
[00:46:52.752 --> 00:46:53.952]  Get out of here!
[00:46:53.952 --> 00:46:55.253]  Oh sure, I like that.
[00:46:55.253 --> 00:46:55.953]  I like that NNN.
[00:46:57.094 --> 00:46:57.615]  Eminem?
[00:46:57.615 --> 00:46:59.836]  Yeah, I like him.
[00:46:59.836 --> 00:47:00.857]  What do you like?
[00:47:00.857 --> 00:47:01.678]  What song do you like?
[00:47:01.678 --> 00:47:05.821]  You know that one that goes, you know, My name is what?
[00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:09.464]  My name is what?
[00:47:09.464 --> 00:47:10.324]  That's good!
[00:47:10.324 --> 00:47:11.445]  Yeah!
[00:47:11.445 --> 00:47:15.989]  Yeah, he's... I'm getting his cold.
[00:47:15.989 --> 00:47:16.829]  You're getting his cold.
[00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:19.652]  We're all getting your cold.
[00:47:19.652 --> 00:47:21.233]  I do country and rap.
[00:47:21.233 --> 00:47:21.873]  Country and rap?
[00:47:21.873 --> 00:47:22.614]  What's it called?
[00:47:22.614 --> 00:47:22.994]  Crap.
[00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:25.722]  Okay.
[00:47:25.722 --> 00:47:26.142]  All right.
[00:47:26.142 --> 00:47:31.226]  I apologize to the viewers again for the old man grabs.
[00:47:31.226 --> 00:47:35.309]  He sort of wedged his way into the studio today and started ranting.
[00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:39.111]  You're sitting right on Alex's desk with your socks, no less.
[00:47:39.111 --> 00:47:39.912]  What's the deal with that?
[00:47:39.912 --> 00:47:41.253]  It's getting comfy.
[00:47:41.253 --> 00:47:44.455]  You must have all kinds of farm critters right there.
[00:47:44.455 --> 00:47:47.357]  Oh, I tell you what.
[00:47:47.357 --> 00:47:52.321]  We got horses and chickens and bulls.
[00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.671]  You do not want to try and milk that bull.
[00:47:55.671 --> 00:47:57.691]  You don't want to, no.
[00:47:57.691 --> 00:47:58.532]  Oh my gosh.
[00:47:58.532 --> 00:48:03.954]  Okay, I can just tell someone's going to be calling and screaming at me here in just a minute.
[00:48:03.954 --> 00:48:06.915]  Old Man Gramps, what's in your future?
[00:48:06.915 --> 00:48:08.955]  We've only got a couple minutes left.
[00:48:08.955 --> 00:48:12.897]  What do you want to set for the future here for farming in America?
[00:48:12.897 --> 00:48:15.698]  Have you lived in Centerville or San Antonio all your life?
[00:48:16.522 --> 00:48:19.744]  Not yet.
[00:48:19.744 --> 00:48:20.985]  You live in San Antonio?
[00:48:20.985 --> 00:48:24.347]  Oh, sure, I live there in San Antonio.
[00:48:24.347 --> 00:48:25.107]  Is it kind of dry?
[00:48:25.107 --> 00:48:26.528]  Kind of drought conditions there right now?
[00:48:26.528 --> 00:48:28.249]  I'm telling you, it's horrible.
[00:48:28.249 --> 00:48:29.450]  It's just horrible.
[00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:30.410]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.871]  And I'm getting audited, too.
[00:48:32.871 --> 00:48:33.992]  I'm angry.
[00:48:33.992 --> 00:48:35.413]  You're angry?
[00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:37.174]  Yeah.
[00:48:37.174 --> 00:48:38.955]  Did something put up a red flag?
[00:48:38.955 --> 00:48:39.956]  Yeah.
[00:48:39.956 --> 00:48:41.436]  What put up a red flag?
[00:48:41.436 --> 00:48:43.097]  I had money in my bank account.
[00:48:45.606 --> 00:48:47.247]  Oh my, oh my.
[00:48:47.247 --> 00:48:51.728]  Alright, Ian, your last name Varelli, Varella?
[00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:52.228]  Varella.
[00:48:52.228 --> 00:48:53.308]  Varella.
[00:48:53.308 --> 00:48:57.370]  Okay, Ian Varella, the website is ComedyVent.com.
[00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.711]  Did you mention the DVDs on sale?
[00:49:00.711 --> 00:49:01.211]  Thanks!
[00:49:01.211 --> 00:49:02.671]  Subtle, Graham, very subtle.
[00:49:02.671 --> 00:49:04.952]  Yeah, where is that, on eBay?

[00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:19.692]  You have like a devil and an angel character.
[00:49:19.692 --> 00:49:20.593]  Yes, we do.
[00:49:20.593 --> 00:49:22.874]  Do they talk to you too?
[00:49:22.874 --> 00:49:26.337]  They're always fighting.
[00:49:26.337 --> 00:49:27.958]  And what other characters do you have?
[00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:36.568]  We've got Graham's, we've got Sancho the Parrot, and the drawing board.
[00:49:36.568 --> 00:49:38.428]  Oh, that's a cool thing.
[00:49:38.428 --> 00:49:43.670]  Yeah, it's a board where we draw a face onto the board and it starts to move by itself.
[00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:45.510]  Well, last question for you.
[00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.971]  What do you think about free speech in America today?
[00:49:47.971 --> 00:49:49.331]  Here you are practicing free speech.
[00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:50.511]  Yes!
[00:49:50.511 --> 00:49:52.932]  We practice free speech right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:52.932 --> 00:49:56.253]  Are you a big defender of the Bill of Rights and free speech?
[00:49:56.693 --> 00:50:00.557]  I am a big dissenter of that and a gun-loth.
[00:50:00.557 --> 00:50:05.562]  I fight for my right to hunt in the city of San Antonio.
[00:50:05.562 --> 00:50:06.343]  In the city?
[00:50:06.343 --> 00:50:06.664]  The city.
[00:50:06.664 --> 00:50:09.406]  What are you hunting for in the city?
[00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:11.729]  Uh, liberals.
[00:50:11.729 --> 00:50:12.049]  Liberals.
[00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.111]  No, no, no.
[00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.915]  Austin.
[00:50:16.915 --> 00:50:19.418]  That's not okay.
[00:50:19.418 --> 00:50:21.661]  No, you can't say that on national radio.
[00:50:21.661 --> 00:50:24.704]  You have to be politically correct.
[00:50:24.704 --> 00:50:28.549]  That's taking the fifth.
[00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:29.510]  Yeah, the first amendment.
[00:50:31.924 --> 00:50:34.407]  All right, all right.
[00:50:34.407 --> 00:50:36.249]  We're going out now.
[00:50:36.249 --> 00:50:39.512]  I hope you enjoyed that segment with the Inverella and Old Man Gramps.
[00:50:39.512 --> 00:50:41.614]  Just a little bit of comic relief for you on this Monday.
[00:50:41.614 --> 00:50:46.639]  We'll come back with a lot more breaking news and guest Jonathan Emore to the top of the hour.

[00:50:49.642 --> 00:50:51.504]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex.
[00:50:51.504 --> 00:50:52.224]  Today, stay with us.
[00:50:52.224 --> 00:50:53.486]  We'll be right back after this break.

[00:52:00.757 --> 00:52:05.219]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:52:05.219 --> 00:52:06.700]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:15.603]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:52:15.603 --> 00:52:19.045]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:20.125]  But take heart.
[00:52:20.125 --> 00:52:23.887]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:52:23.887 --> 00:52:28.869]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:52:29.289 --> 00:52:33.111]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:34.832]  The globalists are scared.
[00:52:34.832 --> 00:52:36.173]  They've overreached.
[00:52:36.173 --> 00:52:39.694]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:52:44.977 --> 00:52:45.297]  We're good.
[00:53:03.476 --> 00:53:04.776]  Claire, it's Anne.
[00:53:04.776 --> 00:53:07.717]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:08.737]  The all-natural one.
[00:53:08.737 --> 00:53:09.197]  Ambrin?
[00:53:09.197 --> 00:53:10.638]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[00:53:10.638 --> 00:53:18.020]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.820]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:20.340]  It's gone.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.801]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[00:53:22.801 --> 00:53:23.461]  I feel great.
[00:53:23.461 --> 00:53:24.121]  Give me a call.
[00:53:24.281 --> 00:53:27.943]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:53:27.943 --> 00:53:31.745]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[00:53:31.745 --> 00:53:36.148]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[00:53:36.148 --> 00:53:38.489]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:53:38.489 --> 00:53:41.550]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:46.013]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.
[00:53:46.013 --> 00:53:51.416]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now and they'll send you a complimentary risk-free trial with a 30-day supply.

[00:53:52.637 --> 00:53:52.697]  1-800-839-2959.
[00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:18.442]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:18.442 --> 00:54:20.403]  Welcome for just joining us.
[00:54:20.403 --> 00:54:23.484]  Thanks for joining us on this Monday.
[00:54:23.484 --> 00:54:31.848]  We've got breaking news about an attorney who's being attacked for her position on vaccine rights for parents.
[00:54:31.848 --> 00:54:33.029]  This is big breaking news.
[00:54:33.029 --> 00:54:37.130]  We've got an exclusive audio bit coming up.
[00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.711]  Her name is Patty Finn.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:49.181]  And she was served with papers to suspend her license to practice law.
[00:54:49.181 --> 00:54:56.663]  Charges have been filed against her because of her address to the parental rights rally in West Virginia.
[00:54:56.663 --> 00:55:02.684]  She is also being ordered to disclose the names of the people she represents who do not vaccinate.
[00:55:02.684 --> 00:55:06.925]  Now, I hope you realize the enormity of this announcement, all right?
[00:55:06.925 --> 00:55:09.325]  This is an attorney, a licensed attorney in West Virginia.
[00:55:10.865 --> 00:55:21.438]  Who is helping parents protect their rights to not vaccinate their children from these vaccines that admittedly cause seizures and cause comas, sometimes can even cause death in many cases.
[00:55:22.566 --> 00:55:24.987]  And Patty is helping them protect their rights.
[00:55:24.987 --> 00:55:29.909]  She is now being absolutely, or I'm sorry, Patricia Finn is her name, or Patty.
[00:55:29.909 --> 00:55:33.291]  She's being absolutely attacked by the establishment.
[00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:39.154]  They're trying to take away her license and they're trying to force her to disclose the names of her clients.
[00:55:39.154 --> 00:55:41.955]  What about attorney-client privilege?
[00:55:41.955 --> 00:55:45.676]  And what about the rule of law in this country?
[00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:48.798]  She says she refuses to disclose the names of her clients.
[00:55:48.798 --> 00:55:50.919]  She says she'll go to jail first before giving out the names.
[00:55:52.151 --> 00:56:01.217]  And we have an audio clip, an interview that was just conducted today between Robert Scott Bell and Patricia Finn.
[00:56:01.217 --> 00:56:02.238]  Go ahead and roll that audio, please.
[00:56:04.167 --> 00:56:06.268]  I'm being monitored on the internet.
[00:56:06.268 --> 00:56:15.114]  My address on Wednesday before the We the Parents rally in West Virginia was very well advertised on the internet.
[00:56:15.114 --> 00:56:31.945]  And sure enough, when I was leaving to go there, I got served with a complaint saying that I lied about the number of people I represent, the nature of my work, and they want the names and addresses and the details of the parents who do not vaccinate.
[00:56:31.945 --> 00:56:33.466]  And I will tell you that
[00:56:34.346 --> 00:56:36.408]  They have taken everything from me.
[00:56:36.408 --> 00:56:38.410]  I can barely make a living.
[00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.111]  I can't pay my mortgage.
[00:56:40.111 --> 00:56:44.375]  I have lawyers who work for me that haven't been paid for weeks.
[00:56:44.375 --> 00:56:46.857]  They're absolutely torturing me.
[00:56:46.857 --> 00:56:49.459]  And my license is coveted.
[00:56:49.459 --> 00:56:51.881]  It means a lot to me, and I don't want to lose it.
[00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:55.684]  But, you know, 70% of lawyers are out of work in New York State.
[00:56:55.684 --> 00:56:57.386]  You know, they could take my license.
[00:56:57.386 --> 00:57:01.009]  I'll hire an attorney for $10 an hour to do what I'm doing.
[00:57:01.717 --> 00:57:05.299]  And I hate to sound so glib, but I'm done.
[00:57:05.299 --> 00:57:06.239]  Gloves are off.
[00:57:06.239 --> 00:57:07.459]  You know, bring it on.
[00:57:07.459 --> 00:57:17.343]  They came to my house to serve me with papers because I filed a lawsuit to protect my rights, to stop them from doing this to me.
[00:57:17.343 --> 00:57:20.605]  And while I was in West Virginia, they were in my office.
[00:57:20.605 --> 00:57:22.725]  They were talking to my neighbors.
[00:57:22.725 --> 00:57:24.146]  They were talking to my tenants.
[00:57:24.833 --> 00:57:32.083]  Talking of my children, when I got home, my son gave me a business card from the 9th Judicial District Investigator looking for me.
[00:57:32.083 --> 00:57:32.344]  Why?
[00:57:32.344 --> 00:57:35.488]  Because I filed a lawsuit years ago.
[00:57:35.488 --> 00:57:36.609]  I would have been afraid.
[00:57:36.609 --> 00:57:38.592]  And, you know, I'm not.
[00:57:38.592 --> 00:57:40.675]  And for that, I'm truly grateful.
[00:57:40.675 --> 00:57:41.216]  I'm not afraid.
[00:57:41.556 --> 00:57:53.540]  That's Patricia Finn, the attorney in West Virginia, who is now being just completely attacked for her position on defending the rights of parents to protect their children from vaccination.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:58:03.103]  This harassment is being called the Wakefield effect, obviously referring to Dr. Andrew Wakefield, whose career was completely destroyed.
[00:58:03.103 --> 00:58:04.764]  His medical license was stripped from him.
[00:58:05.504 --> 00:58:15.555]  Because he dared to question the false, fabricated science of the status quo in relation to how vaccines alter the health of children.
[00:58:15.555 --> 00:58:19.359]  Now, we've got much more news coming up here.
[00:58:19.359 --> 00:58:23.483]  Also tonight on InfoWars Nightly News, an interview with Patty Finn, so be sure to check that out.
[00:58:24.477 --> 00:58:25.938]  On InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:25.938 --> 00:58:33.586]  A lot more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show, including an interview with Jonathan E. Mord, author and health freedom advocate.
[00:58:33.586 --> 00:58:36.288]  Check all that straight ahead as you stay with us.
[00:58:36.288 --> 00:58:38.450]  We'll be right back after this break with much more.
[00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:43.575]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.575 --> 00:58:47.539]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.011 --> 00:58:53.733]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.733 --> 00:58:59.040]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.583]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.583 --> 00:59:09.374]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:10.095 --> 00:59:17.641]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:25.627]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.627 --> 00:59:30.871]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:33.033]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[00:59:33.513 --> 00:59:35.254]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:35.254 --> 00:59:36.955]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.386]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.386 --> 01:00:11.968]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.968 --> 01:00:13.530]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:17.715]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:21.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.060]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.061]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:28.061 --> 01:00:32.703]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in for Alex today, who is on the road.
[01:00:32.703 --> 01:00:39.365]  We are into our second hour, and we're just breaking some major news here right now.
[01:00:39.365 --> 01:00:45.007]  National news being broken right here on InfoWars about attorney Patricia Finn.
[01:00:45.007 --> 01:00:46.708]  She's a West Virginia attorney.
[01:00:47.308 --> 01:00:52.631]  Who is now being attacked for helping to defend the rights of parents against vaccines.
[01:00:52.631 --> 01:00:58.014]  They're trying to strip away her license to practice law.
[01:00:58.014 --> 01:01:03.458]  And they're trying to force her to disclose the names of her clients who also refuse to vaccinate.
[01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:04.879]  This is total oppression.
[01:01:04.879 --> 01:01:06.339]  This is completely unlawful.
[01:01:06.339 --> 01:01:11.863]  This is yet another example of the way the state is practicing what I call gunpoint medicine.
[01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:19.971]  Or they will actually bring guns and rifles and stick them in your face and force you to do what they say you should do for your children.
[01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:28.940]  And if you refuse to do that, then they will of course call the Communist Pedophile Services, CPS, to come take your children away at gunpoint.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.703]  Or they will force your children to undergo chemotherapy at gunpoint.
[01:01:32.575 --> 01:01:35.017]  Or, vaccination at gunpoint.
[01:01:35.017 --> 01:01:37.178]  And I do mean that literally, at gunpoint.
[01:01:37.178 --> 01:01:51.488]  For example, in, what was it, Maryland, just a couple years ago, they had attack dogs outside the courthouse where they had a long line of parents lined up there with police and militant-looking enforcers everywhere to force them to vaccinate their children.
[01:01:51.488 --> 01:01:53.530]  They're going after everybody.
[01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:53.890]  Why?
[01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:57.112]  Because of course vaccines are part of the depopulation agenda.
[01:01:57.112 --> 01:01:58.133]  It's all part of eugenics.
[01:01:59.412 --> 01:02:08.738]  And they know that the more people they can vaccinate, the more infertility they're going to cause, the more children they're going to kill, and the more future medical business they can generate from that.
[01:02:08.738 --> 01:02:16.163]  Because vaccines do cause kidney failure, they do cause liver damage, they do cause neurological damage, they cause autism.
[01:02:16.163 --> 01:02:19.465]  They may not be the only cause of autism, but they're certainly correlated with autism.
[01:02:19.465 --> 01:02:23.308]  And the evidence just keeps coming out, showing that vaccines are increasingly dangerous.
[01:02:23.308 --> 01:02:24.669]  Now, we've got other news.
[01:02:26.127 --> 01:02:30.269]  WikiLeaks has published Security Think Tank emails.
[01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:34.892]  This is from the anonymous hacker group that broke into Stratfor.
[01:02:34.892 --> 01:02:39.094]  Stratfor is the intelligence organization based right here in Austin, it turns out.
[01:02:40.225 --> 01:02:41.066]  That's right.
[01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:09.593]  I don't
[01:03:24.196 --> 01:03:27.018]  In this glossary, they're describing different agencies and different terms.
[01:03:27.018 --> 01:03:27.999]  They're defining terminology.
[01:03:27.999 --> 01:03:37.709]  They describe the ATF, for example, as, quote, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, rednecks with a license to kill, never ever ask for their help on anything.
[01:03:37.709 --> 01:03:41.012]  This is right out of the Stratfor glossary.
[01:03:41.012 --> 01:03:47.018]  Moving on, duplicitous little bastards is a term they define as, quote, Israeli intelligence.
[01:03:47.915 --> 01:03:54.736]  They also define the FBI as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, also known as the Downtown Gang.
[01:03:54.736 --> 01:03:57.257]  Very good at breaking up used car rings.
[01:03:57.257 --> 01:03:59.998]  Kind of confused on anything more complicated.
[01:03:59.998 --> 01:04:03.398]  Fun to jerk with, not fun when they jerk back.
[01:04:03.398 --> 01:04:07.559]  Again, this is the Stratfor glossary that has been leaked by WikiLeaks.
[01:04:07.559 --> 01:04:11.380]  This is the kind of documentation that many of the intel insiders get their hands on.
[01:04:12.652 --> 01:04:19.596]  They define intelligence officer as, quote, an individual charged with overseeing all aspects of an intelligence operation.
[01:04:19.596 --> 01:04:22.898]  Senior intelligence officers can manage multiple operations.
[01:04:22.898 --> 01:04:28.462]  Chief intelligence officers manage thousands of operations, all leading to disaster.
[01:04:28.462 --> 01:04:29.883]  Those are their own words.
[01:04:29.883 --> 01:04:41.610]  JTTF, Joint Terrorism Task Force, an interagency group created to completely confuse all conceivable issues related to terrorism in a variety of metropolitan areas.
[01:04:42.622 --> 01:04:47.865]  We've got more terms coming up from that leaked glossary, plus an interview with Jonathan Emord.
[01:04:47.865 --> 01:04:50.026]  Straight ahead, stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:50.026 --> 01:04:52.127]  We'll be right back with a lot more.
[01:04:52.127 --> 01:04:52.547]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.973 --> 01:05:08.217]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:05:08.217 --> 01:05:26.108]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:05:26.108 --> 01:05:30.210]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:32.251]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:05:32.251 --> 01:05:40.417]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:07:00.609 --> 01:07:05.151]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:06.071]  Number one.
[01:07:06.071 --> 01:07:09.492]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:10.352]  Number two.
[01:07:10.352 --> 01:07:15.254]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:15.254 --> 01:07:15.994]  It's true.
[01:07:15.994 --> 01:07:20.536]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.856 --> 01:07:21.676]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.676 --> 01:07:25.258]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:29.180]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:29.980]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.742]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.742 --> 01:07:36.423]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.423 --> 01:07:37.204]  Number 5.
[01:07:37.204 --> 01:07:41.346]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.346 --> 01:07:46.108]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.408 --> 01:07:50.570]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:52.371]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:52.371 --> 01:07:54.612]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:07:57.213 --> 01:08:06.378]  This communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.378 --> 01:08:08.659]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:15.774 --> 01:08:23.923]  We were just talking about some of the terminology in the Stratfor Glossary that has been leaked, uh, leaked, excuse me, by Wikileaks.
[01:08:23.923 --> 01:08:32.692]  This was some of the material that was, shall we, shall we say, uh, lifted from, from Stratfor by Anonymous, the hacker group.
[01:08:33.854 --> 01:08:35.435]  And I'm just going to continue with a couple points there.
[01:08:35.435 --> 01:08:39.699]  And then we're going to be joined by Jonathan Emord with his new book called Restoring the Republic.
[01:08:39.699 --> 01:08:43.863]  A very important book with a forward written by Ron Paul.
[01:08:43.863 --> 01:08:45.884]  We'll get to him in just a second, but let me just finish this up.
[01:08:45.884 --> 01:08:49.467]  I'm sure Jonathan Emord, who's listening on the phone, will have a good laugh at this.
[01:08:50.268 --> 01:09:00.011]  The glossary from Stratfor says a PowerPoint presentation is an efficient means for turning complex and sophisticated analysis into half-witted bullets.
[01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:04.973]  If you can't read a 50-page analysis before invading a country, you probably shouldn't be in the business.
[01:09:04.973 --> 01:09:13.556]  And then they have a term, a PowerPoint ranger is a member of an intelligence team whose primary contribution is making PowerPoint presentations.
[01:09:13.556 --> 01:09:17.277]  Usually assigned to the least competent member of the team to keep them out of trouble,
[01:09:17.897 --> 01:09:23.627]  Who winds up controlling the operation because management keeps promoting him because he makes neat animations.
[01:09:27.532 --> 01:09:35.278]  One last one, they define the Secret Service as a group that, quote, catches counterfeiters, breaks up child pornography rings, and guards the president.
[01:09:35.278 --> 01:09:38.060]  Continual identity crisis, they say.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.381]  Very nice people.
[01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:42.804]  Not, shall we say, the most sophisticated crew you'll ever find.
[01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:46.487]  Again, these are the words of Stratfor and their glossary, which has been leaked.
[01:09:46.487 --> 01:09:55.834]  A lot more leaked emails coming out, no doubt, in the next few days from Wikileaks, who continues to pummel the global elite with all kinds of liberated information.
[01:09:56.826 --> 01:10:01.390]  Now before we go to Jonathan Emore, I want to encourage you to take advantage of the Alex Jones Everything Special.
[01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:03.172]  It's only two more days.
[01:10:03.172 --> 01:10:05.234]  If you haven't taken advantage of this, do it now.
[01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:14.543]  For the next two days, you can get over $379 worth of all the films, all the DVDs, everything that Alex Jones has produced in film format.
[01:10:15.123 --> 01:10:31.629]  For just $19.95, plus you'll get Invisible Empire, plus Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, Fall of the Republic, The Presidency of Barack Obama, The Obama Deception, The 9-11 Chronicles Part 1, and much more.
[01:10:33.932 --> 01:10:41.238]  Right around Christmas, I came in here and bought that myself because I wanted to have that on DVD as well.
[01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:43.961]  Remember, they can take any of this off the internet at any time.
[01:10:43.961 --> 01:10:47.183]  So if you want to have the DVDs, get your hands on this special.
[01:10:47.183 --> 01:10:48.564]  Again, two days only.
[01:10:48.564 --> 01:10:49.645]  That's what's remaining.
[01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:53.829]  Go to InfoWars.com to get this special.
[01:10:53.829 --> 01:10:58.973]  Is there a special URL beyond that or is it just InfoWars.com?
[01:10:58.973 --> 01:10:59.674]  InfoWars.com.
[01:11:00.987 --> 01:11:01.808]  It's in the store.
[01:11:01.808 --> 01:11:03.170]  Click on the store once you get there.
[01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:04.291]  InfoWars.com.
[01:11:04.291 --> 01:11:11.480]  Alright, now we're joined by Jonathan Emord, who is really, I believe, one of the most important voices in our Republic.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.043]  He has defeated the FDA in court.
[01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:20.451]  He has written numerous books, some of which are on my top list of most important books in the health freedom movement.
[01:11:21.071 --> 01:11:21.451]  Mike, I'm here.
[01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:22.112]  Good to be with you.
[01:11:47.475 --> 01:11:48.236]  All right.
[01:11:48.236 --> 01:11:50.097]  Well, Jonathan, it's great to have you on.
[01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:51.859]  I'm honored to have you as a guest today.
[01:11:51.859 --> 01:11:55.802]  Thank you for your contributions, and I'm really excited about your new book.
[01:11:55.802 --> 01:11:58.624]  Well, thank you very much, and I'm excited about it as well.
[01:11:58.624 --> 01:11:59.525]  Well, tell us about it.
[01:11:59.525 --> 01:12:00.646]  Did I get the title right?
[01:12:00.646 --> 01:12:01.546]  Because it's brand new.
[01:12:01.546 --> 01:12:03.208]  Is it Restore the Republic?
[01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:06.450]  Restore the Republic.
[01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:08.812]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:12:08.812 --> 01:12:12.235]  Give us an overview of what's covered there.
[01:12:12.235 --> 01:12:13.056]  Did we lose Jonathan there?
[01:12:13.953 --> 01:12:14.133]  Okay.
[01:12:14.133 --> 01:12:20.555]  It's available through a secure link on emore.com concerning the destruction of all of our rights base.
[01:12:20.555 --> 01:12:22.115]  All right.
[01:12:22.115 --> 01:12:23.115]  Am I, am I here?
[01:12:23.115 --> 01:12:23.335]  Yeah.
[01:12:23.335 --> 01:12:25.736]  We, we, uh, restore the Republic.
[01:12:25.736 --> 01:12:40.039]  Unfortunately, um, uh, for the nation, um, the, uh, the entire rights basis of this country, all of the power limiting doctrines that are imposed on the federal government by the founding fathers have been stripped from the constitution.
[01:12:40.839 --> 01:13:05.359]  For the past 75 years, beginning primarily during the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s, the government has consistently violated the constitutional limitations on power, so much so that it has transformed the United States from a limited federal republic into an unlimited bureaucratic oligarchy.
[01:13:05.359 --> 01:13:08.962]  Nine-tenths of all federal law is now the product of those who are not elected,
[01:13:09.462 --> 01:13:23.437]  Who run the independent regulatory commissions and the effect of this is profound in reducing protection for individual liberty and enabling the government to replace individuals as sovereign and the book chronicles this.
[01:13:23.437 --> 01:13:27.381]  Let's talk about some, I'm sorry to interrupt, but some specific examples of that Jonathan.
[01:13:27.381 --> 01:13:28.082]  Could you go into those?
[01:13:28.082 --> 01:13:29.123]  For example, the ATF.
[01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:37.338]  Telling gun shops that they have to report more than one sale of a rifle to somebody on the same day.
[01:13:37.338 --> 01:13:38.640]  Congress never passed that law.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.023]  The ATF simply invented that.
[01:13:41.023 --> 01:13:42.104]  The FDA invents things.
[01:13:42.104 --> 01:13:45.829]  Can you give other examples of these oligarchies just inventing their own rules?
[01:13:46.465 --> 01:13:57.913]  Well, there are no procedural checks whatsoever in any of the federal agencies to cause agency officials to second-guess their actions based on restrictions in the Constitution.
[01:13:57.913 --> 01:14:08.882]  So, for example, the government will give itself the authority to engage in these inspections through the ATF, for example, but the ATF agents and the ATF itself
[01:14:09.682 --> 01:14:17.189]  I have no procedural checks to prevent them from infringing upon individuals' rights.
[01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:18.911]  They just don't exist in the government.
[01:14:18.911 --> 01:14:24.676]  And the reason for it, even though they exist in the Constitution, is that the government is a renegade.
[01:14:24.676 --> 01:14:26.778]  It has left the Constitution.
[01:14:26.778 --> 01:14:32.283]  There's a dissonance between what the Constitution requires and what the government is doing that is so great
[01:14:32.904 --> 01:14:45.549]  That we no longer have a nation of free people and a nation that protects our individual liberty, even though at the founding of the Republic, of course, that was the central purpose for having a government at all.
[01:14:45.549 --> 01:14:48.911]  It was to protect the rights of man, the unalienable rights of individuals.
[01:14:49.631 --> 01:15:16.789]  And in the book, Restore the Republic, I not only chronicle this history and precisely how each one of the doctrines the Founding Fathers identified as essential to limiting power and ensuring freedom have been destroyed, but also how we can recreate those doctrines and reimplement them, and specifically what reductions in government, specific agencies and departments that should be eliminated in order for us to save the nation from destruction.
[01:15:16.789 --> 01:15:19.211]  I mean, we are literally within a decade
[01:15:20.172 --> 01:15:24.635]  Wait a minute, let me stop you right there.
[01:15:24.635 --> 01:15:25.516]  Those are strong words.
[01:15:25.516 --> 01:15:30.820]  You also use the term renegade government, but I think people are seeing that, that what you're saying is true.
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:34.723]  You just said we're within a decade of maybe losing the republic we have.
[01:15:34.723 --> 01:15:38.966]  People are seeing that the federal government is increasingly lawless.
[01:15:38.966 --> 01:15:44.571]  It does not even honor the laws of the land, certainly not the Constitution, certainly not the Bill of Rights.
[01:15:45.231 --> 01:15:45.471]  I can't
[01:16:03.735 --> 01:16:13.180]  Having support for a terrorist organization, whether they're rightly accused or wrongly accused, we don't know until there's a trial, but we're certainly entitled to a presumption of innocence.
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:26.187]  That is all blown away because military forces may go and apprehend you and put you in jail and do so indefinitely without ever bringing you before a court of justice, without ever even informing you of their charges.
[01:16:26.187 --> 01:16:29.729]  And that just came into law through the National Defense Authorization Act.
[01:16:29.729 --> 01:16:32.751]  We have reached a state in this country
[01:16:33.717 --> 01:16:39.582]  Where rights are violated with impunity to pursue federal objectives.
[01:16:39.582 --> 01:16:43.965]  I mean the Obamacare for example, the insurance mandate.
[01:16:43.965 --> 01:16:48.989]  We're violating individual's rights to privacy, to freedom of contract,
[01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:55.834]  To freedom of association with impunity with Obamacare.
[01:16:55.834 --> 01:16:58.195]  Everyone must be insured.
[01:16:58.195 --> 01:17:05.700]  You must go out and buy insurance from a private insurer that is qualified by the federal government come January 1, 2014.
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:11.464]  And that's a gross deprivation of your freedom of choice, your individual liberty.
[01:17:11.464 --> 01:17:18.268]  It's antithetical to the very core values of the Constitution and to express rights that are protected by the Constitution.
[01:17:18.428 --> 01:17:20.589]  I do want to get to some solutions.
[01:17:20.589 --> 01:17:33.552]  I know your book offers solutions and I want to ask you about that, but to support what you're saying about the seriousness of this issue, you know, I've got a lot of friends, people, contacts in the military.
[01:17:33.552 --> 01:17:35.273]  There is talk in the military that
[01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:36.573]  Yeah.
[01:17:56.164 --> 01:17:59.927]  You know, behind closed doors, that talk is very real.
[01:17:59.927 --> 01:18:01.488]  It is happening.
[01:18:01.488 --> 01:18:08.173]  Do you think that's an indication of how far down this road of tyranny we have already gone and found ourselves?
[01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:13.614]  Well, there's no more fundamental rule of law than the Constitution.
[01:18:13.614 --> 01:18:26.042]  And when you amend the Constitution without following the process identified in Article 6 of the Constitution, which is to obtain the consent of the American people to an amendment, when you don't do that,
[01:18:27.116 --> 01:18:43.224]  And when you instead just alter the Constitution by making specific provisions, dead letters, by reinterpreting provisions to mean the opposite of what they were intended to mean, when you do those sorts of things, you erode and destroy the legitimacy of the government.
[01:18:44.289 --> 01:18:51.073]  And you invariably invite the very kinds of revolutions that the Founding Fathers feared would be necessary.
[01:18:51.073 --> 01:18:57.216]  I mean, Thomas Jefferson was the most strident advocate of revolution.
[01:18:57.216 --> 01:19:12.125]  He said that if the United States didn't have a revolution every 20 years, he would be fearful for the defense of liberty, because he invariably thought that governors would rule corruptly, that they would pursue their own self-interest at public expense and would deny people their rights.
[01:19:12.885 --> 01:19:19.412]  And Adams and Alexander Hamilton believe that the electoral process would be sufficient.
[01:19:19.412 --> 01:19:21.334]  Well, now we're very much testing that.
[01:19:21.334 --> 01:19:27.040]  I mean, either the government of the United States will come in... Thirty seconds, Jonathan, go ahead.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:35.229]  Either the government of the United States will conform with the Constitution, or it will provoke a reaction from the American people, the likes of which we have not seen.
[01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:40.916]  All right, very important words from Jonathan E. Moore, author of the new book, Restore the Republic.
[01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:45.660]  We'll be back with more interview with Jonathan E. Moore on the other side of this break.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.943]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show, and thank you for tuning in.
[01:19:48.943 --> 01:19:51.686]  A lot of breaking news today, a lot of important information.
[01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:52.366]  Don't go away.
[01:19:52.366 --> 01:19:54.428]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:20:04.434 --> 01:20:09.617]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:20:09.617 --> 01:20:11.478]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:20:11.478 --> 01:20:15.000]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:22.484]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:26.987]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:20:26.987 --> 01:20:32.730]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:34.871]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:20:34.871 --> 01:20:40.974]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:20:40.974 --> 01:20:50.499]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[01:20:50.499 --> 01:20:56.221]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to faketv.com.
[01:20:56.221 --> 01:20:59.163]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[01:21:01.488 --> 01:21:06.413]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[01:21:06.413 --> 01:21:18.787]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.

[01:22:00.587 --> 01:22:04.131]  IRS, the three most dreaded letters of the alphabet.
[01:22:04.131 --> 01:22:14.661]  If you owe back taxes, have unfiled tax returns, are receiving threatening letters, or have IRS agents coming to your home or place of business, you need an experienced IRS agent fighting on your side.
[01:22:14.661 --> 01:22:18.124]  Call the Tax Relief Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[01:22:20.947 --> 01:22:30.715]  Spearheaded by a former IRS agent, we know how to negotiate a reduction in the tax you owe, stop wage garnishments, lift bank levies, and negotiate an affordable repayment plan.
[01:22:30.715 --> 01:22:37.760]  With 17 years as a practicing attorney and an A-plus Better Business rating, we'll get the IRS off your back once and for all.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.064]  In fact, recently, when an IRS employee had a tax problem, she called us.
[01:22:42.344 --> 01:22:45.866]  Stop being afraid and call right now for your free consultation at 800-652-6978.
[01:22:45.866 --> 01:22:47.768]  The phone call is free and there's no obligation, so call 800-652-6978.
[01:22:47.768 --> 01:22:48.128]  Again, that's 800-652-6978.
[01:22:48.128 --> 01:22:49.669]  Actual results based on individual client circumstances.
[01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:04.487]  Claire, it's Anne.
[01:23:04.487 --> 01:23:07.330]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:08.452]  The all-natural one.
[01:23:08.452 --> 01:23:08.912]  Ambrin?
[01:23:08.912 --> 01:23:10.354]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[01:23:10.354 --> 01:23:17.741]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[01:23:17.741 --> 01:23:19.543]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[01:23:19.543 --> 01:23:20.064]  It's gone.
[01:23:20.064 --> 01:23:22.506]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[01:23:22.506 --> 01:23:23.187]  I feel great.
[01:23:23.187 --> 01:23:23.828]  Give me a call.
[01:23:23.988 --> 01:23:27.649]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:31.450]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[01:23:31.450 --> 01:23:35.852]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[01:23:35.852 --> 01:23:38.193]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[01:23:38.193 --> 01:23:41.254]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[01:23:41.254 --> 01:23:45.715]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.

[01:23:52.478 --> 01:23:52.558]  1-800-839-2959.
[01:23:52.558 --> 01:23:54.979]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[01:24:13.817 --> 01:24:18.120]  There's an important article I'd like to bring your attention to on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.961]  We quoted from it earlier about Patty Finn.
[01:24:19.961 --> 01:24:28.527]  This was the attorney who's being basically just completely attacked for defending the rights of parents to avoid vaccinating their children.
[01:24:28.527 --> 01:24:30.168]  The article is written by Kurt Linderman Sr.
[01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:33.340]  Kurt Linderman was a guest before.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:39.402]  He's a very, very outspoken father about vaccine rights for parents.
[01:24:39.402 --> 01:24:45.165]  And the article is entitled, New York Ninth Judicial Committee Attacks Vaccine Parental Rights Attorneys.
[01:24:45.165 --> 01:24:48.406]  So check out that headline on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:48.406 --> 01:24:55.269]  Lots of other news coming up there today from Kurt Nimmo, Paul Joseph Watson, and many of the other outstanding writers.
[01:24:55.269 --> 01:24:56.609]  Also, a programming note.
[01:24:56.609 --> 01:24:58.110]  I apologize to the listeners.
[01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:00.531]  I misquoted the Everything Special price.
[01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:04.873]  It should be $99.95 as it has always been.
[01:25:04.873 --> 01:25:10.415]  That's the Everything Special, $379 plus worth of videos.
[01:25:10.415 --> 01:25:12.936]  Everything that Alex Jones has produced for $99.95.
[01:25:12.936 --> 01:25:15.817]  I misquoted the price earlier and I apologize for that.
[01:25:15.817 --> 01:25:18.398]  There's actually a lot going on today as you might imagine.
[01:25:18.398 --> 01:25:23.921]  Now, we're continuing our interview with Jonathan Emord, author of Restore the Republic, and just before the break,
[01:25:24.381 --> 01:25:31.627]  He was talking about the breakdown of the Republic and how these federal agencies are growing out of control, becoming lawless, renegade agencies.
[01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:34.349]  Where do you want to pick it up, Jonathan, from there?
[01:25:34.349 --> 01:25:53.343]  Well, both Republicans and Democrats who are economists, Alice Rivlin, for example, from the Clinton administration, and Dan Walker, former comptroller general of the United States, agree that federal spending at the present levels is unsustainable, that the government simply cannot exist.
[01:25:54.584 --> 01:25:54.964]  I think?
[01:26:24.584 --> 01:26:29.509]  And the politics of spending are still very much alive.
[01:26:29.509 --> 01:26:43.722]  Government politicians have absolutely no hesitation, such as this president, to offer more and more extraordinarily expensive spending programs, and no serious effort whatsoever to reduce the cost of the government, or the size and the scope of it.
[01:26:44.563 --> 01:26:56.387]  And everything that is private is invariably becoming either public or subject to heavy government regulation and control, stultifying the growth of the marketplace.
[01:26:56.387 --> 01:27:08.952]  So at the same time that the government very much needs more revenue in order to finance this vast expansion of the government that seems endless, it is destroying the very source of its revenue.
[01:27:08.952 --> 01:27:11.473]  But Jonathan, you know here on InfoWars we
[01:27:12.952 --> 01:27:16.100]  All of us here, Alex especially, talks about that that is intentional.
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:18.425]  That's the plan to destroy America.
[01:27:18.425 --> 01:27:20.631]  It's a parasite upon the market.
[01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:22.556]  It's a problem with the current rate of growth.
[01:27:24.792 --> 01:27:26.814]  I'm sorry, we had a little blip in the audio there.
[01:27:26.814 --> 01:27:32.778]  We're saying that... It is to make everything private, public.
[01:27:32.778 --> 01:27:35.280]  Okay, you just said to make everything private, public.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:35.741]  Exactly.
[01:27:35.741 --> 01:27:37.262]  Government controlling the economy.
[01:27:37.262 --> 01:27:39.283]  What about the destruction of the economy?
[01:27:39.283 --> 01:27:40.804]  The destruction of the private sector?
[01:27:40.804 --> 01:27:42.606]  The destruction of innovation?
[01:27:42.606 --> 01:27:46.188]  The moving, the shifting of jobs forcefully outside the country?
[01:27:46.188 --> 01:27:50.832]  Do you think that's deliberate or is it just really poor, poor planning by people in Washington?
[01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:53.686]  No, of course it's deliberate.
[01:27:53.686 --> 01:28:00.112]  These people have spent decades in social engineering and in economic planning.
[01:28:00.112 --> 01:28:08.299]  They have spent lifetimes, these bureaucrats, have spent lifetimes involved in precisely this kind of expansion of the regulatory state.
[01:28:08.299 --> 01:28:15.586]  You know, none of this would have been possible had economic liberty been entitled to full constitutional protection as it was before the 1930s.
[01:28:16.807 --> 01:28:27.490]  It was in the 1930s that the courts reduced the level of protection for economic liberty to a bare minimum, ushering in the regulatory state.
[01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:43.875]  So much so that right off the bat, right out of the starting gates, the National Recovery Act had the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, setting wages, prices, putting controls on production, determining the quantity of units to be produced during the Depression.
[01:28:44.335 --> 01:28:50.142]  And this precedent has been expanded and used over and over again by Republicans and Democrats alike.
[01:28:50.142 --> 01:29:00.436]  So much so that really it is the rare exception that individuals in the marketplace make decisions that are uninfluenced by federal regulation.
[01:29:00.896 --> 01:29:10.384]  Almost every decision a person makes in the marketplace is in one way or another influenced by the direction that the government would have them go in.
[01:29:10.384 --> 01:29:20.012]  So is it any surprise to us then that we're suffering the same kind of economic travise that ultimately brought communist China to capitalism?
[01:29:20.592 --> 01:29:21.293]  No.
[01:29:21.293 --> 01:29:24.996]  But it is shocking that the United States and around the world preaches capitalism.
[01:29:24.996 --> 01:29:25.816]  Stay with us, Jonathan.
[01:29:25.816 --> 01:29:26.517]  Sorry to cut you off there.
[01:29:26.517 --> 01:29:28.198]  We're about to go to break.
[01:29:28.198 --> 01:29:29.920]  The book is called Restore the Republic.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.182]  You can find it at emord.com.
[01:29:32.182 --> 01:29:35.304]  That's E-M-O-R-D dot com.
[01:29:35.304 --> 01:29:37.005]  Or on Amazon, other places.
[01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:37.586]  Stay with us here.
[01:29:37.586 --> 01:29:39.708]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.569]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in.
[01:29:41.569 --> 01:29:45.993]  And we've got Jonathan Emord staying with us for another 30 minutes.
[01:29:45.993 --> 01:29:47.894]  More information about the Republic.
[01:29:47.894 --> 01:29:48.355]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.407 --> 01:29:54.339]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.339 --> 01:29:57.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:06.827]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.827 --> 01:30:15.694]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.694 --> 01:30:20.318]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.318 --> 01:30:31.147]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.767 --> 01:30:41.270]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:46.712]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.712 --> 01:30:54.195]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:54.195 --> 01:30:56.596]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:01.238 --> 01:31:02.319]  I had tried everything.
[01:31:02.319 --> 01:31:04.660]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:07.781]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:31:07.781 --> 01:31:12.623]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[01:31:12.623 --> 01:31:19.487]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:31:19.487 --> 01:31:29.932]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:31:30.692 --> 01:31:35.153]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:31:35.153 --> 01:31:41.415]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:31:41.415 --> 01:31:42.995]  Now that's results.
[01:31:42.995 --> 01:31:49.777]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[01:31:49.777 --> 01:31:55.498]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:31:55.498 --> 01:31:58.058]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:31:58.058 --> 01:31:59.639]  Infowarsteam.com
[01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:01.931]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:07.519]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.519 --> 01:32:12.546]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.546 --> 01:32:17.573]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:18.093 --> 01:32:23.335]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.335 --> 01:32:30.437]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.437 --> 01:32:31.558]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.558 --> 01:32:37.920]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:41.421]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.421 --> 01:32:43.642]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:44.603]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.603 --> 01:32:44.923]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.923 --> 01:32:48.224]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:48.224 --> 01:32:49.965]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:16.227 --> 01:33:22.590]  I was in Houston this weekend, and I hadn't been off my ranch for several months.
[01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:24.391]  I mean, not into a major city.
[01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:25.371]  Well, I guess I was in Dallas.
[01:33:25.371 --> 01:33:26.211]  What am I thinking?
[01:33:26.211 --> 01:33:28.973]  But I mean, I hadn't really, you know, stayed overnight anyplace off the ranch.
[01:33:30.416 --> 01:33:37.721]  I was, I couldn't believe how much trouble Houston is going to be in, in a collapse scenario.
[01:33:37.721 --> 01:33:48.229]  Places like LA, places like New York, Chicago, these cities are in so much trouble and we as a nation are in so much trouble if things start to fall apart.
[01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:50.411]  I mean, there's no place to grow food in these cities.
[01:33:50.411 --> 01:33:51.752]  There's no way to get water.
[01:33:51.752 --> 01:33:52.993]  There's no way to be safe.
[01:33:52.993 --> 01:33:58.177]  There's no, there's probably not going to be any law or order in a breakdown, even like a grid down scenario.
[01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:07.233]  But Jonathan Immort, our guest, continues with us now to talk about what looks like what could be the failing of the Republic if we stay on this current path.
[01:34:07.233 --> 01:34:09.834]  And then how can we stop that from happening?
[01:34:09.834 --> 01:34:14.136]  How can we put us on a new course to restoring the Republic and saving America?
[01:34:14.136 --> 01:34:15.616]  Because America is a great country.
[01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:17.097]  There's so much going for it.
[01:34:17.097 --> 01:34:18.477]  We've got to defend it.
[01:34:18.477 --> 01:34:24.039]  We've got to keep it, get it back on track and stop these tyrants in Washington from stealing our future.
[01:34:24.039 --> 01:34:28.361]  Jonathan, go ahead and continue the point you left off on before the break, or you can start a new point.
[01:34:29.266 --> 01:34:40.594]  Well, um, the irony here is that those who are rapidly spending us into oblivion are going to achieve the very same.
[01:34:40.594 --> 01:34:43.796]  Okay, um, why don't you reconnect with Jonathan Audio only?
[01:34:46.423 --> 01:34:50.407]  Just sorry, we're having some connection issues with Jonathan Eymord there.
[01:34:50.407 --> 01:34:52.448]  Just go ahead and reconnect with him.
[01:34:52.448 --> 01:34:54.630]  But as I was saying, we're in so much trouble, you know.
[01:34:54.630 --> 01:34:59.174]  I know some of the sponsors of the show have survival seed banks and things like that.
[01:34:59.174 --> 01:35:02.117]  Silver Lungs is a product that I really recommend.
[01:35:02.117 --> 01:35:08.763]  People, if you don't get yourself prepared, this year, I mean now, really, it's already almost March.
[01:35:09.944 --> 01:35:10.845]  of 2012.
[01:35:10.845 --> 01:35:14.287]  If you're not getting squared away, you're in deep, deep trouble.
[01:35:14.287 --> 01:35:29.336]  I mean, I've been planting trees and planting vegetables and practicing vermiculture, worm composting on my farm so I can turn food scraps into soil and the soil can feed the plants and the plants can keep us alive.
[01:35:29.336 --> 01:35:32.618]  I've been just almost urgently scrambling to get these skills together.
[01:35:33.587 --> 01:35:35.328]  Because something is coming.
[01:35:35.328 --> 01:35:37.089]  A collapse is coming.
[01:35:37.089 --> 01:35:39.851]  And let me know as soon as we have Jonathan back, guys.
[01:35:39.851 --> 01:35:40.371]  He's good?
[01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:41.011]  He's back with us?
[01:35:41.011 --> 01:35:41.732]  Okay.
[01:35:41.732 --> 01:35:42.172]  Jonathan, go...
[01:35:44.192 --> 01:35:44.953]  No, he's not back yet.
[01:35:44.953 --> 01:35:45.814]  Okay, okay, sorry.
[01:35:45.814 --> 01:35:54.061]  But based on my analysis, the two most likely scenarios that we're facing are, number one, a grid-down scenario, a loss of the power grid.
[01:35:54.061 --> 01:36:01.929]  That could be from, you know, a high-altitude nuclear blast causing an EMP wave, which was discussed by a previous guest here with Alex Jones.
[01:36:01.929 --> 01:36:07.093]  I believe that guest was Matthew Stein, an MIT scientist, if I'm remembering correctly.
[01:36:07.093 --> 01:36:08.154]  A second possibility
[01:36:09.269 --> 01:36:12.951]  Is a bioweapon release that could be intentional or unintentional.
[01:36:12.951 --> 01:36:19.854]  And I'm sort of going with the intentional side from the government, you know, the depopulation global elite who really do want to kill people.
[01:36:19.854 --> 01:36:21.355]  They're evil.
[01:36:21.355 --> 01:36:24.436]  They hate life and they want to kill us off.
[01:36:24.436 --> 01:36:28.218]  And a bioweapon is a very, sadly, it's a very effective way to do that.
[01:36:28.678 --> 01:36:37.402]  So if you're not prepared for those two scenarios, grid down and bioweapon release, then I don't think you're prepared for the future that we may be facing.
[01:36:37.402 --> 01:36:49.347]  And so I really want to urge you, you know, from me to you, all the listeners of InfoWars who are really informed, who are really patriotic, who are just some of the best people, the most amazing people in the country, you are the future of our society.
[01:36:49.347 --> 01:36:52.268]  You're the future of the human race because you're not eating the GMOs.
[01:36:53.251 --> 01:36:55.793]  You're not destroying your fertility with vaccines.
[01:36:55.793 --> 01:36:57.875]  You're not killing yourself with all the chemicals.
[01:36:57.875 --> 01:37:00.898]  And you're, you know, you're eating the organics when you can.
[01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:03.160]  You're taking the superfoods when you can.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.143]  You are the future of the human race.
[01:37:06.143 --> 01:37:12.449]  So I want to urge you to get prepared, stay alive, stay safe, so that you can stay part of the solution as we restore this republic.
[01:37:12.449 --> 01:37:15.732]  Now, Jonathan is back with us, joining us again.
[01:37:15.732 --> 01:37:16.312]  Jonathan, go ahead.
[01:37:16.312 --> 01:37:16.673]  Can you hear me?
[01:37:17.335 --> 01:37:31.557]  Yes, you know the irony of all this is that the government is going to be reduced in its size and scope and cost by force or by volitionally through dangers.
[01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:40.591]  Through changes that are brought about as a result of willingness to accept the reforms that are necessary.
[01:37:40.591 --> 01:37:49.013]  So either the government will do this volitionally or it will happen inevitably because the government simply can't sustain itself at present levels.
[01:37:49.013 --> 01:37:49.733]  Indefinitely.
[01:37:49.733 --> 01:37:51.214]  Cannot happen.
[01:37:51.214 --> 01:37:56.475]  And in fact it's likely to cause a reduction, a dissolution of the government within a decade.
[01:37:57.324 --> 01:38:06.749]  What does that look like if the government doesn't rein itself in and it blows through the realistic boundaries of spending?
[01:38:06.749 --> 01:38:08.310]  I mean, what happens, really?
[01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:15.293]  In your opinion, I see we're having connection.
[01:38:15.293 --> 01:38:17.695]  Okay, guys, just reconnect to him audio only.
[01:38:17.695 --> 01:38:22.617]  I think that'll work best.
[01:38:22.617 --> 01:38:24.138]  Okay, I'm hearing little bits and pieces of him.
[01:38:25.017 --> 01:38:33.839]  Okay, I want to ask Jonathan, when we reconnect with him, what that looks like, and then I want to get to solutions, because his book is about solutions as well as not just what's wrong.
[01:38:33.839 --> 01:38:47.222]  You know, that's the thing that you get here from Alex Jones Show and InfoWars is, yeah, we're going to be honest and upfront about the problems that face our society, about the loss of freedom, about the overzealous, tyrannical tendencies of the federal government.
[01:38:47.942 --> 01:38:54.688]  And it's mad departments like DHS, DEA, USDA, you name it.
[01:38:54.688 --> 01:38:55.669]  But we want to get to solutions.
[01:38:56.758 --> 01:38:59.419]  So what can we do as activists, as citizens?
[01:38:59.419 --> 01:39:02.060]  And so much of what you're doing out there is working.
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:06.361]  You're succeeding in getting fluoride out of the water in many cities across the country.
[01:39:06.361 --> 01:39:17.265]  You are succeeding in many ways of defending the Bill of Rights, of defending the Second Amendment in some areas, of at least raising the issue of defending the Fourth Amendment in many areas.
[01:39:17.265 --> 01:39:18.926]  Hey, even Wyoming, we covered that earlier.
[01:39:18.926 --> 01:39:24.088]  Wyoming is talking about having a plan to survive a national collapse.
[01:39:24.568 --> 01:39:31.251]  You know, they're talking about having their own strike aircraft and their own draft and their own military, if it comes to that.
[01:39:31.251 --> 01:39:34.092]  Their own currency, if it comes to that.
[01:39:34.092 --> 01:39:40.815]  So there are people out there who are looking at solutions and saying, how do we keep all of this alive so that we can move forward?
[01:39:40.815 --> 01:39:41.735]  Jonathan's back with us.
[01:39:41.735 --> 01:39:43.136]  Go ahead, Jonathan, where you left off.
[01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:53.115]  Well, this is going to, the destruction of the Republic will happen if the political people will not take the steps necessary to downsize the government dramatically.
[01:39:53.115 --> 01:39:57.939]  I mean, we need to do what Ron Paul is calling for, a trillion dollars in spending cuts now.
[01:39:57.939 --> 01:40:05.023]  We can't afford $200 billion to $400 billion a year when we're spending $1.3 trillion in excessive receipts.
[01:40:05.023 --> 01:40:06.624]  It's just not sustainable.
[01:40:06.624 --> 01:40:13.229]  We have $62 trillion in entitlement commitments presently and that figure is going to rise as the
[01:40:13.609 --> 01:40:21.652]  The boomer population gets bigger and bigger and federal spending commitments that are added on through Obamacare add more to the national debt.
[01:40:21.652 --> 01:40:25.133]  So, we're in a situation that is absolutely unsustainable.
[01:40:25.133 --> 01:40:29.215]  The government will collapse of its own accord unless dramatic reductions take place.
[01:40:29.215 --> 01:40:30.375]  Alright, well what will happen?
[01:40:30.375 --> 01:40:32.396]  What is the sequence of events?
[01:40:32.396 --> 01:40:38.678]  Well, we're going to see something obvious, which is further degradation in the American credit rating.
[01:40:41.329 --> 01:40:41.589]  I think?
[01:41:02.065 --> 01:41:02.145]  to
[01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:29.490]  Inflationary effects are going to eliminate the economic benefit of any of the benefits the government provides and also destroy the economy at the same time.
[01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:39.292]  There's no way that you can maintain this level of spending and inflation of the money supply and not have it reverberate into the market and cause extreme inflation.
[01:41:39.292 --> 01:41:41.333]  So we're going to end up with hyperinflation
[01:41:41.813 --> 01:41:53.469]  We're going to end up with a diminution in the availability of federal benefits because of the fact that those who provide them simply cannot economically afford to provide them.
[01:41:54.470 --> 01:42:08.602]  Is that, Jonathan, why you think there has been a ramp up in activity at FEMA camps, why there's more talk of taking away the rights to protest, requiring a permit to protest?
[01:42:08.602 --> 01:42:15.007]  Is there an anticipation of a coming federal collapse that's causing the government right now to clamp down on rights ahead of time?
[01:42:16.152 --> 01:42:32.615]  Well, there is some of that, but there's also a view by politicians which is very grossly irresponsible, and that is that as long as they can maintain the spending spree for a time, at least past the time that they retire from office, they can leave it to somebody else to solve it.
[01:42:32.615 --> 01:42:35.736]  That's basically the Obama approach to this.
[01:42:35.736 --> 01:42:45.878]  He's not going to take the debt seriously because he anticipates that the rubber is going to hit the road and really destroy the United States after he leaves office from a second term.
[01:42:46.618 --> 01:42:56.460]  And it's not a situation where any member of Congress, Republican or Democrat, with very few exceptions, is willing to do what is necessary to save the country.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:13.924]  As a consequence, we have to commence and maintain a national movement that calls into question the actions that are taken that are unconstitutional, demands that the government be brought back in line with the constitutional requirements, and votes into office those who favor those positions, and demands from them
[01:43:14.484 --> 01:43:14.744]  I think?
[01:43:35.649 --> 01:43:40.015]  that will break down the government and will privatize entitlements.
[01:43:40.015 --> 01:43:44.221]  We need to go through a system of second bests I identify in the book where
[01:43:45.492 --> 01:43:47.754]  We start with this environment of second best.
[01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:53.537]  We would have been better had we not gotten involved with Social Security and health, Medicare and Medicaid to begin with.
[01:43:53.537 --> 01:43:57.480]  But having gotten there, how do we wean the American public from it?
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:03.404]  And what I offer is a system of modifications of the corporate and individual income tax to achieve that.
[01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:08.187]  Part of my plan would eliminate the individual income tax, phasing it out of existence.
[01:44:08.187 --> 01:44:15.372]  But during a transition period, I use tax breaks for corporations to enable them to pick up
[01:44:15.632 --> 01:44:16.572]  We're good to go.
[01:44:36.619 --> 01:44:43.045]  She says that people who receive unemployment checks go out and spend it and help stimulate the economy.
[01:44:43.045 --> 01:44:52.354]  So I guess in her mind, and in many of those in Washington, the way to have abundance in America is to make sure that everybody's jobless and spending unemployment checks.
[01:44:53.288 --> 01:44:59.209]  Well, they advocate a nation of dependency and they also create this deception for the poor.
[01:44:59.209 --> 01:45:17.534]  It's a kiss of death to the poor from the Obama administration that if they rely on these government programs, which incidentally will only take a fraction of them and provide them with anything of economic value, the rest are just given this blank promise which can never be fulfilled, but the notion that we will tax the country
[01:45:18.254 --> 01:45:18.635]  I think?
[01:45:33.223 --> 01:45:37.587]  The President would like to take those reserves of wealth and bring them to the government
[01:45:53.602 --> 01:45:54.643]  I don't
[01:46:09.757 --> 01:46:10.257]  I think?
[01:46:26.994 --> 01:46:32.056]  The programs, and furthermore, they're out of sync with the market.
[01:46:32.056 --> 01:46:51.923]  What we want is to liberate the market so that employment levels can increase and so that we can become a nation that is competitive with the rest of the world and that provides a growth in the economic pie instead of having a static pie that we continuously carve apart and remove into the government sector.
[01:46:53.223 --> 01:46:58.469]  Jonathan, you're coming at this from the point of view of being a rational person who wants to help the nation and help the people.
[01:46:58.469 --> 01:47:11.704]  And those in charge today who have the political clout and the power, who make the economic decisions, the evidence is increasingly just readily apparent that they want to destroy this nation.
[01:47:11.704 --> 01:47:14.026]  I mean, so how, getting to the solutions section.
[01:47:14.967 --> 01:47:29.027]  How do the citizens, how do the activists, how do the free people of America take part in a real, you know, a peaceful revolution of taking back their power and restoring sanity, economic sanity among other things, to America?
[01:47:30.043 --> 01:47:46.518]  Well, there has to be a focal point, and many of the campaigns have provided an opportunity for people to see things that may prove this, the alternative vision of freedom and the Constitution, a reality again, such as the Ron Paul campaign.
[01:47:46.518 --> 01:47:51.062]  But the point, what I'm doing, is starting a national movement
[01:47:51.562 --> 01:47:52.783]  to restore the Republic.
[01:47:52.783 --> 01:48:18.686]  We have an e-newsletter that's coming out in April that will be a focal point identifying specific instances of government abuse in the bureaucracy, the executive branch, Congress that violate the Constitution, specific means by which to protest those actions, and then also we're going to demand that elected representatives agree to a platform that will result in a restoration of the Republic and a restoration of the Constitution.
[01:48:18.766 --> 01:48:20.807]  Where can people sign up for that e-newsletter?
[01:48:20.807 --> 01:48:22.428]  At emord.com?
[01:48:22.428 --> 01:48:24.750]  Yeah, it'll be through emord.com.
[01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:28.373]  It'll also be restoretherepublic.co.
[01:48:28.373 --> 01:48:32.755]  And it's under construction right now, but April 1, it'll be available.
[01:48:32.755 --> 01:48:45.064]  And we're going to try to create this national movement and push very strongly for the specific purpose of restoring the republic, restoring the constitutional principles and limits on government power.
[01:48:45.544 --> 01:48:53.667]  And removing from office those members of Congress and the Senate who are derelict in their responsibilities of upholding their oath of office in the Constitution.
[01:48:53.667 --> 01:48:55.308]  So, we're moving in that direction.
[01:48:55.308 --> 01:49:13.595]  I think that as the crisis continues, as circumstances worsen with the debt, as circumstances worsen and make it apparent to virtually every American that they're not going to get Social Security, they're not going to have, as Reid has promised, Social Security as we know it.
[01:49:13.595 --> 01:49:14.636]  It's just not going to exist.
[01:49:15.196 --> 01:49:15.836]  We're good to go.
[01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:35.528]  Uh, those who are incapable of caring for themselves.
[01:49:35.528 --> 01:49:51.383]  And that can be done if the government will give a $1.50 tax deduction for every $1 that a company expends to assist in providing medical care, to assist in providing retirement benefits and so forth for those who are indigent.
[01:49:51.383 --> 01:49:53.045]  And there's no reason why this can't happen.
[01:49:53.405 --> 01:49:56.568]  It's so easy, actually, in America to solve the healthcare problem.
[01:49:56.568 --> 01:50:03.974]  All we have to do is stop poisoning everybody, get the fluoride out of the water, get the GMOs out of the food, get the toxic pesticides out of the food, get the additives.
[01:50:03.974 --> 01:50:07.136]  I mean, we're being poisoned, and if you take that away, healthcare costs drop.
[01:50:07.136 --> 01:50:08.978]  I know that's a separate issue from what you mentioned.
[01:50:08.978 --> 01:50:16.023]  We've only got about a minute left before the break, Jonathan, but can you talk about Ron Paul writing the intro for your book very quickly?
[01:50:16.023 --> 01:50:17.905]  How did you get Ron Paul to do that?
[01:50:17.905 --> 01:50:18.806]  He's a busy guy these days.
[01:50:19.468 --> 01:50:23.111]  Well, I work rather regularly with their office.
[01:50:23.111 --> 01:50:26.875]  I've drafted several pieces of legislation for his office.
[01:50:26.875 --> 01:50:36.504]  And in the course of discussing my plans to write this book, I was surprised, pleasantly, when they offered to write the foreword.
[01:50:37.233 --> 01:50:40.834]  All right, well, will you stay with us one more segment there, Jonathan?
[01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:43.375]  We've got more questions for you.
[01:50:43.375 --> 01:50:47.636]  And for those listening, this is an interview with Jonathan Emord here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:47.636 --> 01:50:49.256]  Thank you for staying with us.

[01:53:57.658 --> 01:53:59.406]  That's 123survivalplan.com
[01:54:20.014 --> 01:54:29.940]  We're back with Jonathan Emore, author of Restore the Republic, a very important new book that lays out a pathway to actually protecting the future of freedom in America.
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:35.023]  Jonathan Emore joins us by phone to continue that discussion.
[01:54:35.023 --> 01:54:40.206]  Jonathan, we were talking about solutions and what people can do right now, what activists can do right now.
[01:54:40.206 --> 01:54:41.427]  That's what people are hungry for.
[01:54:41.427 --> 01:54:42.827]  They want to be part of a solution.
[01:54:42.827 --> 01:54:46.550]  They don't want to see this country just fail and collapse into total destruction.
[01:54:47.530 --> 01:54:49.131]  Continue along those lines, please.
[01:54:49.131 --> 01:54:51.731]  What can people do right now to be part of the solution?
[01:54:51.731 --> 01:55:14.357]  Well, we're creating this e-newsletter as a focal point to identify each of the specific instances where the administration, the bureaucracy, Congress, the executive branch deviates from the requirements of the Constitution, violates the Constitution, and also on this fiscal irresponsibility, identifying specific measures that threaten to destroy the country and to advocate reform.
[01:55:15.337 --> 01:55:37.656]  And to do so both with the support of identifying politicians to support who are in favor of the principles that we articulate, which are in favor of the Constitution, and to attack those who are not, and also to demand that specific changes be made to alter the course of this government into a constitutional direction.
[01:55:37.656 --> 01:55:39.037]  So it's an ongoing thing.
[01:55:39.037 --> 01:55:41.099]  It's a monthly e-newsletter.
[01:55:41.099 --> 01:55:44.041]  We're looking to create a movement to restore the Republic.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:55.343]  We're using that rubric, Restore the Republic, to identify all those people in this country who are advocates of the Constitution, asking them to come on board and help us in this movement to do this.
[01:55:55.343 --> 01:56:04.485]  We're hoping to get large numbers of people behind the movement and to become a critical voice in the evolution of this country.
[01:56:04.485 --> 01:56:11.107]  The book, Restore the Republic, is an ambitious undertaking on my part, but I have identified the means to
[01:56:11.767 --> 01:56:11.927]  I think?
[01:56:41.987 --> 01:56:43.668]  All right, that makes perfect sense.
[01:56:43.668 --> 01:56:46.649]  And right now I'm going to pledge to you some software technology.
[01:56:46.649 --> 01:56:54.972]  You know, I founded a software company almost 20 years ago that can handle sending out very large volumes of emails to opt-in subscribers.
[01:56:54.972 --> 01:57:00.274]  So I'd like to donate that to your organization and help support your message to bring you subscribers.
[01:57:00.274 --> 01:57:05.035]  You'll need good technology to send out email to millions of people, which I'm sure this will grow to.
[01:57:05.035 --> 01:57:07.156]  Let me also give you the Rick Perry quiz.
[01:57:07.156 --> 01:57:09.757]  Can you name three government agencies to eliminate?
[01:57:11.314 --> 01:57:12.354]  Very easy.
[01:57:12.354 --> 01:57:14.735]  Take the Federal Communications Commission.
[01:57:14.735 --> 01:57:15.755]  It can be privatized.
[01:57:15.755 --> 01:57:17.975]  There's no reason why the government should own the airwaves.
[01:57:17.975 --> 01:57:20.896]  It can be a complete private system.
[01:57:20.896 --> 01:57:35.999]  We can take the Federal Food and Drug Administration and we can eliminate its drug approval process and its medical device approval process by making that a university-based system and having a blinded system of review take place at the universities, which is presumptively a determination of safety and efficacy.
[01:57:35.999 --> 01:57:38.240]  We can eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:39.740]  There's absolutely no reason why
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:49.773]  Local health and safety can't protect us from environmental pollutants and going after companies that are responsible for trespass or otherwise disturbing the environment.
[01:57:49.773 --> 01:57:53.017]  We can eliminate the Department of Commerce.
[01:57:53.017 --> 01:57:55.400]  There's no reason why we should have a Department of Commerce, really.
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.901]  Why should the federal government be involved in that?
[01:57:57.901 --> 01:58:05.324]  We can eliminate the Department of Education, and very well should, because the Department of Education is a federal system that's destroying education in this country.
[01:58:05.324 --> 01:58:08.386]  What we need are more private incentives in education.
[01:58:08.386 --> 01:58:09.446]  Those are just a few.
[01:58:09.446 --> 01:58:13.028]  The big government people like to say, well, how can you be against education?
[01:58:13.028 --> 01:58:14.309]  How can you be against the environment?
[01:58:14.309 --> 01:58:14.969]  You're not.
[01:58:14.969 --> 01:58:17.770]  Actually, the Department of Education is anti-education.
[01:58:17.770 --> 01:58:19.471]  The EPA is anti-environment.
[01:58:19.471 --> 01:58:21.032]  The FDA is anti-health.
[01:58:21.032 --> 01:58:22.112]  I mean, that's the issue.
[01:58:22.112 --> 01:58:23.953]  And the Department of Energy is anti-energy.
[01:58:24.393 --> 01:58:31.278]  We need to get rid of the Department of Energy as well, but there are many listed in the book precisely how it can be done and the cost savings that come from eliminating it.
[01:58:31.278 --> 01:58:32.499]  All right, stay with us if you would.
[01:58:32.499 --> 01:58:33.900]  We'll go into a quick break.
[01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:37.483]  We'll be right back with more with Jonathan Emord, author of Restore the Republic.
[01:58:37.483 --> 01:58:38.663]  Please stay with us, Jonathan.
[01:58:38.663 --> 01:58:41.766]  Straight ahead.

[01:59:44.903 --> 01:59:46.163]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.163 --> 01:59:47.443]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.919 --> 02:00:10.761]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.761 --> 02:00:12.341]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.341 --> 02:00:13.902]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.902 --> 02:00:18.083]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.083 --> 02:00:22.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.203 --> 02:00:25.945]  We are live from Austin, Texas, but this isn't Alex today.
[02:00:25.945 --> 02:00:29.088]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex, who is on the road.
[02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:34.573]  We're continuing our interview with Jonathan Eymord, author of Restore the Republic.
[02:00:34.573 --> 02:00:43.420]  And, in fact, I've got a quote from Gandhi here that I wanted to bring in because it reminds me of the kind of ethics and courage that Jonathan Eymord brings to every issue.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:51.227]  Gandhi says, quote, many people, especially ignorant people, want to punish you for speaking the truth, for being correct, for being you.
[02:00:51.927 --> 02:00:56.592]  Never apologize for being correct or for being years ahead of your time.
[02:00:56.592 --> 02:00:59.334]  If you're right and you know it, speak your mind.
[02:00:59.334 --> 02:01:02.698]  Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is still the truth.
[02:01:02.698 --> 02:01:06.301]  That's of course a quote from Gandhi.
[02:01:06.301 --> 02:01:11.466]  Jonathan, thanks for staying with us for this additional five minutes.
[02:01:11.466 --> 02:01:14.629]  What else can you tell us about what we need to do right now to restore the Republic?
[02:01:15.404 --> 02:01:20.568]  Well, the good news is that liberty is the inevitable condition of mankind.
[02:01:20.568 --> 02:01:31.395]  Despite the fact that governments are owned now, and governments historically have endeavored to take away individual liberty and to deprive people of freedom of choice, that has invariably failed.
[02:01:31.395 --> 02:01:43.383]  And the sad lesson that this government is going to learn is that you may not enslave the entire American population without the consequence that a country dependent upon their earnings
[02:01:44.324 --> 02:02:09.371]  uh... to survive a parasitic government that depends upon that uh... those earnings to uh... operate its machinery will collapse of its own weight if it deprives people of the freedom necessary to make a living and that's where we're at we're at this point where there's a good percentage of the american population upset with the government demanding constitutional reform back to the original constitution precisely because
[02:02:10.051 --> 02:02:19.761]  The government has so arrogantly exceeded its authority that it now threatens the existence of a market upon which we all depend to live.
[02:02:19.761 --> 02:02:22.664]  And I think we're going to get there.
[02:02:22.664 --> 02:02:29.871]  I just hope that we get there through the reforms that we're talking about, through this Restore the Republic movement, rather than
[02:02:30.952 --> 02:02:42.782]  Uh, getting there as a result of the collapse of the government and the calamity that it will cause to the economy and the disruption and injury that it will cause to so many people as a result of that derelict course.
[02:02:42.782 --> 02:02:44.403]  Let me ask you about the Commerce Clause.
[02:02:44.403 --> 02:02:49.067]  I'm sure this is one of the key points of your platform, the Restore the Republic platform.
[02:02:49.067 --> 02:02:58.355]  Are you going to go after the Commerce Clause and the overreaching misinterpretation of that clause by the federal government which it uses, as you well know, to go after things like raw milk freedom?
[02:02:59.173 --> 02:02:59.633]  Right.
[02:02:59.633 --> 02:03:08.781]  The Commerce Clause was never intended to give government a free check in order to go into every single private domain and regulate it.
[02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:11.263]  But that's how the Congress of the United States is interpreted.
[02:03:11.263 --> 02:03:13.185]  Obamacare is a perfect example.
[02:03:13.185 --> 02:03:21.432]  The Commerce Clause was intended to prevent states from imposing barriers to free enterprise that would destroy the value of contract and
[02:03:21.832 --> 02:03:23.694]  and disable the free enterprise system.
[02:03:23.694 --> 02:03:25.136]  That's why the Commerce Clause was created.
[02:03:25.136 --> 02:03:37.892]  It was created specifically to deal with the crisis that then existed in which some of the nation states were imposing tariff barriers to prevent outside industry from getting into the states.
[02:03:38.533 --> 02:03:51.620]  It was never intended to give the federal government a power to take over all the operation of the states and to transform the individual into a servant of the federal government doing the government's bidding on public policy.
[02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:54.102]  This Obamacare is an unprecedented
[02:03:54.582 --> 02:03:55.383]  We're good to go.
[02:04:11.024 --> 02:04:14.587]  They could come along and order you to buy vaccines, whether you need them or not.
[02:04:14.587 --> 02:04:19.952]  They could order you to buy, you mentioned electric cars, they could order you to buy pesticides or GMOs.
[02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:21.734]  I mean, they could just demand it of everyone.
[02:04:21.734 --> 02:04:27.139]  We're talking about a command economy, top-down, communist-style, centralized economy.
[02:04:27.139 --> 02:04:29.381]  That's what Obamacare really represents.
[02:04:29.381 --> 02:04:29.641]  Right.
[02:04:29.641 --> 02:04:33.304]  The essence of the Obama administration is that it's distrust.
[02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:40.020]  It's distrust of the American people, and we have to restore individual sovereignty in order for this nation to be great again.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:41.000]  All right.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.381]  Thank you, Jonathan, for joining us today.
[02:04:42.381 --> 02:04:45.221]  I really appreciate your time and your effort, your courage as an American.
[02:04:45.221 --> 02:04:46.282]  Thank you very much.
[02:04:46.282 --> 02:04:47.222]  Thank you so much, Mike.
[02:04:47.222 --> 02:04:47.842]  All right.
[02:04:47.842 --> 02:04:48.502]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:04:48.502 --> 02:04:55.383]  We'll be right back after this break with Liz Rietzig and some information on raw milk freedom, plus some other breaking news straight ahead.
[02:04:55.383 --> 02:04:56.484]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:56.484 --> 02:04:56.964]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.964 --> 02:04:57.544]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:08.388]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.388 --> 02:05:13.530]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.530 --> 02:05:22.252]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:22.252 --> 02:05:26.312]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:26.312 --> 02:05:28.533]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:40.416 --> 02:05:42.557]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.557 --> 02:05:44.338]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:44.338 --> 02:05:47.219]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:47.219 --> 02:05:51.460]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.841]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.841 --> 02:05:56.542]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:56.542 --> 02:05:58.123]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:58.123 --> 02:05:58.923]  Got it.
[02:05:58.923 --> 02:05:59.424]  Others don't.
[02:06:01.047 --> 02:06:08.270]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:26.156]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:06:26.156 --> 02:06:30.278]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:06:30.538 --> 02:06:32.319]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:06:32.319 --> 02:06:40.485]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:06:40.485 --> 02:06:46.789]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:06:46.789 --> 02:06:48.070]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:06:48.070 --> 02:06:48.950]  It's incredible.
[02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:58.156]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:06:58.156 --> 02:06:59.998]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:07:00.798 --> 02:07:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:06.281]  Number one.
[02:07:06.281 --> 02:07:09.703]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.703 --> 02:07:10.543]  Number two.
[02:07:10.543 --> 02:07:15.445]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.445 --> 02:07:16.186]  It's true.
[02:07:16.186 --> 02:07:21.068]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.068 --> 02:07:21.888]  Number three.
[02:07:21.888 --> 02:07:25.470]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:29.172]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.372 --> 02:07:30.173]  Number 4.
[02:07:30.173 --> 02:07:32.936]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.936 --> 02:07:36.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:37.400]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:41.565]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.565 --> 02:07:46.330]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.590 --> 02:07:50.774]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.774 --> 02:07:52.556]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.556 --> 02:07:54.798]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.798 --> 02:07:57.640]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:07.970]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:30.709]  That was a fascinating segment with attorney Jonathan Emord, author of Restore the Republic, and I really want to encourage all InfoWars listeners to check out his website, emord.com, that's E-M-O-R-D, and to sign up for his email newsletter, which I'm going to talk to him after the show and see if we can help support that newsletter in some other ways.
[02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:31.810]  I think Jonathan Emord
[02:08:32.961 --> 02:08:38.383]  That is truly one of the most important patriots and voices for the future of our republic.
[02:08:38.383 --> 02:08:47.067]  And no wonder that Ron Paul was willing to write the intro for his book, and no wonder Jonathan Imhord's reputation is so strong around the country.
[02:08:47.067 --> 02:08:51.308]  And so we'll cover him on Natural News, and I'm sure Alex will want to talk to him here on InfoWars as well.
[02:08:51.308 --> 02:08:57.591]  Look, we are in so much trouble if we don't take serious action now.
[02:08:58.551 --> 02:09:08.582]  And ban together those of us who understand history, who understand liberty, who understand the fundamentals of the distribution of power, who understand basic Austrian economics, for example.
[02:09:08.582 --> 02:09:11.605]  Lou Rockwell has been a frequent guest here on the show.
[02:09:11.605 --> 02:09:12.526]  If those of us who
[02:09:14.195 --> 02:09:14.255]  Who
[02:09:34.761 --> 02:09:38.703]  You know, I don't want to paint a doomsday picture, but that has happened in history.
[02:09:38.703 --> 02:09:43.225]  And it happened using the exact same processes that we are going through right now.
[02:09:43.225 --> 02:09:47.907]  The disarmament, and then the grabbing of federal power, and then the enslavement of the people.
[02:09:49.013 --> 02:09:51.194]  Holocaust is the natural step that happens right after that.
[02:09:51.194 --> 02:09:52.494]  So, we want to prevent that.
[02:09:52.494 --> 02:09:53.194]  We want peace.
[02:09:53.194 --> 02:09:53.835]  We want health.
[02:09:53.835 --> 02:09:54.515]  We want abundance.
[02:09:54.515 --> 02:09:55.935]  We want entrepreneurship.
[02:09:55.935 --> 02:09:57.356]  We want a strong, healthy economy.
[02:09:57.356 --> 02:09:59.517]  And that's why we've got a band together on this.
[02:09:59.517 --> 02:10:03.698]  Now, we're going to be joined here in this segment by Liz Reitzig.
[02:10:03.698 --> 02:10:11.901]  She is, of course, one of the most prominent voices in the raw milk and food freedom industries, or worlds, realms.
[02:10:13.308 --> 02:10:17.750]  She's got a very important announcement for us today that I want to get behind and help spread the word on.
[02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:19.111]  There's a rally happening this Friday.
[02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:21.472]  She will give you the details on that.
[02:10:21.472 --> 02:10:24.053]  Let's bring her on right now for that news.
[02:10:24.053 --> 02:10:25.773]  Liz, are you with us?
[02:10:25.773 --> 02:10:26.134]  Hi, Mike.
[02:10:26.134 --> 02:10:26.694]  Here I am.
[02:10:26.694 --> 02:10:28.174]  Hi there, Liz.
[02:10:28.174 --> 02:10:31.556]  Great to have you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:31.556 --> 02:10:33.617]  Tell us about this rally.
[02:10:33.617 --> 02:10:35.738]  Well, thanks so much for having me on.
[02:10:35.738 --> 02:10:38.099]  Yeah, just a little bit about the rally on Friday.
[02:10:38.099 --> 02:10:40.800]  It's in support of farmer Vernon Hershberger.
[02:10:42.014 --> 02:10:46.098]  And he is a Wisconsin dairy farmer who has been targeted by the state.
[02:10:46.098 --> 02:10:50.482]  It's the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.
[02:10:50.482 --> 02:10:54.826]  And they've gone after him for not having certain licenses.
[02:10:54.826 --> 02:11:00.211]  And all he's doing is providing good, wholesome, clean foods to his community.
[02:11:00.211 --> 02:11:05.937]  And so he has a hearing coming up this Friday in Sauk County at the Baraboo Courthouse.
[02:11:06.769 --> 02:11:08.009]  All right, let me spell some of those words.
[02:11:08.009 --> 02:11:15.691]  Sauk County is S-A-U-K, Sauk County, and Baraboo, Wisconsin is B-A-R-A-B-O-O, kind of like it sounds.
[02:11:15.691 --> 02:11:16.792]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:11:16.792 --> 02:11:27.394]  And so we're just, a lot of supporters are just getting behind him and rallying with him and standing with him as he takes a very strong stand for our food freedoms.
[02:11:27.394 --> 02:11:29.575]  All right, so we need InfoWarriors out there.
[02:11:29.575 --> 02:11:33.676]  What are the closest cities to Baraboo, Wisconsin within driving distance where they could attend?
[02:11:34.423 --> 02:11:35.925]  Madison is very close.
[02:11:35.925 --> 02:11:38.789]  Well, relatively speaking, it's about an hour and a half away.
[02:11:38.789 --> 02:11:41.072]  And Chicago is about two hours away.
[02:11:41.072 --> 02:11:43.755]  But people are flying in from all over the country for this.
[02:11:43.755 --> 02:11:52.567]  And we're going to have some really strong announcements, including we're unveiling and reading and signing a declaration of food independence at the rally.
[02:11:52.992 --> 02:11:54.853]  Okay, wow, I heard some buzz about that.
[02:11:54.853 --> 02:11:57.375]  The Declaration of Food Independence.
[02:11:57.375 --> 02:12:01.258]  Obviously lots of historical echoes and ramifications there.
[02:12:01.258 --> 02:12:04.160]  Do you have any details on that or is that going to be unveiled on the day?
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:08.182]  It's going to be unveiled on the day and we will be live streaming it.
[02:12:08.182 --> 02:12:09.964]  So if anybody wants to tune in, they can.
[02:12:10.592 --> 02:12:12.534]  Well, I can imagine what it's going to say.
[02:12:12.534 --> 02:12:27.652]  I mean, you know, we have a natural God-given right to grow our own food, to milk a cow, to share food with neighbors or barter food with neighbors, and the government has no right to tell us what we can and cannot eat, especially when it's natural food right off our own farms and ranches, right?
[02:12:28.342 --> 02:12:29.383]  Right, that's correct.
[02:12:29.383 --> 02:12:36.766]  And, you know, we go a little further and we say we even have a right to engage in mutually consenting arrangements for our food.
[02:12:36.766 --> 02:12:39.428]  Oh my gosh, trade you mean?
[02:12:39.428 --> 02:12:41.989]  How dare you think that slaves can trade?
[02:12:41.989 --> 02:12:43.930]  Right, exactly.
[02:12:43.930 --> 02:12:49.413]  So it would be if you're a producer, I'm a consumer, we have that right as long as we're both agreeable.
[02:12:50.117 --> 02:12:58.100]  Liz, give us some background on Vernon Hershberger, who is being targeted for this oppression.
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.061]  What's the background on Vernon?
[02:13:00.061 --> 02:13:08.244]  Well, basically, he has a private buying group, so he's got some members of his community that his farm supplies food for.
[02:13:08.244 --> 02:13:14.707]  Now, they're all kind of co-owners in the farm, so it's a private buying club, and he distributes from his farm.
[02:13:15.942 --> 02:13:28.942]  And this about a year ago, the state came in and because he did not have a retail food establishment license, they came onto his farm and they taped all his coolers shut.
[02:13:28.942 --> 02:13:29.643]  And Vernon, he
[02:13:31.536 --> 02:13:34.978]  Cut that tape and he said, I'm open.
[02:13:34.978 --> 02:13:36.139]  Come and get your food.
[02:13:36.139 --> 02:13:36.880]  Right.
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:39.581]  That's cutting through the red tape, literally.
[02:13:39.581 --> 02:13:40.262]  Exactly.
[02:13:40.262 --> 02:13:47.707]  So he's now he's got ongoing court proceedings to deal with that issue and some other just licensure issues.
[02:13:47.707 --> 02:13:53.591]  So he's got the he's that he's operating a real retail food establishment without a license.
[02:13:53.591 --> 02:14:00.055]  He's got that charge against him and operating a dairy plant without a license and operating a milk
[02:14:02.056 --> 02:14:04.437]  Establishment, something like that, without a license.
[02:14:04.437 --> 02:14:07.798]  But again Liz, consumers were in no way misled.
[02:14:07.798 --> 02:14:10.298]  They knew they were buying raw, fresh dairy.
[02:14:10.298 --> 02:14:14.399]  They know there are always inherent risks in something that is raw.
[02:14:14.399 --> 02:14:18.880]  There are actually more risks for processed, dead, homogenized milk, but that's a whole different story.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:21.381]  I mean, it's not like consumers were being misled in any way, correct?
[02:14:22.048 --> 02:14:23.449]  Oh, that's absolutely correct.
[02:14:23.449 --> 02:14:23.629]  Right.
[02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:25.069]  And it goes even further than that.
[02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:30.051]  All of these consumers are active participants in the production of their food.
[02:14:30.051 --> 02:14:31.111]  Right.
[02:14:31.111 --> 02:14:33.012]  Yeah.
[02:14:33.012 --> 02:14:34.733]  Here comes the DATCP.
[02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:38.334]  That's the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.
[02:14:38.334 --> 02:14:40.755]  And they're telling people they can't have their own food.
[02:14:41.314 --> 02:14:44.078]  So there's a news story posted today.
[02:14:44.078 --> 02:14:45.860]  I think this is on InfoWars as well.
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:50.786]  Harvard study, pasteurized milk from industrial dairies has been linked to cancer.
[02:14:50.786 --> 02:14:58.656]  Scientific evidence shows that, again, conventional pasteurized milk contains up to 33 times more estrone sulfate.
[02:14:59.597 --> 02:15:01.618]  Which causes cancer.
[02:15:01.618 --> 02:15:05.020]  How come they don't talk about the dangers of pasteurized milk?
[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:10.742]  They always talk about the dangers of raw or fresh milk, as if that's like al-Qaeda milk or something.
[02:15:10.742 --> 02:15:13.243]  It's terrorism to drink fresh milk.
[02:15:13.243 --> 02:15:17.965]  Right, and you know the fresh milk, it just every once in a while spontaneously explodes.
[02:15:17.965 --> 02:15:18.886]  Yeah, right, little milk bombs.
[02:15:18.886 --> 02:15:20.246]  You really have to be careful of it.
[02:15:21.809 --> 02:15:30.531]  But seriously though, you know, there's more and more information coming out just about pasteurized milk and what's in it and why it is a problem.
[02:15:30.531 --> 02:15:40.172]  And, you know, the CDC information lists pasteurized milk and it lists the illnesses and outbreaks that occur with it.
[02:15:40.172 --> 02:15:43.393]  And that it's one of the most allergenic foods in America.
[02:15:43.393 --> 02:15:48.714]  Okay, Liz, let's get some websites out to people who want to participate in this event.
[02:15:48.714 --> 02:15:49.694]  Where do they go to get information?
[02:15:50.538 --> 02:15:53.500]  They can go to rawmilkfreedomriders.com.
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:56.382]  Okay, rawmilkfreedomriders.com.
[02:15:56.382 --> 02:15:57.423]  See if you can bring that up, guys.
[02:15:57.423 --> 02:16:00.345]  Is there any other website?
[02:16:00.345 --> 02:16:04.808]  The Farm Food Freedom Coalition, which is farmfoodfreedom.org.
[02:16:04.808 --> 02:16:06.509]  That's the sponsoring organization.
[02:16:06.509 --> 02:16:07.250]  All right.
[02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:11.933]  And then, of course, the Weston A. Price Foundation, which is westonaprice.org.
[02:16:11.933 --> 02:16:12.214]  Great.
[02:16:12.214 --> 02:16:16.677]  And that's a really good resource for nutritional information, including benefits of real milk.
[02:16:17.659 --> 02:16:40.062]  Now, this has been going on for quite a long time in America now, where the government is bringing guns to these food operations, like we saw with the Rossum food raids, and the government is destroying the food, and the government is intimidating farmers, and destroying picnics, and making them destroy their food, and they've gone after Vernon Hershberger here, and they've arrested the Amish farmers.
[02:16:41.384 --> 02:16:46.588]  How long do you think this is going to continue to go on before the American people say enough is enough?
[02:16:46.588 --> 02:16:48.249]  You know, we're not putting up with this anymore.
[02:16:48.249 --> 02:16:51.452]  We're going to fight back or sue the government or something.
[02:16:52.557 --> 02:16:54.758]  Well, I sincerely hope it's not much longer.
[02:16:54.758 --> 02:17:00.242]  My farmer that I relied on for a lot of my food, he just got shut down by the FDA.
[02:17:00.242 --> 02:17:11.909]  And it's devastating, it's horribly upsetting, and I hope that with the consequences like that, people begin to stand up and say, enough is enough, and we must do something.
[02:17:11.909 --> 02:17:17.273]  And it's not going to be just farmers, because there just are not enough farmers left in this country.
[02:17:17.813 --> 02:17:25.195]  For just their voices to be loud enough, so it has to be consumers, even consumers who aren't dedicated to choosing farm-fresh foods.
[02:17:25.195 --> 02:17:35.358]  Maybe they just want to eat cereal and soda all day long, but they still want to eat what they want to eat, not what a small sub-segment of the population tells them they can eat.
[02:17:35.438 --> 02:17:36.840]  Well, there's even more to it than that.
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:41.085]  Do you realize this, listeners, that they're trying to literally kill you.
[02:17:41.085 --> 02:17:48.936]  They don't want you to eat farm fresh food, so they're going to outlaw all of that and call you a criminal and call you a terrorist if you engage in trading fresh milk.
[02:17:48.936 --> 02:17:50.858]  But what you're supposed to eat is the GMO.
[02:17:51.519 --> 02:17:53.542]  You're supposed to eat the pesticides.
[02:17:53.542 --> 02:18:02.232]  You're supposed to eat the foods that are laced with chemicals that will destroy your gut and cause immunological disorders and cause obesity and cause cancer.
[02:18:02.232 --> 02:18:04.235]  I mean, it's an agenda.
[02:18:04.235 --> 02:18:08.821]  I'm telling you, Liz, it's an agenda to outlaw real food and kill the American consumers.
[02:18:09.557 --> 02:18:09.878]  It is.
[02:18:09.878 --> 02:18:11.500]  It's upside down and backwards.
[02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:20.151]  And I have, you know, I have small, five small children and I can feed them fast food three times a day or soda and lollipops all day long.
[02:18:20.151 --> 02:18:24.377]  But as soon as I go to Pennsylvania and get a gallon of milk and bring it home for them, I'm a criminal.
[02:18:24.557 --> 02:18:30.180]  Oh yeah, if you want to feed your kids aspartame and MSG and high fructose corn syrup, no problem, the government approves of all that.
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:33.402]  Yeah, because the lobbies are in there telling them it's all okay, no problem.
[02:18:33.402 --> 02:18:41.807]  But if you want actual living food, fresh milk, raw juice, you know, sprouts, all these things, they say it's terrible, so dangerous, so dangerous.
[02:18:41.807 --> 02:18:52.453]  The CDC has put out a bunch of propaganda about raw milk being dangerous, and we fought back against that with an article that said pasteurized milk is 150 times more filthy than raw milk.
[02:18:52.453 --> 02:18:54.174]  Saw that, that was really great, yeah.
[02:18:54.639 --> 02:18:57.701]  Yeah, what else do people need to know about this issue?
[02:18:57.701 --> 02:19:08.707]  Well, that there just needs to be a consumer uprising and consumer support of these farmers and that, you know, we've got to stand with the farmers who are willing to stand up and keep going despite whatever threats they get.
[02:19:10.253 --> 02:19:12.274]  And that's Vernon right now, and he's doing it.
[02:19:12.274 --> 02:19:14.115]  So we've got to stand with him.
[02:19:14.115 --> 02:19:16.156]  You know, anybody, anywhere can do this.
[02:19:16.156 --> 02:19:17.897]  They can come to the courthouse.
[02:19:17.897 --> 02:19:20.239]  They can participate in some way.
[02:19:20.239 --> 02:19:31.605]  We've also got a rights workshop that we're hosting the day before so that people can just really be aware of their fundamental rights and realize how many other people are with them on this.
[02:19:31.605 --> 02:19:32.806]  You know, we're not isolated.
[02:19:33.126 --> 02:19:35.487]  Liz, I want you to stay with us for quite a while longer.
[02:19:35.487 --> 02:19:41.750]  I've got a lot of questions for you and maybe we can get some callers on board to ask you some questions if you're open to that.
[02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:48.873]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show and an interview with Liz Reitzig, who is a raw milk and food freedom advocate.
[02:19:48.873 --> 02:19:52.234]  An event coming up this Friday in Baraboo, Wisconsin.
[02:19:52.234 --> 02:19:54.515]  A lot more details straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:54.515 --> 02:19:55.035]  Stay with us.
[02:19:55.035 --> 02:19:56.296]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:20:02.068 --> 02:20:08.110]  If you're having any problems with the IRS or a local revenue agency, I understand and I can help.
[02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:10.011]  I'm tax attorney Tony Dennison.
[02:20:10.011 --> 02:20:15.073]  When I was a kid, the IRS came after my mother's house because of mistaken information.
[02:20:15.073 --> 02:20:20.295]  Ever since then, I've dedicated my life to defending people in trouble with the IRS.
[02:20:20.295 --> 02:20:28.898]  I'm a real tax attorney, which means I have two law degrees, a standard law degree known as a JD, and a tax law degree known as a Masters of the Laws in Taxation.

[02:24:07.631 --> 02:24:13.253]  New research has come out of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
[02:24:13.253 --> 02:24:15.694]  It was led by virologist Peter Pelese.
[02:24:17.410 --> 02:24:26.116]  And it reveals that the World Health Organization has been greatly exaggerating the fatality rate of bird flu.
[02:24:26.116 --> 02:24:27.977]  Now, what does that have to do with the segment here?
[02:24:27.977 --> 02:24:36.763]  We're talking with Liz Reitzig about raw milk and, you know, government tries to say that raw milk or fresh milk is so dangerous and deadly for you.
[02:24:36.763 --> 02:24:38.965]  Well, these government institutions say that all the time.
[02:24:38.965 --> 02:24:46.350]  They use fear-mongering to scare you into compliance on their medical agenda or their food agenda or their just total enslavement agenda.
[02:24:46.350 --> 02:24:46.850]  It turns out
[02:24:48.027 --> 02:24:56.751]  That the WHO, World Health Organization, says about 50-59% of the people who get infected by bird flu die.
[02:24:56.751 --> 02:24:59.993]  Turns out it's only 1%, according to this new study.
[02:24:59.993 --> 02:25:03.915]  Just 1%!
[02:25:03.915 --> 02:25:11.318]  Yeah, well, I mean, how else can they scare people into a stage 6 pandemic if they don't spread a bunch of fear stories?
[02:25:11.318 --> 02:25:14.740]  And of course, they're spreading fear stories about milk.
[02:25:14.740 --> 02:25:16.361]  So Liz, are you still with us there?
[02:25:17.014 --> 02:25:18.015]  Yes, hi Mike.
[02:25:18.015 --> 02:25:19.276]  Alright, good to have you on.
[02:25:19.276 --> 02:25:21.979]  What do you make of all this fear-mongering about milk?
[02:25:21.979 --> 02:25:27.724]  What could possibly be in the minds of these government agents who are trying to scare us to death about drinking milk?
[02:25:29.144 --> 02:25:32.585]  Well, you know, it's an old paradigm.
[02:25:32.585 --> 02:25:35.225]  And there's a lot of new research coming out.
[02:25:35.225 --> 02:25:39.366]  Like a lot of the research they're looking at is 50 to 100 years old.
[02:25:39.366 --> 02:25:44.127]  And that's when the raw milk was coming from distillery dairies.
[02:25:44.127 --> 02:25:49.628]  So there was a problem at the turn of the century when there was no closed milking systems.
[02:25:49.628 --> 02:25:57.369]  There was distillery dairies, which means the dairies were actually in the distilleries or right next to the distilleries and the cows were fed the slop from them.
[02:25:58.149 --> 02:26:05.093]  And then there was no refrigeration or cold trucking or closed milking systems.
[02:26:05.093 --> 02:26:07.575]  And there was not good sanitation in the cities.
[02:26:07.575 --> 02:26:14.619]  So there was a problem with the production methods and with the actual product, you know, 150 years ago.
[02:26:14.619 --> 02:26:14.979]  Right.
[02:26:14.979 --> 02:26:20.943]  Well, just like there was a problem with raw sewage flowing down the streets and people getting cholera and dysentery from unsanitary conditions.
[02:26:20.943 --> 02:26:22.183]  But that's that's over now.
[02:26:22.183 --> 02:26:26.406]  I mean, you know, people flush their toilets and it goes into, you know.
[02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:32.331]  And so it is true that there is the occasional illness associated with raw milk.
[02:26:32.331 --> 02:26:34.851]  And, you know, that's like any food ever.
[02:26:34.851 --> 02:26:37.352]  And the only way to prevent that is just to stop eating.
[02:26:37.352 --> 02:26:39.473]  And then you have other things to worry about.
[02:26:39.473 --> 02:26:46.995]  But this idea that somehow raw milk is inherently dangerous or that it's so much more dangerous than anything else, that is just fear mongering.
[02:26:47.608 --> 02:26:48.629]  Yeah, yeah, of course it is.
[02:26:48.629 --> 02:26:50.490]  But it's fear-bongering that's very manipulative.
[02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:54.213]  It has a specific agenda to scare people into compliance.
[02:26:54.213 --> 02:26:58.196]  You know, fear, classic Hegelian dialectic, right?
[02:26:58.196 --> 02:26:59.357]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:26:59.357 --> 02:27:02.460]  Problem being raw milk, they say is dangerous.
[02:27:02.460 --> 02:27:04.461]  Reaction, people say clamp down on raw milk.
[02:27:04.461 --> 02:27:08.665]  Solution is the processed milk industry gets all the money and has a monopoly.
[02:27:08.665 --> 02:27:10.546]  That's the whole system.
[02:27:10.546 --> 02:27:11.046]  Right.
[02:27:11.046 --> 02:27:14.089]  Or the legalization and tight control of raw milk.
[02:27:15.179 --> 02:27:16.520]  Yeah, I guess the regulation of it.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:27.945]  If we have the tight control and the regulators are telling producers how to produce it and they have to dot every I and cross every T, then if they don't, then they're criminals for that.
[02:27:27.945 --> 02:27:34.188]  You know, I think most people don't realize if they visit a raw milk dairy, it is the cleanest dairy operation you will ever visit.
[02:27:34.628 --> 02:27:40.189]  Versus a typical corporate-run, conventional, pasteurized, homogenized milk dairy operation.
[02:27:40.189 --> 02:27:41.189]  It's filthy!
[02:27:41.189 --> 02:27:45.170]  It's blood, it's pus, it's feces going into the milk.
[02:27:45.170 --> 02:27:51.692]  In fact, there are allowed levels of all these things in pasteurized milk, which the government says is safe because they pasteurize it.
[02:27:51.692 --> 02:27:54.812]  So, you're drinking pus and blood and feces.
[02:27:54.812 --> 02:27:58.613]  They're a lot less careful about that milk because they know it's going through that kill step.
[02:27:59.383 --> 02:28:01.783]  Yeah, well, just what we wanted for lunch, huh?
[02:28:01.783 --> 02:28:05.144]  Dead feces, and that's okay for school lunch programs?
[02:28:05.144 --> 02:28:06.304]  Right, exactly.
[02:28:06.304 --> 02:28:06.644]  Crazy.
[02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:08.985]  We've only got a couple minutes in this segment.
[02:28:08.985 --> 02:28:14.686]  Now, can you give us any more clue about who else is going to be at this event on Friday in Baraboo, Wisconsin?
[02:28:14.686 --> 02:28:18.267]  And we want to encourage all Info Warriors who can attend, please attend.
[02:28:18.267 --> 02:28:19.067]  What time of the day?
[02:28:19.067 --> 02:28:21.047]  That's at 11 a.m.?
[02:28:21.047 --> 02:28:22.147]  It starts at 11 a.m.
[02:28:22.147 --> 02:28:23.228]  Central Time, yes.
[02:28:23.228 --> 02:28:24.788]  Okay, and who else is going to be there?
[02:28:25.413 --> 02:28:26.473]  Well, Vernon, of course.
[02:28:26.473 --> 02:28:39.359]  It is a hearing for him and a lot of his buying club owners, so the co-owners of his farm, and food activists and food freedom activists from around the country.
[02:28:39.359 --> 02:28:40.059]  Okay, good.
[02:28:40.059 --> 02:28:43.181]  Do we still have a camera person there?
[02:28:43.181 --> 02:28:47.763]  We haven't had a chance to talk since then, but I pledged a dollar amount to hire a camera person so we could get footage.
[02:28:47.763 --> 02:28:48.443]  Is that still in play?
[02:28:48.925 --> 02:28:50.526]  That is still in play, yes.
[02:28:50.526 --> 02:28:51.286]  Okay, great.
[02:28:51.286 --> 02:28:53.448]  We're doing everything we can to support this.
[02:28:53.448 --> 02:28:55.088]  So as soon as you get the footage, let us know.
[02:28:55.088 --> 02:29:01.052]  We'll get that posted, we'll share it with InfoWars, and maybe they can get it posted on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube as well.
[02:29:01.052 --> 02:29:05.154]  Okay, it might become a very interesting event.
[02:29:05.154 --> 02:29:06.535]  Okay, well that's what we want.
[02:29:06.535 --> 02:29:12.878]  I mean, and rest assured that whatever happens there is going to be on the record, on camera, the world is going to see it.
[02:29:12.878 --> 02:29:16.180]  It'll probably have millions of views over the next year of people watching that event.
[02:29:17.099 --> 02:29:23.413]  Well, I certainly hope so because it's time for people really to start getting behind the farmers or we're going to not have that food availability.
[02:29:24.295 --> 02:29:25.536]  Well, that's the thing that people don't realize.
[02:29:25.536 --> 02:29:29.399]  If they can come after your raw milk today, they can come after your backyard garden tomorrow.
[02:29:29.399 --> 02:29:33.342]  They can outlaw you sprouting seeds in your own kitchen counter.
[02:29:33.342 --> 02:29:35.564]  I mean, they can outlaw anything.
[02:29:35.564 --> 02:29:36.604]  Raw milk.
[02:29:36.604 --> 02:29:37.345]  Yeah.
[02:29:37.345 --> 02:29:38.126]  Stay with us, Liz.
[02:29:38.126 --> 02:29:40.688]  There's a lot more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:40.688 --> 02:29:45.792]  We'll be right back after this break with continuing our interview with Liz Reitzig about food freedom.

[02:33:36.613 --> 02:33:40.134]  We'll be taking calls in the next segment.
[02:33:40.134 --> 02:33:42.135]  Now Liz, I've got a question for you.
[02:33:42.135 --> 02:33:49.257]  Some part of me thinks that maybe this whole oppression of raw milk and the fact that the government keeps bringing guns
[02:33:50.157 --> 02:33:51.939]  Well, it's an interesting theory.
[02:33:51.939 --> 02:33:56.742]  No, I'm a little more optimistic than that, and I think it's just their own aggression.
[02:33:56.742 --> 02:34:01.926]  I don't think they're really trying to get the dairy farmers to be aggressive.
[02:34:18.046 --> 02:34:21.668]  It's just the government being aggressive in their... Yeah.
[02:34:21.668 --> 02:34:27.853]  And when you pit the aggressive government against a very peaceful thought, just the contrast is astounding.
[02:34:27.853 --> 02:34:30.855]  And it just highlights how aggressive the government is being.
[02:34:32.005 --> 02:34:35.027]  Well, and also, isn't it a violation of everything this country was founded on?
[02:34:35.027 --> 02:34:46.736]  I mean, we wouldn't have the United States of America if it wasn't for farmers growing, for example, industrial hemp back in the day, producing raw milk and fresh milk, bartering food with their neighbors.
[02:34:46.736 --> 02:34:49.198]  I mean, that's what this country was founded on.
[02:34:49.198 --> 02:34:56.663]  That's right, and that's what, I mean, historically, it's like that's what builds communities, and that's what strengthens them.
[02:34:56.663 --> 02:34:58.445]  Yeah, yeah, well said, absolutely.
[02:34:59.695 --> 02:35:02.376]  I do want to go to callers here.
[02:35:02.376 --> 02:35:03.377]  Yeah, we've got plenty of time.
[02:35:03.377 --> 02:35:05.518]  Okay, let's go to Nathan in Oklahoma.
[02:35:05.518 --> 02:35:08.879]  You're on the air with Liz Reitzig on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:08.879 --> 02:35:09.659]  Go ahead, Nathan.
[02:35:09.659 --> 02:35:12.380]  Hi.
[02:35:12.380 --> 02:35:18.923]  I'm actually doing my best to run as an independent candidate for the presidential election this year.
[02:35:18.923 --> 02:35:28.347]  With this thawed milk issue, we also need to go back to the basics that the soil depletion and all that in order for the food that we feed the
[02:35:29.164 --> 02:35:39.271]  You know, the cows, in order for that to be nutritious, in order for them to have healthy immune systems, healthy structures.
[02:35:39.271 --> 02:35:40.332]  Couldn't agree with you more, Nathan.
[02:35:40.332 --> 02:35:43.514]  Are you a farmer or do you have experience as a farmer?
[02:35:43.514 --> 02:35:45.055]  Yes, a lot of my relatives are.
[02:35:45.055 --> 02:35:49.178]  Do you have a question for Liz?
[02:35:49.178 --> 02:35:50.940]  How would you propose to
[02:35:54.551 --> 02:36:01.134]  Get on a larger scale, healthier milk and you know, real milk to Americans.
[02:36:01.134 --> 02:36:07.456]  Well, it's just going to happen one farmer at a time and you know what they're going to need to do is and a lot of them have begun.
[02:36:07.456 --> 02:36:14.699]  They're going to need to transition from the conventional dairies back out to pasture and I know like I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:36:14.699 --> 02:36:23.223]  You know the soil is very depleted and it took thousands of years for the soil to develop to the point where it was as rich as it was when
[02:36:24.352 --> 02:36:26.313]  You know, for example, when the buffalo were roaming.
[02:36:26.313 --> 02:36:32.255]  And to get it back, farmers are really going to have to be good stewards of the land and cultivate the land.
[02:36:32.255 --> 02:36:34.316]  And consumers are going to have to help with that.
[02:36:34.316 --> 02:36:35.937]  Like, there's just no getting around it.
[02:36:35.937 --> 02:36:39.638]  Like, we cannot just sit back and let the farmers do all the work anymore.
[02:36:39.638 --> 02:36:42.599]  You know, we've got to be active participants in our own food supply.
[02:36:42.599 --> 02:36:46.041]  Yeah, know where your food comes from and buy local whenever you can.
[02:36:46.041 --> 02:36:47.341]  Thanks for your question, Nathan.
[02:36:47.341 --> 02:36:47.982]  Good question.
[02:36:47.982 --> 02:36:50.663]  Joe from Arkansas, you're on the air with Liz Reitzig.
[02:36:50.663 --> 02:36:51.163]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:36:52.526 --> 02:36:53.146]  Yeah, okay.
[02:36:53.146 --> 02:36:54.767]  My question for Liz is this.
[02:36:54.767 --> 02:37:01.832]  I suspect that one of the main reasons for the decline of America in the late 20th and 21st century is milk pasteurization, and here's why.
[02:37:01.832 --> 02:37:03.072]  This is my suspicion.
[02:37:03.072 --> 02:37:08.115]  Because, as I understand it, the brain has a lot of fat, and the brain needs healthy fats growing up and developing.
[02:37:08.115 --> 02:37:08.576]  That's right.
[02:37:08.576 --> 02:37:15.600]  And that the main fat that kids used to get growing up, the main healthy fat that they would get, would be from raw milk.
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:21.063]  And when milk started to be pasteurized, the kids wouldn't get that healthy fat that helps the brain develop normally anymore.
[02:37:21.570 --> 02:37:35.790]  So they wouldn't be as intelligent and have as good of a moral nature as kids growing up used to and that would be one of the main declines for the America and the main reason for the decline of America in the late 20th and 20th first century and my question is
[02:37:36.348 --> 02:37:40.552]  Do you know of any scientific evidence that would show that I might possibly be right there?
[02:37:40.552 --> 02:37:42.975]  Well, let me clarify that before Liz takes it.
[02:37:42.975 --> 02:37:50.683]  Pasteurized milk still does contain fat, but it is homogenized, which means the fat molecules are modified to become more artificial in the structure.
[02:37:50.683 --> 02:37:53.265]  So that is a very interesting theory that you've asserted there.
[02:37:53.265 --> 02:37:54.507]  What do you think, Liz?
[02:37:54.507 --> 02:37:55.488]  Could there be any truth to that?
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:01.603]  Well, certainly good nutrition is an important component of any culture.
[02:38:01.603 --> 02:38:10.207]  And certainly we've had some slips in that where we have not been providing as good of nutrition as we can to our younger generations.
[02:38:10.207 --> 02:38:18.210]  Now, whether or not that's primarily responsible for the decline of anything, I'm not sure.
[02:38:18.210 --> 02:38:21.572]  And I definitely am not aware of any studies that affirm that.
[02:38:22.022 --> 02:38:24.903]  Well, I think there's so many factors involved there.
[02:38:24.903 --> 02:38:26.923]  You know, milk could certainly be one of them.
[02:38:26.923 --> 02:38:28.144]  Did you have a follow-up comment there, sir?
[02:38:28.144 --> 02:38:29.924]  No, that was it.
[02:38:29.924 --> 02:38:30.705]  Okay, thank you.
[02:38:30.705 --> 02:38:31.625]  Thank you for your call.
[02:38:31.625 --> 02:38:32.805]  Let's go to John in Michigan.
[02:38:32.805 --> 02:38:34.466]  Do you have a question for Liz?
[02:38:34.466 --> 02:38:35.806]  Go ahead, John.
[02:38:35.806 --> 02:38:37.347]  Yes, good afternoon.
[02:38:37.347 --> 02:38:41.128]  Do you know Greg Neuendorf?
[02:38:41.128 --> 02:38:42.388]  Yes.
[02:38:42.388 --> 02:38:43.948]  Hello?
[02:38:43.948 --> 02:38:44.589]  No, I don't.
[02:38:44.589 --> 02:38:44.869]  I don't.
[02:38:44.869 --> 02:38:45.089]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:45.089 --> 02:38:46.849]  I thought you were speaking to Liz.
[02:38:46.849 --> 02:38:48.510]  Liz, do you know Greg?
[02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:48.710]  Yes.
[02:38:49.674 --> 02:38:51.035]  Okay, good.
[02:38:51.035 --> 02:38:52.636]  He's a friend.
[02:38:52.636 --> 02:39:02.703]  But there's a doctor here in Michigan, Northern Michigan, and he has an article in regards to A1 and A2 cows.
[02:39:02.703 --> 02:39:04.525]  Are you familiar with A1 and A2 cows?
[02:39:04.525 --> 02:39:05.145]  Yes.
[02:39:05.145 --> 02:39:06.326]  Yes, definitely.
[02:39:06.326 --> 02:39:16.793]  Okay, I don't know if your audience is, but the A2 cows are the ones that are supposed to be the ones that we drink the milk from, and the A1 are the ones that are supposed to be the ones we eat.
[02:39:16.793 --> 02:39:19.095]  And I think it has to do with the amount of casein that's in the
[02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:20.271]  We're good.
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:45.483]  I have to admit I'm not very well versed in that.
[02:39:45.483 --> 02:39:58.067]  I know there is a difference and that the A2 protein is preferable, but I do not, I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of that, but I do recommend that anybody who has any type of digestive issues with dairy
[02:39:58.467 --> 02:39:59.408]  Let me speak to that also.
[02:39:59.408 --> 02:40:07.412]  The overriding issue is that the pasteurization of milk from either variety of cow destroys the lactase enzyme that allows your body to more easily digest the lactose.
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:40.174]  Many of the side effects and problems that processed dairy tends to cause in people, constipation, sinus problems, even a buildup of arterial plaque, atherosclerosis, for example, may be attributed to the inability to digest the milk due to the destruction of the lactase enzyme due to heat processing.
[02:40:40.174 --> 02:40:43.316]  So, sorry to get too technical for everybody out there, but good question.
[02:40:43.316 --> 02:40:46.179]  Marshall in Oklahoma, you're on the air, go ahead with your question please, sir.
[02:40:46.179 --> 02:40:48.320]  Hey, how are you all?
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:48.941]  Hey, doing great, man.
[02:40:50.131 --> 02:40:50.951]  Good deal.
[02:40:50.951 --> 02:41:07.860]  I just wanted to make a statement that, you know, there's farmers out there, as long as they know that we want the milk and we seek them out, then, you know, they're probably more than likely to provide us what we'll be asking them for as long as we, you know, we find them and ask them.
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:18.865]  And I guess my question would be, is there any tips that y'all would have for, you know, finding a local farmer that would be able to provide you with fresh milk and other fresh produce and things?
[02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:20.418]  You want to take that, Liz?
[02:41:20.418 --> 02:41:20.641]  Go ahead.
[02:41:21.249 --> 02:41:36.132]  Sure, there's a wonderful website called RealMilk.com and it's a project of the Weston A. Price Foundation and they list by location, by state, all the raw milk providers within that area or at least all the ones who are willing to be listed.
[02:41:36.132 --> 02:41:49.375]  And if you don't see anybody near you or if you're in a state that prohibits the sale of raw milk, you can also look up on the Weston A. Price Foundation website for the local chapter leaders and contact them directly because often
[02:41:49.975 --> 02:41:52.016]  They will have additional information.
[02:41:52.016 --> 02:41:53.136]  You know, I want to speak to that, too.
[02:41:53.136 --> 02:42:07.800]  Part of the issue here is that as the federal government and even state governments in California, for example, when they go after more raw milk farmers, it sends a message that if you try to do this, you're going to be arrested at gunpoint and you're going to find yourself in court.
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:12.862]  So it suppresses that entire activity by farmers, and that is by design, of course.
[02:42:12.862 --> 02:42:13.722]  Any comments on that, Liz?
[02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:36.965]  Well, yeah, if you do go that route, and especially if you need to call a chapter leader about it, you want to just make sure you let them know as much about you as possible, because right now what happens is FDA, you know, I don't know if Jonathan spoke about this on your last segment, but the FDA has actually been putting undercover spy people into buying clubs.
[02:42:36.965 --> 02:42:38.366]  Infiltrators, yeah, spies.
[02:42:38.366 --> 02:42:39.247]  Infiltrators, right.
[02:42:40.868 --> 02:42:48.831]  You know, people who, farmers, they want to know their customers and they want to know that they're not an undercover spy coming to try to shut them down.
[02:42:48.831 --> 02:43:00.815]  So people, and especially the people who connect consumers to the farmers, they need to know as well so that they feel safe saying, okay, yeah, this person you can sell milk to or you can have them in your buying club.
[02:43:01.121 --> 02:43:11.853]  You know, I'm just astounded by, just listening to this myself, sitting here in the command center of Infowars, how little the mainstream public knows about any of this.
[02:43:11.853 --> 02:43:13.915]  The hoax media refuses to cover it.
[02:43:13.915 --> 02:43:16.278]  People aren't taught the difference between pasteurized milk
[02:43:16.718 --> 02:43:19.099]  Thank you sir, and I just wanted to say it's
[02:43:44.446 --> 02:43:50.609]  I truly believe that absolute freedom for farmers is the key to life on our garden planet.
[02:43:50.609 --> 02:43:55.532]  And of course, your wonderful movement with the milk is real clear.
[02:43:55.532 --> 02:43:59.054]  Who can deny the righteousness of where you're going?
[02:43:59.054 --> 02:44:11.241]  And what I'm trying to say is that I see it as a concept that potentially is helping to solve the entire planet of death, cult, and all the rest of it.
[02:44:12.239 --> 02:44:25.888]  Reorient ourselves back to a more living, celebrating life by allowing family farms to exist and encouraging them and organic farming and less Monsantino or Monsanto.
[02:44:25.888 --> 02:44:27.349]  This is Ronnie Reeferseed, right?
[02:44:31.753 --> 02:44:32.613]  You got it, yes sir!
[02:44:32.613 --> 02:44:33.033]  Thank you!
[02:44:33.033 --> 02:44:34.434]  Yeah, I've heard you on the show many times.
[02:44:34.434 --> 02:44:35.374]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:44:35.374 --> 02:44:41.555]  So, do you see these strong parallels then between raw milk freedom and let's say industrial hemp freedom, just farming freedom?
[02:44:41.555 --> 02:44:44.596]  I mean, what other examples do you see out there of those?
[02:44:44.596 --> 02:44:53.878]  Boy, that is such a great point because there's really no limit to the... We can build houses with hemp products.
[02:44:53.878 --> 02:44:57.599]  I mean, hemp is an incredibly strong fiber and not to mention the
[02:44:58.422 --> 02:45:11.433]  There's literally thousands of years of research that have been going on to the medicinal or the flowering part of it, but either the flowering or just the male hemp plant is incredibly beneficial and has been used for, like I said, eons.
[02:45:11.433 --> 02:45:13.374]  Absolutely, it's real medicine.
[02:45:13.374 --> 02:45:15.095]  Living milk is a type of medicine, too.
[02:45:15.095 --> 02:45:18.198]  In fact, do you have a question, Ronnie, for Liz?
[02:45:18.198 --> 02:45:19.659]  She's our guest right now.
[02:45:19.659 --> 02:45:21.861]  Do you have a question for her?
[02:45:21.861 --> 02:45:28.066]  Well, specifically, I was asking her opinion if she also saw the correlation between the
[02:45:28.633 --> 02:45:29.975]  Absolute freedom for farmers.
[02:45:29.975 --> 02:45:32.198]  I mean, I was just trying to expand that.
[02:45:32.198 --> 02:45:44.775]  She's obviously one huge part of that, and I was just trying to make the point that it's not only, you know, for, well, it promotes peace, and it ends war, and it ends killing people with, you know, all these
[02:45:45.661 --> 02:45:49.065]  Uh, evil chemicals and pesticides.
[02:45:49.065 --> 02:45:50.466]  That's right.
[02:45:50.466 --> 02:45:52.629]  All these things are not unrelated.
[02:45:52.629 --> 02:45:54.190]  You're exactly right, Ronnie.
[02:45:54.190 --> 02:45:56.192]  And by the way, good to meet you on the air here.
[02:45:56.192 --> 02:46:01.438]  Liz, can you speak to that, why food freedom is essential for peace and abundance on our planet?
[02:46:02.703 --> 02:46:05.684]  Well, wow, that's certainly an avalanche there.
[02:46:05.684 --> 02:46:20.068]  But yeah, it is because, you know, when we have that freedom to engage directly with the producer or farmer of our choice, I mean, that opens up worlds that don't exist right now and that can exist.
[02:46:20.068 --> 02:46:29.211]  And I really see this whole issue of food freedom and raw milk kind of being the catalyst for it as this is like a gateway into the rest of the freedoms.
[02:46:29.731 --> 02:46:40.231]  Because once you realize you can, in fact, safely engage directly with farmers, that just opens up a whole new realm, a whole new paradigm of freedom.
[02:46:41.209 --> 02:46:47.990]  I think also the flip side to that is that the GMO food and the processed food and the dead food is really the food of enslavement.
[02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:52.411]  That's the food of war, the food of conflict, the food of being dumbed down.
[02:46:52.411 --> 02:46:57.952]  And so, you know, you can choose which, what kind of society you want to build based on what kind of food you eat.
[02:46:57.952 --> 02:46:59.793]  Would you agree with that, Liz?
[02:46:59.793 --> 02:47:00.453]  Absolutely.
[02:47:00.453 --> 02:47:10.015]  And, you know, I mean, it's very telling because the products that are used to grow GMO crops are the leftover products from war.
[02:47:11.935 --> 02:47:13.577]  What do you mean?
[02:47:13.577 --> 02:47:25.149]  Well, the pesticides and the herbicides that they spray on the GMO crops are derived from chemical agents used in World War II.
[02:47:26.226 --> 02:47:26.646]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:47:26.646 --> 02:47:29.528]  Well, chemotherapy is as well, derived from the same thing.
[02:47:29.528 --> 02:47:34.931]  IG Farben, the chemotherapy agents are a type of poison.
[02:47:34.931 --> 02:47:37.372]  By the way, I've just been handed some breaking news.
[02:47:37.372 --> 02:47:40.414]  I want to mention this very quickly and then we'll continue with you, Liz.
[02:47:40.414 --> 02:47:45.777]  FEMA puts out contract for emergency camps to house, quote, displaced citizens.
[02:47:45.777 --> 02:47:47.598]  This is an article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:47:47.598 --> 02:47:49.599]  It's posted on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:47:50.259 --> 02:47:52.260]  So go to InfoWars, check that out.
[02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:59.304]  I haven't read this article yet, but glancing over it here, it says the camps will be able to service up to 2,000 people at one time.
[02:47:59.304 --> 02:48:06.649]  It also indicates that the FEMA camp operations will be positioned in the context of social service.
[02:48:06.649 --> 02:48:07.809]  Yeah, we're going to help you.
[02:48:07.809 --> 02:48:09.290]  Come to our little camp.
[02:48:09.290 --> 02:48:12.012]  You can come in, but you can never leave.
[02:48:12.012 --> 02:48:13.813]  That's the kind of FEMA camp that they're setting up.
[02:48:14.393 --> 02:48:17.655]  Getting back to our callers, I apologize for that interruption there, Liz.
[02:48:17.655 --> 02:48:19.656]  We've got Marlon from Michigan on the phone.
[02:48:19.656 --> 02:48:23.059]  Marlon, go ahead with your question for Liz.
[02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:34.266]  Hi, yes, I was just wondering if you have had any exposure to camel milk and what's happening on that line.
[02:48:34.266 --> 02:48:36.507]  I'm actually a camel farmer.
[02:48:37.546 --> 02:48:42.992]  And we're having some really amazing benefits that we're seeing.
[02:48:42.992 --> 02:48:47.077]  Okay, your phone's kind of breaking up there, and I assume you're serious about this.
[02:48:47.077 --> 02:48:49.500]  It sounds kind of funny, maybe to many people.
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:52.123]  Liz, have you heard of any camel milk farmers out there?
[02:48:52.662 --> 02:48:53.143]  I have.
[02:48:53.143 --> 02:48:57.188]  I've heard of them and I've actually been to a farm that has camels that they milk.
[02:48:57.188 --> 02:49:02.435]  However, I have not personally had any of the camel milk, but I'm eager to try it.
[02:49:02.435 --> 02:49:07.943]  It sounds delightful and I've heard that it makes a very interesting fermented milk product.
[02:49:08.903 --> 02:49:10.785]  Well, that's something new that I learned.
[02:49:10.785 --> 02:49:12.127]  Thank you for that call, sir.
[02:49:12.127 --> 02:49:13.969]  Marlon, very interesting.
[02:49:13.969 --> 02:49:15.170]  Sorry about cutting you off.
[02:49:15.170 --> 02:49:17.873]  Your phone was very staticky.
[02:49:17.873 --> 02:49:28.625]  About that story, the FEMA announcement that's on InfoWars.com right now, I missed a key point, that the solicitation calls for the camps to be ready for occupancy within 72 hours.
[02:49:30.467 --> 02:49:38.189]  Now I don't know if that means 72 hours from now or 72 hours from some activation alert or some announcement.
[02:49:38.189 --> 02:49:40.770]  But clearly the timescale on this is accelerating.
[02:49:40.770 --> 02:49:43.130]  The FEMA camps are cranking up for operations.
[02:49:43.130 --> 02:49:46.831]  You can only imagine what that is in anticipation of.
[02:49:46.831 --> 02:49:49.732]  Something perhaps is coming down the line.
[02:49:49.732 --> 02:49:52.913]  Again, sorry for the interruption, Liz, we've got about a minute left in this.
[02:49:53.973 --> 02:49:55.254]  Time for one more call.
[02:49:55.254 --> 02:49:57.395]  Bregan in Wisconsin.
[02:49:57.395 --> 02:49:58.936]  You're on the phone.
[02:49:58.936 --> 02:50:01.697]  We're almost out of time, so go ahead quickly please.
[02:50:01.697 --> 02:50:03.058]  Hi Mike and Liz.
[02:50:03.058 --> 02:50:13.883]  I actually own a restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin and I've spoken with Max and Vernon in the past and I think I spoke with you actually last fall, Liz.
[02:50:13.883 --> 02:50:23.028]  We use organic products in our restaurant and I was wondering if Mike could talk about Justice Patrick J. Fiedler and the broader issue of
[02:50:23.860 --> 02:50:30.382]  Um, food rights and your inherent right to actually grow your own food, and I know Liz was following that as well.
[02:50:30.382 --> 02:50:32.723]  Well, let me put that to Liz, since she's our guest right now.
[02:50:32.723 --> 02:50:36.504]  Liz, you want to go ahead and address that in 30 seconds?
[02:50:36.504 --> 02:50:37.084]  That's tough.
[02:50:37.084 --> 02:50:39.765]  Well... Not to put you on the spot.
[02:50:39.765 --> 02:50:43.866]  We definitely have our rights, and included in that is procuring our own food.
[02:50:43.866 --> 02:50:47.687]  And if you're interested in learning more about it, we're having a... Ah, we gotta go to break.
[02:50:47.687 --> 02:50:48.727]  Sorry, Liz.
[02:50:48.727 --> 02:50:49.627]  Sorry to cut you off.
[02:50:49.627 --> 02:50:50.027]  Stay with us.
[02:50:50.027 --> 02:50:51.608]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:51:01.604 --> 02:51:06.067]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:51:06.067 --> 02:51:07.549]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:51:07.549 --> 02:51:16.456]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:51:16.456 --> 02:51:19.898]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:51:19.898 --> 02:51:20.959]  But take heart.
[02:51:20.959 --> 02:51:24.742]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:51:24.742 --> 02:51:29.706]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:51:30.126 --> 02:51:33.971]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:51:33.971 --> 02:51:35.693]  The globalists are scared.
[02:51:35.693 --> 02:51:37.034]  They've overreached.
[02:51:37.034 --> 02:51:40.539]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:52:05.594 --> 02:52:06.615]  That bears repeating.

[02:53:00.936 --> 02:53:03.778]  Powerful forces are trying to destroy your health.
[02:53:03.778 --> 02:53:17.727]  It's a fact that we're surrounded by a sea of environmental toxins, from mercury in vaccines and dental fillings, to aluminum in chemtrails, to pesticides and toxic chemicals sprayed all over our food, even nuclear radiation, which is still spewing out of Fukushima.
[02:53:17.867 --> 02:53:20.848]  Has contaminated the water and food supply in the U.S.
[02:53:20.848 --> 02:53:22.509]  But there is a solution.

[02:54:09.887 --> 02:54:14.630]  All right, we just wrapped up our interview with Liz Reitzig from rawmilkfreedomriders.com.
[02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:18.712]  I want to encourage all the Info Warriors out there to go to that website, check out the event details.
[02:54:18.712 --> 02:54:20.313]  That's coming up, what, 11 a.m.
[02:54:20.313 --> 02:54:22.434]  this Friday in Baraboo, Wisconsin?
[02:54:22.434 --> 02:54:23.054]  Please be there.
[02:54:23.054 --> 02:54:24.615]  Be part of this history in the making.
[02:54:25.135 --> 02:54:39.544]  Where the Declaration of Food Independence is going to be released, and I'm sure you'll hear a lot more about that statement, that announcement, that declaration here on InfoWars.com, as well as my website, Natural News.
[02:54:39.544 --> 02:54:40.764]  We'll be covering it both places.
[02:54:40.764 --> 02:54:44.587]  Some other breaking news I want to be sure to get to you today.
[02:54:45.547 --> 02:54:52.610]  I promised this earlier, the FAA has set a timetable now for allowing drones to be in the skies above America.
[02:54:52.610 --> 02:55:00.354]  September 30th, 2015 is the day that the nation's skies will be open to drones, even big drones.
[02:55:00.354 --> 02:55:13.219]  Now, the first step towards that comes in just 90 days, 90 days from today, when police, firefighters and other civilian first response agencies can start flying drones weighing no more than 4.4 pounds.
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:21.763]  And then by May 2013, that's going to be expanded to drones weighing less than 55 pounds.
[02:55:21.763 --> 02:55:29.606]  And then the full integration of drones, those are their words, full integration of drones, sounds very nice and peaceful, doesn't it?
[02:55:29.606 --> 02:55:30.246]  Into U.S.
[02:55:30.246 --> 02:55:31.306]  airspace on September 30th, 2015.
[02:55:33.283 --> 02:55:42.068]  So we are going to be inundated with spy drones looking into our backyards, looking into our gardens, watching every little move that we do in our lives.
[02:55:42.068 --> 02:55:44.129]  Now some other very important information to bring you.
[02:55:44.129 --> 02:55:48.152]  This is an article published in mcnews.com.
[02:55:48.152 --> 02:55:49.192]  It's called The Sting.
[02:55:49.192 --> 02:55:57.037]  It reveals that police all over the country are setting up fake construction zones and then writing speeding tickets.
[02:55:57.037 --> 02:56:01.380]  One fake construction zone in Washington State was able to write
[02:56:02.501 --> 02:56:10.228]  76 speeding tickets every, well, one ticket every two minutes for a total of $8,000 per hour being collected by the police there.
[02:56:10.228 --> 02:56:15.132]  The idea is working so well for these broke local governments that it's being set up in Denver, Colorado.
[02:56:15.132 --> 02:56:20.037]  There's a fake construction zone set up at the exit from the Denver International Airport.
[02:56:20.037 --> 02:56:21.238]  They trick you into thinking
[02:56:22.133 --> 02:56:23.715]  That's a 45 mile an hour zone.
[02:56:23.715 --> 02:56:30.082]  In fact, there's a little sign there drops to 25 miles an hour and it says fines are doubled because this is a construction zone.
[02:56:30.082 --> 02:56:31.343]  But there's no construction there.
[02:56:31.343 --> 02:56:38.732]  There's just a bunch of cops there waiting to write tickets by entrapping you in a false construction zone, a face construction zone.
[02:56:38.732 --> 02:56:43.277]  Also in Dallas, Texas, an investigation there has found that traffic cameras
[02:56:43.937 --> 02:56:57.805]  Are being combined with shortened duration of yellow lights to make sure that you run the yellow light or you run the red light effectively because the yellow light is shortened in order to generate revenue on that camera.
[02:56:57.805 --> 02:57:05.810]  One camera that generated 9,407 tickets worth over $700,000 between January and August of last year.
[02:57:05.810 --> 02:57:07.171]  So that's what it's come to, folks.
[02:57:07.171 --> 02:57:08.071]  Forget your freedoms.
[02:57:08.071 --> 02:57:08.952]  Forget law.
[02:57:08.952 --> 02:57:10.412]  It's all revenue generation.
[02:57:10.412 --> 02:57:12.674]  Just another way to trap you into paying more of your money.
[02:57:13.474 --> 02:57:14.135]  To the state.
[02:57:14.135 --> 02:57:16.237]  Now, I've got one more thing to announce.
[02:57:16.237 --> 02:57:19.961]  I just finished a mini-documentary called False Environmentalism.
[02:57:19.961 --> 02:57:23.384]  And I want to roll the first 60 seconds of that for you so you get a look at that.
[02:57:23.384 --> 02:57:25.045]  You can find this on YouTube.com.
[02:57:25.045 --> 02:57:27.308]  Just search for False Environmentalism.
[02:57:27.308 --> 02:57:27.928]  Go ahead and roll that.
[02:57:27.928 --> 02:57:28.489]  I want you to see it.
[02:57:34.187 --> 02:57:41.491]  Are you fed up with false environmentalism that says we have to stop breathing in order to save the planet?
[02:57:41.491 --> 02:57:51.738]  Here are five things you can do right now to really save the environment without giving up your freedom or surrendering to oppressive government mandates.
[02:57:52.634 --> 02:57:56.096]  And these five things are probably not what you think.
[02:57:56.096 --> 02:58:03.241]  Many people, for example, think that changing their light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights will save the planet.
[02:58:03.241 --> 02:58:06.543]  And they applaud the government's light bulb mandates.
[02:58:06.543 --> 02:58:09.986]  But CFLs are loaded with toxic mercury.
[02:58:09.986 --> 02:58:17.270]  And when you throw them away, they release mercury directly into local landfills and water aquifers.
[02:58:17.270 --> 02:58:22.254]  Or you might think you could save the planet by driving the much coveted Toyota Prius.
[02:58:23.014 --> 02:58:23.754]  Alright there.
[02:58:23.754 --> 02:58:25.195]  Check that out on YouTube.com.
[02:58:25.195 --> 02:58:27.416]  Thank you for joining us today.
