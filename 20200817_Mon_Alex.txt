[00:30.000 --> 00:39.080]  Okay, here's the final equation.
[00:39.080 --> 00:41.200]  This is the end of the world as we know it.
[00:41.200 --> 00:47.000]  This is an overwrite of the entire biosphere and every species on the planet.
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.040]  I've studied the entire neural loader operation and that's what it is.
[00:52.040 --> 00:56.800]  And everything has been psychologically war-gamed, where unless the public completely wakes up
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.000]  and rejects it all wholesale, it will succeed.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.400]  And of course, we know that God will intervene at the end and it is laid out because the
[01:06.400 --> 01:09.160]  group doing this is not the supreme being.
[01:09.160 --> 01:16.960]  It is a very nasty group of entities that the Bible tells us about, a military force.
[01:16.960 --> 01:21.320]  Now ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of everything.
[01:21.320 --> 01:23.480]  It's never coming back.
[01:23.480 --> 01:26.440]  The prosperity is never coming back.
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.320]  It's all over.
[01:28.320 --> 01:33.000]  And they're going to, by increments, put the pressure on, get you to give up more rights
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.760]  and then they'll take a little pressure off.
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.840]  And then they'll tell you, give up more rights and then pressure will be taken off.
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.880]  But then always it will be put back on even tighter.
[01:42.880 --> 01:46.040]  That's the psychology of this takeover.
[01:46.040 --> 01:50.360]  And to watch Bill Gates on all these TV shows saying it's never coming back, it's going
[01:50.360 --> 01:51.800]  to be really hurt bad.
[01:51.800 --> 01:56.440]  He starts laughing and giggling with Bilderberg group members.
[01:56.440 --> 02:02.280]  These people are openly evil and they're not even hiding it.
[02:02.280 --> 02:05.920]  And they tell you, oh, you're going to have five shots a year just for COVID and they're
[02:05.920 --> 02:07.200]  not going to help you.
[02:07.200 --> 02:10.920]  Oh, and vaccines do hurt you.
[02:10.920 --> 02:12.200]  We used to tell you they didn't hurt you.
[02:12.200 --> 02:13.200]  You know, they do hurt you.
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.640]  Oh, and these new ones change your DNA and we don't know what's going to happen, but
[02:17.640 --> 02:20.200]  we're just doing it.
[02:20.200 --> 02:25.640]  That's the psychology of Stockholm syndrome where they are shocking you and torturing
[02:25.640 --> 02:30.760]  you and getting you to do outrageous things, knowing you're going to bow to them and become
[02:30.760 --> 02:34.880]  a coward out of fear and rationalize what they're doing.
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.760]  So this is all a very deliberate operation.
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.440]  Like when they say there is no such thing as antifa, there is no violence in the streets.
[02:44.440 --> 02:47.760]  Give us $25 billion at the post office so we can rig the election.
[02:47.760 --> 02:54.040]  If you don't give us $25 billion and have illegal mail-in voting, then you are a fascist and
[02:54.040 --> 03:02.560]  we've got to have an emergency session in Congress during a campaign never before done.
[03:02.560 --> 03:05.560]  So it's all going over the edge.
[03:05.560 --> 03:12.960]  So the most important thing you can do and I can do is understand what Netflix is.
[03:12.960 --> 03:13.960]  Think about that.
[03:13.960 --> 03:16.960]  How there's really nothing old on Netflix.
[03:16.960 --> 03:22.840]  It's all new and all bad and all debilitating so that everyone forgets the past and now
[03:22.840 --> 03:29.200]  all the shows they're wearing masks and the video games and the movies suddenly it's permanent.
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.280]  And if you'll have a suffocating mask over your face that rots your teeth and doesn't
[03:32.280 --> 03:37.760]  protect you and gives you hypoxia and all the rest of it and you don't get enough air
[03:37.760 --> 03:43.840]  and it lowers your oxygen by 20%, that alone causes brain damage long-term.
[03:43.840 --> 03:45.320]  They can do anything.
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.840]  And they admit, Gates came out and said, here's the future, forced inoculations tracking everywhere
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.800]  you go and sorry, we're going to get rid of the tourism industry pretty much and that's
[03:55.800 --> 03:57.640]  just we're going to have a post-industrial world.
[03:57.640 --> 04:05.480]  So the headline at infowars.com today is the lockdown is never going to end.
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.240]  Welcome to the post-industrial world, which is the post-human world.
[04:09.240 --> 04:10.920]  And it's all in the Gen of 21.
[04:10.920 --> 04:11.920]  It's all in the Gen of 2030.
[04:11.920 --> 04:12.920]  It's all public.
[04:12.920 --> 04:14.960]  And they even say on the news, oh, it's for the earth now.
[04:14.960 --> 04:22.320]  And it's teaching us to redistribute wealth, yeah, to the ultra rich and the public has
[04:22.320 --> 04:23.320]  lost God.
[04:23.320 --> 04:24.880]  So they've lost a mooring.
[04:24.880 --> 04:35.600]  And so mental illness and insanity is spreading like wildfire and guard your soul, folks.
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.160]  That's all I can tell you, guard your soul above everything else, fear not who can kill
[04:39.160 --> 04:41.720]  the body, but you can kill the soul.
[04:41.720 --> 04:47.200]  This is just going to be one hell of a nightmare, but in the end, all of the delusion will be
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.800]  removed and every head will bow, every knee will bend to God.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  Stay with us.
[04:53.800 --> 05:04.800]  We'll be right back incrementalism, the inchworm effect, successive approximation.
[05:04.800 --> 05:09.560]  First they tell you only stay in your house for 15 days to the hospitals can stay empty.
[05:09.560 --> 05:10.560]  That was all a fraud.
[05:10.560 --> 05:12.480]  Then wear a mask for a month.
[05:12.480 --> 05:17.920]  Here we are six months later, then they start making people at colleges and at big corporations
[05:17.920 --> 05:24.360]  where wristbands showing that they've been quote, contact traced and tested for COVID.
[05:24.360 --> 05:29.040]  Then comes the apps on your phones and the global social credit score now being rolled
[05:29.040 --> 05:31.800]  out by Virginia, California and others.
[05:31.800 --> 05:32.800]  It's not coming.
[05:32.800 --> 05:33.800]  It's here.
[05:33.800 --> 05:34.800]  And then the inoculations.
[05:34.800 --> 05:39.120]  If you ever want to leave your house, which amounts to forced inoculations.
[05:39.120 --> 05:41.680]  This is the medical tyranny takeover.
[05:41.680 --> 05:44.400]  These are not classic vaccines that have their own problems.
[05:44.400 --> 05:50.520]  These are DNA vaccines that change your DNA and are having massive, serious side effects.
[05:50.520 --> 05:53.120]  Guaranteed this is about depopulation.
[05:53.120 --> 05:57.200]  Bill Gates admits that this is an emergency, resist or die.
[05:57.200 --> 06:14.200]  The New World Order is here.
[06:14.200 --> 06:16.200]  I don't come here with bad news.
[06:16.200 --> 06:18.560]  I just come here with a simple plain facts.
[06:18.560 --> 06:24.440]  We're on a planet hurtling through deep space, orbiting a beautiful sun, giving all these
[06:24.440 --> 06:28.400]  gifts by our creator, but we have free will.
[06:28.400 --> 06:37.200]  And so there is a spirit, a program, an operation that seeks to enslave us and turn us into
[06:37.200 --> 06:49.920]  gnome like suboid servants that will build a universe in the image of Lucifer.
[06:49.920 --> 06:53.080]  And that's what we're in the middle of.
[06:53.080 --> 07:02.240]  So again, thank you for joining us on this live teleprompter free August 17th, 2020 worldwide
[07:02.240 --> 07:03.240]  transmission.
[07:03.240 --> 07:08.800]  Oh, I've got a lot of interesting news, a lot of amazing little factoids and things
[07:08.800 --> 07:13.000]  to cover.
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.200]  There's always the cotton candy of the Durham investigation and, you know, the popcorn of
[07:20.200 --> 07:23.720]  people being jerked out of their vehicles and beaten to death or half to death or shot
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.840]  in the head and the media saying it's good.
[07:28.840 --> 07:33.800]  And there's all the wondrous cancer statistics of pediatric cancer, up 50,000 percent from
[07:33.800 --> 07:37.840]  what it was in the sixties.
[07:37.840 --> 07:43.320]  And there's all the myriad censorship and control and AI overlords watching our every
[07:43.320 --> 07:52.200]  move and all the skexie like servants of the devil, cackling and hissing and slithering
[07:52.200 --> 07:56.280]  around all completely empty and alone.
[07:56.280 --> 08:01.040]  Now there's the headline, the lockdown is permanent.
[08:01.040 --> 08:04.240]  Welcome to the post industrial world, Monday Live.
[08:04.240 --> 08:08.560]  Bill Gates has publicly announced that the lockdown will never end and forced inoculations
[08:08.560 --> 08:10.520]  are on the way.
[08:10.520 --> 08:17.880]  And you watch that video with him on Fareed Zarkaria, let's play that segment.
[08:17.880 --> 08:20.760]  Fareed reads a script back at him and says, it's really bad.
[08:20.760 --> 08:21.760]  It's going to last years.
[08:21.760 --> 08:26.280]  People are going to get used to it and Gates starts getting really excited.
[08:26.280 --> 08:29.800]  And if you read the fine print of what he says, he goes, well, it never goes back to
[08:29.800 --> 08:30.800]  normal.
[08:30.800 --> 08:36.800]  But in the industrialized areas, you're going to be allowed to go to a restaurant by the
[08:36.800 --> 08:44.880]  middle of 21, 2021.
[08:44.880 --> 08:49.920]  And oh, but you know, the smaller businesses are going to have to be closed forever and
[08:49.920 --> 08:53.000]  only travel that's essential is going to be allowed and you're going to have to take a
[08:53.000 --> 08:54.000]  microchip to do that.
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.160]  And it's all being announced by his surrogates.
[08:59.160 --> 09:04.720]  And then he comes and announces most of it on TV, but then has his surrogates say, oh,
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.560]  but you don't know Jeffrey Epstein and oh, you don't want to put a microchip in anybody.
[09:09.560 --> 09:14.440]  And Bill Gates is like, that's right because it's not called a microchip.
[09:14.440 --> 09:15.440]  It's nanotech.
[09:15.440 --> 09:21.280]  And if you actually read the tech publications, it's everywhere.
[09:21.280 --> 09:24.400]  The future of tech is in your skin.
[09:24.400 --> 09:25.400]  Everybody's going to get it.
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.400]  It's just a bandage.
[09:26.400 --> 09:27.400]  It's so easy.
[09:27.400 --> 09:29.080]  And it just puts little chips into your skin.
[09:29.080 --> 09:30.440]  They work their way in.
[09:30.440 --> 09:31.440]  Yay.
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.480]  Imagine if aliens landed and said, come, if you want your food, put on this patch.
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.480]  It's easy.
[09:36.480 --> 09:37.880]  I'm putting something in you to help you.
[09:37.880 --> 09:39.040]  It's just a tattoo.
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.000]  You know, tattoos are fun, but you can't see this one, but the computer can.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  Everything's fine.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.680]  We're your friends.
[09:46.680 --> 09:54.000]  And now, oh, in Europe and in China, when you show up at the grocery store, they weigh
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.120]  you to decide if you're too fat to get food and it's all on your social credit score.
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.280]  But then when they first do it, they apologize, oh, we don't know why the government had people
[10:03.280 --> 10:05.400]  out at the grocery store.
[10:05.400 --> 10:07.000]  It was a test gone wrong.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.480]  And then, oh, then the next time, well, yeah, we're doing it.
[10:09.480 --> 10:13.440]  Because see, they know when they announce, hey, we're going to be there weighing you
[10:13.440 --> 10:16.760]  at the grocery store or the restaurant, you're going to know that's crazy, oh, I'm going
[10:16.760 --> 10:17.760]  to fight that.
[10:17.760 --> 10:18.760]  They go, oh, we're doing it.
[10:18.760 --> 10:19.760]  Oh, it's an accident.
[10:19.760 --> 10:20.760]  And then that way.
[10:20.760 --> 10:21.760]  Okay.
[10:21.760 --> 10:23.160]  And the next time, oh, we are doing it, but not everybody.
[10:23.160 --> 10:25.040]  You get a coupon if you let us do it.
[10:25.040 --> 10:26.920]  And then, oh, everybody has to do it.
[10:26.920 --> 10:29.520]  And if you don't want to, you can go sign up over here.
[10:29.520 --> 10:30.520]  We'll put you on a list.
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.280]  Oh, you don't want the vaccine?
[10:32.280 --> 10:33.280]  Sure.
[10:33.280 --> 10:34.280]  Just get on a list over here.
[10:34.280 --> 10:35.280]  Oh, sorry.
[10:35.280 --> 10:38.080]  We're sending contact tracers to your house to take your kids because you're not giving
[10:38.080 --> 10:39.080]  them the inoculation.
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.200]  It's all been battle planned, but they know how to get our laziness.
[10:45.200 --> 10:48.480]  They know how to manipulate that.
[10:48.480 --> 10:55.160]  They know how to incrementally get us to put the change on ourselves.
[10:55.160 --> 11:02.120]  So the chains are going on and the stated plan by the United Nations and by the Club
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.160]  of Rome and by the Bilderberg group and by the Davos group is a post-human world.
[11:07.160 --> 11:09.400]  And they're now externalizing the hierarchy.
[11:09.400 --> 11:10.440]  They're externalizing the method.
[11:10.440 --> 11:16.600]  They're externalizing the inner cult vision of, hey, like I told you in in-game, low-level,
[11:16.600 --> 11:22.240]  they say we're going to kill 80%, oh, you're part of the 20%, you'll be all right.
[11:22.240 --> 11:24.400]  And then higher level, they go, well, it's really about 90.
[11:24.400 --> 11:27.840]  Dr. Pionka once at 90% killed, head of the biology department at the time at UT.
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.120]  And then one of his graduate students that works at level four bio-weapon lab in California,
[11:31.120 --> 11:34.600]  she wrote an op-ed saying, listen, Pionka is too liberal.
[11:34.600 --> 11:35.600]  Humans are a parasite.
[11:35.600 --> 11:38.200]  We're going to transcend our bodies and merge with machines.
[11:38.200 --> 11:39.720]  And then she works at a bio-weapon facility.
[11:39.720 --> 11:45.340]  So see, that's not 12 monkeys, a fictional movie where the exterminist animal rights
[11:45.340 --> 11:48.200]  activists wants to depopulate the earth.
[11:48.200 --> 11:51.480]  And he works at a bio-weapon lab.
[11:51.480 --> 11:54.360]  They really work at the bio-weapon labs and they tell you, we don't care.
[11:54.360 --> 11:57.720]  But kill your ass.
[11:57.720 --> 11:59.720]  And Bill Gates says there's too many of us.
[11:59.720 --> 12:05.680]  And then Bill Gates is our doctor now and it's, oh, Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, New York
[12:05.680 --> 12:09.800]  Times, CNN, ABC, NBC, every channel, BBC, it's just even in China.
[12:09.800 --> 12:13.920]  Bill Gates is on the TV and he's like, and you're going to have this and you're going
[12:13.920 --> 12:15.400]  to take the inoculation.
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.120]  Adults get five, children get two, and there's going to be new plagues, terrorists are about
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.120]  to release it.
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.120]  This was really a drill.
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.000]  And then everybody's smiling and laughing, and Stephen Colbert, you can tell, is totally
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  scared.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.400]  And they all agreed to him because they're all, now no, oh, they were never going to
[12:31.400 --> 12:34.200]  get rid of 80%.
[12:34.200 --> 12:37.040]  They're going to kill everybody.
[12:37.040 --> 12:41.520]  Because the way this thing works is one person gets to live.
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.080]  If there were two neural-order globalists in a tower, they would kill each other.
[12:47.080 --> 12:50.160]  Now you're entering the mind of Satan.
[12:50.160 --> 12:54.480]  Satan doesn't want slaves, Satan wants you dead.
[12:54.480 --> 13:05.600]  The ultimate control is to kill you so that you cannot develop and then die and then your
[13:05.600 --> 13:07.800]  spirit transcends to the next level.
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.960]  It needs to put you into an artificial reality, totally make you satanic and evil, kill your
[13:12.960 --> 13:17.120]  body to trap you with it forever.
[13:17.120 --> 13:24.880]  And Satan wants to be able to operate in multi-dimensions, and so we are the gateway
[13:24.880 --> 13:26.560]  for Satan to run that operation.
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.520]  And so that's why all these fools, the left thinks, oh, we're locking things down to defeat
[13:32.520 --> 13:33.520]  Trump.
[13:33.520 --> 13:34.520]  That's just one facet.
[13:34.520 --> 13:36.040]  This plan has been on the shelf for decades.
[13:36.040 --> 13:37.040]  They admit it.
[13:37.040 --> 13:38.280]  They're implementing it now.
[13:38.280 --> 13:39.880]  They're tailoring it for politics.
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.600]  But it's for everybody, and it's the left that's losing their jobs the most, that's
[13:44.600 --> 13:49.560]  in the highest crime that's living in hell, but again, like Stockholm, they go out and
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.200]  rage against people in the countryside or people that have a farm.
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.200]  You see all the news.
[13:54.200 --> 13:58.840]  Yeah, the pieces of crap living in rural areas, they're out in sunshine and walking on their
[13:58.840 --> 13:59.840]  own property.
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.200]  Yeah, because their families were smart and didn't want to live in a big evil city.
[14:04.200 --> 14:07.400]  And then they live in a shack, but they're living better than the richest person in some
[14:07.400 --> 14:11.680]  devilish high-rise, and it's all going to be taken.
[14:11.680 --> 14:14.640]  So the move, I was the selfish person.
[14:14.640 --> 14:17.440]  I'd sell everything I got.
[14:17.440 --> 14:24.760]  I'd get plastic surgery, and I would run to somewhere like the inner mountain region
[14:24.760 --> 14:28.920]  of the Western part of the United States, and you'd never see me again.
[14:28.920 --> 14:36.440]  I'd be 100 miles from nowhere behind a hill with a shack and then a bunker underneath
[14:36.440 --> 14:45.600]  it and with a radio and a little farm, gone, gone, gone, because, and that's the wimpy
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.720]  thing to do, but not join Satan but run and hide, and they're going to come there.
[14:50.720 --> 14:52.120]  The robots are going to come there.
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.280]  The drones are going to come there.
[14:56.280 --> 15:03.440]  And that's why none of the globals are having children, because they're already scared enough
[15:03.440 --> 15:06.720]  themselves, the ones that aren't pure Satanists, and they know it's over.
[15:06.720 --> 15:07.720]  It's over.
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  Well, you know what?
[15:08.720 --> 15:09.720]  I'm having more children if I can.
[15:09.720 --> 15:14.920]  I'm doubling down on God and on our children and on us, because I need to put them in the
[15:14.920 --> 15:19.480]  world because I love them so much so that they are in danger to this, so I don't bow
[15:19.480 --> 15:24.240]  down to Satan because it's their soul that matters.
[15:24.240 --> 15:25.240]  That's how you're all in.
[15:25.240 --> 15:27.960]  You don't tie in the ground.
[15:27.960 --> 15:28.960]  You stand up.
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.080]  Now, if you've got a family and it's your mission to protect yourselves and get out,
[15:32.080 --> 15:36.680]  and then support the resistance as much as you can, there's ways to be balanced about
[15:36.680 --> 15:37.680]  it.
[15:37.680 --> 15:41.560]  I'm just simply telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that giving up on society and civilizations
[15:41.560 --> 15:46.760]  what the enemy wants to really capture us and accelerate this, Satan's going to get
[15:46.760 --> 15:52.320]  his one year or so of power and going to kill billions of people, but in the end, they're
[15:52.320 --> 15:53.320]  going to be defeated.
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.720]  This whole AI thing is going down, and Bill Gates will pay.
[15:56.720 --> 16:00.160]  I'm going to say something right now, but it's one of the most important things I've
[16:00.160 --> 16:03.400]  ever said, so please listen very, very carefully.
[16:03.400 --> 16:09.280]  Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or had the lockdown.
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.880]  They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Bill and Melinda Gates.
[16:13.880 --> 16:16.240]  It is beyond critical.
[16:16.240 --> 16:18.560]  It is life and death for you and your family to understand, no matter where you live on
[16:18.560 --> 16:25.320]  the planet, that this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never
[16:25.320 --> 16:27.000]  going to end.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.920]  The United Nations has admitted that, first it's a month, then it's six months, then they
[16:30.920 --> 16:32.680]  say, okay, it's two years.
[16:32.680 --> 16:35.120]  They're now saying two years.
[16:35.120 --> 16:37.840]  They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[16:37.840 --> 16:42.680]  No more gatherings, no more anything, constant force inoculations that they admit don't
[16:42.680 --> 16:43.680]  even work.
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.240]  And the way they say they work, they change your DNA.
[16:47.240 --> 16:50.320]  This is the culling of the planet.
[16:50.320 --> 16:54.120]  This is the beginning of the straitjacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured
[16:54.120 --> 16:55.520]  to death and killed.
[16:55.520 --> 16:57.760]  You understand?
[16:57.760 --> 17:01.040]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[17:01.040 --> 17:06.760]  Well, you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[17:06.760 --> 17:10.480]  the speaker of the House that you are legitimately now the president.
[17:10.480 --> 17:13.240]  That's what she's said on CBS News.
[17:13.240 --> 17:15.640]  And that you're going to have those blue states secede.
[17:15.640 --> 17:19.680]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:19.680 --> 17:24.480]  And the Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood, the chai comms, and the whole globalist system.
[17:24.480 --> 17:29.680]  This is treason with a capital T. And our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards,
[17:29.680 --> 17:33.560]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything, even though our president has been
[17:33.560 --> 17:34.560]  exposing it.
[17:34.560 --> 17:35.560]  But here's the bottom line.
[17:35.560 --> 17:37.080]  You need storeable food.
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.040]  We've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now, two- to four-week delivery.
[17:41.040 --> 17:44.600]  With 80 days out from the election, you need to get high-quality storeable food right now
[17:44.600 --> 17:46.400]  in case they are able to pull this off.
[17:46.400 --> 17:49.600]  We're going to have a Great Depression war on the streets that will make a road warrior
[17:49.600 --> 17:50.600]  look like a cake and walk.
[17:50.600 --> 17:53.560]  Get your high-quality storeable foods now and get ready and get prepared.
[17:53.560 --> 18:00.560]  At infowarstore.com, get prepared.
[18:23.560 --> 18:53.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones, websites are infowars.com and newswars.com.
[18:54.560 --> 18:59.280]  So here's how it works.
[18:59.280 --> 19:07.680]  When somebody gets straight A's across the board in high school and they've got databases
[19:07.680 --> 19:13.040]  on genealogies and a lot of other things they do, you get approached to go to one of these
[19:13.040 --> 19:16.840]  advanced academies at a college.
[19:16.840 --> 19:21.760]  And then larger groups get tested there for aptitude.
[19:21.760 --> 19:29.760]  And then when you're about 15 or 16, they recruit you to be part of a scientific force
[19:29.760 --> 19:32.400]  trying to save the earth.
[19:32.400 --> 19:35.880]  And so you've been brought in, you're saving the earth, you're a good guy, and by increments
[19:35.880 --> 19:41.600]  they have a psychological table where they walk you into the position by the time you're
[19:41.600 --> 19:46.400]  about 18 that you believe that we have to take control of the planet, we have to reduce
[19:46.400 --> 19:50.680]  the population because we're the ruling class and eugenics is the way to go because humanity
[19:50.680 --> 19:54.440]  is degenerating and falling apart.
[19:54.440 --> 19:58.760]  And then, of course, they don't explain to you that they're engineering the culture crisis
[19:58.760 --> 20:03.240]  and breaking up the family and putting things in the water to lower IQ and greasing the
[20:03.240 --> 20:07.680]  skids for the decadence that was already going to come in an industrial society that takes
[20:07.680 --> 20:12.600]  people off the land where they have to work to produce their own food.
[20:12.600 --> 20:24.800]  And so they didn't just build this industrial system by accident and make it to where babies
[20:24.800 --> 20:30.040]  sleep in cribs, babies get formulas, babies get vaccines, babies get removed from their
[20:30.040 --> 20:35.880]  parents, babies are disassociated, babies are basically more like robots by the time
[20:35.880 --> 20:40.480]  they grow up because they've been dehumanized.
[20:40.480 --> 20:47.720]  There was a track of the Renaissance building machines, building science, building the Gutenberg
[20:47.720 --> 20:51.960]  Press 500 years ago that caused an enlightenment.
[20:51.960 --> 21:00.320]  But parallel to the enlightenment was the dark force twisting the light so that it would
[21:00.320 --> 21:05.600]  be able to then get full control of us and make us dependent on it.
[21:05.600 --> 21:10.960]  And so now they are destroying the old Renaissance track and they're jumping us over to the train
[21:10.960 --> 21:12.880]  to hell.
[21:12.880 --> 21:17.760]  And that's really what I just wanted to get across to everybody, that lying to yourself
[21:17.760 --> 21:23.640]  about this and living in denial is only going to make it worse.
[21:23.640 --> 21:29.240]  And again, I read this stuff 30 years ago and found it absolutely wild and thought the
[21:29.240 --> 21:32.560]  elite's delusional, they really won't try to pull this off.
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.520]  But then I watched them pull it off, pull it off, pull it off.
[21:36.520 --> 21:39.840]  And then I'm like, oh, they're about five, six years behind, they're 2020, to launch
[21:39.840 --> 21:44.800]  the beginning of the post-industrial world, the depopulation, the end of the family.
[21:44.800 --> 21:51.000]  In the UK, they arrest you if you say there aren't unlimited genders because they're going
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.200]  to have human robots, they're going to have clones.
[21:54.200 --> 22:05.000]  And they're going to say that they've all got rights because the government, the system
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.960]  will speak for them and they'll be programmed by the system.
[22:09.960 --> 22:17.080]  The corporations want to build crops of humans as the machines, just like Blade Runner.
[22:17.080 --> 22:19.520]  But that's only one level of the deception.
[22:19.520 --> 22:24.880]  Just the technocrats, the transhumanists that want to live forever being told, oh, there's
[22:24.880 --> 22:29.000]  too many people, they're dumbed down, we got to get rid of most of them.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.040]  And then once we've gotten rid of most of them, you know, there'll be a new golden future
[22:34.040 --> 22:40.560]  and it'll be like Zardos, where we'll have these hunter killers that go out and keep
[22:40.560 --> 22:42.960]  the population of the wild humans down.
[22:42.960 --> 22:48.120]  And then we're going to live in these advanced estates more like in the ancient Greek times
[22:48.120 --> 22:51.920]  or Elysium.
[22:51.920 --> 22:56.160]  You know, where do they come with a movie like Zardos with Sean Connery when we run
[22:56.160 --> 22:58.040]  some of the trailer?
[22:58.040 --> 23:05.120]  Well, that came out right after the Club of Rome created its secret report in the early
[23:05.120 --> 23:10.440]  1960s and by then it was public and they circulated and they made a movie about it.
[23:10.440 --> 23:15.200]  Now, of course, that was getting old elitist in the 60s to sign on to we're going to kill
[23:15.200 --> 23:20.640]  almost everybody and we'll hunt down the other people's like a Hunger Games original
[23:20.640 --> 23:25.720]  and then we'll just be elites on our beautiful plantations and live forever.
[23:25.720 --> 23:28.240]  And so they kind of bought into that worldview.
[23:28.240 --> 23:32.640]  But now that you get closer to it, they go, nah, all humans are really parasites.
[23:32.640 --> 23:34.280]  We have to get rid of the species.
[23:34.280 --> 23:36.680]  Well, who is behind this?
[23:36.680 --> 23:41.400]  You don't just think another human's directing this, do you?
[23:41.400 --> 23:45.160]  This is Hitler squared to infinity.
[23:45.160 --> 23:54.560]  This is, type in Zardos trailer to YouTube, Zardos, Zardana, maybe that's why you can't
[23:54.560 --> 23:55.560]  find it.
[23:55.560 --> 23:56.560]  Maybe I can find it.
[23:56.560 --> 23:59.520]  There was my phone on there.
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.120]  So that's where all of this is going.
[24:03.120 --> 24:13.640]  And we're being completely and totally domesticated for that.
[24:13.640 --> 24:25.120]  And I can sit here and I can cover other news and I can talk about this or that or this
[24:25.120 --> 24:27.800]  interesting factoid or how they're not going to have the debates.
[24:27.800 --> 24:28.880]  They're going to be video conference.
[24:28.880 --> 24:36.120]  I knew that was coming.
[24:36.120 --> 24:47.200]  But it's all window dressing, ladies and gentlemen, it's all it is.
[24:47.200 --> 24:58.120]  So I sit there and I look at Bill Gates, what Hitler wished he could be.
[24:58.120 --> 25:04.440]  And I just sit here and I watch how the public's been turned so evil like their master is that
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.600]  it'll be a blessing when everybody gets killed.
[25:08.600 --> 25:12.480]  Because that's how this weird sick, Illuminati balance works is they get us to be evil.
[25:12.480 --> 25:13.560]  They get us to be selfish.
[25:13.560 --> 25:16.360]  They get us to go along and say we're heroes wearing masks.
[25:16.360 --> 25:19.920]  They get us to bind our own destruction.
[25:19.920 --> 25:24.640]  And then by the time we are all destroying ourselves, they sit back and they laugh about
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.440]  it when they help set the whole thing up.
[25:28.440 --> 25:37.120]  And that's how they metaphysically think that they get away with it.
[25:37.120 --> 25:42.160]  And you know, I've said this before, I can see their Darwinian social Darwinian angles
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.760]  from a scientific perspective, but it's all false data because they're the worst people
[25:46.760 --> 25:47.760]  on earth.
[25:47.760 --> 25:49.440]  Their kids commit suicide at record levels.
[25:49.440 --> 25:50.680]  They're totally unhappy.
[25:50.680 --> 25:53.520]  I've been around some of these billionaire kids.
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.640]  I mean, the real ones, okay, you're talking cursed people, all of them.
[25:57.640 --> 26:01.280]  They're cursed, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:01.280 --> 26:03.160]  And Trump knows joining them as a curse.
[26:03.160 --> 26:05.920]  It's why he's not in bed with them.
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.560]  But he's got one leg with him, one leg out, because that's what it is to be on this planet
[26:09.560 --> 26:13.920]  now.
[26:13.920 --> 26:19.360]  And so you've got the twisted version of the hierarchy up on top.
[26:19.360 --> 26:23.680]  And then as you go down the hierarchy, it just gets more disgusting and a more stupid
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.760]  version of what's on top to where they force those of us that are not part of the Illuminati
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.760]  to be in the same position, looking at our watch, knowing how bad it's going to get,
[26:34.760 --> 26:38.160]  and going right about now, they're going to release that bio weapon to wipe most of these
[26:38.160 --> 26:39.160]  guys out.
[26:39.160 --> 26:40.160]  Damn, I wish we could have woke them up.
[26:40.160 --> 26:43.680]  But let me just get below ground as quickly as possible and hope they don't send a hundred
[26:43.680 --> 26:45.920]  killer robots in here in six months to get me.
[26:45.920 --> 26:47.760]  I mean, that's basically it.
[26:47.760 --> 26:49.600]  We're all right in our own death warrant.
[26:49.600 --> 26:52.200]  Hey, listen, you're all dead.
[26:52.200 --> 26:53.200]  Most of you are dead already.
[26:53.200 --> 26:55.040]  They already put it in you.
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.360]  Just a few months ago, almost every storeable food manufacturer was sold out.
[26:59.360 --> 27:02.560]  They were still taking people's orders, and many of the companies have still not fulfilled
[27:02.560 --> 27:03.560]  them.
[27:03.560 --> 27:05.200]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.
[27:05.200 --> 27:09.200]  Our suppliers the best, the highest quality, the best containers to transport it as well.
[27:09.200 --> 27:12.880]  And they've got the food with four factories in stock, takes them two to four weeks to
[27:12.880 --> 27:14.400]  get it shipped out to you.
[27:14.400 --> 27:16.440]  You need to order your storeable food now.
[27:16.440 --> 27:18.080]  The world is much more dire.
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.840]  The economic system is collapsing.
[27:19.840 --> 27:21.680]  The third world's already starving to death.
[27:21.680 --> 27:23.760]  Food prices are exploding here.
[27:23.760 --> 27:27.920]  The farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the COVID hoax.
[27:27.920 --> 27:31.880]  You need to get your storeable food while you still can at infowarstore.com, so 360
[27:31.880 --> 27:32.880]  win.
[27:32.880 --> 27:33.880]  It also funds our operation.
[27:33.880 --> 27:36.920]  But you need to get it, whether it's three months, six months, a year, you need to get
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.960]  that now and have that checkbox off of being prepared and being self-sufficient.
[27:40.960 --> 27:44.720]  We also have high quality water filtration and air filtration at infowarstore.com.
[27:44.720 --> 27:45.720]  They're absolute must.
[27:45.720 --> 27:50.080]  Whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, don't wait until a bigger crisis comes.
[27:50.080 --> 27:51.880]  Don't wait until everybody panics.
[27:51.880 --> 27:52.880]  Take action, get ready now.
[27:52.880 --> 28:02.120]  You hear that?
[28:02.120 --> 28:08.080]  That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation coming
[28:08.080 --> 28:14.360]  with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations and
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.240]  the permanent lockdown of civilization and society.
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.800]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[28:21.800 --> 28:24.960]  They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place.
[28:24.960 --> 28:27.600]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[28:27.600 --> 28:32.840]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed
[28:32.840 --> 28:41.520]  by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft.
[28:41.520 --> 28:43.840]  It's a final frontier.
[28:43.840 --> 28:46.560]  It's the year 2020.
[28:46.560 --> 28:48.680]  It's not coming.
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.680]  It's here.
[28:49.680 --> 28:54.840]  And submission is blood in the water.
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.120]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert.
[28:58.120 --> 29:02.040]  As of taking this alert, we're 82 days out from the election.
[29:02.040 --> 29:06.400]  As many of you know in the last year, I pointed out statements out of the Council on Foreign
[29:06.400 --> 29:11.640]  Relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win in a landslide.
[29:11.640 --> 29:17.360]  So their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it.
[29:17.360 --> 29:22.200]  Then they are openly now wargaming, which is in the New York Times, having Democrat states
[29:22.200 --> 29:27.880]  and cities secede from the union just like they've ignored Trump's policies and coronavirus
[29:27.880 --> 29:29.640]  and kept their areas locked down.
[29:29.640 --> 29:32.040]  That is nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[29:32.040 --> 29:35.760]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in DC.
[29:35.760 --> 29:41.600]  They said in another city, Colossia said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Hawks.
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war.
[29:46.280 --> 29:48.480]  This is their public criminal plan.
[29:48.480 --> 29:49.480]  We should be praying.
[29:49.480 --> 29:50.880]  We should be spreading the word.
[29:50.880 --> 29:58.080]  We should be demanding Trump won the office to expose this criminal activity.
[29:58.080 --> 30:16.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:16.080 --> 30:27.080]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[30:27.080 --> 30:51.480]  This is not a social contract where there's a neighborhood pool and everyone agrees not
[30:51.480 --> 30:53.040]  to take a dump in it.
[30:53.040 --> 30:56.360]  Because now there's a phenomenon where adults just crap in pools.
[30:56.360 --> 30:58.880]  People are so lazy and selfish.
[30:58.880 --> 31:01.960]  That's what decadence is.
[31:01.960 --> 31:06.360]  When your culture is being fastidious and having a really good social contract and really
[31:06.360 --> 31:11.760]  standing up for each other, then deviance becomes the thing.
[31:11.760 --> 31:12.960]  Like take Japan.
[31:12.960 --> 31:17.280]  You can leave your Rolex watch out at a restaurant, come back in an hour, it'll be sitting right
[31:17.280 --> 31:18.280]  there on the table.
[31:18.280 --> 31:23.680]  When they have earthquakes and tsunamis, the crime rate goes from almost nothing to zero.
[31:23.680 --> 31:29.040]  People don't take advantage when things are tough.
[31:29.040 --> 31:36.760]  But they have shops and things and degeneracies I don't even know existed because as the culture
[31:36.760 --> 31:43.600]  begins to break down, as the family breaks down, they are turning into bifurcated people
[31:43.600 --> 31:49.600]  where they have this evil side, this devilish side that is in the total degeneracy.
[31:49.600 --> 31:52.560]  And the left sells this argument, oh, you got to feed that side.
[31:52.560 --> 31:56.120]  No, you don't want to feed that side.
[31:56.120 --> 32:00.800]  You want to be conscious of that and realize what it is and that it's not part of your
[32:00.800 --> 32:06.840]  real system and that you have all these other destinies to be carried out that are going
[32:06.840 --> 32:09.480]  to take self-sacrifice.
[32:09.480 --> 32:15.120]  And it's because you're not sacrificing and you're not ascending that your body then starts
[32:15.120 --> 32:16.760]  to want to kill you.
[32:16.760 --> 32:22.000]  And you start to be depressed, you start to hate yourself because you're not being strong,
[32:22.000 --> 32:28.200]  you're not standing up, you're not doing what you're supposed to do.
[32:28.200 --> 32:33.600]  You know, plants don't grow in livery long and zero gravity, they just spin around in
[32:33.600 --> 32:34.600]  circles.
[32:34.600 --> 32:40.440]  If a plant doesn't get some wind on it, it never becomes strong.
[32:40.440 --> 32:48.680]  But they want to raise us inside these little greenhouses for the act of fully and completely
[32:48.680 --> 32:53.920]  conquering us forever, and there was just a horrible article, in fact, it's in the stack
[32:53.920 --> 33:00.800]  from there, you guys grabbed it for me, how China defeated the coronavirus and what they
[33:00.800 --> 33:01.800]  did right.
[33:01.800 --> 33:08.240]  And it's a big shot of a dome city in China where the party elites go and live outside
[33:08.240 --> 33:16.280]  of the smog and dead bodies and roaches and open sewers.
[33:16.280 --> 33:20.880]  And it's all about how you want to get into that dome city.
[33:20.880 --> 33:23.480]  They're the place that gave us COVID, but they're the dome city.
[33:23.480 --> 33:24.480]  They're the answer.
[33:24.480 --> 33:31.440]  See, it's an inversion of reality.
[33:31.440 --> 33:32.440]  You guys can't find it.
[33:32.440 --> 33:39.240]  We just put it in post here, I'll pull it up, it's on my phone.
[33:39.240 --> 33:43.320]  It's a New Yorker magazine article point is you'll see it everywhere.
[33:43.320 --> 33:50.040]  That's the same article over and over again, and Google and Apple and all these groups,
[33:50.040 --> 33:57.000]  it turned out for six, seven years are secretly buying up all the land in Denver, in Toronto,
[33:57.000 --> 34:05.280]  in Austin, and others areas, and also middle of nowhere, West Virginia to build domed cities.
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.160]  There it is.
[34:09.160 --> 34:18.080]  To build domed cities so that you can be safe from the COVID.
[34:18.080 --> 34:21.880]  Oh, you'll get inoculated, you'll get face scanned, you'll get checked.
[34:21.880 --> 34:27.200]  And then, of course, COVID will never make it into the city because they'll lie and say
[34:27.200 --> 34:29.920]  it never did because they can call it COVID if they want.
[34:29.920 --> 34:30.920]  They can not call it if they want.
[34:30.920 --> 34:35.120]  It's like New Zealand saying, oh, we haven't had one case in three months, oh, we had four
[34:35.120 --> 34:42.120]  cases, we're suspending the election and locking everything down.
[34:42.120 --> 34:46.960]  The whole end game is putting us into an artificial system.
[34:46.960 --> 34:57.560]  Why do you think the CIA funded seminal film of George Lucas, THX1138 was about?
[34:57.560 --> 35:03.760]  That was his student film that he then remade with Robert Duvall in his first major movie.
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.680]  He said, you have Robert Duvall in your movie and it's your living underground with the
[35:07.680 --> 35:13.560]  psychiatry tyranny over you and they're breaking up, they're ending the family and everyone's
[35:13.560 --> 35:18.200]  forced drugged, everybody has shaved heads, everybody wears the same uniforms.
[35:18.200 --> 35:20.040]  And why are they living underground?
[35:20.040 --> 35:25.800]  Well, you learn, Lucas didn't put it in the film, but in the postulate that, of course,
[35:25.800 --> 35:30.960]  he didn't come up with, there's been a bio weapon above ground.
[35:30.960 --> 35:38.280]  So this is a civilization a hundred years after it goes underground.
[35:38.280 --> 35:44.720]  And then you see it again in the movie, The Island, that came out in the early 2000s.
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.920]  And everyone thinks that, oh, they're lucky to live on the island because the bio weapon
[35:48.920 --> 35:51.920]  killed almost everybody on earth.
[35:51.920 --> 35:58.200]  But once a week, somebody wins the lottery to go from this island that's not very comfortable
[35:58.200 --> 36:02.320]  to this luxury island where they're repopulating the earth on this island where you can finally
[36:02.320 --> 36:03.880]  be outdoors again.
[36:03.880 --> 36:10.680]  And there's hundreds of these books, hundreds of these movies to pre-program you.
[36:10.680 --> 36:14.640]  Predictive programming is what it's called because even though it's scary when you sit
[36:14.640 --> 36:20.280]  there eating popcorn, eating a hot dog and drinking a big old large delicious Coca-Cola
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.520]  and you're watching clones getting grabbed and harvested and because they're really clones
[36:26.520 --> 36:30.280]  and you're watching all this tyranny, but you're sitting there eating a hot dog, your
[36:30.280 --> 36:39.720]  brain at the cellular synapse level associates it as non-threatening.
[36:39.720 --> 36:47.920]  It's like being raised and watching tigers eat zebras all day, but you eat pizza and
[36:47.920 --> 36:49.880]  drink Jack Daniels while you watch it.
[36:49.880 --> 36:54.680]  You'd think, hell, you'd associate tigers eating a gazelle or a zebra as good except
[36:54.680 --> 36:57.240]  it's going to eat you.
[36:57.240 --> 37:02.680]  So the slasher movies, the death, you're all desensitized so that when the real thing comes
[37:02.680 --> 37:09.600]  or your neighbor's being drug off, you don't say anything because it's just more entertainment.
[37:09.600 --> 37:11.360]  It's just more death.
[37:11.360 --> 37:12.920]  It's just more abortion.
[37:12.920 --> 37:15.160]  And so they tell you, yeah, we need to riot more.
[37:15.160 --> 37:16.720]  Yeah, white people are inherently evil.
[37:16.720 --> 37:19.160]  Yeah, we need to keep babies alive and harvest their organs.
[37:19.160 --> 37:21.880]  And there's a lot of money in that, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[37:21.880 --> 37:25.320]  The mother makes the decision whether the child has value.
[37:25.320 --> 37:26.320]  She says it doesn't.
[37:26.320 --> 37:36.160]  We are not resuscitating the babies alive, but the term is resuscitate to legal term
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.880]  in the bioethics board of the UN, you know, the death panels, but people get upset about
[37:41.880 --> 37:42.880]  that.
[37:42.880 --> 37:45.120]  That's Bill Gates.
[37:45.120 --> 37:53.280]  If we don't give that last year of healthcare to that older lady, who's a patient, we could
[37:53.280 --> 37:56.840]  hire 10 teachers, but that's a death panel.
[37:56.840 --> 38:02.560]  And so people don't like you when I say, hey, hey, hey, they people cloud like, I get some
[38:02.560 --> 38:03.560]  money.
[38:03.560 --> 38:04.760]  I get some money.
[38:04.760 --> 38:09.680]  Kill the granny.
[38:09.680 --> 38:12.280]  But we're not talking about an old lady deciding to not get cancer surgery.
[38:12.280 --> 38:13.660]  We're not talking about, no, no, no, no, no.
[38:13.660 --> 38:18.940]  training you that less is more. He's training you that we're not going to have an infrastructure
[38:18.940 --> 38:25.020]  anymore. You're not going to have police. You're not going to have doctors for you.
[38:25.020 --> 38:30.340]  That's for folks that have a high social credit score and are like rock stars that live in
[38:30.340 --> 38:34.900]  the new super cities that are so cool to be in the dumb cities. But of course, the real
[38:34.900 --> 38:40.020]  establishment is going to be out at armored compounds, you know, in northern Canada. That's
[38:40.020 --> 38:45.180]  really where they're going. They got some decoy facilities and stuff around the world,
[38:45.180 --> 38:51.700]  but they're up in Canada. They're being watched very closely. And none of them are going to
[38:51.700 --> 38:55.540]  escape. They're not going to escape. They're their controller that wants to kill everyone
[38:55.540 --> 39:02.060]  of them. And they're under the wings of just absolutely savage entity with just a vicious
[39:02.060 --> 39:07.820]  will that just the devil doesn't just want the planet. It hates us. We're a more advanced
[39:07.820 --> 39:13.160]  life form. We're just at an embryonic level. And he's looking at this larva going, that's
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.940]  fricking the, that's the big guy right there. He made these damn things. God, look how powerful
[39:18.940 --> 39:23.700]  they are. I can just get control of them. They'll build whatever I want. I'm going to tear them
[39:23.700 --> 39:30.020]  inside out before I flush them down the toilet because I'm going to beat this guy. That's
[39:30.020 --> 39:36.860]  Satan in a nutshell, folks. So God says, all right, have your way with my larva. Just make
[39:36.860 --> 39:44.020]  some tougher. I'm with the big guy. I'm with the plan. I'm on the program. I get it. I
[39:44.020 --> 39:49.500]  understand it. Time to join God, folks. Get off the planet. Go next level. Let's do it
[39:49.500 --> 39:55.940]  together. It's all a big test. Say no to Bill Gates. Say no to Satan. Nancy Pelosi, Eric
[39:55.940 --> 40:02.020]  Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and the list goes on from there have all gone on national
[40:02.020 --> 40:06.940]  TV, have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages of the New York Times, that
[40:06.940 --> 40:11.940]  they're wargaming, contesting the election when they lose. They know there's a landslide.
[40:11.940 --> 40:17.260]  If they're unable to steal it, they're planning to contest it and have Democrat blue states
[40:17.260 --> 40:22.740]  secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public Kamala
[40:22.740 --> 40:28.900]  Harris. This has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover
[40:28.900 --> 40:33.980]  to try to drive Trump from office. The Democratic Party, the chai comms, the deep state are
[40:33.980 --> 40:39.420]  using Black Lives Matter funded by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their
[40:39.420 --> 40:45.340]  attempts at creating artificial riots and martial law, that you're racist. When in truth, an
[40:45.340 --> 40:51.020]  old Nazi collaborator, George Soros, created Black Lives Matter along with Antifa. America's
[40:51.020 --> 40:56.660]  fighting for its life, but we will win. The social engineers bet on you not having a memory
[40:56.660 --> 41:01.220]  more than anything. They also bet, as they constantly talk about it in their own words,
[41:01.220 --> 41:06.260]  that you will adapt to being a slave, that you will learn incrementally to submit. So
[41:06.260 --> 41:11.580]  think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud. Remember that everything he said
[41:11.580 --> 41:16.060]  has been a premeditated lie. They lied about where it came from. They lied about person
[41:16.060 --> 41:21.380]  to person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate at 4% when it's
[41:21.380 --> 41:28.820]  actually 0.032 now and dropping. Then they set the test up to count almost all false
[41:28.820 --> 41:33.620]  positives. They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[41:33.620 --> 41:37.580]  They only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown. Now we're six months later. Now they say it's
[41:37.580 --> 41:41.620]  permanent. You got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're
[41:41.620 --> 41:45.060]  going to track everywhere you go and what you do. The global social credit score and
[41:45.060 --> 41:49.780]  the UN is the boss. Anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job.
[41:49.780 --> 41:54.260]  That's called 21st century tyranny. That's called world government takeover. The New
[41:54.260 --> 42:00.660]  World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government. But world government
[42:00.660 --> 42:07.100]  is only the control grid. Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to
[42:07.100 --> 42:12.620]  transcend and become gods and attain immortality. But the price for that is to carry out the
[42:12.620 --> 42:18.900]  orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms. That's why they say carbon is
[42:18.900 --> 42:25.380]  bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet. They are playing God.
[42:25.380 --> 42:32.140]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[42:32.140 --> 42:37.820]  to carry out this transformation. I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings
[42:37.820 --> 42:45.700]  of the globalist, it's all on record. You have been warned. You have been given the information
[42:45.700 --> 42:52.100]  to say no to this plan. This is the end of all life on earth as we know it. This is the
[42:52.100 --> 42:56.620]  alien takeover of earth. I'm going to say something right now. It is one of the most
[42:56.620 --> 43:02.380]  important things I've ever said, so please listen very, very carefully. Donald Trump
[43:02.380 --> 43:07.340]  is not the reason they released COVID or had the lockdown. They already had this plan,
[43:07.340 --> 43:13.900]  the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill of Melinda Gates. It is beyond critical. It is life and
[43:13.900 --> 43:17.060]  death for you and your family to understand. I'm not a real on the planet, but this is
[43:17.060 --> 43:24.780]  a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end. The United Nations
[43:24.780 --> 43:28.660]  has admitted that. First it's a month, then it's six months, then they say, okay, it's
[43:28.660 --> 43:34.980]  two years. They're now saying two years. They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[43:34.980 --> 43:39.860]  No more gatherings, no more anything, constant force inoculations that they admit don't
[43:39.860 --> 43:45.980]  even work. And the way they say they work, they change your DNA. This is the culling
[43:45.980 --> 43:50.500]  of the planet. This is the beginning of a straight jacket being put on you before you're
[43:50.500 --> 43:58.100]  slowly tortured to death and killed. You understand?
[43:58.100 --> 44:11.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:11.620 --> 44:22.900]  All right, welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us. Hopefully
[44:22.900 --> 44:27.420]  you spread the word. If you just tuned in, you're grabbed on the road, listened to some
[44:27.420 --> 44:32.380]  local radio station. Do you think what in the world is this I'm listening to? Listen,
[44:32.380 --> 44:38.500]  I wish it wasn't true. You can go research what I'm telling you. You can watch my film
[44:38.500 --> 44:43.780]  in game, blueprint for global enslavement. It's still on YouTube. They took it off Amazon
[44:43.780 --> 44:49.740]  because it had five stars and tens of thousands of downloads. They called it hate speech because
[44:49.740 --> 44:56.500]  it exposed the Nazi government where the Nazis came from, Planned Parenthood. And so, yes,
[44:56.500 --> 45:02.060]  literally a film that starts with the Nazis and goes through the history that came before
[45:02.060 --> 45:12.500]  it. That was removed for hate speech. Watch that film made 13 years ago. There's in game,
[45:12.500 --> 45:17.300]  blueprint for global enslavement. They want you dead. World government's just the beginning.
[45:17.300 --> 45:23.380]  The end game is you're dead. And I describe exactly the plan in their own writings, their
[45:23.380 --> 45:31.900]  own words and their own videos. So just remember that. And you'll watch it. You're like, wow,
[45:31.900 --> 45:37.540]  90% of this has come true. Yeah. And then you want the rest to come true? And I've said
[45:37.540 --> 45:43.700]  it a thousand times, I'll say it again. If I read the cheat sheet for college, say for
[45:43.700 --> 45:53.860]  Moby Dick, then I'm not surprised when AHAB goes down with the whale at the end. If I
[45:53.860 --> 46:00.580]  actually read the whole book, because I read the ending. So I know what they're going to
[46:00.580 --> 46:08.500]  do next because they've got a giant industrial, cultural, economic, spiritual, genetic plan.
[46:08.500 --> 46:12.660]  And I understand with Stockholm syndrome, people are like, I don't want to admit that.
[46:12.660 --> 46:17.460]  I want to go play golf. I want to go swimming. I want to go to the bar. I want to, hey, guess
[46:17.460 --> 46:21.300]  what? You're not going to do any of that soon. Worldwide depression, war on the streets,
[46:21.300 --> 46:31.500]  hell on earth. A dystopian fascist slash communist technocracy. China is the model just to begin
[46:31.500 --> 46:36.800]  with. And they're coming for one thing, your children, because they want to mold them into
[46:36.800 --> 46:47.980]  a nightmare and they want to tear them psychically, spiritually limb from limb slowly. They want
[46:47.980 --> 47:00.060]  to take the image of God and tear it apart. So I'll cover temporal little focused news
[47:00.060 --> 47:09.180]  next hour. Oh, let's look at this and let's look at that. But all of it is the fetid stinking,
[47:09.180 --> 47:20.540]  scruffulous covered droppings of Satanism. And Satanists love to have that pentagram
[47:20.540 --> 47:26.460]  on their chest. I think it gives them power. But all it is, is a man inverted. That's why
[47:26.460 --> 47:32.460]  they call movie stars. There's stars, the head, the arms, the legs, that's the star,
[47:32.460 --> 47:38.740]  the symbol, the pentacle is a positive symbol. It's why we have it on our flag represents
[47:38.740 --> 47:44.540]  we the people. Those are pictures of humans up there. Stars made the image of God to travel
[47:44.540 --> 47:51.060]  the stars of the stars from the stars with the stars and the blue of space and the blood
[47:51.060 --> 47:59.260]  that flows through our veins and the purity of God that holds our blood up. That's a holy
[47:59.260 --> 48:09.380]  symbol. It's why it's beautiful. It's why it's strong. Stars, this guy. But the devil
[48:09.380 --> 48:13.820]  works was oh, you're a star because you come to Hollywood and you bow down to us and we
[48:13.820 --> 48:21.660]  turn it upside down because it's so much fun to be upside down, driving man into the ground,
[48:21.660 --> 48:25.700]  destroying yourself, destroying your destiny, throwing it away, and throwing away other
[48:25.700 --> 48:33.900]  people's destinies. That's the most important part. And you look at these rebelling sacks
[48:33.900 --> 48:42.140]  of ugly garbage that do this. They have absolutely nothing and they slither around like they're
[48:42.140 --> 48:48.420]  doing important work and then they deceive people go oh, we don't really believe in Satan.
[48:48.420 --> 48:55.620]  We're just trying to mess with Christians, but we think the Democratic Party and liberals
[48:55.620 --> 49:05.580]  ought to be Satanists and that should be the new religion. Well, it ain't new. A religion
[49:05.580 --> 49:14.900]  of selfishness and destruction and death, the left hand path with your children and
[49:14.900 --> 49:28.380]  all of these fools coming out and making fun of the Christians. The real Satanists look
[49:28.380 --> 49:34.260]  like Bill Gates. They don't look like the scary guy with the lazy eye and the scar,
[49:34.260 --> 49:38.340]  or the guy that's got the club foot and he's mad at God because he's got it or the Harvey
[49:38.340 --> 49:44.780]  Weinstein that's mad because he's got a vagina. They're just mad at life. This guy's the Satanist.
[49:44.780 --> 49:51.020]  He wants to kill you and he wants to do it and gloat over you and laugh about it while
[49:51.020 --> 49:55.260]  he does it because he metaphysically has to get up there and say, wife's never coming
[49:55.260 --> 49:59.940]  back. You're going to be depressed forever. It's over. Don't have kids. Oh, the first
[49:59.940 --> 50:04.140]  world might be able to go out in a year and a half or so, but for the third world, he's
[50:04.140 --> 50:11.540]  telling you. He was on Chinese TV and Australian TV and a bunch of others, Japanese TV, over
[50:11.540 --> 50:15.220]  there had a different script. He was point blank. He said, they said, others, people,
[50:15.220 --> 50:19.060]  you say you're depopulating everybody. And he told them on all three channels, we're
[50:19.060 --> 50:24.980]  making a film about him. He said, there's different vaccines for different places.
[50:24.980 --> 50:30.060]  And the presenter goes, hmm, because we, we, we project on America. We're racist and we're
[50:30.060 --> 50:34.220]  bad. And no, no, we're the Christian place that tried to be Christian that tried to value
[50:34.220 --> 50:40.740]  everybody, the antithesis of this Satanism. You think in China and Japan and places that
[50:40.740 --> 50:44.780]  they don't think they're the elites and they don't hate each other and they don't hate
[50:44.780 --> 50:49.980]  foreigners and outsiders. The Japanese only respect us because we kicked their ass. And
[50:49.980 --> 50:53.500]  as soon as we did, they went, oh, you're the master. I'm not putting the Japanese down.
[50:53.500 --> 50:58.380]  I'm telling you the psychology Bill Gates gets up there and says, Hey, don't worry.
[50:58.380 --> 51:03.660]  I'm not going to kill you. And the, and the presenters are, Oh, thank you. Good. He goes,
[51:03.660 --> 51:09.620]  just, he goes, his answer. Are you trip depopulating? Well, there are different vaccines for different
[51:09.620 --> 51:14.660]  people. And he says, Oh, the third world's never getting out of lockdown because they're
[51:14.660 --> 51:18.300]  going to starve everybody to death. And you know, people go, well, Jones, you're against
[51:18.300 --> 51:22.460]  the hordes pouring over and all this, the UN also keeps them poor, dumb down and then
[51:22.460 --> 51:28.340]  uses them as a weapon. I'm not for 600 million people from Africa and all over the being
[51:28.340 --> 51:32.140]  brought here deliberately to not have any future jobs, drop the middle of everywhere
[51:32.140 --> 51:38.660]  to destroy us. The globalists use them as a weapon while they're busy killing them.
[51:38.660 --> 51:44.700]  That's what you do to your enemies. You throw them at each other and we sit here and we look
[51:44.700 --> 51:48.660]  at this and we watch this. Do you really think when they're done killing all those people
[51:48.660 --> 51:52.340]  in the third world, they're not going to kill you? Do you really think that? I mean, even
[51:52.340 --> 51:56.300]  if you want to kill the black people, I don't, even if they dumb them down and turn them
[51:56.300 --> 52:01.500]  against me and in all this other crap they've done to everybody, you think you're actually
[52:01.500 --> 52:05.700]  going to kill all these people and that you're not going to get killed yourself or that God
[52:05.700 --> 52:13.380]  isn't going to tear you apart. And so, yeah, and so they get the Africans to come over
[52:13.380 --> 52:16.700]  here and, you know, burn American flags, all this super crap, and they put that on the
[52:16.700 --> 52:22.660]  news to make you hate them. So you'll go along with killing them. Bill Gates is on TV and
[52:22.660 --> 52:27.700]  he says, you know, the economy's never open again. Yeah, a lot of people are going to
[52:27.700 --> 52:35.220]  get sick from the vaccine. See, he's not in the mode anymore of telling you lies. He's
[52:35.220 --> 52:43.140]  out in the open. He says, this is the way it is and we're going to do it. And then all
[52:43.140 --> 52:47.220]  these fools are going to go out and get these vaccines going, wink, wink, because I mean,
[52:47.220 --> 52:51.980]  the average Democrat mid-level knows Planned Parenthood is meant to kill blacks and they'll
[52:51.980 --> 52:55.020]  say, hey, man, there's two of these poor people. Are you going to take care of all these black
[52:55.020 --> 52:59.140]  people? And I'm like, well, I sure as hell ain't going to kill them. I mean, let's get
[52:59.140 --> 53:04.260]  down to brass tax here, man. There's a bunch of poor white people, too, that don't know
[53:04.260 --> 53:07.940]  what they're doing. Would you kill them? Let's just kill everybody. And then I got to sit
[53:07.940 --> 53:16.060]  there and watch the front people they've got, a bunch of weird Islamic women and fat, you
[53:16.060 --> 53:24.100]  know, black lesbians running every group on purpose to make us hate them. Ugly, surly,
[53:24.100 --> 53:30.500]  fat black lesbians force fed everywhere so that we hate black people. And so we hate
[53:30.500 --> 53:34.700]  black women that have had their men taken away and their culture destroyed. And we're
[53:34.700 --> 53:45.900]  being fed in right now at the same time. They elect horrible, nasty, evil satanic women
[53:45.900 --> 53:50.420]  and put one from an Islamic country we saved up with a bunch of commies over here, all up
[53:50.420 --> 53:55.660]  there with all those contradictions where they kill those women in their country for
[53:55.660 --> 54:00.580]  being lesbians, spewing how much they hate America, not saying a damn word about the
[54:00.580 --> 54:04.980]  NBA, not a damn word about China, a damn word about three million Muslims that aren't
[54:04.980 --> 54:09.700]  bad Muslims getting their asses tortured to death in China. It's all cutesy funny to
[54:09.700 --> 54:17.060]  these people because they put evil leaders in place on purpose to make people resonate
[54:17.060 --> 54:20.620]  with that because people are followers and believe that that's spirits leadership. And
[54:20.620 --> 54:24.100]  it's because we aren't challenging them in the third dimension at all their events,
[54:24.100 --> 54:28.980]  everywhere else with the truth, they've taken control. Well, I refuse to sit here and not
[54:28.980 --> 54:34.980]  lead the assault. I don't want to be your leader. I want you to be a leader now. We
[54:34.980 --> 54:40.300]  don't have time. It's time to start leading from the front with action. We'll be right
[54:40.300 --> 54:44.140]  back with our number two. Stay with us.
[54:44.140 --> 54:49.620]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[54:49.620 --> 54:53.780]  to be charged for the attempted murder. They don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery
[54:53.780 --> 54:58.780]  and they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry liberal academics
[54:58.780 --> 55:03.060]  and others. And now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, Hey, Trump's going
[55:03.060 --> 55:06.900]  to try to steal the election and contest it. But then their internal wargaming documents
[55:06.900 --> 55:12.180]  come out with John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and of course Joe Biden.
[55:12.180 --> 55:16.020]  And they're saying, Oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have the Democrat
[55:16.020 --> 55:20.860]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote. And we are then going to
[55:20.860 --> 55:25.340]  set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump. This is officially in the
[55:25.340 --> 55:28.780]  New York Times. I don't just believe the New York Times. I've been telling you for over
[55:28.780 --> 55:33.220]  a year, this is their plan from other statements they've made. And then Atlantic Monthly, The
[55:33.220 --> 55:37.420]  Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the Council on Farm Relations. This is their
[55:37.420 --> 55:41.860]  plan. We've got 80 days left to stop it. What are you going to do? I'm serious, folks. This
[55:41.860 --> 56:01.740]  is the time to save the country. The answer to 1984 is 1776. Info wars has been banned,
[56:01.740 --> 56:15.980]  arrested, attacked and threatened. Because we are effective. The great awakening is here.
[56:15.980 --> 56:29.740]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share. Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[56:29.740 --> 56:58.740]  and never give up the fight. Info wars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:58.740 --> 57:18.860]  All right. This video is making its grounds on YouTube. It's just one of many. Where
[57:18.860 --> 57:24.500]  I lay out how they're going to get control and have the global lockdown. And how they're
[57:24.500 --> 57:29.220]  going to get us to accept through coercion the inoculations but legally won't make you
[57:29.220 --> 57:36.140]  do it. Because metaphysically, that breaks a rule. That's why they want to have children
[57:36.140 --> 57:40.140]  have the age of consent for medical stuff, sex, you name it, like six. They also want
[57:40.140 --> 57:46.020]  us to have laws because God looks at laws that we pass. And when we pass evil laws,
[57:46.020 --> 57:50.580]  we get really judged when it's official. They like to put the Satanism in writing and burn
[57:50.580 --> 57:56.380]  it into granite. And then I just got some good Millie Weaver news. I didn't want to
[57:56.380 --> 58:03.700]  get into it until I learned what was happening with her court case in Ohio outside of Akron.
[58:03.700 --> 58:07.660]  So I've got some good news that I'll tell you about coming up. Start of the next segment.
[58:07.660 --> 58:15.700]  You know, I've really tried to give you guys accurate information. And the reason I was
[58:15.700 --> 58:20.980]  flummoxed when this happened is it was like being hit by a truck. He didn't know was coming.
[58:20.980 --> 58:26.700]  It was just bizarre. Couldn't figure it out. And I figured out what's going on now. And
[58:26.700 --> 58:35.580]  gives me a headache. But it's just a crazy climate that's going on in this country. And
[58:35.580 --> 58:41.580]  how crazy things have gotten. But they were arrested for something that was petty and
[58:41.580 --> 58:46.340]  her mother said wasn't a big deal. A scuffle on a phone getting broken three months ago,
[58:46.340 --> 58:53.380]  four months ago. And then because she's a reporter that does work for us, they did go
[58:53.380 --> 58:56.420]  with pretty much a restaurant for the book editor to have that headline in full wars
[58:56.420 --> 59:02.300]  contributor. But in a way, God works has made the film get bigger. Lord works through mysterious
[59:02.300 --> 59:05.460]  ways and a weapon form against the prosper. But I'll give you the tales of that coming
[59:05.460 --> 59:11.180]  up. Here's part of this report. Alex Jones warns us about COVID 19 years ahead. Here
[59:11.180 --> 59:16.980]  it is. Well, I've always said about the Ebola outbreak that I believe the first big plagues
[59:16.980 --> 59:23.980]  the 21st century cell phone brain tumors that'll be covered up all the neurological disorders
[59:23.980 --> 59:29.860]  from vaccines that'll be covered up as a practice of how they manage covering things up as it
[59:29.860 --> 59:33.780]  actually reduces the population. But then they'll have big events with Ebola or mouse
[59:33.780 --> 59:38.380]  pox I've predicted. Now we're seeing Ebola that'll wipe out hundreds of thousands, then
[59:38.380 --> 59:44.980]  millions, then they'll put in a medical tyranny with forced inoculations around stopping that
[59:44.980 --> 59:49.900]  to actually weaken us and get us ready to release a pathogen that only kills those of
[59:49.900 --> 59:56.300]  us that already had the binary GMOs or vaccines in us. So the one the other part is introduced
[59:56.300 --> 1:00:00.500]  a binary weapon is where it needs two or more things to activate. And that's the only weapon
[1:00:00.500 --> 1:00:04.500]  they'll deploy against us is something they've already tested. They've already mutated. They
[1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:09.340]  already know the chain of mutations is going to go through so that it will have an computer
[1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:15.180]  modeled effect so they can be ready. And again, the average person involved will know nothing.
[1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:21.580]  It'll be modeled and managed to test some subplagues that only kill 5 million, 10 million, 20 million
[1:00:21.580 --> 1:00:28.100]  ahead of a mega weapon that'll then later be released that'll kill 90% of the population.
[1:00:28.100 --> 1:00:32.300]  And that's what the globalists and all their publications say is 90% what they're going
[1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:38.620]  to whack. When you get deeper into their documents, they go, well, really humans are a disease.
[1:00:38.620 --> 1:00:43.300]  Only a few elite will be allowed to live will merge with machines and be God. And you can't
[1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:47.660]  have too many gods. So in a lot of their documents, if you read deeper, they even talk about there
[1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:54.460]  being one being that comes out of the survival of the fittest social Darwin mega race. And
[1:00:54.460 --> 1:01:00.780]  so there can be only one God kind of comes down to that. And that's the point we've now
[1:01:00.780 --> 1:01:06.020]  reached. Now, whether this is all real or theoretical, the point is the elite are open
[1:01:06.020 --> 1:01:12.660]  about their religion. This is their holy grail. This is their brass ring. This is their goal.
[1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:18.220]  This is their promise land. This is this is what they want to do. And so anyone that ignores
[1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:25.300]  this does so at insane levels of peril. Because once you know their master plan, then everything
[1:01:25.300 --> 1:01:30.740]  makes sense. And no matter how bad the tragedies are, how many they kill, we're just unconscious.
[1:01:30.740 --> 1:01:35.740]  We're just animals. We're just a plague hurting the earth. They're the guardians of the galaxy.
[1:01:35.740 --> 1:01:40.340]  They're the guardians of the earth. And they know best in the end. And they are going to
[1:01:40.340 --> 1:01:46.820]  attain this Godhood. They are going to achieve Elysium. And then once they've achieved Elysium,
[1:01:46.820 --> 1:01:54.620]  the golden fields of the demigod, they will then take the fire United Nations and the
[1:01:54.620 --> 1:02:01.780]  National Institutes of Health with the CDC are publicly conducting a 4,000 person study
[1:02:01.780 --> 1:02:07.980]  spending tens of millions of dollars at Yale on 15 ways to brainwash the public into taking
[1:02:07.980 --> 1:02:13.020]  inoculations, basically squeezing you and forcing you to take them through guilt, through
[1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:17.980]  fines, through not being able to go into stores, not be able to go on airplanes or have jobs.
[1:02:17.980 --> 1:02:23.860]  This is forced inoculations. It's public Gateway pundit wrote about it last week. David Knight
[1:02:23.860 --> 1:02:28.620]  wrote about it this week. Stories up on info wars.com. So people say, oh, I'll just wear
[1:02:28.620 --> 1:02:35.140]  a mask. It's never going to end. That's just the sign of submission. Fauci admits that
[1:02:35.140 --> 1:02:40.220]  next is the contact tracing of the apps on your phones and the inoculations that is
[1:02:40.220 --> 1:02:46.140]  a DNA vaccine that changes your DNA. This isn't a science fiction movie. It's happening
[1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:56.140]  right now. Compliance is death. Compliance is annihilation. Wake up. Wake up.
[1:02:56.140 --> 1:03:03.140]  Live Raw and Unfiltered by Globalist Propaganda. It's Alex Jones.
[1:03:03.140 --> 1:03:23.820]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up in this hour. I'm going to cover the news.
[1:03:23.820 --> 1:03:28.780]  There are videos coming out. So many of them. They're on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[1:03:28.780 --> 1:03:33.340]  When I go to Paul Joseph, watch his Twitter or I go to Mike Cernovich's Twitter or I go
[1:03:33.340 --> 1:03:43.260]  to Andy Nose Twitter or any of those. I mean, you can watch it for hours. White people being
[1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:49.820]  drug out of their vehicles and beating up shot and killed. Mainly by white people showing
[1:03:49.820 --> 1:03:56.260]  off in front of black people. And I'm not defending black people doing this. I'm just,
[1:03:56.260 --> 1:04:06.140]  it's crazy. And literally trying to jump in front of people's trucks and they beat up
[1:04:06.140 --> 1:04:14.260]  the guy's wife and then they act like they're helping her. I mean, I laugh not because it's
[1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:22.140]  funny. I laugh because I don't want the trouble if I come up to some checkpoint and they start
[1:04:22.140 --> 1:04:24.940]  beating my vehicle and trying to pull me out of it. But I mean, if you got a weapon,
[1:04:24.940 --> 1:04:30.860]  you're doing that, I'm going to defend myself. And these evil people have no chivalry, no
[1:04:30.860 --> 1:04:37.780]  decency. And look, that's a man attacking a middle-aged woman who's crying and begging
[1:04:37.780 --> 1:04:46.060]  for help from behind, begging, trying to get in the car with her husband. He runs in fear
[1:04:46.060 --> 1:04:53.540]  and the media is calling this the new Charlottesville. And I said they corralled those cars in there
[1:04:53.540 --> 1:04:57.740]  to cause Charlottesville and probably made that guy run over that poor lady that died
[1:04:57.740 --> 1:05:01.860]  and they sued me for that. Because I said Soros was fun and the whole thing, trying
[1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:10.980]  to create a clash. The University of Georgetown, the Vatican, is trying to put us out of business.
[1:05:10.980 --> 1:05:16.820]  I only say that so you realize the level we're at. You know, Roger Stone could have snapped
[1:05:16.820 --> 1:05:21.900]  his fingers and been paid any amount of money to make up stuff about President Trump, but
[1:05:21.900 --> 1:05:28.740]  he was honorable and didn't. And then you never see the enemy stop trying to get Roger.
[1:05:28.740 --> 1:05:33.020]  They are so angry at him for getting Trump to run and advising Trump, getting me on
[1:05:33.020 --> 1:05:42.220]  board with Trump. And boy, Roger Stone is really a Christian now. He was brought up
[1:05:42.220 --> 1:05:52.220]  a Christian. What is it? I think it's like Eastern European and Sicilian parents, but
[1:05:52.220 --> 1:05:59.860]  hungry or something. The point is, is that Roger called me up now and starts praying
[1:05:59.860 --> 1:06:03.580]  with me on the phone. And he's not a fake guy when it comes to people calling people
[1:06:03.580 --> 1:06:11.100]  up at home. That's good. He's got Holy Ghost fire now. They're really pissed. So a lot
[1:06:11.100 --> 1:06:22.140]  of stuff is going on. But I spent the whole first hour on Bill Gates and reading the latest
[1:06:22.140 --> 1:06:30.780]  interviews he's given. It's bad, man. Wow. It's exactly what we knew they'd do. They're
[1:06:30.780 --> 1:06:35.460]  never ending this lockdown, folks. And it's going to cause, it already has caused a depression.
[1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:39.380]  And it's going to get so bad and you're being taught that you're obsolete, that you are
[1:06:39.380 --> 1:06:44.580]  non-essential. And it's their whole plan unfolding exactly as they said they'd do it. And so
[1:06:44.580 --> 1:06:50.340]  I know what comes next. And that's why they want us all fair. So let me do this in a second
[1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:57.740]  and I'll give you the middle of your update. Next segment, then I'll get it all the other
[1:06:57.740 --> 1:07:06.100]  news. And the mass exodus away from both the east and west coast. But I do need to do this
[1:07:06.100 --> 1:07:14.700]  because I didn't do this last hour. I have three new specials and I've been so busy that
[1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:22.100]  I never cut them, never cut ads for them. And I get so fatalistic about how bad things
[1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:26.660]  have gotten that I kind of buy into their propaganda and stop even worrying about this
[1:07:26.660 --> 1:07:29.780]  place being here in the future. When it's more important than ever that we stay here
[1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:35.780]  and we be here. So they came to me a few weeks ago and they said, listen, you are doing specials
[1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:40.580]  that are too big and you're doing free shipping and all this. And it's bringing in a bunch
[1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:49.020]  of money, but not a lot of extra funds. The fun things. And so I just said to the guys,
[1:07:49.020 --> 1:07:52.500]  I said, well, I've habituated everybody to, you know, want to have these super great deals
[1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:58.340]  and we don't put enough markup in it that when we do this big a discount, it brings
[1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:03.580]  in enough money. So I'm not bitching. I'm not complaining. I'm just saying these are
[1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:08.260]  really important products. These are really great products, the water filtration, the
[1:08:08.260 --> 1:08:13.900]  air filtration, the storeable food, all of it you need, the books, the DVDs, the films,
[1:08:13.900 --> 1:08:17.940]  all the gear on the site is really first rate. We put bumper stickers on the orders. And
[1:08:17.940 --> 1:08:24.260]  so all I'm saying is, you know, don't give your money to Jeff Bezos and do your shopping
[1:08:24.260 --> 1:08:30.820]  there. Do it with us and actually get things that are really great. Fish oil has been sold
[1:08:30.820 --> 1:08:35.420]  out for months. It's back in stock. It's the highest grade fish oil we can get. And the
[1:08:35.420 --> 1:08:41.380]  process of having any mercury in it removed, that is extremely expensive. It costs, I mean,
[1:08:41.380 --> 1:08:46.940]  we buy the top of the line fish oil that they sell in medical clinics. It's not prescription,
[1:08:46.940 --> 1:08:49.740]  but people aren't going to, you know, people aren't going to pay a hundred dollars at the
[1:08:49.740 --> 1:08:54.820]  store for a super high quality fish oil that they're trying to turn into a drug. It's so
[1:08:54.820 --> 1:08:58.780]  effective or it does for your body, your heart, your brain, everything else. Well, we don't
[1:08:58.780 --> 1:09:03.780]  put the five times markup or the four times markup like the, like the doctor's office
[1:09:03.780 --> 1:09:09.300]  does, you know, that sells the vitamins and the high end minerals. We do a 200% markup
[1:09:09.300 --> 1:09:12.060]  and then everybody wants to discount, then discount it, you know, and make a hundred
[1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:17.260]  percent. But then with free shipping, it's less than that. And on some of these, it's
[1:09:17.260 --> 1:09:22.500]  a bigger deal than that. So these are really high end, high quality. I mean, I just thought
[1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:29.460]  people want super high quality, high end at a price that is what mid grade vitamins and
[1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:32.900]  minerals are because you do get what you pay for. I mean, you go take that stuff, they
[1:09:32.900 --> 1:09:36.260]  sell multivitamins for 10 bucks at the store that says it's all the vitamins and minerals.
[1:09:36.260 --> 1:09:41.180]  And if you read, it's synthetic. And that's how they have studies outlawing vitamins cause
[1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:45.340]  people to have heart attacks and liver failure. Well, yeah, because they're not vitamins,
[1:09:45.340 --> 1:09:50.140]  but they have approval by the FDA and the government to put it out when it's a synthetic
[1:09:50.140 --> 1:10:00.980]  vitamin. That's crazy. Our vitamins are not synthetic. So eight pack power stack, I thought
[1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:09.020]  would be the best seller ever. It costs us all said and done like $30 a box for these
[1:10:09.020 --> 1:10:15.940]  13 pills a day. You won't forget it. It changes people's lives. It's amazing. We're not going
[1:10:15.940 --> 1:10:20.500]  to reproduce this when it sells out in just the next month or so, two months because it's
[1:10:20.500 --> 1:10:24.780]  so expensive and it's such an investment. And I had to totally discount it almost to
[1:10:24.780 --> 1:10:33.100]  cost to move it. Now everybody's buying it, but I just can't. Okay, it's gone. Eight pack
[1:10:33.100 --> 1:10:39.340]  power stack and survival shield X two combo X two is now back in stock, the original liquid,
[1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:46.540]  not the spray bottle. It's back into 60% off hard and body combo extend to wise. It's amazing

[1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:31.820]  health because it's just a fact. I mean, medical doctors tell you what do you think it does for

[1:11:44.940 --> 1:11:51.260]  but it gives you stinky burps because here's the deal. It's not pasteurized. You they take fish,
[1:11:51.260 --> 1:11:55.540]  boil them down, render them down krill. It's a bunch of crap. It still has a great effect,
[1:11:55.540 --> 1:12:02.340]  but it's all cloudy. It's not red and grid krills red folks. And if you take fish oil and it doesn't
[1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:05.700]  give you the burps, it's not good. You take krill oil, it doesn't give you a fish taste,
[1:12:05.700 --> 1:12:10.140]  which I don't like, but it I sleep better. I feel better. I'm always forgetting to take it.
[1:12:10.140 --> 1:12:15.100]  When I take it, my life's so much better. It's good for adults. It's good for children. Krill oil

[1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:33.300]  year. He dumps them on us in his business plan with his board or wherever so that they order more.

[1:12:47.340 --> 1:12:52.140]  So we did add that on there. Well, they're right back. Stay with us. Attention, attention, attention
[1:12:52.140 --> 1:12:58.020]  to anyone that still wants to live in a free country. The new world order shy com globalist
[1:12:58.020 --> 1:13:03.260]  syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and thrust the United States into a civil
[1:13:03.260 --> 1:13:08.740]  war by contesting the election. They are openly working in this at the highest levels of democratic
[1:13:08.740 --> 1:13:13.500]  party. Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election.
[1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:19.500]  Trump is going. They will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that
[1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:24.380]  anyone challenging that will be called a racist. They will then trigger race riots and violence.
[1:13:24.380 --> 1:13:30.420]  They've already beta tested around the country. We are not living in normal times when these
[1:13:30.420 --> 1:13:34.140]  type of things happen in history. People are usually caught flat footed because they can't
[1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:39.780]  believe that they're living in such a criminal era. We are. We are living in the period where
[1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:45.100]  this criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on America is being exposed and removed. Now is
[1:13:45.100 --> 1:13:49.140]  the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country. Spread the word now,
[1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:57.260]  Paul Revere's. How do you contest an election in the year 2020? Well, you trigger race riots and
[1:13:57.260 --> 1:14:02.300]  you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're the speaker of the house that you are
[1:14:02.300 --> 1:14:07.700]  legitimately now the president. That's what she's been said on CBS News and that you're going to
[1:14:07.700 --> 1:14:13.460]  have those blue states succeed. Yes, that's officially called a civil war. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:14:13.460 --> 1:14:18.180]  the Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood, the chai comms and the whole globalist system. This
[1:14:18.180 --> 1:14:23.460]  is treason with a capital T and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards. They
[1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:27.940]  won't even stand up against it and do anything even though our president has been exposing it.
[1:14:27.940 --> 1:14:32.540]  But here's the bottom line. You need storeable food. We've got the best quality ready to ship to

[1:15:17.940 --> 1:15:24.740]  on this August 17, 2020 Monday transmission 77 days out from the election. I tend to open the
[1:15:24.740 --> 1:15:29.020]  phones up in the third hour ahead of Gerald Salente in the fourth hour in the war room with
[1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:37.580]  the vaunted Owen Shroyer. All right. Let's get into the Millie Weaver situation. I don't take
[1:15:37.580 --> 1:15:43.940]  advantage of events that take place for an agenda I have. I just go with what I really believe the
[1:15:43.940 --> 1:15:51.060]  truth is. And I got blindsided on Friday because Millie had said she was ready to come up with a
[1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:56.860]  film that Saturday and I understand films get behind. That's great. She's made a lot of documentaries.
[1:15:56.860 --> 1:16:00.420]  I'm I was sure it was gonna be interesting. We've been promoting it here on air, running trailers
[1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:05.740]  for it. I hadn't seen it. And she said I need more time. I said, take weeks if you need it. I said,
[1:16:05.740 --> 1:16:12.300]  it's not my film. I mean, I fund you guys, but your your freelance. And I didn't really know
[1:16:12.300 --> 1:16:17.860]  everybody in their film. But I had one lady that's in the film on my election fraud in Kentucky
[1:16:17.860 --> 1:16:21.860]  that really got on. She seemed, you know, in informative and interesting and well spoken.
[1:16:21.860 --> 1:16:25.820]  And there was clearly fraud in Kentucky. So this is great. People in this film haven't seen it.
[1:16:25.820 --> 1:16:33.540]  And then I'm coming into the show. Well, let's go back. Millie starts calling me saying, Hey,
[1:16:33.540 --> 1:16:41.700]  this Patrick Berge guy that's in the film, he's in Austin. And I said, Okay, well, I'll have him
[1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:45.260]  on. Let me know when the film is ready. Let me see the film. So don't talk about her. Send me
[1:16:45.260 --> 1:16:51.540]  some clips of the film. And then we'll set you up and he can be in studio. Well, nothing happens
[1:16:51.540 --> 1:16:56.300]  on that Wednesday, Thursday. And then she calls me in the morning. I'm working out. I don't answer.
[1:16:56.300 --> 1:17:03.580]  But she's saying, Hey, Patrick Berge's in town, you ought to get him on. And I called Daria up,
[1:17:03.580 --> 1:17:07.580]  the producer and I say, Hey, you know, see what's going on with us. Is she ready with the film?
[1:17:07.580 --> 1:17:12.580]  Can I see it? When's it coming out? We don't know. I come in to do the show a couple hours later.
[1:17:12.580 --> 1:17:18.140]  And they come in right for the show. And they go, Millie Weaver's been arrested. We're getting
[1:17:18.140 --> 1:17:22.660]  the video. I go, arrested. What the hell? You know, Ohio. Yeah, it's been SWAT team. That's what
[1:17:22.660 --> 1:17:25.780]  the internet was saying. So I go in there and say, Oh, she's been SWAT teams. I haven't seen the
[1:17:25.780 --> 1:17:29.180]  footage yet. It wasn't SWAT team. They came, you know, and then it looked fake because the cops
[1:17:29.180 --> 1:17:34.380]  are like, Oh, you Gavin Wentz, your husband wants you to know, we're not going to give it to you.
[1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:39.980]  And I'm like, okay. Then the internet starts saying, I faked this for this film. I've never seen the
[1:17:39.980 --> 1:17:46.140]  film. I don't make money off the film. It's free. Millie does her own thing. I don't, I'm not distancing
[1:17:46.140 --> 1:17:51.820]  myself from the film. I don't know what's in it. I don't, I'm just nice promoting it, trusting my,
[1:17:51.820 --> 1:17:56.140]  you know, correspondence. And boy has Millie done a lot of great work over the years. She's been
[1:17:56.140 --> 1:18:02.780]  doing stuff with us for over eight years. And so I'm on air and they go, Hey, the guy's at the door
[1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:08.620]  here. So I will talk to him and he's, he's looking kind of freaked out talking to me like,
[1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:13.340]  he's like info wars. That's where I come from. That's there. I'm like, well, who do you think
[1:18:13.340 --> 1:18:16.780]  runs it? Who's the charge? Well, I think Roger Stone is this is off air in here with me. And I'm
[1:18:16.780 --> 1:18:22.300]  like, I'm like, dude, Roger Stone can't figure out how to work as cell phone or Skype. Are you joking?
[1:18:22.300 --> 1:18:27.980]  I mean, he's a smart political guy. He helped Trump get the black vote. But I mean, that's what we
[1:18:27.980 --> 1:18:33.020]  did. Something we really did help deliver was the truth about Trump and decriminalization of
[1:18:33.020 --> 1:18:38.620]  marijuana and minimum sentencing and stuff. And so I think this is people in over their head. It
[1:18:38.620 --> 1:18:44.700]  is what I think because he was in here and I'm like, dude, Roger Stone's not involved in your
[1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:49.660]  shadow net deal. Come on with general Jones. There's no proof of that. No evidence. They just say that.
[1:18:49.660 --> 1:18:53.900]  They just say it. And I kind of got off on a rabbit trail. I don't care if they got something
[1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:57.740]  wrong in the film. I've seen it now. There is government propaganda going on. This is part of
[1:18:57.740 --> 1:19:01.900]  that. It's a good report. I like the film. It's gotten a lot of publicity, a couple million views
[1:19:01.900 --> 1:19:08.860]  on YouTube for got taken down, which is wrong. We have it at band video posted. So then that guy
[1:19:08.860 --> 1:19:12.620]  leaves and I don't know the next day he comes out and says all the stuff about me that I'm bad,
[1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:15.500]  that I'm like, you know, because I was saying, well, maybe they got her because there's something
[1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:18.700]  secret in the film because I was thinking they came and got like everybody else because the film,
[1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:24.700]  then I talked to the family and others and find out it was nothing or their mom fight over a cell
[1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:29.580]  phone, a cheap cell phone at that that broke. She filed a report about it because she left
[1:19:29.580 --> 1:19:33.500]  California to come there during the COVID lockdown. And people get arguments with their
[1:19:33.500 --> 1:19:36.540]  parents. I mean, I got a good relationship with my parents. I still get arguments with them sometimes.
[1:19:36.540 --> 1:19:41.900]  Tell them I live with them at this age. We probably have more than words. It's just, you know,
[1:19:41.900 --> 1:19:46.940]  you don't live with your parents. Things go sideways. And that's when you're old and got kids.
[1:19:47.980 --> 1:19:51.740]  And so I found out the whole story that it was just a little bit of an argument. A phone got
[1:19:51.740 --> 1:19:58.060]  broken. She filed a report. So clearly they came out there because it's info wars. And they wanted
[1:19:58.060 --> 1:20:03.740]  to say because they're Democrats info wars correspondent, domestic violence, burglary,
[1:20:03.740 --> 1:20:08.620]  and all this stuff. And it's overblown and it's a fraud. I don't think it was to stop the film
[1:20:08.620 --> 1:20:12.860]  because it didn't stop the film. And the film was supposed to be out five, six, seven days before.
[1:20:13.420 --> 1:20:17.980]  I mean, if they did that, boy, the deep state did a perfect job to then go hype something up.
[1:20:17.980 --> 1:20:22.780]  That's why people thought I must have hyped something up or that I must have masterminded
[1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:26.060]  this because why would you have the cops right there when they're supposedly just going to
[1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:29.980]  release a film? I don't know when they were going to release the film. But what really got to me was
[1:20:31.500 --> 1:20:36.300]  how the guys here in town waiting to come on my show and then I'm never sent the film.
[1:20:37.260 --> 1:20:41.100]  And I'm told, Oh, technical problems will get a copy to you, whatever. I usually watch something
[1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:47.260]  before I talk about it, especially if I financed it. And then to find out Rogers implicated as a
[1:20:47.260 --> 1:20:52.300]  kingpin in it with no evidence, that kind of hurts, you know. So that's more evidence of how
[1:20:52.300 --> 1:20:59.900]  I'm an insider and I'm bad. Roger Stone secretly works for Obama or whatever. So I'm not mad at
[1:20:59.900 --> 1:21:04.940]  that guy. I'm not mad at the Tory lady, any of these people. The internet can go research these
[1:21:04.940 --> 1:21:09.900]  folks themselves, figure out what they think about the whole deal. That's why I'm hands off with
[1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:15.900]  Paul Watson or Millie Weaver or Caitlin Bennett. You can ask any of these people. Very little
[1:21:15.900 --> 1:21:19.980]  feedback. As long as they're putting good material out and fight the new world order, I just support
[1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:24.780]  them. And they say info words is our sponsor. And we get great content to fight the new world order.
[1:21:24.780 --> 1:21:30.220]  I'm the opposite of the deep state, totally hands off, not hands on until a point I get with people,
[1:21:30.220 --> 1:21:35.660]  things get a little too weird. Then I just decouple. But the good news is, and I can tell you this
[1:21:35.660 --> 1:21:41.420]  now is I just talked to the folks that are there with her in Ohio. And they are there at the
[1:21:41.420 --> 1:21:45.500]  courthouse and the CPS is not taking the kids right now. They're still going to be investigating
[1:21:45.500 --> 1:21:51.740]  them. And they have some good lawyers, thanks to listeners out there and your support. And
[1:21:53.100 --> 1:21:58.300]  they are going to be released anytime now. And so that's certainly good news. But what happens
[1:21:58.300 --> 1:22:03.900]  when information warfare is so big and fighting the globalist is so big. High school stuff kind
[1:22:03.900 --> 1:22:08.940]  of breaks out with films and filmmakers and people that are in films. It's like Hollywood drama.
[1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:13.100]  And that's not what we do. We're not drama. It's why I don't even sell films anymore.
[1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:17.580]  I just finance a lot of other people's documentaries. I just support people
[1:22:17.580 --> 1:22:23.340]  with cold hard cash that you send to us buying products. And I just pump it out to as many
[1:22:23.340 --> 1:22:28.940]  people as I can. And I try to do as much as I can. You know, I've financed a lot of the big films
[1:22:28.940 --> 1:22:34.540]  exposing the child kidnapping rings. And you finance that. And a lot of people that I've
[1:22:34.540 --> 1:22:37.260]  just asked, I don't want credit. Like I told people, I said, you don't need to put me in the
[1:22:37.260 --> 1:22:42.780]  credits. It's not about that. And I'm not like George Sorrell. I don't have that much money.
[1:22:42.780 --> 1:22:49.420]  But 50,000 here, 100,000 here, 20,000 there, 10,000 here, you know, that really does the
[1:22:49.420 --> 1:22:53.740]  trick for people that are living legitimate work. But I've noticed stay completely out of their
[1:22:53.740 --> 1:23:01.260]  process. Stay completely out of it because people becoming famous and people interfacing and people
[1:23:01.260 --> 1:23:06.620]  being leaders is hard. And the globalists come in and they try to sabotage and they try to do
[1:23:06.620 --> 1:23:09.580]  all this stuff. You know, it's like, I want to embrace the Q people and believe it's all real
[1:23:09.580 --> 1:23:13.420]  and good folks. But they're like, Jones, you, you're going to get it for the child kidnapping
[1:23:13.420 --> 1:23:18.140]  rings. We pioneered exposing it. Or yeah, you ought to support Millie Moria. Turn your back on her.
[1:23:18.140 --> 1:23:22.060]  Yeah, I bought him an RV, find him $100 plus thousand dollars a year. I missed a horrible person.
[1:23:22.620 --> 1:23:27.020]  And then it's just some guy never met in my office in an outfit with a 45 jacket on one.
[1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:32.940]  He leaves that guy as a new world order. I'm the good guy. I'm the good person. I expose the
[1:23:32.940 --> 1:23:38.220]  rider's stone. It's just like, or it's worse. I don't know. So that's the Millie we were saying.
[1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:42.860]  And I don't know how long this relationship is going to continue. All right, we'll be right back.
[1:23:42.860 --> 1:23:55.900]  Stay with us. You can really break civilizations down to two types, predatory and non predatory
[1:23:55.900 --> 1:24:01.900]  or oppressive conquest based or Renaissance based. And of course, different types of civilizations and
[1:24:01.900 --> 1:24:08.700]  countries and political systems of history and the present are mixes of the two. But with
[1:24:08.700 --> 1:24:17.020]  globalism, it is a post human ideology. So it's scientifically geared to be oppressive.
[1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:22.940]  And the rationale is social Darwinism that the ruling class are elites. And because they're
[1:24:22.940 --> 1:24:29.260]  in power, they have a right to rule over you, poison you, dumb you down, sterilize you and kill
[1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:35.420]  you. So all the people wearing masks like outside at the park and stuff are living in a total hoax
[1:24:35.420 --> 1:24:40.940]  and think their active submission is an active working for the common good in a collective.
[1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:45.820]  No, it's a sign that you're a slave who will take the force inoculations. Federal government
[1:24:45.820 --> 1:24:52.140]  Yale are studying the force inoculations right now. Incrementalism, the inchworm effect,
[1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:57.500]  successive approximation. First, they tell you only stay in your house for 15 days,
[1:24:57.500 --> 1:25:02.220]  so the hospitals can stay empty. That was all a fraud. Then wear a mask for a month.
[1:25:02.220 --> 1:25:07.980]  Here we are six months later. Then they start making people at colleges and at big corporations
[1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:14.140]  where wristbands showing that they've been quote, contact traced and tested for COVID.
[1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:19.420]  Then comes the apps on your phones and the global social credit score now being rolled out by
[1:25:19.420 --> 1:25:25.100]  Virginia, California and others. It's not coming. It's here. And then the inoculations. If you
[1:25:25.100 --> 1:25:30.620]  ever want to leave your house, which amounts to force inoculations. This is the medical tyranny
[1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:35.500]  takeover. These are not classic vaccines that have their own problems. These are DNA vaccines
[1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:41.900]  that change your DNA and are having massive serious side effects. Guaranteed this is about
[1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:47.900]  depopulation. Bill Gates admits that this is an emergency resist or die. The new world order is
[1:25:47.900 --> 1:25:52.460]  here. I'm going to say something right now. This is one of the most important things I've ever said.
[1:25:52.460 --> 1:25:59.260]  So please listen very, very carefully. Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or
[1:25:59.260 --> 1:26:04.460]  had the lockdown. They already have this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates.
[1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:10.220]  It is beyond critical. It is life and death for you and your family to understand. I'm not a real
[1:26:10.220 --> 1:26:17.100]  living on the planet, but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never
[1:26:17.100 --> 1:26:22.620]  going to end. The United Nations has admitted that first it's a month, then it's six months, then
[1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:27.980]  they say, okay, it's two years. They're now saying two years. They're now saying you'll never go back
[1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:34.300]  to normal. No more gatherings, no more anything. Constant force inoculations that they admit
[1:26:34.300 --> 1:26:40.940]  don't even work. And the way they say they work, they change your DNA. This is the culling of the
[1:26:40.940 --> 1:26:45.500]  planet. This is the beginning of the straight jacket being put on you before you're slowly
[1:26:45.500 --> 1:26:54.300]  tortured to death and killed, you understand? You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:25.660]  You know, we built band on video about a year and a half ago because we were banned off YouTube,
[1:27:26.460 --> 1:27:31.020]  banned off Twitter, banned off Facebook. And the sites had some hiccups, but it's been working
[1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:35.020]  really good for a while. Knock on wood because we had to move it to gigantic,
[1:27:35.020 --> 1:27:45.420]  very complex server systems because some days it's getting up to 8 million visitors.
[1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:54.140]  8 million videos clicked on watch. Most days it's 2 million. And that's good.
[1:27:57.900 --> 1:28:00.620]  Like those are old numbers. Most days now the average is about 4 million.
[1:28:01.420 --> 1:28:04.620]  And so you're spreading the word and a lot of new people are finding the truth. That's why
[1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:10.060]  Twitter, starting last Friday, began to put a notice saying this is dangerous hate speech.
[1:28:10.060 --> 1:28:16.060]  This is dangerous material. Don't click on it. But I think that's actually increases the clicks
[1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:22.860]  because people are like, stop telling me what I can and I can't do. So I didn't put Shadowgate
[1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:27.420]  immediately up Friday. Because like I said, it was just like, bam, the police are there.
[1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:35.820]  Is it something in the film? Remember the guy that took the photo on the submarine and just
[1:28:35.820 --> 1:28:40.220]  inadvertently showed a little part of the engine room and got put in prison? So I obviously wanted
[1:28:40.220 --> 1:28:43.820]  to watch something before I did a review or before I did it, but it just all happened where
[1:28:43.820 --> 1:28:49.660]  that didn't happen. And it got rushed out. And the whole thing just felt weird. It felt weird
[1:28:49.660 --> 1:28:57.660]  to everybody else. Like what's going on here? Something weird is about all of this. And again,
[1:28:57.660 --> 1:29:05.340]  I think Millie is a good person. I know she's a good person. But just imagine being a 29 year
[1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:10.220]  old mom and you get tens of millions of views a week on YouTube and Twitter and she's beautiful
[1:29:10.220 --> 1:29:14.860]  and she's smart. And then there's all these people that come around. And
[1:29:14.860 --> 1:29:22.700]  over the years, I know what those people have told her. Everybody goes at our employees and our
[1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:26.780]  reporters and tries to run them off. It's part of the Democrat side. And I learned to just ignore
[1:29:26.780 --> 1:29:31.580]  it. The secret weapon is just totally ignore it. Be all about business. And as soon as gossip
[1:29:31.580 --> 1:29:36.940]  starts, I just stop talking to people. And that always ends it. But then something blows up like
[1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:44.140]  this all crazy. And the main guy in the film that's just spook, we're all supposed to totally trust,
[1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:49.500]  says Roger Stones, the kingpin with no evidence. And then it's a film that we're promoting. And I
[1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:53.260]  said, you know what? They say that in the film. It's stupid. Overall, the film's good, though.
[1:29:53.260 --> 1:30:02.060]  I'll promote it. I'll just go with it. So go see the film where my partner, as he said, is the bad guy
[1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:09.180]  and that's hosted on my website, but you can't get anywhere else. It's the weirdness of being
[1:30:09.180 --> 1:30:15.660]  crapped on and then it being rubbed in, you know, but that's the celebrity culture. That's how all
[1:30:15.660 --> 1:30:23.420]  this stuff works. And it's just, it's just bizarre. And I don't defend Roger Stone because I've worked
[1:30:23.420 --> 1:30:32.860]  with him and I like him. I defend him because I defend the truth. I defend the truth. You know,
[1:30:32.860 --> 1:30:39.660]  Eslo Levant is very good at raising money. And he's a reputable, good guy that people try to
[1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:45.420]  take down and destroy as well. And we partnered with him to help Savannah. And we said, you need
[1:30:45.420 --> 1:30:49.260]  to be the guy to raise the money for Millie because you delivered all the person to a great job.
[1:30:49.260 --> 1:30:57.740]  She raised $155,000. See, I'm under such attack that I wouldn't even raise that money because I'm
[1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:01.900]  the guy that pays the paychecks and pays the expenses and pays the travel expenses. I'm the
[1:31:01.900 --> 1:31:06.780]  bad guy. I paid for the film where Roger's the bad guy. You got to understand that means I'm
[1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:12.140]  even worse. You understand who's super black up where I fund the film, you know, that I'm the bad
[1:31:12.140 --> 1:31:17.420]  guy, Roger's the bad guy. But, but that's just the crazy type of Easter eggs that people put into
[1:31:17.420 --> 1:31:22.380]  things. And that's just what I've got to understand. So I apologize for funding the film where I'm
[1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:26.780]  the bad guy. See, I can start going on for hours about this, but there are hundreds of radio
[1:31:26.780 --> 1:31:32.300]  stations picking us up that are tuned in to hear news and hear information. So I guess just the
[1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:39.900]  way to talk about this in general is there's a lot of sickness in society. And it's going to
[1:31:39.900 --> 1:31:45.580]  get worse because it's a spirit of evil and a spirit of delusion and a spirit of bearing false
[1:31:45.580 --> 1:31:52.300]  witness. And I've never tried to be a liar. I've never tried to hurt people that didn't have it
[1:31:52.300 --> 1:31:57.820]  coming. I've never made stuff up against people to hurt them. Because instinctively, I don't like
[1:31:57.820 --> 1:32:05.420]  lies. But I tell you really now today, the truth matters everything to me. Because I used to go
[1:32:05.420 --> 1:32:09.980]  fast and lose sometimes and get all excited and say something that I went too far or that was wrong,
[1:32:09.980 --> 1:32:23.900]  but it wasn't a conscious movement. But now I just value the truth so much that it's not about us
[1:32:23.900 --> 1:32:28.140]  being persecuted behind the scenes if I told you the stuff that's been done lately in association
[1:32:28.140 --> 1:32:34.620]  with us. But it's about people really knowing the truth. You know what I mean? Like people really
[1:32:34.620 --> 1:32:41.740]  need the truth. We don't need to sweep stuff under the rug. We don't need to do things like that.
[1:32:45.020 --> 1:32:48.220]  But there's another side of me that doesn't like infighting and things like that because that's a
[1:32:48.220 --> 1:32:51.900]  spirit of the world. So I go, well, I just better not go there. So I'm just going to get into the
[1:32:51.900 --> 1:32:56.700]  nose. I'm going to cover all that information. I'm going to get to all this really shocking footage
[1:32:56.700 --> 1:33:04.540]  out of Portland of what mob rule looks like. And the Antifa are wearing security outfits, black
[1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:09.580]  uniforms say security, and they're beating up a woman and they're beating up the man and they're
[1:33:09.580 --> 1:33:15.260]  robbing his vehicle. And they're calling themselves security and talking like they're cops because
[1:33:15.260 --> 1:33:20.620]  that's all this really is. See, when you get rid of the police in America, you get communist police
[1:33:20.620 --> 1:33:28.300]  and that's what it is. It's men beating women up. It's animal farm. George Arwell was a communist
[1:33:28.860 --> 1:33:35.580]  until he worked for the communist in the Spanish Civil War. And he saw that they were as bad as
[1:33:35.580 --> 1:33:41.500]  the fascist or worse because they were being accepted more than fascist and he watched the
[1:33:41.500 --> 1:33:48.940]  stuff they did to people. They watched the stuff they did to people and he just came back and said,
[1:33:48.940 --> 1:33:53.420]  this is unbelievable. He said, if you want to know what the future looks like under a Stalinist
[1:33:53.420 --> 1:33:59.740]  regime, it's a boot stomping on a human face forever. And that's what you just saw of your TV
[1:33:59.740 --> 1:34:05.420]  viewer is they're kicking him in the temple with, if I kick somebody like that and kill him.
[1:34:07.660 --> 1:34:12.540]  And the guy is brain damaged right now and they keep beating him and keep, and then they say,
[1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:17.900]  you're a wimp, get up. He tried to run us over and then they, it's like a woman looting the Louis
[1:34:17.900 --> 1:34:22.940]  Vuitton. She's going, I can't breathe. I can't. It's like a magic thing. It's okay. I'm stealing
[1:34:22.940 --> 1:34:30.140]  because I can't breathe. He tried to run me over. They grab his wife, beat her up. She begs for help
[1:34:30.140 --> 1:34:34.300]  while they kick him in the head and go, get up, get up. It's all like delusion. It's like saying
[1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:42.060]  Antifa doesn't exist out of a Nadler's mouth. It's a religion of lies. It's like, oh, he's not hurt.
[1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:50.060]  We didn't do anything. Here, get up, kick him back in the temple. And the guy was out driving
[1:34:50.060 --> 1:34:58.140]  around at night. He's a trendy. You know, he's got his girl. I bet she's got the job. I bet he
[1:34:58.140 --> 1:35:02.540]  doesn't have one. Just looking at the guy, just guessing. They're out having a nice night. He's
[1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:06.940]  like, hey, I'm trendy. I'm with you. They're like, no, your ass is white. He goes, you're white.
[1:35:06.940 --> 1:35:12.860]  This is on the tape. They say it doesn't matter. You're in a vehicle and a vehicle is an enemy
[1:35:12.860 --> 1:35:17.100]  combatant. We're going to say you tried to run us over because we follow the Soros directive.
[1:35:19.260 --> 1:35:27.420]  Take that cracker head. You don't have cornrows. You don't have a fake white afro.
[1:35:28.860 --> 1:35:34.220]  Your head is short hair. Maybe you don't have a lot of hair. Boom. You're white.
[1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:37.740]  We're going to make our bones on you.
[1:35:40.860 --> 1:35:45.340]  There's no violence from the left. They're good people. And all they've got is each other.
[1:35:46.620 --> 1:35:50.700]  I mean, you think this guy's political driving around in Portland at 10 o'clock at night?
[1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:58.460]  You see? And they just kept beating him. They just kept stomping him. They just kept attacking him.
[1:35:58.460 --> 1:36:05.340]  And he lets them beat up his wife, his girlfriend.
[1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:11.580]  That's still not enough. Well, they beat the woman.
[1:36:14.140 --> 1:36:17.900]  And she's like begging him, like, why? Why, lady? You got blonde hair.
[1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:24.540]  You're white. And the white people are going to show that they hate white people.
[1:36:24.540 --> 1:36:29.660]  They're going to show their heroes. Here comes my hero.
[1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:36.780]  Nothing like beating women.
[1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:43.100]  And he'll be out. They'll all be out. They'll all get rewards. They'll get jobs for Soros.
[1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:46.300]  And they'll see you in that death camp. They want to be over you and your family.
[1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:54.220]  Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and the list goes on from there.
[1:36:54.220 --> 1:36:58.780]  Have all gone on national TV and have all gone on the Internet and have been in the pages of
[1:36:58.780 --> 1:37:04.060]  the New York Times that they're wargaming contesting the election when they lose.
[1:37:04.060 --> 1:37:09.260]  They know there's a landslide. If they're unable to steal it, they're planning to contest it
[1:37:09.260 --> 1:37:15.420]  and have Democrat blue states secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for Joe Biden
[1:37:15.420 --> 1:37:20.380]  and the other public Kamala Harris. This has now been announced. And they're going to use
[1:37:20.380 --> 1:37:25.740]  race war and rioting as the cover to try to drive Trump from office. The Democratic Party,
[1:37:25.740 --> 1:37:31.420]  the chai comms, the deep state are using Black Lives Matter funded by Soros as their cover
[1:37:31.420 --> 1:37:37.100]  to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial riots and martial law,
[1:37:37.100 --> 1:37:42.540]  that you're racist. When in truth, an old Nazi collaborator, George Soros, created Black Lives
[1:37:42.540 --> 1:37:48.460]  Matter along with Antifa. America is fighting for its life, but we will win. Just a few months ago,
[1:37:48.460 --> 1:37:53.260]  almost every storeable food manufacturer was sold out. They were still taking people's orders and
[1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:57.340]  many of the companies have still not fulfilled them. All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.
[1:37:57.340 --> 1:38:01.340]  Our suppliers, the best, the highest quality, the best containers to transport it as well.
[1:38:01.340 --> 1:38:05.420]  And they've got the food with four factories in stock. Take some two to four weeks to get it
[1:38:05.420 --> 1:38:10.220]  shipped out to you. You need to order your storeable food now. The world is much more dire.
[1:38:10.220 --> 1:38:14.380]  The economic system is collapsing. The third world's already starving to death. Food prices
[1:38:14.380 --> 1:38:19.580]  are exploding here. The farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the COVID
[1:38:19.580 --> 1:38:24.060]  hoax. You need to get your storeable food while you still can at infowarstore.com. It's the 360
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:28.620]  win. It also funds our operation, but you need to get it whether three months, six months, a year.
[1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:33.180]  You need to get that now and have that checkbox off of being prepared and being self-sufficient.
[1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:37.180]  We also have high quality water filtration and air filtration at infowarstore.com. They're
[1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:42.140]  absolute must, but whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, don't wait until a bigger crisis comes.
[1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:45.100]  Don't wait until everybody panics. Take action. Get ready now.
[1:38:53.420 --> 1:39:00.140]  You hear that? That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[1:39:01.180 --> 1:39:06.940]  coming with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations
[1:39:06.940 --> 1:39:12.860]  and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society. They're outlawing people being able
[1:39:12.860 --> 1:39:17.900]  to get colds or the flu. They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes
[1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:23.500]  place. They're not even promising to have a cure to it all. They're just inflicting new phobias
[1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:29.660]  on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually
[1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:38.300]  change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft. It's a final frontier. It's the year 2020.
[1:39:39.660 --> 1:39:44.780]  It's not coming. It's here. And submission is blood in the water.
[1:39:47.980 --> 1:39:54.060]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had serious
[1:39:54.060 --> 1:39:59.900]  cognitive problems. He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist
[1:39:59.900 --> 1:40:05.260]  and their allied crime syndicates. Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[1:40:05.260 --> 1:40:11.500]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai comms and others. So she has been chosen
[1:40:12.060 --> 1:40:18.620]  because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her will be called a racist and evil
[1:40:18.620 --> 1:40:25.660]  and she is now above reproach. Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[1:40:25.660 --> 1:40:30.620]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[1:40:30.620 --> 1:40:37.100]  than white people. That the woman is a monster. Kamala Harris will end up being our president
[1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:43.020]  if they're able to steal the election. And she is a 110 percent new world order puppet.
[1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:49.020]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster. We must expose the globalist.
[1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:38.940]  You know, I don't want to cover this story because it's not important for all the great radio and
[1:41:38.940 --> 1:41:44.220]  TV listeners out there with the big picture of the worldwide COVID lockdown that is the post
[1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:48.700]  human world that they're setting up and just how dire this is. Now they want to get us all caught up
[1:41:49.420 --> 1:41:57.420]  in all the little minutia. But I just got this article. I stand over it. I'm going to read over
[1:41:57.420 --> 1:42:05.420]  it again during the next break and I may comment on it because it's all they've got to file
[1:42:05.420 --> 1:42:13.660]  was seven Sandy Hook lawsuits against me, including people's names I never said are suing me.
[1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:17.180]  I mean, state law says in Connecticut and Texas, you can't do that.
[1:42:19.740 --> 1:42:26.060]  And then they have this appeals court judge in Austin, Triana Banks, who literally is best friends
[1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:30.860]  with the Austin judge. And the Austin judge said in the first hearing, I think Alex Jones
[1:42:30.860 --> 1:42:34.300]  has a first amendment, but he needs to pay for what he did to these families. Didn't do anything to
[1:42:34.300 --> 1:42:38.220]  him. The internet questioned the event because of all the hoaxes. It was never my identity.
[1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:43.180]  I barely talked about it. They obsess over it and use my name to keep Sandy Hook and the news
[1:42:43.180 --> 1:42:50.300]  constantly. And then they just constantly file stuff at the appeals courts on us and on what
[1:42:50.300 --> 1:42:57.100]  we're doing. And the way it works in Texas is you can appeal before it ever goes to court
[1:42:58.140 --> 1:43:02.380]  with the anti slap, the frivolous stuff, and you can appeal it again before it ever goes there.
[1:43:02.380 --> 1:43:07.660]  And we're appealing all this because the law is very clear, but it hits this local court of appeals
[1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:12.940]  and they're going to fry me no matter what happens. If they take over the Supreme Court,
[1:43:12.940 --> 1:43:17.820]  they'll do it there as well. So obviously I'm fighting for my rights, but you see these headlines
[1:43:17.820 --> 1:43:25.100]  that go up everywhere constantly. Alex Jones info wars continues losing streak on appeals over Sandy
[1:43:25.100 --> 1:43:32.380]  Hook lawsuits. And then you read it and has no reflection in reality and they use some three-year-old,
[1:43:32.380 --> 1:43:37.740]  four-year-old photo. And they do it over and over again because they want to shut us down.
[1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:41.500]  The establishment wants us off the air. And they know that the public has woken up to the
[1:43:41.500 --> 1:43:48.540]  establishment. And so their argument is, oh, Jones is secretly the establishment. That's right.
[1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:53.980]  You know, we had a great event this Saturday. I probably picked a park entrance that was too
[1:43:53.980 --> 1:43:57.260]  long to go through. Some people got overheated, but we went down and swam in the creek. It was
[1:43:57.260 --> 1:44:01.900]  great, great event. Maybe I'll play a clip of it next hour. Let's hit band on video.
[1:44:03.660 --> 1:44:09.580]  And I shook 200 hands at least. But I probably had 20 people ask me, you know, are you for real?
[1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:15.660]  What the hell does that mean? You judge a tree by its fruits.
[1:44:17.660 --> 1:44:23.500]  What are our fruits? The truth, a track record of steadfastness and supporting justice and
[1:44:23.500 --> 1:44:30.380]  standing up for everybody's rights and being honorable. But it doesn't hurt my feelings that
[1:44:30.380 --> 1:44:35.180]  people ask me that. It hurts my feelings that we don't have time to play games with this.
[1:44:35.180 --> 1:44:40.140]  You don't need to know if I'm for real. Of course I'm for real. Orts and all. I'm a good person.
[1:44:40.140 --> 1:44:44.700]  I love God. I love you. I love justice, but I'm not perfect. But I'm not consciously trying to do
[1:44:44.700 --> 1:44:55.420]  bad things. I mean, I like women. There's nothing wrong about that. I like food. I'm a lustful
[1:44:55.420 --> 1:45:00.940]  person. That's about it. But the extent of the bad stuff, that plenty of courage, plenty of will.
[1:45:01.820 --> 1:45:09.660]  But the thing is, it's not about me. The globalists are coming against us. World government is here.
[1:45:09.660 --> 1:45:15.900]  It's out in the open. Anybody can go read event 201. Anybody can go read Bill Gates saying the
[1:45:15.900 --> 1:45:22.940]  lockdown never ends. Anybody, anybody can go read Operation Lockstep by the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:30.860]  about setting up a planetary prison, a global police state. I mean, at the end of humanity,
[1:45:30.860 --> 1:45:35.500]  as we know it, and the shutdown of the industrialized world to make populations collapse.
[1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:39.500]  Do you know what that means?
[1:45:42.540 --> 1:45:47.340]  I mean, I'm sitting here telling you this is going on. You can verify it. And then all the
[1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:52.700]  globalists do is change the subject to infighting, just like the race rioting and the divide and
[1:45:52.700 --> 1:45:59.900]  conquer. That's all empires do is divide and conquer people. That's all they've got.
[1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:09.900]  And then I watch. Classically, that done does over and over again by people we think are our friends,
[1:46:09.900 --> 1:46:14.300]  people that we've supported and financed and everything for and done nothing but been loving
[1:46:14.300 --> 1:46:18.060]  and good. And then to have a knife stuck in your back over and over again. It just makes
[1:46:18.060 --> 1:46:23.500]  you sad for people. I'm not a victim. I don't feel sorry for myself. I wonder how are we turning
[1:46:23.500 --> 1:46:28.860]  out so many twisted screwed up people that don't know honor or justice or freedom. And all they
[1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:36.940]  know is betrayal and lies. The left ignoring all the real pedophilia and then making up the
[1:46:36.940 --> 1:46:40.380]  me too movement and having women go out and lie and say all these men did stuff to them.
[1:46:43.740 --> 1:46:48.620]  And then these evil Congress women, Maxine Waters and others running around saying we need
[1:46:49.820 --> 1:46:55.420]  to have all this violence. We need to go out and have Sibyl unrest. Let's play that clip.
[1:46:55.420 --> 1:47:03.260]  Representative Presley, Anya Presley, always saying horrible stuff, had this to say.
[1:47:07.580 --> 1:47:08.540]  Public outcry.
[1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:18.380]  Let's just hit pause. Started over from the beginning. I'll be able to hear this. Here it is.
[1:47:19.340 --> 1:47:24.940]  I'm looking to the public. You know, this is as much about public outcry and organizing
[1:47:24.940 --> 1:47:30.460]  and mobilizing and applying pressure so that this GOP led Senate and that these governors that
[1:47:30.460 --> 1:47:35.180]  continue to carry water for this administration, putting the American peoples in harm's way,
[1:47:36.940 --> 1:47:42.620]  turning a deaf ear to the needs of our families and our communities, hold them accountable.
[1:47:44.140 --> 1:47:49.260]  Well, make the phone calls in the email show up. You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets
[1:47:49.260 --> 1:47:55.580]  for as long as there is unrest in our lives. And unfortunately, there's plenty to go around.
[1:47:55.580 --> 1:48:00.780]  And the arrogance and the way they get certain leftist black people, leftist women,
[1:48:02.060 --> 1:48:07.260]  and they put them up there and then they're all under attack in America's bad. Never worried
[1:48:07.260 --> 1:48:11.260]  about communist China, the death camps for Muslims, for Christians. No, no, it's all fake
[1:48:11.260 --> 1:48:15.580]  because they know America's weak and we'll roll over to them and go, I'm sorry. I want to be bad.
[1:48:15.580 --> 1:48:21.180]  I want to prove to you I'm good, please. And then every day, the knockout games,
[1:48:21.180 --> 1:48:25.580]  white people being shot, stabbed, murdered, run over, pulled out of their cars, beat up.
[1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:31.820]  That little five-year-old kid got shot in the head. The media put out that his dad did drugs
[1:48:31.820 --> 1:48:36.060]  with the other guy, just made it up and Twitter pushed it to the top, even though they did it
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:41.900]  was a fake police report because they had to dehumanize that little white boy to get more
[1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:46.620]  killing going because the black folks saw that white kid getting killed. Maybe they'd say,
[1:48:46.620 --> 1:48:50.300]  hey, there's just bad people in the world. Let's not blame black people. Let's not blame white
[1:48:50.300 --> 1:48:56.300]  people. Let's blame the individual. They don't do that because this woman, she gets up there and she
[1:48:56.300 --> 1:49:00.780]  says, hey, we need more unrest. Well, you're getting the unrest. And if somebody's white,
[1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:05.420]  well, their wife gets drug out of the car and then they run away and then they get drug out,
[1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:11.980]  trying to drive around the crowds, trying to kill them. They're chasing the guy down the street,
[1:49:11.980 --> 1:49:15.500]  pulling their bikes in front of him. He runs in to a telephone pole, trying to drive down the
[1:49:15.500 --> 1:49:19.100]  sidewalk to get away because they're out in the road and they're screaming, don't run me over.
[1:49:19.100 --> 1:49:23.180]  It's like the video last week where they're aiming guns in Indiana at the guy on the road,
[1:49:23.180 --> 1:49:27.500]  blocking him. He tries to drive around through a parking lot. They run going, don't run me over.
[1:49:27.500 --> 1:49:32.220]  He's like 100, running as fast as they can to get in front and be victims and jump on the vehicle.
[1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:37.660]  Oh, God, I'm a victim. They want to recreate that Charlottesville and be those heroes.
[1:49:39.900 --> 1:49:43.420]  Hortland rioters viciously beat man unconscious every, crashes his truck,
[1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:48.140]  and now they're calling him a proud boy and all this made up stuff. Go ahead and roll the tape.
[1:49:48.140 --> 1:49:55.660]  He's ready to lose his girlfriend, beating her up.
[1:49:58.700 --> 1:50:03.100]  A tackler from the man, a man attacking women. He deserves it. He's like,
[1:50:07.660 --> 1:50:10.780]  saying, back up, go back, back up down the highway, back up down the road.
[1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:17.420]  Now they've got him out. He just goes on and he's like 10 minutes of this.
[1:50:17.420 --> 1:50:19.420]  He's kicking him in the head, stomping.
[1:50:22.700 --> 1:50:24.780]  Guy runs like he's taking a field goal, kicks him in the head.
[1:50:27.180 --> 1:50:30.540]  And then they go on and say, get up. You're not hurt.
[1:50:34.060 --> 1:50:37.020]  Of course, he's really knocked out. Then they rob his vehicle.
[1:50:37.020 --> 1:50:46.220]  He's just the scum of the earth, man. No souls, no empathy, no connection.
[1:50:49.020 --> 1:50:57.260]  Obese liberals. Imagine a bunch of black people with white people beating up a white guy.
[1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:01.260]  And now they're calling him a wimp because he's, he's hurt bad.
[1:51:01.980 --> 1:51:04.940]  Reportedly he's brain damaged in the hospital because they stomped his head a bunch.
[1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:09.180]  There's more fun than this. I mean, look at the back of his head.
[1:51:12.300 --> 1:51:13.580]  Now they're laughing. I'll screw you.
[1:51:17.740 --> 1:51:21.580]  Oh, he's a faker. He's in a bullet blood. Blood's coming out his mouth.
[1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:36.140]  We're so liberal. We're such good people. We're so good.
[1:51:37.660 --> 1:51:41.740]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now
[1:51:41.740 --> 1:51:45.500]  Democrat leaders are calling for people to be charged with attempted murder if they don't wear
[1:51:45.500 --> 1:51:49.820]  the mask of the symbols of slavery and they've triggered their race riots around the country
[1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:55.260]  led by white, angry liberal academics and others. And now on top of the Democrats are officially
[1:51:55.260 --> 1:51:59.660]  saying, hey, Trump's going to try to steal the election in contestant, but then their internal
[1:51:59.660 --> 1:52:05.100]  war gaming documents come out with John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and of course
[1:52:05.100 --> 1:52:09.100]  Joe Biden. And they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have
[1:52:09.100 --> 1:52:14.300]  the Democrat state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote. And we are then
[1:52:14.300 --> 1:52:17.580]  going to set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[1:52:17.580 --> 1:52:21.420]  This is officially in the New York Times. I don't just believe the New York Times.
[1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:25.340]  I've been telling you for over a year, this is their plan from other statements they've made
[1:52:25.340 --> 1:52:29.260]  in the Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London,
[1:52:29.260 --> 1:52:33.420]  and the Council on Foreign Relations. This is their plan. We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[1:52:33.420 --> 1:52:36.780]  What are you going to do? I'm serious, folks. This is the time to save the country.
[1:52:38.780 --> 1:52:44.140]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything. They also bet
[1:52:44.140 --> 1:52:48.460]  as they constantly talk about it in their own words, that you will adapt to being a slave,
[1:52:48.460 --> 1:52:54.460]  that you will learn incrementally to submit. So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci
[1:52:54.460 --> 1:53:00.220]  fraud. Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie. They lied about where it came
[1:53:00.220 --> 1:53:05.020]  from. They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death
[1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:13.260]  rate at 4%, but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping. Then they set the test up to count
[1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:18.140]  almost all false positives. They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID
[1:53:18.140 --> 1:53:23.020]  column. They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown. Now we're six months later. Now they say it's
[1:53:23.020 --> 1:53:26.940]  permanent. You've got to wear masks forever, and force inoculations are coming, and they're
[1:53:26.940 --> 1:53:30.220]  going to track everywhere you go with what you do, the global social credit score,
[1:53:30.220 --> 1:53:34.860]  and the UN is the boss. Anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job.
[1:53:34.860 --> 1:53:38.140]  That's called 21st-century tyranny. That's called world government takeover.
[1:53:38.140 --> 1:53:44.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:52.460 --> 1:53:55.900]  You know, I can't back down because they used to get you quicker that way.
[1:53:56.460 --> 1:54:03.500]  Well, I won't back down. No, I'll stand my ground. No, I won't back down.
[1:54:03.500 --> 1:54:13.340]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down. I know what's right.
[1:54:13.340 --> 1:54:23.980]  Gonna stand my ground. Won't be turned around. Won't be turned around, and I'll keep this world
[1:54:23.980 --> 1:54:30.140]  from dragging me down. Here's the most important part. No, I know what's right,
[1:54:30.140 --> 1:54:39.580]  and I won't back down. I got just one life. Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out.
[1:54:39.580 --> 1:54:47.260]  There ain't no easy way out. Hey, you gotta find that out now, folks. Stand my ground.
[1:54:47.260 --> 1:55:01.260]  We'll stand my ground. And I won't back down. It's harder to back down. Freedom and justice,
[1:55:01.260 --> 1:55:08.220]  everything good comes from not backing down. Well, I know what's right. I got just one life.
[1:55:08.220 --> 1:55:19.500]  I got just one life in a world that keeps on pushing me around, but I stand my ground,
[1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:26.140]  and I won't back down. Yeah, Tom Perry does a great job with that song, and I think old
[1:55:27.180 --> 1:55:34.060]  Johnny Cash does a better job. There ain't no easy way out. Oh, easy way out. I'll have a podcast
[1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:43.260]  called that. I won't back down. We'll stand my ground. All right. And I won't. You know,
[1:55:46.380 --> 1:55:49.180]  John Bowne did a really good report that really should be aired,
[1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:54.300]  and there's so many others, but Austin, Texas, and now the home invasion capital of the world.
[1:55:57.500 --> 1:56:02.300]  And just five years ago, it had a very low crime rate. It's dangerous as hell,
[1:56:02.300 --> 1:56:08.300]  and they've had trouble suppressing those numbers. And now they're cutting the police budget 20-plus
[1:56:08.300 --> 1:56:16.940]  percent, and they're going to have the police, though, doing all this new social stuff messing
[1:56:16.940 --> 1:56:21.180]  with everybody that's in the criminal. I mean, I tell you, man, it's so screwed up.
[1:56:22.380 --> 1:56:25.900]  And if you think the police got problems now, and they do, because everybody's got problems,
[1:56:25.900 --> 1:56:32.460]  you just imagine till they're SJW it out like the UK, man, the footage coming out of the UK
[1:56:33.020 --> 1:56:36.220]  where they walk up to Nigel Farage, who could have been the prime minister,
[1:56:36.220 --> 1:56:40.540]  most popular man in the UK, probably in Europe, a rock star of Liberty.
[1:56:42.700 --> 1:56:46.220]  And they come up to him and they say, you're not allowed to videotape these boats,
[1:56:46.220 --> 1:56:51.180]  Landon, we're going to arrest you. You don't get out of here. It's all in a fake leftist British
[1:56:51.180 --> 1:56:57.980]  accent. But there's nothing, nothing soft about it. It's hardcore tyranny. And the Australian
[1:56:57.980 --> 1:57:04.140]  police, because Aussies are great people, but they've always had bad cops because they were a
[1:57:04.140 --> 1:57:10.620]  prison colony. And I mean, you know, if you've smarted off in those work camps, whatever they
[1:57:10.620 --> 1:57:19.660]  hang your ass. So I mean, they catch a mom out there with her mask on, you're not allowed,
[1:57:19.660 --> 1:57:24.060]  they walk right up to slam her head around the walls or choking her. The woman goes,
[1:57:24.060 --> 1:57:27.980]  please don't choke me. And they keep choking saying she's a resisting because they tell them,
[1:57:27.980 --> 1:57:33.740]  you go out there and you brutalize women. We want the images of women being brutalized.
[1:57:33.740 --> 1:57:38.380]  And then you get all these videos of them choking women and it's men choking women
[1:57:38.380 --> 1:57:42.540]  in front of their kids. You say, why do they do that? Because they're teaching yo ass that you're
[1:57:42.540 --> 1:57:54.540]  a slave. They're teaching you that they are God. And if it's a white guy beating up a black guy
[1:57:54.540 --> 1:57:58.780]  for not wearing a mask, it's okay. If it's a white guy choking a woman, it's okay.
[1:58:00.380 --> 1:58:05.980]  Because they're heroes, man. They're saving you from the COVID. Bill Gates said it ain't ever
[1:58:05.980 --> 1:58:10.140]  coming back. You ain't ever living again. You ain't ever having a job. You're not essential.
[1:58:10.140 --> 1:58:13.420]  You're going to sit in your house. Well, everything crumbles by the time you figure
[1:58:13.420 --> 1:58:19.820]  out it's an orchestrated depression. Well, that's too late, ain't it? How long has it been since
[1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:26.380]  you had a big steaming bowl of mass collapse and famine and death and war? Well, that's too long.
[1:58:27.340 --> 1:58:32.460]  You're going to get what those babies get their mama when they dump that acid bath in there for
[1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:42.780]  a day and a half while their skin burns off. You're all going to get hurt real bad now and I am too.
[1:59:02.940 --> 1:59:08.700]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based
[1:59:08.700 --> 1:59:14.860]  line forms. That's why they say carbon is bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of
[1:59:14.860 --> 1:59:22.140]  the planet. They are playing God. They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[1:59:22.140 --> 1:59:28.540]  that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation. I know this sounds
[1:59:28.540 --> 1:59:34.460]  insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record. You have been
[1:59:34.460 --> 1:59:41.740]  warned. You have been given the information to say no to this plan. This is the end of all life
[1:59:41.740 --> 1:59:53.260]  on earth as we know it. This is the alien takeover of earth rallying patriots worldwide in defense
[1:59:53.260 --> 2:00:03.420]  of human liberty. It's Alex Jones. Welcome to the new leftist city. Once very low crime rates
[2:00:03.420 --> 2:00:07.900]  seen as the best city to live in. The left moved here and in just a couple years it's now one of
[2:00:07.900 --> 2:00:13.500]  the most undesirable feces, needles and the highest crime rate in the state of Texas, almost the
[2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:19.660]  country for home invasions because in came the left that don't have guns. The predators know
[2:00:19.660 --> 2:00:27.420]  if you've got a democrat sticker on your house, Rob, Rob, Rob. Communists sympathizer and district
[2:00:27.420 --> 2:00:33.100]  four city council member Gregorio Cazar has spearheaded the left's inevitable engineered demise
[2:00:33.100 --> 2:00:39.020]  of Austin, Texas. Cazar and the totalitarian mob running the Austin, Texas city council have signed
[2:00:39.020 --> 2:00:44.940]  off on ultimately cutting $150 million from the Austin police department that is already stretched
[2:00:44.940 --> 2:00:51.260]  thin by a metro area that is rapidly expanding and growing by 4% on average every year and has
[2:00:51.260 --> 2:00:57.820]  a crime index that is higher than 83% of other US cities, not to mention that a majority of Austin
[2:00:57.820 --> 2:01:03.980] ites opposed the funding the police as a survey conducted from July 14th to the 17th found a
[2:01:03.980 --> 2:01:12.380]  majority of respondents 53% to 40% do not support reducing officers according to the greater Austin
[2:01:12.380 --> 2:01:18.940]  crime commission. This survey also found that 47% of Austin voters believe the city is on the wrong
[2:01:18.940 --> 2:01:25.980]  track 84% of those surveyed were dissatisfied with the handling of the homeless 92% of Austin
[2:01:25.980 --> 2:01:32.700]  voters feel safe in their neighborhoods but only 56% feel safe downtown and there was overwhelming
[2:01:32.700 --> 2:01:38.540]  performance satisfaction for the Austin fire department and the Austin Travis County EMS
[2:01:38.540 --> 2:01:45.180]  but the safety of Austinites is obsolete to Marxist idealism as 21 million dollars will
[2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:50.700]  immediately be reinvested into reimagining of housing programs and victim and mental health
[2:01:50.700 --> 2:01:56.780]  services cutting cadet classes and overtime pay as another 80 million will minimize the
[2:01:56.780 --> 2:02:02.940]  departments of the forensic labs communications victim services community partnerships and roughly
[2:02:02.940 --> 2:02:08.700]  50 million will be reimagined and cut down other programs within the department but the
[2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:14.780]  Austin City Council found another 250 thousand dollars to give to their abortion care practical
[2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:20.460]  support program police chief Brian Manley calmly set the table for what Austinites can expect
[2:02:20.460 --> 2:02:27.100]  when requiring the aid of law enforcement in the future and as everyone is aware as a result of
[2:02:27.100 --> 2:02:32.860]  the budget that was passed earlier today by the mayor and city council we are going to see some
[2:02:32.860 --> 2:02:37.340]  fundamental changes here at the police department changes that we've not seen in my 30 years since
[2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:43.660]  I've been here with the reduction of 150 police officer positions in the Austin police department
[2:02:43.660 --> 2:02:50.140]  we will go back to a staffing level that we were at back in 2015 so this will require
[2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:56.700]  some work uh with me and my team is there any plan right now to change the security detail for
[2:02:56.700 --> 2:03:02.220]  council members there are no plans for that right now we have many units that will be under
[2:03:02.220 --> 2:03:07.100]  consideration as we figure where we will pull officers from again we're going to have to move
[2:03:07.100 --> 2:03:13.420]  officers out of specialized details to put them into the patrol function so we can maintain adequate
[2:03:13.420 --> 2:03:19.740]  resources on patrol while Texas Governor Abbott told Newsweek Austin's decision puts the brave men
[2:03:19.740 --> 2:03:24.140]  and women of the Austin police department and their families at greater risk and paves the
[2:03:24.140 --> 2:03:30.620]  way for lawlessness public safety is job one and Austin has abandoned that duty but in the meantime
[2:03:30.620 --> 2:03:35.980]  the Texas department of public safety will stand in the gap to protect our capital city
[2:03:35.980 --> 2:03:42.140]  rapes burglaries and theft in Austin is already above the state average and home invasions are a
[2:03:42.140 --> 2:03:48.220]  constant police say four suspects broke into an apartment and robbed the victim and child
[2:03:48.220 --> 2:03:54.380]  at gunpoint overnight investigators releasing the gut wrenching 911 call made moments after
[2:03:54.380 --> 2:04:00.460]  intruders broke into a texas home in the middle of the night killing this young father as he tried
[2:04:00.460 --> 2:04:06.220]  to defend his family i need help me help so bad deputies say allen broke into the home and robbed
[2:04:06.220 --> 2:04:11.580]  the woman at gunpoint at one point the victim says allen zip tied her ankles and wrists together
[2:04:11.580 --> 2:04:16.700]  he told her not to move for at least five minutes and said i know where you live and that you have
[2:04:16.700 --> 2:04:21.900]  a son lucero vasquez and her daughter were fast asleep at around nine o'clock Wednesday morning
[2:04:21.900 --> 2:04:27.900]  at this northeast austin apartment complex her husband was at work what woke them up was completely
[2:04:27.900 --> 2:04:35.180]  unexpected it was a man dressed in blue with a cap the same from the video in that video was
[2:04:35.180 --> 2:04:40.620]  caught by this camera up above showing the man who awesome police say kicked in the door walked into
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:46.620]  vasquez's bedroom and demanded money say three people broke into an apartment as part of a home
[2:04:46.620 --> 2:04:52.460]  invasion robbery the residents were home at the time and responded by shooting the suspects two
[2:04:52.460 --> 2:04:58.060]  of the three people were killed the third suspect was taken to a local hospital the email stated two
[2:04:58.060 --> 2:05:04.620]  students saying two men kicked in the door to their apartment struck them with rifles stole their
[2:05:04.620 --> 2:05:10.940]  belongings and left but the austin city council literally calls to have apd headquarters blown
[2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:17.420]  up instead transforming the international destination of south by southwest and the austin city limits
[2:05:17.420 --> 2:05:23.340]  festival into a crime riddled homeless shelter akin to los angeles and san francisco you know we
[2:05:23.340 --> 2:05:28.780]  have a person's belongings right next to our patio they've been here for weeks we can't say anything
[2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:34.780]  about it apd can't say anything about it it's an obstruction so you know that that's a very gray
[2:05:34.780 --> 2:05:39.820]  definition with the ordinance changed it's not just downtown michael cargill owner of central
[2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:44.300]  texas gunworks in south austin captured this on store surveillance he was pretty much just
[2:05:44.300 --> 2:05:49.100]  terrorizing the ladies that were leaving businesses trying to get to their vehicle uh he threatened
[2:05:49.100 --> 2:05:55.980]  to you know kill someone kill a lady he's took probably about an hour and 30 minutes or so to
[2:05:55.980 --> 2:06:01.820]  show up cargill says he also captured this with his cell phone defecating and some other stuff and
[2:06:01.820 --> 2:06:08.060]  also shooting up you know right by our front door most of the country is currently fleeing in droves
[2:06:08.060 --> 2:06:15.660]  two cities just like austin have you ever seen this is what the media did not show look at everything
[2:06:15.660 --> 2:06:25.180]  everything for even the hotel is boarded up this is old manhattan boarded up but before you know it
[2:06:25.180 --> 2:06:32.060]  cities like austin will represent the hellholes those people are rapidly fleeing from john bound
[2:06:32.060 --> 2:06:37.980]  reporting and by the way what's crazy is they did a news report with cargill
[2:06:38.860 --> 2:06:45.660]  who's a good friend of mine and he's not even a bad area austin they've been robbed attacked shot
[2:06:45.660 --> 2:06:51.420]  up you hear him go and we at shooting up no they've been shot up remember when they tried to break in

[2:06:57.020 --> 2:07:03.580]  and and folks they're robbing the fancy neighborhoods they're robbing it all now and the good news is
[2:07:03.580 --> 2:07:08.620]  all the liberals i know that my wife knows because you know she used to be a liberal
[2:07:10.380 --> 2:07:14.700]  i would call her leftist they're all buying guns and shotguns and now her liberal friends
[2:07:14.700 --> 2:07:19.660]  are like apologizing and saying you're right oh my god what do we do it's not about being right it's
[2:07:19.660 --> 2:07:23.340]  just like let me say something here really really important
[2:07:29.500 --> 2:07:37.500]  when the un signs a treaty with almost every nation on earth in 1992 to by 2020 being full
[2:07:37.500 --> 2:07:45.820]  swing for a post industrial world that causes an 80 population collapse by 2050 if you look at the
[2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:52.540]  numbers and what that would do it's road warrior into the world stuff i mean revelation says the
[2:07:52.540 --> 2:07:57.660]  antichrist kills what is it two thirds of the earth i forget you know died during all this well the
[2:07:57.660 --> 2:08:04.700]  u n says 80 what do you think this is gonna be like you think this is gonna be fun you think
[2:08:04.700 --> 2:08:09.100]  you're just gonna silver surf through the whole deal and it's gonna be it's gonna be cakes and lions
[2:08:09.100 --> 2:08:18.700]  and teddy bears and unicorns no folks it ain't gonna be lucky charms and and people go all the
[2:08:18.700 --> 2:08:25.660]  left is inept they collapse everywhere they go and mental illness they're not inept the front
[2:08:25.660 --> 2:08:34.220]  people are you think Pelosi and uh maxine waters and and and and nadler that can't even hardly talk
[2:08:34.220 --> 2:08:43.260]  run anything they're told what to say you think joe biden runs anything joe biden's in there because
[2:08:43.260 --> 2:08:50.780]  he'll do what he's told and he's so stupid he'll destroy his own future his own children's future
[2:08:54.620 --> 2:09:00.540]  they're engineering this whole thing on purpose and they admit they are it's not like i'm just
[2:09:00.540 --> 2:09:04.940]  saying oh it's obviously engineered they say they're collapsing everything
[2:09:07.820 --> 2:09:12.460]  the u n admits 130 something million are going to starve to death under a year of covid lockdown
[2:09:12.460 --> 2:09:15.820]  we're already eight months in and guess what millions are starving to death they just die in
[2:09:15.820 --> 2:09:22.060]  their sleep folks and they just say oh malnutrition and then you'll be walking down the street there's
[2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:26.860]  some arrogant black person knowing you white people need to do something for us oh what if you
[2:09:26.860 --> 2:09:32.540]  need to do something for everybody it's disgusting like all these bloated weird black lives matter
[2:09:32.540 --> 2:09:37.260]  women that run everything they don't say a word about death camps in china they don't give a fly
[2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:42.700]  and you know what they're all a bunch of devil worship and trash and it's all gonna go down now
[2:09:42.700 --> 2:09:48.540]  folks i'm gonna say something right now but it's one of the most important things i've ever said
[2:09:48.540 --> 2:09:55.660]  so please listen very very carefully donald trump is not the reason they released covid or had the
[2:09:55.660 --> 2:10:02.780]  lockdown they already had this plan the rockefeller foundation and billa melinda gates it is beyond
[2:10:02.780 --> 2:10:06.540]  critical it is life and death for you and your family to understand no matter where you live on
[2:10:06.540 --> 2:10:13.980]  the planet but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end
[2:10:14.700 --> 2:10:19.260]  the united nations has admitted that first it's a month then it's six months then they say okay
[2:10:19.260 --> 2:10:26.140]  it's two years they're now saying two years they're now saying you'll never go back to normal no more
[2:10:26.140 --> 2:10:31.100]  gatherings no more anything constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work
[2:10:32.060 --> 2:10:38.540]  in the way they say they work they change your dna this is the culling of the planet this is the
[2:10:38.540 --> 2:10:43.260]  beginning of a straight jacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured to death and kill
[2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:52.300]  do you understand how do you contest an election in the year 2020 well you trigger race riots and
[2:10:52.300 --> 2:10:57.180]  you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're the speaker of the house that you are legitimately
[2:10:57.180 --> 2:11:02.540]  now the president that's what she said on cbs news and that you're going to have those blue
[2:11:02.540 --> 2:11:08.460]  states succeed yes that's officially called a civil war ladies and gentlemen and the democrats
[2:11:08.460 --> 2:11:13.660]  are backed by the eu hollywood the chai comms and the whole global system this is treason with a
[2:11:13.660 --> 2:11:19.260]  capital t and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards they won't even stand up against
[2:11:19.260 --> 2:11:23.740]  and do anything even though our president has been exposing it but here's the bottom line
[2:11:23.740 --> 2:11:28.060]  you need storeable food we've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now two to four week
[2:11:28.060 --> 2:11:32.540]  delivery with 80 days out from the election you need to get high quality storeable food right now
[2:11:32.540 --> 2:11:36.620]  in case they are able to pull this off we're gonna have a great depression war on the streets
[2:11:36.620 --> 2:11:40.540]  that will make a road warrior look like a cake walk your high quality storeable foods now and get
[2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:49.900]  ready to get prepared at infowarstore.com get prepared you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:49.900 --> 2:12:03.580]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show
[2:12:06.860 --> 2:12:11.020]  you know i don't care about hollywood i don't care about status i don't care about the world's
[2:12:11.020 --> 2:12:21.260]  power but i do care about human life and our souls and i know the most effective thing i do is calling
[2:12:21.260 --> 2:12:27.900]  different globalists out by name and putting messages directly out to them and at a subconscious
[2:12:27.900 --> 2:12:33.100]  level i hold back because that's the one time you can really piss them off and they go ahead and
[2:12:33.100 --> 2:12:37.660]  have you killed and it's not that i'm afraid of dying i just don't want to do suicidal things
[2:12:37.660 --> 2:12:43.900]  suicide by globalist and so literally the holy spirit holds me back from it but now the holy
[2:12:43.900 --> 2:12:49.740]  spirit has told me to go ahead and attack and here's the issue after years of holding back
[2:12:49.740 --> 2:12:54.540]  i've been holding back ladies and gentlemen the real oratory skills and the real analysis and the
[2:12:54.540 --> 2:13:04.380]  will god this morning told me that it's time to release the will and uh so i'm just putting everybody
[2:13:04.380 --> 2:13:10.780]  on notice it starts today i'm not holding back anything anymore i'm gonna this is not my will
[2:13:10.780 --> 2:13:16.540]  it's god's will god's told me to really step it up and not pull back out of not wanting to be arrogant
[2:13:16.540 --> 2:13:24.060]  or prideful because you know really being what i what you can all do too really really being who i
[2:13:24.060 --> 2:13:29.740]  can be and really using my brain against the enemy and my will is a terrible thing it's terrible
[2:13:29.740 --> 2:13:35.580]  i'm scared of it and i know it means the enemy's gonna come after us too but it has to be done
[2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:40.860]  now is the time it's very humbling um you know praying for me is very humbling to do that in
[2:13:40.860 --> 2:13:48.060]  public because i when i pray i am in the presence of god even stronger and messages the president
[2:13:48.060 --> 2:13:53.500]  are very humbling because i know that trump's dialed into the metaphysical and if i say this is
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:59.900]  a message to trump he gets it and that's why i don't do a lot of them because
[2:14:02.060 --> 2:14:05.420]  it's it's it's not that i'm intimidated to talk to the president it's that i better
[2:14:05.980 --> 2:14:10.140]  i better have something important to say when i do it so
[2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:19.980]  if i try not to hurt people and if i try to hold back it's just not gonna flow so
[2:14:19.980 --> 2:14:25.500]  so it's gonna probably have some fits and starts but i'm just gonna let them have it and
[2:14:27.660 --> 2:14:32.300]  it's like a pressure you know in that millisecond of bomb detonates starting to build up right now
[2:14:33.260 --> 2:14:38.780]  and i just want the listeners and viewers to know it's in force it's about to go next level
[2:14:39.980 --> 2:14:43.260]  because the whole thing's going next level and the enemy is going next level
[2:14:43.260 --> 2:14:50.780]  and so i've been holding back because again i'm i'm dialed in and uh and i can just like
[2:14:50.780 --> 2:14:55.420]  that it's like wow i mean like the i mean it's like a storm that hadn't got there yet you see
[2:14:55.420 --> 2:14:59.180]  it blowing in across the water then you start seeing the trees start moving and when it's actually
[2:14:59.180 --> 2:15:03.980]  there you know the windows are breaking it's like man i know what's coming and it's not me folks
[2:15:03.980 --> 2:15:11.260]  it's it's all of us it's big because the enemy is going ahead with it that's really what i wanted
[2:15:11.260 --> 2:15:15.260]  to say and then i thought about what am i going to do coming into break and and what have i been
[2:15:15.260 --> 2:15:23.740]  feeling the last few months and weeks and it's that trump can't fix this himself and us getting mad
[2:15:23.740 --> 2:15:30.780]  at trump and saying it's his fault or wishing he'd do better is is is a cop out it's us and
[2:15:32.860 --> 2:15:36.460]  what's gonna happen is gonna happen but there's a version where things are light
[2:15:36.460 --> 2:15:42.060]  but we still go through a lot because we need to be punished and and get back to reality
[2:15:43.180 --> 2:15:46.620]  and there's other versions there's a lot of different versions of this reality
[2:15:46.620 --> 2:15:51.020]  and there's one down here if we don't act now and really take action that's what people call
[2:15:51.020 --> 2:15:56.780]  and they say you got a lot of courage are you kidding me i got a lot of courage if somebody's
[2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:01.020]  trying to drop me out of the helicopter into a volcano trying to hold on to the helicopter
[2:16:01.020 --> 2:16:04.460]  tell me a lot of courage you're fighting hard i'm like fighting dudes on a helicopter trying
[2:16:04.460 --> 2:16:08.540]  to throw me out like damn you're beating some people's ass man you got a lot of courage they're
[2:16:08.540 --> 2:16:14.780]  trying to throw me out of the damn helicopter into a lava that ain't courage that's me holding
[2:16:14.780 --> 2:16:20.860]  off of my fingernails people you think this is some kind of game you think these people are playing
[2:16:20.860 --> 2:16:28.540]  games bill gates wants to kill you he said he wants to kill you he's out the open
[2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:36.300]  so we should be having a discussion about people that are going to die in these trials
[2:16:37.020 --> 2:16:40.140]  people that get sick in the trials these vaccines now he's a murderer
[2:16:40.940 --> 2:16:45.500]  and how we sit there and let his whole system murder people and then he's not held responsible
[2:16:46.620 --> 2:16:47.580]  i'm not the one
[2:16:51.500 --> 2:16:56.700]  whose job it is to decide who lives and who dies and he's telling you he's deciding who's living
[2:16:56.700 --> 2:17:06.060]  and dying and i tell bill gates who i know is a slave of satan that you serve a god that's
[2:17:06.060 --> 2:17:10.220]  already been defeated and there's no god because you can't reason with bill gates you can't make
[2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:17.500]  him back down you can't make him stop because all he is a big stinking rotting tentacle hanging out
[2:17:17.500 --> 2:17:25.340]  of satan's ass like a hemorrhoid so don't try to talk to bill gates don't try to reason with him
[2:17:25.340 --> 2:17:33.100]  because all he knows is carrying out that mission to poison you and kill you slowly and suck everything
[2:17:33.100 --> 2:17:42.140]  out of you he runs monsanto he runs it everything that's the little demon oh he's a front man
[2:17:42.140 --> 2:17:47.500]  oh he's a you know he acts so evil and giggles about killing people he's not a high level one
[2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:55.580]  no the high level one's hit it before now they're showing you who they are we're in a new phase and
[2:17:55.580 --> 2:18:02.300]  if you can let a demonic elf sit there and tell you how he wants you dead but oh he sure loves you
[2:18:02.300 --> 2:18:07.020]  he sure got a shot for you he's telling you what he's gonna do to you
[2:18:07.020 --> 2:18:16.940]  so here's what i'm trying to get at right now
[2:18:22.940 --> 2:18:28.780]  i don't say this to demoralize you or to make you feel scared or to make you think to give up
[2:18:28.780 --> 2:18:34.940]  it's the opposite but i can tell you that trump is not in control of almost all these countries
[2:18:34.940 --> 2:18:39.420]  he's not in control of the un he's trying to get out of it he understands the problem now
[2:18:39.420 --> 2:18:44.540]  he's not in control of the federal government completely he can't stop it it's all the corporations
[2:18:44.540 --> 2:18:50.380]  it's all the big banks it's the big money it's the eu it's the communist chinese it's evil in all our
[2:18:50.380 --> 2:18:55.900]  hearts it's the hollywood class it's the satanist it's the occultists it's the deceivers that have
[2:18:55.900 --> 2:18:59.500]  been betting on evil because they believe they're gonna get all this power and they believe they're
[2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:07.340]  gonna get this life extension and they are delusional they are cursed they have psychic viruses in
[2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:14.460]  their brain and their soul and so they're gone and they do one thing and that's destroy civilization
[2:19:14.460 --> 2:19:22.060]  and it's spreading and so i just want everybody to know you're not fixing this and we're gonna go
[2:19:22.060 --> 2:19:28.940]  downhill because god's lifted the hedge of protection and the men at the hedge of protection
[2:19:28.940 --> 2:19:36.220]  is lifted the enemy comes in because that's what it does and it's a law of the universe man you can't
[2:19:36.780 --> 2:19:42.300]  kill third world people you can't enslave people you can't live off slaves you can't kill babies
[2:19:42.300 --> 2:19:48.140]  you can't devil worship you can't be lazy you can't be stupid and then not have the psychic vampires
[2:19:48.140 --> 2:19:54.140]  the psychic wolves come in and destroy you they will do it it's blood in the water we have been
[2:19:54.140 --> 2:19:58.140]  dumping the blood of the innocents into the psychic water of the universe we have been human
[2:19:58.140 --> 2:20:03.340]  sacrificing and devil worshiping and hurting ourselves and taking all these drugs and we're
[2:20:03.340 --> 2:20:10.140]  done we're gonna be absolutely tortured and brutalized and no one's gonna care because they're
[2:20:10.140 --> 2:20:14.860]  all satanic they'll be getting torn apart you'll be getting torn apart and it's just it's just
[2:20:14.860 --> 2:20:23.100]  stampeding mass mental illness and delusion and just crashing civilizations and up at the top weird
[2:20:23.100 --> 2:20:29.900]  crazy women just dancing on the death of everything because satan wants that image of women leading
[2:20:29.900 --> 2:20:33.900]  the earth into death and they're gonna kill most the earth they're gonna kill all the animals all
[2:20:33.900 --> 2:20:38.780]  the species and then celebrate it they're the one and then say that humans did it when the satanists
[2:20:38.780 --> 2:20:57.420]  did it mass death mass evil get ready it's time the answer to 1984 is 1776

[2:21:53.740 --> 2:22:00.220]  Yale on 15 ways to brainwash the public into taking inoculations basically squeezing you
[2:22:00.220 --> 2:22:05.500]  and forcing you to take them through guilt through fines through not being able to go into stores

[2:22:50.700 --> 2:22:55.260]  in the last year i've pointed out statements out of the council on foreign relations and other
[2:22:55.260 --> 2:23:01.100]  globalist organs that they know trump is going to win in a landslide so their strategy will be
[2:23:01.100 --> 2:23:07.740]  to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it then they are openly now wargaming this
[2:23:07.740 --> 2:23:13.420]  is in the new york times having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've
[2:23:13.420 --> 2:23:18.780]  ignored crumbs policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down that is nothing but a
[2:23:18.780 --> 2:23:23.900]  dress rehearsal they are saying they're gonna have their own separate inauguration not in dc they
[2:23:23.900 --> 2:23:30.860]  said in another city Pelosi has said this when they crown biden and kamala harris ladies and

[2:24:23.900 --> 2:24:27.500]  again if you're a new listener and you hear me tuning in saying there's a world government
[2:24:27.500 --> 2:24:33.580]  with off-world entities that wants to set up a plan to exterminate us it's mainline science
[2:24:34.540 --> 2:24:39.420]  that the big ceo's believe we're in a simulation and that aliens created us and that they're building
[2:24:39.420 --> 2:24:43.820]  a world government to set up a super technology to break free that they believe that some entity
[2:24:43.820 --> 2:24:51.580]  has enslaved us on this planet i mean it's all right out of the bible and people could say well
[2:24:51.580 --> 2:24:57.340]  is this some larger deception where you know the actual god did this as a sadist that's what the
[2:24:57.340 --> 2:25:03.180]  satanists always say is oh your god's a sadist your god set this up and allowed this no god gave
[2:25:03.180 --> 2:25:09.980]  us free will because we're new entities with the potential of god in the millennium not that we're
[2:25:09.980 --> 2:25:18.540]  god we're made little g image of god but it's a process to even be able to interface with god
[2:25:19.820 --> 2:25:25.580]  and if you're god the only thing you can do that's new is to create new entities that actually have
[2:25:25.580 --> 2:25:33.500]  free will and the potential to create whole new universes whole new realities and if you look at
[2:25:34.380 --> 2:25:39.340]  the secret oprah wimpery the satanists all know that's god's plan they want it now
[2:25:41.580 --> 2:25:45.900]  but notice they want to do it at the expense of everybody else's free will we have to submit to
[2:25:45.900 --> 2:25:51.500]  them we have to behave the way they want us to and then they'll build this utopia but you look at a
[2:25:51.500 --> 2:26:00.860]  picture of congresswoman presley and aoc and just look at the satanic look on their face look at the
[2:26:00.860 --> 2:26:10.860]  fake smiling look at all of it look at joe biden these are all slaves these are all jokes and
[2:26:10.860 --> 2:26:17.660]  they've been told make war against reality make war against all that's good and you will be the king
[2:26:17.660 --> 2:26:22.860]  of the universe but obviously it's not helping them it's not helping their constituents they're
[2:26:22.860 --> 2:26:26.780]  destroying themselves because they're following a program that's not of this world
[2:26:30.940 --> 2:26:35.980]  that's why everything they do is about looking as alien and weird and creepy as they can because
[2:26:35.980 --> 2:26:42.380]  these are monsters folks steve bannon you know gets the populism of the world can't be trusted but
[2:26:42.380 --> 2:26:48.380]  democrats want destruction of american way of life no they want destruction of humanity always see
[2:26:48.380 --> 2:26:54.780]  tucker carlson saying the democrats hate trump more than they love america and i've said on air
[2:26:54.780 --> 2:27:00.620]  and i've said to tucker hey why don't you and everybody stop saying they hate trump more than
[2:27:00.620 --> 2:27:06.620]  love america they hate america they hate everything it stands for not that we're perfect but what it
[2:27:06.620 --> 2:27:11.740]  stands for and notice you don't hear republicans now saying that that line they hate trump more than
[2:27:11.740 --> 2:27:20.140]  love america these people don't want the country to exist so stop judging them the way you operate
[2:27:21.820 --> 2:27:28.460]  you know you eat too much ice cream you feel bad um it's the middle of the night you piss on the
[2:27:28.460 --> 2:27:33.020]  toilet seat you don't wipe it up i'll let my wife do it she doesn't work i'll let her clean my piss
[2:27:33.020 --> 2:27:40.060]  up you know i mean literally that's the kind of stuff that i at 2am oh god i miss the toilet
[2:27:40.060 --> 2:27:45.500]  i'm gonna let my wife you know that that's alex jones guilt level stuff is i pissed on the side
[2:27:45.500 --> 2:27:52.540]  of the toilet a little squirt the globalists aren't just not in the guilt they want to go
[2:27:52.540 --> 2:27:58.940]  rape a baby they want to go and push that limit and do something really horrible because they like
[2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:06.860]  the feeling of god pulling away from them they like that sensation of horror not me i don't even
[2:28:06.860 --> 2:28:13.980]  want to do bad things oh yeah look at steven cobert let everybody know who he is with pedestrian
[2:28:15.900 --> 2:28:19.500]  flashing a full-on satan face and so are the rest of them
[2:28:21.820 --> 2:28:24.780]  and you get around these people man let me tell you something i was never a devil
[2:28:24.780 --> 2:28:29.420]  worshipper i got roped into a couple times you're getting brought to the real deal like
[2:28:29.420 --> 2:28:33.740]  eyes wide shut stuff i mean it wasn't quite a castle but it was close the other time it was
[2:28:33.740 --> 2:28:42.300]  outdoors in the big deal real and let me tell you they're wearing mask and hoods for a good reason
[2:28:42.300 --> 2:28:46.700]  put colbert back on that was a good job pulling that photo up stelter i think stelter makes that
[2:28:46.700 --> 2:28:51.020]  face because that's that let me tell you something when you're a kid strapped down a two-year-old
[2:28:51.020 --> 2:28:56.060]  grab with somebody's yard and you're in a basement let me tell you when the door opens up buddy boy
[2:28:56.060 --> 2:29:05.900]  that's what you don't see you see that look right there and it's bad in fact most satanists
[2:29:05.900 --> 2:29:11.660]  don't even like to get possessed and they don't even make that face that face is called the joker
[2:29:11.660 --> 2:29:21.260]  ladies and gentlemen because when people start making those faces in satanic rituals
[2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:28.540]  while they wear mask they start stabbing each other and things because that demon wants one
[2:29:28.540 --> 2:29:37.180]  thing and has to kill humans and there it is you see that look they're all into themselves all into
[2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:47.340]  the emptiness all into the fake glow of satanism it's sick and it's evil and it's empty and it's
[2:29:47.340 --> 2:29:52.940]  a job and that's it it's the charlie manson stare folks
[2:29:56.460 --> 2:29:58.380]  and that's who they are children of the devil
[2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:04.620]  living for the devil ain't doing too good for them you know people look at me and they say
[2:30:04.620 --> 2:30:11.100]  you know jones looks old he's 46 like he's 55 yeah that's right because i take the weight on my
[2:30:11.100 --> 2:30:17.820]  shoulders and i'm not afraid of losing my body and i do things in my body i shouldn't have done but
[2:30:17.820 --> 2:30:26.860]  i don't serve the devil i may look like fred flintstone but don't i look alive when i look
[2:30:26.860 --> 2:30:30.540]  like i got blood coursing through my veins and i'm tied into something good yeah
[2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:38.060]  a lot of a lot of wear on these tires but i like all the scratches and cuts and dents it makes me
[2:30:38.060 --> 2:30:41.980]  who i am but then let's look at those people put them back on screen you couldn't pay me
[2:30:43.660 --> 2:30:47.580]  yeah i was reading about how kamala harris put a guy in jail when they had the dna test
[2:30:47.580 --> 2:30:51.180]  to do he was innocent he didn't have a criminal he was a good guy they put in jail it's one thing
[2:30:51.180 --> 2:30:55.580]  if somebody's already had like five rapes and a murder and they're out of jail for 20 you know
[2:30:55.580 --> 2:30:59.980]  after 20 years and you're not sure you don't frame them but the evidence looks like they did it okay
[2:30:59.980 --> 2:31:05.580]  send them back to prison that's bad enough but imagine knowing somebody's totally innocent
[2:31:05.580 --> 2:31:11.500]  and keeping them in jail for 18 years till the killer actually got found separately by people
[2:31:11.500 --> 2:31:17.660]  that weren't corrupt like her and then the guy got paid 18 million dollars a million dollars for each
[2:31:17.660 --> 2:31:25.580]  year you couldn't pay me a billion dollars to stay in some jail oh he shouldn't get 18 million
[2:31:25.580 --> 2:31:32.220]  dollars it's all a big sick joke so if you're a radio listener you know you really got a good
[2:31:32.220 --> 2:31:41.260]  thing happening for you don't need to look at the left but can you imagine walking around in the halls
[2:31:41.260 --> 2:31:52.700]  of those places now in the year 2020 they're making satanic faces that satanist 30 years ago 35 years
[2:31:52.700 --> 2:31:59.180]  ago won't even make themselves because see satanists want to be in control of the demons
[2:31:59.180 --> 2:32:07.580]  they don't want to be run by them but see it's a whole new game plan now ain't it
[2:32:09.340 --> 2:32:14.060]  and that's why they walk around in congress i've been there and i've seen it and they walk up to
[2:32:14.060 --> 2:32:20.300]  each other go like in all the movies of a supervillain why does the supervillain have a big evil
[2:32:20.300 --> 2:32:25.980]  smile on their face and cackle and laugh because they're turned over to evil they're dialed into that
[2:32:25.980 --> 2:32:37.500]  channel and they can't stop it governor Newsom loves all the suicides and crime everybody
[2:32:37.500 --> 2:32:42.860]  moving out he loves he's bringing down the whole country that's his job he's a military officer
[2:32:42.860 --> 2:32:47.980]  and of course his wineries are the only ones with restaurants all over the state back by
[2:32:47.980 --> 2:32:52.780]  Nancy Pelosi money makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year profit his stay oh people go
[2:32:52.780 --> 2:32:58.460]  a lot of years he goes they do stay open you know well that's evil it's about rubbing it in
[2:32:58.460 --> 2:33:07.900]  and laughing and cackling at you it's about teaching you to submit to them the uk is not
[2:33:07.900 --> 2:33:11.900]  becoming a police state it is one where there's no speech nothing it's all collapsing europe
[2:33:11.900 --> 2:33:21.420]  same thing and now here yippee-ki-yay let's go to break i'll come back it's important as
[2:33:21.420 --> 2:33:30.060]  big brains put something special together for us stay with us
[2:33:41.740 --> 2:33:48.460]  Nancy Pelosi Eric Holder Joe Biden Hillary Clinton and the list goes on from there
[2:33:48.460 --> 2:33:53.020]  have all gone on national tv have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages of the
[2:33:53.020 --> 2:33:58.940]  new york times that their war came in contesting the election when they lose they know there's a
[2:33:58.940 --> 2:34:04.700]  landslide if they're unable to steal it they're planning to contest it and have democrat blue
[2:34:04.700 --> 2:34:10.300]  states secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public
[2:34:10.300 --> 2:34:16.700]  Kamala Harris this has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover
[2:34:16.700 --> 2:34:22.380]  to try to drive trump from office the democratic party the chai comms the deep state are using
[2:34:22.380 --> 2:34:28.460]  black lives matter funded by soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at
[2:34:28.460 --> 2:34:33.580]  creating artificial riots and martial law that you're racist when in truth an old
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:39.260]  nazi collaborator george soros created black lives matter along with antifa america's fighting
[2:34:39.260 --> 2:34:47.260]  for its life but we will win you can really break civilizations down to two types predatory and
[2:34:47.260 --> 2:34:53.500]  non predatory or oppressive conquest based or renaissance based and of course different types
[2:34:53.500 --> 2:34:59.580]  of civilizations and countries and political systems of history and at the present are mixes of the
[2:34:59.580 --> 2:35:09.660]  two but with globalism it is a post human ideology so it's scientifically geared to be oppressive
[2:35:10.380 --> 2:35:15.740]  and the rationale is social Darwinism that the ruling class are elites and because they're in
[2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:23.020]  power they have a right to rule over you poison you dumb you down sterilize you and kill you so all
[2:35:23.020 --> 2:35:28.380]  the people wearing masks like outside at the park and stuff are living in a total hoax and think
[2:35:28.380 --> 2:35:34.700]  their active submission is an active working for the common good in a collective no it's a sign
[2:35:34.700 --> 2:35:39.100]  that you're a slave who will take the force inoculations federal government and Yale are
[2:35:39.100 --> 2:35:46.540]  studying the force inoculations right now incrementalism the inchworm effect successive
[2:35:46.540 --> 2:35:52.460]  approximation first they tell you only stay in your house for 15 days so the hospitals can stay
[2:35:52.460 --> 2:35:58.620]  empty that was all a fraud then wear a mask for a month here we are six months later then they start
[2:35:58.620 --> 2:36:05.100]  making people at colleges and at big corporations where wristbands showing that they've been quote
[2:36:05.100 --> 2:36:11.420]  contact traced and tested for covid then comes the apps on your phones and the global social credit
[2:36:11.420 --> 2:36:17.580]  score now being rolled out by virginia california and others it's not coming it's here and then the
[2:36:17.580 --> 2:36:23.420]  inoculations if you ever want to leave your house which amounts to force inoculations this is the
[2:36:23.420 --> 2:36:28.300]  medical tyranny takeover these are not classic vaccines that have their own problems these are
[2:36:28.300 --> 2:36:35.420]  dna vaccines that change your dna and are having massive serious side effects guaranteed this is
[2:36:35.420 --> 2:36:41.660]  about depopulation bill gates admits that this is an emergency resist or die the new world order is
[2:36:41.660 --> 2:36:46.220]  here i'm going to say something right now that is one of the most important things i've ever said
[2:36:46.220 --> 2:36:53.340]  so please listen very very carefully donald trump is not the reason they released covid or had the
[2:36:53.340 --> 2:37:00.380]  lockdown they already had this plan the rockefeller foundation and billa melinda gates it is beyond
[2:37:00.380 --> 2:37:04.140]  critical it is life and death for you and your family to understand no matter where you live on
[2:37:04.140 --> 2:37:11.580]  the planet but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end
[2:37:11.580 --> 2:37:16.700]  again the united nations has admitted that first it's a month then it's six months then they say
[2:37:16.700 --> 2:37:22.220]  okay it's two years they're now saying two years they're now saying you'll never go back to normal
[2:37:23.260 --> 2:37:28.780]  no more gatherings no more anything constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work
[2:37:29.740 --> 2:37:36.140]  in the way they say they work they change your dna this is the culling of the planet this is the
[2:37:36.140 --> 2:37:40.940]  beginning of the straitjacket being put on you before you're slowly towards your death and kill
[2:37:40.940 --> 2:37:48.380]  do you understand you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:56.940 --> 2:38:05.980]  back about 18 and 25 i left tennessee very much alive i never would have made it through the
[2:38:05.980 --> 2:38:11.420]  arkansas mud if i hadn't been riding on the tennessee stud
[2:38:14.300 --> 2:38:19.740]  had some trouble with my sweethearts paw one of her brothers was a bad outlaw
[2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:27.500]  i rolled a letter to my uncle foot and i rolled away on the tennessee stud
[2:38:27.500 --> 2:38:35.980]  the tennessee stud was long and lean the color of the sun and his eyes were green
[2:38:36.940 --> 2:38:41.980]  all right he had the nerve and he had the blood let's get into it
[2:38:45.180 --> 2:38:48.780]  they never intended in the lockdown they said they would never end if they wore game at all
[2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:50.860]  and so you got to tell your friends your family your neighbors
[2:38:50.860 --> 2:38:56.780]  constantly what the plan is and the compliance is death
[2:38:58.540 --> 2:39:04.060]  you know i remember reading seamans and google documents that were public over 10 years ago
[2:39:04.060 --> 2:39:10.460]  about how in the future all cars will be driverless and how they would just phase in the driverless
[2:39:10.460 --> 2:39:14.700]  features for safety at first wherever you go out of the lane it takes back control
[2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:18.460]  now all the chevys have that and pretty soon you know it knows when you're on your phone it
[2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:23.020]  won't just have you say hey i'm not driving and then let you be on the phone it'll have to face
[2:39:23.020 --> 2:39:27.260]  print that you're not driving and then if you are it's okay it'll just take control it's all
[2:39:27.260 --> 2:39:33.500]  surveilling you and oh sounds like it's good it's an anti-state but they admit the next move is
[2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:39.980]  they're going to put gates and bridges up that block the roads and the public's going to accept
[2:39:39.980 --> 2:39:46.380]  that because the riots and the societal collapse that they're bringing in now for the next five years
[2:39:46.380 --> 2:39:51.900]  are going to be so bad that we're going to finally accept well you don't go outdoors unless
[2:39:51.900 --> 2:39:57.820]  they say to stop the riots plus the covid we're already all used to it this is a permanent
[2:39:57.820 --> 2:40:06.140]  martial law scenario and now there's this huge article up on info wars dot com and i should
[2:40:06.140 --> 2:40:11.820]  have just led the whole show with from town hall dot com fits in everything we've warned you about
[2:40:11.820 --> 2:40:16.780]  maxine waters congress can remove trump without impeachment we're going to cover this in a moment
[2:40:18.060 --> 2:40:22.220]  now i told you get ready for them to start saying we don't need impeachment to remove him
[2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:27.580]  what did brennan clappers say three years ago we're going to remove him without impeachment
[2:40:30.300 --> 2:40:35.100]  now of course that's not just martial law that's not just civil war
[2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:41.660]  war that is actual trees
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:48.620]  let's see the the psych warfare chiefs running this you're in a lockdown you're in a race riot
[2:40:48.620 --> 2:40:52.860]  you see people shooting people at checkpoints they're the good guys the people that fight back
[2:40:52.860 --> 2:41:01.660]  are the bad guys and now if i get the video of this she came out and said this look at all
[2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:06.060]  this is a paragraph for paragraph this crap i'll have to take 15 minutes to the next hour of
[2:41:06.060 --> 2:41:15.180]  salinity i know i'm doing a interview at 230 but i'm gonna have to just i'm gonna have to cover
[2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:19.500]  this but see how it works is you've heard me say it so much and you've kind of heard them say it
[2:41:19.500 --> 2:41:24.540]  so much now it's going all right well they're gonna i mean obviously the big story is the post
[2:41:24.540 --> 2:41:36.540]  office they go we want 25 billion extra after obama defunded it we want 25 billion extra
[2:41:36.540 --> 2:41:42.140]  so we can pay off the postal service to take all these stuffed ballots and fake ballots
[2:41:42.140 --> 2:41:48.780]  and do all this crap it's totally illegal but chuck schumer all them turning around and go
[2:41:48.780 --> 2:41:55.260]  trumps violate in the vote he doesn't want you to have your mail in ballot which in michigan and
[2:41:55.260 --> 2:42:03.180]  california and all over their finding is like i saw one report a third of them are dead people
[2:42:03.180 --> 2:42:08.700]  they're mailing it in they're caught who do you think's filling out the names of dead people
[2:42:11.100 --> 2:42:16.780]  they're sending them to every democrat household knowing full well that they're gonna put grandma
[2:42:16.780 --> 2:42:23.180]  on there who died five years ago and they're now saying they're not even gonna check the voter
[2:42:23.180 --> 2:42:27.180]  rolls in most states if a name comes through they're just gonna say it was a vote
[2:42:34.140 --> 2:42:37.020]  oh but fouchy says we can vote in person isn't he nice
[2:42:37.020 --> 2:42:46.380]  oh fouchy said fouchy said i could have another shot that'll keep me safe i mean
[2:42:48.220 --> 2:42:49.820]  he's the guy that told us what we can do
[2:42:55.500 --> 2:42:58.460]  but we have to keep our spirits up and we just have to get the word out
[2:42:59.100 --> 2:43:03.820]  but at the same time i you know i just say what i know is true
[2:43:03.820 --> 2:43:09.820]  and i've analyzed this thing up one side and down the other i know you have to
[2:43:10.380 --> 2:43:20.140]  and i didn't get up here five six months ago and say a collapse of the first world will
[2:43:21.100 --> 2:43:25.740]  kill the third world because i wanted to be shocking i looked at the numbers
[2:43:28.220 --> 2:43:31.660]  five billion people roughly of the seven and a half billion on this planet
[2:43:31.660 --> 2:43:36.620]  spend more than half of their paycheck of the money they get on food
[2:43:37.980 --> 2:43:41.820]  and there's actuaries that when you start spending a more than a 30 year money on food it means you're
[2:43:41.820 --> 2:43:47.420]  in a precarious situation when you're spending over half on your food it means you're in a very
[2:43:47.420 --> 2:43:54.700]  dangerous situation all they got to do with those five billion people is shut down the western economy
[2:43:54.700 --> 2:44:03.020]  for about five months they've already done it folks and then the chain reaction will catty
[2:44:03.020 --> 2:44:06.780]  want us all the supply chains out of the first world in the third world because we're getting
[2:44:06.780 --> 2:44:12.540]  the supply from them and then we're sending back money and and other infrastructure and it's death
[2:44:12.540 --> 2:44:18.140]  sense and i don't sit here talking about how i care about these third world people like i'm some
[2:44:18.140 --> 2:44:25.260]  goody two shoe i care about myself and i know that we're next and i feel bad for them too man i mean i
[2:44:27.180 --> 2:44:34.460]  i'm getting chills right now in that i'm not getting chills before when i was talking about
[2:44:34.460 --> 2:44:38.060]  all these people and i was just saying it without really feeling anything because i'm getting so
[2:44:38.060 --> 2:44:41.420]  comfortable with it because that's how it works even though i don't want to do it i'm getting
[2:44:41.420 --> 2:44:45.660]  comfortable with it because i my mind's already made friends with it because i want to deal with
[2:44:45.660 --> 2:44:49.900]  i want to overcome it but there's a sick level where if you overcome it by just accepting it you've
[2:44:49.900 --> 2:44:55.500]  not overcome it you submit to it so then i thought about that i got that big chill not the good chill
[2:44:55.500 --> 2:45:01.820]  the one the godfarin chill where you get the little directive that yeah you don't even think about
[2:45:01.820 --> 2:45:07.900]  not caring because see one part of me is like trying to get used to it just screw these people god
[2:45:07.900 --> 2:45:12.300]  bill gates gonna kill them all jesus you know i mean you know and i'm just trying to work my
[2:45:12.300 --> 2:45:19.500]  brain around this man because here's the thing you know what a lot of my cells are saying i know
[2:45:19.500 --> 2:45:23.900]  what your cells are saying too the people killing everybody they're the ones that need to be brought
[2:45:23.900 --> 2:45:31.420]  to justice and i don't talk about killing lightly but i just think we should all pray
[2:45:33.020 --> 2:45:38.220]  that all these new world order people be brought to justice by god and god will answer back and say
[2:45:38.220 --> 2:45:44.220]  are you protesting outside the abortion clinics are you standing up against the genetic engineering
[2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:54.780]  are you humbling yourself are you protesting are you involved are you gonna god wants to see us
[2:45:54.780 --> 2:46:00.300]  put god first god wants to see us turn off the netflix put down the whiskey bottle i'm talking to
[2:46:00.300 --> 2:46:06.780]  myself and to everybody else and god wants to see us go out there god wants god wants to see you
[2:46:06.780 --> 2:46:11.500]  arrested for freedom god wants to see you go through some fire
[2:46:15.340 --> 2:46:23.660]  before god starts doing what we want if a billion people turned away from satan and prayed today
[2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:28.300]  that the head of this whole covet hoax be struck dead he'd be dead by midnight
[2:46:29.660 --> 2:46:34.540]  if a billion people repented in their heart and god knew it was real because god can see if it's
[2:46:34.540 --> 2:46:38.060]  real and god already knows what you're going to do once you make the decision if you have that decision
[2:46:39.980 --> 2:46:41.820]  then we'd be delivered today
[2:46:45.580 --> 2:46:50.860]  but god's not going to deliver somebody that didn't want to be delivered that's why when
[2:46:50.860 --> 2:46:55.020]  they're leaving satan and gamora and the and the wife looks back that says don't look back
[2:46:56.460 --> 2:46:58.300]  and she gets frozen into a pillar of salt
[2:46:58.300 --> 2:47:06.940]  because she didn't want to leave it you've got to revolt it you've got to hate it you've
[2:47:06.940 --> 2:47:13.180]  got to turn it loose you've got to really not want it and if you don't want the new world order
[2:47:13.180 --> 2:47:16.620]  if it revolts you and you want to wait from it you're not scared of it and you don't care what
[2:47:16.620 --> 2:47:21.260]  happens to you you're in god's presence but if you're worried about what people think
[2:47:21.260 --> 2:47:27.500]  if you're worried about the world then they got you and you're looking back at it
[2:47:28.140 --> 2:47:32.380]  see you might as well just go down there because let me tell you it's all gonna burn
[2:47:40.540 --> 2:47:44.620]  we fund our operations selling products we got a big sale going right now at infowarstore.com

[2:48:32.380 --> 2:48:37.740]  six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now democrat leaders are calling for people to be
[2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:42.060]  charged for the attempted murder they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery and they've
[2:48:42.060 --> 2:48:47.340]  triggered their race riots around the country led by white angry liberal academics and others
[2:48:47.340 --> 2:48:51.980]  and now on top of the democrats are officially saying hey trump's gonna try to steal the election
[2:48:51.980 --> 2:48:57.340]  and contest it but then their internal war gaming documents come out with john pades at the very top
[2:48:57.340 --> 2:49:02.300]  with kamala harris and of course joe biden and they're saying oh we think we're gonna lose
[2:49:02.300 --> 2:49:07.180]  but we're gonna have the democrat state secede claiming that joe biden's won the popular vote
[2:49:07.180 --> 2:49:11.980]  and we are then going to set up our own country and ask the military to remove trump this
[2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:16.140]  is officially in the new york times don't just believe the new york times i've been telling you
[2:49:16.140 --> 2:49:21.020]  for over a year this is their plan from other statements they've made an Atlantic monthly
[2:49:21.020 --> 2:49:25.420]  the washington post the financial times of london and the council on farm relations this is their
[2:49:25.420 --> 2:49:30.140]  plan we've got 80 days left to stop it what are you going to do i'm serious folks this is the time
[2:49:30.140 --> 2:49:37.260]  to save the country just a few months ago almost every storeable food manufacturer was sold out
[2:49:37.260 --> 2:49:41.100]  they were still taking people's orders and many of the companies have still not fulfilled them
[2:49:41.100 --> 2:49:45.340]  all the orders we got in have been fulfilled our suppliers the best the highest quality the best
[2:49:45.340 --> 2:49:49.900]  containers to transport it as well and they've got the food with four factories in stock take
[2:49:49.900 --> 2:49:54.460]  some two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you you need to order your storeable food now
[2:49:54.460 --> 2:49:59.100]  the world is much more dire the economic system is collapsing the third world's already starving
[2:49:59.100 --> 2:50:04.620]  to death food prices are exploding here uh the farms and the production plants are shutting down
[2:50:04.620 --> 2:50:08.380]  because of the covid hoax you need to get your storeable food while you still can and in full

[2:50:30.940 --> 2:50:38.460]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:50.220 --> 2:50:55.980]  then in trump this week again fueling this false this racist birther conspiracy theory about
[2:50:55.980 --> 2:51:01.660]  senator harris what do you make of the president going back to you know this sort of old movie
[2:51:01.660 --> 2:51:05.180]  we've already seen before from this president with a new character now and senator harris
[2:51:06.540 --> 2:51:13.740]  the president of the united states of america is unbelievably divisive uh the president lies
[2:51:14.300 --> 2:51:19.420]  he's pitting people against each other going back to the over the argument that they attempted to
[2:51:19.420 --> 2:51:26.860]  use against obama this is a president uh that is the most deplorable human being uh that i've ever
[2:51:26.860 --> 2:51:33.980]  encountered in my life and he's undermining our democracy we cannot take any more of this president
[2:51:33.980 --> 2:51:41.900]  this president is not only uh attacking uh the person that was just appointed or selected by
[2:51:41.900 --> 2:51:49.660]  biden to be his vice president and he is not hesitant to do it uh you this man has no shame uh the
[2:51:49.660 --> 2:51:56.380]  name calling he called denacity on and on and on i don't know how much more the american people
[2:51:56.380 --> 2:52:02.940]  can take as a matter of fact when you couple that with what he's doing undermining our democracy
[2:52:02.940 --> 2:52:13.260]  tearing up our post office i believe that it is time for section four of amendment 25 to be put in
[2:52:13.260 --> 2:52:21.980]  place and his cabinet should send to um nazi policy the speaker as i think it's then identified in
[2:52:21.980 --> 2:52:28.060]  the constitution that this man should be removed from office section 25 should be put in place he
[2:52:28.060 --> 2:52:33.740]  is dangerous he is tearing up again you know this country undermining our democracy and i'm
[2:52:33.740 --> 2:52:39.180]  going to tell you something i'm getting more complaints about what he's doing to the post
[2:52:39.180 --> 2:52:46.460]  office than i have on any other issue in my district he cannot have our post office he cannot do this
[2:52:46.460 --> 2:52:54.860]  we've got to stop him wow yeah biden uh did get kamala here she is appointed by the establishment
[2:52:54.860 --> 2:53:00.220]  to be our new president after he steps down a little bit of a slip up um by uh that lady uh you
[2:53:00.220 --> 2:53:06.540]  notice in the newscast they didn't show what trump said they just said have you heard that because both
[2:53:06.540 --> 2:53:10.140]  their parents weren't born here there's some question about where she was born he said no that's
[2:53:10.140 --> 2:53:14.300]  interesting i i haven't seen that i need to look into that like why don't we for next segment
[2:53:14.300 --> 2:53:19.580]  pull up trump on uh kamala harris and the birthing he's like i haven't i just heard that i don't know
[2:53:19.580 --> 2:53:28.700]  i'll look at it that turns an incredibly divisive we whenever his birth or stuff obama was the editor
[2:53:28.700 --> 2:53:35.740]  of the harvard law review for three years and in three of those three years he wrote in the forward
[2:53:35.740 --> 2:53:42.060]  on his bio that he was born in kinya because that sounded trendy and cool of course he was born in
[2:53:42.060 --> 2:53:47.100]  hawaii to frank marshall davis and it's confirmed the head of the communist party in hawaii and a
[2:53:47.100 --> 2:53:53.660]  famous pornographer who shot porno films with his mother in lesbian betty page movies by the way
[2:53:53.660 --> 2:53:59.980]  i've seen the movies not just the photos it's a pretty big pretty hot slut actually i i'm sorry
[2:53:59.980 --> 2:54:06.140]  the point is is that is that is that is that of course they covered that up and then he wrote in
[2:54:06.140 --> 2:54:11.660]  dreams of my father about staying at frank in the summer who was like his real dad and then later
[2:54:11.660 --> 2:54:16.380]  his grandfather would go and hang out frank marshall davis and obama stayed there on the summers
[2:54:16.380 --> 2:54:22.300]  frank marshall davis i frank and i apologize family show is being funny there no i mean it's it's it
[2:54:22.300 --> 2:54:26.860]  i mean i i'm not big into porn and all that stuff but i like the betty page type stuff and
[2:54:28.060 --> 2:54:34.220]  there's a whole collection of porn with his mom and and uh and that was pretty i mean that's how
[2:54:34.220 --> 2:54:39.100]  communists made money though is a ran pornography and see she was a cia sex operative who obviously
[2:54:39.100 --> 2:54:43.100]  infiltrated the communists this is all admitted and his grandfather was in the federal reserve
[2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:49.820]  and all the rest of it i mean obama is hooked up man mother is a sex operative and then they make
[2:54:49.820 --> 2:54:54.780]  the jokes about michelle being a tranny and then john river says no she is a tranny she's got shoulders
[2:54:54.780 --> 2:54:58.940]  bigger than nine and i got big shoulders folks i mean she's got shoulders like an NFL linebacker
[2:54:58.940 --> 2:55:04.140]  and then she walks around was like a role of silver dollars is in her pants uh and then i'm
[2:55:04.140 --> 2:55:11.020]  like okay and then like in his own books he admits he was raised by a transsexual man woman
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:17.180]  and it's it's just in indonesia it's just weirder than hell and they always say
[2:55:17.180 --> 2:55:23.580]  john says michael obama which he keeps calling michael i really love michael he doesn't on purpose
[2:55:25.020 --> 2:55:30.860]  they planted the kenya thing as the cover for frank marshall davis and all those lesbian films he
[2:55:30.860 --> 2:55:37.580]  shot with it with obama's mama there you go there's lebron james right there on screen we'll
[2:55:37.580 --> 2:55:51.420]  right back stay with us you hear that that's the march of the united nations and the billa
[2:55:51.420 --> 2:55:57.900]  melinda gauge foundation coming with their battle plan psychological warfare operation
[2:55:57.900 --> 2:56:04.220]  with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society they're
[2:56:04.220 --> 2:56:09.660]  outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu they're creating artificial phobias for normal
[2:56:09.660 --> 2:56:14.300]  death that takes place they're not even promising to have a cure to it all they're just inflicting
[2:56:15.020 --> 2:56:21.900]  new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the who with vaccines that
[2:56:21.900 --> 2:56:30.780]  actually change your dna and make you owned by microsoft it's a final frontier it's the year 2020
[2:56:30.780 --> 2:56:46.700]  it's not coming it's here and submission is blood in the water
[2:57:01.500 --> 2:57:07.420]  she took my heart away folks if you think globalism is out of control she said i've had a
[2:57:07.420 --> 2:57:13.660]  coming well it's like this song says but i want you ain't seen nothing yet and i'm not trying to
[2:57:13.660 --> 2:57:18.460]  scare you if bad guys are coming for you and your family come over mine i believe in you
[2:57:19.420 --> 2:57:24.060]  and i believe we should make preparation for it we are to here for being honest so hey here it is
[2:57:24.060 --> 2:57:33.340]  we say nothing yet
[2:57:36.060 --> 2:57:36.860]  never gonna forget
[2:57:39.660 --> 2:57:45.020]  actually we forget about a thousand years they let him out again like releasing
[2:57:45.020 --> 2:57:54.300]  superman
[2:58:01.820 --> 2:58:06.860]  all right the story up on info wars dot com and origination of town hall dot com
[2:58:06.860 --> 2:58:15.420]  maxine waters congress can remove trump without impeachment she calls it section 25 it's actually
[2:58:15.420 --> 2:58:24.140]  article 25 and that is the president unfit like woodrow wilson had a stroke and for a year they
[2:58:24.140 --> 2:58:29.100]  kept it secret well no that's not the case so that's why they watched some post headlines
[2:58:29.100 --> 2:58:34.940]  when trump is removed under the 25th amendment anyone that resist will be put in prison well
[2:58:34.940 --> 2:58:40.060]  you have to have the cabinet all agree that that's the case because they all agree the president's
[2:58:40.060 --> 2:58:44.940]  had a stroke or heart attack in his brain dead or you know he's writing on the walls with his
[2:58:44.940 --> 2:58:49.740]  crap or whatever that's not what's happening so she's trying to say we're going to threaten his
[2:58:49.740 --> 2:58:54.220]  cabinet they're going to have enough martial law enough riots and the financial collapse
[2:58:54.220 --> 2:58:58.860]  to blame on trump to say you're all going down throw him overboard and that's the admitted battle
[2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:06.940]  plan and even if he wins the election which i believe he will in a landslide will be enough
[2:59:06.940 --> 2:59:13.020]  to override all the fraud or democrats say they're going to block it and i know again i have hundreds
[2:59:13.020 --> 2:59:19.260]  of articles and dozens of incredible clips but you understand that the lockdown's permanent
[2:59:19.260 --> 2:59:25.180]  it never ends it's about martial law control force inoculations digital currencies everyone
[2:59:25.180 --> 2:59:29.980]  tattling and spying on you when you go around it's the end of everything folks it's an authoritarian
[2:59:29.980 --> 2:59:33.980]  orgy because the megabank stole all the money and are delusional that they're going to merge
[2:59:33.980 --> 2:59:38.220]  the machines and become gods and they've got op-eds everywhere about let's get rid of all humans
[2:59:38.220 --> 2:59:43.420]  covet 19 shows we're obsolete and and people just go what is this it's the cult man
[2:59:46.300 --> 2:59:52.540]  they work with the aliens i don't obsess on flying saucers and you know the the astronauts are at
[2:59:52.540 --> 2:59:59.740]  the moon and something's following them they're not flying around and flying saucers folks they
[2:59:59.740 --> 3:00:05.980]  come through the other dimensions and which are mathematically proven and which the globalists
[3:00:05.980 --> 3:00:12.540]  believe so you could sit there and go jones is crazy if you notice you never see articles
[3:00:12.540 --> 3:00:17.900]  attacking me they go jones says they're slave colonies on mars one million dollar reward
[3:00:17.900 --> 3:00:29.260]  never said it absolutely not true i said they're here with us right now and they're using humans
[3:00:29.260 --> 3:00:33.660]  to build aliens here on earth and the media did make a joke about that five years ago but they
[3:00:33.660 --> 3:00:39.580]  don't joke now the new scientists the wall street journal the new york times all said months after
[3:00:39.580 --> 3:00:48.780]  i did the covet 19 is an alien you understand with genetic engineering
[3:00:51.020 --> 3:00:55.900]  but nanotech that's what these new viruses are they're completely lab made at the molecular level
[3:00:55.900 --> 3:01:00.620]  that we could be sent a radio transmission from alpha centauri's 30 light years away or whatever
[3:01:00.620 --> 3:01:04.860]  it is look up how many light years alpha centauri's as i know it's one of the closest 29 million 33
[3:01:04.860 --> 3:01:13.580]  million i forget we could be sent a transmission from serious the globalists think that's where the
[3:01:13.580 --> 3:01:17.900]  aliens set up the planet come from that's in their cult i'm not saying that i don't know i know god's
[3:01:17.900 --> 3:01:26.620]  real that's what i follow but that stupid movie it's a cheesy movie but it's really accurate
[3:01:26.620 --> 3:01:36.780]  at what the globalists are into species where they alien sin seti the radio telescope with 4367
[3:01:36.780 --> 3:01:42.620]  light years which what's the one that's what's the closest star to earth of my memory it's failing
[3:01:44.860 --> 3:01:47.100]  what's the one that likes to be only take 30 years to get to
[3:01:47.100 --> 3:01:55.420]  anyways let me get back to what i was saying
[3:01:57.580 --> 3:02:01.020]  it's only 4.3 light years so it is the closest okay so
[3:02:04.220 --> 3:02:13.340]  imagine they send us a code on how to build a microorganism and then the thing takes over
[3:02:13.340 --> 3:02:22.380]  why would you take what aliens give you and build it but that's what this is folks
[3:02:23.100 --> 3:02:28.220]  that's what all this is and it's not who we are and it's not good and it's gonna kill us
[3:02:29.340 --> 3:02:33.820]  and the globalists are in the new york times going we believe in transpermia and we're from
[3:02:33.820 --> 3:02:40.300]  aliens none of them believed in atheism none of them none of them and the transmission they're
[3:02:40.300 --> 3:02:47.260]  getting is don't listen to christ become a god give up your body don't it's it's it's we gotta we
[3:02:47.260 --> 3:02:55.740]  got one transmission and the big guy was willing to like literally avatar down here that's what all
[3:02:55.740 --> 3:03:01.900]  this is folks and then these other jerks are just swarming around us and like sharks and other
[3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:07.020]  dimension trying to get cerned to build a weapon to blow a hole in the time space continuum
[3:03:07.020 --> 3:03:12.220]  but they can't get in so they just keep trying to get us to blow the planet up
[3:03:13.260 --> 3:03:16.380]  you're like why because they're losers they're jerks
[3:03:20.060 --> 3:03:23.900]  but i'ma stop getting hypothetical and theoretical here with you let's let's let's let's play what
[3:03:23.900 --> 3:03:31.660]  trump really said about kamala harris and then what um live in america had to say here we go
[3:03:31.660 --> 3:03:38.940]  can you definitively say whether or not kamala harris is eligible to meet the legal requirements
[3:03:38.940 --> 3:03:46.620]  to run as vice president so i just heard that i heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements
[3:03:47.500 --> 3:03:53.260]  and by the way the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified very talented lawyer
[3:03:53.820 --> 3:03:57.740]  i have no idea if that's right i would have i would have assumed the democrats would have
[3:03:57.740 --> 3:04:03.100]  checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president but that's a very serious you're
[3:04:03.100 --> 3:04:07.180]  saying that they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country
[3:04:07.180 --> 3:04:11.980]  no she was born in this country but her parents did not like uh the claims say that her parents
[3:04:11.980 --> 3:04:16.220]  did not receive their permanent residence yeah i don't know about it i just heard about it i'll
[3:04:16.220 --> 3:04:25.020]  take a look so that turns into he should be removed in office and she lies here is uh here is maxi
[3:04:25.020 --> 3:04:31.980]  waters president trump this week again fueling this false this racist birther conspiracy theory
[3:04:31.980 --> 3:04:37.420]  about senator harris what do you make of the president going back to you know this sort of
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:41.340]  old movie we've already seen before from this president with a new character now and senator harris
[3:04:42.780 --> 3:04:49.980]  the president of the united states of america is unbelievably divisive uh the president lies
[3:04:49.980 --> 3:04:55.500]  uh he's pitting people against each other going back to the old bertha argument that they attempted
[3:04:55.500 --> 3:05:02.700]  to use against obama this is a president uh that is the most deplorable human being uh that i've
[3:05:02.700 --> 3:05:09.420]  ever encountered in my life and he's undermining our democracy we cannot take any more of this
[3:05:09.420 --> 3:05:17.820]  president this president is not only uh attacking uh the person that was just appointed or selected
[3:05:17.820 --> 3:05:25.100]  by biden to be his vice president and he is not hesitant to do it uh you this man has no shame
[3:05:25.740 --> 3:05:32.620]  the name calling he called denacity on and on and on i don't know how much more the american people
[3:05:32.620 --> 3:05:39.180]  can take as a matter of fact when you couple that with what he's doing undermining our democracy
[3:05:39.180 --> 3:05:49.260]  tearing up our post office i believe that it is time for section four of amendment 25 to be put
[3:05:49.260 --> 3:05:58.140]  in place and his cabinet should send to um nancy Pelosi the speaker is i think he's been identified
[3:05:58.140 --> 3:06:03.500]  in the constitution that this man should be removed from office section 25 should be put in place
[3:06:03.500 --> 3:06:08.060]  that's enough now the democrats should be removed for being against the existence of the country
[3:06:08.060 --> 3:06:12.780]  chai com operatives who've destroyed every city they've got by design try to bring this country

[3:09:17.100 --> 3:09:25.340]  and no no no great thing on the alex jones show on info wars oh yeah what times we're going through
[3:09:25.340 --> 3:09:34.380]  i want to start off on the economy this thing's going down big time that's unprecedented in
[3:09:34.380 --> 3:09:41.020]  world history i want to get this 100 straight you go back to when they first started closing
[3:09:41.020 --> 3:09:47.980]  things down and all you kept hearing from the exploits they're gonna have a v-shaped economy
[3:09:47.980 --> 3:09:57.100]  it's gonna go down then it's gonna go back up again not happening you look at the data
[3:09:59.020 --> 3:10:03.580]  the only thing that's keeping this up is the money that governments are pumping into the system to
[3:10:03.580 --> 3:10:10.940]  try to prop it up you see where gold prices are going in silver prices oh yeah they took a hit
[3:10:10.940 --> 3:10:22.700]  last week and they bounced back this week look at bitcoin it's now over 12 000 we've been watching this
[3:10:25.660 --> 3:10:33.500]  it's been going as we kept watching it it didn't break below like that 7 000 mark kept going between
[3:10:33.500 --> 3:10:39.980]  six high sixes nines into 10 and we saw when it breaks out past 10 it's going to start moving
[3:10:39.980 --> 3:10:49.900]  really higher the shot past 10 and now it's at 12 why because people know that watch info wars
[3:10:49.900 --> 3:10:59.900]  were subscribed to the transjournal that this is one big fraud they're pumping up global economies
[3:10:59.900 --> 3:11:05.420]  with digital money backed by nothing and printed on nothing these are the hard facts
[3:11:05.420 --> 3:11:14.300]  you're looking at a debt in the united states this year of about four trillion dollars just this year
[3:11:17.580 --> 3:11:24.300]  the dollar's going down oh and the euro's going up oh yeah great why was the euro going up
[3:11:25.100 --> 3:11:32.380]  maybe because they locked down spain again oh in italy you can't go to disco no more clubs
[3:11:32.380 --> 3:11:35.820]  gotta wear a mask can't do this can't do that
[3:11:38.780 --> 3:11:46.460]  hey if you're coming back into uh uh italy and you came from spain or

[3:13:02.540 --> 3:13:17.580]  Manhattan is dead dead the trends journal in early march we said people would be fleeing
[3:13:17.580 --> 3:13:25.900]  major cities because the rising crime and the fear and hysteria that they're promoting
[3:13:25.900 --> 3:13:35.660]  that's going to keep them out of big cities go to new york times last week you know one
[3:13:35.660 --> 3:13:43.100]  of the big stories was you know where they're coming to kingston new york where we are
[3:13:45.420 --> 3:13:50.300]  does that make me happy because i have real estate here and i have three of the most historic

[3:17:41.580 --> 3:17:46.460]  bet is they constantly talk about it in their own words that you will adapt to being a slave
[3:17:46.460 --> 3:17:51.980]  that you will learn incrementally to submit so think about and remember the phases of the
[3:17:51.980 --> 3:17:57.660]  fouchy fraud remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie they lied about
[3:17:57.660 --> 3:18:02.700]  where it came from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up then exaggerated
[3:18:02.700 --> 3:18:11.260]  the death rate at 4% but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping then they set the test up to count
[3:18:11.260 --> 3:18:16.140]  almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other diseases in the covet
[3:18:16.140 --> 3:18:21.020]  column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now we're six months later now they say it's
[3:18:21.020 --> 3:18:24.940]  permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're
[3:18:24.940 --> 3:18:29.020]  going to track everywhere you go and what you do the global social credit score and the un is the

[3:18:34.140 --> 3:18:39.100]  tyranny that's called world government takeover the new world order is a planetary corporate plan
[3:18:39.660 --> 3:18:47.820]  for world government but world government is only the control grid now intermembers of the cult
[3:18:47.820 --> 3:18:53.340]  are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality but the price
[3:18:53.340 --> 3:19:00.220]  for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms that's why they
[3:19:00.220 --> 3:19:06.940]  say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god
[3:19:07.500 --> 3:19:12.780]  they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them
[3:19:12.780 --> 3:19:19.740]  advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane but if you read the
[3:19:19.740 --> 3:19:27.020]  writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the
[3:19:27.020 --> 3:19:34.140]  information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is
[3:19:34.140 --> 3:19:38.940]  the alien takeover of earth i'm going to say something right now that is one of the most
[3:19:38.940 --> 3:19:45.740]  important things i've ever said so please listen very very carefully donald trump is not the reason
[3:19:45.740 --> 3:19:50.540]  they released covid or had the lockdown they already had this plan the rockefeller foundation
[3:19:51.100 --> 3:19:57.100]  and billa melinda gates it is beyond critical it is life and death for you and your family to
[3:19:57.100 --> 3:20:02.620]  understand them i'd really want to plan it but this is a worldwide world government takeover
[3:20:02.620 --> 3:20:09.500]  on record that it's never going to end the united nations has admitted that first it's a month then
[3:20:09.500 --> 3:20:14.940]  it's six months then they say okay it's two years they're now saying two years they're now saying
[3:20:14.940 --> 3:20:21.260]  you'll never go back to normal no more gatherings no more anything constant forced inoculations
[3:20:21.260 --> 3:20:27.500]  that they admit don't even work in the way they say they work they change your dna this is the
[3:20:27.500 --> 3:20:32.780]  culling of the planet this is the beginning of a straight jacket being put on you before you're
[3:20:32.780 --> 3:20:45.580]  slowly tortured to death and killed you understand you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:45.580 --> 3:21:15.500]  hello hello great being on the alex jones show and as i said you better prepare
[3:21:15.500 --> 3:21:21.820]  for the worst and get those products and info wars that they're getting harder and harder to get
[3:21:22.460 --> 3:21:27.660]  you know there's a there's a supply chain shortage of everything we're doing some work around here
[3:21:27.660 --> 3:21:34.460]  we can't get treated uh lumber uh pressure treated lumber finding having trouble getting
[3:21:34.460 --> 3:21:42.860]  electrical supplies you know i thought that we were going to see drag flation which means that
[3:21:42.860 --> 3:21:51.020]  the economy is going to drag down but inflation is going to go up not because of the price of
[3:21:51.020 --> 3:21:57.980]  the products going up but because there's going to be a devaluation of the currency
[3:22:00.940 --> 3:22:07.580]  but prices are going up now because there's a global shortage of a lot of products because of
[3:22:07.580 --> 3:22:16.780]  the lockdowns so they're going to go up even higher and that's why i'm very bullish on gold
[3:22:16.780 --> 3:22:23.820]  and i do not give financial advice and silver which i think is going to be like a hundred dollars
[3:22:23.820 --> 3:22:34.140]  an ounce and again i only put it in the facts and the fact is that on info wars and our subscribers
[3:22:34.140 --> 3:22:44.620]  well know last june 19 2019 june 6 of 2019 the headline of our trend alert was gold bull run
[3:22:45.820 --> 3:22:55.340]  and gold was $1,332 an ounce as we're speaking now it's like what about you know 1970 you think
[3:22:55.340 --> 3:23:06.860]  your subscription was worth it anyway and then in june when silver was you know 1750 an ounce
[3:23:09.740 --> 3:23:14.700]  and he says it's the beginning of the silver bull run and now silver's while playing around
[3:23:14.700 --> 3:23:23.660]  $27 28 an ounce this is just the beginning of it i want to talk a little bit about
[3:23:23.660 --> 3:23:33.340]  the presidential reality show this is from the new york times the self-proclaimed paper of record
[3:23:33.340 --> 3:23:44.860]  which i call the toilet paper record harris pick indicative of new political calculus okay get out
[3:23:44.860 --> 3:23:52.460]  your calculator and let's do some political calculus first go to google and google up the
[3:23:52.460 --> 3:24:00.380]  definition of politician something that runs for political office a person that's manipulative
[3:24:00.380 --> 3:24:08.620]  and devious typically to gain advancement within an organization so that's political calculus
[3:24:08.620 --> 3:24:17.100]  manipulative and devious typically to gain advancement within an organization got it
[3:24:17.100 --> 3:24:25.820]  got it so harris pick indicative of new political calculus so let's add up
[3:24:27.580 --> 3:24:32.940]  gender and race have become more important than delivering home state
[3:24:34.700 --> 3:24:39.260]  well she's in california and of course the liberals in california are going to vote for them
[3:24:39.260 --> 3:24:45.100]  and trump was going to probably lose that state anyway so they're not concerned about that state
[3:24:45.100 --> 3:24:50.700]  state gender and race have become more important than delivering a home state that's political
[3:24:50.700 --> 3:24:59.740]  calculus i find gender and race becoming more important both sexist and racist as an american
[3:25:00.300 --> 3:25:08.940]  to me it's not about delivering a state i want the best person i find that picking someone for
[3:25:08.940 --> 3:25:16.780]  gender or race is sexist and racist according to the facts that are stated right here
[3:25:18.540 --> 3:25:31.180]  i run a business i could care less if they're black white green yellow transgender gay upside down
[3:25:31.180 --> 3:25:41.340]  inside out how about the best person to do the job why how dare you salenti what kind of moron are you
[3:25:43.420 --> 3:25:46.540]  we want someone
[3:25:51.580 --> 3:25:58.940]  where gender and race have become more important not my language there's that's not my america
[3:25:58.940 --> 3:26:04.860]  my america's land of the free home of the brave and this is in brave at all this is cowardly
[3:26:04.860 --> 3:26:11.900]  disgusting freaks that would do something like this how about the best person
[3:26:14.140 --> 3:26:22.460]  why i'm not racist or sexist hey i'm italian how about that piece of garbage slimy little crap ball
[3:26:22.460 --> 3:26:33.180]  fouchy now there's a piece of slime he's italian how about king kwama over here
[3:26:34.460 --> 3:26:44.380]  he's italian not my kind of an italian italian makes no difference at all unless it's fine italian food
[3:26:44.380 --> 3:26:56.220]  and these people are just putting out crap so it's not about who i like or what color my skin is
[3:26:58.220 --> 3:27:06.540]  whether a male female transgender gay i can care less i want the best person
[3:27:06.540 --> 3:27:12.700]  sexist and racist and they make it clear
[3:27:18.060 --> 3:27:22.380]  miss harris who is half black and half indian american is not expected to
[3:27:23.420 --> 3:27:32.380]  scramble the electoral map map nor was the former vice president nor the former vice president
[3:27:32.380 --> 3:27:37.980]  leads in polls of most of the crucial battleground so they're not looking her to do that here they go
[3:27:38.540 --> 3:27:47.100]  instead ever since black voters resurrected his primary candidacy in south carolina
[3:27:47.900 --> 3:27:56.620]  mr biden and his campaign have made the pursuit of black voters in november a centerpiece of his
[3:27:56.620 --> 3:28:02.780]  bid for the white house so that's the centerpiece not getting the best person
[3:28:05.260 --> 3:28:07.180]  getting the person who you think could win
[3:28:10.140 --> 3:28:11.500]  the race so here we go
[3:28:16.300 --> 3:28:24.060]  this is 100 a demographic selection said theodore r johnson a senior fellow at the
[3:28:24.060 --> 3:28:29.500]  brennan center for justice who studies voting behavior among black voters
[3:28:31.340 --> 3:28:35.580]  okay this is 100 a demographic selection
[3:28:40.060 --> 3:28:47.740]  and the story not the best selection or the best person no it's a demographic selection
[3:28:47.740 --> 3:28:58.460]  Robert shrum director of center for political future of the university of southern california
[3:28:59.420 --> 3:29:02.540]  said that more than anything the choice of miss harris should address
[3:29:03.260 --> 3:29:12.060]  one of the reasons mrs clinton lost to mr trump sonarily in 2016 one of the problems in 2016
[3:29:12.060 --> 3:29:18.380]  was a fall off of african-american votes in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania
[3:29:20.060 --> 3:29:29.500]  that's all it's about and hitlery clinton also lost ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages
[3:29:29.500 --> 3:29:37.900]  because people couldn't stand her look at the facts look at the polls her favorability raider
[3:29:37.900 --> 3:29:44.700]  christen was in the terrarium along with trumps but they had enough of us and they flushed it down
[3:29:45.660 --> 3:29:54.220]  because if my facts are correct less women voted for hitlery than they voted for trump
[3:29:56.860 --> 3:30:03.900]  so that's what the american election is not who's the best not who could do the best job
[3:30:03.900 --> 3:30:08.540]  uh how i can be political
[3:30:10.220 --> 3:30:17.180]  manipulative and devious typically to gain advancement within an organization
[3:30:18.940 --> 3:30:27.660]  this is disgusting and disgusting people ruling because if that's what's going to be
[3:30:27.660 --> 3:30:33.260]  ruin us we're going down to terrarium real bad
[3:30:57.660 --> 3:31:03.580]  have democrat blue states secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for joe bighton
[3:31:03.580 --> 3:31:08.780]  and the other public camo harris this has now been announced and they're going to use race
[3:31:08.780 --> 3:31:14.060]  war and rioting as the cover to try to drive trump from office the democratic party the
[3:31:14.060 --> 3:31:20.060]  shy comms the deep state are using black lives matter funded by soros as their cover to claim
[3:31:20.060 --> 3:31:25.660]  that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial riots and martial law that you're
[3:31:25.660 --> 3:31:31.500]  racist when in truth an old nazi collaborator george soros created black lives matter along
[3:31:31.500 --> 3:31:41.900]  with antifa america's fighting for its life but we will win the answer to 1984 is 1776
[3:31:41.900 --> 3:31:50.140]  so
[3:31:50.140 --> 3:31:55.020]  info wars has been banned arrested
[3:31:58.380 --> 3:32:06.220]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here
[3:32:06.220 --> 3:32:16.780]  go to fans dot video download the videos and share support the information war at infowarstore.com
[3:32:19.900 --> 3:32:26.460]  and never give up the fight
[3:32:26.460 --> 3:32:34.700]  so
[3:32:36.780 --> 3:32:42.780]  the united nations and the national institutes of health with the cdc are publicly conducting a
[3:32:42.780 --> 3:32:50.940]  4 000 person study spending tens of millions of dollars at yale on 15 ways to brainwash the public
[3:32:50.940 --> 3:32:56.300]  into taking inoculations basically squeezing you and forcing you to take them through guilt
[3:32:56.300 --> 3:33:00.700]  through fines they're not being able to go into stores not be able to get on airplanes or have
[3:33:00.700 --> 3:33:06.940]  jobs this is forced inoculations it's a public gateway pun that wrote about it last week
[3:33:06.940 --> 3:33:11.980]  david night wrote about it this week stories up on info wars dot com some people say oh i'll just
[3:33:11.980 --> 3:33:19.020]  wear a mask it's never gonna end that's just the sign of submission it's out she admits that next
[3:33:19.020 --> 3:33:25.260]  is the contact tracing of the apps on your phones and the inoculations that is a dna vaccine that
[3:33:25.260 --> 3:33:32.220]  changes your dna this isn't a science fiction movie it's happening right now compliance is death
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:39.820]  compliance is annihilation wake up wake up when the corrupt establishment began pushing joe biden
[3:33:39.820 --> 3:33:45.740]  two years ago they knew he had serious cognitive problems he has always been an empty suit that
[3:33:45.740 --> 3:33:51.660]  does what he's told by the globalist and their allied crime syndicates kamala harris is even
[3:33:51.660 --> 3:33:56.780]  worse than does whatever she's told and she's bought and paid for by silicon valley the chai
[3:33:56.780 --> 3:34:04.700]  comms and others so she has been chosen because she's part estrogen and now anyone that criticizes her
[3:34:04.700 --> 3:34:11.580]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach ladies and gentlemen we must expose
[3:34:11.580 --> 3:34:17.740]  the sponsor for who she is we must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people
[3:34:17.740 --> 3:34:24.300]  three times longer than white people that the woman is a monster kamala harris and will end up
[3:34:24.300 --> 3:34:31.260]  being our president if they're able to steal the election and she is a 110 new world order puppet
[3:34:31.260 --> 3:34:35.340]  now more than ever we must expose this monster we must expose the globalist
[3:34:35.340 --> 3:34:43.020]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:43.020 --> 3:35:05.020]  waging war on corruption it's gerald salente you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:35:05.020 --> 3:35:13.420]  hey great being on alex jones show i love that cover on that trans journal over there
[3:35:13.420 --> 3:35:19.100]  you can put that back for a second that's another anthony free to work of art and uh
[3:35:20.060 --> 3:35:29.260]  yeah junk food junk news junk brains and that's what we have and that's why you tune into info
[3:35:29.260 --> 3:35:37.420]  awards to get the information that you're not getting on the junk news and the junk brains
[3:35:38.140 --> 3:35:41.580]  that's being formed and of course that's why you read the trans journal
[3:35:42.220 --> 3:35:47.740]  and so i want to very happy to be on the show to keep the truth alive i want to stay on the
[3:35:47.740 --> 3:35:54.460]  kamala harris thing here a moment there's another big story in the toilet paper record last thursday
[3:35:54.460 --> 3:36:05.980]  progressive lose a coveted spot but a revolt isn't next how about revolting isn't next because
[3:36:05.980 --> 3:36:12.780]  that's who they are for the moment bernie sanders exited the presidential race in early april many
[3:36:12.780 --> 3:36:20.380]  activists organizers progressives punk groups and elected officials had held out hope that joseph
[3:36:20.380 --> 3:36:30.380]  our biden junior would elevate one of their ideological allies to the vice presidency someone
[3:36:30.380 --> 3:36:39.980]  like senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts so when biden announced on thursday that he had
[3:36:39.980 --> 3:36:46.220]  selected miss harris to serve his running mate his choice reaffirmed what many progressives had
[3:36:46.220 --> 3:36:53.660]  long feared that any potential biden administration would govern as the former vice president
[3:36:53.660 --> 3:37:00.780]  had spent most of his career quote firmly rooted in democratic establishment politics
[3:37:01.980 --> 3:37:13.340]  firmly rooted in democratic establishment politics firmly rooted in war and stealing our money
[3:37:13.340 --> 3:37:23.340]  and giving it to the bigs a warm monger with a track record of there's not one war that i don't
[3:37:23.340 --> 3:37:31.820]  love matter of fact the wall street journal did all the issues of how different harris and how
[3:37:31.820 --> 3:37:37.580]  the same they were on different issues and they listed them health care immigration
[3:37:37.580 --> 3:37:44.940]  and biba biba boop boop not one thing about foreign policy who cares about foreign policy
[3:37:44.940 --> 3:37:53.260]  i uh there were uh six deaths in uh florida yesterday oh yeah forget about the 10 million
[3:37:53.260 --> 3:38:01.420]  star than in uh in yemen the worst humanitarian crisis on earth thanks to the united states and
[3:38:01.420 --> 3:38:09.180]  its allies forget about the two million people america's killed in iraq destroyed the joint
[3:38:09.180 --> 3:38:14.540]  afghanistan wonder why people leaving they can't figure it out syria oh that nobel piece of
[3:38:14.540 --> 3:38:22.700]  crap prize winner that lovely guy that he was vice the vice president was for uh the vice president
[3:38:22.700 --> 3:38:29.900]  under obama the nobel piece of crap prize winner but rather than revolt because they're revolting
[3:38:29.900 --> 3:38:34.940]  many progressive activists and elected officials elected official pieces of crap
[3:38:34.940 --> 3:38:40.300]  immediately snuffed out their criticism and instead proclaimed their support
[3:38:41.260 --> 3:38:48.140]  applauding the selection and reiterating that removing president trump from office
[3:38:48.140 --> 3:38:55.660]  was their electoral priority not getting the best person that's their only priority quote
[3:38:55.660 --> 3:39:06.060]  quote at the end of the day this isn't some democratic decision said of evan weber the
[3:39:06.060 --> 3:39:10.140]  political director of sunrise movement about sunset movement
[3:39:13.660 --> 3:39:19.900]  the advocacy group which endorsed mr sanders in the primary this was always going to be
[3:39:19.900 --> 3:39:28.700]  be a decision that was up to the vice president and a personal one of his
[3:39:31.980 --> 3:39:35.980]  larry cohen chairman of sanders a line group our revolution
[3:39:38.060 --> 3:39:45.180]  said she's not warren or bass in terms of her background but i don't think it makes sense
[3:39:45.180 --> 3:39:54.940]  for us to criticize the reality so you're not allowed to criticize the reality of who harris is
[3:39:54.940 --> 3:40:03.660]  and how she got her way to the top that's another story but it's all there for everybody to read
[3:40:03.660 --> 3:40:17.740]  read all about it goes on to say that another one but while many groups and officials tended
[3:40:17.740 --> 3:40:25.900]  to show the party line others spoke more cautiously of their support quarry bush a progressive
[3:40:25.900 --> 3:40:32.540]  activist who will almost certainly head to congress after unseating house member in the
[3:40:32.540 --> 3:40:39.180]  democratic primary this month in st louis said she was quote torn and quote about the selection
[3:40:39.180 --> 3:40:51.260]  of miss harris quote i'm not going to tear down another woman of color oh oh then you're racist
[3:40:51.260 --> 3:41:03.900]  and sexist would you tear down a man not your color if you wanted to tear that person down
[3:41:03.900 --> 3:41:22.620]  this is sexist and racist miss bush you will not tear down another woman of color but as a
[3:41:22.620 --> 3:41:29.660]  progressive she goes on to say i have to stand with my progressive values well i would suggest
[3:41:29.660 --> 3:41:36.380]  miss bush you're a hypocrite because there's not one thing progressive about the track records
[3:41:37.020 --> 3:41:49.660]  of either the people that you're supporting progressive we think very differently progressive
[3:41:49.660 --> 3:42:03.420]  progressively descending going on among liberals the acceptance of miss harris if reluctant
[3:42:04.460 --> 3:42:13.580]  if reluctant still amounted to a surprising about face after months of lobbying for her more
[3:42:13.580 --> 3:42:25.580]  progressive rivals rivals to appear on the ticket if reluctant how about if you're a coward
[3:42:28.060 --> 3:42:37.260]  how about that reluctant cowards and that's all this has become
