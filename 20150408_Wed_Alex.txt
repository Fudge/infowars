[00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:06.148]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:07.910]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.672]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:11.254]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:12.796]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.065]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:42.622]  The federal government came out yesterday, and we talked about it some, but not enough, and said, you know what?
[00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:48.225]  Increased radiation from Fukushima is now hitting the West Coast.
[00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:53.009]  Well, it's been a while since we've had him on, but he interviews all the scientists, the experts, people on the ground.
[00:00:53.948 --> 00:01:06.459]  In the United States, in Northern Mexico, in Canada, up in Alaska, but also in Japan, Jerry Peterman of FukushimaUpdateReport.com is joining us in the third hour today.
[00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:13.506]  We need to focus in on Fukushima because it's a big issue in and of itself, but at the same time,
[00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:30.161]  Atomic accidents, nuclear accidents now are much more frequent but are swept under the rug and their magnitude is increasing exponentially and the response to them is completely watered down.
[00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:41.685]  It shows a very exterministic, nihilistic, satanic, anti-planet, anti-human, anti-life attitude that quite frankly fits into the whole
[00:01:45.425 --> 00:02:07.066]  System, the whole pantheon, the whole spectrum of globalist hellraiser galactic hoodlism, hoodlumism, I'm trying to think of the right word, galactic vandalism, that we see going on by the people running the show.
[00:02:09.534 --> 00:02:15.158]  So it's been picked up by the Statesman Journal and a lot of other publications on the West Coast, but very whitewashy.
[00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:18.400]  And we've got all these other reactors leaking around the world.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.124]  Over 90%, something like 92% of reactors, the Feds admit, in the United States alone are leaking.
[00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:32.108]  They're supposed to be retired for 30 years, they're 40 plus years operating, many of them, and it's just a ticking time bomb that's already gone off.
[00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:34.050]  But because it's a soft kill weapon,
[00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:38.551]  And it doesn't kill you in a week or a month or even a year in most cases.
[00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:40.674]  We just see the cancer rates climb and the rest of it.
[00:02:40.674 --> 00:02:47.463]  So we're going to spend an entire hour looking at this threat and other soft kill threats that are going on.
[00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:52.189]  There's obviously a lot of other news to get to.
[00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.571]  Democrats say the IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns.
[00:02:56.571 --> 00:03:05.255]  And the new thing, they want to pass a law to do this, it's already going on, but they want to have a law to offer to get rid of your tax bill if you turn your guns in and agree to not own guns.
[00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:12.918]  So see, they actuary the economy where you basically cannot operate unless you submit to their social engineering.
[00:03:12.918 --> 00:03:16.360]  We're going to get into that article on InfoWars.com from BizPacReview.
[00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:19.639]  Of course, it's the big news since yesterday.
[00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.299]  We're going to talk about it and play the video.
[00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.661]  South Carolina officer is charged with murder of Walter Scott.
[00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:33.483]  And the cop pulls him over, the guy runs, he shoots him in the back, and then drops a taser on him, claiming the guy tried to take his taser.
[00:03:33.483 --> 00:03:41.146]  And he is being indicted because a bystander shot video.
[00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:43.847]  And I tell you, it is this culture of covering up
[00:03:46.724 --> 00:03:58.987]  Crime by police that the feds are pushing at one level so they can then come in when the crisis reaches a fever pitch and federalize everything in the name of stopping the problem.
[00:03:58.987 --> 00:04:03.868]  But the truth is this surveillance society cuts both ways.
[00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:12.390]  And there's more news out today dealing with the National Security Agency learning everything it basically has done criminally from the Drug Enforcement Agency.
[00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.810]  DEA tracked billions
[00:04:14.913 --> 00:04:19.177]  of calls in the last 20 years, basically every phone call, illegally.
[00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:21.799]  And then use it to plant evidence on folks, you name it.
[00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.881]  That's your loving, loving feds who actually deal the drugs.
[00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:31.347]  The DEA is overshipping in the narcotics in this country, even more so than the CIA.
[00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:38.393]  Then their job, again, is just like Walmart will lobby to have a local farmer's market shut down in the city.
[00:04:38.393 --> 00:04:40.394]  They'll lobby, pay off the city council.
[00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:50.278]  Uh, with campaign contributions to shut down a farmer's market, the DEA is there to shut down anybody bringing anything in that they didn't get a big juicy cut of at the Federal Reserve.
[00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:55.280]  We're going to talk about that as well, the latest on Iran, the economy, and so much more.
[00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:00.827]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:05:00.827 --> 00:05:05.070]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.532]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:05:09.532 --> 00:05:16.836]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:23.160]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and oxygen.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.102]  Optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:26.102 --> 00:05:28.304]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:31.666]  DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:39.272]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.

[00:06:25.664 --> 00:06:27.125]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:38.555]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:42.616]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:07:17.606 --> 00:07:20.669]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.091]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:26.654]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:30.538]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[00:07:30.538 --> 00:07:39.186]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:44.612]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun, Vitamin D3.

[00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:23.735]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:55.535]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, already the eighth day of April 2015.
[00:08:55.535 --> 00:09:03.057]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here for the next three hours live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:09:03.057 --> 00:09:07.598]  Again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:11.139]  We have the gentleman that heads up the Fukushima
[00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:16.652]  Report, Fukushima Update Report, Jerry Peterman joining us.
[00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:22.414]  He stays on top of it, probably unlike anybody else out there.
[00:09:22.414 --> 00:09:26.996]  And we've got these new reports out of the Oceanographic Institution at Woods Hole.
[00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:30.357]  That's basically NOAA.
[00:09:30.357 --> 00:09:34.198]  Seaborne radiation now slamming at intense levels into
[00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:38.434]  The West Coast, but they're basically whitewashing it.
[00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:42.677]  Fukushima radiation has reached North American shores.
[00:09:42.677 --> 00:09:50.062]  That's out of the journal Statesman and other publications, USA Today and others.
[00:09:50.062 --> 00:09:52.663]  We're going to be going over that in the third hour.
[00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:59.608]  We'll also look at this report out of the LA Times of all places.
[00:09:59.608 --> 00:10:03.090]  NASA says we'll find alien life in 10 to 20 years.
[00:10:05.657 --> 00:10:15.641]  And of course, Stephen Hawking says, what are you doing sending these transmissions out to deep space telling everybody where we're at?
[00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:18.882]  Who knows what's really out there?
[00:10:18.882 --> 00:10:23.124]  Or is this all just a hologram?
[00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:25.425]  So we're going to be breaking that report down.
[00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:32.288]  Democrats say IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns.
[00:10:34.172 --> 00:10:39.436]  We're going to get into the South Carolina officer charged with the murder of Walter Scott.
[00:10:39.436 --> 00:10:48.343]  As he executes, he was shooting him in the back and then planting a taser on him and putting out the false report that he'd done for his taser.
[00:10:48.343 --> 00:10:51.005]  The entire frame-up caught on video.
[00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:55.948]  And that's why they're trying to pass laws all over the country that you can't video tape the police or anybody else.
[00:10:55.948 --> 00:10:57.229]  I think things like this are good.
[00:10:57.229 --> 00:11:00.212]  This will run corrupt officers out.
[00:11:00.212 --> 00:11:01.753]  Also, people that just want to kill.
[00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:15.074]  It's well known about 10% of the military get in just because they want to kill people, not because of family or because they want to serve the country or because they want a better way of life and scholarships.
[00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:17.294]  What about 10% getting in because they want to kill people in cold blood?
[00:11:17.294 --> 00:11:29.057]  And in my experience, and the statistics show this, we should do a whole report on it because people like George Soros are trying to exacerbate this problem and create a race war and an anti-police operation, which then they can federalize out of the crisis.
[00:11:29.057 --> 00:11:30.697]  But the statistics came out just a few months ago.
[00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:41.088]  That you're twice as likely to be shot by police statistically, not just because of the numbers, but per capita.
[00:11:41.088 --> 00:11:51.975]  Per 100 whites, 100 blacks, 100 Hispanics, you're more likely to be shot if you're white or Hispanic, those numbers are about the same, than if you're black.
[00:11:51.975 --> 00:11:54.097]  And of course the real reason for that is not good.
[00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.532]  Cops try to stay out of the really dangerous black neighborhoods.
[00:11:58.532 --> 00:12:09.219]  They don't respond and they don't really go in head first because they don't want to be politically blamed or indicted or set up.
[00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:14.423]  And so they basically slow call the dangerous inner city areas like South Chicago.
[00:12:15.322 --> 00:12:16.903]  And then they disintegrated to total hell.
[00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:20.786]  And of course most of the cops in the South Side of Chicago on record are black.
[00:12:20.786 --> 00:12:22.688]  They act just like white cops.
[00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:25.250]  They don't show up very quick.
[00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.333]  Because they don't want to be blamed with shooting somebody for a racial reason.
[00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:34.637]  This cop who shot this black guy in the back because he was running away had what I would call basically hunter fever.
[00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:37.169]  In most cases, that's what it is.
[00:12:37.169 --> 00:12:42.113]  They just can't stand that somebody's running away from them, instead of chasing them down or calling a helicopter.
[00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:44.234]  It was in a major city that had multiple helicopters.
[00:12:44.234 --> 00:12:45.996]  I mean, they have the person's car.
[00:12:45.996 --> 00:12:47.897]  You're going to get them.
[00:12:47.897 --> 00:12:49.198]  He killed him.
[00:12:49.198 --> 00:12:50.759]  And then went, oops, what'd I do?
[00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:55.483]  Better plant a taser on him, claiming he took it.
[00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:59.045]  So we'll be breaking that down coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:01.707]  And that ties into the other blackmail a few years ago.
[00:13:01.707 --> 00:13:03.509]  Remember out in California?
[00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:21.338]  In San Francisco, on the dark train, wasn't even part of the altercation, they pull everybody off the train, line them up, they're searching everybody, like it's the Soviet Union, put the guy in handcuffs, and the cop just pulls a gun out, shoots him right in the back, cold-bloodedly, and they make it up and say he tried to take his gun away.
[00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:37.261]  You see the cops on video grabbing everybody's cell phones, but somebody in another train had stopped, videotaped it, and the train, like a movie, rolls away right as the cops turn towards that train and figure out, oh, wait a minute, there might be cameras on there.
[00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:42.345]  Now they're moving with Apple and with Samsung and others, Droid, you name it.
[00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:47.326]  Where there's kill switches the last three years on all the new phones.
[00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.827]  And these are now in the threat fusion centers.
[00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:51.128]  The average cops haven't been getting access to it.
[00:13:51.128 --> 00:13:52.028]  Yeah, but they will.
[00:13:52.028 --> 00:14:03.753]  Where you hit a button, and on a street level, or a grid level, or part of a city, or a whole city, or a whole state, all the phones stop working entirely, or the camera functions turn off.
[00:14:03.753 --> 00:14:06.094]  I told you about that ten years ago.
[00:14:06.094 --> 00:14:11.096]  It's now in the news last year and this year, because they're rolling out with it operationally.
[00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:12.317]  At the Homeland Security level.
[00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:24.150]  And that's the problem with what they called for in the New York Times yesterday, what they called for in MIT Magazine yesterday, and what BMW called for yesterday.
[00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:45.715]  Is the fact that when you cut humans out of driving cars, or you cut humans out of flying planes, as the answer to kamikaze pilots, that is a basically non-existent problem in the history of air travel, maybe once or twice it's happened, where somebody tries to kill their passengers deliberately.
[00:14:45.715 --> 00:14:55.557]  The answer isn't find out why he did it, why he was on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, Prozac Clash, like every other person who does something screwball seems to be.
[00:14:55.557 --> 00:14:57.598]  The answer is get rid of pilots entirely.
[00:14:58.871 --> 00:14:59.892]  Who stops hackers?
[00:14:59.892 --> 00:15:01.954]  Who stops rogue government people?
[00:15:01.954 --> 00:15:06.038]  Who stops people in the system?
[00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:12.425]  Instead of hijacking one jet and crashing it, now when you centralize things, you can hijack all the jets and crash them.
[00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:19.670]  What if aliens show up with advanced technology and know how to instantly hack all of our computers?
[00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.734]  What they can do with all these smart meters and Trojan horses built and everything?
[00:15:23.734 --> 00:15:25.075]  And I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:15:25.075 --> 00:15:32.802]  Just start thinking about how you put an armored cockpit door in and now it lets a crazy co-pilot kill everybody.
[00:15:32.802 --> 00:15:36.365]  One security fix causes a whole other string of problems.
[00:15:36.365 --> 00:15:38.527]  That's why the answer is an open, free,
[00:15:39.788 --> 00:15:45.350]  Swashbuckling, frontier economy that goes into space.
[00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.890]  That's what empowers humans.
[00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.351]  Every philosopher's known it.
[00:15:50.351 --> 00:15:52.532]  In fact, it was even on a fortune cookie the other day.
[00:15:52.532 --> 00:15:56.573]  I think I shaved it.
[00:15:56.573 --> 00:16:07.276]  They were basically quoting Victor Hugo, the French philosopher and statesman, that adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[00:16:07.276 --> 00:16:09.137]  And it's absolutely true.
[00:16:12.654 --> 00:16:16.195]  I put up my wallet, but I can't find it.
[00:16:16.195 --> 00:16:20.517]  That we want to build a world that challenges humans.
[00:16:20.517 --> 00:16:24.118]  I remember 15, 16 years ago, they began banning dodgeball.
[00:16:24.118 --> 00:16:34.302]  And I said they will now ban wrestling, touching, hugging, shaking hands.
[00:16:34.302 --> 00:16:36.762]  Then they'll start trying to restrict contact sports.
[00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:40.524]  And now, coast to coast, in most school systems,
[00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:48.245]  There is no dodgeball, then there's no tag, there's no touch football, and now there's no running at recess.
[00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:52.287]  I see that article every week.
[00:16:52.287 --> 00:17:03.914]  Where a new school district announces no one can run at recess in the playground from elementary up, and no one can touch
[00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:11.250]  And that's the new socialist thing that parents are telling their children, even if they're not fighting.
[00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:17.236]  They say, you can't hug each other or touch each other in their homes.
[00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:20.359]  It's all prisoner training.
[00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.241]  Dehumanization training.
[00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.962]  The fake feminism.
[00:17:23.962 --> 00:17:27.306]  All of it is about breaking up the human community.
[00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:29.208]  It's so simple, it's so crystal clear.
[00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:32.856]  We have to empower humanity.
[00:17:32.856 --> 00:17:34.637]  We have to believe in humanity.
[00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:39.320]  We have to see how amazing humanity is to then reach for the stars.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:53.391]  But if you tell people they're crud and they're ugly and they're bad all day, unless you conform to the system, the only way you're beautiful is to work in the system and to comply with the system and then you can be held up as an example of something good.
[00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:57.495]  That's what collectivism and statism is all about.
[00:17:57.495 --> 00:18:08.678]  And it kills the individual, it kills free will, it kills understanding that you're alive only once and part of this amazing experience and this incredible destiny.
[00:18:08.678 --> 00:18:11.658]  And that we're all interconnected.
[00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:18.240]  They've trained the public to be so self-serving, so narcissistic, so envious, so jealous.
[00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:28.013]  That they think if they stand up for their fellow man, or do anything, or stick their head up above the grass, or stand up for any issue, that they're weak.
[00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:28.853]  They're a loser.
[00:18:28.853 --> 00:18:31.713]  That you get ahead by screwing everyone over.
[00:18:31.713 --> 00:18:34.654]  That you get ahead by being a manipulative liar.
[00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:37.375]  That you get ahead by being a piece of garbage.
[00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:40.255]  You can only do that for a time.
[00:18:40.255 --> 00:18:42.096]  Like cancer going through the body.
[00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:44.776]  If cancer had a consciousness, it would believe it was dominant.
[00:18:44.776 --> 00:18:47.237]  It would believe it was powerful for a season.
[00:18:47.237 --> 00:18:48.657]  Up six months, a year, two years.
[00:18:49.522 --> 00:18:51.583]  Racing through the body.
[00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:53.544]  Who could stand against it?
[00:18:53.544 --> 00:18:56.186]  Until it finally kills the host.
[00:18:56.186 --> 00:19:01.949]  And I don't watch a lot of television, but when I had surgery last week, I ended up staying home a lot.
[00:19:01.949 --> 00:19:04.370]  And so I would sleep some during the day and stay up at night.
[00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.852]  I probably watched six, seven episodes of House of Cards the first season.
[00:19:07.852 --> 00:19:09.873]  You know, I like the lead actor.
[00:19:09.873 --> 00:19:11.414]  He's a great actor.
[00:19:11.414 --> 00:19:16.377]  But the whole thing is a very sick message of Malthusian social Darwinism.
[00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:21.068]  Injustifies the means Machiavelli.
[00:19:21.068 --> 00:19:23.930]  And that's the overall message.
[00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.392]  It's very sick.
[00:19:25.392 --> 00:19:26.573]  It's a psychic virus.
[00:19:27.748 --> 00:19:35.113]  And people sit there who are powerless and believe acting like a sociopath or a psychopath is going to give them power.
[00:19:35.113 --> 00:19:38.095]  It's not going to give your seed power.
[00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:41.137]  It's not going to give your progeny power.
[00:19:41.137 --> 00:19:42.838]  And it's not going to give you power.
[00:19:42.838 --> 00:19:47.561]  You could have been a psychopath 50 years ago or 10 years ago and gotten power out of it for a time.
[00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:54.926]  We're now coming to the carrying capacity of sociopaths, psychopaths, narcissists, borderline personality disorder people on this planet.
[00:19:55.726 --> 00:19:58.035]  Who have been living off the goodwill of the rest of us.
[00:19:59.707 --> 00:20:00.507]  Bugging out?
[00:20:00.507 --> 00:20:02.548]  What if you don't make it to your bug out location?
[00:20:02.548 --> 00:20:05.649]  Could you survive in the woods for days, weeks, years?

[00:21:57.493 --> 00:21:58.873]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:21:58.873 --> 00:21:59.434]  Good, brother.
[00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:01.375]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:22:01.375 --> 00:22:03.096]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:22:03.096 --> 00:22:07.139]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:09.740]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.182]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:22:12.182 --> 00:22:14.203]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:20.366]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:20.366 --> 00:22:23.588]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:22:23.588 --> 00:22:25.128]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:22:25.128 --> 00:22:28.010]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.811]  Saved a ton of money there.
[00:22:29.811 --> 00:22:32.252]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:37.714]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.714 --> 00:22:49.640]  I want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where it's stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:56.543]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:22:58.141 --> 00:23:04.864]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[00:23:04.864 --> 00:23:09.265]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[00:23:09.265 --> 00:23:12.767]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:13.907]  Not fun!
[00:23:13.907 --> 00:23:22.290]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:27.052]  One World Away is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[00:23:27.392 --> 00:23:28.553]  My name is Errol.
[00:23:28.553 --> 00:23:30.094]  I'm 74 years old.
[00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:32.676]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[00:23:32.676 --> 00:23:40.521]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[00:23:40.521 --> 00:23:46.826]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:47.306]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:23:47.306 --> 00:23:47.506]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:23:47.506 --> 00:23:48.707]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[00:24:18.473 --> 00:24:31.997]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to look at the militarization of police in this country, and go back to the Phoenix Project that was partially declassified in the 80s, that was carried out in Vietnam.
[00:24:31.997 --> 00:24:43.321]  And the Phoenix Project is a precursor to the operations carried out by basically above special forces groups here inside the United States and worldwide.
[00:24:43.321 --> 00:24:47.062]  And yes, the major groups, because they're even larger,
[00:24:48.038 --> 00:25:01.896]  uh... than the special forces groups that are known of are basically above special forces and they're beyond the contractors as well and more and more of that shadow government army uh... is becoming public
[00:25:03.677 --> 00:25:21.037]  But I want to break down the shadow assassin army with an excellent John Bowne report that I'll augment with some other intel tying it into the Phoenix program and Senator Kerry, not John Kerry, the other senator who was involved in the Phoenix project.
[00:25:21.037 --> 00:25:23.199]  So that is all coming up.
[00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:26.690]  Torture, assassinations, you name it.
[00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:33.117]  That's why one of the former top Cuban exiles, anti-communist, went public last week and said, I'm worried about Jade Helm.
[00:25:33.117 --> 00:25:35.019]  I saw the footage here in Florida.
[00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:37.182]  That's training to round us up.
[00:25:37.182 --> 00:25:41.967]  But I told the crew and I told the listeners, part of Jade Helm will then be announced.
[00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:45.030]  This big, now ten state, it was seven state, then eight state.
[00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:58.113]  This 10-state operation will be announced and they'll have dirty bomb and decontamination for chemical attacks on the news that's totally legitimate out of the Department of Ordnance disposal of the Army.
[00:25:59.295 --> 00:26:01.516]  Because it's not my first rodeo.
[00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:10.620]  Every time we catch Delta Force doing takeover drills of the city of San Antonio, or Kingsville, or Houston, or doing it in East St.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:18.744]  Louis, then they'll have a report the next week, look, the Army was out helping firefighters deal with a dirty bomb.
[00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:23.987]  Sure enough, they announced yesterday that Jade Helms a bunch of dirty bomb drills.
[00:26:24.915 --> 00:26:30.897]  I mean, they run the same plays to brainwash the public over and over again.
[00:26:30.897 --> 00:26:33.719]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:38.260]  There is just an over-the-top headline on DrugsReport.com.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.022]  It's also on Infowars.com, but you can't miss it on DrugsReport.com.
[00:26:42.022 --> 00:26:46.444]  Cheney, Obama wants to make, wants to take America down.
[00:26:46.444 --> 00:26:48.925]  Such a stunning headline, I can't even read it correctly.
[00:26:48.925 --> 00:26:51.606]  Cheney, Obama wants to take America down.
[00:26:54.158 --> 00:26:55.379]  Well, that's actually true.
[00:26:55.379 --> 00:27:02.324]  And everybody knows I'm not a fan of Dick Cheney and his Patriot Act and his police state and his drug war, but the Daily Caller has the headline.
[00:27:02.324 --> 00:27:03.745]  And there's video of this.
[00:27:03.745 --> 00:27:05.006]  We need to get that video.
[00:27:05.006 --> 00:27:07.188]  I want to play it coming up in the next segment.
[00:27:07.188 --> 00:27:11.691]  Cheney, President Obama wants to take America down.
[00:27:11.691 --> 00:27:13.733]  He told the Hugh Hewitt Show.
[00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:23.616]  Tuesday night, former Vice President Dick Cheney said that President Obama's actions on the world stage exemplify a president who wants to take America down.
[00:27:23.616 --> 00:27:29.360]  Regardless of what you think of Dick Cheney, that's a true statement.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:35.965]  Obama really is, and this is a blind spot I had, I thought Obama would be a fake globalist liberal.
[00:27:37.099 --> 00:27:45.145]  And I thought that he really was just an establishment insider who wanted to bankrupt the middle class and consolidate power, but still keep the American empire going.
[00:27:45.145 --> 00:27:55.553]  He actually is phasing us into the fall of the American empire with this Chinese investment bank and this trilateral acceleration and transferring the power to the UN and NATO.
[00:27:56.354 --> 00:27:58.374]  That's why he became the first U.S.
[00:27:58.374 --> 00:28:05.176]  President to head the Global Security Council, which violates Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution.
[00:28:05.176 --> 00:28:17.459]  Remember, they had all these top globalists like Henry Kissinger at that event a few years ago when he became the head of the Security Council because it violates the law.
[00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:24.280]  You can't have the President chair the most powerful position, more powerful than the head of the U.N.
[00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:38.933]  More powerful than Boutros Boutros Ghali and Ban Ki-moon and all the other UN heads that we've seen as the Secretary Generals.
[00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:40.555]  Unprecedented.
[00:28:40.555 --> 00:28:47.420]  So when we come back, we've got that video of Dick Cheney, says Obama wants to take America down.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.862]  That's actually true.
[00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:53.124]  Dick Cheney, for all the horrible things he did,
[00:28:55.490 --> 00:29:01.112]  Never tried to overthrow Egypt and put the Muslim Brotherhood in charge.
[00:29:01.112 --> 00:29:10.316]  Dick Cheney didn't come after our guns.
[00:29:10.316 --> 00:29:12.516]  Dick Cheney came after our borders.
[00:29:12.516 --> 00:29:15.037]  He came after our sovereignty, the North American Union.
[00:29:15.037 --> 00:29:21.880]  I mean, he followed the whole program that Obama's following, but under Obama, it is really accelerated.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.800]  And that's saying a lot.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.501]  That as bad as Bush and Cheney were,
[00:29:25.757 --> 00:29:29.119]  Now Cheney is saying Obama wants to take America down.
[00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:34.303]  It's just so strange to hear something truthful out of Dick Cheney's mouth.
[00:29:34.303 --> 00:29:37.605]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:29:37.605 --> 00:29:39.786]  And then we've got huge war news, obviously.
[00:29:39.786 --> 00:29:41.907]  This is huge out of AFP.
[00:29:41.907 --> 00:29:42.188]  U.S.
[00:29:42.188 --> 00:29:48.272]  Aerospace Command moving their comm centers here back into bunkers.
[00:29:48.272 --> 00:29:49.672]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.672 --> 00:29:52.194]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.194 --> 00:29:54.876]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.013 --> 00:30:05.236]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.917]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:30:07.917 --> 00:30:14.960]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.941]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:20.903]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:30:20.903 --> 00:30:22.924]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:25.785]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:30:25.845 --> 00:30:31.568]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:35.090]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.172]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:32:28.445 --> 00:32:29.466]  Alex Jones here.
[00:32:29.466 --> 00:32:38.750]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[00:33:12.918 --> 00:33:19.662]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:19.662 --> 00:33:20.902]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.215 --> 00:33:26.817]  Powered by Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
[00:33:26.817 --> 00:33:28.378]  At least, that's where I stand.
[00:33:28.378 --> 00:33:29.498]  That's what I'm powered by.
[00:33:29.498 --> 00:33:31.640]  By the grace of God.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:44.448]  And, coming up behind that, all the Liberty Louders throughout history, the Renaissance men and women that don't want to be slaves, folks like George Washington, who is in our control room, hanging on the banner, in the center of things.
[00:33:44.448 --> 00:33:46.550]  We can cut back over there for TV viewers.
[00:33:47.622 --> 00:33:58.651]  And we are fighting the antithesis of people like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson when we discuss Obama, who is becoming more and more a dictator in everything he does.
[00:33:58.651 --> 00:34:13.383]  And then, of course, the powers that be want that, so that the next puppet president they buy for several billion dollars, whether they be Democrat or Republican, will have the power to let the global bureaucracy and corporations loot this country at an even faster rate.
[00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:20.457]  Speaking of Dick Cheney coming out saying President Obama wants to take America down.
[00:34:20.457 --> 00:34:27.081]  Yeah, Dick Cheney wanted to suck off of America and build a Pax Americana global empire based on America.
[00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:29.242]  That's what the neocons want.
[00:34:29.242 --> 00:34:32.685]  They wrote about it in Project for a New American Century, April of 2000.
[00:34:32.685 --> 00:34:40.029]  40-something page report written by Dick Cheney and Jeb Bush.
[00:34:40.029 --> 00:34:42.171]  But when you look at Obama's world plan,
[00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.592]  I used to disagree with Dinesh D'Souza and others that...
[00:34:49.341 --> 00:34:53.304]  Obama was an anti-colonialist and so just hated America.
[00:34:53.304 --> 00:34:54.645]  Why would the globalists put him in power?
[00:34:54.645 --> 00:34:57.126]  But he sees the middle class as colonialists.
[00:34:57.126 --> 00:35:07.634]  He sees anybody, Africans with a nice car, or a house, or a good farm, or as doctors, or progress, as competition against them.
[00:35:07.634 --> 00:35:12.917]  They see human activity and liberty and prosperity as a threat against their hegemonic takeover.
[00:35:12.917 --> 00:35:18.281]  So there is a difference between the neocons and Obama, even though Obama's cabinet is full of neocons.
[00:35:19.977 --> 00:35:34.127]  The ideology of the anti-human left, the eugenical left, really is powering and driving things and animating things in this cultureless wasteland that's globalism.
[00:35:34.127 --> 00:35:42.954]  The socialist, leftist, communist culture used to take over societies, like a disease, even threatens the establishment itself.
[00:35:45.379 --> 00:35:53.923]  Continuing here, here's the big news, again the Dick Cheney clip, saying Obama wants to take America down.
[00:35:53.923 --> 00:36:03.107]  Mr. Vice President, or does he have a far-reaching vision that only he entertains of a realigned Middle East that somehow it all works out in the end?
[00:36:04.361 --> 00:36:05.502]  I don't know, Hugh.
[00:36:05.502 --> 00:36:26.974]  I vacillate between the various theories I've heard, but, you know, if you had somebody as president who wanted to take America down, who wanted to fundamentally weaken our position in the world, reduce our capacity to influence events, turn our back on our allies, and encourage our adversaries, it would look exactly like what Barack Obama would do it.
[00:36:26.974 --> 00:36:33.818]  I think his actions are constituted, in my mind, those of the worst president we've ever had.
[00:36:35.891 --> 00:36:43.736]  I really don't like that clip because it really freaks me out to hear Dick Cheney telling the truth.
[00:36:43.736 --> 00:36:46.538]  And I just have a real problem with it.
[00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:48.360]  But it is the truth.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:55.384]  Barack Obama is the worst president this country has ever had.
[00:36:55.384 --> 00:36:56.605]  Obamacare.
[00:36:56.605 --> 00:36:57.586]  Ending our sovereignty.
[00:36:57.586 --> 00:36:58.206]  Open borders.
[00:36:58.206 --> 00:36:59.967]  Coming out with the guns.
[00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:02.709]  Federalizing what our kids eat.
[00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:04.831]  I mean, what planet did I wake up on here?
[00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:10.307]  And then, this is just part of the military news today.
[00:37:10.307 --> 00:37:12.490]  The deteriorating situation.
[00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:12.950]  U.S.
[00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:18.896]  Aerospace Command moving comms gear back to Cold War bunker.
[00:37:18.896 --> 00:37:20.437]  AFP.
[00:37:20.437 --> 00:37:31.728]  And of course, we told you last week with Joel Skousen, who's got a lot of high-level contacts, so do we, the elites are going back into the bunkers, they're building new ones, they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off, while telling us there's no problem.
[00:37:32.998 --> 00:37:34.178]  French news agency, the U.S.
[00:37:34.178 --> 00:37:42.380]  military command that scans North American skies for enemy missiles and aircraft plans to move its communications gear to a Cold War-era mountain bunker, officer said.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:52.923]  The ship to Cheyenne Mountain Base in Colorado is designed to safeguard the command's sensitive sensors and servers from a potential electromagnetic EMP pulse attack, military officer said.
[00:37:52.923 --> 00:37:54.363]  They never moved anything out of there.
[00:37:54.363 --> 00:37:55.624]  They got a whole bunch of bases.
[00:37:55.624 --> 00:37:57.244]  SIDAR, you name it.
[00:37:57.244 --> 00:37:59.205]  Submarine bases, space bases.
[00:37:59.205 --> 00:38:00.025]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:38:00.663 --> 00:38:09.828]  The Pentagon last week announced $700 million contract with Raytheon Corporation to oversee the work of North American Aerospace Command, NORAD, and the U.S.
[00:38:09.828 --> 00:38:12.289]  Northern Command.
[00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:22.234]  And they go on to have the head of Northern Command say, because of the very nature of the way Cheyenne Mountain is built, it's EMP hardened.
[00:38:23.174 --> 00:38:25.735]  And they go on to say we're doing this because of EMP threat.
[00:38:25.735 --> 00:38:27.096]  You can read the full article.
[00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:28.897]  We have it linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:28.897 --> 00:38:29.597]  Here's another one.
[00:38:29.597 --> 00:38:32.158]  Japan's launching new giant aircraft carriers.
[00:38:32.158 --> 00:38:33.219]  Japan's got nukes.
[00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:35.100]  Told you that a long time ago.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:40.002]  They even had explosions in Tokyo and, you know, caught the guys in their building.
[00:38:40.002 --> 00:38:42.583]  Remember that about 14 years ago?
[00:38:42.583 --> 00:38:47.065]  It was all a bunch of old men, old World War II vets and people that were seen as expendable.
[00:38:47.065 --> 00:38:49.827]  You can tell those old-timers go in there and work on this stuff.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.862]  The Japanese are just something else, folks.
[00:38:52.862 --> 00:38:57.226]  And they're gearing up for war with China.
[00:38:57.226 --> 00:39:00.969]  New defense rules would give Japan new powers to aid U.S.
[00:39:00.969 --> 00:39:03.771]  military.
[00:39:03.771 --> 00:39:06.154]  So we've got all of that.
[00:39:06.154 --> 00:39:06.514]  U.S.
[00:39:06.514 --> 00:39:09.637]  to speed up delivery of weapons to Saudi-led forces.
[00:39:10.984 --> 00:39:12.304]  That's out of the Washington Post.
[00:39:12.304 --> 00:39:22.327]  This is out of Fox News for the Shiite-Sunni civil war raging in Yemen with the Chinese military pulling its people out last week.
[00:39:22.327 --> 00:39:25.568]  Meanwhile, Iran's deployed warships off Yemen's coast.
[00:39:25.568 --> 00:39:29.729]  Saudi Arabia and several Arab allies have imposed an air and naval blockade on Yemen.
[00:39:29.729 --> 00:39:30.869]  This is Reuters.
[00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:35.030]  This is escalating real fast.
[00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.931]  The Russians have come out and said they didn't carry out White House computer hack.
[00:39:39.428 --> 00:39:44.852]  Their government officials say this has become a sport to blame Russia.
[00:39:44.852 --> 00:39:55.219]  You know, I don't just believe Russia and everything they say, but I've told you most of these latest hacks of Sony, you name it, are inside jobs, just to pass a bunch of legislation to restrict the Internet.
[00:39:55.219 --> 00:39:59.523]  And that's why you're hearing about Internet kill switches and censorship now, because they're making their move.
[00:40:02.645 --> 00:40:04.467]  I want to get to the video.
[00:40:04.467 --> 00:40:06.408]  If you're a radio listener, I'll go through it play-by-play.
[00:40:06.408 --> 00:40:16.016]  If you're a radio listener, you can also on your Droid or iPhone or home computer, whatever the case is, InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the free feed.
[00:40:16.016 --> 00:40:18.879]  The daytime radio show is not subscription.
[00:40:18.879 --> 00:40:21.001]  It's the nightly news that is.
[00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:23.062]  That's only 15 cents a day.
[00:40:23.062 --> 00:40:24.764]  20 people can use it.
[00:40:24.764 --> 00:40:27.206]  That's just to pay for the bandwidth, the cameras, and the reporters.
[00:40:28.601 --> 00:40:29.602]  And it does that.
[00:40:29.602 --> 00:40:35.146]  So, as it becomes self-sufficient, we're moving towards a day when it will be free.
[00:40:35.146 --> 00:40:38.929]  Might not be a year, might not be two years, but that's where we're going.
[00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:45.814]  As bandwidth prices lower, we go from one 595 membership one person can use to 20.
[00:40:45.814 --> 00:40:56.341]  But if you don't have a membership of 595 a month, or a yearly membership, it's like three months off that price, you should go to PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:06.947]  And all you do is sign up and create a username and passcode that's original to the site so you can share the username with your friends and family.
[00:41:06.947 --> 00:41:16.554]  And then if one day you go to watch the nightly news at seven o'clock, that's really excellent and powerful and hard-hitting and breaks a lot of news and amazing in-depth interviews.
[00:41:16.554 --> 00:41:17.856]  Sometimes it's like eight hours long.
[00:41:17.856 --> 00:41:20.798]  It's always 30 minutes, but sometimes it's most nights it's an hour or longer.
[00:41:20.798 --> 00:41:24.201]  We're having to tailor it soon as I get up off my butt.
[00:41:24.994 --> 00:41:27.396]  We got all these cable stations, TV stations ready to launch it.
[00:41:27.396 --> 00:41:28.496]  Some have already started picking it up.
[00:41:28.496 --> 00:41:30.358]  We're very close to that.
[00:41:30.358 --> 00:41:35.981]  Things like hernias and family issues and other operations we're running, you know, getting away of that.
[00:41:35.981 --> 00:41:39.624]  But this embryonic system is at the next launch level.
[00:41:39.624 --> 00:41:41.305]  We're going through the birthing pains of that right now.
[00:41:41.305 --> 00:41:48.610]  I don't want to thank all you that are PrisonPlanet.tv members, but you just go there, become a member, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:50.471]  It takes about 60 seconds to sign up.
[00:41:50.471 --> 00:41:52.132]  It's as easy as buying a movie ticket online.
[00:41:53.328 --> 00:42:03.910]  And then, you create a username you can share with friends and family, and if you try to go watch it at 7 o'clock, and 20 people have logged in and you're blocked, well, praise the Lord and pass the ammunition!
[00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:07.411]  Get another membership for $5.95.
[00:42:07.411 --> 00:42:13.032]  This is where it's at, and so we have our own platform that's harder for them to censor and shut down.
[00:42:13.032 --> 00:42:16.933]  And it also funds the operation, so I want to thank you all that are members, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:25.405]  Now, I want to talk about something really life-changing and miraculous here in a moment, and then we come back from this little piece we're about to air.
[00:42:25.405 --> 00:42:40.957]  We're going to get into South Carolina officer is charged with the murder of Walter Scott and how that ties into the militarization of police and how that ties into police state America is kidnapping your pets, demanding money, or killing them if you don't.
[00:42:43.288 --> 00:42:53.317]  We're going to tie that into DEA official says agency's mass surveillance program before 9-11 served as blueprint for the NSA since 1947.
[00:42:53.317 --> 00:42:57.301]  They've tracked billions of calls every year.
[00:42:57.301 --> 00:43:00.384]  Essentially every phone call.
[00:43:00.384 --> 00:43:02.626]  Without a warrant to quote find out who's dealing drugs.
[00:43:02.626 --> 00:43:04.608]  Give me a break.
[00:43:04.608 --> 00:43:08.392]  The drug dealers created the National Security Act and the DEA.
[00:43:10.785 --> 00:43:16.389]  I've interviewed the soldiers, the Marines, it's been on the news, BBC, Fox News, CNN.
[00:43:16.389 --> 00:43:18.211]  They have to hide it in plain view now.
[00:43:18.211 --> 00:43:22.794]  That, oh, our troops help grow the opium and then it's loaded on C-130s and we don't know where it goes.
[00:43:22.794 --> 00:43:27.718]  It goes to Europe, it goes to Russia, it goes to Asia, it goes to this country.
[00:43:27.718 --> 00:43:33.963]  So your children, your wives, your husbands end up on it.
[00:43:33.963 --> 00:43:36.805]  And then they got the nerve to have snacks, is what they call it.
[00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:48.727]  And to sit there and feed on you and your family when you're dumb enough to use it.
[00:43:48.727 --> 00:43:52.470]  That's how slavery's been legalized again, is the drug war.
[00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:56.653]  And there's a lot of angles to attack the drug war, but the biggest one is the truth.
[00:43:56.653 --> 00:44:05.380]  It is a globalist-run operation with over a trillion dollars a year, 500 billion of it in the North American market, of narcotics alone.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:09.202]  And the same big families and companies that push Prozac on everybody and Ritalin
[00:44:10.239 --> 00:44:13.503]  And all these other garbage drugs are the ones pushing the illegal drugs.
[00:44:13.503 --> 00:44:15.446]  And people think the drug culture is cool.
[00:44:15.446 --> 00:44:16.207]  It's not cool.
[00:44:16.207 --> 00:44:17.028]  It's dirty.
[00:44:17.028 --> 00:44:17.829]  It's pathetic.
[00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:18.891]  It's a joke.
[00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:20.933]  Don't use drugs, kids!
[00:44:23.217 --> 00:44:29.981]  Don't give money to the Federal Reserve, who's been caught hundreds of times laundering the money and doesn't get in trouble.
[00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:34.123]  Don't give money to Warren Buffett, whose banks have been caught laundering hundreds of billions.
[00:44:34.123 --> 00:44:36.564]  Don't give them any money!
[00:44:36.564 --> 00:44:37.645]  I hate them!
[00:44:37.645 --> 00:44:42.467]  And don't give McDonald's any money, or Monsanto any money, or any of these people!
[00:44:42.467 --> 00:44:42.848]  Stop it!
[00:44:42.848 --> 00:44:46.710]  It's the only way to break their back!
[00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.090]  Excuse me.
[00:44:49.036 --> 00:44:49.836]  That's why the D.A.R.E.
[00:44:49.836 --> 00:44:51.657]  program doubled drug use.
[00:44:51.657 --> 00:44:52.798]  Look it up.
[00:44:52.798 --> 00:44:56.240]  Suicide prevention programs doubled or tripled suicide.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.761]  Nightline did reports on that in 2003.
[00:44:57.761 --> 00:45:05.545]  You go teach 10 and 11 year old girls how to strangle themselves with shoelaces?
[00:45:05.545 --> 00:45:06.525]  They never thought of that.
[00:45:06.525 --> 00:45:08.727]  They're gonna go do it!
[00:45:08.727 --> 00:45:13.829]  Then the answer is psychologically screen everybody and drug everyone with drugs that make you kill yourself!
[00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:14.530]  It's a plan!
[00:45:15.538 --> 00:45:16.278]  And I'm angry!
[00:45:16.278 --> 00:45:17.819]  I'm not a slave!
[00:45:17.819 --> 00:45:19.219]  I've broken the conditioning!
[00:45:19.219 --> 00:45:20.300]  It doesn't work on me!
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.540]  I'm primitive!
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.260]  I'm real!
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.000]  I know the enemy!
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.822]  And if we can have the spirit of normal humanity spread, it's over for the globalist!
[00:45:27.822 --> 00:45:30.743]  Break the conditioning now!
[00:45:30.743 --> 00:45:32.824]  Excuse me.
[00:45:32.824 --> 00:45:32.964]  Now.
[00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.267]  We're launching the Alex Pack Challenge.
[00:45:38.267 --> 00:45:40.709]  That's different from the Great Longevity Alex Pack.
[00:45:40.709 --> 00:45:48.152]  It's the three key products at InfoWarsHealth.com that you can get discounted and get free shipping and 30% off on that, the Alex Pack.
[00:45:48.152 --> 00:45:51.313]  This is the Alex Challenge Pack.
[00:45:51.313 --> 00:45:53.914]  Three products.
[00:45:53.914 --> 00:45:58.477]  Three products we're announcing today.
[00:45:58.477 --> 00:45:59.157]  Free shipping.
[00:46:00.302 --> 00:46:02.043]  We had it on everything last week.
[00:46:02.043 --> 00:46:06.525]  Now it's just on the Alex Challenge Pack at Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:06.525 --> 00:46:11.487]  The X2 Nacin Iodine, the Super Male or Super Female Vitality, and the Oxy Powder.
[00:46:11.487 --> 00:46:15.049]  Free shipping on the already discounted three products together.
[00:46:15.049 --> 00:46:18.070]  All I know is you take all these together, dramatic results.
[00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.991]  I've gone from 279 down to, it's like 225 now.
[00:46:19.991 --> 00:46:24.393]  And if I could just lose that last 25 pounds.
[00:46:27.921 --> 00:46:32.969]  I lost six and a half pounds, roughly, in the last 45 days before my surgery.
[00:46:32.969 --> 00:46:36.535]  I haven't even gained weight since I had the surgery last week.
[00:46:36.535 --> 00:46:37.737]  I haven't exercised until this morning.
[00:46:37.737 --> 00:46:38.759]  I did some white walking.
[00:46:41.207 --> 00:46:43.009]  And it's just been dramatic.
[00:46:43.009 --> 00:46:44.570]  So we're launching this special.
[00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:47.192]  It's going to run for a couple weeks.
[00:46:47.192 --> 00:46:52.296]  It is the Alex Challenge Pack at Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:52.296 --> 00:46:58.901]  And you can get free shipping on the OxyPower to flush out your guts, the iodine to block the estrogen mimickers, clean out the thyroid.
[00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:00.682]  It just supercharges, detoxes.
[00:47:00.682 --> 00:47:02.624]  Consult your physician, though, because it's the real deal.
[00:47:02.624 --> 00:47:03.805]  I mean, you're going to feel it.
[00:47:03.805 --> 00:47:05.626]  You might have a detox in 15 days.
[00:47:05.626 --> 00:47:06.087]  I know I did.
[00:47:06.974 --> 00:47:13.698]  And then you add the super male vitality to that, or super female if you're a woman, and it'll blow you away.
[00:47:13.698 --> 00:47:20.103]  The Alex Challenge Pack, InfoWars, Life.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:23.505]  If you're not a TV viewer, you should go to your smartphone or Droid right now.
[00:47:24.701 --> 00:47:44.380]  But I'm going to actually have this uploaded to YouTube in the next hour so we can post it on the site so folks can see it and also post it to YouTube just with the promo by itself on the Alex Challenge Pack special page so people can see the results of when I weighed 180 pounds and could do 40 pull-ups and bench press 350 pounds and squat 600 pounds naturally when I was 22 and quit working out.
[00:47:48.664 --> 00:47:54.708]  Versus the job of the hunt I became, and then now 60 plus pounds off of me, another 20 to go.
[00:47:54.708 --> 00:47:58.991]  I gained 98 succulent pounds.
[00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:01.493]  I was so depressed fighting the glove I almost thought I'd be killed any minute.
[00:48:01.493 --> 00:48:02.374]  Just stop caring.
[00:48:02.374 --> 00:48:03.955]  Let's go to this piece right now.
[00:48:05.734 --> 00:48:07.715]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:48:07.715 --> 00:48:13.997]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:48:13.997 --> 00:48:22.840]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world and install a corporate fascist state.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.381]  I had read their own books, discovered their own documents.
[00:48:25.381 --> 00:48:29.322]  And my focus went from running six miles every other day
[00:48:29.822 --> 00:48:36.286]  Swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, but focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:48:36.286 --> 00:48:42.049]  I transformed my body from the beautiful gift that God gave me, into something more akin to Jabba the Hutt.
[00:48:42.049 --> 00:48:43.530]  It became an internet joke.
[00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:48.213]  But now I've started the transformation back, getting my body, my temple, in shape.
[00:48:48.213 --> 00:48:49.754]  And I'm about to tell you how I did it.
[00:48:50.214 --> 00:48:58.461]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:48:58.461 --> 00:49:03.405]  I started taking Supramel Vitality and saw incredible results in just a few weeks.
[00:49:03.405 --> 00:49:09.870]  The problem was, though, I'd never been a vitamin and mineral and supplement taker before, so I kept forgetting to do it.
[00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.651]  So after I'd lost over 60 pounds,
[00:49:13.172 --> 00:49:21.180]  Just a month and a half ago, I asked the crew to take a photo of me in the same lighting to see what I could do in just a month and a half.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.602]  This is what happened in just 45 days.
[00:49:23.602 --> 00:49:36.974]  We took this photo back there in the back office, and I'd already lost a lot of weight, but I lost another six pounds with the Oxy Powder and the other products in 4WheelsLife.com, and this photo was just taken a few days ago.
[00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:38.876]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss, it
[00:49:39.857 --> 00:49:44.582]  My muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:50.568]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:49:50.568 --> 00:49:56.934]  Today is the day to take the Infowarslife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:49:57.094 --> 00:50:02.379]  We've got to get our temple straight before we can go out and fight the globalists, and that's what these products have helped me do.
[00:50:02.379 --> 00:50:06.062]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.
[00:50:06.062 --> 00:50:08.904]  They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[00:50:08.904 --> 00:50:10.426]  And you also then fund our operation.
[00:50:16.991 --> 00:50:22.497]  And that's kind of a typo when I cut that video last week because I say 235 pounds.
[00:50:22.497 --> 00:50:24.479]  I was about 229 by then.
[00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:29.805]  I was saying my old weight actually before I lost the other six pounds, but the photos are clear.
[00:50:30.939 --> 00:50:37.223]  Just taking three or four dropperfuls a day of Supermail, I know is what gave me the energy, the stamina to go over the next level.
[00:50:37.223 --> 00:50:41.466]  The detoxing of the Oxy Powder and the X2 together, the synergy.
[00:50:41.466 --> 00:50:42.226]  Try it, folks.
[00:50:42.226 --> 00:50:43.527]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[00:50:43.527 --> 00:50:49.811]  And bottom line, you're funding the tip of the spear that's defending sovereignty, the family, religious freedom, and the Second Amendment.
[00:50:49.811 --> 00:50:50.591]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:50.591 --> 00:50:53.633]  Infowarslife.com to get started today.
[00:50:53.633 --> 00:50:54.854]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:51:13.239 --> 00:51:16.221]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[00:51:30.207 --> 00:51:33.810]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:37.232]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:51:37.232 --> 00:51:41.296]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[00:51:41.296 --> 00:51:46.800]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.921]  Protect yourself.

[00:51:55.707 --> 00:51:56.767]  Come and take it.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.141]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:06.243]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.243 --> 00:52:14.366]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.366 --> 00:52:18.908]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:18.908 --> 00:52:22.869]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:22.869 --> 00:52:25.290]  They now operate two distribution facilities.
[00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:28.811]  And employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:28.811 --> 00:52:31.972]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:31.972 --> 00:52:37.333]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:37.333 --> 00:52:45.515]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:52:58.334 --> 00:52:59.535]  Hear that?
[00:52:59.535 --> 00:53:04.917]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:07.858]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:53:07.858 --> 00:53:11.399]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.

[00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:53.841]  There is only One Silver Solution.
[00:54:13.464 --> 00:54:25.429]  The LA Times reported two years ago, when the FBI released their unified crime statistics, very quietly, that crime using guns had dropped 52% since 1992.
[00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:37.346]  And of course, school mass shootings had actually dropped some as well, but it stayed relatively flat overall.
[00:54:37.346 --> 00:54:48.813]  That's why it then came out two weeks ago that the FBI was put under pressure to try to cook those numbers, and so those numbers are meant to make guns look bad, and that gun crime actually dropped even more.
[00:54:48.813 --> 00:54:51.115]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:54:51.115 --> 00:54:56.599]  Headline, gun crime drops, but public thinks it's up.
[00:54:56.599 --> 00:54:57.379]  LA Times.
[00:54:57.379 --> 00:54:58.540]  That's just one example a minute.
[00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:02.782]  And so, that said, I'm not defending police.
[00:55:02.782 --> 00:55:14.264]  In fact, I'm trying to reform the police, and you don't do that by running around saying, kill the police, like the George Soros-funded groups that just want civil unrest in this country.
[00:55:14.264 --> 00:55:15.964]  I'm not going to play along with it.
[00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:27.126]  You're going to reform the police by explaining to them, most of them already know this, the globalist paradigm of giving them the training, the culture, that will make them enemies of the people, giving them missions that will make them enemies, the fake drug war,
[00:55:28.613 --> 00:55:36.438]  Going after folks for petty crimes like lawn grass in their yard, but letting, you know, big bankers go free and illegal aliens go free.
[00:55:36.438 --> 00:55:38.179]  They don't like it either, on average.
[00:55:38.179 --> 00:55:45.684]  But then the bad cops get protected by the corruption, and then that comes out in the media, demonizing the police in general.
[00:55:46.505 --> 00:55:47.666]  I've looked at the numbers.
[00:55:47.666 --> 00:55:51.728]  Actual police brutality and shootings are flat or down.
[00:55:51.728 --> 00:56:00.113]  You got twice as much, and we can pull these numbers up for listeners, just type in, more whites killed statistically than blacks by police.
[00:56:00.113 --> 00:56:04.795]  And for every hundred whites, more are shot by cops than blacks statistically.
[00:56:04.795 --> 00:56:07.257]  You wouldn't think that watching the media.
[00:56:07.257 --> 00:56:09.018]  Now some of them are justified, some of them aren't.
[00:56:11.374 --> 00:56:18.959]  We've had an Austin cop famously, you know, guy gets out of his car with a cell phone, white guy, no criminal record, middle-aged, cop shoots him, thinks it's a gun.
[00:56:18.959 --> 00:56:21.842]  That person shouldn't be a cop, they're so scared.
[00:56:21.842 --> 00:56:23.703]  Last time I heard, I think they fired that cop.
[00:56:23.703 --> 00:56:28.126]  The point, I know they were firing him last time I heard, I don't know if that's official yet.
[00:56:28.126 --> 00:56:32.269]  The point is, is that the world's not perfect.
[00:56:32.269 --> 00:56:37.333]  You're gonna have shootings, you're gonna have crazy pilots crashing planes, you're going to have bad cops.
[00:56:38.669 --> 00:56:44.774]  And no amount of reform from the top's gonna fix it, because the globals don't want to fix anything.
[00:56:44.774 --> 00:56:47.356]  That's what I'm getting at here.
[00:56:47.356 --> 00:56:51.420]  South Carolina officer is charged with murder of Walter Scott.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:56.244]  The guy pulls over the Mercedes, got a broken taillight, shoots the guy in the back.
[00:56:56.244 --> 00:57:00.348]  It's all on video from about 40 yards away.
[00:57:00.348 --> 00:57:03.751]  Roll the video in the background for radio listeners, for TV viewers.
[00:57:03.751 --> 00:57:04.791]  And then he drops a taser.
[00:57:05.854 --> 00:57:07.355]  Right beside him.
[00:57:07.355 --> 00:57:09.738]  And then claims the guy tried to take his taser away.
[00:57:09.738 --> 00:57:12.760]  That's premeditated cover-up.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.844]  So you could say he did it out of fear or hysteria or whatever and get a manslaughter.
[00:57:16.844 --> 00:57:19.747]  Now it's got to be capital murder, folks.
[00:57:19.747 --> 00:57:22.169]  Because then he sets him up and tries to cover up.
[00:57:22.169 --> 00:57:23.110]  That looks cold-blooded.
[00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:26.853]  Now he shoots him in the back.
[00:57:26.853 --> 00:57:28.375]  And then thinks, oh my God, what have I done?
[00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:34.633]  We just don't need a bunch of psychopaths or cowards.
[00:57:34.633 --> 00:57:36.155]  It's a mix as police.
[00:57:36.155 --> 00:57:37.696]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:57:37.696 --> 00:57:41.440]  I mean, the guy runs away and you're too lazy to chase him, you just shoot him in the back?
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.982]  Or you don't just call another squad car or helicopter?
[00:57:43.982 --> 00:57:47.926]  This is crazy town.
[00:57:47.926 --> 00:57:54.552]  And there are some people even defending this cop, but he got caught trying to frame him, and I tell you, that's sick.
[00:57:54.552 --> 00:57:55.894]  But the bigger problem
[00:57:57.034 --> 00:58:09.201]  Is the revenuers like the home inspectors and the agenda 21 people and the so-called pet police that will now grab your cat out of your backyard and charge you 500 bucks to get it back or they kill the cat.
[00:58:09.201 --> 00:58:12.202]  There's an article on InfoWars.com on that.
[00:58:12.202 --> 00:58:24.469]  And then even bigger is the DEA, admittedly, for 50 plus years recording everything you do, basically tracking everything you do and creating whole trees of who you call and who you associate with
[00:58:25.663 --> 00:58:26.723]  For their fake drug war.
[00:58:26.723 --> 00:58:27.783]  That's sick.
[00:58:27.783 --> 00:58:35.885]  So I'm against the drug war, I'm against militarization of police, but I'm not gonna play the game to complete their militarization and now have this civil war with the police.
[00:58:35.885 --> 00:58:36.725]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:36.725 --> 00:58:39.686]  But again, Big Brother caught up with this cop, didn't he?
[00:58:39.686 --> 00:58:41.667]  He didn't get away with this murder.
[00:58:41.667 --> 00:58:43.987]  He'll probably get off with 5-10 years in prison.
[00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:46.208]  He needs to be given a death penalty.
[00:58:46.208 --> 00:58:47.888]  It's a premeditated murder and a setup.
[00:58:49.867 --> 00:58:51.188]  In the near future.
[00:58:51.188 --> 00:58:55.710]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:56.930]  Security alert.
[00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:58.931]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:58:58.931 --> 00:58:59.812]  Analysis.
[00:58:59.812 --> 00:59:00.532]  InfoWars.
[00:59:00.532 --> 00:59:02.513]  Building independent media operations.
[00:59:02.513 --> 00:59:07.516]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:59:07.516 --> 00:59:08.556]  Crime Directive.
[00:59:08.556 --> 00:59:10.097]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:59:10.097 --> 00:59:12.958]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:16.200]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.361]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:18.561 --> 00:59:20.022]  These people are assaulting us!
[00:59:20.022 --> 00:59:22.843]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:22.843 --> 00:59:24.804]  They are never going to stop.
[00:59:24.804 --> 00:59:28.846]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:59:38.791 --> 00:59:43.293]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:43.293 --> 00:59:44.894]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:59:44.894 --> 00:59:45.634]  You can feel it.
[00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:53.927]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.815 --> 01:00:06.115]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.115 --> 01:00:07.876]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.876 --> 01:00:09.636]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.636 --> 01:00:11.197]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.197 --> 01:00:12.777]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:16.958]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:23.059]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.059 --> 01:00:24.520]  Bad boys, bad boys.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.460]  What you gonna do?
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.681]  What you gonna do when the cameras come for you?
[01:00:28.681 --> 01:00:31.401]  Yeah, he's been indicted for murder.
[01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:34.202]  South Carolina officer charged with murder of Walter Scott.
[01:00:35.546 --> 01:00:39.550]  And the usual suspects are running around attacking the police in general.
[01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:47.036]  That's like saying there's a black guy that kills a white person, all blacks are to blame, or because the Klan kills some black person, all whites are to blame.
[01:00:47.036 --> 01:00:53.702]  Again, it's more divide and conquer, which will put the police in their own gang mentality, the public in their own gang mentality.
[01:00:53.702 --> 01:00:57.105]  That's where the globalists want us in their divide and conquer strategy.
[01:00:57.105 --> 01:01:00.689]  But I tell you, if the cop wouldn't have tried to plant the taser on him,
[01:01:02.233 --> 01:01:09.455]  He could have said, I feared for my life, adrenaline got away from me, I thought they were turning back, I thought he had a gun in his hand, but no.
[01:01:09.455 --> 01:01:12.015]  Then he just got kicked off the force.
[01:01:12.015 --> 01:01:16.156]  Now he is gonna get prison time.
[01:01:16.156 --> 01:01:17.696]  Better get prison time.
[01:01:17.696 --> 01:01:23.077]  And I'm sorry, you know, if you shot a cop in the back like this, you'd get the death penalty.
[01:01:23.077 --> 01:01:27.398]  And I just think there'll be respect for the police again when there's fairness again.
[01:01:27.398 --> 01:01:29.919]  But I sure don't want my son or my father shot in the back.
[01:01:32.947 --> 01:01:35.249]  Guys, I forget the statistics came out from the Feds.
[01:01:35.249 --> 01:01:38.811]  Will you pull up that article from about three months ago?
[01:01:38.811 --> 01:01:43.734]  It had the headline, whites and Hispanics more likely to be shot by police than blacks.
[01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:52.040]  Because I want to show people those numbers, not just quote them from memory, because that's the fundamental issue here is, and we should come in with John Bowne's piece.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.681]  I said I'd get into his Phoenix report.
[01:01:53.681 --> 01:01:54.642]  We'll do that in the next segment.
[01:01:54.642 --> 01:01:56.683]  I got behind.
[01:01:56.683 --> 01:02:00.086]  We should do that John Bowne intro that he did a few years ago when they came out with the
[01:02:03.749 --> 01:02:06.270]  It's one of the Motley Crue music, yeah.
[01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:09.112]  The Live Wire.
[01:02:09.112 --> 01:02:19.056]  Paralleling Death Race 2000 with David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone, an excellent B-movie, on a dystopic future.
[01:02:19.056 --> 01:02:25.559]  And in it, you get bonuses for wiping out men, women, and children, and the elderly.
[01:02:26.547 --> 01:02:31.771]  And then you have these no compromise targets that Homeland Security bought two million dollars worth of.
[01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:34.132]  And the company said, look, Homeland Security asked for it.
[01:02:34.132 --> 01:02:40.997]  Women and children, you know, little kids, people in the shower, no hesitation targets.
[01:02:40.997 --> 01:02:47.262]  And yeah, in Vietnam, they started having these basically video games for the troops to instinctively shoot.
[01:02:47.262 --> 01:02:53.827]  And it made people go from 50 percent of the time pulling the trigger up close to about 100 percent or 95 percent.
[01:02:53.827 --> 01:02:55.388]  Now, with instinctive shooting training,
[01:02:56.834 --> 01:02:58.415]  And I've done it.
[01:02:58.415 --> 01:03:08.401]  Back when I used to be into guns big, before we even had a radio show, I used to go out and those police shooting contests that quote civilians to be part of, and if you wanted to win, you just don't think when the targets pop up.
[01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:15.686]  You shoot the bad guys, you go through the obstacle course, and I used to get in the top 10, 20 percentile, even though I only did it six or seven times.
[01:03:15.686 --> 01:03:19.188]  The cops used to get so mad when like an 18 year old was beating them.
[01:03:19.188 --> 01:03:21.630]  But I had better reflexes, obviously.
[01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:22.631]  Now I'd be terrible at it.
[01:03:23.151 --> 01:03:25.132]  Compared to when I was 18.
[01:03:25.132 --> 01:03:33.337]  But, that's why soldiers are better when they're young, because your reflexes are so fast, and you're stupid, and don't think you can die, which also helps.
[01:03:33.337 --> 01:03:48.266]  But, it's easy to second guess the police, because they're going to make a lot of mistakes, but you start giving them instinctive shooting, reflex shooting training.
[01:03:48.266 --> 01:03:50.988]  I mean, somebody gets out of their car with a cell phone in their wallet, boom!
[01:03:52.568 --> 01:04:02.076]  I mean they're shootin' old ladies, they're shootin' black people, they're shootin' Hispanics, they're... The black cops are shootin' white people, whites are shootin' blacks, blacks are shootin' blacks.
[01:04:02.076 --> 01:04:07.060]  You've seen the footage comes out all the time of a black cop shootin' black guy.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.462]  And you know, you'll see some guy run or start wrestling in L.A.
[01:04:09.462 --> 01:04:11.104]  and the black cop shoots him.
[01:04:11.104 --> 01:04:12.745]  And that's not a big issue because it's a black guy.
[01:04:12.745 --> 01:04:20.792]  I mean... It's a very serious situation out there.
[01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.830]  To say the least.
[01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:36.297]  But, uh, where it becomes somebody being hysterical or having buck fever... And again, that's what it's called when you go hunting and shoot a cow because you say it looks like a deer.
[01:04:36.297 --> 01:04:37.718]  There are people you take hunting for the first time.
[01:04:37.718 --> 01:04:41.500]  They could be an executive, they could be a lawyer, they could be a really smart, competent person.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:46.663]  You put them out on a deer stand, the sun comes up, and 500 yards away on somebody else's property, they shoot a cow.
[01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:49.020]  Because it had horns.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.422]  They thought they were antlers.
[01:04:50.422 --> 01:04:52.265]  And it's the same thing with a lot of these cops.
[01:04:52.265 --> 01:04:54.189]  They're just ready to kill somebody.
[01:04:54.189 --> 01:04:57.775]  Not even because they're psychopaths, but because they're trained to pull that gun and pull that trigger.

[01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:53.379]  Silver Bullet.
[01:06:58.291 --> 01:06:59.612]  The experts are clear.
[01:06:59.612 --> 01:07:06.718]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:07:06.718 --> 01:07:13.004]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:07:13.004 --> 01:07:16.587]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:07:16.727 --> 01:07:20.931]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:07:20.931 --> 01:07:26.255]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:27.276]  Not our iodine.
[01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:33.622]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:07:43.931 --> 01:07:46.673]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:46.673 --> 01:07:48.393]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:20.027]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:20.027 --> 01:08:20.607]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:20.607 --> 01:08:21.889]  Central Standard Time.
[01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:23.131]  We're here live.
[01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:25.874]  I'm your host Alex Jones on this Wednesday edition.
[01:08:25.874 --> 01:08:30.259]  We'll be back tonight 7 o'clock Central with InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:08:30.259 --> 01:08:33.783]  Here's what I want to do ahead of a special guest joining us.
[01:08:35.072 --> 01:08:47.740]  In the third hour today, Jerry Peterman, who heads up FukushimaUpdateReport.com, interviews the scientists, the folks on the ground, the people at the universities doing the testing.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.043]  We're going to be looking at mainstream news coming out.
[01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:58.668]  Fukushima radiation has reached North American shores, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution says.
[01:08:58.668 --> 01:09:03.371]  Well, it's been reaching here, but now the actual sea debris is slamming in.
[01:09:04.929 --> 01:09:07.471]  And what we're going to do is review the fact that this is a whitewash.
[01:09:07.471 --> 01:09:15.819]  In fact, will you guys reprint me the stuff from two years ago about the tuna off San Diego with three times the safe level of cesium in it and stuff like that?
[01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:18.421]  The milk in Vermont.
[01:09:19.834 --> 01:09:25.556]  With the cesium and other isotopes in it, because I want to really show you the anatomy of a whitewash.
[01:09:25.556 --> 01:09:27.177]  And I'm not trying to scare folks.
[01:09:27.177 --> 01:09:32.539]  The northern hemisphere had double the radiation from nuclear testing and from Chernobyl in 86.
[01:09:32.539 --> 01:09:36.100]  It's now basically triple.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:41.802]  And we have those readings as well from the federal government and from Europe.
[01:09:41.802 --> 01:09:43.563]  So, what changed?
[01:09:43.563 --> 01:09:44.743]  Why don't they care anymore?
[01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:51.033]  Simply amazing.
[01:09:51.033 --> 01:09:56.717]  Democrats says IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns.
[01:09:56.717 --> 01:10:00.680]  That ties into some huge illegal DEA news.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.282]  And it ties into South Carolina officers charged with murder of Walter Scott.
[01:10:04.282 --> 01:10:06.323]  Shoots the person in the back for no reason.
[01:10:06.323 --> 01:10:12.027]  Plants a taser on him and claims that he tried to take the taser away.
[01:10:12.027 --> 01:10:13.809]  Premeditated.
[01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:14.629]  Frame up.
[01:10:14.629 --> 01:10:15.690]  Super evil.
[01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:21.882]  Super corrupt.
[01:10:21.882 --> 01:10:27.647]  And he got caught because somebody was videotaping it.
[01:10:27.647 --> 01:10:39.396]  We'll also get into that article I mentioned with the statistics on cops are more likely to shoot whites or others over blacks.
[01:10:39.396 --> 01:10:43.759]  Two to one study shows.
[01:10:43.759 --> 01:10:46.802]  Just to shatter this myth that the cops are out there hunting black people.
[01:10:47.685 --> 01:10:55.090]  No, the cops aren't responding in inner city black areas because they don't want to be set up and they don't want to lose their jobs.
[01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.172]  That's really the tragedy here.
[01:10:57.172 --> 01:11:05.658]  Black cops in Southside Chicago have some of the slowest response times out there because they don't want to be in the middle of it.
[01:11:05.658 --> 01:11:08.940]  So those are the facts we're going to get to it.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.222]  Huge news with Dick Cheney coming out.
[01:11:11.222 --> 01:11:12.183]  We played the clip earlier.
[01:11:13.507 --> 01:11:21.274]  The clips on Infowars.com says President Obama wants to take America down.
[01:11:21.274 --> 01:11:27.159]  And sure, I would say Dick Cheney was taking the Bill of Rights and Constitution down and was terrible.
[01:11:27.159 --> 01:11:29.982]  And Obama used many of his power grabs to power grab as well.
[01:11:32.742 --> 01:11:51.097]  But it is true that Obama, whether it's devaluing the dollar, or whether it's not blocking the Chinese investment bank, or whether it is shelling us out to Al-Qaeda, or whether it's attacking and shutting down our power plants, I mean, George Bush didn't do that.
[01:11:51.097 --> 01:11:57.943]  Carbon taxes, you name it, if I wanted to shut America down and annihilate the working class, the middle class, this is exactly what I'd do.
[01:12:02.034 --> 01:12:05.236]  So we're going to be going over all of that coming up.
[01:12:05.236 --> 01:12:16.222]  But first off, to understand where military drills like Jade Helm will be conducted in August and September.
[01:12:16.222 --> 01:12:26.388]  If you want to understand where stuff like that comes from and why we're concerned, it's because they'll have a lot of legitimate decontamination drills, dirty bomb drills, which they're now announcing for the public consumption.
[01:12:27.193 --> 01:12:42.545]  But the nighttime drills, the practice taking over courthouses and police stations and capitals and things like that is, in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, to crush the states and legislatures or governors that are in rebellion.
[01:12:42.545 --> 01:12:44.407]  It says that.
[01:12:44.407 --> 01:12:50.832]  So it is a Lincoln-esque move to block the states if they try to block a treasonous federal takeover.
[01:12:52.008 --> 01:12:55.150]  And the federal government itself has been seized by the globalists.
[01:12:55.150 --> 01:13:11.981]  And if you want to understand Delta Force and the Navy SEALs and all these snatch-and-grab, door-kicking operations, where their number one enemy domestically, they're told in the public documents, this isn't even secret now, so there's no denying it, veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, pro-lifers.
[01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:14.923]  They've now added evangelicals.
[01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:16.764]  I mean, evangelicals are really nice people.
[01:13:18.126 --> 01:13:20.429]  I was brought up quasi-evangelical.
[01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:22.611]  I went to some evangelical churches.
[01:13:22.611 --> 01:13:29.839]  Amongst Southern Baptists and Methodists, stuff like that, we went to a lot of different churches.
[01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:35.064]  But that's about as government-worshipping as you're gonna get going along with the system as evangelicals.
[01:13:35.064 --> 01:13:38.088]  They think the end of the world's any minute, so just go along with it.
[01:13:38.088 --> 01:13:38.869]  But that shows
[01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:44.693]  How they hate the faith itself and the love of Jesus Christ.
[01:13:44.693 --> 01:13:48.375]  Because any deity can be above the government and above the state.
[01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:51.397]  And if your rights come from God, they can't come from
[01:13:52.881 --> 01:13:57.503]  Kim Jong Un, who the North Koreans pray for their lunches for.
[01:13:57.503 --> 01:14:02.286]  And in Venezuela, I didn't believe it five years ago when a Venezuelan programmer I know told me.
[01:14:02.286 --> 01:14:03.747]  I believed him, but I couldn't believe it.
[01:14:03.747 --> 01:14:09.910]  Then it came out in mainstream news that on TV, they have morning prayers on their equivalent of Sesame Street.
[01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:11.591]  They got a puppet show.
[01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:18.915]  This was in mainstream news, where they pray to the current president and to the dead saint
[01:14:20.964 --> 01:14:21.684]  Because now he's dead.
[01:14:21.684 --> 01:14:25.145]  Back then they would pray to Chavez to get their milk.
[01:14:25.145 --> 01:14:27.506]  Max Cabrera did a lot of programming work for us.
[01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:31.887]  And his parents had a big private school there until the government took it over.
[01:14:31.887 --> 01:14:34.688]  He talked about his dad just refused.
[01:14:34.688 --> 01:14:35.868]  And then he was worried about persecution.
[01:14:35.868 --> 01:14:36.889]  He didn't want me to say his name.
[01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:39.009]  But later he said, I could.
[01:14:39.009 --> 01:14:40.930]  And I mean, they told him, his dad.
[01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.350]  And his dad said, I am not going to have the kids pray to Chavez.
[01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:45.471]  And then they would have them pray to Christ.
[01:14:45.471 --> 01:14:47.272]  And then they wouldn't get the milk and cereal.
[01:14:47.272 --> 01:14:48.412]  These are hungry kids.
[01:14:51.258 --> 01:14:58.283]  And then, they would pray to Chavez and get the milk and the Rice Krispies, basically.
[01:14:58.283 --> 01:15:00.304]  I mean, this is brainwashing, people!
[01:15:00.304 --> 01:15:03.366]  I'm not gonna worship some commie!
[01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:05.948]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:15:05.948 --> 01:15:16.836]  Special report on Project Phoenix.
[01:15:16.836 --> 01:15:18.217]  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[01:15:19.338 --> 01:15:27.664]  Over the past several weeks, you have heard a number of reports on TV, radio, and in your newspapers on the situation in Southeast Asia.
[01:15:27.664 --> 01:15:35.129]  I think the time has come for me as President, and as Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces, to put these reports in perspective.
[01:15:35.749 --> 01:15:55.719]  Tactics used during the Vietnam War by the CIA and the military eerily echo the current establishment's build-up of Stasi-style homeland security and that their declaration that the greatest threat to national security is sovereign patriotic citizens, not the thousands of criminals crossing our southern border, murdering and raping American citizens,
[01:15:55.959 --> 01:16:00.822]  Not the Islamic terrorist organizations that have been embedded in the United States for decades.
[01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:07.646]  Among those variety of reasons, radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals took the steps that they did.
[01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:08.767]  You say radical Islam.
[01:16:08.767 --> 01:16:17.152]  I mean, I think those people who espouse a version of Islam that is not... Are you uncomfortable attributing any of their actions to radical Islam?
[01:16:17.152 --> 01:16:17.752]  It sounds like it.
[01:16:17.932 --> 01:16:25.096]  I don't want to say anything negative about a religion that is... I'm not talking about radical Islam.
[01:16:25.096 --> 01:16:27.518]  I'm not talking about the general religion.
[01:16:27.518 --> 01:16:33.481]  No, real constitution-loving, apple pie-eating Americans are the number one threat to their own country.
[01:16:33.481 --> 01:16:35.342]  And 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:16:35.342 --> 01:16:38.264]  How and why is that declaration even rational?
[01:16:38.744 --> 01:16:42.046]  Vietnam, 1965 to 1972.
[01:16:42.046 --> 01:16:50.650]  The Phoenix Program, a CIA-designed and coordinated infiltration of the political infrastructure of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, a.k.a.
[01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:52.511]  the Viet Cong Communist Army.
[01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:57.194]  Force must often precede reason, and the waste of war
[01:16:58.582 --> 01:17:00.044]  The works of peace.
[01:17:00.044 --> 01:17:06.129]  The CIA had been covertly infiltrating Viet Cong strongholds to seek out names on their kill list.
[01:17:06.129 --> 01:17:15.478]  One of the tactics included parading innocent Vietnamese citizens around their village with a bag over their head and a leash around their neck, terrorizing all of the residents.
[01:17:15.758 --> 01:17:22.546]  The Vietnamese citizen on the leash would then be instructed to indicate which house the Viet Cong informer might live.
[01:17:22.546 --> 01:17:30.335]  The next day, the CIA's Provincial Reconnaissance Units would kick the door down and kill everyone inside, women and children included.
[01:17:30.735 --> 01:17:41.741]  The CIA's PRU would haul the Viet Cong off to regional interrogation centers where they would be tortured to extract information for the commanding officers, and then the whole process would be repeated.
[01:17:41.741 --> 01:17:50.086]  The Phoenix program neutralized 81,740 Viet Cong operatives, killing between 26,000 and 41,000 of them.
[01:17:50.086 --> 01:17:55.169]  Peter Da Silva, the CIA's station chief, developed a strategy known as counter-terror.
[01:17:55.169 --> 01:17:59.411]  The use of terrorism as a legitimate tool to use in unconventional warfare.
[01:17:59.751 --> 01:18:05.877]  De Silva strategically applied the counter-terror to unsuspecting, quote, enemy civilians, unquote.
[01:18:05.877 --> 01:18:15.147]  Historian Douglas Valentine noted in his important work, The Phoenix Program, that central to Phoenix is the fact that it targeted civilians, not soldiers.
[01:18:15.587 --> 01:18:25.409]  Innocent victims of Castro's rounding up of 200,000 citizens during the CIA's Bay of Pigs invasion can't help but see the implications of similar operations inside the United States.
[01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:39.572]  After witnessing troops training to intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the upcoming Jade Helm operation from July through September of 2015 states that troops will operate undetected amongst civilian populations.
[01:18:40.052 --> 01:18:44.137]  To see if they can infiltrate without being noticed.
[01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:53.547]  With martial law plans that have been in place for decades, the globalist bankers that control our government see the CIA's approach in Vietnam as a benchmark in undermining U.S.
[01:18:53.547 --> 01:18:54.048]  sovereignty.
[01:18:55.289 --> 01:19:03.252]  14 years since 9-11 unleashing a degradation in the American Bill of Rights never before seen in our 239 year history.
[01:19:03.252 --> 01:19:08.314]  The fall of Saigon in 1975 marked the end of the Vietnam War.
[01:19:08.314 --> 01:19:12.255]  Communism won and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was born.
[01:19:12.255 --> 01:19:16.577]  The CIA lost the Vietnam War by targeting the citizenry.
[01:19:17.097 --> 01:19:26.013]  With the Jade Helm operations gearing up for the summer of 2015, treason's seat at the Table of Liberty just got a whole lot bigger.
[01:19:26.013 --> 01:19:28.296]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[01:19:29.361 --> 01:19:30.341]  Great job, John Bowne.
[01:19:30.341 --> 01:19:32.262]  That was on last night's InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:19:32.262 --> 01:19:33.062]  That's what you're missing.
[01:19:33.062 --> 01:19:36.203]  That's just four minutes of the 30-minute transmission.
[01:19:36.203 --> 01:19:37.183]  Here's the deal.
[01:19:37.183 --> 01:19:38.724]  They didn't really lose Vietnam.
[01:19:38.724 --> 01:19:39.964]  They wouldn't let them bomb the North.
[01:19:39.964 --> 01:19:42.044]  They wouldn't let them take out the harbors.
[01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:43.265]  They wouldn't let them mine them.
[01:19:43.265 --> 01:19:46.326]  It was about making money and destabilizing things.
[01:19:46.326 --> 01:19:53.668]  And if the globalists can start a civil war here and lose it, they don't care because they'll make trillions off of the war.
[01:19:53.668 --> 01:19:57.529]  So if the globalists couldn't take Vietnam, they sure can't take over America if 1% fight back.
[01:19:58.888 --> 01:20:05.894]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[01:20:58.126 --> 01:21:00.948]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:00.948 --> 01:21:06.071]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:06.071 --> 01:21:14.197]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:14.197 --> 01:21:18.719]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:22.522]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:22.682 --> 01:21:28.627]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:28.627 --> 01:21:31.790]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:37.174]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:37.174 --> 01:21:45.181]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:21:48.744 --> 01:22:01.936]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:01.936 --> 01:22:02.556]  It's true.
[01:22:02.556 --> 01:22:06.720]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.102]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.102 --> 01:22:13.586]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:13.886 --> 01:22:26.751]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:30.553]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.

[01:22:37.515 --> 01:22:41.797]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.781]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:23:29.781 --> 01:23:34.082]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:23:34.082 --> 01:23:35.483]  Silverlungs.com.

[01:23:50.968 --> 01:23:54.789]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[01:23:54.789 --> 01:23:56.290]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[01:24:16.327 --> 01:24:18.389]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:18.389 --> 01:24:27.275]  I'm Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, from the Infowars.com News Center.
[01:24:27.275 --> 01:24:44.026]  You see, if you just flip, or not even flip, shift your view to a globalist perspective, it doesn't mean you agree with what they're doing, but if you get into their mindset, then their logic, their wicked logic makes perfect sense and does have an arithmetic that balances out.
[01:24:45.851 --> 01:24:47.652]  In a very nasty way.
[01:24:47.652 --> 01:24:49.493]  People say, why weren't we allowed to win Vietnam?
[01:24:49.493 --> 01:24:54.376]  Why for 10 years couldn't we bomb the North or attack the harbor or mine it?
[01:24:56.138 --> 01:25:03.960]  Because they were making hundreds of billions of dollars a year, that's the equivalent of trillions and trillions a year, on the Vietnam War.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:16.784]  They were using the dialectic to grow the leftist movement as the opposition with Time Magazine and Newsweek and Life, promoting Hillary Clinton and John Kerry as saviors, as the new political class.
[01:25:16.784 --> 01:25:23.326]  They wanted to control revolution in the country, so they created a war to discredit America.
[01:25:25.322 --> 01:25:29.545]  That's why we do business with Vietnam now and they're not a communist state, basically.
[01:25:29.545 --> 01:25:31.706]  They're communist in name only.
[01:25:31.706 --> 01:25:36.389]  Now the Vietnamese are having a war with the Chinese.
[01:25:36.389 --> 01:25:38.431]  Oh yeah, for a year, they got a war going.
[01:25:38.431 --> 01:25:40.572]  They're not calling it a war, but it's a war.
[01:25:40.572 --> 01:25:42.193]  On the ocean and on the land.
[01:25:42.193 --> 01:25:47.797]  They border China.
[01:25:47.797 --> 01:25:52.760]  And so we fed 58,000 Americans, 200 plus thousand wounded, millions of dead Vietnamese,
[01:25:54.363 --> 01:25:57.606]  When Ho Chi Minh wanted to work with the U.S.
[01:25:57.606 --> 01:26:06.673]  and wanted to kick the communist out, and then we wouldn't work with him because he wouldn't let the French run all the schmack out of the country.
[01:26:06.673 --> 01:26:13.698]  He wanted to develop an economy based on industry, and they said, no buddy, we're gonna ship heroin out of your country.
[01:26:13.698 --> 01:26:16.200]  And he said, no you're not.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.421]  It's all on record.
[01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:19.643]  So they said, watch this.
[01:26:19.643 --> 01:26:22.425]  We're gonna squat on the South and ship it out.
[01:26:23.621 --> 01:26:29.626]  And keep you from shipping it out, and we're gonna make money on the weapons at the same time.
[01:26:29.626 --> 01:26:38.433]  And we're gonna fill the caskets, declassified, full of heroin.
[01:26:38.433 --> 01:26:48.101]  And then we're gonna make movies blaming one black guy for it, and Denzel Washington will star in it.
[01:26:48.101 --> 01:26:51.944]  That's what all of this is really all about, boys and girls.
[01:26:54.898 --> 01:27:06.323]  I want to open the phones up in the next segment on the huge military developments, on the situation with Fukushima, on this.
[01:27:06.323 --> 01:27:10.605]  House Bill bans fake guns, not real guns, near schools.
[01:27:10.605 --> 01:27:13.266]  See, there's no lobby to protect Nerf guns.
[01:27:13.266 --> 01:27:15.867]  So they can ban that, then ban the real thing.
[01:27:15.867 --> 01:27:19.188]  First you ban the words, you ban the image, then you ban the real thing.
[01:27:19.188 --> 01:27:22.410]  That's what political correctness is all about.
[01:27:22.410 --> 01:27:23.250]  That's out of the Tennessean.
[01:27:26.496 --> 01:27:32.180]  And then that ties into this article I mentioned earlier, but I want to get to now.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:36.043]  Democrats, IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns.
[01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:40.306]  This is the new model of where we'll forgive your tax debts, just turn your guns in.
[01:27:40.306 --> 01:27:48.273]  A Democrat lawmaker is going to introduce a bill next week designed to relieve Americans of burdensome taxes in exchange for their boom-booms.
[01:27:49.121 --> 01:27:50.141]  Let's have a BISPAC review.
[01:27:50.141 --> 01:27:55.483]  A Democrat lawmaker is going to introduce a bill next week designed to relieve Americans of burdensome taxes in exchange for their guns.
[01:27:55.483 --> 01:28:04.506]  Representative Rosa Del Loro of Connecticut, a Democrat, is introducing the bill to support assault firearms elimination and education.
[01:28:04.506 --> 01:28:05.946]  I thought you didn't want to ban the guns.
[01:28:05.946 --> 01:28:07.627]  Oh, you want to eliminate them, though.
[01:28:07.627 --> 01:28:13.348]  An Education of Our Streets Act that will offer tax credits of $2,000 for those who choose to turn in their weapons.
[01:28:13.348 --> 01:28:14.769]  All of them to local police.
[01:28:14.769 --> 01:28:15.369]  How's that sound?
[01:28:16.308 --> 01:28:20.690]  And see, they're just going to keep raising taxes until you've got to turn your guns in or you'll go bankrupt.
[01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:25.033]  But don't worry, if you're a big global bank, you're tax-exempt.
[01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:29.615]  Or if you're illegal aliens, oh, I'm not supposed to use that word, sorry, you said so, you don't have to pay the taxes.
[01:28:29.615 --> 01:28:33.497]  I mean, it's just a monumental takeover.
[01:28:33.497 --> 01:28:37.720]  And that's the power to tax is the power to destroy, as George Washington said.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.361]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:28:40.361 --> 01:28:45.544]  If McDonald's and 2,000-plus companies get a waiver four years ago on Obamacare,
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:29:04.226]  They don't have to get it, but your hamburger shop that doesn't have GMO, that isn't full of crud, you actually pay your employees decent, your burgers taste a lot better, but they cost more because they're not cardboard, and then you gotta get everybody insurance, what happens?
[01:29:04.226 --> 01:29:06.006]  Your burger is $10, McDonald's is $2!
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.042]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:29:16.042 --> 01:29:22.148]  And then you raise taxes and regulations so high, poor people can't afford the $10 hamburger!
[01:29:22.148 --> 01:29:23.830]  Because beef prices have doubled.
[01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:32.339]  They gotta eat some frankincrud made out of silly putty or whatever from Mickey D's!
[01:29:33.519 --> 01:29:35.500]  The circle is now complete.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:38.021]  Bondage through economic warfare.
[01:29:38.021 --> 01:29:39.322]  Siege.
[01:29:39.322 --> 01:29:43.224]  And now the great enemy is any farm, any ranch, any independent community.
[01:29:43.224 --> 01:29:45.425]  The answer is get independent, get local now.
[01:29:45.425 --> 01:29:46.125]  Stay with us.
[01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.166]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.166 --> 01:29:49.567]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.567 --> 01:29:50.828]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.828 --> 01:29:55.330]  We're gonna play that Barney Miller versus David Rockefeller piece.
[01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:56.270]  It's been augmented.
[01:29:59.059 --> 01:30:08.725]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:08.725 --> 01:30:18.650]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:21.572]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:24.814]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[01:30:24.814 --> 01:30:29.017]  Oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:30:29.017 --> 01:30:33.700]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:36.122]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[01:30:36.122 --> 01:30:38.683]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:44.347]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:30:44.347 --> 01:30:49.711]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology.
[01:30:49.711 --> 01:30:51.612]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com
[01:30:51.932 --> 01:30:55.175]  Or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[01:30:55.175 --> 01:30:58.418]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:30:58.418 --> 01:31:04.102]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:31:04.102 --> 01:31:10.228]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:31:10.228 --> 01:31:13.270]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:15.012]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[01:31:15.012 --> 01:31:18.575]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:31:18.575 --> 01:31:20.156]  No needles, no injections.
[01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:25.938]  Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:25.938 --> 01:31:27.398]  Alex Jones here.
[01:31:27.398 --> 01:31:38.842]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:31:39.122 --> 01:31:42.925]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:31:42.925 --> 01:31:51.253]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:31:51.253 --> 01:31:53.575]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:53.575 --> 01:31:54.616]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:58.719 --> 01:32:00.680]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:04.922]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:32:04.922 --> 01:32:09.384]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:32:09.384 --> 01:32:16.128]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:32:16.668 --> 01:32:25.970]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:31.512]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:39.114]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:32:39.114 --> 01:32:41.695]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:32:41.695 --> 01:32:43.475]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge,
[01:32:43.615 --> 01:32:45.315]  Cam, this is William Klein.
[01:32:45.315 --> 01:32:47.236]  He was wrecking an office.
[01:32:47.236 --> 01:32:48.956]  I just wanted to meet them face-to-face.
[01:32:48.956 --> 01:32:51.377]  I wanted them to admit what they were doing.
[01:32:51.377 --> 01:32:51.937]  Who is they?
[01:32:51.937 --> 01:32:55.058]  He was in the office of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:32:55.058 --> 01:32:56.278]  Trilateral Commission?
[01:33:15.239 --> 01:33:18.568]  Yeah, the Trilateral Commission.
[01:33:18.568 --> 01:33:20.834]  Alright, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:30.076]  The Toronto Commission is a private organization founded by David Rockefeller in 1973.
[01:33:30.076 --> 01:33:38.264]  But you see what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[01:33:38.264 --> 01:33:49.134]  To work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and in time bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller pulling the shots.
[01:33:49.754 --> 01:33:52.376]  Come back, we don't want your new horrors, you know?
[01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:54.297]  Rockefeller, we know what you're doing!
[01:33:54.297 --> 01:33:56.479]  Your new-on-order will never come in!
[01:33:56.479 --> 01:33:57.740]  We're not your slaves.
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:59.120]  We're not your slaves.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.363]  You helped start the Trilateral Commission, and you've been to the Bilderberg groups.
[01:34:03.363 --> 01:34:06.445]  There is such a thing as insidious influence.
[01:34:06.445 --> 01:34:10.368]  I'm telling you, our whole way of life as we know it is in jeopardy!
[01:34:10.368 --> 01:34:11.208]  I appreciate that.
[01:34:11.208 --> 01:34:13.830]  But I have the documented evidence.
[01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:14.451]  It's all in there.
[01:34:14.451 --> 01:34:14.751]  Show him.
[01:34:15.411 --> 01:34:17.672]  It's most notable members include George Bush.
[01:34:17.672 --> 01:34:19.593]  It is a big idea.
[01:34:19.593 --> 01:34:20.913]  A new world order.
[01:34:20.913 --> 01:34:24.274]  Are you happy for the millions of deaths you're part of?
[01:34:24.274 --> 01:34:24.855]  People know.
[01:34:24.855 --> 01:34:27.236]  People are waking up to the reality of this, Mr. Bush.
[01:34:27.236 --> 01:34:29.216]  You piece of sh... Dick Cheney.
[01:34:29.216 --> 01:34:31.917]  I think that what needed to be done was done.
[01:34:31.917 --> 01:34:34.558]  I think that we were perfectly justified in doing it.
[01:34:34.558 --> 01:34:35.879]  And I'd do it again.
[01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:36.579]  What do you got?
[01:34:36.579 --> 01:34:38.000]  What do you got?
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.040]  You gotta figure out... Bill Clinton.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:43.482]  The phrase that I often use myself, that we needed a new world order.
[01:34:43.482 --> 01:34:44.262]  Henry Kissinger.
[01:34:44.562 --> 01:34:48.105]  When really a new world order can be created, it's a great opportunity.
[01:34:48.105 --> 01:34:49.387]  Madeleine, alright.
[01:34:49.387 --> 01:34:51.629]  I think this is a very hard choice.
[01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:53.390]  We think the price is worth it.
[01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:58.095]  Now you remember at the convention, everybody thought it was going to be Ford for Veep.
[01:34:58.095 --> 01:34:59.496]  You know what happened?
[01:34:59.496 --> 01:35:05.562]  David Rockefeller just picked up a phone, put in a call, hey Ronnie, forget Jerry, it's George, bye!
[01:35:07.143 --> 01:35:11.066]  No matter who won in November, they had their man in the White House!
[01:35:11.066 --> 01:35:15.670]  David Rockefeller founded all the major UN groups, their family gave the UN the land.
[01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:17.551]  I mean, this is the global empire.
[01:35:17.551 --> 01:35:22.015]  New World Order is the headline in the Globe and Mail, and is this global governance at last?
[01:35:22.015 --> 01:35:23.035]  Is it one world?
[01:35:23.035 --> 01:35:24.617]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:35:24.617 --> 01:35:33.524]  We are grateful to Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promise of discretion for almost 40 years.
[01:35:34.324 --> 01:35:40.348]  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we would have been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years.
[01:35:40.348 --> 01:35:44.610]  But the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government.
[01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:49.553]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:35:49.553 --> 01:35:53.676]  It's Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:35:53.676 --> 01:35:57.498]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:35:59.633 --> 01:36:15.630]  Well there they were back on mainstream television in the early 1980s making fun of people, talking about the Trilateral Commission and everything they said in that Barney Miller piece is absolutely true.
[01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:20.235]  But then all the newsmen in the TV show get to laugh at it.
[01:36:21.803 --> 01:36:33.667]  Hey, you know, the Trilateral Commission has a plan to create three global groups, transfer sovereignty to them, and then set up tyrannies where they're going to micromanage every facet of our lives and raise taxes so high we all go bankrupt.
[01:36:33.667 --> 01:36:34.987]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:36:34.987 --> 01:36:36.568]  No, no, here they wrote books saying it.
[01:36:36.568 --> 01:36:37.208]  They're doing it.
[01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.769]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:36:38.769 --> 01:36:39.829]  It's so funny.
[01:36:39.829 --> 01:36:42.530]  Now they go, yeah, there's a global government.
[01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.651]  Yeah, it's unelected.
[01:36:44.651 --> 01:36:48.992]  And the veterans and patriots are terrorists and they're going to blow stuff up.
[01:36:48.992 --> 01:36:51.033]  No, you're going to blow stuff up and blame us.
[01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:55.283]  I watched episode 7 of the first season of House of Cards.
[01:36:55.283 --> 01:36:56.964]  Again, I don't watch television.
[01:36:56.964 --> 01:37:00.047]  I should watch more entertainment because that's where the real propaganda is.
[01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:03.710]  We've already discredited mainstream news.
[01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:05.371]  They're in freefall.
[01:37:05.371 --> 01:37:07.072]  And episode, was it 7 or 8?
[01:37:07.072 --> 01:37:09.734]  I watched 2 last night.
[01:37:09.734 --> 01:37:11.676]  It's very well done, House of Cards, obviously.
[01:37:11.676 --> 01:37:16.520]  It's not like I'm telling you something you don't know.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.222]  And, it's all transparent though.
[01:37:20.652 --> 01:37:43.087]  Somebody throws a brick through the congressman's window, and it was so obvious that he diverted the cop so he could do it, and then they are going to blame the cop for not stopping it, and at the end, he tells his opposition, yeah, I did it to trick the opposition into getting mad and punching him in the face so he can threaten him with a felony for attacking a congressman if he doesn't go along with him.
[01:37:43.087 --> 01:37:44.188]  And then he's the good guy.
[01:37:45.717 --> 01:37:49.159]  Everybody watches it and goes, oh, Underwood is so evil.
[01:37:49.159 --> 01:37:52.241]  He's so smart and marvels at it.
[01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:57.864]  And then the real propaganda, his wife runs global water initiatives because she cares about people.
[01:37:57.864 --> 01:38:01.006]  But she's also a crook.
[01:38:01.006 --> 01:38:05.929]  And is so proud of the fact he cheats on her.
[01:38:05.929 --> 01:38:10.492]  And they're going to get some jobs going after shutting down 12,000 jobs.
[01:38:10.492 --> 01:38:13.874]  They're going to get 3,000 jobs in Pennsylvania by running
[01:38:15.011 --> 01:38:24.918]  Their corrupt congressman, who's on cocaine, who they control, and who's compromised, and who sells out people, and he thinks they're helping folks, and one out of 10,000 might know the scam.
[01:38:24.918 --> 01:38:42.752]  She shows the watershed and says, and we'll develop it, environmentally sensitive, so they're the heroes, when that's a real agenda I live under in Austin, that's a global model, to take everybody's private property, not let you use it, force you to sell it, then they turn around and build on it, and then double, triple charge you for water.
[01:38:44.261 --> 01:38:46.422]  I mean, I cut my teeth fighting these people.
[01:38:46.422 --> 01:38:52.505]  I've been to their conferences where they sit up there and rub their hands together and admit it's a criminal operation.
[01:38:52.505 --> 01:38:58.988]  I remember like 16, 17 years ago with my hands, we've got to find those videos, they aired on AXS TV and on the radio.
[01:38:58.988 --> 01:39:04.651]  And I'd walk up to all these mayors and governors, people meeting here at the Smart Growth Conference, interviewed Michael Dell, you name it.
[01:39:05.407 --> 01:39:10.048]  And I walk over and I go, you mean you're just taking private property and developing it and building it and taking it?
[01:39:10.048 --> 01:39:17.230]  And this former Dallas Cowboy, I forget his name, he's famous, he's a white guy, he just goes, get out of my way for a... He goes, of course!
[01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:20.831]  Started laughing at me going, it's about money?
[01:39:20.831 --> 01:39:21.231]  Really?
[01:39:21.231 --> 01:39:22.192]  Tell me something I don't know!
[01:39:22.192 --> 01:39:23.172]  Get out of my way!
[01:39:23.172 --> 01:39:27.693]  And they were just stomping around and I'd go, but this isn't nice!
[01:39:27.693 --> 01:39:29.914]  And they would just go, ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:39:29.914 --> 01:39:32.734]  I got a bunch of it on tape!
[01:39:32.734 --> 01:39:33.995]  They're just like, really?
[01:39:33.995 --> 01:39:34.615]  It's a scam?
[01:39:37.133 --> 01:39:42.537]  I mean, they made the House of Cards guy look like an angel cake.
[01:39:42.537 --> 01:39:44.719]  You think that guy's manipulative in that show?
[01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:51.044]  You ain't seen nothing!
[01:39:51.044 --> 01:39:57.569]  And I just can't believe they have shows where they glorify this type of garbage.
[01:39:57.569 --> 01:40:02.293]  And I was watching The Flying Back From L.A.
[01:40:02.293 --> 01:40:06.797]  Chicago PD and about a special crimes unit where they torture people.
[01:40:08.308 --> 01:40:10.228]  And sure enough, I went and looked at the synopsis of other episodes.
[01:40:10.228 --> 01:40:14.809]  Every episode, it's torturing people, and it's always for the good that they torture people.
[01:40:14.809 --> 01:40:18.190]  And that they cover up evidence, and they do whatever they want because they're the good guys.
[01:40:18.190 --> 01:40:26.232]  I mean, this is pure brainwashing, where they set up these situational ethics where it's good that they do it, but in the real world, it's not good they do it.
[01:40:26.232 --> 01:40:29.893]  And then when a cop sets somebody up, you go to prison.
[01:40:29.893 --> 01:40:31.873]  So, people are taught by television.
[01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:34.712]  I wasn't taught by television.
[01:40:34.712 --> 01:40:41.802]  I was taught by the real world, and by business, and by life, and by the streets, and by being involved, and by acting like a man when I was 14 years old.
[01:40:46.024 --> 01:40:50.266]  And I just thought I was normal at 14 that I wanted to date college girls.
[01:40:50.266 --> 01:40:53.287]  I thought I was normal when I was 14 fighting 18-year-olds.
[01:40:53.287 --> 01:40:56.668]  I thought it was normal that I wanted a 500 horsepower car.
[01:40:56.668 --> 01:41:02.070]  I thought it was normal that I didn't like the cops dealing drugs in my neighborhood and then running checkpoints looking for drugs.
[01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:05.571]  And I'd get in their face and they'd flip out and take me to jail and threaten to kill me.
[01:41:05.571 --> 01:41:08.652]  I thought it was normal to want to support the Second Amendment.
[01:41:08.652 --> 01:41:10.593]  When I learned they were coming after the Second Amendment when I was 18,
[01:41:12.014 --> 01:41:16.038]  I said, you know, I'm going to stop drinking and stop fighting and get my life straight and start exercising.
[01:41:16.038 --> 01:41:17.320]  Got in incredible shape.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.143]  Got my life together for about five years.
[01:41:20.143 --> 01:41:23.266]  Kind of went back to being bad a little bit, drinking and smoking after that.
[01:41:23.266 --> 01:41:24.588]  Got depressed about the New World Order.
[01:41:24.588 --> 01:41:26.750]  Turned into Jabba the Hutt.
[01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:28.111]  Now I've reversed about 60-70% of that.
[01:41:29.775 --> 01:41:31.316]  Horrible transformation.
[01:41:31.316 --> 01:41:36.918]  But the point is, is that the public are so childlike and so naive, and that's why they don't want you playing competitive sports.
[01:41:36.918 --> 01:41:42.880]  That's why they don't want you playing dodgeball, or jogging, or wrestling, or shaking hands, or anything.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:48.403]  Because in the nanny state, they want you cowardly and not developed.
[01:41:48.403 --> 01:41:53.985]  And you've got men and women who are in arrested development, especially men, where they freeze men at the age of children.
[01:41:54.833 --> 01:42:07.142]  I mean, everywhere I go, I hear men talking about football and basketball and what happened with Duke and Wisconsin, and they'll say to me, even listeners, hey Alex, what do you think about that basketball game?
[01:42:07.142 --> 01:42:11.745]  And I'll go, you know, I used to like that, but those are kind of the things of a child.
[01:42:11.745 --> 01:42:16.228]  You know they designed that because your mind's meant for warfare and business.
[01:42:16.228 --> 01:42:21.372]  And to war game things, you're supposed to be really aggressive and dominant as a male, and building a better world.
[01:42:22.662 --> 01:42:26.924]  And standing up against the other aggressive males that are weaker, but they'll use cheating to get ahead.
[01:42:26.924 --> 01:42:29.865]  We're supposed to defeat them and stand up for our women and children.
[01:42:29.865 --> 01:42:30.865]  And they'll go, whoa, whoa, dude.
[01:42:30.865 --> 01:42:32.466]  And I go, wait, you know who I am?
[01:42:32.466 --> 01:42:34.607]  You just said, hey, Alex, what'd you think of the game?
[01:42:34.607 --> 01:42:35.768]  I don't know you.
[01:42:35.768 --> 01:42:38.709]  And you just stopped me on the street asking me about a game.
[01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:39.929]  Is that, this happened yesterday.
[01:42:39.929 --> 01:42:41.350]  I go, is that some kind of joke?
[01:42:43.134 --> 01:42:46.175]  Because, buddy, I'm dealing with Fukushima.
[01:42:46.175 --> 01:42:48.635]  I'm dealing with cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[01:42:48.635 --> 01:42:51.236]  I'm dealing with chemical weapon attacks on the public.
[01:42:51.236 --> 01:42:52.816]  And it's not because I'm some hero.
[01:42:52.816 --> 01:42:54.396]  This is a normal response.
[01:42:54.396 --> 01:43:04.378]  In fact, my forebears would have already organized at the legislative level, and they would already have a physical war going on right now, okay?
[01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:08.679]  That was because they were businessmen, merchants, but also been in the average male by the age of 35.
[01:43:10.464 --> 01:43:14.828]  in 1776 had been in three guerrilla wars.
[01:43:14.828 --> 01:43:17.430]  That's another reason the British were in big trouble.
[01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:20.732]  Oh, they thought some of their soldiers had maybe been in one war?
[01:43:20.732 --> 01:43:22.013]  Had such a high turnover rate?
[01:43:22.013 --> 01:43:24.996]  We're about to find out they've been in three wars?
[01:43:24.996 --> 01:43:27.277]  In the space of 15 years?
[01:43:27.277 --> 01:43:29.099]  So, I mean, I'm nobody.
[01:43:29.099 --> 01:43:33.883]  I mean, our forebears would be running around killing people right now, okay?
[01:43:35.029 --> 01:43:41.595]  They wouldn't be usurped, they wouldn't be enslaved, they wouldn't be run over by a bunch of slick-talking Underwoods.
[01:43:41.595 --> 01:43:43.797]  They'd strangle them!
[01:43:43.797 --> 01:43:52.965]  And not because they weren't as manipulative as Underwood, but because they were honorable and they were men who could do things out in the open!
[01:43:52.965 --> 01:43:57.369]  And who had people follow them because they were strong and virtuous!
[01:43:57.369 --> 01:44:00.872]  Not piles of manipulative, lying crap!
[01:44:05.776 --> 01:44:07.538]  Excuse me.
[01:44:07.538 --> 01:44:11.541]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:16.846]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:44:16.846 --> 01:44:17.146]  800-259-9231.
[01:44:17.146 --> 01:44:27.395]  I just, all I hear, men in grocery stores, in restaurants, at swimming pools, at the gym, at church, everywhere.
[01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:31.719]  They just want to talk to me about stuff on record with the Olympic Committee, 1914,
[01:44:33.942 --> 01:44:40.091]  And this French prince that developed it with the Germans to manipulate the public into not being involved in real issues.
[01:44:40.091 --> 01:44:43.496]  I mean, I know, I've read the books written by Edward Bernays.
[01:44:43.496 --> 01:44:47.602]  I've read the papers written by the founder of the Olympic Committee.
[01:44:47.602 --> 01:44:50.045]  I have read the statements by Hitler on sports.
[01:44:50.646 --> 01:44:55.489]  I know it's to manipulate men, where men sit around in fantasy football.
[01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:57.751]  I mean, you might as well game the stock market.
[01:44:57.751 --> 01:44:59.152]  You might as well have fun.
[01:44:59.152 --> 01:45:02.774]  But it's just these aren't men.
[01:45:02.774 --> 01:45:05.236]  These aren't men.
[01:45:05.236 --> 01:45:14.722]  These are the type of men who will go work their arms out all day, so they think they're big, who will just do the symbol of being manly and will say something smart to you or try to intimidate you.
[01:45:14.722 --> 01:45:19.446]  And the minute you turn to them and go, let's go right now, just just touch me and I'm going to break your neck.
[01:45:20.236 --> 01:45:23.818]  They go, whoa dude, wait a minute, I thought you wanted to act tough, man!
[01:45:23.818 --> 01:45:25.919]  I thought you wanted to kill me!
[01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:27.139]  I thought you were strong!
[01:45:27.139 --> 01:45:29.901]  No, you're not a man!
[01:45:29.901 --> 01:45:31.762]  You're the fake image of one!
[01:45:31.762 --> 01:45:33.543]  You don't build anything!
[01:45:33.543 --> 01:45:34.983]  You're not even alive!
[01:45:34.983 --> 01:45:37.685]  Your women and children don't belong to you!
[01:45:37.685 --> 01:45:40.206]  They belong to the globalists who conquered you!
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.541]  I don't want to be conquered.
[01:45:43.541 --> 01:45:45.363]  I don't want to have my destiny controlled.
[01:45:45.363 --> 01:45:47.365]  I don't want my children brainwashed.
[01:45:47.365 --> 01:45:52.009]  I don't want to be a slave and that humanity's done and we're being phased out.
[01:45:52.009 --> 01:45:55.612]  No!
[01:45:55.612 --> 01:46:00.856]  So do not ask me about football or baseball.
[01:46:00.856 --> 01:46:04.359]  I was... I hadn't seen Charlie Sheen in about a year.
[01:46:04.359 --> 01:46:05.260]  I wanted to go check in on him.
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:06.641]  He's doing pretty good.
[01:46:06.641 --> 01:46:08.343]  Trying to do yoga and exercise and stuff.
[01:46:09.724 --> 01:46:13.167]  I knew Charlie back when he was straight and not partying at all 12 years ago.
[01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:15.209]  He's a great guy overall.
[01:46:15.209 --> 01:46:16.150]  At least he's a real person.
[01:46:16.150 --> 01:46:22.475]  And here he had Babe Ruth's World Series ring, Babe Ruth's Yankee contract, all this incredible stuff.
[01:46:22.475 --> 01:46:26.579]  And it was really neat and interesting.
[01:46:26.579 --> 01:46:31.303]  But I thought it was more interesting, even though he has a lot of problems, that he had the courage to come out for 9-11 Truth.
[01:46:31.303 --> 01:46:32.845]  That's a lot more exciting to me.
[01:46:35.208 --> 01:46:44.091]  Than the fact that he has a room full of Babe Ruth's memorabilia that you won't see at the World Baseball Hall of Fame.
[01:46:44.091 --> 01:46:45.031]  Let's talk about that.
[01:46:45.031 --> 01:46:46.232]  He didn't tell me not to.
[01:46:46.232 --> 01:46:50.093]  The point is, is that I don't care.
[01:46:50.093 --> 01:46:52.073]  Even though Babe Ruth was a really cool guy.
[01:46:52.073 --> 01:46:54.694]  A man's man.
[01:46:54.694 --> 01:46:58.015]  Compared to these men nowadays, you could admire Babe Ruth because he was real.
[01:46:58.015 --> 01:47:02.577]  He wasn't a fake.
[01:47:02.577 --> 01:47:03.557]  But that's because he grew up
[01:47:06.877 --> 01:47:11.038]  In a rough saloon with a brothel on top of it.
[01:47:11.038 --> 01:47:16.440]  And even though you can point your finger and say, Babe Ruth was an immoral guy, he liked women and liked to fight, well give me a break!
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:22.901]  That's a lot better than selling out to this system and selling out to this fake culture and just being total jellyfish!
[01:47:22.901 --> 01:47:27.963]  I'll take somebody real any day of the week over one of these fakes.
[01:47:27.963 --> 01:47:28.623]  And I'm ranting.
[01:47:28.623 --> 01:47:31.724]  I want to go to Francis and Steve and Charlie when we come back from break.
[01:47:31.724 --> 01:47:34.785]  We got a big Fukushima update coming, but that's only 30 minutes long.
[01:47:34.785 --> 01:47:36.085]  Then we'll continue with phone calls.
[01:47:37.861 --> 01:47:39.482]  I didn't mean to get mad.
[01:47:39.482 --> 01:47:41.925]  I apologize for that.
[01:47:41.925 --> 01:47:45.408]  Coming up after that, NASA will fight alien life in 10 to 20 years.
[01:47:45.408 --> 01:47:47.910]  I think we've already found the globalists, a bunch of psychopaths.
[01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:49.311]  They're not human in my view.
[01:47:49.311 --> 01:47:51.153]  LA Times.
[01:47:51.153 --> 01:47:54.556]  Got a bunch of other news on InfoWars.com that I haven't gotten to.
[01:47:54.556 --> 01:47:58.159]  We're going to cover it all.
[01:47:58.159 --> 01:47:59.200]  Just briefly here.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:07.404]  I wanted to just remind folks that I put out a mistake yesterday, and I want to correct it.
[01:48:07.404 --> 01:48:19.315]  I said that you could get free shipping on Super Female Vitality, because we had free shipping on everything, but now it's just on the Alex Challenge Pack.
[01:48:19.315 --> 01:48:27.502]  That's the Super Male, the Survival Shield X2, Niacin Iodine, Deep Earth Source that nobody else has got, and the Oxy Powder that flushes out your upper and lower intestine.
[01:48:28.592 --> 01:48:33.754]  That's why over the last 45 days, same amount of exercise, probably less, lost another six pounds, increased muscle mass.
[01:48:33.754 --> 01:48:37.235]  It's just amazing what it does.
[01:48:37.235 --> 01:48:43.457]  Now, we're sold out of the female for probably another two, three weeks.
[01:48:43.457 --> 01:48:45.257]  So I just forgotten that was sold out.
[01:48:45.257 --> 01:48:48.538]  So we can't offer the super female because we don't have it.
[01:48:48.538 --> 01:48:53.800]  So the Alex Pack Challenge is
[01:48:55.563 --> 01:48:58.445]  Just the male, but it works just as good for females.
[01:48:58.445 --> 01:49:03.508]  The female just has a little bit more of two ingredients that, quite frankly, deal with libido.
[01:49:03.508 --> 01:49:05.088]  And that's just how Group designed it.
[01:49:05.088 --> 01:49:11.572]  But if you want the physical attributes, libido, stamina, aggression, the whole nine yards, it really works.
[01:49:11.572 --> 01:49:13.553]  I am taking a full dose now, probably more than a full dose.
[01:49:13.553 --> 01:49:15.975]  At first, I only take about half a dose the first year I was on it.
[01:49:15.975 --> 01:49:19.757]  I've increased it and I feel like I'm 20 years old again.
[01:49:20.831 --> 01:49:22.231]  And it really works.
[01:49:22.231 --> 01:49:27.492]  And it's just natural, concentrated herbs and other extracts that turbocharge you.
[01:49:27.492 --> 01:49:29.073]  And it's thick oil, folks.
[01:49:29.073 --> 01:49:30.693]  It isn't this watery crud.
[01:49:30.693 --> 01:49:31.913]  Like the Lung Cleanse, all of it.
[01:49:31.913 --> 01:49:33.574]  This is real stuff.
[01:49:33.574 --> 01:49:38.335]  You can get all three of those with free shipping and they're discounted.
[01:49:38.335 --> 01:49:42.036]  Infowarslife.com, the Alex Challenge Pack.
[01:49:42.036 --> 01:49:47.097]  That's not the Alex Pack at Infowarshealth.com on three of the best products from Yongevity.
[01:49:47.097 --> 01:49:47.877]  That's a good deal as well.
[01:49:49.352 --> 01:49:56.657]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:49:56.657 --> 01:49:59.198]  Free shipping, which is more than a $10 value.
[01:49:59.198 --> 01:50:00.199]  It's substantive.
[01:50:00.199 --> 01:50:01.600]  But just stop procrastinating.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.940]  It supports the broadcast.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.141]  You're going to take the Oxy-Powder.
[01:50:04.141 --> 01:50:04.902]  You've heard the reviews.
[01:50:04.902 --> 01:50:07.603]  You're going to take the Survival Shield, Super Metal Vitality.
[01:50:07.603 --> 01:50:10.225]  I mean, no one I know except one caller.
[01:50:10.225 --> 01:50:14.668]  We've had one caller, not one email, nothing out of hundreds and hundreds saying that it doesn't work.
[01:50:15.478 --> 01:50:16.479]  Believe me, it works.
[01:50:16.479 --> 01:50:19.423]  In fact, look when I was 22 and quit working out.
[01:50:19.423 --> 01:50:22.347]  That shot, if you're looking on TV, that's when I was 22 years old.
[01:50:22.347 --> 01:50:25.852]  Let's just say there was no problem with the ladies, obviously.
[01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:28.615]  And then I just quit working out.
[01:50:28.615 --> 01:50:29.356]  Just stopped.
[01:50:30.259 --> 01:50:31.639]  And I gained almost 100 pounds.
[01:50:31.639 --> 01:50:33.960]  Well, I've almost lost like 70% of that.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:34.860]  I don't know.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.081]  Do the math.
[01:50:36.081 --> 01:50:38.021]  Another 20 pounds to lose.
[01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:38.642]  And you know what?
[01:50:38.642 --> 01:50:42.123]  When I lose 20 pounds, if I do, I'm going to look, just with less error, like I looked right there.
[01:50:42.123 --> 01:50:43.503]  I cannot wait.
[01:50:43.503 --> 01:50:48.345]  Not even because I'm an egomaniac, but because it'll make all my enemies angry, and I'll live long.
[01:50:48.345 --> 01:50:52.786]  So, and I owe it to the exercise, better eating, but I've already been doing that.
[01:50:52.786 --> 01:50:58.028]  It's taking all these supplements together that's done at Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:58.028 --> 01:50:58.388]  Try it out.
[01:50:59.178 --> 01:51:03.281]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:06.463]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.463 --> 01:51:07.884]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:07.884 --> 01:51:11.446]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:11.446 --> 01:51:12.947]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:51:12.947 --> 01:51:14.068]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:14.889 --> 01:51:17.071]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:29.605 --> 01:51:33.426]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[01:51:33.426 --> 01:51:37.927]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[01:51:37.927 --> 01:51:44.369]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.
[01:51:44.369 --> 01:51:51.351]  Founded by patriots who believe in liberty, Numana Food Storage is GMO-free, great tasting, and easy to prepare.
[01:51:51.351 --> 01:51:52.511]  Food is freedom!

[01:51:59.193 --> 01:52:08.684]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:52:08.684 --> 01:52:13.390]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:17.775]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:52:18.155 --> 01:52:21.199]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:52:21.199 --> 01:52:23.623]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:52:23.623 --> 01:52:27.188]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:52:27.188 --> 01:52:31.073]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:52:31.073 --> 01:52:34.598]  The research and development took over two years, but the result is
[01:52:34.718 --> 01:52:36.219]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:52:36.219 --> 01:52:37.040]  Why travel with this?
[01:53:04.818 --> 01:53:06.660]  When you can use this.
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:12.645]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:53:12.645 --> 01:53:19.872]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:53:19.872 --> 01:53:25.818]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:53:25.818 --> 01:53:29.041]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:53:29.521 --> 01:53:34.203]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:53:34.203 --> 01:53:44.748]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions have all shown Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:53:44.748 --> 01:53:47.950]  Supernatural Silver is a must-have for your arsenal.
[01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:54.173]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and use the promo code SILVER2015 for 30% off.
[01:53:54.173 --> 01:53:58.375]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[01:54:04.003 --> 01:54:06.846]  Alright, I've thrown out a lot of subjects.
[01:54:06.846 --> 01:54:10.388]  We're opening the phones up.
[01:54:10.388 --> 01:54:13.291]  800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[01:54:13.291 --> 01:54:16.854]  800-259-9231 on this live Wednesday edition.
[01:54:16.854 --> 01:54:19.556]  New defense rules would give Japan new powers to aid U.S.
[01:54:19.556 --> 01:54:20.877]  military.
[01:54:20.877 --> 01:54:21.157]  U.S.
[01:54:21.157 --> 01:54:27.763]  Aerospace Command moving their command centers into underground bunkers that they haven't used since the Cold War.
[01:54:27.763 --> 01:54:28.023]  U.S.
[01:54:28.023 --> 01:54:30.465]  to speed up delivery of weapons to Saudi-led forces in Yemen.
[01:54:32.122 --> 01:54:34.343]  Iran deploys warships off the Yemen coast.
[01:54:34.343 --> 01:54:41.588]  I mean, this is the type of craziness that is going on right now as the world spirals out of control.
[01:54:41.588 --> 01:54:46.090]  As Boehner, who rarely tells the truth, did last week in Israel, saying the world is, quote, on fire.
[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:57.537]  But the really important news is Dukes of Hazzard star James Best, who played bumbling sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane on the hit 80s TV show, died at the age of 88.
[01:54:57.537 --> 01:54:59.979]  The lovable criminal cop.
[01:55:02.332 --> 01:55:04.595]  Working for Boss Hogg.
[01:55:04.595 --> 01:55:06.477]  Yeah, Boss Hogg.
[01:55:06.477 --> 01:55:10.221]  Would Boss Hogg fluoridate the town to actually give kids cancer?
[01:55:10.221 --> 01:55:11.162]  I don't think so.
[01:55:11.162 --> 01:55:17.270]  So as bad as Boss Hogg was, a fictional character, he doesn't hold a candle to the real deal, does he?
[01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:22.356]  You know the best part of the Dukes of Hazzard, which I was not really a fan of, so stupid, but I was a little kid when that was on?
[01:55:23.697 --> 01:55:27.920]  When it first aired is the intro song by Waylon Jennings.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:30.782]  Just some good old boys, never meanin' no harm.
[01:55:30.782 --> 01:55:33.643]  Been in trouble with the law since the day they were born.
[01:55:33.643 --> 01:55:38.006]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Tennessee on House of Cards.
[01:55:38.006 --> 01:55:40.628]  We'll talk to Francis, Charlie, Billy Bob and others.
[01:55:40.628 --> 01:55:41.989]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Steven.
[01:55:41.989 --> 01:55:45.551]  Hello.
[01:55:45.551 --> 01:55:46.232]  Hey brother, go ahead.
[01:55:46.232 --> 01:55:48.513]  I'm calling in about House of Cards.
[01:55:48.513 --> 01:55:49.814]  I heard you talking about it earlier.
[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:56.484]  It sounded like from what you were saying that you were watching Season 1.
[01:55:56.484 --> 01:56:06.051]  Yes, I haven't watched Season 2 or 3 yet, but it's all programming for economic takeover, kicking old people off Social Security, euthanizing folks.
[01:56:06.051 --> 01:56:07.932]  It's all globalist propaganda from what I've seen.
[01:56:07.932 --> 01:56:09.934]  I've only seen 7 episodes.
[01:56:09.934 --> 01:56:13.256]  Does it change as it progresses?
[01:56:13.256 --> 01:56:16.639]  Well, I agree with you that it's very intriguing to watch.
[01:56:16.639 --> 01:56:18.921]  They do a very good job of presenting all that.
[01:56:19.951 --> 01:56:21.933]  Yeah, I wanted to bring up in Season 3.
[01:56:21.933 --> 01:56:24.335]  It just came out this year and I was watching it.
[01:56:24.335 --> 01:56:25.496]  I finished it already.
[01:56:25.496 --> 01:56:40.068]  There's this crazy scene where Francis goes into a church with his bodyguards and he literally walks up to a statue of Christ and he spits in the face of Christ and a moment later the statue falls to the ground and shatters into a million pieces.
[01:56:40.068 --> 01:56:42.790]  It's really a shocking scene.
[01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:47.514]  So they're basically saying he is the Antichrist and it's pretty sick.
[01:56:47.514 --> 01:56:48.375]  What episode is that?
[01:56:50.497 --> 01:56:52.179]  I'm somewhere in the middle of season three.
[01:56:52.179 --> 01:56:54.863]  I can't recall exactly which one it is right now.
[01:56:54.863 --> 01:56:59.588]  Well, they're selling being evil as cool and then in the end it's for the greater good.
[01:56:59.588 --> 01:57:02.011]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:02.011 --> 01:57:04.153]  Let's talk to Charlie in California.
[01:57:04.153 --> 01:57:04.794]  You're on the air.
[01:57:04.794 --> 01:57:05.135]  Go ahead.
[01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:17.159]  Sir, I just want to say, uh, I was raised in the Baptist Church, and we used to sing the old hymn, and when the saints go marching... John, are you hearing that?
[01:57:17.159 --> 01:57:17.540]  No, it's not you.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:18.820]  You're the last caller to the tube.
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:20.241]  I'm just having the audio engineer here.
[01:57:20.241 --> 01:57:20.621]  Go ahead.
[01:57:43.916 --> 01:57:47.318]  Go ahead, Charlie, try to get your point out and I'll shut up.
[01:57:47.318 --> 01:57:57.564]  I just wanted to say, man, we used to sing a song in the church about when the saints go marching in, man, and I just want, I feel like we're living that time now with the old biblical teachings in.
[01:57:58.516 --> 01:58:01.918]  You know, it's just great to be part of resistance, man.
[01:58:01.918 --> 01:58:06.281]  And these globalists are trying every day to divide and conquer, and you bring all that out.
[01:58:06.281 --> 01:58:11.965]  And we out here, we think, well, this is the only portal, man, that's talking about what's really going on.
[01:58:11.965 --> 01:58:14.667]  And I just want to speak out on a point you made earlier.
[01:58:14.727 --> 01:58:15.087]  Well, good.
[01:58:15.087 --> 01:58:15.708]  Don't hang up.
[01:58:15.708 --> 01:58:17.089]  I'm gonna come back to you, Charlie.
[01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:18.950]  We're gonna try to fix our phone system here.
[01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:20.151]  Then we'll go to Francis and others.
[01:58:20.151 --> 01:58:22.052]  The other phone lines are down.
[01:58:22.052 --> 01:58:25.375]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:58:25.375 --> 01:58:27.076]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:27.076 --> 01:58:27.777]  Don't hang up, Charlie.
[01:58:27.777 --> 01:58:28.717]  70 seconds.
[01:58:28.717 --> 01:58:30.078]  We'll be right back with you.
[01:58:30.078 --> 01:58:32.140]  Third hour, Fukushima update.
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:33.541]  It's all coming up.
[01:58:33.541 --> 01:58:34.342]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:58:34.882 --> 01:58:38.825]  We need to break our conditioning, find our spirit again, and wake up and resist.
[01:58:38.825 --> 01:58:40.246]  But you gotta wake up first.

[02:00:04.798 --> 02:00:06.099]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.099 --> 02:00:07.880]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.641]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.641 --> 02:00:11.202]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.202 --> 02:00:12.762]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.762 --> 02:00:16.945]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.945 --> 02:00:27.311]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.311 --> 02:00:29.412]  We are now into hour number three.
[02:00:31.172 --> 02:00:33.454]  And no fault network or macros.
[02:00:33.454 --> 02:00:42.040]  Every once in a while, computerized phone systems have hiccups, so the phone system's down, except for Charlie, Jay, and Francis that got through, and there's some audio issues there, but we'll go to folks regardless.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:47.164]  I think we're gonna turn the system off at the break and reboot it, so we can take calls at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:47.164 --> 02:00:49.946]  But Charlie in California, you were talking about...
[02:00:50.746 --> 02:00:53.349]  There's not a lot of news portals that really get it.
[02:00:53.349 --> 02:00:57.274]  And I think there's a lot of folks out there that are concerned and somewhat awake.
[02:00:57.274 --> 02:00:59.477]  They just don't get how bad it really is.
[02:00:59.477 --> 02:01:04.463]  Like, Germans didn't believe that Hitler was really killing all those people because it was hidden.
[02:01:04.463 --> 02:01:07.426]  And folks didn't believe that the Germans actually didn't know, but most of them didn't.
[02:01:08.434 --> 02:01:16.400]  And I think it's the same thing that we've seen throughout history, is that people are in denial because they can't imagine that things could really be that bad.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:23.605]  But we know, because of alternative media and even what's been admitted that this plan is happening, where do you see all this going?
[02:01:23.605 --> 02:01:26.767]  Because what you first said really lit a fire under me.
[02:01:26.767 --> 02:01:27.208]  You're right.
[02:01:28.303 --> 02:01:30.705]  It's epic to be able to fight this!
[02:01:30.705 --> 02:01:33.847]  It's an incredible time, it's so exciting!
[02:01:33.847 --> 02:01:43.213]  I mean, I'm not happy about it, but it's exciting when you really study all this, how epic it is, and how huge it is, and how important it is.
[02:01:43.213 --> 02:01:46.035]  Go ahead, Charlie, you've got the floor.
[02:01:46.035 --> 02:01:53.681]  Yes, you're absolutely right, Alex, and it's just so, what makes it more exciting is to be on God's team.
[02:01:53.681 --> 02:01:55.642]  You know, everything the globalists tell us
[02:01:56.132 --> 02:01:59.055]  It's okay to do God said don't do.
[02:01:59.055 --> 02:02:07.224]  And you know, how can the attorney come out when he did his part to help bring America down in that 9-11 fiasco?
[02:02:07.224 --> 02:02:10.508]  I mean, it is terrible how they play on us and tell us
[02:02:11.567 --> 02:02:15.228]  You know, they just want us to believe anything they come out and say.
[02:02:15.228 --> 02:02:20.910]  Obama is just another stage of what Bush and Cheney was doing, helping to bring our country down.
[02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:29.952]  It hurts me so much to see the little children out there who are hoping for a future, man, and they ain't gonna have no future if these globalists get their way.
[02:02:29.952 --> 02:02:35.774]  I just tell you, but I tell you this, Alex, man, it's a blessing, man, to be able to talk to you this morning.
[02:02:35.774 --> 02:02:39.555]  God is with the righteous, man, and doggone it, the globalists gonna lose.
[02:02:40.572 --> 02:02:47.377]  There's no way they can win, and I thank you, brother, for all you're doing, and it's just great to be part of it, man.
[02:02:47.742 --> 02:02:49.363]  Well, God bless you too, sir.
[02:02:49.363 --> 02:02:58.748]  We're all brothers and sisters together in spirit, and that's the great unity of loving liberty and freedom and God versus the devil and his systems.
[02:02:58.748 --> 02:03:03.151]  That's why they want to divide us, because our souls, our hearts, are just the same.
[02:03:03.151 --> 02:03:03.931]  We are together.
[02:03:03.931 --> 02:03:04.552]  We are brothers.
[02:03:04.552 --> 02:03:06.193]  God bless you, my brother.
[02:03:06.193 --> 02:03:06.693]  Absolutely.
[02:03:06.693 --> 02:03:11.696]  That's why the enemy wants to divide us, because they know in our heart is our conscience and what brings us together.
[02:03:12.415 --> 02:03:13.515]  We're all children of God.
[02:03:13.515 --> 02:03:18.896]  The only question is, you know, do we end up splitting off and making the devil our father?
[02:03:18.896 --> 02:03:21.997]  I see the atheists on the website going, quit talking about God!
[02:03:21.997 --> 02:03:36.380]  Even if you don't believe in God, the archetype of good versus evil, God versus the devil, creation versus destruction, life versus death, free market versus conquest, it's real.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:37.680]  We manifest it.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:38.660]  And it goes beyond that.
[02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:46.313]  Yeah, I mean, that's what frustrates me.
[02:03:46.313 --> 02:03:49.438]  Cheney tells the truth and says Obama's bringing America down.
[02:03:49.438 --> 02:03:54.627]  And as the caller just said, as Charles just said, it's just an extension of the same agenda.
[02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:56.269]  And that's how they make themselves look good.
[02:03:57.833 --> 02:04:02.076]  Is that they can criticize the globalist agenda when they're not in power and act like they're not part of it.
[02:04:02.076 --> 02:04:04.137]  So they get right back in power.
[02:04:04.137 --> 02:04:05.938]  The right foot takes a step.
[02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:07.600]  Then the left acts like they're against it.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.981]  They take a step.
[02:04:08.981 --> 02:04:10.241]  Let's quit looking at the legs.
[02:04:10.241 --> 02:04:14.564]  Let's look at the body and the head and the brain and the arms of the globalist operation.
[02:04:14.564 --> 02:04:16.285]  And that's the big central banks.
[02:04:16.285 --> 02:04:24.071]  That's a handful of families that have decided to screw humanity over so it gives them full control.
[02:04:24.071 --> 02:04:25.732]  To keep humanity dumbed down and divided.
[02:04:27.318 --> 02:04:28.640]  It's sick.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:37.330]  And then they know we thirst for unity, so then after they divide us, they come in with their unity, which is really unity under their tyranny.
[02:04:37.330 --> 02:04:45.800]  We're gonna come back with this little promo piece, only aired once last week, with Mayberry, Barney Fife, and Schoolhouse Rock.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:55.229]  How America's changed, how the messages, how the brainwashing has just become so over-the-top evil compared to what it was previously.
[02:04:55.229 --> 02:04:57.211]  And then we're gonna go to your calls and get a Fukushima update.
[02:04:58.752 --> 02:05:03.894]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:06:30.213 --> 02:06:38.080]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:48.968]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty
[02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:50.069]  It's pretty exciting and I love it.

[02:07:55.443 --> 02:07:57.084]  The British are coming!
[02:07:57.084 --> 02:08:04.268]  The British are coming!
[02:08:04.268 --> 02:08:10.011]  Now the ride of Paul Revere set the nation on its ear.
[02:08:10.011 --> 02:08:12.653]  And the shock at Lexington heard round the world.
[02:08:14.895 --> 02:08:15.576]  I think?
[02:08:23.826 --> 02:08:49.225]  And on to Concord, marched the foe To seize the arsenal, there you know Waiting folks, searching all around Till our militia stopped them in their tracks At the old North Bridge, we turned them back And chased those Redcoats back to Boston Town And the shout around the world Was the start of a revolution The men and men were ready on the move
[02:08:54.676 --> 02:09:07.350]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they'd put a light up in this high church steeple.
[02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:09.453]  And Paul went down there to look.
[02:09:09.453 --> 02:09:13.097]  And sure enough, there was the light, burning Briar Day.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:17.421]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out.
[02:09:17.421 --> 02:09:20.682]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[02:09:20.682 --> 02:09:22.142]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[02:09:22.142 --> 02:09:30.864]  That old horse with his ears laid back and his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine, feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[02:09:30.864 --> 02:09:34.465]  Paul holding on for dear life and a hollering at the top of his lungs.
[02:09:34.465 --> 02:09:36.105]  He says, the British is coming!
[02:09:36.105 --> 02:09:37.385]  The British is coming!
[02:09:37.385 --> 02:09:39.846]  Get your gun, we gonna have us a revolution!
[02:09:40.692 --> 02:09:45.253]  And them farmers come a-piling out of the hay like bees out of a beehive.
[02:09:45.253 --> 02:09:46.653]  Minute men, they's called.
[02:09:46.653 --> 02:09:47.873]  What's minute men?
[02:09:47.873 --> 02:09:48.973]  Minute men?
[02:09:48.973 --> 02:09:51.414]  They's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[02:09:51.414 --> 02:09:59.815]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[02:09:59.815 --> 02:10:07.077]  And when the British come a-prancing along all dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it.
[02:10:07.077 --> 02:10:08.417]  It was a sight to see.
[02:10:10.032 --> 02:10:11.633]  And then it happened.
[02:10:11.633 --> 02:10:13.294]  They fired the gun!
[02:10:13.294 --> 02:10:15.296]  They fired the gun.
[02:10:15.296 --> 02:10:21.400]  And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:24.982]  Oh, get out!
[02:10:24.982 --> 02:10:31.227]  That's the way this country started.
[02:10:31.227 --> 02:10:32.868]  And our so-called government...
[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:43.928]  Says the number one threat's not Al Qaeda or ISIS that they openly fund to destabilize the globe and to take our liberties as a pretext of protecting us.
[02:10:43.928 --> 02:10:50.053]  No, they say veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, Christians are the enemy.
[02:10:51.448 --> 02:10:55.069]  Because this is an alien foreign occupational government we have.
[02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:57.690]  And that's even mainstream news now on CNBC.
[02:10:57.690 --> 02:10:59.611]  They say, we're run by foreign banks.
[02:10:59.611 --> 02:11:00.932]  We're conquered.
[02:11:00.932 --> 02:11:05.633]  And Goldman Sachs goes, we've installed three presidents and prime ministers in Europe last year.
[02:11:05.633 --> 02:11:10.896]  They don't even have elections in places like Italy.
[02:11:10.896 --> 02:11:14.757]  They just put them in!
[02:11:14.757 --> 02:11:16.958]  See, we've gone from warning you this was all coming,
[02:11:18.203 --> 02:11:20.844]  So now they've got the Asian Pacific Union.
[02:11:20.844 --> 02:11:22.845]  One piece of it leaked by WikiLeaks.
[02:11:22.845 --> 02:11:24.546]  Ends internet freedom as we know.
[02:11:24.546 --> 02:11:27.927]  Obama's lining that up with the FCC now.
[02:11:27.927 --> 02:11:29.688]  Globally.
[02:11:29.688 --> 02:11:35.830]  And the other 29 pieces... That's 33 pieces.
[02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:38.631]  So the other 32 pieces they're not releasing.
[02:11:38.631 --> 02:11:41.252]  And just saying, hey, you don't need to see it.
[02:11:41.252 --> 02:11:43.233]  Congress doesn't need to see it.
[02:11:43.233 --> 02:11:44.894]  This is over-the-top tyranny.
[02:11:47.356 --> 02:11:52.381]  And it's moving very, very quickly because the public is entertained to death.
[02:11:52.381 --> 02:11:56.384]  The public is in a mesmerized trance state, medically.
[02:11:56.384 --> 02:11:57.365]  Just look it up.
[02:11:57.365 --> 02:11:59.146]  TV lowers brainwaves.
[02:11:59.146 --> 02:12:01.388]  Television associated with Alzheimer's.
[02:12:01.388 --> 02:12:04.471]  Television associated with lower IQ.
[02:12:04.471 --> 02:12:10.857]  The public is in a spectator mode, thinking that they've gotten away with something, just being lazy.
[02:12:10.857 --> 02:12:13.019]  Not knowing the real universe is going on around them.
[02:12:14.249 --> 02:12:16.671]  Shuttered like a horse with blinders.
[02:12:16.671 --> 02:12:19.073]  Not seeing the 360 view around them.
[02:12:19.073 --> 02:12:23.837]  Just a narrow little globalist projected world.
[02:12:23.837 --> 02:12:28.522]  And our survival instinct is being destroyed.
[02:12:28.522 --> 02:12:34.387]  Learned helplessness and our normalcy bias is being expanded to where we'll put up with anything.
[02:12:36.397 --> 02:12:57.656]  And every historian, every PhD economist, or anthropologist, or sociologist, left, right, libertarian, says these are the global seeds of worldwide war, genocide, extermination, including here in America, with a hundred million people not in the workforce, and articles everywhere about driverless cars, driverless planes.
[02:12:57.656 --> 02:13:01.199]  Notice it's all rolling out, and I told you 20 years ago it was coming.
[02:13:03.266 --> 02:13:14.092]  And then meanwhile, we have 430-something reactors that are used for power worldwide, a bunch of other institutional research reactors and secret reactors.
[02:13:14.092 --> 02:13:20.476]  And 90-plus percent of them, even the UN and the federal government, the Atomic Energy Agency, all of them say 91, 92 percent are leaking.
[02:13:26.084 --> 02:13:27.445]  They don't even care now when they leak.
[02:13:27.445 --> 02:13:34.631]  In fact, a few years ago, San Diego and other areas had reactors nearby leaking, and the alarms would go off and scare people, so they just said, you know what?
[02:13:34.631 --> 02:13:42.158]  We're just gonna turn the alarm off now!
[02:13:42.158 --> 02:13:42.999]  And look at these headlines.
[02:13:42.999 --> 02:13:45.441]  Fukushima radiation has reached North American shores.
[02:13:45.441 --> 02:13:47.863]  We're gonna skip this network break coming up to give our guests more time.
[02:13:49.261 --> 02:13:52.143]  This is out of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
[02:13:52.143 --> 02:13:54.185]  It's in the Statesman Journal and others.
[02:13:54.185 --> 02:14:06.275]  Scientists at Woods Hole say that they're picking up cesium-134 and cesium-137 for the first time hitting the West Coast since the 2011 triple meltdown.
[02:14:06.275 --> 02:14:07.916]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:14:07.916 --> 02:14:09.337]  And they say nothing to worry about.
[02:14:09.337 --> 02:14:12.880]  And USA Today says that and others say that.
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:13.881]  Well, funny, I've got
[02:14:16.223 --> 02:14:22.105]  From 2011, Forbes, radiation detected in drinking water in 13 more U.S.
[02:14:22.105 --> 02:14:27.246]  cities, cesium-137 in the Vermont milk, so they just raised the level of what they said was safe.
[02:14:27.246 --> 02:14:33.408]  Here's another one, RT, radiation level in tuna off Oregon Coast tripled after Fukushima disaster.
[02:14:33.408 --> 02:14:33.848]  That's from 2014.
[02:14:33.848 --> 02:14:41.591]  Here's San Francisco, Gates, saying the same thing, Japan's radiation found in California, Bluefin Tuna.
[02:14:41.591 --> 02:14:42.251]  Bioaccumulate.
[02:14:43.484 --> 02:14:46.406]  I mean, I'm not going to go through the hundreds of other reports.
[02:14:46.406 --> 02:14:48.226]  I'm just going to hit a few of those.
[02:14:48.226 --> 02:14:51.928]  So even when they have to admit this, I mean, we sent Jakari Jackson and others out there last year.
[02:14:51.928 --> 02:14:56.191]  We should send them again to cover the water shortage and the radiation.
[02:14:56.191 --> 02:15:02.254]  And we would go up to the water and it'd be 120 times what they say safe here and 50 times here and 30 times there.
[02:15:02.254 --> 02:15:05.435]  And then they sent government crews out.
[02:15:05.435 --> 02:15:10.278]  And we were in the San Francisco Chronicle Unanimous a week later going, well, these conspiracy theorists said there was higher radiation.
[02:15:10.278 --> 02:15:12.259]  And they're right, but it's not a problem, kooks.
[02:15:14.858 --> 02:15:15.559]  Not a problem!
[02:15:15.559 --> 02:15:18.000]  Just 120 times, you know, the safe level.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:18.180]  What?
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:21.363]  And they go, you don't know how to run those field meters.
[02:15:21.363 --> 02:15:22.644]  Those aren't Geiger counters.
[02:15:22.644 --> 02:15:24.005]  Same difference.
[02:15:24.005 --> 02:15:24.685]  Didn't matter.
[02:15:24.685 --> 02:15:26.807]  The point was it was massively increased.
[02:15:26.807 --> 02:15:28.368]  But you're not an expert.
[02:15:28.368 --> 02:15:31.670]  We can go buy a calibrated machine, three of them, different brands.
[02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:32.771]  They showed the same thing!
[02:15:32.771 --> 02:15:42.398]  A lady catches a fish, it's just off the chart, you know, 200 times or something.
[02:15:43.889 --> 02:15:46.692]  Let's go to our guest, Jerry Peterman.
[02:15:46.692 --> 02:15:51.538]  I've had medical doctors, radiologists on so many, but he's the expert because he talks to all of them.
[02:15:51.538 --> 02:15:56.104]  FukushimaUpdateReport.com is probably the leading site, clearinghouse of real information.
[02:15:56.104 --> 02:16:03.252]  To break this down, he's an engineer in TV and radio and he also has the first
[02:16:04.801 --> 02:16:07.985]  Microcomputer-powered micro... He's a very interesting engineer.
[02:16:07.985 --> 02:16:09.548]  I'm not going to get into all of it.
[02:16:09.548 --> 02:16:19.701]  And he works with production, scientific advances, and such other varied disciplines as communication, transportation, alternative fuels, environmental waste disposal, satellite-delivered electronics, store-shelf advertising.
[02:16:20.302 --> 02:16:20.742]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:47.924 --> 02:16:59.237]  I think the thing that's most obvious is this is very similar to Brave New World where someone, something goes in and rewrites the news.
[02:17:00.506 --> 02:17:04.189]  That's what they're doing is just, oh, that's not what we said.
[02:17:04.189 --> 02:17:06.111]  We're rewriting it.
[02:17:06.111 --> 02:17:18.302]  We're looking at off the coast of California and the rate of seven becquerels of radiation per cubic meter of seawater, and that's quite a bit.
[02:17:18.302 --> 02:17:27.089]  It's not going to probably give you cancer immediately, but over a long period of time, you don't want to be eating fish in that condition.
[02:17:27.912 --> 02:17:28.672]  You just don't.
[02:17:28.672 --> 02:17:31.233]  I mean, it doesn't surprise me.
[02:17:31.233 --> 02:17:45.016]  When they first started detecting it in the air in April or May of 2011, they began to increase the amount that was acceptable.
[02:17:45.016 --> 02:17:46.816]  The U.S.
[02:17:46.816 --> 02:17:49.917]  Nuclear Agency began to increase that.
[02:17:49.917 --> 02:17:56.079]  So it doesn't surprise me at all.
[02:17:56.079 --> 02:17:56.839]  Breakdown!
[02:17:58.041 --> 02:18:00.843]  Your research because it's so wide and so huge.
[02:18:00.843 --> 02:18:02.104]  What are the real experts saying?
[02:18:02.104 --> 02:18:06.989]  Real experts saying we're in a world of hurt.
[02:18:06.989 --> 02:18:13.974]  We have something that is going to be around for the next several hundred generations.
[02:18:14.932 --> 02:18:22.174]  We're dealing with a runaway situation that no one knows how to deal with.
[02:18:22.174 --> 02:18:26.916]  I've written up something called Insane Things About Fukushima.
[02:18:26.916 --> 02:18:32.918]  And initially, everybody thought, oh, well, we'll have this contained in a year or two.
[02:18:32.918 --> 02:18:36.559]  We'll go in and contain the material and all this.
[02:18:37.319 --> 02:18:41.642]  Oh yeah, it's probably still in the containment vessel.
[02:18:41.642 --> 02:18:45.284]  All this different core material they call corium.
[02:18:45.284 --> 02:18:51.307]  It's a mixture of all the radionuclides in the plant.
[02:18:51.307 --> 02:18:56.410]  And truth of the matter is nobody ever went into this thing and took a look at it.
[02:18:56.410 --> 02:19:02.194]  And now it's been four years since this quote accident.
[02:19:02.194 --> 02:19:03.494]  And now what?
[02:19:03.494 --> 02:19:05.836]  We have a situation where TEPCO's
[02:19:06.556 --> 02:19:18.473]  Plant Chief just in March made the statement that it's going to be a 200-year wait before we have technology that even begins to know what to do with this thing.
[02:19:18.473 --> 02:19:21.057]  We have no viable method to deal with it.
[02:19:21.958 --> 02:19:23.919]  And there's so many uncertainties.
[02:19:23.919 --> 02:19:28.761]  We just really consider the problems insurmountable.
[02:19:28.761 --> 02:19:32.903]  And this could be possibly the worst possible result.
[02:19:32.903 --> 02:19:41.888]  Centuries could pass when another plant executive said centuries might pass before humans find a way to deal
[02:19:42.748 --> 02:19:47.051]  With these molten cores, we have no idea what to do.
[02:19:47.051 --> 02:19:55.016]  You see, the problem they're admitting now, after four years, the technology doesn't exist to deal with this.
[02:19:55.016 --> 02:19:57.277]  And so I was always
[02:19:59.458 --> 02:20:03.680]  A little bit in the dark as to what are we dealing with?
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:07.681]  How much material are we dealing with and what is it?
[02:20:07.681 --> 02:20:16.784]  And we found that the reports now indicate that at least 5% of this is plutonium activated as MOX fuel.
[02:20:18.141 --> 02:20:24.103]  And MOX fuel was, some people say, illegally being used in there.
[02:20:24.103 --> 02:20:27.665]  And that was the MOX 3 reactor that had the big mushroom cloud explosion.
[02:20:27.665 --> 02:20:34.287]  I was no engineer, but I looked at the online release designs and clearly said those are the rods being shot up through the air.
[02:20:34.287 --> 02:20:41.070]  And a year later they admitted that they shot up to two miles away, but the government here and there covered it up.
[02:20:41.610 --> 02:20:53.860]  And so that's my big question before we walk through all this with the head of one of the leading organizations that's engaged in massive research, FukushimaUpdateReport.com, Jerry Peterman.
[02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:57.403]  Why do the elites not seem to care?
[02:20:57.403 --> 02:20:59.224]  Why are they building more reactors?
[02:20:59.224 --> 02:21:03.968]  Why are they letting old ones rot and loading more fuel into them?
[02:21:03.968 --> 02:21:07.031]  I mean, it's almost like they want to kill everybody.
[02:21:07.031 --> 02:21:09.453]  I mean, what is wrong with the establishment?
[02:21:11.323 --> 02:21:16.607]  I think we've, by the way, take a look at that very carefully.
[02:21:16.607 --> 02:21:19.330]  What is the color of hydrogen when it burns?
[02:21:20.310 --> 02:21:21.711]  Hydrogen is clear.
[02:21:21.711 --> 02:21:24.814]  It does not produce a yellow flash.
[02:21:24.814 --> 02:21:33.161]  The only thing that does produce a yellow flash in that kind of environment is some kind of nuclear conflagration.
[02:21:33.161 --> 02:21:44.751]  And that's what Dr. Busby and other nuclear physicists have said here, and then, sure enough, universities outside of the government did the isotope test and said, yes, we show that fission occurred, correct?
[02:21:44.751 --> 02:21:45.472]  That's correct.
[02:21:46.494 --> 02:22:03.602]  And now we have people, after we've got the admission that there was fission, now they're beginning to look, well, if there was fission, I'll bet we had some neutron radiation released.
[02:22:03.602 --> 02:22:06.444]  Oh, but we couldn't have had that because there was no fission.
[02:22:06.444 --> 02:22:08.024]  Well, we had fission.
[02:22:08.024 --> 02:22:09.225]  Okay, well, let's look for it.
[02:22:10.336 --> 02:22:20.441]  Well, they're finding that their estimate was 13 billion times lower than was actually released.
[02:22:20.441 --> 02:22:26.124]  In other words, there is 13 billion times more neutron radiation that's been released.
[02:22:26.124 --> 02:22:33.488]  And a significant part of that is that every particle of the wastewater that's stored on site
[02:22:34.693 --> 02:22:39.297]  Has been subjected to neutron activation.
[02:22:39.297 --> 02:22:42.320]  And neutron activation is an interesting process.
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:45.483]  Radiation doesn't just go through the water.
[02:22:45.483 --> 02:22:57.473]  Every time a neutron hits a particle, let's say it's magnesium floating in the seawater, or iron, or copper, or whatever.
[02:22:57.473 --> 02:22:58.935]  It's creating radioactive water.
[02:23:00.004 --> 02:23:06.548]  Everything that it touches, a neutron touches, becomes radioactive.
[02:23:06.548 --> 02:23:20.157]  So you've got 144 million gallons of water stored on site where every particle inside those containment vessels are radioactive.
[02:23:20.157 --> 02:23:23.138]  And what is the half-life if this is plutonium radiation?
[02:23:23.138 --> 02:23:26.981]  I mean, we're not talking about cesium or something that breaks down in a few months, are we?
[02:23:27.972 --> 02:23:32.797]  No, that's the neat thing about nuclear power plants, they keep on giving.
[02:23:39.281 --> 02:23:51.069]  You can get the benefits of the pollution for a half-life of uranium is 4.2 billion years.
[02:23:51.069 --> 02:24:01.056]  So every time we create a nuclear power plant, we're creating a system that's going to produce waste that is going to last 4.2 billion years.
[02:24:01.056 --> 02:24:02.497]  Oh, that's the half-life.
[02:24:02.497 --> 02:24:06.781]  That means if it was a hundred then, just using a number,
[02:24:07.501 --> 02:24:11.350]  In 4.2 billion years, it's going to be 50.
[02:24:11.350 --> 02:24:16.141]  So it would take 8 billion plus years to become non-radioactive.
[02:24:17.423 --> 02:24:18.564]  Yeah, probably.
[02:24:18.564 --> 02:24:19.465]  Yeah.
[02:24:19.465 --> 02:24:21.526]  Yeah, it'd be beyond the end of the internet.
[02:24:21.526 --> 02:24:23.408]  So what is the nuclear industry thinking?
[02:24:23.408 --> 02:24:37.399]  Because when I was a kid and everything, I bought into the propaganda, hey, don't listen to the commies, nuclear power is great, but then Russia has them melting down, blowing up, Chernobyl, the cancers increase, all these leaking reactors.
[02:24:37.399 --> 02:24:39.720]  CBS News says 75% are leaking.
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:44.404]  We have news articles from the Atomic Energy Agency, as you know, saying 90 plus percent are leaking.
[02:24:44.404 --> 02:24:46.125]  It's like they had problems before,
[02:24:46.826 --> 02:24:50.329]  But suddenly, it seems like the establishment thinks it's good.
[02:24:50.329 --> 02:24:53.412]  I mean, are they space aliens that want to make the Earth radioactive?
[02:24:53.412 --> 02:24:55.995]  Because I'm trying to be logical here.
[02:24:55.995 --> 02:24:57.896]  You know, I don't think you're too far off.
[02:24:57.896 --> 02:25:02.381]  I'm not saying they're space aliens, but I will say something is not right.
[02:25:02.381 --> 02:25:05.384]  These people are certifiable.
[02:25:05.384 --> 02:25:11.649]  If you've got a car that's smoking going down the road, you'd think that probably at some point it's going to stop.
[02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:14.871]  Uh, and it throws out pollution all the time.
[02:25:14.871 --> 02:25:21.713]  You got these things leaking, uh, the common sense thing to do is fix them and keep going if you're going to be in that area.
[02:25:21.713 --> 02:25:22.353]  Exactly!
[02:25:22.353 --> 02:25:23.793]  And of course, I don't think it's aliens either.
[02:25:23.793 --> 02:25:32.056]  I'm just saying, they're so destructive that if they're not really aliens that want to live in a radioactive environment, this doesn't make sense.
[02:25:32.856 --> 02:25:35.118]  No, it doesn't make sense.
[02:25:35.118 --> 02:25:45.545]  You gotta consider the premise of producing waste that lasts four and a half billion years, or 4.2 billion years, just to create power for today.
[02:25:45.545 --> 02:25:50.788]  That really doesn't make sense either, but who's counting?
[02:25:50.788 --> 02:26:00.134]  Well, sure, but I mean, if they could contain it even somewhat safely, but they just... 91% of the plants are leaking, and it's getting worse, and the...
[02:26:01.627 --> 02:26:03.268]  These plants are supposed to stay open 30 years.
[02:26:03.268 --> 02:26:05.408]  A lot of them are now into their 40th plus year.
[02:26:05.408 --> 02:26:08.989]  And of course, for folks that don't know, the radiation just eats these plants.
[02:26:08.989 --> 02:26:10.290]  They're falling apart.
[02:26:10.290 --> 02:26:10.810]  Whistleblower.
[02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:15.851]  I mean, in the old days, they would poison plant workers if they warned the public about a small leak.
[02:26:15.851 --> 02:26:17.652]  Nowadays, they just go, hey, we don't care.
[02:26:18.524 --> 02:26:19.765]  We don't care.
[02:26:19.765 --> 02:26:22.047]  Now, I'll ask you a question.
[02:26:22.047 --> 02:26:24.529]  I'll bet you know this from your research.
[02:26:24.529 --> 02:26:33.317]  Where is the fuel stored, since we don't use Yucca flats, where is the fuel stored in the United States for reactors that spent fuel?
[02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:37.280]  They're generally stored, I think, what, about 85% of the time, last time I saw.
[02:26:38.583 --> 02:26:50.232]  Yes, and I can tell you for absolutely certain that most reactors have more fuel stored
[02:26:52.352 --> 02:26:57.675]  at their locations than Fukushima had stored in their situations.
[02:26:57.675 --> 02:27:14.925]  Now the chance of us having some kind of tsunami is probably not going to happen, but then again we have several reactors in the Ohio Basin and out on California fault lines that are sitting on top of earthquake fault zones, which
[02:27:15.385 --> 02:27:16.846]  That took a lot of common sense.
[02:27:16.846 --> 02:27:26.309]  I was going to ask you again, I've seen the global maps of where they store the stuff, whether it's the U.S., Japan, or even, well, they only seem to want to store them on earthquake lines.
[02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:28.690]  Is that a fun joke, or what's that?
[02:27:28.690 --> 02:27:32.051]  I have no idea, but you have to wonder where it's stored now.
[02:27:32.051 --> 02:27:37.233]  We've dumped 40,000 tons of nuclear material
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:41.422]  Depleted uranium, and that term is not accurate.
[02:27:41.422 --> 02:27:43.804]  It's still 30% radioactive.
[02:27:43.804 --> 02:27:47.846]  We dumped that on Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:27:47.846 --> 02:27:51.649]  And don't forget the Navy, under orders for 30 years, dumped it all off the U.S.
[02:27:51.649 --> 02:27:54.331]  coast, both east and west.
[02:27:54.331 --> 02:28:02.196]  Yeah, I don't think you have too much problem if you're down 10,000 or 15,000 feet in the ocean at the bottom.
[02:28:02.196 --> 02:28:04.497]  It's going to sit there for a while.
[02:28:04.497 --> 02:28:07.019]  But that really wasn't very bright either.
[02:28:08.888 --> 02:28:09.548]  I shouldn't laugh.
[02:28:09.548 --> 02:28:11.669]  This is just crazy.
[02:28:11.669 --> 02:28:15.191]  I mean, what can you do if you don't laugh in irony?
[02:28:15.191 --> 02:28:16.191]  What are you going to do?
[02:28:16.191 --> 02:28:17.412]  Cry about it?
[02:28:17.412 --> 02:28:24.915]  I mean, for God's sake, this is an end of the world scenario for this thing.
[02:28:24.915 --> 02:28:26.536]  Alex, I did not know.
[02:28:27.376 --> 02:28:32.438]  What amount of material we were dealing with in the molten cores.
[02:28:32.438 --> 02:28:37.821]  Let me tell you the size of a single molten core of the three.
[02:28:37.821 --> 02:28:47.265]  Those things are 30 to 47 feet across and two stories deep underneath each one of these.
[02:28:47.265 --> 02:28:50.206]  We're talking about something that is burning at 3,500 degrees
[02:28:53.462 --> 02:28:56.264]  And it is the size of a small building.
[02:28:56.264 --> 02:28:58.685]  This is all one lump.
[02:28:58.685 --> 02:29:01.987]  And update me on the specifics, because I saw the articles last few months.
[02:29:01.987 --> 02:29:03.768]  They've been covering up leaks for 10 months.
[02:29:03.768 --> 02:29:06.170]  They say it's worse than ever at Fukushima.
[02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:08.351]  Absolutely it's worse than anything.
[02:29:08.351 --> 02:29:18.117]  And when you consider all three of these reactors, you're dealing with over 600,000 pounds of this material.
[02:29:18.117 --> 02:29:20.339]  And people are like, well that's a lot of... that's a lot of...
[02:29:21.209 --> 02:29:22.169]  That's a lot of pounds.
[02:29:22.169 --> 02:29:24.150]  I can't wrap my head around it.
[02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:35.175]  Okay, go out in a Walmart parking lot or someplace and count 190 cars, and that's the amount of material that you have melted down.
[02:29:35.175 --> 02:29:38.256]  The equivalent of 190 automobiles melted down.
[02:29:38.256 --> 02:29:40.697]  Because they were storing it right on top of the reactors.
[02:29:40.697 --> 02:29:43.378]  Jerry Peterman, FukushimaUpdateReport.com is our guest.
[02:29:43.378 --> 02:29:47.760]  We're going to get into where this crisis is going and the radiation levels rising in the U.S.
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:49.601]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.601 --> 02:29:52.122]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.122 --> 02:29:58.907]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.907 --> 02:30:00.227]  The experts are clear.
[02:30:00.227 --> 02:30:07.352]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:30:07.352 --> 02:30:13.616]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:30:13.616 --> 02:30:17.218]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:30:17.338 --> 02:30:21.559]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:30:21.559 --> 02:30:26.880]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:27.880]  Not our iodine.
[02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:34.242]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:31:00.053 --> 02:31:05.035]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:05.035 --> 02:31:07.716]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:07.716 --> 02:31:14.739]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:14.739 --> 02:31:17.760]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:20.761]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:20.761 --> 02:31:22.722]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:31:22.722 --> 02:31:25.563]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:25.623 --> 02:31:31.365]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:31.365 --> 02:31:34.866]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:34.866 --> 02:31:37.967]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:31:37.967 --> 02:31:45.269]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:31:59.719 --> 02:32:01.019]  In the near future.
[02:32:01.019 --> 02:32:05.541]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:05.541 --> 02:32:06.741]  Security, alert.
[02:32:06.741 --> 02:32:08.762]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:32:08.762 --> 02:32:12.343]  Analysis, InfoWars building independent media operations.
[02:32:12.343 --> 02:32:17.344]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:32:17.344 --> 02:32:19.925]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:19.925 --> 02:32:22.786]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:22.786 --> 02:32:26.027]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:26.027 --> 02:32:28.308]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:28.308 --> 02:32:28.968]  These people are
[02:32:29.248 --> 02:32:36.549]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:32:36.549 --> 02:32:39.630]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:33:09.173 --> 02:33:21.717]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:21.717 --> 02:33:36.142]  It was just about three weeks ago I saw the headlines that a bunch of the underground facilities they built in New Mexico to store nuclear waste was collapsing into salt mines and was full of salt water and brine.
[02:33:38.737 --> 02:33:47.686]  And then a couple months ago I saw another report where they've got some stored out in California and Nevada, and those areas are collapsing as well.
[02:33:47.686 --> 02:33:49.168]  I mean, it's like a joke!
[02:33:51.181 --> 02:33:53.262]  It's like a joke!
[02:33:53.262 --> 02:34:00.846]  And I want to invite Jerry Peterman up for a full hour in the near future here on the Nightly News, because we should really cover this more.
[02:34:00.846 --> 02:34:06.508]  I've been hammering it and hammering it, but then I'll go a year without really mentioning it, then I'll kind of hammer it for a while.
[02:34:06.508 --> 02:34:16.073]  But we need to be aware of this, because I've got nuclear physicists on, medical doctors, cancer doctors on, and they go, yeah, this will increase our rates of cancer, and it already has.
[02:34:17.622 --> 02:34:24.858]  But I've talked to folks that lived in Europe during Chernobyl, who were in Italy and other areas, for six months to a year they ate produce from the U.S.
[02:34:25.936 --> 02:34:27.618]  Powdered milk from other areas.
[02:34:27.618 --> 02:34:33.984]  They didn't eat the vegetables for six months to a year because they knew it was bioaccumulating from Chernobyl all over Europe.
[02:34:33.984 --> 02:34:41.251]  Nowadays, they don't warn anybody even though there were some levels over 200 times higher than some of the spinach and stuff that was tested in 2011, 2012.
[02:34:41.251 --> 02:34:48.818]  And as our guest said, the FDA would come out with the EPA and others and say, you know what?
[02:34:48.818 --> 02:34:50.220]  We're just going to raise it and say it's safe.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.522]  Why not?
[02:34:53.522 --> 02:34:55.604]  See, they didn't even try to avoid it.
[02:34:55.604 --> 02:35:00.949]  Hey, if you've got fast-growing cells and you're a child, you don't want to get cancer when you're 35 or 40.
[02:35:00.949 --> 02:35:01.690]  Don't, you know.
[02:35:01.690 --> 02:35:02.510]  Sorry, farmers.
[02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:06.434]  You're going to have to, you know, get rid of this produce.
[02:35:06.434 --> 02:35:08.156]  No, they didn't want to do that.
[02:35:08.156 --> 02:35:10.418]  So the world changed, folks.
[02:35:10.418 --> 02:35:16.084]  From Europe not feeding people for six months to a year their food, to now just, you know what?
[02:35:16.892 --> 02:35:21.614]  I mean, even the Soviets had people move out of the Ukraine and areas of Russia nearby Chernobyl.
[02:35:21.614 --> 02:35:24.354]  Now, it's just, stay next to Fukushima.
[02:35:24.354 --> 02:35:31.897]  They got Momby on the left and others on the right like Ann Coulter come out saying, you ought to go in the reactor, it's good for you!
[02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:35.812]  So for the next six, seven minutes, sir, you've got the floor.
[02:35:35.812 --> 02:35:40.715]  Instead of me asking the questions, because you really are a clearinghouse, talking to the scientists, you name it.
[02:35:40.715 --> 02:35:42.596]  What is the latest on Fukushima?
[02:35:42.596 --> 02:35:43.597]  Where is it going?
[02:35:43.597 --> 02:35:45.558]  And the other reactors?
[02:35:45.558 --> 02:35:47.459]  And is there any sanity?
[02:35:47.459 --> 02:35:54.864]  Because now I see all these leftist groups pushing micro-reactors in cities, and how homes might have them in the future, and cars.
[02:35:54.864 --> 02:35:59.908]  I mean, these people seem to be tripling down like the vaccine makers as it shows.
[02:35:59.908 --> 02:36:00.668]  You know what?
[02:36:00.668 --> 02:36:03.250]  We're going to get everybody more vaccines as it shows it's hurting people.
[02:36:04.491 --> 02:36:05.873]  It just seems like an arrogance.
[02:36:05.873 --> 02:36:09.878]  So where is all this going?
[02:36:09.878 --> 02:36:16.646]  I hate to say it, but I think we're all, you know, beer is cold and the game is on, who the blank cares?
[02:36:16.646 --> 02:36:19.850]  We're so mesmerized by the media.
[02:36:21.203 --> 02:36:31.033]  To watch Action with the Stars or, you know, the latest Star Wars movie or whatever it is out there.
[02:36:31.033 --> 02:36:36.098]  I did a survey in Flugerville at a nice mall.
[02:36:43.986 --> 02:36:52.535]  And I asked 100 people about Fukushima, and of the 100 people, 30 had heard about it.
[02:36:52.535 --> 02:36:58.582]  And of those 30, only 5 realized that it was of any consequence whatsoever.
[02:36:59.742 --> 02:37:06.385]  And one fellow told me it was really, really great because his friends all liked it.
[02:37:06.385 --> 02:37:08.946]  And I was a little taken back.
[02:37:08.946 --> 02:37:09.806]  I said, why?
[02:37:09.806 --> 02:37:16.709]  And he said, it's that new sushi place out on 183.
[02:37:16.709 --> 02:37:18.069]  Okay.
[02:37:18.069 --> 02:37:19.870]  I smiled and thanked him.
[02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:24.512]  And one lady blessed me out for not being very well educated since it was over with in 2010.
[02:37:28.686 --> 02:37:34.529]  We have too many things that take our mind off of what we really should be doing.
[02:37:34.529 --> 02:37:39.952]  And frankly, I remember my father being upset with 5% federal income tax.
[02:37:39.952 --> 02:37:41.653]  What would he think now?
[02:37:41.653 --> 02:37:50.998]  And I don't think there's anybody left who will go out and demonstrate in the streets for anything because we're pretty well convinced that none of what we do matters anymore.
[02:37:51.778 --> 02:38:02.727]  And, you know, children, if you ask children, they all think, you know, grade school, basically junior high or high school, they think they're going to be dead anyway.
[02:38:02.727 --> 02:38:07.170]  Things are bad and we've got people scared to the bone.
[02:38:07.170 --> 02:38:10.573]  What can you do when you're when you're frightened?
[02:38:10.573 --> 02:38:14.936]  I gave a list, made a list of things that I felt like, what can we do?
[02:38:15.977 --> 02:38:19.038]  Uh, a few health things, not eating fish and stuff like that.
[02:38:19.038 --> 02:38:28.260]  But I said, one of the things about the average person buying a radiation detector, I don't think it's important to do that for one reason.
[02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:30.481]  They don't understand what they're looking at.
[02:38:30.481 --> 02:38:33.322]  But the main thing is, in the United States,
[02:38:35.396 --> 02:38:51.226]  We are fed so much fear that I think over the long run, fear is going to do more biological damage to us as a society than the radiation that we're going to have over the next 10 years.
[02:38:51.226 --> 02:38:57.229]  An estimate of 100,000 people die of cancer from Fukushima at an elevated rate.
[02:38:57.229 --> 02:39:01.492]  But I think fear is going to take its toll as well.
[02:39:01.492 --> 02:39:03.033]  Nobody knows how to measure that.
[02:39:03.533 --> 02:39:06.014]  Well, Jerry, I think you've hit the nail on the head here.
[02:39:06.014 --> 02:39:13.177]  They've given us learned helplessness and terrified us over things like terrorism, where deer jumping out in front of your car kill more every year than that.
[02:39:13.177 --> 02:39:19.059]  So we're scared of all this stuff like great white sharks eating us, a statistic shows, one of the biggest fears out there.
[02:39:19.059 --> 02:39:20.740]  But five people a year get killed by them.
[02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:24.261]  It's basically almost impossible out of seven and a half billion people to be killed by one of them.
[02:39:24.261 --> 02:39:25.882]  It's like finding a leprechaun.
[02:39:25.882 --> 02:39:27.162]  But people are scared of that.
[02:39:27.162 --> 02:39:30.484]  Meanwhile, real threats people can't seem to get focused on.
[02:39:31.264 --> 02:39:35.112]  And they just think you're trying to scare them like everything else because they feel powerless.
[02:39:35.112 --> 02:39:41.043]  But the truth is, we go through these times where it seems like nothing's happening and suddenly there's a mass awakening.
[02:39:42.153 --> 02:39:43.074]  And things change.
[02:39:43.074 --> 02:39:50.098]  The big problem is we have an elite that doesn't want the public to be active, so the elite can do whatever they want.
[02:39:50.098 --> 02:39:58.602]  And the elite themselves, I think, are so decadent that they've become so megalomaniacal that they think they're invincible.
[02:39:58.602 --> 02:40:04.346]  And I think the radiation level spiking and all the leaks is a symptom of the disease
[02:40:05.795 --> 02:40:14.264]  Of an elite that have become so inbred and so decadent that a lot of their writings talk about, you know, if we don't merge with machines and live forever, so what?
[02:40:14.264 --> 02:40:15.806]  Let's just blow the earth up.
[02:40:15.806 --> 02:40:18.088]  I mean, I think it's evil is what we're dealing with here.
[02:40:19.334 --> 02:40:20.515]  I can't question that.
[02:40:20.515 --> 02:40:30.962]  Alex, I told you a long time ago that I felt like people who work for Tepco or various companies like that are serving soulless entities.
[02:40:30.962 --> 02:40:41.870]  And it still comes down to the Supreme Court has declared that a corporation is a person and can spend whatever money it wants on votes and everything else.
[02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:44.791]  But if that is a person, there is no body
[02:40:45.652 --> 02:40:48.533]  There's no physical entity there.
[02:40:48.533 --> 02:40:53.036]  So what we spiritually would say there is no soul.
[02:40:53.036 --> 02:40:56.477]  So that means there's no conscious conscience.
[02:40:56.477 --> 02:41:01.460]  And we are out there serving these companies.
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:04.862]  The people who are in the nuclear field are and
[02:41:06.383 --> 02:41:14.050]  You're serving something that has no conscience, and it has got to be one of the scariest things on the planet.
[02:41:14.050 --> 02:41:19.636]  What else can you tell me that last 4.2 billion years have produced as a waste?
[02:41:19.636 --> 02:41:21.297]  There's nothing on the planet.
[02:41:21.297 --> 02:41:22.018]  I think you've hit it.
[02:41:22.018 --> 02:41:22.579]  That's it.
[02:41:22.579 --> 02:41:29.445]  We have produced people with all the food and all the liberty we have that are so decadent and so disconnected from the ground reality.
[02:41:30.186 --> 02:41:35.368]  Of the real world, that they just don't care anymore about anybody but themselves.
[02:41:35.368 --> 02:41:53.234]  And I don't lionize the veterans, but people that have been in combat, people that have been through serious things, or aid workers that have been seen starving children, and folks like that, people who have had real suffering or seen it, they at least get wanting to save freedom, and wanting to stand up for others, and wanting to try to be honorable.
[02:41:53.234 --> 02:41:54.054]  Doesn't mean they're perfect.
[02:41:54.614 --> 02:42:00.338]  And that's why the system demonizes them because they know veterans have actually been in the real world.
[02:42:00.338 --> 02:42:05.982]  And they want us all to be these insulated TV heads that aren't part of reality.
[02:42:05.982 --> 02:42:06.943]  And I think that's it.
[02:42:06.943 --> 02:42:12.267]  It's a world of spectators that now look at those of us that just want to build a future.
[02:42:12.267 --> 02:42:15.169]  I mean, I mean, ants save food for the winter.
[02:42:16.803 --> 02:42:18.224]  I mean, I'm not even saying we're special.
[02:42:18.224 --> 02:42:20.786]  We're just not trying to kill ourselves.
[02:42:20.786 --> 02:42:25.350]  And they're so divorced from life that they think we're the bad guys.
[02:42:25.350 --> 02:42:28.753]  Because, you know, like you said, you have people chewing you out going, that was over in 2010.
[02:42:28.753 --> 02:42:31.715]  That problem's solved.
[02:42:31.715 --> 02:42:35.338]  And it didn't even happen in 2010, you dumb woman.
[02:42:35.338 --> 02:42:45.126]  You know, it's the arrogance of these people where their eyes glaze over and they smile and they have these dead shark eyes and they go,
[02:42:46.254 --> 02:42:47.774]  Hell yeah!
[02:42:47.774 --> 02:42:50.315]  It's like they revel in it.
[02:42:50.315 --> 02:42:54.476]  But I guarantee you, you start choking them, they're going to beg for the police and squeal and cry.
[02:42:54.476 --> 02:43:03.378]  It's like they're so self-centered that they don't have any nerve endings into the universe, is the way I'd describe them.
[02:43:03.378 --> 02:43:05.378]  I totally agree, Alex.
[02:43:05.378 --> 02:43:09.359]  You know, they're so disconnected that they don't realize that they're poisoning.
[02:43:09.359 --> 02:43:12.200]  I have a very close friend who said,
[02:43:13.547 --> 02:43:18.369]  Don't these people realize that they're being affected by this material?
[02:43:18.369 --> 02:43:25.451]  He was referring to chemtrails and all the nuclear pollution and that kind of thing.
[02:43:25.451 --> 02:43:29.433]  Don't they realize that they're also being affected and their children?
[02:43:30.802 --> 02:43:32.884]  And I said, I don't understand.
[02:43:32.884 --> 02:43:49.018]  I guess it's like the old whiskey ads that used to be in magazines that always had a skull painted somewhere in the ice cube or something because those people who drank heavy liquor supposedly had a death wish.
[02:43:49.018 --> 02:43:53.382]  And it was a standard thing to put a skull somewhere in the ad.
[02:43:54.872 --> 02:43:57.373]  Maybe that's why it's called Skull and Bones.
[02:43:57.373 --> 02:43:58.333]  It's a death wish.
[02:43:58.333 --> 02:43:58.753]  That's it.
[02:43:58.753 --> 02:44:00.793]  It's a metaphysical rule they've got to tell you.
[02:44:00.793 --> 02:44:05.134]  You know, I know you're close to Austin, and last time you were on about a year ago, I invited you here.
[02:44:05.134 --> 02:44:06.794]  Please come the next two weeks.
[02:44:06.794 --> 02:44:09.035]  We'll do a whole hour and a half, two hours, and take calls.
[02:44:09.035 --> 02:44:10.895]  You can bring any exhibits.
[02:44:10.895 --> 02:44:11.555]  Get here beforehand.
[02:44:11.555 --> 02:44:15.436]  We can put them up on the big screen for TV viewers and really do a special report.
[02:44:15.436 --> 02:44:18.477]  So, Jerry, I hope you can come here in the next few weeks.
[02:44:18.477 --> 02:44:19.237]  I'd be happy to.
[02:44:19.237 --> 02:44:20.137]  Thank you for your work.
[02:44:21.118 --> 02:44:21.939]  Well thank you, sir.
[02:44:21.939 --> 02:44:24.502]  We're all just common sense trying to survive here.
[02:44:24.502 --> 02:44:25.743]  God bless you.
[02:44:25.743 --> 02:44:26.864]  He's thanking me, I'm thanking him.
[02:44:26.864 --> 02:44:29.587]  It'd be like if I looked out and my neighbor's house was on fire.
[02:44:29.587 --> 02:44:34.192]  I'd run over and bang on their door and see if anybody was home and I'd call the fire department.
[02:44:34.192 --> 02:44:35.473]  I don't deserve a medal for that.
[02:44:35.473 --> 02:44:38.196]  I mean, he doesn't deserve a medal.
[02:44:38.196 --> 02:44:41.299]  But compared to the general public, I guess we do.
[02:44:41.299 --> 02:44:43.602]  We've got to hold up that that's what you're supposed to do.
[02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:46.816]  I want to go to your calls.
[02:44:46.816 --> 02:44:52.578]  Francis, thank you for holding, and then Jason and Jay and Tom and Rod.
[02:44:52.578 --> 02:44:54.359]  We'll get to all of you before the broadcast ends.
[02:44:54.359 --> 02:45:10.126]  I'm not going to belabor this long, but if you want to support the broadcast and really get some dynamite products that are the best supplements I've ever come across, I take a couple times a day a squirt of our proprietary vitamin D3, totally organic, tastes great.
[02:45:11.229 --> 02:45:11.970]  It's weird.
[02:45:11.970 --> 02:45:13.471]  Never tasted anything like it.
[02:45:13.471 --> 02:45:14.632]  Super Mill Vitality.
[02:45:14.632 --> 02:45:16.313]  Took three squirts or more of that a day.
[02:45:16.313 --> 02:45:18.214]  Put that in the water.
[02:45:18.214 --> 02:45:19.075]  This is how I take it.
[02:45:19.075 --> 02:45:20.136]  I like to drink it.
[02:45:20.136 --> 02:45:21.517]  It's like a fruit punch.
[02:45:21.517 --> 02:45:23.338]  Our Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12.
[02:45:23.338 --> 02:45:24.219]  The best out there.
[02:45:24.219 --> 02:45:25.159]  Pharmaceutical grade.
[02:45:25.159 --> 02:45:26.961]  At a very low price.
[02:45:26.961 --> 02:45:28.782]  Survival Shield, Niacin, Iodine, X2.
[02:45:28.782 --> 02:45:31.044]  I'm not going to have low energy.
[02:45:31.044 --> 02:45:31.624]  You name it.
[02:45:31.624 --> 02:45:33.406]  But I'm telling you, this is not a game.
[02:45:33.406 --> 02:45:34.626]  Okay?
[02:45:34.626 --> 02:45:34.847]  Okay?
[02:45:35.925 --> 02:45:37.846]  I mean, these are real products.
[02:45:37.846 --> 02:45:41.028]  Get ready to detox when you take the X2 and stuff like that.
[02:45:41.028 --> 02:45:49.813]  Consult a physician beforehand because people are so deficient in this type of stuff that when you finally get it, I mean, there can be some repercussions.
[02:45:49.813 --> 02:45:52.475]  So, we're not selling snake oil, folks.
[02:45:52.475 --> 02:45:57.498]  This is the real stuff that they don't want you to have.
[02:45:57.498 --> 02:46:01.220]  And I have gone from 279 pounds to like 230 or so.
[02:46:04.366 --> 02:46:07.928]  And I got another 25-30 to go, and I'll be my old fighting weight.
[02:46:07.928 --> 02:46:13.931]  I was actually about 185 and I really looked great, but it was really healthy, but I'm not going to try to go down that low.
[02:46:13.931 --> 02:46:16.053]  My medical doctor said, no, look, you're older now.
[02:46:16.053 --> 02:46:17.413]  You just need to get down to 200.
[02:46:17.413 --> 02:46:19.194]  And I'm going to do it!
[02:46:19.194 --> 02:46:24.717]  By the good Lord's graces, tore my Achilles, working out and hiking.
[02:46:24.717 --> 02:46:25.938]  Had to get my hernia fixed.
[02:46:25.938 --> 02:46:26.899]  I had it for 14 years.
[02:46:27.699 --> 02:46:35.802]  No, stuff like that, but I'm getting it all done and getting supercharged in just 45 days by religiously taking the products, not just taking them off and on.
[02:46:35.802 --> 02:46:38.843]  I lost six pounds of fat and gained muscle.
[02:46:38.843 --> 02:46:47.225]  So, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella, and we will sell out of it in the next week or so at current sales rates.
[02:46:47.225 --> 02:46:48.466]  It's an introductory offer.
[02:46:51.189 --> 02:46:57.211]  We now have the Calm Child that Kit Daniels told me to tell folks he took and absolutely knocked him out last night.
[02:46:57.211 --> 02:46:58.952]  But it's not really a knockout.
[02:46:58.952 --> 02:47:03.354]  It's got 20-something known herbs and things that are known to just calm you and smooth you out.
[02:47:03.354 --> 02:47:05.474]  It's great for adults as well.
[02:47:05.474 --> 02:47:08.576]  But Child Ease is the product if you want a calm child.
[02:47:08.576 --> 02:47:10.076]  Try it out for yourself.
[02:47:10.076 --> 02:47:11.337]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:47:12.637 --> 02:47:15.121]  And your purchase, again, funds the operation.
[02:47:15.121 --> 02:47:26.719]  We're running the Alex Challenge Pack at InfoWarsLife.com, where you can get Survival Shield X2, Oxy Powder, and Super Male Vitality, the female sold out, and get free shipping on that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:47:28.334 --> 02:47:30.055]  Or 888-253-3139.

[02:47:35.537 --> 02:47:37.237]  That special runs in perpetuity.
[02:47:37.237 --> 02:47:38.818]  That's just a $3.60 win.
[02:47:38.818 --> 02:47:44.420]  Anything I promote is what I believe in, what I researched, what I personally use, at a very affordable, fair price.
[02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:50.322]  And then you fund a hardcore, vicious operation dedicated to savagely telling the truth and throwing ourselves against the globalists.
[02:47:51.002 --> 02:47:52.302]  And just trusting in Providence.
[02:47:52.302 --> 02:47:56.123]  So we really want to thank all of you out there for your support.
[02:47:56.123 --> 02:47:57.263]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:47:57.263 --> 02:47:59.964]  The books, the videos, the Patriot apparel.
[02:47:59.964 --> 02:48:02.184]  We fund ourselves the old-fashioned way.
[02:48:02.184 --> 02:48:03.144]  High-quality products.
[02:48:03.144 --> 02:48:12.686]  Not taking money from you like Warren Buffett does in bailout money and then giving tens of millions to ABC News to push tax increase propaganda on the middle class.
[02:48:12.686 --> 02:48:17.027]  We don't take your money like filth Warren Buffett.
[02:48:17.027 --> 02:48:20.128]  We open society of freedom.
[02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:24.403]  that counters the fake open societies of George Soros.
[02:48:24.403 --> 02:48:28.206]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:48:28.206 --> 02:48:29.367]  Let's talk to Francis.
[02:48:29.367 --> 02:48:30.147]  Been holding for an hour.
[02:48:30.147 --> 02:48:31.689]  I really appreciate that.
[02:48:31.689 --> 02:48:33.510]  From New York, then Jay and others.
[02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:35.212]  Welcome.
[02:48:35.212 --> 02:48:36.213]  Hey, how are you?
[02:48:36.213 --> 02:48:36.453]  Good.
[02:48:36.453 --> 02:48:38.655]  I would have gone to you earlier, but the phone system was glitching.
[02:48:38.655 --> 02:48:38.935]  Go ahead.
[02:48:40.168 --> 02:48:41.249]  That's not a problem.
[02:48:41.249 --> 02:48:42.910]  I have a couple of questions to ask you.
[02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:50.033]  First of all, about Ted Cruz, I understand that, you know, me personally, Rand Paul is the guy for me, but I have my doubts for him as well.
[02:48:50.033 --> 02:48:50.834]  No, absolutely.
[02:48:50.834 --> 02:48:52.215]  You can't put your trust in any man.
[02:48:52.215 --> 02:48:54.356]  You know, Christ told us, only put trust in God.
[02:48:54.356 --> 02:48:56.137]  I agree with you.
[02:48:56.137 --> 02:48:56.597]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:56.597 --> 02:48:58.218]  I just, he's just too good for me.
[02:48:58.218 --> 02:49:07.043]  I think, like you said, was correct a couple weeks ago, you mentioned that as far as like, you know, he could be saying all the right things, but he could be part of the globalist agenda as well.
[02:49:07.043 --> 02:49:07.683]  Absolutely.
[02:49:07.683 --> 02:49:09.464]  But I mean, we know he's better than Hillary Clinton.
[02:49:11.878 --> 02:49:14.740]  And listen, I'm not a lesser of two evils guy.
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:16.982]  I've just learned to not look a gift horse in the mouth.
[02:49:16.982 --> 02:49:19.004]  I don't put all my hopes in a presidential run.
[02:49:19.004 --> 02:49:23.829]  I say take over locally with ideas and take over with our voting with our dollars.
[02:49:23.829 --> 02:49:28.113]  But yeah, Ted Cruz has been a little too hawkish towards Russia.
[02:49:29.425 --> 02:49:31.527]  Oh, I agree with you 100% on that.
[02:49:31.527 --> 02:49:34.510]  I mean, Chuckie Schumer is basically a globalist puppet.
[02:49:34.510 --> 02:49:35.111]  We all know that.
[02:49:53.567 --> 02:49:59.510]  They would have passed the assault weapons ban and all these bans, but then I think maybe let them go ahead and ban it.
[02:49:59.510 --> 02:50:03.872]  Let's, you know, if they really want to show their cards, but you know, I just, what do you think?
[02:50:06.381 --> 02:50:07.001]  Well, yeah.
[02:50:07.001 --> 02:50:08.642]  I mean, basically, you're right.
[02:50:08.642 --> 02:50:10.444]  I mean, basically, let's reflect on it.
[02:50:10.444 --> 02:50:16.789]  But unfortunately, like you said, we can't trust anyone as far as, you know, if they're going to be legitimate or not.
[02:50:16.789 --> 02:50:18.210]  Well, we've got to hold their feet to the fire.
[02:50:18.210 --> 02:50:21.593]  You know, first things first, John Boehner should not be the Speaker of the House.
[02:50:21.593 --> 02:50:25.035]  John Boehner is a Democratic operative.
[02:50:25.035 --> 02:50:29.519]  He is the rhino definition of a Republican in name only.
[02:50:29.519 --> 02:50:31.260]  He is horrible.
[02:50:31.260 --> 02:50:32.061]  I mean, at least
[02:50:34.175 --> 02:50:36.718]  Michael Moore admits he wants our guns.
[02:50:36.718 --> 02:50:39.120]  Boehner goes along with it, but says he's pro-gun.
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:47.008]  I mean, he's just, he blocked the abortion bill that we had the votes in the House and Senate to ban killing seven-month and eight-month-old babies.
[02:50:47.008 --> 02:50:50.191]  I mean, you know, John Boehner is a baby killer!
[02:50:50.191 --> 02:50:55.497]  John Boehner is a criminal piece of crap who's been involved in criminal operations for 30 years.
[02:50:55.497 --> 02:50:57.339]  He's a compromised rat bastard!
[02:50:59.682 --> 02:51:00.683]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:04.125]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:51:04.125 --> 02:51:05.807]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:51:05.807 --> 02:51:07.748]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:51:07.748 --> 02:51:13.592]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:51:13.592 --> 02:51:14.412]  I know, right?
[02:51:14.412 --> 02:51:15.733]  You love it, too!
[02:51:15.733 --> 02:51:17.174]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:51:17.174 --> 02:51:18.195]  Let's go get some!
[02:51:18.195 --> 02:51:19.916]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:51:19.916 --> 02:51:20.296]  That's 877-886-3653.

[02:51:28.462 --> 02:51:34.046]  Hey everyone, you know Mark and I were talking the other day about Guns80.com and how people really want ghost guns.
[02:51:34.046 --> 02:51:36.107]  They want 100% privacy.
[02:51:36.107 --> 02:51:44.392]  So Guns80.com is allowing you now to call them, give your address, and they'll ship you out with a money order or some very private instrument.
[02:51:44.392 --> 02:51:45.553]  You can work that out with them.
[02:51:45.553 --> 02:51:49.596]  They'll ship you out a gun in like a brown paper wrapper so no one even knows you have it.
[02:51:49.596 --> 02:51:50.696]  No records will be kept.
[02:51:50.696 --> 02:51:52.057]  It'll be 100% private.
[02:51:52.057 --> 02:51:52.978]  But you gotta call them.
[02:51:52.978 --> 02:51:53.438]  844-2GUNS80.
[02:51:53.438 --> 02:51:53.478]  844-248-6780.
[02:51:58.160 --> 02:51:59.121]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:51:59.121 --> 02:51:59.641]  Good, brother.
[02:51:59.641 --> 02:52:01.602]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:52:01.602 --> 02:52:03.183]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:52:03.183 --> 02:52:07.365]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:52:07.365 --> 02:52:08.106]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:52:08.106 --> 02:52:12.228]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:52:12.228 --> 02:52:20.253]  SuperMill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:52:20.573 --> 02:52:23.797]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[02:52:23.797 --> 02:52:25.339]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:52:25.339 --> 02:52:28.262]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:52:28.262 --> 02:52:30.044]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:52:30.044 --> 02:52:35.350]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[02:52:35.350 --> 02:52:37.872]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:52:37.872 --> 02:52:49.880]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:56.825]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[02:52:57.979 --> 02:52:59.920]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:03.541]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:53:03.541 --> 02:53:04.902]  A pair of scissors.
[02:53:04.902 --> 02:53:10.685]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:53:10.685 --> 02:53:15.627]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:53:15.627 --> 02:53:16.607]  The phone line.
[02:53:16.607 --> 02:53:21.849]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:53:21.849 --> 02:53:25.591]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:53:25.751 --> 02:53:29.075]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:53:29.075 --> 02:53:31.539]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[02:53:31.539 --> 02:53:35.884]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.

[02:54:06.365 --> 02:54:10.867]  Let's not forget there are a lot of well-meaning conservatives and liberals like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:54:12.953 --> 02:54:18.317]  He's come out and said that there is a vaccine-linked holocaust with millions of children being brainwashed.
[02:54:18.317 --> 02:54:22.760]  The article is on InfoWars.com and he's being demonized and attacked.
[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:27.843]  The food babe, Vani Hari, is being attacked all over because she's effective and she's telling the truth.
[02:54:27.843 --> 02:54:31.646]  Hey McDonald's, please take the silly putty plastic plasticizer out of your food!
[02:54:31.646 --> 02:54:34.568]  I mean, it's there.
[02:54:34.568 --> 02:54:35.189]  They admit it.
[02:54:35.189 --> 02:54:35.769]  Take it out.
[02:54:35.769 --> 02:54:36.950]  Don't demonize Vani Hari.
[02:54:39.124 --> 02:54:43.145]  So we gotta stand with those that stand with us to tell the truth.
[02:54:43.145 --> 02:54:50.087]  The Czarnev living brother, convicted in Boston Marathon bombing, said he was not guilty, but they basically cut his larynx out.
[02:54:50.087 --> 02:54:53.188]  And then his lawyer came out and said he was guilty on the news a few weeks ago.
[02:54:53.188 --> 02:54:59.009]  Boy, with defense lawyers like that, he was totally set up, ladies and gentlemen, to sell the police state.
[02:54:59.009 --> 02:55:00.890]  His brother worked for the CIA.
[02:55:00.890 --> 02:55:03.030]  The Russians blew his cover two years before.
[02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.991]  The government lied about it.
[02:55:03.991 --> 02:55:05.411]  It all came out.
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:09.661]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:09.661 --> 02:55:14.845]  And we had the Secret Service, even though Obama wasn't in town, come to press conferences with our reporter there.
[02:55:14.845 --> 02:55:16.606]  You saw it on National News.
[02:55:16.606 --> 02:55:18.648]  We ought to do a recap of that tonight on The Nightly News.
[02:55:18.648 --> 02:55:28.475]  Dan Bodondi and tell him, and tell the press, do not look at his material, do not look at his pictures of the contractors and the black backpacks.
[02:55:28.475 --> 02:55:30.277]  And I'm not saying the contractors were involved.
[02:55:30.277 --> 02:55:31.157]  It was a drill.
[02:55:31.157 --> 02:55:32.759]  We know it was on the news.
[02:55:34.008 --> 02:55:40.571]  They ran a drill, so that they could get in whoever really did it, and in case they got caught, then they're a part of the drill.
[02:55:40.571 --> 02:55:43.273]  We know it was fake.
[02:55:43.273 --> 02:55:45.294]  The other Czarneck brother was murdered in front of everybody.
[02:55:45.294 --> 02:55:46.174]  He didn't kill a cop.
[02:55:46.174 --> 02:55:48.335]  That all came out.
[02:55:48.335 --> 02:55:50.756]  I don't know what happened, but it's fake.
[02:55:50.756 --> 02:55:53.018]  He's now been convicted.
[02:55:53.018 --> 02:55:55.139]  Jay in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:55:55.139 --> 02:55:57.220]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:55:57.220 --> 02:55:58.760]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:01.062]  I want to comment on Jade Helm 15.
[02:56:02.435 --> 02:56:03.996]  And see what you think of this scenario.
[02:56:03.996 --> 02:56:11.642]  It stinks to me like Soros in the Ukraine and Eric Holder with Fast and Furious and OKC.
[02:56:11.642 --> 02:56:12.363]  Picture this.
[02:56:12.363 --> 02:56:19.969]  The government brings the troops into the area and then they come under fire by provocateurs that shoot them and shoot civilians.
[02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:22.951]  Sure, they should know that I would talk about the drill as I always do.
[02:56:22.951 --> 02:56:28.636]  Then I'd have the military attack by their own people and blame it on me, just like Underwood would throw a brick through his own window.
[02:56:28.636 --> 02:56:28.756]  Yep.
[02:56:29.924 --> 02:56:36.768]  And then the provocateurs leave in the darkness, and then it's blamed on gun owners.
[02:56:36.768 --> 02:56:40.790]  And the way to avoid this is have the troops train on base.
[02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:41.110]  That's right.
[02:56:41.110 --> 02:56:42.511]  This can happen.
[02:56:42.511 --> 02:56:52.036]  And this is exactly what Soros did in the Ukraine, where those provocateurs shot police and they shot civilians to cause the agitation.
[02:56:52.036 --> 02:56:55.278]  And then this would be a call to villainize gun owners.
[02:56:56.005 --> 02:57:07.873]  And to move things forward, there's also a guy who had a chart of, I think it was Russian groups, that were surrounding the area of the James Hill operation, that actually like looped around it.
[02:57:07.873 --> 02:57:09.054]  They're all in small towns.
[02:57:09.054 --> 02:57:12.957]  And the guy goes, well, why are these guys all on the outskirts of these small towns?
[02:57:12.957 --> 02:57:14.058]  Why are they doing that for?
[02:57:14.058 --> 02:57:15.699]  And I thought that was interesting.
[02:57:15.699 --> 02:57:21.663]  But the thing of it is, is with them bringing the troops in, they're in control of the time, the territory, and the tactics.
[02:57:22.145 --> 02:57:23.806]  All in one time.
[02:57:23.806 --> 02:57:27.888]  And that's what you're going to be if you're going to be a hunter and control the moment.
[02:57:27.888 --> 02:57:32.109]  So I just wanted to see what you think on it.
[02:57:32.109 --> 02:57:32.990]  But that's what came to me.
[02:57:34.412 --> 02:57:36.354]  Anything is possible with these globalists.
[02:57:36.354 --> 02:57:38.115]  But, I mean, the general public doesn't think like that.
[02:57:38.115 --> 02:57:42.819]  Like, I watched House of Cards, again, the first season, because I've had surgery and I was taking off some time.
[02:57:42.819 --> 02:57:47.343]  It was clear that he threw the brick through his own window to blame his opposition.
[02:57:47.343 --> 02:57:52.026]  And I'm sitting around, people watching, and they go, Alex, don't think it's going to be... And, of course, at the end, it was staged.
[02:57:52.026 --> 02:57:56.790]  The public doesn't think like that, even though nine times out of ten stuff's a false flag.
[02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:58.031]  Historically.
[02:57:58.031 --> 02:57:59.632]  World War II started with a false flag.
[02:57:59.632 --> 02:58:01.854]  Vietnam with a false flag.
[02:58:01.854 --> 02:58:03.616]  The Spanish-American War with a false flag.
[02:58:05.039 --> 02:58:06.500]  It's just over and over again.
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:07.001]  God bless you.
[02:58:07.001 --> 02:58:07.701]  I appreciate your call.
[02:58:07.701 --> 02:58:09.462]  We're going to go to Overdrive.
[02:58:09.462 --> 02:58:10.123]  One minute break.
[02:58:10.123 --> 02:58:11.143]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:11.143 --> 02:58:13.985]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free video feeds.
[02:58:13.985 --> 02:58:18.308]  We're going to go to Tom, and then Jason, and then Rod.
[02:58:18.308 --> 02:58:21.510]  I may have time to get to Mary, but she's been holding only about five minutes.
[02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:22.390]  The other's been holding longer.
[02:58:22.390 --> 02:58:24.532]  So I'm going to get to Tom, everybody.
[02:58:24.532 --> 02:58:25.392]  So start your engines.
[02:58:27.858 --> 02:58:29.999]  We're obviously in the main transmission now.
[02:58:29.999 --> 02:58:32.101]  Lord willing, don't take this show for granted.
[02:58:32.101 --> 02:58:34.242]  They're trying to shut down alternative media everywhere.
[02:58:34.242 --> 02:58:35.864]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:35.864 --> 02:58:36.524]  Central.
[02:58:36.524 --> 02:58:40.827]  Please support our local Eminem affiliates, our local sponsors, or become a sponsor.
[02:58:40.827 --> 02:58:42.488]  God bless you all.
[02:58:42.488 --> 02:58:44.870]  If you are watching or listening, you are the resistance.
[02:58:48.943 --> 02:58:58.607]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:58:58.607 --> 02:59:08.532]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:59:08.532 --> 02:59:11.453]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:59:11.673 --> 02:59:11.953]  I think?
[02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:28.532]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:11.232 --> 03:00:12.752]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:12.752 --> 03:00:20.314]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:20.314 --> 03:00:25.015]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:25.015 --> 03:00:25.915]  Look at these headlines.
[03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:32.957]  Government demands father demolish cardboard fort he built for his kids, but they'll let the foreign banks rob trillions, let the illegals run around above the law.
[03:00:32.957 --> 03:00:36.277]  It's all about impacting law-abiding citizens.
[03:00:36.277 --> 03:00:38.598]  Tom in West Virginia, you're on the air.
[03:00:38.598 --> 03:00:38.978]  Go ahead.
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:41.181]  Yes, and thank you.
[03:00:41.181 --> 03:00:42.042]  Bless you, Alex.
[03:00:42.042 --> 03:00:44.223]  We enjoy listening to your show.
[03:00:44.223 --> 03:00:54.311]  I'll make it quick because I know you're off the air, but I think Jerry hit the point on the head, and I think we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg as far as Fukushima goes.
[03:00:54.311 --> 03:00:58.614]  The nuclear reactors here aren't even guarded, so it would only take a couple of bombs.
[03:00:58.614 --> 03:01:00.896]  They have all these underground bunkers built.
[03:01:00.896 --> 03:01:02.736]  Well, they think knowing about it is work.
[03:01:02.736 --> 03:01:03.517]  No, it's fun to fight tyranny.
[03:01:03.517 --> 03:01:04.097]  It's fun to be informed.
[03:01:04.097 --> 03:01:05.977]  These people are not alive.
[03:01:05.977 --> 03:01:06.517]  I mean, it's scary.
[03:01:29.569 --> 03:01:30.289]  It is.
[03:01:30.289 --> 03:01:34.170]  And it's like, you know, that they don't even realize.
[03:01:34.170 --> 03:01:42.232]  And I think some of it is, like Jerry said, you've got so much going on on TV, and so many, who needs 450 TV channels to watch?
[03:01:42.232 --> 03:01:43.873]  That takes the mind off of it.
[03:01:43.873 --> 03:01:47.514]  They're worrying about getting just from paycheck to paycheck to feed their families.
[03:01:47.514 --> 03:01:51.495]  So the government's manipulated it to a point that they're controlling it already.
[03:01:51.495 --> 03:01:56.696]  That's it, now the taxes are so high, they're saying, turn your guns in and we'll safer get your taxes.
[03:01:58.214 --> 03:02:13.980]  And the other thing that was surprising to me is you know they've got CERN from what I heard up and going and the last blood moon is in September and I heard one of the scientists talking and she said well it would be about a year before they could find out anything or it could be in September.
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:18.181]  So I'm actually wondering if we even have to worry about the election, the next election.
[03:02:18.181 --> 03:02:21.983]  Well we know the elites are obsessed with astrology and astrophysics.
[03:02:22.603 --> 03:02:22.923]  Hi Alex.
[03:02:22.923 --> 03:02:24.284]  I was wondering, um,
[03:02:48.737 --> 03:02:57.582]  Was there ever a bulletin or a recall or any type of formal explanation given by Mercedes-Benz for Michael Hastings' assassination?
[03:02:57.582 --> 03:02:57.903]  Nope!
[03:02:57.903 --> 03:03:16.354]  I mean, he said, I'm being chased by a special federal unit, I'm running for my life, told friends and family, they blew his car up, and then we, I mean, I know folks, Biggs was really good friends with him, went to the funeral, the wife was all freaked out, I'm gonna do something about it, I'm gonna stop him, and then she goes on TV and says, his car was on fire, he's loving, I love the government,
[03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:25.343]  And of course, she worked for the National Security Council as one of only two assistants in the actual council rooms.
[03:03:25.343 --> 03:03:28.904]  And folks, the National Security Council runs the show.
[03:03:28.904 --> 03:03:31.265]  It is the top of the pyramid.
[03:03:31.265 --> 03:03:36.286]  And General Jones, when he ran it, said, I take my daily orders from Henry Kissinger.
[03:03:36.286 --> 03:03:44.889]  So, I mean, his, I'm not going to say, I mean, clearly Hastings was some type of commando, and his wife is a spook as well, if you ask me.
[03:03:44.889 --> 03:03:45.269]  What do you think?
[03:03:46.823 --> 03:03:48.044]  Well, I do.
[03:03:48.044 --> 03:03:51.867]  I think it's an atrocity what happened to him and others like him, like Gary Webb and Aaron Schwartz.
[03:03:51.867 --> 03:04:00.213]  But why is it, if I owned a Mercedes-Benz, I'd like to know, well, hey, this car just happens to explode and fly down the street.
[03:04:00.213 --> 03:04:01.354]  Well, it's a flying carpet.
[03:04:01.354 --> 03:04:02.575]  No, I agree.
[03:04:02.575 --> 03:04:03.175]  Exactly.
[03:04:03.175 --> 03:04:07.519]  We never heard why that car, I mean, if a Chevy blew up like that, it'd be a recall.
[03:04:07.519 --> 03:04:09.080]  Yeah.
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:09.540]  Exactly.
[03:04:09.540 --> 03:04:10.661]  I mean, look at the Pintos in the 70s.
[03:04:12.498 --> 03:04:15.321]  You know, like I said, if I owned a Benz, I'd really want to know.
[03:04:15.321 --> 03:04:18.204]  I'd be like, you know what, I want to get rid of this car now, ASAP.
[03:04:18.204 --> 03:04:26.992]  So, Benz and all these other companies like GE is with the Mark reactors in Fukushima, they're all complicit in this fascist, in this fascist operation.
[03:04:26.992 --> 03:04:28.213]  I agree with you.
[03:04:28.213 --> 03:04:29.675]  I apologize to Rod and Mary.
[03:04:29.675 --> 03:04:31.437]  If you want to call back tomorrow.
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:35.383]  And tell John, hey, I was left on hold the other day.
[03:04:35.383 --> 03:04:37.886]  Whenever you can get back in, you'll go to the head of the line.
[03:04:37.886 --> 03:04:39.247]  We're out of time.
[03:04:39.247 --> 03:04:40.709]  Thanks for putting up with me, folks.
[03:04:40.709 --> 03:04:43.251]  I'm just a watchman on the wall screaming bloody murder.
[03:04:43.251 --> 03:04:47.376]  Don't claim I get it all right or have all the answers, but we all know things are getting crazy.
[03:04:47.376 --> 03:04:49.878]  So you don't have to be perfect either.
[03:04:49.878 --> 03:04:54.022]  Just ring the alarm, warn people, shake the public out of their trance.
[03:04:54.022 --> 03:04:55.484]  Don't get too mad at them.
[03:04:55.484 --> 03:04:56.925]  These are victims of mind control.
[03:04:56.925 --> 03:04:57.726]  Feel sorry for them.
[03:04:57.726 --> 03:04:58.127]  Pray for them.
