[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.720]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.040]  the federal government came out yesterday and we talked about it some but not
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.680]  enough and said you know what increased radiation from Fukushima is now hitting
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.720]  the west coast but it's been a while since we've had him on but he interviews
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.000]  all the scientists the experts people on the ground in the United States in
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  northern Mexico in Canada up in Alaska but also in Japan Jerry Peterman a
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.800]  Fukushima update report.com is joining us in the third hour today we need to
[01:06.800 --> 01:13.160]  focus in on Fukushima because it's a big issue in and of itself but at the same
[01:13.160 --> 01:21.680]  time atomic accidents nuclear accidents now are much more frequent but are
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.560]  swept under the rug and their magnitude is increasing exponentially and the
[01:26.560 --> 01:32.800]  response to them is completely watered down it shows a very exterministic
[01:32.800 --> 01:40.300]  nihilistic satanic anti-planet anti-human anti-life attitude that quite
[01:40.300 --> 01:48.840]  frankly fits into the whole system the whole pantheon the whole spectrum of
[01:48.840 --> 01:59.560]  globalist hellraiser galactic hoodlism hoodlumism I'm trying to think of the
[01:59.560 --> 02:06.760]  right word galactic vandalism that we see going on by the people running the
[02:06.760 --> 02:11.760]  show so it's been picked up by the statesman journal and a lot of other
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.640]  publications on the west coast but very whitewashy we've got all these other
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.680]  reactors leaking around the world over 90 percent something like 92 percent of
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.440]  reactors the feds admit in the United States alone are leaking they're supposed
[02:25.440 --> 02:29.600]  to be retired for 30 years they're 40 plus years operating many of them and
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.040]  it's just a ticking time bomb that's already gone off but because it's a
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.200]  soft kill weapon and it doesn't kill you in a week or a month or even a year in
[02:37.200 --> 02:41.200]  most cases and we just see the cancer rates climb and the rest of it so we're
[02:41.200 --> 02:46.960]  spending an entire hour looking at this threat and other soft kill threats that
[02:46.960 --> 02:53.280]  are going on there's obviously a lot of other news to get to Democrats say the
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.120]  IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns and the new thing they want to pass
[02:58.120 --> 03:01.640]  a law to do this started going on if they want to have a law to offer to get
[03:01.640 --> 03:05.560]  rid of your tax bill if you turn your guns in and agree to not own guns so see
[03:05.560 --> 03:11.400]  the the actuary of the economy where you basically cannot operate unless you
[03:11.400 --> 03:14.400]  submit to their social engineering we're gonna get into that article on
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.080]  info wars.com from bis pack review of course it's the big news since
[03:19.080 --> 03:22.240]  yesterday we're gonna talk about it and play the video South Carolina officer
[03:22.240 --> 03:28.400]  is charged with murder of Walter Scott and the cop pulls him over the guy runs
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.280]  he shoots him in the back and then drops a taser on him claiming the guy tried to
[03:32.280 --> 03:41.280]  take his taser and he is being indicted because a bystander shot video and I
[03:41.280 --> 03:48.760]  tell you it is this culture of covering up crime by police that the feds are
[03:48.760 --> 03:53.200]  pushing at one level so they can then come in when the crisis reaches a
[03:53.200 --> 03:59.200]  fever pitch and federalize everything in the name of stopping the problem but the
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.880]  truth is this surveillance society cuts both ways and there's more news out
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.320]  today dealing with the national security agency learning everything it
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.120]  basically is done criminally from the drug enforcement agency DEA tracked
[04:13.120 --> 04:19.240]  billions of calls in the last 20 years basically every phone call illegally and
[04:19.240 --> 04:23.320]  then use it to plan evidence on folks you name it that's your loving loving
[04:23.320 --> 04:28.320]  feds who actually deal the drugs the DEA is over shipping in the narcotics in
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.120]  this country even more so than the CIA then their job again is just like
[04:34.120 --> 04:37.600]  Walmart will lobby to have a local farmers market shut down in the city
[04:37.600 --> 04:43.240]  they'll lobby pay off the city council with campaign contributions to shut down
[04:43.240 --> 04:48.160]  a farmer's market the DEA is there to shut down anybody bringing anything in
[04:48.160 --> 04:51.800]  that they didn't get a big juicy cut up at the federal dessert for I talk about
[04:51.800 --> 04:57.280]  that as well the latest on Iran the economy and so much more

[08:21.480 --> 08:47.360]  the GCN radio network
[08:47.360 --> 08:56.800]  ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday already the eighth day of April 2015 I'm
[08:56.800 --> 09:01.000]  your host Alex Jones we're gonna be here for the next three hours live
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.400]  broadcasting worldwide again thank you so much for joining us today we have the
[09:08.400 --> 09:15.360]  gentleman that heads up the Fukushima report Fukushima update report Jerry
[09:15.360 --> 09:21.320]  Peterman joining us he stays on top of it probably unlike anybody else out there
[09:21.320 --> 09:26.400]  and we've got these new reports out of the oceanographic institution at Woods
[09:26.400 --> 09:32.920]  Hole that's basically NOAA seaborn radiation now slamming at intense
[09:32.920 --> 09:38.880]  levels into the West Coast but they're basically whitewashing at Fukushima
[09:38.880 --> 09:45.840]  radiation has reached North American shores that's out of the journal
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.760]  statesman and other publications USA Today and others we're going to be going
[09:50.760 --> 09:58.120]  over that in the third hour also look at this report out of the LA Times of all
[09:58.120 --> 10:06.880]  places NASA says we'll find alien life in 10 to 20 years and of course Stephen
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.680]  Hawking says what are you doing seeing these transmissions out to deep space
[10:11.680 --> 10:19.240]  telling everybody where we're at who knows what's really out there or is this
[10:19.240 --> 10:27.440]  all just a hologram so we're gonna be breaking that report down Democrats say
[10:27.440 --> 10:34.920]  IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns we're gonna get into the South
[10:34.920 --> 10:40.440]  Carolina officer charged with murder of Walter Scott as he executes he was
[10:40.440 --> 10:43.640]  shooting him in the back and then planting a taser on him and putting out
[10:43.640 --> 10:49.560]  the false report that he'd gone for his taser the entire frame up caught on
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.280]  video and that's why they're trying to pass laws all over the country that you
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.040]  can't video tape the police or anybody else I think things like this are good
[10:57.040 --> 11:03.320]  this will run corrupt officers out also people that just want to kill it's well
[11:03.320 --> 11:06.960]  known about 10% of the military get in just because they want to kill people not
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.560]  because of family or because they want to serve the country or because they want
[11:10.560 --> 11:16.560]  a better way of life and scholarships what about 10% getting is I want to kill
[11:16.560 --> 11:19.400]  people in cold blood and in my experience of the statistics show this we
[11:19.400 --> 11:22.320]  should do a whole report on it because people like George Soros are trying to
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.320]  exacerbate this problem and create a race war and anti-police operation which
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.040]  then they can federalize out of the crisis but the statistics came out just
[11:30.040 --> 11:35.880]  a few months ago that you're twice as likely to be shot by police statistically
[11:35.880 --> 11:44.200]  not just because of the numbers but per capita per 100 whites 100 blacks 100
[11:44.200 --> 11:48.520]  Hispanics you're more likely to be shot if you're wider Hispanic those numbers
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.280]  are about the same then if you're black and of course the real reason for that
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.120]  is not good cops try to stay out of the really dangerous black neighborhoods
[11:58.120 --> 12:05.120]  they don't respond and they don't really go in head first because they don't want
[12:05.120 --> 12:11.080]  to be politically blamed or indicted or set up and so they basically slow call
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.160]  the dangerous inner city areas like South Chicago and then they disintegrate
[12:16.160 --> 12:19.400]  into total hell and of course most the cops in the south side of Chicago on
[12:19.400 --> 12:24.320]  record are black they act just like white cops they don't show up very quick
[12:24.320 --> 12:28.320]  because they don't want to be blamed with shooting somebody for a racial
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.040]  reason this cop who shot this black guy in the back because he was running away
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.760]  had what I would call basically hunter fever in most cases that's what it is
[12:36.760 --> 12:39.880]  they just can't stand that somebody's running away from them instead of
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.040]  chasing them down or calling a helicopter it was in a major city that had
[12:43.040 --> 12:46.600]  multiple helicopters I mean they have the person's car you're going to get
[12:46.600 --> 12:53.120]  them he killed him and then when oops what'd I do better plant a taser on them
[12:53.120 --> 12:57.400]  claiming he took it so we'll be breaking that down coming up at the bottom of the
[12:57.400 --> 13:02.240]  hour and that ties in to the other black male a few years ago remember out in
[13:02.240 --> 13:07.880]  California in San Francisco on the dark train wasn't even part of the
[13:07.880 --> 13:10.880]  altercation they pull everybody off the train line them up they're searching
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.920]  everybody like it's the Soviet Union put the guy in handcuffs and the cop just
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.040]  pulls a gun out shoots him right in the back hole bloodedly and they make it up
[13:20.040 --> 13:23.680]  and say you tried to take his gun away you see the cops on video grabbing
[13:23.680 --> 13:27.600]  everybody's cell phones but somebody in another train had stopped videotaped it
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.200]  and the train like a movie rolls away right as the cops turn towards that
[13:31.200 --> 13:37.320]  train and figure out oh wait a minute there might be cameras on there now
[13:37.320 --> 13:43.120]  they're moving with Apple and with Samsung and others droid you name it
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.400]  where there's kill switches the last three years on all the new phones and
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.000]  these are now in the threat fusion centers the average cops have been getting
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.920]  access to it you have to say well where you hit a button and on a street level
[13:53.920 --> 13:58.880]  or a grid level or part of a city or a whole city or a whole state all the
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.120]  phones stop working entirely or the camera functions turn off I told you
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.400]  about that ten years ago it's now in the news last year and this year because
[14:08.400 --> 14:12.360]  they're rolling out with it operationally at the homeland security level
[14:12.360 --> 14:17.960]  and that's the problem with what they called for in the New York Times yesterday
[14:17.960 --> 14:23.080]  what they called for an MIT magazine yesterday and what BMW you called for
[14:23.080 --> 14:33.120]  yesterday is the fact that when you cut humans out of driving cars or you cut
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.520]  humans out of flying planes as the answer to kamikaze pilots that is a
[14:37.520 --> 14:41.040]  basically non-existent problem in the history of air travel maybe once or
[14:41.040 --> 14:45.800]  twice it's happened for somebody tries to kill their passengers deliberately the
[14:45.800 --> 14:49.360]  answer isn't find out why he did it why he was on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[14:49.360 --> 14:55.640]  prozac class like every other person who does something screwball seems to be the
[14:55.640 --> 15:00.640]  answer is get rid of pilots entirely who stops hackers who stops rogue
[15:00.640 --> 15:07.400]  government people who stops people in the system instead of hijacking one jet
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.000]  and crashing it now when you centralize things you can hijack all the jets and
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  crash them what if aliens show up with advanced technology and know how to
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.520]  instantly hack all of our computers what they can do with all these smart meters
[15:21.520 --> 15:24.560]  and Trojan horses built and everything and I'm not saying that's going to
[15:24.560 --> 15:29.880]  happen just start thinking about how you put an armored cockpit door in and now
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.080]  it lets a crazy copilot kill everybody one security fix causes a whole other
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.720]  string of problems that's why the answer is an open free swashbuckling
[15:40.720 --> 15:47.040]  frontier economy that goes into space that's what empowers humans every
[15:47.040 --> 15:53.880]  philosophers known it in fact it was even on a fortune cookie the other day I
[15:53.880 --> 15:58.520]  think I shaved it that they were basically quoting Victor Hugo the French
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.880]  philosopher and statesman that adversity makes men prosperity makes
[16:03.880 --> 16:16.760]  monsters and it's absolutely true I put it my wallet but I can't find it that we
[16:16.760 --> 16:22.280]  want to build a world that challenges humans I remember 15 16 years ago they
[16:22.280 --> 16:30.280]  began banning dodgeball and I said they will now ban wrestling touching hugging
[16:30.280 --> 16:37.480]  shaking hands then they'll start trying to restrict contact sports and now coast
[16:37.480 --> 16:44.440]  to coast in most school systems there is no dodgeball then there's no tag there's
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.120]  no touch football and now there's no running at recess I see that article
[16:49.120 --> 16:59.080]  every week we're a new school district announces no one can run at recess in
[16:59.080 --> 17:06.960]  the playground from elementary up and no one can touch and that's the new
[17:06.960 --> 17:10.360]  socialist thing that parents are telling their children even if they're not
[17:10.360 --> 17:16.480]  fighting they say you can't hug each other or touch each other in their homes
[17:16.480 --> 17:22.560]  it's all prisoner training dehumanization training the fake
[17:22.560 --> 17:28.320]  feminism all of it is about breaking up the human community it's so simple it's
[17:28.320 --> 17:34.560]  so crystal clear we have to empower humanity we have to believe in humanity
[17:34.560 --> 17:39.600]  we have to see how amazing humanity is to then reach for the stars but if you
[17:39.600 --> 17:45.120]  tell people they're crud and they're ugly and they're bad all day unless you
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.880]  conform to the system the only way you're beautiful is to work in the system
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.880]  and to comply with the system and then you can be held up as an example of
[17:52.880 --> 17:57.960]  something good that's what collectivism and statism is all about and it kills
[17:57.960 --> 18:02.240]  the individual it kills free will it kills understanding that you're alive
[18:02.240 --> 18:07.720]  only once and part of this amazing experience and this incredible destiny
[18:07.720 --> 18:13.120]  and that we're all interconnected they've trained the public to be so
[18:13.120 --> 18:20.280]  self-serving so narcissistic so envious so jealous that they think if they
[18:20.280 --> 18:24.840]  stand up for their fellow man or do anything or or stick their head up above
[18:24.840 --> 18:29.360]  the grass or stand up for any issue that they're weak they're a loser that you get
[18:29.360 --> 18:33.480]  ahead by screwing everyone over that you get ahead by being a manipulate of
[18:33.480 --> 18:38.400]  liar that you get ahead by being a piece of garbage you can only do that for a
[18:38.400 --> 18:43.560]  time like cancer going through the body if cancer had a consciousness it would
[18:43.560 --> 18:47.520]  believe it was dominant it would believe it was powerful for a season of six

[19:21.880 --> 19:29.120]  message it's very sick it's a psychic virus and people sit there who are
[19:29.120 --> 19:34.000]  powerless and believe acting like a sociopath or psychopath going to give

[24:17.720 --> 24:23.040]  coming up in the next segment we're gonna look at the militarization of police
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.440]  in this country and go back to the Phoenix project that was partially
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.560]  declassified in the 80s that was carried out in Vietnam and the Phoenix
[24:32.560 --> 24:39.200]  project is a precursor to the operations carried out by basically above
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.480]  special forces groups here inside the United States and worldwide and yes the
[24:44.480 --> 24:49.640]  major groups because they're even larger than the special forces groups that are
[24:49.640 --> 24:54.440]  known of are basically above special forces and they're beyond the
[24:54.440 --> 25:00.400]  contractors as well and more and more of that shadow government army is
[25:00.400 --> 25:08.440]  becoming public but I want to break down the shadow assassin army with an
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.200]  excellent John Ballin report that I'll augment with some other intel tying it
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.760]  into the Phoenix program and Senator Kerry not John Kerry the other senator
[25:17.760 --> 25:24.600]  who was involved in the Phoenix project so that is all coming up torture
[25:24.600 --> 25:29.200]  assassinations you name it that's why one of the former top Cuban exiles
[25:29.200 --> 25:33.360]  anti-communist went public last week and said I'm worried about Jade Helm I saw
[25:33.360 --> 25:37.920]  the footage here in Florida that's training to round us up but I told the
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.040]  crew and I told the listeners part of Jade Helm will then be announced this
[25:42.040 --> 25:47.360]  big now 10 state it was seven state then eight state this 10 state operation
[25:47.360 --> 25:52.600]  will be announced and they'll have dirty bomb and decontamination for chemical
[25:52.600 --> 25:56.480]  attacks on the news that's totally legitimate out of the Department of
[25:56.480 --> 26:02.200]  Ordnance Disposal of the Army because it's not my first rodeo every time we
[26:02.200 --> 26:06.720]  catch Delta Force doing takeover drills of the city of San Antonio or Kingsville
[26:06.720 --> 26:12.920]  or Houston or doing it in East St. Louis or then they'll have a report the next
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.880]  week look the army was out helping firefighters deal with a dirty bomb
[26:17.880 --> 26:23.600]  sure enough they announced yesterday that Jade Helms a bunch of dirty bomb
[26:23.600 --> 26:30.200]  drills I mean they run the same plays to brainwash the public over and over
[26:30.200 --> 26:34.800]  again so that's coming up in the next segment there is just an over-the-top
[26:34.800 --> 26:40.680]  headline on drudgereport.com it's also on info wars.com you can't miss it on
[26:40.680 --> 26:46.640]  drudgereport.com Cheney Obama wants to make wants to take America down such a
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.520]  stunning headline I can't even read it correctly Cheney Obama wants to take
[26:50.520 --> 26:57.120]  America down well that's actually true and everybody knows I'm not a fan of
[26:57.120 --> 27:00.680]  Dick Cheney and his Patriot Act and his police state his drug war but the daily
[27:00.680 --> 27:04.960]  caller has the headline and there's video of this we need to get that video I
[27:04.960 --> 27:08.680]  want to play it coming up the next segment Cheney President Obama wants to
[27:08.680 --> 27:16.600]  take America down he told the Hugh Hewitt show Tuesday night former Vice
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.320]  President Dick Cheney said the President Obama's actions on the world stage
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.600]  exemplify president who wants to take America down regardless of what you think
[27:24.600 --> 27:32.280]  of Dick Cheney that's a true statement Obama really is and this is a blind spot
[27:32.280 --> 27:38.040]  I had I thought Obama would be a fake globalist liberal and I thought that he
[27:38.040 --> 27:41.400]  really was just an establishment insider who wanted to bankrupt the middle
[27:41.400 --> 27:45.240]  class and consolidate power but still keep the American Empire going he
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.920]  actually is phasing us into the fall of the American Empire with this Chinese
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.480]  Investment Bank and this trilateral acceleration and transferring the power
[27:54.480 --> 27:59.320]  to the UN and NATO that's why he became the first US president to head the
[27:59.320 --> 28:04.880]  Global Security Council which violates Article 1 Section 9 of the Constitution
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.800]  remember they had all these top globalists like Henry Kissinger at that
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.640]  event a few years ago when he became the head of the Security Council because it
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.680]  violates the law you can't have the president chair the most powerful
[28:20.680 --> 28:28.280]  position more powerful than the head of the UN more powerful than
[28:28.280 --> 28:34.280]  Boutros Boutros Ghali and and and Ban Ki-moon and you know all the other UN
[28:34.280 --> 28:40.760]  heads that we've seen as the Secretary-General's unprecedented so when
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.400]  we come back we've got that video of Dick Cheney says Obama wants to take
[28:46.400 --> 28:52.880]  America down that's actually true Dick Cheney for all the horrible things he
[28:52.880 --> 29:00.240]  did never tried to overthrow Egypt and put the Muslim Brotherhood in charge
[29:00.240 --> 29:12.560]  Dick Cheney didn't come after our guns Dick Cheney came after our borders he
[29:12.560 --> 29:15.880]  came after our sovereignty the North American Union I mean he followed the
[29:15.880 --> 29:20.480]  whole program that Obama's following but under Obama it is really accelerated
[29:20.480 --> 29:26.520]  and that's saying a lot that as bad as Bush and Cheney were now Cheney is
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.200]  saying Obama wants to take America down it's just so strange there's something
[29:30.200 --> 29:37.880]  truthful out of Dick Cheney's mouth so that's coming up as well and then we've
[29:37.880 --> 29:43.120]  got huge war news obviously this is huge out of AFP U.S. Aerospace Command

[33:36.080 --> 33:41.280]  don't want to be slaves folks like George Washington who is in our control
[33:41.280 --> 33:45.840]  room hanging on the banner in the center of things we can cut back over there for
[33:45.840 --> 33:51.320]  TV viewers and we are fighting the antithesis of people like George Washington
[33:51.320 --> 33:56.160]  and Thomas Jefferson when we discuss Obama who is becoming more and more a
[33:56.160 --> 34:01.480]  dictator in everything he does and then of course the powers that be one fat so
[34:01.480 --> 34:04.800]  the next puppet president they buy for several billion dollars whether they be
[34:04.800 --> 34:09.880]  Democrat or Republican we'll have the power to let the global bureaucracy
[34:09.880 --> 34:15.240]  and corporations loot this country at an even faster rate speaking of Dick
[34:15.240 --> 34:20.920]  Cheney coming out saying President Obama wants to take America down yeah Dick
[34:20.920 --> 34:25.240]  Cheney wanted to suck off of America and build a Pax Americana global empire
[34:25.240 --> 34:30.800]  based on America that's what the neocons want they wrote about it in Project for
[34:30.800 --> 34:35.600]  New American Century April of 2040 something page report written by Dick
[34:35.600 --> 34:44.920]  Cheney and Jeb Bush but when you look at Obama's world plan I used to disagree
[34:44.920 --> 34:51.820]  with the Nesta Suza and others that Obama was an anti-colonialist and so just
[34:51.820 --> 34:55.640]  hated America why would the globalist put him in power but he sees the middle
[34:55.640 --> 35:00.640]  class as colonialist he sees anybody Africans with a nice car or a house or a
[35:00.640 --> 35:07.120]  good good farm or or as doctors or progress as as as competition against
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.840]  them they see human activity and liberty and prosperity as a threat against
[35:11.840 --> 35:15.440]  their hegemonic takeover so there is a difference between the neocons and
[35:15.440 --> 35:21.500]  Obama even though Obama's cabinet's full of neocons the ideology of the
[35:21.500 --> 35:28.200]  anti-human left the eugenical left really is powering and driving things
[35:28.200 --> 35:34.120]  and animating things in this cultureless wasteland its globalism the
[35:34.120 --> 35:39.640]  the socialist leftist communist culture used to take over societies like a
[35:39.640 --> 35:46.880]  disease even threatens the establishment itself continuing here here's the big
[35:46.880 --> 35:54.160]  news again the Dick Cheney clip saying Obama wants to take America down if Mr.
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.320]  Vice President or does he have a far-reaching vision that only he
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.880]  entertains of a real line Middle East that somehow it all works out in the
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.960]  end I don't know you I've fast-laid between the various theories I've heard
[36:07.960 --> 36:13.040]  but you know if you had somebody as president who wanted to take America
[36:13.040 --> 36:16.840]  down who wanted to fundamentally weaken our position the world reduce our
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.920]  capacity influence events turn our back on our allies and and encourage your
[36:21.920 --> 36:27.400]  adversaries it would look exactly like what Barack Obama doing I think his
[36:27.400 --> 36:33.560]  actions are constituted in my mind those are the worst president we've ever
[36:33.560 --> 36:39.440]  had I really don't like that clip because it's it's it really freaks me out
[36:39.440 --> 36:45.440]  to hear Dick Cheney telling the truth and it just I have a real problem with
[36:45.440 --> 36:50.880]  it but it is the truth Barack Obama is the worst president this country has
[36:50.880 --> 36:54.000]  ever had
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.440]  Obamacare ending our sovereignty open borders coming out with the guns
[36:59.440 --> 37:06.280]  federalizing what our kids eat I mean what planet did I wake up on here and

[39:58.280 --> 40:04.920]  they're making their move now I want to get to the video give your radio
[40:04.920 --> 40:07.960]  listener all go through it play-by-play if you're a radio listener you can also

[40:23.600 --> 40:26.760]  people can use it that's just to pay for the bandwidth the cameras and the
[40:26.760 --> 40:32.640]  reporters and it does that so as it becomes self-sufficient we're moving
[40:32.640 --> 40:36.960]  towards a day when it will be free might not be a year might not be two years
[40:36.960 --> 40:42.600]  but that's where we're going as bandwidth prices lower we go from 1595
[40:42.600 --> 40:48.240]  membership one person can use to 20 but if you don't have a membership of 595 a
[40:48.240 --> 40:53.680]  month or a yearly membership it's like three months off that price you should
[40:53.680 --> 41:00.640]  go to prisonplanet.tv or infowarsnews.com and all you do is sign up and

[41:24.080 --> 41:27.600]  we got all these cable stations TV stations ready to launch it some have
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.560]  already started picking it up we're very close to that things like hernias and
[41:31.560 --> 41:35.320]  family issues and other operations were running you know getting away of that but
[41:35.320 --> 41:40.080]  but but this embryonic system is at the next launch level we're one of the

[43:58.760 --> 44:02.120]  with over a trillion dollars a year five hundred billion of it the North
[44:02.120 --> 44:07.000]  American market of narcotics alone and the same big families and companies

[54:12.720 --> 54:17.880]  the LA Times reported two years ago in the FBI released their unified crime
[54:17.880 --> 54:30.680]  statistics very quietly that crime using guns had dropped 52% since 1992 and of
[54:30.680 --> 54:35.000]  course school mass shootings had actually dropped some as well but it stayed
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.920]  relatively flat overall that's why it then came out two weeks ago that the
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.480]  FBI was put under pressure to try to cook those numbers and so those numbers
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.320]  are meant to make guns look bad and that gun crime actually dropped even more
[54:48.320 --> 54:56.160]  look it up for yourself headline gun crime drops but public thinks it's up
[54:56.160 --> 55:01.560]  LA Times that's just one example of many and so that said I'm not defending
[55:01.560 --> 55:07.120]  police in fact I'm trying to reform the police and you don't do that by running
[55:07.120 --> 55:12.160]  around saying kill the police like the George Soros funded groups that just
[55:12.160 --> 55:16.200]  want civil unrest in this country I'm not gonna play along with it you're gonna
[55:16.200 --> 55:19.720]  reform the police by explaining to them most of them already know this the
[55:19.720 --> 55:23.240]  globalist paradigm of giving them the training the culture that will make them
[55:23.240 --> 55:26.360]  enemies of the people giving them missions that will make them enemies the
[55:26.360 --> 55:31.440]  fake drug war going after folks for petty crimes like long grass in their yard
[55:31.440 --> 55:36.760]  but letting you know big bankers go free any legal aliens go free they don't
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.200]  like it either on average but then the bad cops get protected by the
[55:40.200 --> 55:45.320]  corruption and then that comes out in the media demonizing the police in
[55:45.320 --> 55:50.160]  general I've looked at the numbers actual police brutality and shootings are
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.680]  flat or down you got twice as much I mean pull these numbers up for listeners
[55:54.680 --> 55:59.760]  just type in more whites killed statistically than blacks by police and
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.880]  for every hundred whites more shot by cops than black statistically you
[56:04.880 --> 56:08.640]  wouldn't think that watching the media now some of them are justified some of
[56:08.640 --> 56:14.400]  them aren't we've had an Austin cop famously you know gags out of his car
[56:14.400 --> 56:17.960]  with a cell phone white guy no criminal record mental age cop shooting thinks
[56:17.960 --> 56:22.480]  it's a gun that person shouldn't be a cop they're so scared last time I heard I
[56:22.480 --> 56:25.560]  think they fired that cop the point I know they were firing him last time I
[56:25.560 --> 56:30.200]  heard I don't know that's official yet the point is is that the world's not
[56:30.200 --> 56:35.040]  perfect you're gonna have shootings you're gonna have crazy pilots crashing
[56:35.040 --> 56:41.400]  planes you're going to have bad cops and no amount of reform from the tops
[56:41.400 --> 56:45.040]  gonna fix it because the globalists don't want to fix anything that's what
[56:45.040 --> 56:49.640]  I'm getting at here South Carolina officer is charged with murder of
[56:49.640 --> 56:54.600]  Walter Scott the guy pulls over the Mercedes got a broken tail light shoots
[56:54.600 --> 57:00.480]  the guy in the back it's all on video from about 40 yards away that can roll
[57:00.480 --> 57:04.000]  the video in the background for radio listeners for TV viewers and then he
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.880]  drops a taser right beside him and then claims the guy trying to take his
[57:08.880 --> 57:14.040]  taser away that's premeditated cover up so you could say he did it out of fear
[57:14.040 --> 57:18.200]  or hysteria or whatever and get a manslaughter now it's got to be capital
[57:18.200 --> 57:22.480]  murder folks because then he sets him up and tries to cover and that looks
[57:22.480 --> 57:28.040]  cold-blooded now he shoots him in the back and then thinks oh my god what have
[57:28.040 --> 57:35.640]  I done we just don't need a bunch of psychopaths or cowards it's a mix as
[57:35.640 --> 57:39.640]  police I mean I'm sorry I mean you the guy runs away and you're too lazy to
[57:39.640 --> 57:42.960]  chase him you just shoot him in the back or you don't just call another squad car
[57:42.960 --> 57:49.240]  or helicopter this is crazy town and there are some people even defending this
[57:49.240 --> 57:54.760]  cop but he got caught trying to frame him and I tell you that's sick but the
[57:54.760 --> 58:02.720]  bigger problem is the revenuers like the home inspectors and the the agenda 21
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.240]  people and the so-called pet police that'll now grab your cat out of your
[58:06.240 --> 58:09.440]  backyard and charge you 500 bucks to get it back or they kill the cat there's an
[58:09.440 --> 58:16.120]  article in info wars.com on that and then even bigger is the DEA admittedly for
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.000]  50 plus years recording everything you do basically tracking everything you do
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.880]  and creating whole trees of who you call and who you associate with for their
[58:25.880 --> 58:29.440]  fake drug war that's sick so I'm against the drug war I'm against
[58:29.440 --> 58:32.520]  militarization of police but I'm not gonna play the game to complete their
[58:32.520 --> 58:36.560]  militarization and now have this civil war with the police we'll be right back
[58:36.560 --> 58:40.400]  but again big brother caught up with this cop didn't he didn't get away with
[58:40.400 --> 58:44.560]  this murder he'll probably get off of five ten years in prison he needs to be
[58:44.560 --> 58:50.080]  given the death penalty it's a pre-meditated murder and a setup in the
[58:50.080 --> 58:55.240]  near future when you realize how fake it all is the football the basketball
[58:55.240 --> 59:00.840]  security alert this is homeland security analysis info wars building
[59:00.840 --> 59:04.920]  independent media operation but the worst people get controlled and tell us
[59:04.920 --> 59:10.560]  that we are the ones responsible prime director discredit Alex Jones Jones is
[59:10.560 --> 59:14.880]  the wildly popular conspiracy theory popular conspiracy theory talk show
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.800]  called info wars Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail these people are assaulting
[59:19.800 --> 59:25.400]  targeting of patriots engaged they are never going to stop they're never going
[59:25.400 --> 59:31.040]  to deviate from their program until we stop them block free iphone at info
[59:31.040 --> 59:40.240]  wars.com block free podcast and video feed imperative you gotta set your eye on the
[59:40.240 --> 59:43.280]  enemy not worry about what propaganda they put out
[59:43.280 --> 59:47.440]  intellectually it's for God you can fail it
[59:47.440 --> 01:00:08.320]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:15.920]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:24.760]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones bad boys bad boys what you
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.560]  gonna do what you gonna do with the cameras come for you yeah he's been
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.760]  indicted for murder South Carolina officers charged with murder of Walter
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.120]  Scott and the usual suspects are running around attacking the police in
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.440]  general that's like saying as a black guy kills a white person all blacks are
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.520]  to blame or because the clan kills some black person all whites are to blame
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.520]  again it's more divided conquer which will put the police in their own gang
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.680]  mentality the public in their own gang mentality that's where the globalists
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.800]  want us in their divide in Congress strategy but I tell you if the cop
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.440]  wouldn't have tried to plant the taser on him he could have said I feared for my
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.560]  life adrenaline got away from me I thought they were turning back I thought he
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:12.120]  had a gun in his hand but no then he would just got kicked off the force now
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:18.960]  he is gonna get prison time better get prison time and I'm sorry you know if
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.440]  you shot a cop in the back like this you'd get the death penalty and I just
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.520]  think there'll be respect for the police again when there's fairness again but I
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.840]  sure don't want my son or my father shot in the back
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.000]  guys I forget the statistics came out from the feds when you pull up that
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.280]  article from about three months ago it had the headline whites in Hispanics
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.640]  were likely to be shot by police and blacks because I want to show people
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.520]  those numbers not just quote them from memory because that's the fundamental
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.560]  issue here is and we should come in with John Bowne's piece I said I'd get into
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.920]  his Phoenix report we'll do that in the next segment I got behind we should do
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:02.080]  that John Bowne intro that he did a few years ago when they came out with the
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:09.680]  it's one it's one of the Motley crew music yeah the live wire paralleling
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.480]  death rates 2000 with David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone an excellent B
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:24.240]  movie on a dystopic future and in it you get bonuses for wiping out men women and
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.320]  children and the elderly and then you have these no compromise targets that
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.400]  Homeland Security bought two million dollars worth of and the company said
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.800]  look Homeland Security asked for it women and children you know little kids
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:43.360]  people in the shower no hesitation targets and yeah in Vietnam they started
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.000]  having these basically video games for the troops to instinctively shoot and
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.360]  it made people go from 50% of the time pulling the trigger up close to about a
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:57.000]  hundred percent or 95% now with instinctive shooting training and I've
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.120]  done it back when I spent the guns big before we had a radio show I used to go
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.840]  out and those police shooting contest that quotes civilians to be part of and
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.840]  if you wanted to win you just don't think when the targets pop up you shoot the
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.400]  bad guys you go through the obstacle course and I used to get in the top
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.360]  10 20 percentile you know I only did it six or seven times the cops used to get
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.160]  so mad I'm like an 18 year old was beating them but I had better reflexes
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.760]  obviously now I'd be terrible at it compared when I was 18 but that's why
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.240]  soldiers are better when they're young because it's your your reflexes are so
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.480]  fast and you're stupid and aren't don't think you can die which also helps but
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.960]  it's easy to second-guess the police because they're gonna make a lot of
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:45.080]  mistakes but you start giving them instinctive shooting reflex shooting
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:50.440]  training I mean somebody gets out of their car with a cell phone or wallet
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.440]  boom I mean they're shooting old ladies are shooting black people they're
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.720]  shooting Hispanics they're the black cops are shooting white people whites are
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.120]  shooting blacks blacks are shooting blacks you've seen the footage comes all
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:08.280]  the time of black cops shooting black guy and you know you'll see some guy run
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.640]  or start wrestling in LA and the black cop shoots them and that's not a big
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:19.200]  issue because it's a black guy I mean it's a it's a it's a very serious
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:25.360]  situation out there to say the least but where it becomes somebody being
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:31.640]  hysterical or having buck fever and again that's what it's called when you go
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.800]  hunting and shoot a cow because you say it looked like a deer they're people you
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.400]  take hunting for the first time they could be a executive they could be a
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.400]  lawyer they could be really smart going to person you put them out on your stand
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.600]  the Sun comes up and 500 yards away on somebody else's property they shoot a
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.960]  cow because it had horns they thought they were antlers and it's the same thing
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.640]  with a lot of these cops they're just ready to kill somebody not even because
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.480]  they're psychopaths but because they're trained to pull that gun and pull that

[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.640]  7 o'clock central info wars nightly news here's what I want to do ahead of a
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:39.400]  special guest joining us in the third hour today Jerry Peterman who heads up
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.120]  Fukushima update report.com interviews the scientists the folks on the ground
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.120]  the people at the universities doing the testing we're going to be looking at
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:55.000]  mainstream news coming out Fukushima radiation has reached North American
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.120]  shores Woods Hole oceanographic institution says well it's been
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:05.240]  reaching here but now the actual sea debris is slamming in and what we're
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.080]  going to do is review the fact that this is a whitewash in fact you guys
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.320]  reprint me the stuff from two years ago about the tuna off San Diego with three
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:19.960]  times the safe level of cesium in it and stuff like that the milk in Vermont with
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.120]  the cesium and other isotope said it because I want to really show you the
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.600]  anatomy of a whitewash and I'm not trying to scare folks the Northern
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.480]  Hemisphere had double the radiation from nuclear testing and from Chernobyl in
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.640]  86 it's now basically triple and we have those readings as well from the federal
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:46.600]  government and from Europe so what changed why don't they care anymore
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:56.800]  simply amazing Democrats as IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns that
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:02.400]  ties into some huge illegal DEA news and it ties into South Carolina officers
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.560]  charged with murder of Walter Scott shoots the person in the back for no
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:11.520]  reason plants a taser on him and claims that he tried to take the taser away
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:22.960]  premeditated frame up super evil super corrupt and he got caught if somebody
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:30.560]  was videotaping it we'll also get into that article I mentioned with the
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:39.520]  statistics on cops are more likely to shoot whites or others over blacks two
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.880]  to one study shows just to shatter this myth that the cops are out there
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:50.840]  hunting black people no the cops aren't responding in inner-city black areas
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.760]  because they don't want to be set up and they don't want to lose their jobs
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.600]  that's really the tragedy here black cops in south side Chicago or have some
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.640]  of the slowest response times out there because they don't want to be in the
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:10.120]  middle of it so those are the facts we're going to get to it huge news with
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.960]  Dick Cheney coming out we played the clip earlier the clips on info wars calm
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:22.800]  says president Obama wants to take America down and sure I would say Dick
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.320]  Cheney was taking the Bill of Rights and Constitution down and was terrible
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:33.680]  and Obama used many of his power grabs the power grab as well but it is true
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:39.240]  that Obama whether it's devaluing the dollar or whether it's not blocking the
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.680]  Chinese investment bank or whether it is shelling us out to al-qaeda or whether
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.520]  it's attacking and shutting down our power plants I mean George Bush didn't do
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.160]  that carbon taxes you name it if I wanted to shut America down and annihilate
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:02.520]  the working class the middle class this is exactly what I do so we're going to
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:08.080]  be going over all of that coming up but first off to understand where military
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:16.600]  drills like Jade Helm be conducted in August and September if you want to
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.240]  understand where stuff like that comes from and why we're concerned it's
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.240]  because they'll have a lot of legitimate decontamination drills dirty bomb
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.600]  drills which they're now announcing for the public consumption but the night
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.160]  time drills the practice taking over courthouses and police stations and
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.440]  capitals and things like that is in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.600]  of 2007 to crush the states and legislatures or governors that are in
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:48.960]  rebellion it says that so it is a link and ask move to block the states if they
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.680]  try to block a treasonous federal takeover and the federal government
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.280]  itself has been seized by the globalist and if you understand Delta Force and
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.520]  the Navy SEALs and all these snatch and grab door kicking operations where
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.480]  they're number one enemy domestically they're told in the public documents
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.000]  this isn't even secret now there's no denying it veterans gun owners
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.080]  libertarians conservatives pro livers they've now added evangelicals I mean
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:20.200]  evangelicals are really nice people and I was brought up quasi evangelical I
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.560]  went to some evangelical churches amongst Southern Baptists and Methodist
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:31.120]  stuff like that we went to a lot of different churches but that's about as
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.000]  government worshiping as you're gonna get going along with the system as
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.240]  evangelicals they think the end of the world's any minutes that just go along
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:44.160]  with but that shows how they hate the faith itself and the love of Jesus Christ
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.560]  because any deity can be above the government and above the state and if
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.080]  your rights come from God they can't come from Kim Jong-un who the North
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:59.400]  Koreans pray for their lunches for and in Venezuela I didn't believe it five
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.960]  years ago when a Venezuelan programmer I know told me and I believed him but I
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.120]  couldn't believe it then it came out mainstream news that on TV they have
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.720]  morning prayers on their equivalent of Sesame Street they got a puppet show
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:18.240]  this was in mainstream news where they pray to the current president and to the
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.400]  dead saint is now he's dead back then they would pray to Chavez to get their
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.880]  milk Max Cabrera did a lot of programming workforce and his parents
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.360]  had a big private school there till the government took it over he talked about
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.000]  his dad just you know refused and then he was worried about persecution he
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.960]  wanted me to say his name but later he said I could and I mean they told him
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.560]  his dad and his dad said I am not gonna have the kids pray to Chavez and then
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.600]  they would have him pray to Christ and then they wouldn't get the milk and
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:56.360]  cereal these are hungry kids and then they would pray to Chavez and get the
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.640]  milk and the rice Krispy's basically I mean this is brainwashing people I'm not
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:17.560]  gonna worship some commie let's go to this clip good evening my fellow
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.280]  Americans over the past several weeks you have heard a number of reports on
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:28.040]  TV radio and in your newspapers on the situation in Southeast Asia I think the
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.720]  time has come for me as president and as commander-in-chief of our armed forces
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:37.960]  to put these reports in perspective tactics used during the Vietnam War by
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.720]  the CIA and military eerily echo the current establishment's buildup of
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.480]  Stasi style homeland security and that their declaration that the greatest
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.680]  threat to national security is sovereign patriotic citizens not the
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.720]  thousands of criminals crossing our southern border murdering and raping
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.520]  American citizens not the Islamic terrorist organizations that have been
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.120]  embedded in the United States for decades among those variety of reasons
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:06.240]  radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals took the
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.200]  steps that they did we see say radical Islam I mean I think those people who
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:15.280]  espouse a version of Islam that is not you are you uncomfortable attributing
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.560]  any of their actions to radical Islam it sounds like I don't want to say anything
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.200]  negative about a religion that is no no I'm not talking about a man like a lot
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.040]  about radical Islam I'm not talking about the general religion no real
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:32.240]  constitution loving apple pie eating Americans are the number one threat to
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:37.680]  their own country and 2 plus 2 equals 5 how and why is that declaration even
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:44.280]  rational Vietnam 1965 to 1972 the Phoenix program a CIA designed and
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.600]  coordinated infiltration of the political infrastructure of the national
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:53.400]  liberation front of South Vietnam aka the Vietcong communist army force must
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:01.200]  often precede reason and the waste of war the works of peace the CIA had been
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.240]  covertly infiltrating Vietcong strongholds to seek out names on their
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.680]  kill list one of the tactics included parading innocent Vietnamese citizens
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.000]  around their village with a bag over their head and a leash around their
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.960]  neck terrorizing all of the residents the Vietnamese citizen on the leash would
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.040]  then be instructed to indicate which house the Vietcong informer might live
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.920]  the next day the CIA's provincial reconnaissance units would kick the
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:32.120]  door down and kill everyone inside women and children included the CIA's PRU
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.920]  would haul the Vietcong off to regional interrogation centers where they would
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.640]  be tortured to extract information for the commanding officers and then the
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:44.960]  whole process would be repeated the Phoenix program neutralized 81,740
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.880]  Vietcong operatives killing between 26,000 and 41,000 of them Peter De Silva
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.200]  the CIA station chief developed the strategy known as counter-terror the
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.280]  use of terrorism as a legitimate tool to use an unconventional warfare De Silva
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.200]  strategically applied the counter-terror to unsuspecting quote enemy
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.640]  civilians unquote historian Douglas Valentine noted in his important work
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:13.200]  the Phoenix program that central to Phoenix is the fact that it targeted
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.640]  civilians not soldiers innocent victims of Castro's rounding up a 200,000
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.960]  citizens during the CIA's Bay of Pigs invasion can't help but see the
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:26.120]  implications of similar operations inside the United States after witnessing
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.560]  troops training to intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale Florida the upcoming
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:35.640]  Jade Helm operation from July through September of 2015 states that troops
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.920]  will operate undetected amongst civilian populations to see if they can
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.880]  infiltrate without being noticed with martial law plans that have been in
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.400]  place for decades the globalist bankers that control our government see the CIA's
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.200]  approach in Vietnam as a benchmark in undermining US sovereignty in just 14
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.160]  years since 9-11 unleashing a degradation in the American Bill of
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:05.960]  Rights never before seen in our 239 year history the fall of Saigon in 1975 marked
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.480]  the end of the Vietnam War communism won and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:17.600]  was born the CIA lost the Vietnam War by targeting the citizenry with the Jade
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:22.640]  Helm operations gearing up for the summer of 2015 trees and seed at the

[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.080]  deal they didn't really lose Vietnam they wouldn't let them bomb the north they
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.480]  wouldn't let them take out the harbors they wouldn't let them mine them it was
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.280]  about making money and destabilizing things and if the globalist can start a
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.520]  civil war here and lose it they don't care because they'll make trillions off
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.320]  of the war so if the globalist couldn't take Vietnam they sure can't take over

[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.080]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show I'm Alex Jones coming to you from deep in
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:26.240]  the heart of Texas Austin from the info wars.com news center
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.960]  you see if you just flip or not even flip shift your view to a globalist
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:36.600]  perspective doesn't mean you agree with what they're doing but if you get into
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:41.320]  their mindset then their logic their wicked logic makes perfect sense and
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:48.200]  does have an arithmetic that balances out in a very nasty way people say why
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.320]  aren't we allowed to win Vietnam why for ten years couldn't we bomb the north or
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:58.560]  attack the harbor or mine it because they were making hundreds of billions of
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.840]  dollars a year that's equivalent of trillions and trillions a year on the
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.760]  Vietnam War they were using the dialectic to grow the leftist movement as
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.960]  the opposition with Time Magazine and Newsweek and Life promoting Hillary
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.320]  Clinton and John Kerry as saviors as the new political class they wanted to
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:24.280]  control revolution in the country so they created a war to discredit America
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:28.000]  that's why we do business with Vietnam now and they're not a communist state
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.880]  basically they're communist in name only now the Vietnamese are having a war
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:39.160]  with the Chinese oh yeah for a year they got a war going they're not calling it a
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:48.320]  war but it's a war on the ocean and on the land they border China and so we
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:54.520]  fed 58,000 Americans 200 plus thousand wounded millions of dead Vietnamese when
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.880]  Ho Chi Minh wanted to work with the US and wanted to kick the communist out and
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.160]  then we wouldn't work with him because he wouldn't let the French run all the
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.320]  smack out of the country he wanted to develop an economy based on industry and
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:14.480]  they said nobody we're gonna ship heroin out of your country and he said no
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:20.760]  you're not it's all on record so they said watch this we're gonna squat on the
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:26.440]  south and ship it out and keep you from shipping it out and we're gonna make
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.980]  money on the weapons at the same time and we're gonna fill the caskets
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:40.400]  declassified full of heroin and then we're gonna make movies blaming one
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:45.320]  black guy for it and Denzel Washington will star in it
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:55.400]  that's what all of this is really all about boys and girls I want to open the
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:03.720]  phones up in the next segment on the huge military developments on the
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:09.160]  situation when Fukushima on this house bill bans fake guns not real guns near
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:15.120]  schools see there's no lobby to protect nerf guns so they can ban that then ban
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.760]  the real thing first you ban the words you ban the image then you ban the real
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:25.800]  thing that's what political correctness is all about that's out of the Tennessee
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.320]  and and then that ties in to this article I mentioned earlier but I want to
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:36.280]  get to now Democrats IRS can pay gun owners to turn in their guns this is
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.080]  the new model of where we'll forgive your tax debts just turn your guns in a
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.920]  Democrat lawmaker is going to introduce a bill next week designed to relieve
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.360]  Americans of burdensome taxes and exchange for their boom-booms this out
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.160]  of this pack review a Democrat lawmakers gonna introduce a bill next week
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.160]  designed to relieve Americans of burdensome taxes to change for their
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:00.280]  guns representative Rosa del Loro of Connecticut the Democrat is introducing
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.960]  the bill the support assault farms elimination and education I thought you
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.280]  didn't want to be on the guns oh you want to eliminate them though an education
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.000]  of our streets act and will offer tax credits of 2,000 for those who choose to
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.520]  turn in their weapons all of them the local police how's that sound you're
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.960]  just going to keep raising taxes until you got to turn your guns in here go
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.400]  bankrupt but don't worry if you're a big global bank your tax exempt or if you're
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:29.120]  illegal aliens almost use that word sorry you said so you don't have to pay
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.960]  the taxes I mean it's just it's just a monumental takeover and that's the
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.240]  power to tax is the power to destroy as George Washington said the power to
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:43.200]  tax is the power to destroy if McDonald's and 2000 plus companies get a
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:49.240]  waiver four years ago on Obamacare they don't have to get it but your hamburger
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.560]  shop that doesn't have GMO that isn't full of crud you actually pay your
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.360]  employees decent your burgers taste a lot better but they cost more because
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:04.120]  they're not cardboard and then you got to get everybody insurance what happens
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.960]  your burger is $10 McDonald's is $2
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:17.520]  the power to tax is the power to destroy and then you raise taxes and
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.560]  regulations so high poor people can't afford the $10 hamburger because beef
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:30.080]  prices have doubled they got to eat some franken crud made out of silly putty or
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.680]  whatever from Mickey D's the circle is now complete bondage through economic
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:42.400]  warfare siege and now the great enemy is any farm any ranch any independent

[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:15.520]  office of the trilateral commission trilateral commission yeah the
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:22.960]  trilateral commission all right what is the trilateral commission
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:28.520]  the Toronto Commission is a private organization founded by David Rockefeller
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:33.800]  in 1973 but you see what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:40.400]  loyal members in positions of power in this country to work to erase national
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:45.440]  boundaries and create an international community and in time bring about
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:56.760]  a one-world government the David Rockefeller calling the shots we're not
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:00.920]  your slaves we're not your slaves you started help start the trilateral
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.880]  commission and you've been to the building board of groups there is such a
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:09.200]  thing as insidious influence I'm telling you our whole way of life as we know it
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.000]  is in jeopardy I appreciate that I have I have the documented evidence it's all
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.200]  in there show it it's most notable members include George Bush it is a big
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.720]  idea a new world order are you happy for the millions of deaths you're part of
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:28.960]  people know people are waking up to the reality of this mr. Bush the chainie I
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.680]  think that what needed to be done was done I think we were perfectly justified
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.480]  in doing it
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:53.600]  I think this is a very hard choice we think the price is worth it that you
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.120]  remember at the at the convention everybody thought it was gonna be Ford
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:02.080]  for beef you know what happened David Rockefeller just picked up a phone for
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:08.520]  to Nicole hey Ronnie forget Jerry it's George bye no matter who won in
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:12.400]  November they had their man in the White House David Rockefeller founded all
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:16.320]  the major UN groups their family gave the you in the land I mean this is the
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.920]  global Empire New World Order is the headline in the global mail and he's
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:24.680]  this global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge we
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.200]  are grateful the Washington Post the New York Times Time Magazine other great
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.360]  publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.480]  promise of discretion for almost 40 years it would have been impossible for us
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.480]  to develop our plan for the world if we would have been subject to the bright
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.560]  lights of publicity during those years but the work is now much more
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.200]  sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government defending
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:52.120]  the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones broadcasting
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:58.800]  worldwide if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:05.600]  well they were back on mainstream television in the early 1980s making
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.280]  fun of people talking about the trilateral Commission and everything
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:17.000]  they said in that Barney Miller piece is absolutely true but then all the newsmen
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.440]  in the TV show get to laugh at it hey you know the trilateral Commission has a
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.440]  plan to create three global groups transfer sovereignty to them and then
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.880]  set up tyrannies where they're gonna micromanage every facet of our lives
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:35.760]  and raise taxes so high we all go bankrupt haha no no here they wrote
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.160]  books saying it they're doing it haha it's so funny now they go yeah there's a
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:46.480]  global government yeah it's unelected and the veterans and patriots are
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.720]  terrorists and they're gonna blow stuff up no you're going to blow stuff up and
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.480]  blanch I watched episode seven of the first season of House of Cards again I
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.680]  don't watch television I should watch more entertainment because that's what
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:03.800]  the real propaganda is who are the discredited mainstream news they're
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.080]  in free fall and episode was a seven or eight I watched two last night it's very
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.080]  well done House of Cards obviously it's only I'm telling you something you don't
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:22.600]  know and it's all transparent though somebody throws a brick through the
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:27.240]  congressman's window and it was so obvious that he diverted the cop so he
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.840]  could do it and then they are gonna blame the cop for not stopping it and at
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.200]  the end he tells his opposition yeah I did it to trick the opposition and to
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:40.080]  get mad and punch him in the face so he can threaten him with a felony for
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:43.920]  attacking a congressman if he doesn't go along with him and then he's the good
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:50.080]  guy everybody watches it goes oh Underwood is so evil he's so smart and
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:55.400]  marvels at it and then the real propaganda his wife runs global water
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:01.200]  initiatives because she cares about people but she's also a crook and it's
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:08.720]  so proud of the fact he cheats on her and they're going to get some jobs going
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.520]  after shutting down 12,000 jobs they're gonna get 3,000 jobs in Pennsylvania by
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.360]  running their corrupt congressman who's on cocaine who they control and who's
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:22.440]  compromised and who sells out people and he thinks they're helping folks in one
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.240]  out of a 10,000 might know the scam she shows the watershed and says and will
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:31.280]  develop it environmentally sensitive so they're the heroes when that's a real
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.240]  agenda I live under in Austin that's a global model to take everybody's
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:39.000]  private property not let you use it force you to sell it then they turn
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.800]  around and build on it and then double triple charge you for water I mean I cut
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.940]  my teeth fighting these people I've been to their conferences where they set up
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:54.280]  there and rub their hands together and admit it's a criminal operation remember
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.280]  like 16 17 years ago with my hands we got to find those videos they aired on
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:01.560]  access TV on the radio and I'd walk up to all these mayors and governors people
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.360]  meeting here at the smart growth conference interviewed Michael Dell you
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:08.080]  name it and I walk over and I go you mean you're just taking private property
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.320]  and developing it and building it and taking it and this former Dallas cowboy
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:15.120]  I forget his name he's famous he's a white guy he just goes get out of my way for
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.400]  us he goes of course what sort of laughing at me going it's about money
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:25.240]  really tell me something I don't know get out of my way and he and they were
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:30.120]  just stomping around and I'd go but this isn't nice and they would just go I got
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:38.320]  a bunch of it on tape they're just like really it's a scam I mean they made the
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.960]  house of Cards guy look like an angel cake you think that guy's manipulative
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:52.920]  in that show you ain't seen nothing and I just can't believe they have shows where
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:40:01.000]  they glorify this type of garbage and I was watching the flying back from LA
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:08.560]  Chicago PD and about a special crimes unit where they torture people and sure
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:11.160]  enough I went look at the synopsis of other episodes every episode it's
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.000]  torturing people and it's always for the good that they torture people and that
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.480]  they cover up evidence and they do whatever they want because they're the
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:21.560]  good guys I mean this is pure brainwashing where they set up these
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.240]  situational ethics where it's good that they do it but the real world it's not
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.680]  good they do it and then when a cop sets somebody up you go to prison so people
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:35.560]  are taught by television I wasn't taught by television I was taught by the real
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:40.080]  world and by business and by life and by the streets and by being involved and
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:47.680]  by acting like a man when I was 14 years old and I just thought I was normal at
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:51.960]  14 that I wanted to date college girls I thought I was normal when I was 14
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:55.960]  fighting 18 year olds I thought it was normal that I wanted a 500 horsepower
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:59.040]  car I thought it was normal that I didn't like to cops deal on drugs in my
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.560]  neighborhood and then run in checkpoints looking for drugs and I'd get in their
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.120]  face they'd flip out and take me to jail and threaten to kill me I thought it was
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:09.240]  normal to want to support the Second Amendment when I learned they were
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:12.780]  coming after the Second Amendment when I was 18 I said you know I'm gonna stop
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:16.160]  drinking and stop fighting and get my life straight and start exercising got
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.640]  an incredible shape got my life together for about five years kind of went back
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.960]  to being bad a little bit drinking and smoking after that got depressed about
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.440]  the New World Order turned into job of the hut now I've reversed about 60 70
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:33.120]  percent of that horrible transformation but the point is is that the public are
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.160]  so childlike and so naive and that's why they don't want you playing
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.080]  competitive sports it's why they don't want you playing dodgeball or jogging or
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.760]  wrestling or shaking hands or anything because in the nanny state they want you
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.440]  cowardly and not developed and you've got men and women who are in arrested
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:54.200]  development especially men where they freeze men at the age of children I
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:59.400]  mean everywhere I go I hear men talking about football and basketball and what
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.980]  happened with Duke and Wisconsin and and they'll say to me even listers hey
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:08.760]  Alex which think about that basketball game and I'll go you know I used to like
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.240]  that but those are kind of the things of a child you know they designed that
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:17.520]  because your mind's meant for warfare and business and a war game things you're
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.960]  supposed to be really aggressive and dominant as a male and building a better
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:25.400]  world and standing up against the other aggressive males that are weaker but
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:28.560]  they'll use cheating to get ahead we're supposed to defeat them and stand up for
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:32.160]  our women and children and they'll go whoa whoa dude I go wait you know who I
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.600]  am you just said hey Alex what do you think of the game I don't know you and
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.320]  you just stopped me on the street asking me about a game is that the set me
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:45.680]  yesterday I go is that some kind of joke because buddy I'm dealing with Fukushima
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:49.960]  I'm dealing with cancer viruses and the vaccines I'm dealing with chemical weapon
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.480]  attacks on the public and it's not cuz I'm some hero this is a normal response in
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:59.520]  fact my forebears would have already organized at the legislative level and
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.720]  they would already have a physical war going on right now okay that was because
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:08.680]  they were businessmen merchants but also been in the average male by the age of
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:15.760]  35 in 1776 had been in three guerrilla wars that's other reason the British
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.400]  were in big trouble oh they thought some of their soldiers have maybe been in one
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.120]  war that's such a high turnover rate we're about to figure out that in three
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:30.480]  wars in the space of 15 years so I mean I'm nobody I mean our forebears would be
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:36.360]  running around killing people right now okay they wouldn't be usurped they
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:40.040]  wouldn't be enslaved they wouldn't be run over by a bunch of slick talking
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:45.960]  underwoods they'd strangle them and not because they weren't as manipulative as
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.720]  underwood but because they were honorable and they were men who could do
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:55.080]  things out in the open and who had people follow them because they were
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:02.720]  strong and virtuous not piles of manipulative lying crap
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:09.640]  excuse me I'm gonna go to your phone calls the toll-free number to join us

[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.680]  restaurants at swimming pools at the gym at church and everywhere they just
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:34.160]  want to talk to me about stuff on record with the Olympic Committee 1914 and this
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:38.360]  French Prince that developed it with the Germans to manipulate the public and
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:42.480]  not being involved in real issues I mean I know I've read the books written by
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.680]  Edward Bernays I've read the papers written by the founder of the Olympic
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.760]  Committee I have read the statements by Hitler on sports I know it's to
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:56.040]  manipulate men where men sit around in fantasy football I mean you might as
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:02.200]  well gain the stock market you might as well have fun but it's just these aren't
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:08.240]  men these aren't men these are the top of men who will go work their arms out
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.360]  all day so I think they're big who will just do the symbol of being manly and
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:15.080]  we'll say something smart to you or try to intimidate you and the minute you

[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.120]  fake image of one you don't build anything you're not even alive your
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.320]  women and children don't belong to you they belong to the globalist who
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:44.760]  conquered you I don't want to be conquered I don't want to have my destiny
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.720]  controlled I don't want my children brainwashed I don't want to be a slave
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:57.440]  and that humanity is done and we're being phased out no so do not ask me
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:04.360]  about football or baseball I was I hadn't seen Charlie Sheen in about a year I
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:07.400]  wanted to go check in on him he's doing pretty good trying to do yoga and
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.040]  exercise and stuff I knew Charlie back when he was you know straight my party
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:16.200]  at all 12 years ago he's a great guy overall at least he's a real person and
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.680]  here he had Babe Ruth's World Series ring Babe Ruth's Yankee contract all
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:27.160]  this incredible stuff and it was really neat and interesting but I thought it
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.680]  was more interesting even though he has a lot of problems that he had the courage
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:36.040]  to come out for 9-11 truth that's a lot more exciting to me than the fact that
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:40.200]  he has a room full of Babe Ruth memorabilia that you won't see at the
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.200]  World Baseball Hall of Fame that's been supposed to talk about that he didn't
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:50.920]  tell me not to the point is is that I don't care even though Babe Ruth was a
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:56.440]  really cool guy a man's man compared to these men nowadays you could admire
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:03.240]  Babe Ruth because he was real ladies only wasn't a fake but that's because he
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:11.600]  grew up in a rough saloon with a brothel on top of it and even though you can
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.960]  point your finger and say Babe Ruth was a immoral guy like women I like to fight
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.960]  will give me a break that's a lot better than selling out to this system and
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.280]  selling out to this fake culture and just being total jellyfish I'll take
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.680]  somebody real any day of the week over one of these fakes and I'm ranting I
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.800]  want to go to Francis and Steve and Charlie when we come back from break we
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.120]  got a big Fukushima update coming but that's only 30 minutes long then we'll
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:42.160]  continue with phone calls I didn't mean to get mad I apologize for that coming
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:46.480]  up after that NASA will find alien life in 10 to 20 years and we already found
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.480]  the globalist a bunch of psychopaths they're not human in my view L.A.

[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:21.600]  of the Dukes of hazard which I was not really a fan of so stupid but I was a
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:28.120]  little kid when I was on the first aired is the intro song by Whelan Jennings just

[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:48.840]  air Steven hello hey brother go ahead I'm calling in about House of Cards I heard
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:53.800]  you talking about it earlier sounded like from what you're saying that you're
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:58.800]  you're watching season one yes I haven't watched a season two or three yet but
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:03.640]  it's all programming for economic takeover kicking old people off social
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.640]  security euthanizing folks it's all globalist propaganda from what I've
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:13.960]  seen voice in seven episodes does it change as it progresses well I agree
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.840]  with you that it's it's very intriguing to watch they do a very good job of
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:22.480]  presenting all that yeah I wanted to bring up in season three I just it just
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.760]  came out this year and I was watching it I finished already there's a crazy scene
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:32.080]  where Francis goes into a church with his bodyguards and he literally walks up
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:37.040]  to a statue of Christ and he spits in the face of Christ and a moment later the
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:40.280]  statue falls to the ground and shatters into a million pieces it's a
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:45.040]  brilliant shocking scene so they're basically saying he is the anti-Christ
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:51.160]  and it's it's it's pretty sick what episode is that I somewhere in the
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.000]  middle of season three I can't recall exactly which one it is right now well
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.440]  they're selling being evil as cool and then the end it's for the greater good

[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.000]  every once in a while computerized phone systems have hiccups so the phone
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.800]  systems down except for Charlie J and Francis that got through and there's
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:42.960]  some audio issues there but we'll go to folks regardless I think we're gonna turn
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:46.040]  the system off at the break and reboot it so we can take calls the bottom of the
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:51.440]  hour but Charlie in California you were talking about there's not a lot of news
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:55.160]  portals that really get it and I think there's a lot of folks out there that
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.320]  are concerned and somewhat awake they just don't get how bad it really is
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:02.880]  like Germans didn't believe that Hitler was really killing all those people
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.240]  because it was hidden and folks didn't believe that the Germans actually didn't
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:09.880]  know but most of them didn't and I think it's the same thing that we've seen
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:14.960]  throughout history is that people are in denial because they can't imagine that
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:19.520]  things could really be that bad but we know because of alternative media and
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:23.160]  even what's been admitted that this plan is happening where do you see all this
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.560]  going because what you first said really let a fire under me you're right
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:32.440]  it's epic to be able to fight this it's it's it's an incredible time it's so
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:38.720]  exciting I mean I'm not happy about it but it's exciting when you really study
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.480]  all this how epic it is and how huge it is and how important it is go go ahead
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:49.360]  Charlie you've got the floor yes you're absolutely right Alex and it's just so
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:54.920]  what makes it more exciting to be on God's team you know everything to go
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:01.120]  over is tell us it's okay to do God's that don't do and you know how can they
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:06.360]  tell you come out when he did his part to help bring America down and that 9-11
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:13.560]  fiasco I mean it is terrible how they play on us and tell us you know that this
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:18.120]  anything they come out and say Obama is just another stage of what Bush and
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:22.760]  Cheney was doing helping to bring our country down there to me so much to see
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:27.200]  the little children out there who hoping for a future man and they're gonna have
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.800]  no future if they slow us get their way I just tell you but I'll tell you this
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:36.400]  Alex and it's a blessing man to be able to talk to you this morning God is with
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:41.320]  the righteous man and dog on it the globalist on rules there's no way they
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:46.280]  can win and I'm thank you brother football you're doing and I just just great
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:50.880]  to be part of it man well God bless you too sir we're all brothers and sisters
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.480]  together in spirit and that's the great unity of loving liberty and freedom and
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:00.120]  God versus the devil and his systems that's why they want to divide us because
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:04.680]  our souls our hearts are just the same we are together we are brothers God
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:08.400]  bless you my brother absolutely that's why the enemy wants to divide us because
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:11.600]  they know in our heart is our conscience and what brings us together
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.120]  we're all children of God the only question is you know do we end up
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:19.800]  splitting off and making the devil our father and I see the atheists on the
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.640]  website and once quit talking about God even if you don't believe in God the
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:29.800]  archetype of good versus evil God versus the devil creation versus destruction
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:37.120]  life versus death pre-market versus conquest there it's real we manifest
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:46.520]  it and it goes beyond that but yeah I mean that's what frustrates me Cheney
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:49.960]  tells the truth that says Obama's bringing America down and as the caller
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.040]  just said as Charles just said it's just an extension of the same agenda and
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:58.840]  that's how they make themselves look good is that they can criticize the
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:01.780]  globalist agenda when they're not in power and act like they're not part of
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:06.360]  it so they get right back in power the right foot takes a step then the left
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:09.960]  acts like they're against it they take a step let's quit looking at the legs
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:14.000]  let's look at the body and the head and the brain and the arms of the globalist
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.320]  operation and that's the big central banks that's a handful of families that

[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:17.000]  Lexington heard round the world when the British fired in the early dawn the
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:24.040]  war of independence had begun the die was cast the rebel flag unfurled and on
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:29.040]  to Concord march the fold to seize the arsenal there you know waiting folks
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:35.400]  searching all around tell our militia stop them in their tracks at the old

[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:47.520]  and the shot around the world was a start for the revolution the men men were
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:53.080]  ready on the move take your powder take your gun
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:09:00.480]  General Washington hurry in there's not an hour to lose happened that they had
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:04.960]  planned if the British was ever to come over here that they put a light up in
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.800]  this high church steeple and Paul went down there to look and showing up there
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:16.480]  was the light burning brighter than a Paul he jumped on his old horse and he
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:20.680]  lit out he didn't know where he's going but he knew he had to go somewhere oh I
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.160]  wish you could have seen it that old horse with his ears laid back in his
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.520]  nostrils wide open a sucking in wind like a jet engine feet pounding on them
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.720]  cobblestones striking off sparks Paul are holding on for dear life and are
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:36.760]  hollering at the top of his lungs he says the British is coming the British is
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:41.960]  coming get you a gun we gonna have us a revolution and them farmers come up
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.800]  piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive minute men there's called what's
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:51.240]  meant me minute men there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice and
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:55.280]  when Paul comes screeching down the road that way they grabbed their guns and
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:00.240]  hid out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere and when the
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.900]  British come pranks and long all dressed up and in their red suits they
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:12.400]  let them have it it was a sight to see and then it happened they fired the gun
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:20.440]  they fired the gun and the shot was so loud it was heard clear around the world
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:34.040]  oh kid that's the way this country started and our so-called government says
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:39.000]  the number one threats not Al Qaeda or ISIS that they openly fund to destabilize
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:45.240]  the globe and to take our liberties as a pretext of protecting us no they say
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:49.680]  veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives Christians are the
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:54.560]  enemy because this is an alien foreign occupational government we have and
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:59.520]  that's even mainstream news now on CNBC they say we're run by foreign banks
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:03.800]  we're conquered and Goldman Sachs goes we've installed three presidents and
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:08.440]  prime ministers in Europe last year they don't even have elections in places
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:16.360]  like Italy they just put them in see we've gone from warning you this was
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:21.880]  all coming to now they've got the Asian Pacific Union one piece of it leaked by
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:25.800]  WikiLeaks ends internet freedom as we know Obama's lining that up with the
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:37.080]  FCC now globally and the other 29 pieces that's 33 pieces so the other 32 pieces
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:41.640]  they're not releasing and just saying hey you don't need to see it Congress
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:48.280]  doesn't need to see it this is over the top tyranny and it's moving very very
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:53.160]  quickly because the public is entertained to death the public is in a
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:58.760]  mesmerized trance state medically just look it up TV lowers brainwaves
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:04.520]  television associated with Alzheimer's television associated with lower IQ the
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:09.360]  public is in a spectator mode thinking that they've gotten away with
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.800]  something just being lazy not knowing the real universe is going on around
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:18.760]  them shuddered like a horse with blinders not seeing the 360 view around
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:25.680]  them just a narrow little globalist projected world and our survival
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:32.040]  instinct is being destroyed learned helplessness and our normalcy bias is
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:37.720]  being expanded to where we'll put up with anything and every historian every
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:45.120]  PhD economist or anthropologist or sociologist left right libertarian says
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:51.120]  these are the global seeds of worldwide war genocide extermination including
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:54.320]  here in America with a hundred million people not in the workforce and
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.200]  articles everywhere about driverless cars driverless planes notice it's all
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:04.320]  rolling out and I told you 20 years ago it was coming and then meanwhile we have
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:08.840]  430 something reactors that are used for power worldwide a bunch of other
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:15.240]  institutional research reactors and secret reactors and 90 plus percent of
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:18.840]  them even the UN and the federal government the atomic energy agency all
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:23.520]  of them say 91 90 percent are leaking
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:29.120]  they don't even care now when they leak in fact a few years ago San Diego and
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:32.600]  other areas had reactors nearby leaking and the alarms would go off and scare
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:36.120]  people so they just said you know what we're just going to turn the alarm off
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:44.640]  now and look at these headlines Fukushima radiation has reached North
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:47.240]  American shores we're gonna skip this network break coming up to give our
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:51.720]  guests more time this is out of the Woods Hole Oceanographic institution
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:55.880]  in the Statesman Journal and others scientists at Woods Hole say that they're
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:01.720]  picking up cesium-134 and cesium-137 for the first time hitting the
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:08.240]  West Coast since the 2011 triple meltdown well wait a minute they say
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.320]  nothing to worry about and USA Today says that and others say that well funny
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:21.560]  I've got from 2011 Forbes radiation detected in drinking water in 13
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:25.680]  Moore US City cesium-137 in a Vermont mill so they just raised the level of
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:29.440]  what they said was safe here's another one RT radiation level in tuna off
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:36.120]  Oregon coast triple after Fukushima disaster that's from 2014 your San
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.560]  Francisco gate saying the same thing Japan's radiation found in California
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:45.320]  Bluefin tuna bio-accumulate I mean I'm not gonna go to the hundreds of other
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:49.400]  reports I'm just gonna hit a few of those so even when they have to admit
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:52.120]  this I mean we sent Jakari Jackson others out there last year we should
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:56.480]  send them again to cover the water shortage in the radiator and we would
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:01.200]  go up to the water and it'd be 120 times what they say safe here and 50 times
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:05.800]  here and 30 times there and then they sent government crews out and we were in
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.240]  the San Francisco Chronicle you name it a week later going well these
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.960]  conspiracy theorists said there was higher radiation and they're right but
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:17.600]  it's not a problem kooks not a problem just 120 times you know the safe level
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:22.000]  what they go you know how to run those field meters those aren't got your
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.760]  counters same difference didn't matter the point was it was massively increased
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:30.560]  but you're not an expert we can go buy a calibrated machine three of them
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:34.600]  different brands they showed the same thing
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:43.080]  a lady catches a fish it's just off the chart you know 200 times or something
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:47.800]  all right let's go to our guest Jerry Peterman and I've had medical doctors
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:51.280]  radiologists on so many but he's the expert because he talks to all of them
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.000]  FukushimaUpdateReport.com for the leading site clearinghouse of real
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:02.400]  information to break this down he's an engineer in TV and radio and he also
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:07.640]  has the first micro computer powered micro he's just very interesting
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:10.600]  engineer I'm not going to get into all of it and he works with production
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.560]  scientific advances and such other varied disciplines as communication
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:17.760]  transportation alternative fuels environmental waste disposal satellite

[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.560]  and he's got the people on the ground in California people on the ground in
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:35.480]  Japan and he joins us now you heard my little intro sir but what do you make of
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.520]  the media and the government admitting and but say it's the first time
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:42.480]  radiation has reached but I know that's not the case and what are the real
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:48.360]  levels that we're seeing thanks for joining us thank you Alex I think the
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:54.280]  thing that's most obvious is this is very similar to brave new world where
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:01.240]  someone something goes in and and rewrites the news that's that's what
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:06.240]  they're doing is just oh that's not what we said we're rewriting it we're
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:12.360]  looking at off the coast of California in the rate of seven becquerels of
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:18.600]  radiation per cubic meter of seawater and that's that's quite a bit it's not
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:22.520]  going to probably give you cancer immediately but over a long period of
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:28.680]  time you don't want to be eating fish and in that condition you just you just
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:33.920]  don't I mean it doesn't surprise me it raised when the first started detecting
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:43.200]  it in the air in April or May of 2011 they began to reduce or increase the
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:51.760]  amount that was acceptable US nuclear agency began to increase that so it
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:18:00.480]  doesn't surprise me at all break down your research music it's so wide and so
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:06.200]  huge what are the real experts saying real experts saying we are in a world
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:12.880]  of hurt we have something that is going to be around for the next several
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:19.000]  hundred generations we're dealing with a a runaway situation that no one knows
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:25.080]  how to deal with I've written up something called insane things about
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:31.200]  Fukushima and initially everybody thought oh well we'll have this contained
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:37.560]  in a year or two we'll go in and contain the material and all this and oh yeah
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:42.480]  it's it's probably still in the containment vessel all this different
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:48.240]  to a core material they call corium so the mixture of all the radio nucleides
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:54.600]  in the plant and truth of the matter is nobody ever went into this thing and
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:19:02.040]  took a look at it and now it's been four years since this quote accident and
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:09.240]  now what we have a situation where tepco's plant sheath just in March made
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:14.440]  the statement that it's going to be a 200 year wait before we have technology
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:20.320]  that even begins to know what to do with this thing we have no viable method to
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:26.240]  deal with it and there's so many uncertainties we just really consider
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:31.240]  the problems insurmountable and this could be possibly the worst possible
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:39.720]  result centuries could pass one another plant executive said centuries may pass
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:45.520]  before humans find a way to deal with these molten core so we have no idea
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:51.120]  what to do you see the problem they're admitting now after four years the
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:20:00.160]  technology doesn't exist to deal with this and so I was always a little bit in
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:05.920]  the dark as to what are we dealing with how much material are we dealing with
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:12.520]  and what is it and we found that that the reports now indicate that at least five
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:20.920]  percent of this is plutonium activated as mox fuel and mox fuel was some people
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:26.120]  say illegally being used in there and that was the mox three reactor that had
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:29.840]  the big mushroom cloud explosion I was no engineer but I looked at the online
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:33.960]  release designs and clearly said those are the rods being shot up through the
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:37.800]  air and a year later they admitted that they shot up to two miles away but the
[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:43.120]  government here and there covered it up and so that's my big question before we
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:48.000]  walk through all this with the head of one of the leading organizations that's
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:53.960]  engaged in massive research who's human update report comm Jerry Peterman why
[02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:59.520]  do the elites not seem to care why are they building more reactors why are they
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:05.600]  letting old ones rot and loading more fuel into them I mean it's almost like
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:11.600]  they want to kill everybody I mean what is wrong with the establishment I think
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:17.400]  we've there by the way take a look at that very carefully what is the color
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:23.800]  of hydrogen when it burns hydrogen is clear it does not produce a yellow flash
[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:28.920]  the only thing that does produce a yellow flash in that kind of environment
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:34.400]  is some kind of nuclear conflict configuration and that's what Dr. Busby
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:38.040]  and other nuclear physicists have said here and then sure enough universities
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:43.040]  outside of the government did the isotope test and said yes we show that
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:50.800]  fission occurred correct that's correct and now we have people that after we've
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:57.080]  got the admission that there was fission now they're beginning to look well if
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:03.960]  there was fission I'll bet we had some neutron radiation released oh but we
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:08.280]  couldn't have had that because there were no fission well we have fission okay
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:14.040]  well let's look for it well they're finding that their estimate was 13
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:21.920]  billion times lower than was actually released in other words there is 13
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:26.360]  billion times more neutron radiation that's been released and the
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:32.800]  significant part of that is that every particle of the wastewater that's stored
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:40.840]  on site has been subjected to neutron activation and neutron activation is an
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:46.080]  interesting process radiation doesn't just go through the water every time a
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:53.000]  neutron hits a particle let's say it's magnesium floating in the sea water
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:23:00.600]  earth or iron or copper or whatever it's creating radioactive water everything
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:09.360]  that it touches a neutron touches becomes radioactive so you have got 144
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:16.000]  million gallons of water stored on site where every particle inside that those
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.720]  containment vessels are radioactive and what is the half-life if this is
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:25.680]  plutonium radiation I mean we're not talking about cesium or something that
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:31.040]  breaks down in a few months are we no that's the neat thing about and being
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:39.680]  the cesium so neat thing about nuclear power plants they keep on giving you can
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:49.200]  get the benefits of of the pollution for a half-life of uranium is is a 4.2
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:54.520]  billion years so every time we create a nuclear power plant we're creating a
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:24:00.680]  system that's going to produce waste that is gonna last 4.2 billion years oh
[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:08.160]  that's the half-life that means if it was 100 then just using a number in 4.2
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:14.560]  billion years it's going to be 50 so it would take 8 billion plus years to
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:20.840]  become non radioactive yeah probably yeah it'd be beyond the end of the
[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:24.600]  year so what is the nuclear industry thinking because when I was a kid and
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:28.240]  everything I bought in the propaganda hey don't listen to the commies nuclear
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:33.560]  power is great but then Russia has them melting down blowing up Chernobyl the
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:39.440]  cancers increase all these leaking reactors CBS news says 75% are leaking
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:43.160]  we have news articles from the atomic energy agencies you know seeing 90 plus
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.440]  percent are leaking it's like they had problems before but suddenly it seems
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:52.080]  like the establishment thinks it's good I mean are they space aliens that want
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:56.280]  to make the earth radioactive because I'm trying to be logical here you know I
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:00.080]  don't think you're too far off I'm saying there's space aliens but I will
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:05.400]  say something is something's not right these people are are certifiable if
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:09.840]  you've got a car that's smoking going down the road you'd think that probably
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.960]  at some point it's gonna stop and it's throw that pollution all the time you
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:20.160]  get these things leaking the common sense thing to do is fix them and keep
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:23.000]  going if you're gonna be in that exactly they were and of course I don't think
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.480]  it's aliens either I'm just saying they're so destructive yeah that if
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:31.320]  they're not really aliens that want to live in a radioactive environment this
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:37.200]  doesn't make sense now it doesn't make sense you got to consider the premise
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:42.720]  of producing waste that last four and a half billion years or 4.2 billion years
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:49.440]  just to create power for today that really doesn't make sense either but who's
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:54.080]  counting I don't know but I mean if they could contain it even somewhat safely
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:00.000]  you could they just 91% of the plants are leaking and it's getting worse and
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.840]  the and the these plants are supposed to stay up in 30 years a lot of them are now
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.120]  into their 40th plus year and of course for folks that don't know the
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:11.120]  radiation just eats these plants they're falling apart whistleblower I mean the
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:15.160]  old days they would poison plant workers if they warned the public about a small
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:21.320]  leak nowadays they just go hey we don't care we don't care now I'll ask you a
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:27.200]  question I bet you know this from your research where is the fuel stored since
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:31.560]  we don't use yucca flats where is the fuel stored in the United States for
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:36.560]  reactors that spent few they're generally stored I think what about 85% of the time
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:42.600]  last time I saw at the reactor sites yes and I can I can tell you for
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:52.600]  absolutely certain that most reactors have more fuel stored at at their
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:58.560]  locations than Fukushima had stored in their situations now the chance of us
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:04.000]  having some kind of tsunami is probably not gonna happen but then again we have
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:11.720]  several reactors in the Ohio basin and out on the California fault lines that
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:16.480]  are sitting on top of earthquake fault zones which that took a lot of common
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:21.120]  sense I've seen the global maps of where they store the stuff whether it's the
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:25.760]  US Japan or even it will they only seem to want to store them on earthquake lines
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:30.800]  is that a fun joke or what's that I have no idea but you have to wonder where
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:39.520]  it's stored now we've dumped 40,000 tons of nuclear material depleted uranium and
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:45.040]  that that term is not accurate it's still 30% radioactive we dumped that on
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:50.560]  Iraq and Afghanistan don't forget the Navy under orders for 30 years dumped it
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:56.520]  all off the US coast both east and west yeah I don't think you have too much
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:02.480]  problem if you're down 10 or 15,000 feet in the ocean at the bottom it's gonna
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:09.240]  sit there for a while but that really wasn't very bright either I shouldn't
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:14.600]  laugh this is just crazy I mean what can you do if you don't you don't laugh in
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  irony what are you gonna do cry about it I mean for God's sake this is this is a
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:27.520]  this is end of the world scenario for for this thing Alex I did not know what
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:33.240]  amount of material we were dealing with in the molten cores let me tell you the
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:41.240]  size of a single molten core of the three those things are 30 to 47 feet
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:47.800]  across and two stories deep underneath each one of these we're talking about
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:55.160]  something that is burning at 3,500 degrees and it is the size of a small
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:29:00.600]  building this is all one lump and update me on the specifics because I saw the
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:03.840]  articles last few months they've been covering up leaks for 10 months they
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.880]  say it's worse than ever at Fukushima absolutely it's worse than anything and
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:15.800]  when you consider all three of these reactors you're dealing with over 600,000
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.360]  pounds of this material and people say well that's a lot of that's a lot of
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:25.280]  that's a lot of pounds I don't I can't wrap my head around it okay go out in a
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:32.360]  Walmart parking lot or someplace and count 190 cars and that's the amount of
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:38.080]  material that you have melted down the equivalent 190 automobiles melt it down
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:42.160]  because they were storing it right on top the reactors Jerry Peterman Fukushima

[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:23.200]  gcm radio network radio radio radio radio. It was just about three weeks ago I
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:27.240]  saw the headlines that a bunch of the underground facilities they built in
[02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:34.700]  New Mexico to store nuclear waste was collapsing into salt mines and was full
[02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:41.700]  of salt water and brine and then a couple months I saw another report where
[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:47.220]  where they've got some stored out in California and Nevada in those areas are collapsing as
[02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:56.100]  well. I mean, it's like a joke. It's like a joke. And I want to invite Jerry Peterman
[02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:59.420]  up for a full hour in the near future and on the nightly news because we should really
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:03.640]  cover this more. I've been hammering it and hammering it, but then I'll go a year without
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:07.420]  really mentioning it. Then I'll kind of hammer it for a while, but we need to be aware of
[02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:12.940]  this because by that nuclear physicist on medical doctors, cancer doctors on and they
[02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:18.260]  go, yeah, this will increase our rates of cancer and it already has. But I've talked
[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:22.700]  to folks that lived in Europe during Chernobyl who were in Italy in other areas for six months
[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:27.980]  to a year. They ate produce from the U.S. powdered milk from other areas. They didn't
[02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:32.380]  eat the vegetables for six months to a year because they knew it was bio accumulating
[02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:36.380]  from Chernobyl all over Europe. Nowadays, they don't want anybody, even though there
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:40.620]  were some levels over 200 times higher in some of the Spanish and stuff that was tested
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:47.580]  in 2011, 2012. And the, as our guest said, the FDA would come out with the EPA and others
[02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:53.820]  and say, you know what, we're just going to raise it and say it's safe. Why not? They
[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:58.060]  didn't even try to avoid it. Hey, if you've got fast growing cells and you're a child,
[02:34:58.060 --> 02:35:02.580]  you don't want to get cancer when you're 35 or 40. Don't, you know, sorry, farmers,
[02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:06.900]  you know, you're going to have to, you know, get rid of this produce. No, they didn't want
[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:12.460]  to do that. So the world changed folks from Europe, not feeding people for six months
[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:18.420]  to a year of their food to now just, you know what? I mean, even the Soviets had people
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:23.020]  move out of the Ukraine in areas of Russia, nearby Chernobyl. Now it's just stay next
[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:28.300]  to Fukushima and they got Monbie on the left and others on the right, like, uh, in colder
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:34.460]  come out saying, you ought to go in the reactor. It's good for you. So the next six, seven
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:38.020]  minutes, sir, you've got the floor set of me asking the questions because you really
[02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:42.780]  are clearing house talking to the scientists. You name it. What is the latest on Fukushima?
[02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:48.100]  Where is it going and the other reactors? Uh, and is there any sanity because now I see
[02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:53.060]  all these leftist groups pushing micro reactors in cities and how homes might have them in
[02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:58.500]  the future and cars? I mean, I mean, these people seem to be tripling down like the vaccine
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:02.340]  makers as it shows it. You know what? We're going to get everybody more vaccines as it
[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:09.820]  shows it's hurting people. It just seems like an arrogance. So, so where is all this going?
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:14.300]  I hate to say it, but I think we're all, you know, beers cold in the game is on who the
[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:24.540]  blank cares. We're, we're so mesmerized by the media to watch the action with the stars
[02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:33.100]  or, you know, the latest, uh, Star Wars movie or whatever it is out there. I did a survey
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:46.460]  survey survey in Flugerville at a nice of my small and, uh, I asked a hundred people
[02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:54.460]  about Fukushima and of the hundred people, 30 had heard about it. And of those 30, only
[02:36:54.460 --> 02:37:01.340]  five realized that it was of any consequence whatsoever. And one fellow told me it was
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:08.500]  really, really great because, um, his friends all liked it. And I, I was a little taken
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:14.380]  back. I said, why? And he said, it's a, it's a, that's that's a new, uh, sushi place
[02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:21.660]  out on 183. Okay. I smiled and thanked him. And one lady blessed me out for not being
[02:37:21.660 --> 02:37:30.300]  very well educated since it was over within 2010. So we, we have too many things that
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:36.900]  take our mind off of what we really should be doing. And frankly, I remember my father
[02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:42.620]  being upset with 5% federal income tax. What would he think now? And I don't think there's
[02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:47.340]  anybody left who will go out and demonstrate in the streets for anything because we're
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:54.260]  pretty well convinced that none of what we do matters anymore. And, uh, you know, children,
[02:37:54.260 --> 02:37:59.700]  if you ask children, they all think, you know, grade school, basically junior higher high
[02:37:59.700 --> 02:38:04.780]  school, they think they're going to be dead anyway. Uh, things are bad and we've got people
[02:38:04.780 --> 02:38:10.860]  scared to the bone. Uh, what can you do when you're, when you're frightened? Uh, I gave
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:17.300]  a list, uh, made a list of things that I felt like, what can we do? Uh, a few health things,
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:22.380]  not eat fish and stuff like that. But I said, one of the things about, uh, the average person
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:28.340]  buying a radiation detector, I don't think it's important to do that for one reason.
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:34.140]  They don't understand what they're looking at. But the main thing is in the United States,
[02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:42.260]  uh, we are fed so much fear that I think, uh, over the long run, fear is going to do
[02:38:42.260 --> 02:38:49.420]  more biological damage to us as a society than, uh, the, the radiation that we're going
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:54.100]  to have over the next 10 years. And that's been a hundred thousand people die of cancer
[02:38:54.100 --> 02:39:01.740]  from Fukushima and elevated rate. But I think fear is going to, uh, take its toll as well.
[02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:03.220]  Nobody knows how to measure that.
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:07.740]  Well, Jerry, I think you've hit the nail on the head here. They've given us learned helplessness
[02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:11.860]  and, and, and terrified us over things like terrorism where deer jumping out in front of
[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:15.420]  your car killed more every year than that. So we're scared of all this stuff like great
[02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:19.620]  white sharks eating us, a statistic shows, one of the biggest fears out there, but five
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:23.180]  people a year get killed by him. It's basically almost impossible out of seven and a half billion
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:26.740]  people to be killed by one of them. It's like finding a leprechaun, but people are scared
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:31.820]  of that. Meanwhile, real threats, people can't seem to get focused on and they just think
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:35.260]  you're trying to scare them like everything else because they feel powerless. But the
[02:39:35.260 --> 02:39:39.660]  truth is we go through these times where it seems like nothing's happening and suddenly
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:45.940]  there's a mass awakening and things change. The big problem is we, we, we have an elite
[02:39:45.940 --> 02:39:50.180]  that doesn't want the public to be active. So the elite can do whatever they want and
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:56.540]  the elite themselves, I think are so decadent that, that they've become so megalomaniacal
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:01.020]  that they think they're invincible. And I think the radiation level spiking and all
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:10.540]  the leaks is a symptom of the disease of an elite that have become so inbred and so decadent
[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:13.340]  that a lot of their writings talk about, you know, if we don't merge with machines and
[02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:17.380]  live forever, so what, let's just blow the earth up. I mean, I think it's evil is what
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:22.500]  we're dealing with here. I can't question that. Alex, I told you a long time ago that
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:30.740]  I felt like people who work for TEPCO or various companies like that are serving soul as entities
[02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:37.060]  and it still comes down to the Supreme Court has declared that a corporation is a person
[02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:42.300]  and can spend whatever money it wants on, on boats and everything else. But if that
[02:40:42.300 --> 02:40:50.740]  is a person, there is no body. There's no physical entity there. So what we as spiritually
[02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:57.300]  would say there is no soul. So that means there's no conscious conscience. And we're
[02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:06.540]  out there serving these companies, the people who are in the nuclear field are, and you're
[02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:12.460]  serving something that has no conscience. And it's got to be one of the scariest things
[02:41:12.460 --> 02:41:18.980]  on the planet. What else can you tell me that last four and a 4.2 billion years that produces
[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:23.500]  a waste? There's nothing on the planet. I think you've hit it. That's it. We have produced
[02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:28.060]  people with all the food and all the liberty we have that are so decadent and so disconnected
[02:41:28.060 --> 02:41:34.540]  from the ground reality of the real world that they just don't care anymore about anybody
[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:39.540]  but themselves. And I don't lionize the veterans, but people that have been in combat, people
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:43.980]  that have been through serious things or aid workers that have been seen starving children
[02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:48.980]  and folks like that, people who've had real suffering or seen it, they at least get wanting
[02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:53.180]  to save freedom and wanting to stand up for others and wanting to try to be honorable.
[02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:57.060]  Doesn't mean they're perfect. And that's why the system demonizes them because they
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:42:02.860]  know veterans have actually been in the real world and they want us all to be these insulated
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:08.940]  TV heads that aren't part of reality. And I think that's it. It's a world of spectators
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:14.380]  that now look at those of us that just want to build a future. I mean, I mean, aunts save
[02:42:14.380 --> 02:42:18.860]  food for the winter. I mean, I mean, I'm not even saying we're special. We're just not
[02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:25.300]  trying to kill ourselves and they're so divorced from life that they think we're the bad guys
[02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:28.580]  because, you know, like you said, you know, people chill you out going, that was over
[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:34.020]  in 2010. That problem solves when you went out and it didn't even happen in 2010. You
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:40.140]  dumb woman. You know, it's the arrogance of these people where, where, where they, their
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:47.860]  eyes glaze over and they smile and they have these dead shark eyes and they go, oh yeah.
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:52.500]  It's like they revel in it. But, but I guarantee you, you start choking them. They're going
[02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:57.620]  to beg for the police and squeal and cry. It's like they're, they're so self centered
[02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:03.020]  that they don't have any nerve endings into the universe. It is the way I describe them.
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:08.540]  I totally agree. I like to say it. You know, they're so disconnected that they don't realize
[02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:15.300]  that they're poisoning. I have a very close friend who said, don't these people realize
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:21.820]  that they're being affected by this material? He's referring to chemtrails and all the nuclear
[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:28.540]  pollution and that kind of thing. Don't they realize that they're also being affected
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:35.900]  and their children? And I said, I don't understand. I guess it's like the old whiskey ads that
[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:43.060]  used to be in magazines that always had a skull painted somewhere in the, the ice cube or
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:49.180]  something because those people who drank heavy liquor supposedly had a death wish and it
[02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:56.060]  was a standard thing to put a skull somewhere in the ad. Maybe, maybe that's why it's called
[02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:58.460]  skull and bones. It's a death wish.
[02:43:58.460 --> 02:44:01.660]  That's it. It's a metaphysical rule. They've got to tell you, you know, I know you're close
[02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:05.740]  to Austin and last time you were on about a year ago, I invited you here, please come
[02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:09.100]  the next two weeks. We'll do a whole hour and a half, two hours and take calls. You
[02:44:09.100 --> 02:44:13.180]  can bring any exhibits, get here beforehand. We can put them up on the big screen for TV
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:17.260]  viewers and really do a special report. So Jerry, I hope you can come here in the next
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:18.260]  few weeks.
[02:44:18.260 --> 02:44:20.580]  On behalf of Jim, thank you for your work.
[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:24.420]  Well, thank you, sir. We're just, we're all just common sense trying to survive here.
[02:44:24.420 --> 02:44:25.420]  God bless you.
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:28.220]  He's thinking me. I'm thinking him. It'd be like if I looked out, my neighbor's house
[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:32.860]  was on fire. I'd run over and bang on their door and see anybody was home and I'd call
[02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:38.340]  the fire department. I don't deserve a medal for that. I mean, he doesn't deserve a medal,
[02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:42.860]  but compared to the general public, I guess we do. We've got to hold up that that's what
[02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:48.420]  you're supposed to do. I want to go to your calls. Francis, thank you for holding and
[02:44:48.420 --> 02:44:54.340]  then Jason and Jay and Tom and Rod. We'll get to all of you before the broadcast ends.
[02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:58.500]  I'm not going to belabor this long, but if you want to support the broadcast and really
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:03.860]  get some dynamite products that are the best supplements I've ever come across, I take
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:10.420]  couple times a day, a squirt of our proprietary vitamin D3, totally organic, tastes great.
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:15.380]  It's weird. I never say anything like it. Supermilt Vitality, take three squirts or
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:20.180]  more of that a day. Put that in the water. This is how I take it. I like to drink it.
[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:24.780]  There's like a fruit punch. Our Methylcobalamin, vitamin B12, the best out there, pharmaceutical
[02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:30.540]  grade, the very low price. Survival Shield, nasoniatin, X2. I'm not going to have low
[02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:36.900]  energy, you name it, but I'm telling you, this is not a game. Okay. Okay. I mean, these
[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:41.380]  are real products. Get ready to detox when you take the X2 and stuff like that. Consult
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:46.380]  a physician beforehand because people are so deficient in this type of stuff that when
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:51.460]  you finally get it, I mean, there can be some repercussions. So we're not selling snake
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:59.900]  oil folks. This is the real stuff that they don't want you to have. And I have gone from
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:07.660]  279 pounds to like 230 or so, and I got another 25, 30 to go, and I'll be my old fighting
[02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:12.380]  weight. I was actually about 185 when I really looked great, but it was really healthy, but
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:15.460]  I'm not going to try to go down that low. My medical doctor said, no, look, you're older
[02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:20.420]  now. You just need to get down to 200. And I'm going to do it by the new good Lord's
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:26.100]  Grace's, tore my Achilles, working out and hiking, had to get my hernia fixed. I have
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:32.260]  14 years and stuff like that, but I'm getting it all done and getting supercharged in just
[02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:36.700]  45 days by religiously taking the products. I was taking them off and on. I lost six pounds
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:44.260]  of fat and gained muscle. So info wars, life.com info or store.com is the big umbrella and we

[02:46:55.740 --> 02:47:00.780]  knocked him out last night, but it's not really a knockout. It's got 20 something known herbs
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:04.180]  and things that are known to just call me and smooth you out. It's great for adults

[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:48.060]  fair price. And then you find a hardcore vicious operation dedicated to savagely telling the
[02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:52.380]  truth and throwing ourselves against the globalist and just trusting in Providence.

[02:48:28.380 --> 02:48:32.460]  Let's talk to Francis been holding for an hour. I really appreciate that from New York
[02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:37.300]  then Jay and others. Welcome. Hey, how are you? Good. I would have gone to you earlier,
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:42.180]  but the phone system was glitching. Go ahead. That's not a problem. I have a couple of questions
[02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:47.540]  to ask you. First of all, but Ted Cruz, I understand that, you know, me personally ran
[02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:51.480]  close to God for me, but I have my doubts on him as well. Absolutely. You can't put your
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:55.980]  trust in any man. You know, Christ told us only put trust in God. I agree with you. Yeah,
[02:48:55.980 --> 02:49:00.060]  yeah, I just, he's just too good for me. I think like you said was correct. A couple
[02:49:00.060 --> 02:49:03.540]  of weeks ago you mentioned that as far as like, you know, he could be saying all the
[02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:08.100]  right things, but he could be part of the global agenda as well. Absolutely. But I mean, we
[02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:14.620]  know he's better than Hillary Clinton. And listen, I'm not a lesser or two evils guy.
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:17.860]  I've just learned to not look a gift towards in the mouth. I don't put all my hopes in
[02:49:17.860 --> 02:49:22.420]  a presidential run. I say take over locally with ideas and take over with with our voting
[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:31.300]  with our dollars. But yet Ted Cruz has been a little too hawkish towards Russia. He's
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:37.060]  wife is CFR, Goldman Sachs, but she resigned from that four years ago and bunch of other
[02:49:37.060 --> 02:49:42.060]  stuff. So I'll go off of how he votes. His voting record's really good compared to say
[02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:47.140]  Chuck Schumer. What do you think? Oh, I agree with you on a percent on that. I mean, but
[02:49:47.140 --> 02:49:51.420]  Chuck Schumer is a basically globalist puppet. And we all know that. I mean, if it wasn't
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:56.300]  for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, they would have passed the assault weapons ban and all these
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:50:01.420]  bans. But then I think maybe let them go ahead and ban it. Let's, you know, if they really
[02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:06.900]  want to show their cards, but you know, I just, what do you think? Well, well, yeah,
[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:11.140]  I mean, I basically you're right. I mean, basically let's let's select them. But unfortunately,
[02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:15.380]  what that is, is that like you said, we can't trust anyone as far as, you know, you know,
[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:18.220]  if they're going to be legitimate or not. Well, we got to hold their feet to the fire.
[02:50:18.220 --> 02:50:21.820]  You know, first things first, John Banner should not be the speaker of the house. John
[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:28.620]  Banner is a democratic operative. He is the he is he is the Rhino definition of a Republican
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:37.420]  in name only. He is horrible. I mean, at least Michael Moore admits he wants our guns. Banner
[02:50:37.420 --> 02:50:41.660]  goes along with it, but says he's pro gun. I mean, he's just he blocked the abortion
[02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:46.060]  bill that we had the votes in the House and Senate to ban killing seven months and eight
[02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:51.780]  month old babies. I mean, you know, John Banner is a baby killer. John Banner is a criminal
[02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:56.420]  piece of crap who's been involved in criminal operations for 30 years. He's a compromised
[02:50:56.420 --> 02:51:04.220]  rat bastard. Hey, Boomer, I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:08.300]  Good thing we have the Berkey system. It's the cleanest best water ever. Mom says it's
[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:12.740]  because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks only pure delicious
[02:51:12.740 --> 02:51:18.620]  water. I know, right? You love it too. Yeah, I'm thirsty too. Let's go get some get Berkey

[02:51:52.420 --> 02:52:00.060]  to call them. 8442 Guns80, 8442 4867-80. Hey, how you doing? Good brother. Just recently
[02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:03.860]  started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife
[02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:08.100]  both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here. Thank you brother.
[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:11.340]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I'm going to have the

[02:52:33.740 --> 02:52:40.060]  the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and
[02:52:40.060 --> 02:52:44.300]  energy drinks and stuff. Just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience
[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:48.820]  where the stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty

[02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:20.940]  The phone line. You shell out 1500 bucks. Get locked into a long term contract and think
[02:53:20.940 --> 02:53:26.060]  you're safe. But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip. And when a

[02:54:06.540 --> 02:54:10.700]  Let's not forget, there are a lot of well-meaning conservatives and liberals like Robert Kennedy
[02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:17.060]  Jr. He's come out and said that there is a vaccine-linked holocaust with millions of
[02:54:17.060 --> 02:54:21.540]  children being brainwashed. The article is on infowars.com, and he's being demonized
[02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:26.620]  and attacked. The food babe, Vani Hari, is being attacked all over because she's effective
[02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:31.020]  and she's telling the truth. Hey McDonald's, please take the silly putty plastic, plasticizer
[02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:36.700]  out of your food. I mean, it's there. They admit it. Take it out. Don't demonize Vani
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:44.180]  Hari. So we got to stand with those that stand with us to tell the truth. The Zarnev living
[02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:48.700]  brother convicted in Boston Marathon bombing said he was not guilty, but they basically
[02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:52.380]  cut his larynx out. And then his lawyer came out and said he was guilty on the news a few
[02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:57.540]  weeks ago. Boy, with defense lawyers like that, he was totally set up, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:54:57.540 --> 02:55:02.020]  to sell the police state. His brother worked for the CIA. The Russians blew his cover two
[02:55:02.020 --> 02:55:10.220]  years before. The government lied about it. It all came out. Unbelievable. And we had the
[02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:14.740]  secret service, even though Obama wasn't in town, come to press conferences with our reporter
[02:55:14.740 --> 02:55:18.060]  there. You saw it on national news. We ought to do a recap of that tonight on the nightly
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:22.100]  news. Dhamma Dondee and tell him, and tell the press, do not look at his material. Do
[02:55:22.100 --> 02:55:28.060]  not look at his pictures of the, the, the, the contractors and the black backpacks. And
[02:55:28.060 --> 02:55:34.060]  I'm not saying the contractors were involved. It was a drill. We know it was on the news.
[02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:38.420]  They ran a drill so that they could get in whoever really did it. And in case they got
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:44.140]  caught, they're a part of the drill. We know it was fake. The others aren't. That brother
[02:55:44.140 --> 02:55:48.660]  was murdered in front of everybody. He didn't kill a cop. That all came out. I don't know
[02:55:48.660 --> 02:55:55.140]  what happened, but it's fake. He's now been convicted. Jay in Texas. Thanks for holding.
[02:55:55.140 --> 02:56:02.580]  Go ahead. You're on the air. God bless you, Alex. I'm going to comment on Jade Helm 15
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:08.020]  and see what you think of this scenario. It stinks to me like Soros in the Ukraine and
[02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:13.620]  Eric Holder with FASTA Furious and OKC. Picture this, the government brings the troops into
[02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:19.860]  the area and then they come under fire by provocateurs that shoot them and shoot them.
[02:56:19.860 --> 02:56:23.420]  Sure. They could know that I would talk about the drill as I always do. Then I'd have the
[02:56:23.420 --> 02:56:27.580]  military attack by their own people and blame it on me just like under what would throw
[02:56:27.580 --> 02:56:34.220]  breakthroughs on Wendell. Yep. And then the provocateurs leave in the darkness and then
[02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:40.500]  it's blamed on gun owners. And the way to avoid this is have the troops train on base.
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:45.620]  That's right. This can happen. And this is exactly what Soros did in the Ukraine where
[02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:52.300]  those provocateurs shot police and they shot civilians to cause the agitation. And then
[02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:57.300]  this would be a call for a civilized gun owners and to move things forward. There's also a
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:03.620]  guy who had a chart of, I think it was Russian groups that were surrounding the area of the
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:09.180]  James held operation that actually like looped around it. They're all in small towns. And
[02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:13.020]  the guy goes, well, why are these guys all in these outskirts of these small towns? Why
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:16.660]  are they doing that for? And I thought that was interesting. But the thing of it is, is
[02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:21.020]  with them bringing the troops in, they're in control of the time, the territory and
[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:25.060]  the tactics all in one time. And that's what you're going to be if you're going to be a
[02:57:25.060 --> 02:57:32.380]  hunter in control of the moment. So I just wanted to see what you think on it. But that's
[02:57:32.380 --> 02:57:34.620]  what came to me.
[02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:37.780]  Anything is possible with these globalists. But I mean, the general public doesn't think
[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:41.660]  like that. Like I watched House of Cards in the first season because I've had surgery
[02:57:41.660 --> 02:57:45.740]  and I was taking an awesome time. It was clear that he threw the brick through his own window
[02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:49.820]  to blame his opposition. And I'm sitting around people watching. They go, Alex, don't think
[02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:53.220]  it's going to be. And of course, at the end, it was staged. The public doesn't think like
[02:57:53.220 --> 02:57:58.860]  that even though nine times out of 10 stuffs a false flag. Historically, World War two started
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:05.100]  with a false flag. Vietnam with a false flag. The Spanish American war with a false flag.
[02:58:05.100 --> 02:58:08.580]  It just over and over again. God bless you. I appreciate your call. We're going to go
[02:58:08.580 --> 02:58:12.580]  to overdrive. One minute break. Some stations don't carry an info wars.com, four slash show
[02:58:12.580 --> 02:58:18.480]  to find the free video feeds. We're going to Tom and then Jason and then Rod. I may
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:21.860]  have time to get to Mary, but she's been holding only about five minutes. The other's been
[02:58:21.860 --> 02:58:27.980]  holding longer. So I'm going to get to Tom, everybody. So start your engines. We're going
[02:58:27.980 --> 02:58:32.100]  to obviously in the main transmission now. Lord willing to don't take the show for granted.
[02:58:32.100 --> 02:58:35.980]  They're trying to shut down alternative media everywhere. We'll be back tomorrow. 11 a.m.
[02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:40.940]  Central. Please support our local MNF affiliates, our local sponsors or become a sponsor. God
[02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:50.140]  bless you all. If you are watching or listening, you are the resistance network. Using unparalleled
[02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:55.060]  research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts

[02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:05.540]  clinical studies. The new oxy powder available through info wars life was invented during
[02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:10.420]  Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies. Many herbal colon cleansers are
[02:59:10.420 --> 02:59:15.740]  harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of
[02:59:15.740 --> 02:59:21.060]  synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse. Gently start cleaning your body with easy
[02:59:21.060 --> 02:59:25.940]  capsules that start working while you sleep. Oxy powder does not require time off work
[02:59:25.940 --> 02:59:31.660]  and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions. Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic
[02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:36.780]  oxygen into the intestinal tract and body. Experience the astonishing cleansing power
[02:59:36.780 --> 02:59:42.820]  of super oxide and ozonide technology. Go to info wars life dot com or info wars store

[03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:18.500]  Fix bayonets. We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live
[03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:24.100]  from the front lines. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:24.100 --> 03:00:28.980]  Look at these headlines. Government demands father to most cardboard fort he built for
[03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:32.420]  his kids, but they'll let the foreign banks rob trillions, let the illegals run around
[03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:37.620]  above the law. It's all about impacting law abiding citizens. Tom in West Virginia, you're
[03:00:37.620 --> 03:00:43.380]  on the air. Go ahead. Yes, and thank you. Bless you, Alex. We enjoy listening to your
[03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:48.260]  show. I'll make it quick because I know you're off the air, but I think Jerry hit the point
[03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:52.180]  on the head and I think we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg as far as Fukushima
[03:00:52.180 --> 03:00:56.780]  goes. It would only, you know, the nuclear reactors here aren't even guarded, so it would
[03:00:56.780 --> 03:01:01.860]  only take a couple of bombs. They have all these new ground bunkers built so that, you
[03:01:01.860 --> 03:01:05.940]  know, you don't need a war. Just let the radiation take care of the people. And you
[03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:11.380]  know, I try and talk to our friends about your show and listening to it, and they react
[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:16.940]  like Barney Fife and Mayberry. They think the government's going to take care of them.
[03:01:16.940 --> 03:01:22.500]  Nothing's going to be happening. Well, they think knowing about it is work. No, it's fun
[03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:27.380]  to fight tyranny. It's fun to be informed. These people are not alive. I mean, it's
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:34.540]  scary. It is. And it's like, you know, that they don't even realize. Well, and I think
[03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:40.300]  some of it is, is like Jerry said, you've got so much going on on TV and so who needs
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:44.900]  450 TV channels to watch that takes the mind off of it. They're worrying about getting
[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:49.060]  just from paycheck to paycheck to feed their family. So the government's manipulated it
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:53.660]  to a point that they're controlling it already. That's it. Now the taxes are hoes so high.
[03:01:53.660 --> 03:01:58.740]  They're saying, turn your guns in and we'll say forget your taxes. And the other thing
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:03.580]  that was surprising to me is, you know, they've got CERN from what I heard up and going and
[03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:07.860]  the last blood moon is in September. And I heard one of the scientists talking and
[03:02:07.860 --> 03:02:12.260]  she said, well, it would be about a year before they could find out anything or it could
[03:02:12.260 --> 03:02:17.420]  be in September. So I'm actually wondering if we even have to worry about the election
[03:02:17.420 --> 03:02:18.420]  and the next election.
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:24.260]  Well, we know the elites are obsessed with astrology and astrophysics, which grew out
[03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:28.740]  of astrology. And I mean, whether it's real or not, they're obsessed with it. And I've
[03:02:28.740 --> 03:02:33.140]  never heard of so many lunar eclipses. I mean, it seems like every week, it's I wake up
[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:35.340]  in the middle of the night, go to the bathroom, look out the window, there's some giant red
[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:38.780]  moon out the window. I mean, I've never seen anything like it in my life. It's getting
[03:02:38.780 --> 03:02:42.740]  crazy. So we'll follow all that. God bless you. Good to hear from you, Tom. Jason in
[03:02:42.740 --> 03:02:44.900]  New York, thanks for holding here on the ear.
[03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:52.860]  Hi, Alex. I was wondering, was there ever a bulletin or a recall or any type of formal
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:57.060]  explanation given by Mercedes Benz for Michael Hastings assassination?
[03:02:57.060 --> 03:03:00.820]  Nope. I mean, he said, I'm being chased by a special federal unit. I'm running for my
[03:03:00.820 --> 03:03:05.700]  life, told friends and family, they blew his car up. And then we, I mean, I know folks,
[03:03:05.700 --> 03:03:09.420]  Biggs was really good friends when they went to the funeral. The wife was all freaked out.
[03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:13.740]  I'm going to do something about it. I'm going to stop him. And then she goes on TV and says,
[03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:17.980]  his car was on fire. He's loving. I love the government. And of course, she worked for
[03:03:17.980 --> 03:03:25.420]  the National Security Council as one of only two assistants in the actual council rooms.
[03:03:25.420 --> 03:03:31.380]  And folks, the National Security Council runs the show. It is the top of the pyramid. And
[03:03:31.380 --> 03:03:36.580]  General Jones, when he ran it, said, I take my daily orders from Henry Kissinger. So I
[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:42.580]  mean, his, I'm not going to say, I mean, clearly Hastings was a, some type of commando and his
[03:03:42.580 --> 03:03:45.980]  wife is a spook as well. If you ask me, what do you think?
[03:03:45.980 --> 03:03:50.860]  Well, I do. I think it's an atrocity would happen to him and others like him, like Gary
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:56.060]  Webb and Aaron Schwartz. But why is it, if I owned a Mercedes Benz, I'd like to know, well,
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:03:59.340]  hey, this, this car just happened to explode and fly down the street.
[03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:05.420]  Well, it's a flying carpet. No, I agree. Exactly. Yeah, we never heard why that car. I mean, I mean,
[03:04:05.420 --> 03:04:10.580]  if a Chevy blew up like that, it'd be a recall. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, look at the Pentos in the
[03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:15.820]  70s. So, you know, like I said, if I owned a Benz, I'd really want to know. I'd be like, you know
[03:04:15.820 --> 03:04:20.540]  what, I want to get rid of this car now ASAP. So Benz and all these other companies like
[03:04:20.540 --> 03:04:25.260]  GE is with the Mark reactors and Fukushima, they're all complicit in this fascist, in this
[03:04:25.260 --> 03:04:31.420]  fascist operation. I agree with you. I apologize to Rod and Mary. If you want to call back tomorrow
[03:04:32.460 --> 03:04:36.220]  and tell John, hey, I was left on hold of the day. Whenever you can get back in, well,
[03:04:36.220 --> 03:04:40.540]  you'll go to the head of the line. We're out of time. Thanks for putting up with me, folks.
[03:04:40.540 --> 03:04:44.460]  I'm just a washer on the wall, screaming, bloody murder. Don't claim I get it all right or have
[03:04:44.460 --> 03:04:49.500]  all the answers, but we all know things are getting crazy. So you don't have to be perfect
[03:04:49.500 --> 03:04:54.780]  either. Just ring the alarm, warn people, shake the public out of their trance. Don't get too mad
[03:04:54.780 --> 03:05:20.060]  at them. These are victims of mind control. Feel sorry for them. Pray for them.
