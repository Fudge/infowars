[00:32.400 --> 00:37.160]  Alex Jones Alex taking a well-deserved vacation but Bob Daisy will be

[00:42.000 --> 00:46.640]  doing fantastic I haven't seen you for a few months and I'm glad to see you I
[00:46.640 --> 00:50.440]  know you were on my show about three times the last year and and so I think
[00:50.440 --> 00:53.760]  I already know you're pretty good and I'll try to say something I mean you're
[00:53.760 --> 00:58.120]  kind of a chatterbox so I'll just try to stick something when I can oh yeah Bob
[00:58.120 --> 01:02.640]  of course has his access TV show out here in beautiful Austin Texas it is great
[01:02.640 --> 01:05.920]  out here you know I come in here without even a jacket and they're getting
[01:05.920 --> 01:11.400]  jacked in northeast with just you know the global warming storm of the century
[01:11.400 --> 01:15.800]  apparently apparently this is what global warming is you get 8 to 16 inches of
[01:15.800 --> 01:19.680]  snow and ice and skin burning temperatures from the cold I've been
[01:19.680 --> 01:24.320]  told by the global warming experts that it's because of my pickup truck you know
[01:24.320 --> 01:30.080]  what maybe the global warming experts include Obama's new global warming czar
[01:30.080 --> 01:34.200]  this is a few days old now it is out of the Washington Times she's listed as one
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.480]  of the 14 leaders of the socialist groups commission for a sustainable world
[01:38.480 --> 01:42.000]  society that's a sustainable world society and of course they're always
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.960]  talking about overpopulation people like Joe Biden and of course they are
[01:45.960 --> 01:49.600]  calling for global governance but Obama doesn't seem to have a problem with that
[01:49.600 --> 01:54.600]  I wonder why that's because it change is not change I mean we're talking about
[01:54.600 --> 01:58.320]  that with the old CFR members and it was a new CFR members now I don't think she
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.800]  is a CFR member but I'm sure if she's a member of that society she's a globalist
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.880]  she's a one-worlder you know I mean that's all they're doing they're just
[02:06.880 --> 02:09.960]  bringing out the new one-worlders and replacing them with the old one-worlders
[02:09.960 --> 02:13.000]  it's what you call change and I've been just pumping through the news in the
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.840]  first five minutes so you were telling me that Obama had a new appointment
[02:16.840 --> 02:24.680]  earlier today yeah I understand that he appointed Richard Haas to be one of his
[02:24.680 --> 02:28.680]  foreign policy advisors and of those of you who don't know who Richard Haas is
[02:28.680 --> 02:33.280]  he's only the the president or the chairman or whatever of the council on
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.760]  foreign relations he's the head guy at the CFR and so he's going to be advising
[02:37.760 --> 02:41.520]  about I'm telling Obama what to do I mean advising wait man I'm not sure
[02:41.520 --> 02:44.680]  which I meant there I think he's gonna be telling Obama what to do I would
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.040]  pretty much assume that most people are going to be telling Obama what to do and
[02:49.040 --> 02:52.840]  how to say it in front of crowds because this is a guy that is just a state
[02:52.840 --> 02:58.080]  senator up until 2004 magically running for Senate gets the keynote address at
[02:58.080 --> 03:02.440]  the 2004 Democratic National Convention well then wins his little Senate spot
[03:02.440 --> 03:06.640]  and right out of the gates I mean there have been people in the Senate for years
[03:06.640 --> 03:11.080]  and years and years but right out of the gates he's up for the presidency the
[03:11.080 --> 03:16.280]  literally less than three years in the Senate and you know what I'm running for
[03:16.280 --> 03:20.280]  president I'm doing it they've groomed him very well they've watered him they
[03:20.280 --> 03:25.680]  pull the weeds and you know here here comes Obama he's their guy and there's
[03:25.680 --> 03:29.200]  no question about it and he's gonna do exactly what they tell him to do he is a
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.320]  he is a front man for an oligarchy and that's it yes and you know what they
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.160]  they've packaged him so well that ESPN is going to be carrying the
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.880]  inauguration for the first time history and you know what the reason I'm
[03:42.880 --> 03:46.520]  making this point is because I don't catch a whole lot of TV when I'm home
[03:46.520 --> 03:49.920]  but I'll be over at my buddy's house and I usually flip through the news
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.600]  stations but I also like to check you know see how the Yankees of the Knicks
[03:53.600 --> 03:56.080]  are doing you know the Knicks we're having a little bit better a season I
[03:56.080 --> 04:00.400]  haven't seen anything ESPN in a while so I have no idea but I see Obama's face
[04:00.400 --> 04:04.800]  on ESPN and I'm like all right now this isn't the commercial for Obama this is
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.240]  in the middle ESPN Sports Center I'm like what's going on here and my buddy's
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.720]  like you haven't heard I'm like I obviously not Obama is for having a
[04:13.720 --> 04:18.600]  college football playoff now I'm not big into college football but when I do
[04:18.600 --> 04:21.720]  watch college basketball it's usually March Madness it's the tournament and
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.040]  I'm thinking to myself that's a great idea well yeah I mean that'll make that
[04:26.040 --> 04:29.400]  will make him you'll like him now if he's gonna be for a college playoff let's
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.040]  that's a that's a very key central issue in the United States of America today
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.200]  it has really is going along to get along in because it seems good I don't
[04:37.200 --> 04:39.640]  have to know how the country works I don't have to know if there's checks and
[04:39.640 --> 04:42.560]  balances I don't have to know if this is a good guy he likes college football

[08:12.920 --> 08:17.560]  made fabled enemies loose change Final Cut and get both over info wars.com
[08:17.560 --> 08:21.000]  right now we're with Bob Dacey and I just want to remind everybody we have a
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.080]  jam-packed show Bob we're gonna have Willem and I hope I'm not pronouncing this
[08:26.080 --> 08:29.480]  all right Willem Boutaire and he's gonna be talking about the financial
[08:29.480 --> 08:35.840]  collapse he's a Bank of England England policymaker and I guess we
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.160]  oversimplified unprecedented dollar collapse so you know we're gonna we're
[08:40.160 --> 08:44.120]  gonna straighten it out at the top of the next hour then at 130 we're gonna
[08:44.120 --> 08:48.880]  have officer Jack Mclam part of the Patriot movement for 20 plus years now
[08:48.880 --> 08:53.040]  a real veteran in this and you know sometimes when I'm in Vanderbilt
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.920]  archives and I'm going through and looking for you know global government
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.120]  stuff often they used to go to Jack Mclam so he's in these news clips in the
[09:02.120 --> 09:06.760]  early 80s and whatnot and then of course we're gonna have Russell Wood on at
[09:06.760 --> 09:10.000]  two o'clock for property rights we're gonna take your calls in the second half
[09:10.000 --> 09:18.880]  of the hour jam-packed show and I want to touch again on the point that the old
[09:18.880 --> 09:22.840]  boss looks the same as the new boss it looks like you know we're just trading
[09:22.840 --> 09:27.200]  in for more CFR guys and that you know one of the other things I talked about
[09:27.200 --> 09:31.840]  was earlier before the show is who is Bush gonna pardon in these last five
[09:31.840 --> 09:36.240]  days so take it from there Bob what do you think about the CFR thing look it's
[09:36.240 --> 09:39.840]  kind of like it's kind of like the treads on a on a car you know they're just
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.400]  they're rotating the tires and right now they're pretty much bringing back in
[09:43.400 --> 09:46.720]  the Clinton people and that's what they're doing I mean it's just nothing
[09:46.720 --> 09:50.520]  but old Clinton people so they're just rotating the tires but the vehicles the
[09:50.520 --> 09:53.520]  same vehicle it's going in the same direction and you know I want to touch
[09:53.520 --> 09:57.320]  on that too because Ray McGovern came on yesterday and he's a big fan of Leon
[09:57.320 --> 10:05.640]  Panetta and and really yeah he's a he was he was a man of integrity hey I like
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.160]  to have everybody on the show I like to have everybody give their viewpoint so
[10:09.160 --> 10:12.320]  sure you know I'm gonna challenge him on some things but you know the
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.400]  administration is not in yet so I'm gonna give him a little grace period but
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.160]  Leon Panetta was that was one of the chief of staffs of the Clinton
[10:20.160 --> 10:24.680]  administration during the selling of the bedroom scandals I'm sure he was into
[10:24.680 --> 10:29.840]  a lot a lot more than that he may be pro civil rights but Panetta doesn't seem
[10:29.840 --> 10:35.960]  like the best guy in the world then of course we have around Manuel he he
[10:35.960 --> 10:39.160]  basically said he didn't like the appointment of around Manuel as Obama's
[10:39.160 --> 10:43.280]  chief of staff but Rahm of course dual Israeli citizen talks about
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.200]  conscription we've been talking about that a lot on the show lately is there a
[10:46.200 --> 10:50.120]  list for dual Israeli citizens that's actually like okay here it is an
[10:50.120 --> 10:53.920]  official list I'm a citizen of Israel here it says it right here and then I'm
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.360]  also a citizen in the United States to me you shouldn't be a dual citizen of
[10:58.360 --> 11:03.320]  anything if you want to be in the United States government am I wrong yeah it
[11:03.320 --> 11:07.080]  certainly seems like there would be a conflict of interest there you hear
[11:07.080 --> 11:10.760]  what his dad said when when they found out that Rahm of Manuel was gonna be
[11:10.760 --> 11:14.480]  chief of staff did you know I haven't heard no please but enlightening what
[11:14.480 --> 11:18.400]  what is his dad is is from Israel he's an Israeli and he was one of the fighters
[11:18.400 --> 11:23.120]  back in the good old days you know all the good old days and so he said that
[11:23.120 --> 11:26.760]  he was asked about his son well what what do you think about him being a
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.440]  chief of staff and he in the White House and he said he's not gonna be in
[11:30.440 --> 11:34.960]  there like an Arab white washing the floors I mean he says this you know
[11:34.960 --> 11:38.280]  it's like whoa what do you think he's gonna be an Arab in there washing the
[11:38.280 --> 11:43.160]  floors who I mean wait a minute here I mean whatever happened to all those
[11:43.160 --> 11:48.440]  Muslims for Obama I think gonna be sorely sorely disappointed because you
[11:48.440 --> 11:55.480]  got this Israeli agent as Obama's formers his she was that's that I mean you
[11:55.480 --> 11:59.280]  got an Israeli agent as Obama's chief of staff I can see these videos where you
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.680]  have these these Muslims holding up their cards Muslims for Obama oh yeah
[12:03.680 --> 12:07.240]  guess what you're gonna get the short end of the stick again guys and well you
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.520]  know what again they've packaged this guy you know yes we can and my catchphrase
[12:12.520 --> 12:18.040]  is no you didn't yeah basically everything that you know people were like
[12:18.040 --> 12:21.960]  we're gonna get out of the war yes we can and a few months in I'll be saying
[12:21.960 --> 12:26.840]  no you didn't and actually what they did is they redistributed forces from Iraq
[12:26.840 --> 12:31.840]  into Afghanistan they created a media quagmire there how about the expression
[12:31.840 --> 12:36.400]  you've been had yeah well they've been had for sure but you know I all these
[12:36.400 --> 12:39.360]  people think that so much is going to change I want to let them know no I
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.480]  think what should change let me tell you what should change yes you asked me
[12:42.480 --> 12:47.160]  about you asked me about the pardons yes you know I don't know why you pardon
[12:47.160 --> 12:50.920]  drug dealers and any all these people it doesn't make any sense to me they were
[12:50.920 --> 12:56.640]  your best source for blow that's why I don't understand what people however I
[12:56.640 --> 13:01.080]  do understand pardoning Ramos and Compián that's who we should be pardoning
[13:01.080 --> 13:05.960]  pardoning the two war patrol agents who are railroaded into prison on the word
[13:05.960 --> 13:10.800]  of a illegal alien drug smuggler who had 700 pounds of marijuana in his van now
[13:10.800 --> 13:14.320]  those guys need to be pardoned yeah but that's not gonna happen I was telling
[13:14.320 --> 13:19.920]  you well because we don't live in a world of righteousness and good a world
[13:19.920 --> 13:24.080]  of righteousness and good is really like fairy tales rainbows and leprechauns my
[13:24.080 --> 13:28.600]  man they just don't exist and especially at the executive level these guys are
[13:28.600 --> 13:34.040]  never care about them he cares about his buddies on the street be a PR thing to
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.680]  make him look good you know do what good luck at that campaign and you got five
[13:38.680 --> 13:43.240]  days wait one thing right do one thing right in your presidency think about it
[13:43.240 --> 13:47.560]  he could go out on a positive note if he pardoned Ramos and Compián I don't think
[13:47.560 --> 13:53.680]  he could go out on a pop positive note if he I'm trying to take where what would
[13:53.680 --> 13:56.800]  be that out there's nothing he could do to go out of a positive note nothing
[13:56.800 --> 14:00.200]  nothing I don't even think that they could roll up in London tomorrow and he
[14:00.200 --> 14:04.000]  would go on a positive note man I think it would go a long way seriously I mean
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.880]  he needs somebody how about Obama Obama when he gets into pardon Ramos and
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.920]  Compián those two guys are rotten in prison for the for no good reason they
[14:12.920 --> 14:16.440]  shouldn't be part can't the can't the governor of that state also pardon them
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.680]  I don't know I'm pretty sure they don't even need a presidential part I'm
[14:20.680 --> 14:24.760]  think they do now I think you can get a governor's part well the president's a
[14:24.760 --> 14:29.160]  few he needs a he needs the both of me the presidential pardon well period I'm
[14:29.160 --> 14:32.720]  just wondering when the headline is going to be the Libby gets his pardon
[14:32.720 --> 14:36.880]  they already commuted his sentence scooter yeah little scoot scoot well he
[14:36.880 --> 14:40.440]  probably will get a pardon because probably he's he's a big I'm waiting for
[14:40.440 --> 14:44.600]  I'm I'm shocked well I guess he's done his last press conference what's
[14:44.600 --> 14:47.680]  Bush waiting for he's probably got dirt on everybody so they're gonna pardon him
[14:47.680 --> 14:51.440]  oh my god does he have dirt well come on he was what the chief of staff for
[14:51.440 --> 14:55.440]  Cheney right yeah yeah absolutely got dirt on everyone mountain and dirt
[14:55.440 --> 14:59.760]  speaking of you know new policies and whatever see that here's here's another
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.720]  illusion this is off the wire today on CNN Guantanamo Bay detention facility
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.200]  will be closed as holder the new attorney general the attorney general
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.440]  does me I'm he said Thursday the the detention center at Guantanamo Bay Q
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.760]  will be closed after president elect Obama takes office but not as soon as
[15:16.760 --> 15:19.000]  the administration would like so in other words it's going to take a little
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.800]  while second the physical act of closing the facility isn't a problem noted
[15:22.800 --> 15:27.600]  holder the more pressing question he said is the fate of the roughly 250
[15:27.600 --> 15:31.400]  inmates that are inside of it so in other words they're still going to be
[15:31.400 --> 15:34.960]  detained a couple of them are going to be extradited but there are others that
[15:34.960 --> 15:39.080]  they can't here it is a third group of inmates holder indicated can't be tried
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.760]  for a variety of reasons like the fact that they got any no evidence on not
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.920]  none and they'd still like to torture them somewhere so but also can't be
[15:46.920 --> 15:50.560]  released because they are too dangerous for that reason the Obama
[15:50.560 --> 15:54.160]  administration won't be able to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility as
[15:54.160 --> 15:57.800]  soon as we'd like why don't I just send the goat herds back where they came
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.080]  from so they can herd their goats yeah it's pretty unbelievable to me I mean
[16:02.080 --> 16:05.880]  come on you're talking about something it's 250 people
[16:05.880 --> 16:11.120]  that's not even like a county prison if they need to move that here it gets
[16:11.120 --> 16:14.000]  it's moved in a week they gotta move those prisoners they're redistributed in
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.560]  a week yeah it's it's very possible they could do this in a country they
[16:17.560 --> 16:21.360]  shouldn't even be at this point well then then we can't close Guantanamo can
[16:21.360 --> 16:24.680]  we have to keep it open to keep the 250 guys with no charges against them in
[16:24.680 --> 16:28.320]  prison for the rest of the last right it's unbelievable to me man I mean can
[16:28.320 --> 16:34.240]  you imagine being I mean people out there you know who are I'm just gonna say
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.720]  who are lazy do nothing just depressed people you know those people that just
[16:38.720 --> 16:41.720]  to complain all the time I didn't get this I know times are tough right now
[16:41.720 --> 16:44.840]  yeah not saying that that's everybody but those people who are always like
[16:44.840 --> 16:50.040]  everybody knows one of these oh I can't do it my life is so horrible yeah let me
[16:50.040 --> 16:54.840]  tell you whose life is horrible all right we are so spoiled and privileged in
[16:54.840 --> 16:59.400]  this country even though the poorest of the poor have a shot here to at least
[16:59.400 --> 17:03.960]  live a decent life if you go to a third-world nation for try living in
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.040]  Brazil without any real money or a career for a month I think that's gonna be
[17:08.040 --> 17:10.920]  pretty rough on people then then go to Haiti you're gonna get the next level
[17:10.920 --> 17:16.560]  then think about being a tortured goat herder from Afghanistan in Guantanamo
[17:16.560 --> 17:21.400]  Bay those are the people that have it rough I mean any day of the week you
[17:21.400 --> 17:25.960]  could be raped or have your skull bashed in or a dog sicked on you and while
[17:25.960 --> 17:29.640]  it's happening people are going to take video and pictures and laugh about it
[17:29.640 --> 17:33.320]  yeah these are supposed to be the liberators yeah we're the good guy we're
[17:33.320 --> 17:37.080]  the good guys it's absolutely oh and I don't even like to think that way because
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.500]  most soldiers just like most people in the FBI most people in the CIA are good
[17:41.500 --> 17:46.920]  people but like this article shows not everybody in those agencies you know
[17:46.920 --> 17:51.880]  our good guys you don't believe torture works no but that Obama's dilemma the
[17:51.880 --> 17:55.240]  cover article on Newsweek says it's a little less gray than that and Obama
[17:55.240 --> 18:02.040]  should keep all the executive powers that the Cheney and Bush administration
[18:02.040 --> 18:09.400]  put into effect ex FBI agent sentenced to 40 years in mob hit so it's only a
[18:09.400 --> 18:12.800]  couple paragraphs why not really saying he crossed over to the dark side a
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.880]  judge Thursday sentenced a former FBI agent to 40 years in prison to run to
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.800]  consecutively to the prison sentence he is now serving for the 1982 mob related
[18:21.800 --> 18:26.160]  killing of a witness who was about to testify against the Boston mob members
[18:26.160 --> 18:31.680]  court officials said John Connolly jr. 68 was convicted so back in the back in
[18:31.680 --> 18:35.960]  the 80s who knew it you know he took a little scratch from the mob and ice the
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.880]  witness the FBI I can't believe it really could they pot could people within
[18:40.880 --> 18:47.680]  the FBI possibly be dirty can you say wake up yeah right those people animals
[18:47.680 --> 18:52.680]  I mean literally treated you know women and children as less than animals I
[18:52.680 --> 18:56.120]  think you know usually animals will get a fair shake you know you'll have to
[18:56.120 --> 19:01.000]  shoot a deer with a rifle these guys were using like literally automatic
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.040]  weapons off of helicopters spraying them and oh the tank that's right the tank
[19:07.040 --> 19:11.760]  yeah it was tanks and tear gas and fire and other such thing of course that
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.040]  wasn't that was you know that was then that was during the Clinton
[19:16.040 --> 19:20.660]  administration back when times were bad but no I'm thinking about the weapons
[19:20.660 --> 19:25.360]  let the the the FB was the name of the guy who ran the FBI lab and get in
[19:25.360 --> 19:32.160]  California talking Wacken hut no the FBI guy had a head of their head of their
[19:32.160 --> 19:36.240]  operation in California he he spilled the beans on how they were fabricating

[25:05.560 --> 25:09.200]  of engagement with the rules and yeah and uh... you know so you know the fb
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.640]  i i i i firmly believe that your average fb is a good guy
[25:13.640 --> 25:15.280]  is working for the country doing this thing
[25:15.280 --> 25:18.160]  and they're great except for when it gets into an area where they run into
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.680]  something politically incorrect that that there are superior say uh... you
[25:21.680 --> 25:22.720]  can't be doing that
[25:22.720 --> 25:26.240]  and like you know robert right the one who was trailing all the money coming
[25:26.240 --> 25:28.880]  in from the islamic charities coming in this country
[25:28.880 --> 25:32.840]  you know he was working on that and uh... then they told me shut up you know
[25:32.840 --> 25:35.760]  you can lose your job can be big trouble if you keep following its money truck as
[25:35.760 --> 25:37.560]  it goes in the wrong place
[25:37.560 --> 25:39.280]  you know he went public he started
[25:39.280 --> 25:40.320]  and uh...
[25:40.320 --> 25:43.240]  uh... judicial watch with him and they had a press conference they was kind of
[25:43.240 --> 25:45.920]  crying he said we could stop nine one one but
[25:45.920 --> 25:47.240]  you know they told us that
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.040]  back off the line and all that stuff well you know
[25:50.040 --> 25:53.280]  uh... he stumbled in an area that was
[25:53.280 --> 25:56.320]  no no it was a no no so they say they call mom
[25:56.320 --> 25:59.560]  so you have to be a fb i h and i'm sure is a good guy
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.720]  i i totally and completely agree with you but uh...
[26:03.720 --> 26:06.800]  corruption breeds corruption when you're corrupt agency
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.520]  and uh... you're you're forced to cover something up right away you're more
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.640]  apt to do something more dirty and more dirty and i like the people that keep
[26:13.640 --> 26:14.520]  their mouth shut
[26:14.520 --> 26:16.760]  and play it dirty and that's why you've seen
[26:16.760 --> 26:19.840]  you know people like robert moeller that that's a mirror on the whole
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.080]  government i mean higher up you get in the food chain the more corrupt to get
[26:24.080 --> 26:27.280]  this this country if you compare it to a fish
[26:27.280 --> 26:30.620]  is rotting from the head down not from the tail up
[26:30.620 --> 26:33.680]  and i think that that that that's that's a mirror of the country that
[26:33.680 --> 26:35.000]  the corruption
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.760]  you know the scum rises to the top and that's the problem
[26:38.760 --> 26:40.160]  that it is the problem
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.440]  we're gonna be taking your calls in the next segment
[26:42.440 --> 26:44.720]  uh... will embouchure at the top of the hour
[26:44.720 --> 26:47.760]  i want to read this article uh... that steve watson did
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.240]  uh... looks like a little over a week ago bank of england policymaker predicts
[26:51.240 --> 26:54.280]  unprecedented dollar collapse now apparently
[26:54.280 --> 26:57.040]  we're over simplifying with the dollar collapse but i'm just going to read the
[26:57.040 --> 26:59.280]  article and he will correct me
[26:59.280 --> 27:02.320]  uh... when he comes on the show a former member of the bank of england's on
[27:02.320 --> 27:05.920]  monetary policy committee has predicted a massive collapse of the dollar within
[27:05.920 --> 27:07.600]  the next two to five years
[27:07.600 --> 27:10.960]  warning that a government increase in spending under president elect obama
[27:10.960 --> 27:12.600]  could be disastrous
[27:12.600 --> 27:15.000]  will embouchure who served on the b o e
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.960]  from june nineteen ninety seven to may two thousand
[27:17.960 --> 27:21.000]  has stated that he expects to see the plug pulled from under the dollar as
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.200]  foreign investors turn away from the dollar
[27:23.200 --> 27:27.000]  and other u s backed assets including government bonds
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.880]  writing for the financial times boots are now a professor with the london
[27:29.880 --> 27:32.600]  school of european economics
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.440]  there will be long uh... there will before long my best guess in between two
[27:36.440 --> 27:40.240]  and five years from now be a global dumping of u s dollar assets
[27:40.240 --> 27:44.320]  including u.s. government assets old habits die hard the u.s. dollar and u.s.
[27:44.320 --> 27:45.520]  treasury bills
[27:45.520 --> 27:49.680]  and bonds are still viewed as a safe haven by many but learning takes up
[27:49.680 --> 27:51.600]  place so there you go
[27:51.600 --> 27:52.800]  i would say that's
[27:52.800 --> 27:54.640]  pretty much predicting its collapse
[27:54.640 --> 27:57.520]  i would think i mean what what is the uh... i'm curious to find out when he
[27:57.520 --> 28:00.520]  comes on what is he griping about i mean these are quotes from what he said so
[28:00.520 --> 28:04.320]  it's going to be i guess he didn't use the term uh... collapse in that in that
[28:04.320 --> 28:05.880]  paragraph so
[28:05.880 --> 28:11.240]  you know i will like i said we'll have a mon will get his perspective is i am
[28:11.240 --> 28:14.000]  not an economist i am uh... just a
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.200]  you know lowly filmmaker and radio show host yeah and i'm just a lowly
[28:18.200 --> 28:21.720]  retail hardware store owner and if you get down to the point you know that's
[28:21.720 --> 28:25.120]  what i am we are the simpletons small business man that's what i am that's
[28:25.120 --> 28:25.720]  right
[28:25.720 --> 28:28.280]  alright so i want to talk a little bit about conscription we plan these
[28:28.280 --> 28:31.200]  clips a lot on the show because i think it's important
[28:31.200 --> 28:34.400]  this guy has uh... basically been parading around the media now the last
[28:34.400 --> 28:35.200]  couple years
[28:35.200 --> 28:38.560]  tom blankley he's an editor over at the washington times
[28:38.560 --> 28:40.720]  and he's been calling for conscription
[28:40.720 --> 28:44.360]  uh... he plays the fact off that his son is a lieutenant in the uh... military
[28:44.360 --> 28:45.160]  and
[28:45.160 --> 28:49.560]  of course they need help the more people but he goes on uh... msnbc
[28:49.560 --> 28:50.840]  and he says
[28:50.840 --> 28:53.600]  this is in two thousand seven that's not gonna happen
[28:53.600 --> 28:55.520]  under the bush administration
[28:55.520 --> 28:58.440]  so we're gonna play that clip and then we're going to play the clip from i
[28:58.440 --> 28:59.680]  believe monday
[28:59.680 --> 29:02.720]  he just launched his new book american grip monday where he's calling for
[29:02.720 --> 29:03.680]  conscription again
[29:03.680 --> 29:07.280]  but this time it's more of a friendly audience at fox and friends
[29:07.280 --> 29:08.440]  our good buddies there
[29:08.440 --> 29:10.760]  alright so let's go to the msnbc clip
[29:10.760 --> 29:11.640]  tuition
[29:11.640 --> 29:14.720]  of the military draft should be considered
[29:14.720 --> 29:17.720]  and has always been an option on the table
[29:17.720 --> 29:21.320]  the pentagon spokesman frontly rejected the idea today
[29:21.320 --> 29:24.400]  saying that the military is giving the idea quote
[29:24.400 --> 29:27.800]  absolutely no consideration all right we're going to play the rest of those
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.480]  clips on the other side is the alex jones show will be taking your calls i
[29:31.480 --> 29:38.480]  am jason vermice with bob daisy info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv

[29:54.920 --> 30:01.920]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:01.920 --> 30:03.680]  hello i'm steve shank
[30:03.680 --> 30:07.560]  many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election
[30:07.560 --> 30:08.620]  the inauguration
[30:08.620 --> 30:10.240]  not the election
[30:10.240 --> 30:13.520]  is the deadline given by the obama insiders for completing your food

[30:18.240 --> 30:21.080]  possibly the twenty first or twenty second of january
[30:21.080 --> 30:24.720]  the new president would be forced by an international incident
[30:24.720 --> 30:27.520]  to make some unpopular decisions
[30:27.520 --> 30:32.040]  this functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have
[30:32.040 --> 30:36.280]  the unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of
[30:36.280 --> 30:37.400]  transportation
[30:37.400 --> 30:40.000]  and availability of food distribution
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.500]  order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the
[30:43.500 --> 30:45.680]  inauguration to allow for shipping

[34:27.160 --> 34:30.960]  they are let's play the msnbc clip
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.760]  with no end in sight us involvement in the iraq war george bush is so-called
[34:35.760 --> 34:38.880]  war czar general douglas lute
[34:38.880 --> 34:42.800]  told national public radio on friday that reinstitution
[34:42.800 --> 34:45.880]  of the military draft should be considered
[34:45.880 --> 34:48.880]  and has always been an option on the table
[34:48.880 --> 34:52.480]  the pentagon spokesman fratley rejected the idea today
[34:52.480 --> 34:55.560]  saying that the military is getting the idea quote
[34:55.560 --> 34:57.880]  absolutely no consideration
[34:57.880 --> 34:59.280]  unquote
[34:59.280 --> 35:03.960]  but is it time to revive conscription for the first time since richard nixon
[35:03.960 --> 35:06.400]  back to discuss it or democratic strategist
[35:06.400 --> 35:07.600]  stefanie cutter
[35:07.600 --> 35:12.080]  and editor of the washington times at a page editorial page tony blankly
[35:12.080 --> 35:13.160]  tony uh...
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.320]  adjusting me political year
[35:15.320 --> 35:18.160]  nobody's going to recommend a return to the draft
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.280]  but is the draft a good idea or is a partial draft a good idea
[35:22.280 --> 35:24.720]  we got five thousand troops in the army
[35:24.720 --> 35:27.760]  it is breaking according to the army chief of staff
[35:27.760 --> 35:31.640]  on the basis of two small gorilla wars
[35:31.640 --> 35:33.600]  now is the u s army
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.480]  big enough and strong enough to handle all the commitments of scott's got it's
[35:37.480 --> 35:39.600]  not going to happen on bush's watch
[35:39.600 --> 35:43.800]  because it's not time for for for that debate to occur
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.760]  the military clearly is not big enough to do the job that can be required of it
[35:48.760 --> 35:52.400]  uh... in a world that we live in today in the end of the foreseeable future is
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.800]  you say to small wars and we're almost tapped out as far as i was uh... let's
[35:56.800 --> 35:58.640]  go ahead and we'll see because uh...
[35:58.640 --> 36:01.720]  right there in two thousand seven it's not time for that debate yet
[36:01.720 --> 36:04.760]  don't you worry there'll be a time for it will you think that time is coming i
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.240]  think the time is coming especially since obama got up uh... when he was
[36:08.240 --> 36:10.560]  elected president and said uh...
[36:10.560 --> 36:14.080]  that he's going to need us for a great service and sacrifice we're all going to
[36:14.080 --> 36:18.600]  be sacrificing and serving apparently boy yes so fox and friends here they are
[36:18.600 --> 36:20.600]  our best buddies
[36:20.600 --> 36:24.280]  seven minutes before the top of the hour can america's power last forever and
[36:24.280 --> 36:26.400]  how do we achieve a new nationalism
[36:26.400 --> 36:30.600]  that puts our country's survival first those questions and more are addressed
[36:30.600 --> 36:34.320]  in a brand new book by tony blankley comes out today is called american grant
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.880]  what will it take for america to survive and win
[36:37.880 --> 36:41.360]  in the twenty-first century and join us for his first interview about the book
[36:41.360 --> 36:44.040]  is tony blankley tony good morning to you
[36:44.040 --> 36:45.080]  good morning thank you
[36:45.080 --> 36:48.520]  uh... you know uh... if you read some of the european papers they're talking about
[36:48.520 --> 36:52.520]  uh... america is finally in decline they're getting what uh... they've had
[36:52.520 --> 36:56.000]  come into a mall along do you believe that
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.640]  well it could be so
[36:57.640 --> 37:01.640]  we have it in our power not to be in decline and that's what my books about
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.440]  i do believe that for the first time in our history if we don't do a lot of
[37:05.440 --> 37:07.040]  things smart and tough
[37:07.040 --> 37:10.920]  we could get overwhelmed by the rise of china the rise of india the rise of
[37:10.920 --> 37:14.560]  radical islam we failed to exploit our energy
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.280]  uh... we had to educate would not pay enough attention to what our kids are
[37:18.280 --> 37:21.480]  learning bill airs is actually a senior person
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.040]  in guiding the curriculum design of america that started just this last
[37:25.040 --> 37:25.920]  march
[37:25.920 --> 37:29.920]  so we are but we have it in our power right i try to write some tough
[37:29.920 --> 37:34.000]  proposals for what we need to do so that our grandchildren live in a country
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.480]  strong enough to protect our freedoms just as we do yet on your books can get a
[37:37.480 --> 37:41.960]  lot of attention because there are some controversial bold suggestions
[37:41.960 --> 37:44.880]  the first one obviously that caught my eye was that you're calling for a
[37:44.880 --> 37:46.600]  universal draft
[37:46.600 --> 37:49.360]  which would mean that all eighteen year olds in america
[37:49.360 --> 37:52.200]  would have to serve for two years
[37:52.200 --> 37:56.480]  yes look i don't like it i i i love the volunteer army i've got a son who's a
[37:56.480 --> 37:58.280]  second one
[37:58.280 --> 38:02.240]  i mean i know that the young men and women who serve their greatest
[38:02.240 --> 38:04.240]  young kids we we've ever produced
[38:04.240 --> 38:07.800]  but we don't have enough troops and it's manifest that we don't buy several
[38:07.800 --> 38:10.560]  magnitudes for instance when
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.520]  uh... george bush wanted to have the search he was told by the senior
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.440]  generals we didn't have the extra twenty thousand troops are a lot of war
[38:18.440 --> 38:21.640]  and i don't have enough troops i got a plan
[38:21.640 --> 38:23.960]  why don't we just get the heck out of there you know that they would have
[38:23.960 --> 38:27.360]  enough troops because i you know pakistan needs dealing with that's why
[38:27.360 --> 38:28.560]  biden was there
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.320]  all over the week we have to have a package and we got a mess around the
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.480]  art with the iranians whatever the israelis we have to create a eurasian
[38:36.480 --> 38:40.320]  union don't you understand that and rogue nations will not be allowed in
[38:40.320 --> 38:43.200]  the nation's not under the thumb of u.s
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.880]  dominance and really really are you really is a big neighbor's
[38:48.880 --> 38:49.960]  is a big new
[38:49.960 --> 38:54.000]  is the cause of all the time z big z big are you related to that guy maybe i
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.240]  mean i'm like his bastard child because you know his uh... his daughter is
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.640]  over on msnbc
[38:59.640 --> 39:02.160]  and then his son is a big uh... republican
[39:02.160 --> 39:05.200]  uh... you know that they got it all covered yet they got it all covered some
[39:05.200 --> 39:07.520]  on the alternative guy you're right yeah
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.440]  i was that didn't didn't see big work on the canes campaign in two thousand
[39:11.440 --> 39:15.120]  and i think he did yeah i'm pretty sure he switched over to uh...
[39:15.120 --> 39:18.680]  uh... well it's on worked in uh... well await on the mccain campaign he
[39:18.680 --> 39:21.320]  covers them all and he's got about they got it all figured out that you sound
[39:21.320 --> 39:24.000]  like z big in this american empire
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.960]  needs to be established until we can turn it all over to the u n that was a
[39:26.960 --> 39:30.080]  lot about the grand chess board and that's a grand chess board every the
[39:30.080 --> 39:34.080]  last part now well that that's what it says the last part says we must we must
[39:34.080 --> 39:38.080]  dominate the world with our hegemony until it's such a time at which we can
[39:38.080 --> 39:40.960]  turn it all over to the u n i mean it says in the back of the book well that's
[39:40.960 --> 39:43.560]  pretty much what it'll be a little probably uh... it won't be called the
[39:43.560 --> 39:47.360]  u n i'm sure they'll have some other global term for you on the smiley face
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.960]  whatever you know whatever i don't know alright let's take calls we promise you
[39:51.960 --> 39:53.200]  we take calls on
[39:53.200 --> 39:54.480]  all your issues

[40:37.680 --> 40:40.080]  lovely work you know for them is great
[40:40.080 --> 40:41.680]  thank you
[40:41.680 --> 40:44.920]  just uh... all you're doing a good job sitting in the file it's too uh... i
[40:44.920 --> 40:48.280]  always want to say you're fine uh... printed sunday you'll make a great
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.400]  job
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.200]  uh... i was looking at the uh... metallic video you brought up on uh... monday i
[40:56.200 --> 41:00.840]  think and i want to be into a deep analysis on it and i can't find out
[41:00.840 --> 41:04.520]  that uh... the soviet for the one that we're conducting the chemtrails in the
[41:04.520 --> 41:08.840]  metallic video they called the problem by introducing the spores that turned
[41:08.840 --> 41:12.760]  people into zombies yeah but i i hold on at the end if you if you watch that
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.120]  are there's the point where it's all the research in its real video and then it
[41:16.120 --> 41:20.760]  cuts to the cartoon uh... that the whole like zombie horror story it right
[41:20.760 --> 41:21.880]  united states
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.400]  alright so at the end when the soviet's want to come in their plan if you read
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.720]  the bottom thing is they say basically they're going to release the agent and
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.280]  then they're going to take days and fires are going to start and most everybody's
[41:33.280 --> 41:36.840]  going to get infected then they put up the chemtrails so they kill most of them
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.920]  then they bring in the robots yes and then they exactly that's their solution
[41:40.920 --> 41:44.680]  but what what you don't understand is that was their plan that they don't go
[41:44.680 --> 41:48.600]  through and then they cut to modern days and they start playing news clips of
[41:48.600 --> 41:53.000]  today of chemtrails in the air so what are these chemtrails ball it's not the
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.840]  soviet spray the chemtrails now it's the american spraying the chemtrails to
[41:56.840 --> 42:00.200]  make sure that the soviet's can't have their way so they're saying that the
[42:00.200 --> 42:04.360]  barium and arsenic in the chemtrails are what's protecting us from soviet
[42:04.360 --> 42:08.600]  attack is remember before they spray the chemtrails they see the clouds with
[42:08.600 --> 42:12.600]  that spore remember they drop those little bags of clouds so basically what
[42:12.600 --> 42:15.480]  they're trying to say is that the chemtrails are here to protect us that's
[42:15.480 --> 42:17.080]  what i got out of the video
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.320]  i kinda i kinda got a deeper look into it because i'm thinking that it's a new
[42:21.320 --> 42:24.520]  soviet nation that they're trying to impose
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.320]  basically they're gonna cause a problem hollywood's all over it i am legend
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.240]  resident evil it's everywhere the zombie thing is obviously something that's to
[42:33.240 --> 42:36.040]  come uh... we're going to have to go through some major
[42:36.040 --> 42:40.600]  uh... biological infection well they have been hyping it man
[42:40.600 --> 42:44.040]  yeah they have been hyping it i'm not gonna lie it's all about quarantine and
[42:44.040 --> 42:46.280]  control yeah well then you know what that that
[42:46.280 --> 42:49.720]  who knows i you know what i've watched it now like five times i thank you for the
[42:49.720 --> 42:53.160]  call and thank you for some positive on playing that metallica thing but if you
[42:53.160 --> 42:55.320]  haven't seen this this is what's causing all this
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.360]  this problem uh... metallica's latest video for uh... death magnetic it's their
[43:00.360 --> 43:04.200]  new album it's actually pretty good they started out with the tenguska event
[43:04.200 --> 43:06.600]  out in russia and you know it took like a year to uh...
[43:06.600 --> 43:10.040]  yeah this big explosion nobody knows what it is a year to excavate
[43:10.040 --> 43:13.400]  well it gets into eugenics apparently they excavate something that can
[43:13.400 --> 43:18.600]  reanimate life so they're reanimating a stake at first and then a cat next
[43:18.600 --> 43:21.320]  and then you know it gets out of control of the stake
[43:21.320 --> 43:26.760]  yeah yeah you gotta watch the video but it's always crazy it's just thought out
[43:26.760 --> 43:29.640]  yeah well it was dancing i don't think you can get dancing stake just thawing
[43:29.640 --> 43:32.840]  it out well unless it's really old okay
[43:32.840 --> 43:35.880]  but anyway anyway they they harness this thing
[43:35.880 --> 43:38.680]  you know at first they're using it to like cure cuts and things like that is
[43:38.680 --> 43:42.120]  regenerating cells but then it regenerates dead life and it's you know
[43:42.120 --> 43:45.000]  basically turns into a zombie horror show but then they bring in the chem
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.120]  trails at the end where the chem trails are basically
[43:48.120 --> 43:51.800]  the cure and they cut from the entire video and all the music video to start
[43:51.800 --> 43:55.640]  playing the latest conspiracy theory of all these news things about chem
[43:55.640 --> 43:57.720]  trails and basically the chem trails are made
[43:57.720 --> 44:00.920]  to be healthy for us so i think what i get i think i get the picture now it's
[44:00.920 --> 44:03.560]  the same old stuff where they take something that's really happening
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.720]  which is chem trails and put a bunch of zombie weird stuff on it to make
[44:07.720 --> 44:10.200]  everybody think is a joke yes okay i get it now
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.400]  yeah and a positive joke at that like yeah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[44:13.400 --> 44:16.760]  chem trails are good for you yes barium's good for you barium's good for you
[44:16.760 --> 44:20.200]  aluminum silicates and things that are arsenic delicious
[44:20.200 --> 44:23.960]  yeah all right let's keep taking calls let's go to ed in pennsylvania ed was on
[44:23.960 --> 44:25.440]  your mind
[44:25.440 --> 44:26.880]  a great show guys
[44:26.880 --> 44:28.200]  uh...
[44:28.200 --> 44:31.840]  but now it's back at that if you could take you out and uh... show you a little
[44:31.840 --> 44:34.560]  bit of rifles and how to shoot
[44:34.560 --> 44:35.500]  stuff because uh...
[44:35.500 --> 44:37.440]  you seem like a really nice guy but
[44:37.440 --> 44:41.200]  uh... little really naive when it comes to high-powered rifles and what
[44:41.200 --> 44:43.600]  yeah i'm not a good guy doing the future here
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.040]  well you know all right let me let me take that i'm a federal forums licensee
[44:47.040 --> 44:50.640]  my friend i know a little bit about guns and i know that you do bob it
[44:50.640 --> 44:53.680]  are asking you know you're you're somewhat of a gun enthusiast rate right
[44:53.680 --> 44:57.360]  right mostly mostly handguns but what was the question basically a lot of
[44:57.360 --> 45:01.040]  these people think that you know we're going to have to you know face off against
[45:01.040 --> 45:04.560]  these guys in some type of uh... militia type army now i'm not saying that
[45:04.560 --> 45:07.040]  there might not come an event when someone's trying to take your home
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.280]  when there's riots in the street when you might have to protect your family
[45:10.280 --> 45:12.800]  and that sort of thing but if we ever have to go toe to toe
[45:12.800 --> 45:14.960]  with the police force of the military
[45:14.960 --> 45:18.920]  on a large-scale level i'm sorry we don't have a shot well you know that's a
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.360]  little that's the the last resort that's what the second amendment is
[45:22.360 --> 45:25.040]  there for a solution for it's a last resort
[45:25.040 --> 45:28.360]  i i i got a kind of understand what he's saying in that
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.720]  you can take something like the uh... soviet military in the going to afghanistan
[45:31.720 --> 45:34.520]  and get their tails kicked
[45:34.520 --> 45:35.600]  abab a bunch of
[45:35.600 --> 45:36.840]  go-toddlers
[45:36.840 --> 45:39.400]  because of the
[45:39.400 --> 45:42.720]  just the people rebelling against the foreign invader or whatever they're
[45:42.720 --> 45:43.920]  going to kick them out
[45:43.920 --> 45:46.400]  you know they can't control the population
[45:46.400 --> 45:47.240]  uh...
[45:47.240 --> 45:50.800]  that's what the second amendment is about interest in re in regard to foreigners
[45:50.800 --> 45:51.880]  invading us
[45:51.880 --> 45:52.920]  the thing about it
[45:52.920 --> 45:57.360]  our own selves invading us basically when when our government turns on us
[45:57.360 --> 46:00.080]  that's a that's a much more difficult thing
[46:00.080 --> 46:03.360]  the fight and that's why you know we're having jack mclean monitor on today
[46:03.360 --> 46:06.480]  because he knows all about that and that's right and we do give a voice to
[46:06.480 --> 46:09.840]  those people that think it will come to that you do you don't want to come to
[46:09.840 --> 46:12.440]  that at all at all but i'll tell you something
[46:12.440 --> 46:16.120]  uh... you know i in my hardware store i have a little small gun department it's
[46:16.120 --> 46:18.960]  really no big deal it's just a small department
[46:18.960 --> 46:21.240]  buddy in my my store was a was a
[46:21.240 --> 46:24.880]  uh... mirror to what happened all over the country just before obama got elected
[46:24.880 --> 46:27.480]  a big light bulb went off in everybody's head
[46:27.480 --> 46:31.040]  and all the sudden gun sales started to skyrocket
[46:31.040 --> 46:32.320]  uh... i mean if you talk
[46:32.320 --> 46:35.360]  because they know i i've seen the legislation that's been introduced over
[46:35.360 --> 46:38.040]  and over and over again with the democrats didn't control the house in the
[46:38.040 --> 46:38.920]  senate
[46:38.920 --> 46:42.120]  you know they're going after uh... they're going after ammunition
[46:42.120 --> 46:44.600]  they're going after semi-automatic rifles first
[46:44.600 --> 46:46.400]  and obama says has said it
[46:46.400 --> 46:49.480]  and they're going after semi-auto so everything semi-automatic in this
[46:49.480 --> 46:50.760]  country
[46:50.760 --> 46:52.960]  uh... a k-type semi-autos
[46:52.960 --> 46:54.320]  air fifteen's
[46:54.320 --> 46:56.560]  and in the handgun category glocks
[46:56.560 --> 46:57.640]  that type of thing
[46:57.640 --> 47:01.000]  they're evaporating off the shelves and and and the production can't keep up with
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.400]  the demand so people are clearly
[47:03.400 --> 47:05.280]  clearly worried
[47:05.280 --> 47:08.520]  about what this latest puppet is going to do that to attack the second
[47:08.520 --> 47:09.120]  amendment
[47:09.120 --> 47:13.200]  after he puts his hand on the bobble and swears to protect it
[47:13.200 --> 47:19.080]  can agree more i let's go to mark in kentucky mark what's on your mind
[47:19.080 --> 47:21.440]  yes mark i want to uh...
[47:21.440 --> 47:24.680]  kind of go the middle line here i don't think you're really softy
[47:24.680 --> 47:25.720]  but uh...
[47:25.720 --> 47:29.600]  uh... language is a real tricky thing and when you say that we just can't uh...
[47:29.600 --> 47:32.360]  defeat them in the and in that uh... level
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.880]  it kind of paint the of visualization picture in that strong psychology force
[47:36.880 --> 47:38.120]  you would not
[47:38.120 --> 47:41.400]  be sitting in that chair doing that today if you were a defeatist
[47:41.400 --> 47:44.920]  i don't know i'm not a defeatist i don't know that i agree there but i'm
[47:44.920 --> 47:46.000]  saying all right
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.400]  let's say
[47:47.400 --> 47:51.320]  let's say it's already happening we got martial law they've taken uh...
[47:51.320 --> 47:54.600]  not only national guard troops but probably nato forces because you know
[47:54.600 --> 47:57.560]  it american troops are gonna have a hard time shooting other america's but
[47:57.560 --> 48:00.560]  they bring in nato forces and they're working with the local police
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.400]  and local service department i just don't see us being able to art
[48:05.400 --> 48:06.680]  and they say oh my god
[48:06.680 --> 48:09.080]  they've got three hundred real regimented
[48:09.080 --> 48:11.720]  uh... militia types they're all very well-armed
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.120]  uh... they've got positions
[48:13.120 --> 48:16.040]  they're not sending those people and they're going to send drones in man they're
[48:16.040 --> 48:18.680]  going to have a little major and that's a problem
[48:18.680 --> 48:21.120]  you're doing great on the disclaimers
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.520]  uh... we have to be cautious when we step up to the plate
[48:24.520 --> 48:28.880]  i have to understand what's coming at us this tony blakley is driving me nuts
[48:28.880 --> 48:31.920]  i'd i hope nobody buys a suckers book
[48:31.920 --> 48:35.280]  i bet you it's a new york times number one bestseller i'll put money on the
[48:35.280 --> 48:40.040]  his army is not big enough to do what's required of it by
[48:40.040 --> 48:45.600]  by who is who is required and it's crazy and what is being required who what
[48:45.600 --> 48:48.640]  is the requirement what is that he didn't define the requirement i mean
[48:48.640 --> 48:50.200]  they're bringing these guys home
[48:50.200 --> 48:52.120]  that thirty thousand of them or so
[48:52.120 --> 48:54.160]  at it what what they call that uh...
[48:54.160 --> 48:58.040]  the north com whatever uh... local north
[48:58.040 --> 49:00.680]  i don't know what to call it that will they brought in four thousand troops
[49:00.680 --> 49:03.800]  and that's up to thirty thousand for domestic law enforcement all you're
[49:03.800 --> 49:06.280]  talking about that the new obama program where they're it's going to be
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.560]  domestic law enforcement as twenty i believe it's twenty thousand troops
[49:09.560 --> 49:12.440]  and you know it's i mean that's totally illegal i mean it's completely and
[49:12.440 --> 49:15.440]  totally illegal they ended positive comment on this really in the in the
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.040]  public size with katrina when they put it's on the streets to take guns
[49:19.040 --> 49:21.960]  there i mean i say they did but they didn't
[49:21.960 --> 49:24.000]  they didn't do it legally no status
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.960]  and people could look up that's a route to go but uh...
[49:26.960 --> 49:30.400]  uh... you did give some excellent information yesterday i guess it was
[49:30.400 --> 49:33.000]  mike uh... said so that uh...
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.280]  when you get in there in the adduction center
[49:35.280 --> 49:39.240]  they still have to get you to swear an oath and step forward
[49:39.240 --> 49:41.720]  and yeah they may be the hell out of you
[49:41.720 --> 49:46.560]  but i i think that this is a challenge that we may raise to what if i have to
[49:46.560 --> 49:49.680]  people that they're taking into these induction centers don't
[49:49.680 --> 49:52.640]  play ball and don't step forward and say yeah i would
[49:52.640 --> 49:56.840]  i would defend my country but you are a trader get me to do what you're expecting
[49:56.840 --> 50:00.960]  me to do and they you know they they're going to run out of resources if if the
[50:00.960 --> 50:02.800]  masses say no
[50:02.800 --> 50:05.680]  well i don't think it's the court
[50:05.680 --> 50:09.520]  but uh... in mass you know it's like uh... save a patriot always talking
[50:09.520 --> 50:11.680]  about you have one pencil you can break it
[50:11.680 --> 50:15.000]  well you know i think he's going to be a recruiters for it ain't gonna break
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.360]  this is how they're gonna listen this is that how they're gonna recruit their
[50:17.360 --> 50:18.200]  force
[50:18.200 --> 50:21.000]  uh... they're going to go into the poor black neighborhoods
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.160]  they're gonna prop obama up as a hero and that's where they're gonna recruit
[50:24.160 --> 50:27.440]  from first and that's probably gonna be the first place they draft from
[50:27.440 --> 50:29.840]  because these guys are going to be brainwashed into it
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.160]  i mean he's already being posed as some kind of a martin luther king jr figure
[50:34.160 --> 50:36.720]  i know we're not gonna talk we gotta talk
[50:36.720 --> 50:40.240]  positive visualization and not with the negative

[54:54.560 --> 54:58.400]  in my stack the one that the mainstream media is reporting on
[54:58.400 --> 55:01.280]  miracle baby born two days after mother's death
[55:01.280 --> 55:08.160]  and this does you know warm a heart or two miracles of science
[55:08.160 --> 55:11.440]  this woman just collapsed of course she had a
[55:11.440 --> 55:14.400]  cancerous brain term we should didn't know about vaccinations
[55:14.400 --> 55:18.800]  um you know a young lady what was she was even 40
[55:18.800 --> 55:22.320]  if she was 41 years old and she had this brain tumor she didn't know about
[55:22.320 --> 55:26.000]  she she collapsed and died but they were able to save the baby
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.680]  and two days after she died and they kept her heart going uh she was born
[55:31.680 --> 55:34.960]  so there's a there's an upbeat story there's something that's positive
[55:34.960 --> 55:38.240]  technology you're uh you're a little you don't know
[55:38.240 --> 55:42.000]  just you know the thing i wonder about that is you know why did you why she
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.360]  got cancer in the first place yeah you know you know the big industry
[55:45.360 --> 55:49.520]  uh yeah well that's the thing it's a it's a huge huge industry you know
[55:49.520 --> 55:52.880]  on on our on our show the simple truth here in austin
[55:52.880 --> 55:56.560]  you have a website now called symbol truth online dot net
[55:56.560 --> 56:00.160]  and uh the webmaster uh archives our old shows
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.080]  and the one that we did with about cancer a few years ago which we replayed so we
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.840]  can get it on the net uh that that one keeps being
[56:07.840 --> 56:11.760]  disappeared off the net we we put it up twice
[56:11.760 --> 56:16.240]  something happens to it we we put it up again something happens to it again and
[56:16.240 --> 56:18.960]  we put it up again i mean the cancer show
[56:18.960 --> 56:22.720]  something's going on there and they don't want it they don't want that
[56:22.720 --> 56:25.680]  information out there that there are cures for cancer wonder why
[56:25.680 --> 56:30.240]  uh maybe big pharma would lose billions of dollars in profits maybe i could
[56:30.240 --> 56:33.120]  and it wouldn't go along with their depopulation program it's not really a
[56:33.120 --> 56:36.800]  depopulation program it's a slow kill program to try to stop the expansion of
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.080]  the population yeah i mean you know cancer is is rampant
[56:40.080 --> 56:44.160]  and the cancer industry is a joke unless of course you get cancer in which case
[56:44.160 --> 56:48.160]  the joke's on you right yeah it's not very funny when you're the one laid up

[1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:58.240]  really ran some interviews we did back a few years ago
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:02.720]  what was called the shannon simpson story uh and this was a lady that we
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:07.200]  flew in from louisiana to interview back in 2003
[1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:11.280]  and her story basically is that she was 20 years old
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:15.680]  uh co-ed here here in here in the austin area at southwestern university
[1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.240]  and she had all these problems he couldn't figure out what it was so he did
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:22.160]  an operation exploratory operation and they found cancer all over just
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.000]  everywhere so they did a they did a operation took out everything they
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.040]  could take out you know they sold okay it's time for your chemo you know
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:33.200]  this is back in 1983 she refused her parents refused
[1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:37.760]  uh and she um uh because she had read world without cancer by jibra griffin
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:40.320]  they had read the book they weren't going to do the
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:43.440]  the butchery stuff that you know the poison and all that
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:47.680]  irradiation burning and poisoning that the that the mainstream
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:51.680]  uh medicines as you got to do and so uh she uh went to mexico
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:55.680]  and was was cured of cancer with the leitro therapy by
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:59.200]  dr richardson who was a leitro pioneer in the 70s
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:03.520]  he'd been kicked out of the united states set up a clinic in in mexico
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:06.560]  well he was featured in in jibra griffin's book
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:12.160]  okay so uh that was that was in 1983 well we interviewed her in 2003
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:17.840]  20 years later and uh here's a deal i know this woman

[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:29.760]  gun nuts up there as we got you think not but you know that's only because they
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:33.200]  won't let them have the handguns otherwise i know plenty of people with
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:37.280]  their cases stock full of shotguns and rifles man
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:40.560]  yeah but that's like sporting stuff well because you can't have a handgun

[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:22.240]  oh no way around it my friend um i i you know ahead of
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:25.680]  recently brought up that uh david ray griffin um
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.880]  has been talking about world government what do you feel about that
[1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:33.120]  sure you know david is one of those guys that you know he's not the only one in
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:36.240]  this movement that talks about world democracy and world government i've
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:39.440]  been david's home and i've discussed the same subject with
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:42.960]  many people behind the scenes and you know there are just some people again
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:45.280]  that have their blind spots they really believe that
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:49.360]  you know world government is good they think that worldwide democracy is good
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:52.720]  and i mean you know he does great work on nine eleven
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:56.640]  but you gotta remember he's a theosophical professor so he's not only
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:59.920]  even though he comes at it from a christian perspective he looks at all
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:02.320]  separate religions he's a strong believer
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:05.360]  that we do need some kind of a world religion as well
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:08.400]  i just happened to disagree with him on that point i mean
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:12.000]  you know i've had i remember you alex had him on years ago and even a caller
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.960]  called in and confronted him on it you know it's just his viewpoint there's a
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.400]  lot of people out there that really you know look at the zeitgeist guy i mean
[1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:21.440]  a lot of guys talks about in the first half of his
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:25.520]  addendum movie is dead on those technologies do exist the banking system
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:28.880]  is that corrupt it's when they offer you the solution of world
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:32.160]  government you know are they all in cahoots in a back room saying that we
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:35.600]  have to you know promote this through nine eleven truth or
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:39.360]  through the banking collapse i don't know i doubt it i think that people have
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:42.160]  just been so brainwashed into believing it's a good thing
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:46.160]  from not only their schooling but just everything around them has promoted it
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:49.600]  from the media to movies right i mean you even have children at the you know
[1:11:49.600 --> 1:11:53.360]  the model u n in their school yeah well that's in uh... what america
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:56.480]  destroyed by design one alex's first pictures he goes to
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:00.240]  the model u n where i think two kids from each school district or
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:03.760]  are chosen and they go off to this little indoctrination center for a month
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:09.040]  or uh... you know a week and uh... find out how great global government is
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:11.760]  and it's a you know it'd be funny if it wasn't true
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:16.320]  and uh... you know it yeah again you know you know it's so hard to take a
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:20.240]  step to where you just can't laugh at it because it's just right in your face
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:23.520]  i mean what do they think we are well just because you you
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:26.880]  can smell a rat with nine one one doesn't mean you've been exposed all the
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:28.960]  information that we've been exposed to
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.040]  you know right it's it's hard to get out of that that left right
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:37.200]  paradigm in the government yesterday i mean you're a mcgovern is giving the
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:39.760]  obama administration way too much credit i mean
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:43.040]  mcgovern at this point knows that there's no change gates is still in or
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:46.560]  mcgovern at this point knows that ron manuel is a bad pick
[1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:50.080]  i mean he can't be feeling good about that presidency but at the same time
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:53.040]  the the left doesn't feel like they have anything to cling on to they feel if
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:56.320]  they go too far to the left they're a communist or a socialist
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.960]  and if they ditch their party where they're gonna go
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.560]  they are green it's like we're all we all have our spheres of influence or
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:05.440]  our little circles that we believe in and they kind of intersect
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:08.720]  like i don't understand i've never understood what michael revero
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:12.240]  kind of defended obama for so long i had him on i never understood that i
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:14.880]  don't i say he's he knows a lot of stuff yet he
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:19.040]  he kind of defended obama and i mean he recanted a lot of that yesterday
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:22.240]  well you know it's like okay you're gonna wake up a little bit more you know
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:26.000]  revero was great what really happened dot com fantastic website i go there
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.040]  every day but i was always like why are you
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.120]  defending this guy i mean and he was one of the guys that actually said that the
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:39.440]  the birth certificate wasn't valid but you know he uh two days ago on his show
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:42.560]  he said that the administration was already disappointing to him
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:45.600]  we already talked already it's not even going yet it's not even going yet but we
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:48.160]  talked about ron manuel we talked about gates so
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:51.040]  you know i think that he's getting around his blind spot look at american
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:54.560]  drug war you know kevin booth he's a great filmmaker he's the guy that used
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:58.320]  to manage bill hicks he's seen he seems to still have his blind spots too he
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:02.480]  worked on um i think it was american dictators he added that film one of my
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:05.200]  favorite alex jones films he has his blind spots
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:09.040]  yeah you know we all have our blind spots man uh david rey griffin
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:12.480]  you know that he's not perfect on nine eleven either you know no one is perfect
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:15.440]  we're all human beings i encourage people to just go check out everybody's

[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:29.920]  and people need to start realizing that they need to fight for this truth and
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:33.040]  figure it out for themselves i'm with you a hundred percent thank you for the

[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:55.120]  the process that i think like the process takes about a week to
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:59.040]  say whether or not you can have that handgun but i can't take it anywhere
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:03.200]  i can have it in my house yeah you can take it out to the range in practice

[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:08.400]  okay the militia okay you you need to read
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:12.640]  article one section eight clause fifteen and sixteen
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:16.640]  section article two section two about the militia
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:20.800]  and tie it in with the second amendment the best way to do this is to read
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:23.760]  dr edwin vierer's articles on the militia
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:27.760]  he outlines it all the militia is not
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:31.840]  uh... what what it's been made out to be it's the people's
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:37.040]  law enforcement agency that's what it's there for
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:40.240]  the people got to get away from the uh...
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:44.160]  and excuse me right wing uh... militia
[1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:47.600]  mentality and see what it's all about well i mean there's a lot of great
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:50.720]  groups out there that are trying to put together a well-formed militias that
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:53.360]  aren't right wing that aren't you know that it
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:57.040]  are organized and and can't be demonized
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:00.240]  but that's not actually revitalizing the militia
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:04.720]  through state the state has a militia act and that needs to be
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:09.040]  reinforced so that it is a law enforcement agency
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:11.840]  that's that's what we're talking about here do you think they're ever really
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:14.080]  going to put that much power in the people's hands again
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:16.880]  i mean i'm just looking at a realistic point of view i mean
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:20.000]  you're in jersey i mean how many of your friends are awakened aware i mean do you
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.480]  go and shoot with your buddies do you have just a small well
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:26.240]  i don't shoot with judges and lawyers well that's good i used to
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:31.200]  on a regular basis but are they awake or are these just your buddies because
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.680]  you know you've known them for a long time some of them
[1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:37.360]  some of them are but it's it's hard to press the point
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:42.160]  on what the uh... lawful tools are to get around all the corruption
[1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:46.640]  uh... you guys familiar with the uh... the book the soprano state
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:49.760]  no all right well it's about all the corruption
[1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:53.120]  uh... in new jersey and it'd be uh... we'd be aren't pressed
[1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:57.520]  to get it done here but states like montana and i believe oklahoma are
[1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:00.960]  starting to uh... uh... press the issue for uh...
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:04.880]  revitalizing the militia so i get done somewhere in this country
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:07.840]  well that'd be nice i feel like if that does happen those states will
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:10.320]  immediately be demonized i think that's why
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:13.760]  you saw them demonize uh... the militia movement in ninety three with oklahoma
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:16.800]  i'm sorry ninety five with the oklahoma city bombing
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:21.360]  you know they needed to make these guys look violent and that's exactly what
[1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:24.960]  they did and really in the mainstream they've been demonized since then that
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:27.280]  whole militia movement in the main line
[1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:32.000]  oh you're one of those right wing cooks i'm not applauding i think it's deplorable
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:35.520]  but it's a lot of guys in the militia have actually
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:40.000]  fostered that problem themselves i mean we're seeing a video of
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:44.160]  some militia groups and this is our fifty caliber right here taking out
[1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.960]  good buddy and he's all you know it's like okay
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:50.000]  whatever if they they help the process along
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.200]  uh... a lot of them with their actions well a lot of them are provocative toward
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:56.480]  into that too a lot of these guys head up these things are really fb i
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:18:58.960]  that's true you know that's unfortunate but true
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:04.720]  all right let's jump to vicky in idaho vicky what's on your mind
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:10.800]  yes can you hear me yes yes i'm just a mom got two kids in the draft age and
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:15.920]  i'm just sick of convening i didn't vote for obama or mccain
[1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:19.200]  and i'm just feel like people just aren't
[1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:22.640]  really seeing what's on the table they need cannon fodder to fight another
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:24.480]  war in iran and they
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:27.200]  well i don't even know if we're gonna go into iran but definitely into the
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:30.400]  middle east what again what they're doing i mean openly right now
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:33.040]  obama is talking about redistribution of troops
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:37.040]  into afghanistan okay and now this de-escalation in iraq is just going to
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:40.800]  bring those troops there now we already have some kind of issue with pakistan
[1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:44.320]  and india right now where the isi is helping these
[1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:48.800]  militant attacks so i i you know maybe pakistan's on the table forget about
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:51.840]  iran right now but in your kids may be drafted to go to the middle east

[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.600]  you know mousseline type fascist movement but they have read i mean
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:13.520]  on the cover of the rolling stone man they had him basically he was god he
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:17.840]  was deified he was glowing he was in the clouds he's the chosen one
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:21.760]  now he's on the cover of a special edition of newsweek
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:25.440]  where it says the new global elite and it's got all sorts of weird symbolism
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:28.800]  on it uh... it's it's very disturbing how how much
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:31.280]  this guy's been pushed and how much his agenda
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:34.800]  is just a continuation of the globalist policies we've seen
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:38.560]  throughout the clinton and bush administrations national service is a
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:42.080]  it comes straight out of the u n yeah it's straight out of the u n they say
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:46.240]  oh you your your rights can only be achieved if you realize you have
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:49.920]  certain responsibilities to your to your state
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:53.520]  and that is so in american it's not even funny national service i don't care
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.880]  what is hitler mousseline or or obama
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:00.960]  sucks yeah it's it's uh... they're supposed to serve us we're not supposed
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:04.960]  to serve them we're the sovereign they're supposed to be
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:07.600]  doing our bidding it's not supposed to be the other way around the government
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:10.960]  foreign by the people it's not really like that though yeah well i'm i'm sorry
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  when you this is all straight out of the u n universal declaration of human

[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:40.240]  calling for our outright revolution but uh...
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:44.160]  i just have a problem i'm sad i've been listening to show up in a fan for a while
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:50.240]  mm-hmm and i hear that my government you know is uh... stealing my money
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:54.880]  they're giving me vaccines and to my babies that are going to kill them
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:58.560]  mm-hmm uh... they're poisoning the food

[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:13.440]  conflict you know we're gonna get wiped out i mean what if george washington
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:16.800]  had that attitude i don't know if we're so much going to get wiped out i think
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:18.800]  that honestly we're going to get hurted up
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:22.560]  i mean most listen most people right here's an article out of us cnn health
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:25.600]  dot com this is out today why so many minds think alike
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:28.720]  you're in a room with ten other people who seem to agree on something but you
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:32.240]  hold the opposite view do you say something or you just go along with
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:35.120]  the others most people will just go along with the others by the way i agree
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:38.640]  with that well on decades of research show people tend to go along with the
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:42.720]  majority view even if that view is objectively incorrect now scientists
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:45.440]  are supporting those theories with brain images
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:49.120]  i'll just stop the article there they're hiring at a massive rate for the
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:50.160]  religious people
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:53.600]  they're hiring the preachers to tell them to go to the camps most people are
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:56.560]  going to go to the god damn camps excuse my french
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:28:00.560]  and it sucks and then you're gonna have a leftover few that want to battle it
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.680]  out well i'm sorry man they're not going to take you to four they're not going

[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:16.160]  want to blame for all this but are you ever going to get close to the guys
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:19.680]  that actually run the show no and if you ever put yourself in a position
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:23.920]  where you're with dozens or hundreds of other peoples it's drone city

[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:51.200]  but then but then what's the answer i mean okay we've got
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:55.120]  say you got 30 million people in this country that are ready to pull their
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:00.480]  hair out and storm a building but you know what what is the ultimate answer
[1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:03.600]  all right well i'll tell you what if we had 30 million people i hope three out
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:07.760]  of that 30 million would join me in a peaceful march in dc or new york city
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:11.120]  for the right causes but we haven't been able to do that first of all we have not

[1:30:29.600 --> 1:30:33.440]  the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:36.880]  that accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis

[1:33:18.400 --> 1:33:22.240]  very clear that i am not telling you to lay down your weapons i am not telling
[1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:26.000]  you to turn in your guns i am a pro second amendment guy i just don't
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:29.840]  think that we've been able to show ourselves as a
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:33.280]  you know peaceful group in masses you know that the movements that i've seen
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:37.120]  work and i don't think that they had all the solutions then our movements like
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:40.400]  the movement that gondi put out there for his people
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:44.160]  and the civil rights movement that you know was hijacked and a lot of leaders
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:48.240]  there were killed but eventually you know marlin their king's
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:51.680]  dream has been achieved there's a quality in this country you know there's
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:55.200]  still a little bit of racism here in there and you know they're still racist
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:57.760]  like the guy who called in yesterday about the race war
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:01.840]  yeah but for the most part you know if you're a black man or a black woman in
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:05.200]  this country you can achieve anything a white man can if you work hard enough
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:08.880]  and that's something that you know he did with sit-ins he did with people on the
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:11.440]  street handing out five that's why i like we are change
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:15.200]  i mean there's an organization that i feel john is just not big enough that
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:17.360]  people need to join that organization if we had
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:21.200]  you know another hundred we are change chapters pop up in this country would be
[1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:24.080]  a tremendous difference face and i think the thing that that is
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:27.920]  dictating why we haven't achieved these huge crowds
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:32.240]  is because uh we see what's going on and we see what they're planning we can
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:35.600]  prove it 16 different ways to sunday the the
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:38.960]  i'd say it's a problem but the problem is the average american
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:42.400]  doesn't perceive that his ox has been gored enough
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.720]  you know they don't they don't get it yet they don't it's not personal to them
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:52.560]  and unfortunately uh it's going to get personal to them and a positive
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:56.240]  offshoot of that may be that we will get the big numbers
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:00.000]  to do what we're talking about because you're right civil disobedience
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:07.920]  uh peaceful civil disobedience works and you go to the guns last last last
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:11.680]  last last resort that's not what we want nobody wants that
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:14.960]  you have no idea how ugly that would be you know it's not like you watch it on
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:18.240]  tv and can turn it off it's in a movie no it's not a movie it is
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:22.080]  it is 16 kinds of horrible that's the last thing you want
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:25.520]  and so the civil disobedience thing is so important and and
[1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:30.080]  as an interim thing when we were going to get officer jack mclean on here at 130
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:34.480]  uh yes his his deal is absolutely brilliant
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:37.680]  his deal is to wake up the military and the police
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:41.280]  so they know what's going on and mark dice of uh the resistance manifested to
[1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:44.400]  the similar thing mailing the troops right truth videos and books
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:47.680]  educate the troops in the constitution the bill rights what's
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.400]  going on educate the police because if they refuse
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:56.480]  to uh stomp on us guess what we don't get stomped on
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.720]  that's it yeah exactly let's let's put it out right now let's have operation
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:04.880]  uh send the troops dvds and dvd players you can go get a div x dvd player
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:09.200]  right now for 40 bucks at any retail store go get a thing of dvds you can
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:12.560]  burn all of our movies on the disc you cannot honestly now burn
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.320]  about five or six movies on the one disc you can send them to the troops
[1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:19.360]  and educate them all right we're gonna go back to john in utah what do you think
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:24.400]  john is he still here i like exactly what you guys are talking about
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:27.760]  and you know i wasn't saying that jason that you're saying to lay down your
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:31.600]  arms i mean i i know you don't believe that but
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:36.240]  but the thing for me is people seem to forget you know i probably because we
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:42.480]  weren't taught very well in school that in 1776
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:46.960]  you know our country was born because some guys started shooting military in
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:49.680]  the streets but you gotta remember the military in
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:52.160]  the streets had similar weapons at the time
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:55.680]  then the as the people i mean we we were outnumbered
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:58.640]  you know seven ways from sunday in that war too and we ended up winning but we
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:03.600]  had the same type of weapons we don't have to say we had better
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:08.880]  uh weapons uh the the british used a smooth bore brown best musket and they
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:11.920]  shot in the general direction and hope they hit something and a lot of our
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:15.280]  guys uh used rifles yeah and but it's not that way
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:18.880]  today you know we don't have the tanks and the military personnel that you know
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:21.920]  i get a lot of military to get at me on my space by the way john i thank you for
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:23.760]  the call and i thank you for bringing up that point
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.200]  and you know they're behind me a hundred percent um we had a military guy
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:31.600]  calling from germany yesterday the thing is you know most of these guys that
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:34.240]  are smart and know what's going on there in the military ain't going to be
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:37.520]  deployed here they're going to deploy u n troops
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:42.000]  mexican troops you know the biggest recruitment station i think around is in
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.400]  mexico i think i mean you go through i've seen
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:51.200]  what uh the cfr uh guy who writes for the new york times
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:55.440]  i can't i'm having a mind block on him he's far from new york times yeah he's
[1:37:55.440 --> 1:38:01.280]  uh crowd hammer okay this guy a few years ago was writing how great it was to
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:06.880]  sit there and recruit basically a mercenary army from from mexico you know
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:10.160]  say hey if you'll serve in the u.s army what you can't speak in this we don't
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:13.360]  care will that'll be how your path to citizenship
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:17.680]  and he was saying what a great idea it was i mean that is insane
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.200]  completely insane you know just what we need hessians
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:24.400]  you know forget what language they speak you know
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:28.960]  that we don't need any hessians sorry you know if if we would do it ron paul says
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:33.120]  mind our own business uh you know defend our shores uh and stop sticking our
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:36.480]  nose in everybody else's business and and stirring up enemies all over the
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:39.040]  place we wouldn't need a big army i don't agree
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:42.320]  i agree also we need is a force to keep us safe here
[1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:47.040]  at home and that's not protectionism either no or isolationist or isolationist
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:50.160]  a lot of people say oh you're an isolationist no i just feel like we
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:51.920]  should have our own sovereign nation and we can
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:56.800]  interdeal with other nations based upon those nations yeah exactly you know if
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:00.320]  someone threatens us legitimately okay well we'll see what we'll take care of
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:04.240]  business but but sit down we run around looking for trouble we have an
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:08.000]  expansionist policy let's be honest you sit the cia runs around

[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:41.760]  is pretty savvy he's you know obviously talked about
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:46.080]  do you see the uh... clip with uh... john king from cnn no he's got john king
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:51.600]  on cnn anchor for ten plus years and he's like you know congratulations on you
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:55.280]  in the media for getting uh... obama elected he makes that good point about
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:59.280]  the media i i chugged a little bit and then john king you know said oh well if
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:02.880]  your point is that obama is in for a new world order well then i think you're
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:04.560]  correct
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:11.120]  yeah so little inside joke little inside jokerino all right let's go to td in
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:15.120]  california td what's on your mind i don't know i'm a big fan of yours jason
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:17.600]  yours and alex if you guys rock
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:20.880]  um... i got a question about labeled enemies sure thing
[1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:24.000]  and let me set this up uh... i like to watch planes cuz
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:27.920]  i like them they're nice and uh... i like watching home videos of planes as
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:31.760]  well and one thing i've noticed is that in any light condition you know shadow
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:33.040]  or whatever
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:36.880]  uh... plane retains its color and one thing i've noticed about the fable
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:39.680]  dynamism uh... video is that uh...
[1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:44.560]  the nine eleven footage the plane in the nine eleven footage does not match
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:48.000]  the planes that you give examples of now i'm wondering
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.800]  why is it or i'm under actually i'm wondering what color is the plane in
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:56.400]  the nine eleven footage because we're talking about we're talking about the
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:58.960]  white planes in the nine eleven footage are we talking about the ones that the
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:41:59.840]  towers
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:02.960]  the one that the towers all right well here's what i've always said i thank
[1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:05.920]  you for the call because you know a lot of people with ripple effect
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:09.680]  and all this video footage is there a pot on the bottom of the plane
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:13.440]  you know all this other stuff first of all the first plane that was supposed
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:17.520]  to hit was an american airlines jet okay we only have one real video of that the
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:21.600]  nonday brothers footage and then we also have uh... another
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:25.440]  you know side footage of the explosion no other real video of the first plane
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:28.400]  so that one's kind of off the table on what it is you don't get a really good
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:31.120]  look at it you can't really see any marks on it now
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:35.760]  the second plane the hits the tower is a supposedly a united airlines plane now
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:38.800]  in several of the videos you can see the u a logo
[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:42.480]  on the back of the plane you can see it in the long shot that where it hits you
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:45.600]  can see the u a logo you can see in the up close shot
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:48.720]  where comes in color scheme on the definitely yeah yeah
[1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:51.440]  well the car scheme on the bottom plane is what gets me you're supposed to have
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:54.720]  this blue underside and two big blue engines right
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:59.760]  now when you see the uh... famous cnn footage when you see any amateur footage
[1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:03.120]  of the underside of the plane you don't see that it looks like a large gray
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:06.000]  plane you don't see any difference between the sides
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:11.280]  the bottom and the engine cell if any anomalies exist
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:14.400]  whatsoever with the plane i think that that's the one to point to physically i
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:16.480]  don't know about the pods i don't know
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:19.680]  you know the flashes are there but god knows what they are
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:23.120]  um i am a firm believer that i don't believe that the
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.880]  four plans that they say that were hijacked that were you know that had
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:29.360]  these passengers on them were the ones that hit the buildings
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:33.120]  you can listen to the the uh... norad conversations that morning
[1:43:33.120 --> 1:43:36.400]  they're very confused they're talking about blips on radar they actually
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:41.280]  think the united uh... airlines eleven is still in the air forty five minutes
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:44.240]  after it's hidden the uh... first hour
[1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:47.440]  so you know there's all sorts of scrambles they they track hijacks out of
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:50.720]  canada and alaska throughout the day uh... at one point they think that
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:53.440]  delton nineteen eighty nine has a bomb on board
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:57.280]  so is there a possibility that they sub some of these planes in absolutely
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:01.040]  and am i sure about it no so there you go
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:05.440]  all right let's go to matt in wisconsin matt what's on your mind
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:10.000]  hey jason how's it going good man hey first of all um thanks for all your
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:13.440]  work on the show and of course in the documentaries
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:17.600]  um... first-time college so i want to know jose jones and one peter joe's
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:21.040]  for all their work as well i really appreciate what you guys are doing
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:24.480]  uh... i can emphasize with the last call from new york i'm in oakland wisconsin
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:26.880]  the wind chills as well as twenty below zero today
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:30.400]  uh... that's why it's sustained cold snap over a decade
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:33.520]  wow it's ironic because the reason i'm calling you guys today is because of
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:37.520]  something i heard in last night and keith oberman show i don't remember who
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:41.440]  he was referring to but the guy he was talking about was referred to as a
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:44.960]  climate change denier i don't mind
[1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:48.480]  because i've heard the term holocaust and i used more and more frequently in
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:51.600]  the last couple years you know as an example in reference to people like
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:54.480]  octon deniget and uh... it's the first time i've
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:58.320]  ever heard in plundin using the other word besides holocaust
[1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:02.240]  uh... in connection with the word denier to last night and so jason now we
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:05.680]  have climate change deniers yeah and doesn't it suck because i used to love
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:09.040]  keith oberman i used to watch sports center all the time number one
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:11.760]  um... you know when he was going after the bush administration yeah was he a
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:15.360]  little bit left leaning sure was a little bit liberal sure did you go over
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:17.680]  the top when he was promoting obama yes
[1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:20.960]  but to have him weigh in on this you like a global warming
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:25.440]  and be so outright disgusting about it sucks but the global warming thing
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:27.840]  let's you know let's get that straight because
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:31.600]  first off the whole thing there is climate change obviously the climate
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:34.480]  always changes it's been changing for millions of years yes
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:37.360]  the question is is whether we're causing it that's the point whether we're
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:40.320]  causing it and if we're causing it i want to know something
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:44.160]  i want to know how it is that the emissions
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:49.600]  from my pickup truck are causing the polar ice caps on mars to shrink
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:53.840]  yeah it's absolutely ridiculous what is that i'm not sure we're gonna let them
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:59.200]  go i think it was back back stuff but yeah it's it sucks i'm like i mean it's
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:05.280]  ridiculous you think about that if the sun is what causes the climate to change
[1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:08.720]  see that's the big light bulb in the sky that produces all the energy yeah
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:12.160]  that's what's causing it whether it's global warming or global cooling or
[1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:16.160]  whatever it's not us i my pickup truck
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:20.800]  does not cause global warming or cooling on
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:25.600]  jupiter i'm sorry it doesn't know it doesn't and the great global warming
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:29.120]  swindle is about the best documentary you can watch about the subject and and
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:32.000]  another thing while i'm on this subject when they when they talk about the
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:36.320]  Kyoto protocols and making us cut back on our carbon footprint about 30%
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:39.440]  in an industrial nation but not the other guys
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:42.960]  somebody needs to explain to me how taking a factory in the united states of
[1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:46.160]  america that's got the epa all over their tail all the time
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:49.200]  and shipping it to china where they pollute the heck out of whatever
[1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:54.560]  how does that save the planet it doesn't it just bamboozles the american
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:58.880]  public because you remember why so many minds think alike oh we're brainwashed
[1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:05.840]  that's why all right let's go to gene in georgia gene what's on your mind
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:09.040]  yes sir hey i like uh the way y'all are talking today

[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:51.280]  and just from that office to this office it's totally different isn't it these
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:54.080]  offices i've never this is the first time i've been in the new
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:57.680]  in in the new central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:01.360]  i'll tell you something this is one plus central texas command center i want
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:04.960]  you to know that and all we need is a few more workers to fill it up because it
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:07.920]  is pretty empty still here but this is really from the money bomb
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:11.600]  you know this is from that you know 200 plus grand that we were able to raise
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.360]  in that one night and thank you so much to all the
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:15.840]  callers that donated to this but it's really going
[1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:19.280]  to actual work and by the way i want to mention uh it seems the bullhorn went
[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:22.880]  for about 50 g's last night and we're going to put that right into the office
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:26.880]  too so thank you so much uh folks can also support us by going to info wars
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:30.320]  dot com prism planet dot tv and uh getting movies like
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:33.680]  nine eleven chronicles truth rising end game fable enemies
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:37.120]  loose change final cut all right gene go ahead
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:40.480]  okay um i was wondering are you guys realize that the
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:44.800]  early american colonists were on their way to eliminating
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:48.560]  all taxation with um the former government known as
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:52.800]  the commonwealth we had four of them and they were using colonial
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:57.200]  script to eliminate all taxation are you all aware of that no no
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:01.840]  keep going because see um benjamin franklin knew this when he printed
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:05.040]  colonial script for the commonwealth of pennsylvania we had four of them
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:09.120]  pennsylvania massachusetts kentucky and virginia
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:12.160]  and the way it worked was instead of the uh
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:16.560]  taxes being used to pay interest to the international bankers
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:21.680]  uh interest was being used to pay all the taxes now they did have taxes back
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.280]  then but they were on their way to eliminating all of them
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:29.360]  and if you go to wikipedia and look up commonwealth or colonial script
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:32.400]  you'll start getting that some evidence of that
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:35.600]  and then you'll see benjamin franklin writing the first constitution for the
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:40.320]  commonwealth of pennsylvania and nowhere in that first constitution does this
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.480]  masonic forefather uh talk about the colonial
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:47.920]  script and what was the essence of a commonwealth
[1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:51.280]  so he was on his way to destroying the commonwealth right there
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:54.880]  and then when they wrote the constitution they they wrote the commonwealth out of
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:49:58.480]  existence and um i know you know golden silver is
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.240]  honest money but the colonial script was honest money as well because it was
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:05.920]  backed up by the the the deed to the property
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:10.000]  so um paper money can be honest as long as it's backed up
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.200]  but when they were they let the federal government borrow money without paying
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:17.600]  it back that they'll lose the wealth uh they'll lose the value of the currency
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:20.880]  well i can't agree with you or the one you do that i mean obviously it's going
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:23.600]  to lose the wealth and uh i think that you know
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:27.680]  gold and silver are really all that's retained value over the last couple
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:30.480]  centuries don't you bob i mean you can have these types of paper
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:33.040]  paper currency but you do need something to back it up
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:36.480]  and uh we don't have that anymore well they got they got us off the gold
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:39.360]  center a long time ago yeah i think you're the call gene we will be back
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:43.200]  taking your calls it's the alex joan show remember we'll be broadcasting live

[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:03.440]  i you know i just kind of want to help people out um in the way in the way they
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:07.680]  look at these things i think sometimes people look at it like you know
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:11.040]  you know this is the you know how you defeat that you know i mean i think we
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:14.720]  need to look at it differently or you've got a couple different
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:18.880]  ways to go about this thing you get hard currency which is gold and silver
[2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:22.240]  or you get you know paper fiat which is issued you know let's just say it's
[2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:25.520]  issued by the treasury with no interest and then you've got you know
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:28.240]  and then you've got kind of like the federal reserve system which is basically
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:31.280]  they have their cake and eat it too they get to use paper money
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:35.360]  you know with no backup and you know they
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:41.440]  they get to control the money supply so so let's look at this way
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:45.040]  a gold you know golden silver currency isn't a silver bullet
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:48.800]  let's say that they they they have a gold currency for a while
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:52.960]  and they consolidate all the gold into themselves and then you know what i mean
[2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:56.000]  they have their corrupt government take all the gold away from the people
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.360]  well they know that happened before man i mean all right even like in this
[2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:02.240]  country what was it in uh during world war two
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:05.440]  uh roosevelt had all the gold rounded up correct been there done that was
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:08.160]  before and that's in this country that was before world war two it was before
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:11.360]  world war two so you and listen your hard assets aren't always safe either in
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:13.920]  fact i think there's a law that says unless the coin is
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:17.280]  minted before a certain date in the early 1900s they can come and take it
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:21.200]  again right nothing is saying yeah they oh they got a law
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:24.400]  that's going to prohibit them from stealing certain certain types of gold
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:28.160]  oh those are law really i believe there is they're gonna they're gonna like obey
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:31.760]  their own law right and the reason that i go into a hard currency and i don't
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:35.440]  know if that's the complete answer to the you know the stock market collapse the
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:39.680]  financial situation i'm just saying that gold and silver have retained a value
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:42.720]  through the centuries and have always been sought after
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:45.920]  by not only the wealthy but the commoner as well so it's a good
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:48.880]  at least it's something for barter you know what i'm saying i don't think it's
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:53.520]  going to start solve our monetary system i would like to see more ron paul type
[2:02:53.520 --> 2:02:57.120]  policies take place in this country so we do have something to back our money
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:00.240]  up other than the industry that doesn't exist in this country anymore the value
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:04.240]  of gold and silver is a convention that has worked for
[2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:07.840]  for centuries and centuries and it keeps the
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:12.240]  the money powers from artificially inflating the money supply and hurting
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:15.680]  everybody's money that's the problem we have nowadays they just printed out a
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:20.720]  nothing willy nilly and they don't care about the consequences to the rest of
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:26.320]  us go if you had a a system which was backed by gold backed by silver or
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:30.080]  whatever they couldn't do that and then they have to behave themselves but
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:31.680]  that's just not the way we have it right now
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:34.720]  yeah we got a jump we got so many colors i think for the call michael
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:39.200]  let's go to joe in pennsylvania joe what's on your mind
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:46.640]  hey how you doing gentlemen good um i got a something i
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:49.600]  my uh... i got a problem with my membership but maybe that can be taken
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:53.200]  care of when i'm done yeah we can't do a customer service over the phone
[2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:57.200]  because i know that i did but i did want to i did want to say something
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:01.040]  um i was listening to the one gentleman he was
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:04.960]  you know pretty exasperated about you know what do we do we hear all this
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:07.760]  information and you know what are we supposed to do with the
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:12.160]  information and uh... i i listened to the shows
[2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:16.880]  over and over and it's like there's so much going on we're being bombarded
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:20.960]  from every single angle and it's like you jump from one subject to the next
[2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:24.560]  but i think that you know when push comes to show
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:29.040]  when they come to take us out of our houses that's when you're going to see
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:32.400]  the real uh... do you hit the fan so to say
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.960]  and that's when the people are going to start fighting back
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:37.920]  well i hope that the people fight back before that i hope it doesn't come to
[2:04:37.920 --> 2:04:40.720]  roundups i mean mtv put out a commercial
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:44.480]  uh... last year where basically they said that the holocaust could happen
[2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:48.560]  again in this country and they had people rounded up out of uh...

[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:16.480]  all right folks we are just busting through your calls here at the alex jones
[2:08:16.480 --> 2:08:19.440]  so i am jason bermus sitting in all week
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:27.760]  we're going to go to uh robert uh john bob jessey and more
[2:08:27.760 --> 2:08:30.960]  but first i want to play this for the prison planet dot tv viewers
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:36.960]  these are a couple commercials that mtv put out mtthink.mtv.com put out last
[2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:39.920]  year and uh they basically are warning the average joe
[2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:43.680]  that hey uh guess what the holocaust happened to people just like us
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:09:10.720]  that didn't really think it was possible so let's play the clip
[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:18.720]  so
[2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:48.280]  and there you have it
[2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:51.680]  now I know that doesn't make for great radio because you can't see what's
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:55.400]  going on but in the first one basically people are rounded up right out of a
[2:09:55.400 --> 2:09:58.360]  subway Bob yeah and it's like it when they're rounded up right out of their
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.600]  house mm-hmm and what was waiting for him outside big trucks nice truck full of
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:06.440]  other people from the family which of course exactly what Jack McClam has
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:11.000]  always said when the tyranny comes it's wearing a uniform exactly we're gonna
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:16.840]  have McClam on in about 20 minutes all right let's take some callers let's go
[2:10:16.840 --> 2:10:21.280]  to let's see who hasn't hung up on me and I believe Robert in California we
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:25.520]  just went to right so we're on a Robert in California is next good let's go to
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:29.960]  Robert in California then how you doing Jason good no I haven't hung up on you
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:36.200]  but a little bit pet peeved today okay okay everybody today I'm not really mad
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:40.480]  at you but you know if I keep hearing this over and over again about these
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:46.920]  large march marches large demonstrations you know that does bring somewhat
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:53.320]  media attention and and and put the spotlight on some of the problem but
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:57.200]  the really thing that's really going to change things is if we don't get in there
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:11:02.500]  and start grabbing back the handles of government we did that here in Los
[2:11:02.500 --> 2:11:09.280]  Angeles County several of us who worked on Dr. Paul's campaign ran for the
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:13.360]  Republican Central Committee and got elected that's awesome so I like
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:17.020]  campaign for Liberty stuff right because I love what Ron Paul did out of that
[2:11:17.020 --> 2:11:21.200]  election not I mean he didn't win but he started an organization that is supposed
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:25.280]  to get people like ourselves grassroots elected into office so that we can make
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:28.280]  a change I think that everybody out there that can run for city council
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:32.280]  member or a local state senator or a member of Congress should do so and I
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:36.080]  think that dovetails with the uh... with the ever griffin's organization
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:40.080]  free to force our national history of the you lost the power incrementally
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:43.040]  and now you got to take it back incrementally you got it you actually
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:46.520]  rather than just talk about it and grab about it go out there and you run for
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:47.920]  dog catcher that's right
[2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:49.720]  you know continue man
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:54.760]  right and so uh... a few of us even got on to the executive board our biggest
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:59.560]  problem now is put basically like any any political organization on special on
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:01.120]  the republican side
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:05.960]  since they bomb uh... sort of ruin the name is getting people registered as
[2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:10.680]  republicans getting other republicans elected and raising money
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:14.600]  uh... of course a big one raising money helps she shows that those of us who
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:17.600]  actually went out and put ourselves into the wheels
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:19.160]  to uh... you know
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:22.880]  say that we don't really need money from special interest or people that we
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:26.680]  don't necessarily want to be friendly with
[2:12:26.680 --> 2:12:30.480]  uh... and then also choosing candidates within your local area
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:34.440]  to run that's what the central committee does basically do endorsements
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:38.800]  and do campaign research and development and i think they have these
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:43.160]  organizations or what we call precinct leaders or block captains
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:44.680]  all over the united states
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:46.520]  but until we start
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:50.000]  grabbing at the bottom and then reaching for the top we're never gonna change the
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:53.160]  top because once you take away their base of power
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:54.560]  and their in their funding
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.040]  which is pretty much what we'd like to do
[2:12:58.040 --> 2:13:01.480]  nothing's gonna happen all the all the marches all the protestors
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:06.120]  well i mean i mean i will first of all i think the marches do help me we have
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:09.360]  not gotten the numbers that we need to to make ourselves
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:13.320]  relevant in the everyday media number one number two i i totally and
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:16.240]  completely agree with you that we need to put ourselves in the office
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:19.400]  but i then i look at myself i'm like am i ready to commit you know two years in
[2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:22.960]  my life into some local office am i ready to do that hopefully somebody else
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:26.480]  out there is and maybe that's not just not my calling bob
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:28.460]  you know a couple of my friends um...
[2:13:28.460 --> 2:13:29.840]  of state new york eyes
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:33.040]  actually i i'm a senior york i my friends i went to college with
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:36.480]  they were from a long island and they went all the way out to minnesota for
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:38.200]  the big ron paul rally
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:42.040]  and one of them one of the two of them actually got chosen by campaign for
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:45.760]  liberty to look run for local office and be backed by the organization
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:47.560]  this year i'm not sure if you want
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:50.760]  but it shows how you know he was in his mid twenties how young people can get
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:52.400]  involved how old people can get involved
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:55.800]  and i'm with this guy i mean i think that we do have to take back local office
[2:13:55.800 --> 2:13:57.720]  i think the smaller you start
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:13:59.080]  the bigger you'll get
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:02.360]  you know i i don't yeah i don't think that you're going to find many of us
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:06.720]  able to win a congressional and election or an actual senate election
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:10.200]  cindy she hand couldn't even win her congressional spot there was enough
[2:14:10.200 --> 2:14:13.360]  people out there that didn't want the incumbent policy whether they fudge the
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:14.480]  numbers or whatever
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:16.440]  you know there was somebody that had a face
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:19.880]  a name and you know i honestly a message that i could get behind you know
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:23.520]  let's end the war to my county commissioners and things like that mayors
[2:14:23.520 --> 2:14:27.080]  uh... you know that that type of thing where you they can have a impact on the
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:28.160]  local community
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:30.160]  you're here in austin what a few years ago
[2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:33.520]  and alex jones actually you know kind of led the thing
[2:14:33.520 --> 2:14:36.920]  you know we had this got the city council to pass a resolution uh... against
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:39.720]  the patriot act i remember that i mean that's the kind of thing we're talking
[2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:40.960]  about you
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:42.120]  you gotta go
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:46.080]  from the bottom up and it doesn't it may not be glamorous you know to be a
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:47.840]  county commissioner i don't know
[2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:51.240]  but things like that have to be done on over the country i'm all sure that it
[2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:54.760]  is absolutely not glamorous robert i thank you for the call
[2:14:54.760 --> 2:14:58.440]  all right let's jump to our next caller i believe we are on john in canada john
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:00.240]  what's on your mind
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:02.800]  they don't know what
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:05.140]  uh... yeah so i'm gonna be a bit of a
[2:15:05.140 --> 2:15:07.760]  uh... christ advocate here i want to ask you
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:09.720]  how much money do we need to
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:13.760]  give you in charity before you guys understand just the most basic
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:15.920]  precepts of what justice is
[2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:17.280]  you know the problem
[2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:21.720]  with you guys by jacking our freedom movement is that you want to know what
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:22.840]  simple thing
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:26.760]  and instead you have to look like man that we're in the real world we don't
[2:15:26.760 --> 2:15:28.720]  live on fairy tales in class
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:32.160]  and you know you need to hold on you need to pay people the guy running my
[2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:36.040]  show right now across the the way he has to make a living
[2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:38.200]  you know i mean he has to be able to pay his rent
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:40.040]  i have to be able to pay my rent
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:44.120]  my garbage my electric somebody to watch my dogs when i'm gone
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:47.880]  uh... i'm not rocking any diamonds in the prison planet dot tv you got this
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:48.840]  this is a uh...
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:52.960]  metal necklace that cost me five dollars what is his point uh... his point is
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:56.120]  that we're hijacking the free movement because we take money
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:15:59.880]  because we take money that was at your point it's absolutely is point he's a
[2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:01.840]  he is it is it so on
[2:16:01.840 --> 2:16:05.600]  he's not i i i i i i i so what's your point is that he's at your point my
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:08.240]  point for example ray mcgovern you had him on
[2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:12.320]  ray mcgovern is fully cognitively aware that the bush administration doctor the
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:13.680]  national intelligence
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:17.000]  estimate on invading iraq they took the c i a's words
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:17.800]  rewrote
[2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:19.400]  entire paragraph
[2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:21.800]  and con you as a victim to die
[2:16:21.800 --> 2:16:23.600]  now you have a coward
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:27.400]  it's a high-jacking our freedom of the fact that i don't mention
[2:16:27.400 --> 2:16:31.320]  well i mean i don't know if you know what we hold on i i took i took
[2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:34.680]  mcgovern to task on a lot of things including the appointments of the
[2:16:34.680 --> 2:16:36.200]  obama administration
[2:16:36.200 --> 2:16:39.680]  ron manuel robert gates i got what i could have a lot
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:42.920]  hold on i got what i could have the guys not even an office yet were five
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:44.160]  days away from being
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:45.920]  inaugurated
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:48.840]  so what else did you want me to tell you talked about the bohemian grove for
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:51.760]  christ sake i also talked about uh...
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:53.920]  well what else i talked about i also talked about
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:55.000]  and that
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.480]  uh... obama and hillary attended builder bird
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:16:58.680]  so in a in a
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:17:02.240]  less than our period i brought up a lot of good points that were against his
[2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:05.640]  point of view i don't know if you want me to viciously attack every guest that
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:08.800]  comes on here but then we're not gonna have guests
[2:17:08.800 --> 2:17:14.000]  and i don't like you know that i don't think i've got a problem with is putting
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  words in other people's mouth it'd be great if i could just speak for myself
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:20.640]  you know what i don't know you can't speak for yourself when you accuse us of
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:23.800]  hijacking the freedom movement who is the free who the hell are you
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:25.920]  we're all people and
[2:17:25.920 --> 2:17:27.320]  you're your justice
[2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:31.720]  no justice requires evidence to prove someone's guilt or innocence by bush
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:35.560]  closing in nine eleven investigations immediately after the terrorist event
[2:17:35.560 --> 2:17:38.600]  he's committing at the highest act of treason's but you guys go it's just a
[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:40.200]  puppet never mind him it's
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:41.480]  it is a puppet
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:45.000]  listen listen you realize yesterday this is something i haven't talked about on
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:47.320]  the show and you keep screaming what we're gonna let him go because i can't
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:47.960]  take it
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:51.960]  but uh... it's just totally ridiculous mentally ill jealousy or something
[2:17:51.960 --> 2:17:53.880]  the deal is and i want to see if i can
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:17:57.880]  he is a puppet i want to communicate this to that fellow listen
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:01.880]  yes he is a puppet when we say bush did this and bush did that
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:05.960]  we know that he is a representative he is a poster child
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:11.520]  for for a totalitarian oligarchy we know that he has no power into himself
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:13.760]  he's being told what to do he's a puppet so
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:17.040]  he's a poster child when you say when you say obama did this or obama did that
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:20.520]  it's not him it's his handlers it's it's it's his controllers
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:21.440]  uh... so
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:24.320]  you know we're not supposed to take any money bob how dare i make a movie
[2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:28.160]  and charge for you know i give it all away for free we give it all this will

[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:40.520]  he could get paid a couple of million dollars a year and he's credible right
[2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:42.520]  but
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:46.520]  you know but but these got you guys i know about this operation a little bit
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:49.520]  it's always just by skin of the teeth all the time all the time all the time
[2:18:49.520 --> 2:18:51.520]  this is the first big expansion they've ever done

[2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:55.760]  to uh...
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:58.880]  it was like the size of the office for you know come on
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:04.320]  you have got to you've got to generate the cash in order to run an operation
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:05.820]  and that's just tough
[2:19:05.820 --> 2:19:08.600]  one thing i love about my show the simple truth
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:11.640]  since it's all volunteer and there is no money involved

[2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:31.560]  Jesse in Wisconsin Jesse what's on your mind
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:36.160]  just calling up I've got a couple issues on the mind the first we're gonna be
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:40.560]  talking with your next guest about taxes and ordinances and things like that
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:44.560]  going on in cities I just found out today on the Madison Wisconsin there's a
[2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:50.080]  new zoning rules going on to adapt to climate change as the city of Madison
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:55.000]  Wisconsin I ordinances to adapt to climate change that's the title actually
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:59.480]  went on the city of Madison web page and the PDF that had all this information
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:04.360]  is now completely blank there's like eight blank pages so it's gonna be hard
[2:28:04.360 --> 2:28:08.160]  for listeners to actually go look at that look for the cash aid version man if
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:11.360]  you if you bring it up into a Google search you might be able to get lucky
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:14.480]  and get the cash aid version that's often how I get news stories that they
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:21.320]  pull continue there is a business and media dot org has the just the news
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:24.680]  article explaining some of this on there but basically what they want to do it
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:29.360]  sounds good on the surface for instance if you cut down a tree on your property
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:32.480]  the ordinance will be you have to plant two more and that sounds good but
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:35.360]  sometimes you know you have to take a tree out because it's ruining the sewage
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:37.760]  lines that lead to the streets and things like that and planting two more
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:44.520]  trees will just give you the same problem 20 years down the road so that's
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:47.840]  conditioning yeah all just conditioning I remember the planet for tree
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:50.680]  foundation when I was a kid you know they make everything out to be like that
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:54.640]  you know the best thing ever and you know we're saving the planet and there's a
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:57.960]  good feel we're all gonna recycle blah blah blah blah when Clinton was president
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:01.280]  he pulled those a bunch of trees into the Grand Canyon so that so that the
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:06.360]  camera view would be better if we're his saving the environment I don't even know
[2:29:06.360 --> 2:29:13.080]  if I'm against that all right thank you so much go for it a lot of people are
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:16.800]  talking about buying gold and silver these days I just thought what the
[2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:21.240]  listeners know and be aware that buying gold and silver is not just as easy as
[2:29:21.240 --> 2:29:23.960]  just taking your money down and buying it you should really pay attention to the
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:28.000]  ratio you know the closer it is to 80 to one you buy silver the closer it's 40 to
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:31.920]  one you buy gold and that way you can actually create some wealth out of your
[2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:35.880]  own investments on top of the gold and silver actually just being in your safe
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:39.560]  for what all right man I thank for the call Jesse I am not a gold expert I
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:43.400]  just know that it's shiny and it retains value and it seems to double in
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:47.880]  value every few years it's the Alex Jones show I am Jason Burmese riding

[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:51.920]  world order global government and why it's so important to you know keep our

[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:13.920]  can get your information well I'm in my 29th year as a volunteer educated our
[2:34:13.920 --> 2:34:20.640]  police and soldiers and I have a website of one of our associations police and
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:27.480]  military against the new world order at you find that very easily by going to
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:36.320]  triple W dot Jack Mclam and it's spelled mc capital L a mb just like a lamb
[2:34:36.320 --> 2:34:47.680]  Mclam.org Jack Mclam.org and you'll find all of my qualifications there I was
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:50.800]  the most highly decorated police officer in the history of phoenix
[2:34:50.800 --> 2:34:55.480]  Arizona and after I became a constitutionalist and started serving
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:35:00.760]  the people instead of serving the city I became the most fired officer in the
[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:06.800]  history of phoenix Arizona and so I started writing my police and military
[2:35:06.800 --> 2:35:11.200]  publication the aid and the bat police military newsletter on constitutional
[2:35:11.200 --> 2:35:15.640]  issues and that really ticked them off because they didn't want our police and
[2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:20.400]  military to even be thinking about the Constitution they just want them to
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:28.240]  follow their corrupt orders and do what they're told to do and I took issue with
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:35.000]  that because I saw firsthand how we were committing crimes we police officers
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:42.720]  were committing crimes in in supposedly to arrest the criminals we would have to
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:48.200]  become criminals to arrest the criminals and that offended me as a Christian
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:54.480]  police officer and so after taking so much of that for about three years I
[2:35:54.480 --> 2:36:01.960]  became the most highly decorated officer in Phoenix Arizona history and then I
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:12.440]  began to change after I had a man about 85 90 years old upset me because I
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:20.120]  didn't know the Constitution and in a speech I was giving out at Sun City
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:25.760]  Arizona for senior citizens on how they could protect themselves from muggings
[2:36:25.760 --> 2:36:33.480]  and rapes and house house break-ins and so forth they were undergoing quite a
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:38.680]  serious attack as they'd cashed their self-security checks they would be
[2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:46.360]  attacked and have it taken away from them so they invited me out to speak and 85
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:52.840]  90 year old man embarrassed me to tears almost there as he began to say didn't
[2:36:52.840 --> 2:36:56.680]  you swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States and I said well
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:03.800]  certainly I did or to the Constitution and the people and so forth I said yes
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:09.080]  I did I did it when I was in during the Vietnam War took that oath and then I
[2:37:09.080 --> 2:37:13.880]  took the oath when I became a police officer and he began to question me
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:17.840]  about the Constitution and I didn't have any answers for him like what is the
[2:37:17.840 --> 2:37:23.520]  Sixth Amendment to the Bill of Rights and and you know so forth and so on and
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:30.080]  he just embarrassed me to pieces and I hated that man at that time I mean I
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:34.840]  really hated him and I went home that night feeling that I could go out
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:43.120]  underneath the door with the clothes I was so low and so upset and but after
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:49.920]  about two weeks of not sleeping at night God was working on me brother and so
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.480]  finally I set up in the middle of the bed one night and realized that that
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:38:00.120]  little 85 90 year old man was right I should have known the Constitution and
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:04.960]  the Bill of Rights that I had sworn to protect and so I went right down to the
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:10.480]  library and the city library had trouble finding a Constitution and Bill of
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:17.160]  Rights for me but they finally found it and I took it home and studied it and
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:25.400]  then joined a constitutional group in Mesa, Arizona where I was quite shocked
[2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:31.560]  that when I got there at this meeting I didn't know it was a tax protest meeting
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:39.160]  and I was everybody you went around the room and told who you are and what you
[2:38:39.160 --> 2:38:43.720]  do for a living and they got to me I told him I was a finished police
[2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:51.520]  officer and the position I served in and everybody really got quiet you know
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:56.360]  and that night when I left they all walked me out to the car and waved to me
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:02.200]  wave goodbye well I continue to go to these constitutional training meetings
[2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:08.480]  for several weeks and then the leader told me he says the reason we walked
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:11.960]  you out their car that night was so you wouldn't copy down our license plates
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:19.640]  and numbers when you left we became good friends after several months of me
[2:39:19.640 --> 2:39:24.720]  attending the meetings and really been earnestly seeking to learn about my
[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:30.960]  constitutional oath so when I came back to the police department I started
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:37.880]  asking my my sergeant and my captain and on up through the chain of command if
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:44.440]  they knew what was in the Constitution because we were regularly violating our
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:50.000]  constitutional oath and I didn't know that until I studied it you know and then
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:55.600]  I realized that we're we're violating our oath all the time and and of course
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:40:02.240]  the officers didn't know what their oath pertained of like me so I started my
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:08.400]  newsletter constitutional issues for lawman and soldiers and boy that that
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:14.080]  blew a hole in my career because they liked soldiers and police not knowing
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:19.200]  about the Constitution and so they could be told to do things that were
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:23.880]  criminal in a violation of their constitutional oath and they do it because
[2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:30.920]  they didn't know about it so I was set out to change that and so then I was
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:37.560]  fired repeatedly for my constitutional work and but the neat thing about it was
[2:40:37.560 --> 2:40:42.840]  I had a very liberal civil service board in the city of Phoenix and when a
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:48.040]  police officer was fired he could go before the civil service board or she
[2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:53.560]  and state their case and in each case when I would go in and tell them about
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:59.000]  my constitutional writings to my fellow police officers they would return me to
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:05.560]  work with full back pay say you can't fire a man for what he believes and what
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:12.240]  he says and they the very liberal civil service board said they didn't agree
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:15.920]  with anything I wrote in my constitutional publication but they
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:20.440]  realized I had a right to write it to my fellow officers so they returned me to
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:26.880]  work each time and then my chief decided to try to get me killed you know
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:32.000]  because he couldn't get rid of me any other time and he had state police
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:37.200]  federal police getting a hold of him telling him to stop my glam for writing
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:43.680]  this constitutional publication so he decided on a plan he put me out in the
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:48.080]  high crime area of South Phoenix the war zone of South Phoenix we call it
[2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:54.200]  where I always did work but he put me out on midnight's and told all the all the
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:42:02.120]  police officers 2,500 of us that not to go if McClam calls for a backup don't go
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:07.720]  to aid him don't go if he calls for a backup do not go and help him so the
[2:42:07.720 --> 2:42:11.800]  chief was trying to get me killed course my chief of police Ruben Ortega was a
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:16.240]  murderer anyway he had murdered a man and got away with it because he was chief
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:21.920]  of police but he was gonna murder me you know so it was tough for the next five
[2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:26.640]  years I worked without a backup in the war zone of South Phoenix and got
[2:42:26.640 --> 2:42:33.480]  injured a numerous time and finally the civil city doctors realized that Ruben
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:37.560]  Ortega the chief was trying to get me killed because they kept patching me up
[2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:44.240]  and so I rested a drug smuggler illegal alien out of Mexico one morning
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:52.160]  Sunday morning and we got in a big fight that lasted almost an hour and nobody
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:57.440]  would come as a backup backup for me and so finally it ended up I was so
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:43:02.840]  injured with my neck and back and shoulder that all I could do was hold
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:08.960]  on to this guy's foot I had a foot armlock on his foot and he couldn't get
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:13.920]  away so finally he was dragging me down the street and another officer drove
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:19.600]  by and saw me and he stopped and helped me he wasn't supposed to but he did and
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:25.000]  we got him under arrest and so when I went to the city doctors that time they
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:29.160]  told me that they were not going to release me to go back to work they were
[2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:35.840]  going to retire me out and so my very evil police chief Ruben Ortega fought
[2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:42.320]  my retirement didn't want to give me any retirement pay at all even though I was
[2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:48.520]  disabled and so it was a battle but I finally retired out with a small pension
[2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:53.880]  and I've been doing this work now for 29 years of trying to educate our police
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:44:01.080]  and soldiers to try to get them to realize that they have an oath and
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:06.480]  responsibility to the people not to the city Jack this is this is Bob Dacey I
[2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:10.520]  wanted to ask you something here I've never had the pleasure of meeting you
[2:44:10.520 --> 2:44:14.440]  in person I would love to do that because I really admire what you do you take it
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:17.880]  rather than you take it right to the bottom line you always say that if
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:21.440]  tyranny comes it's gonna be wearing a uniform that's right and your whole
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:25.120]  thing is to is to wake up the police and the military is to what their oath
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:29.480]  really means to the Constitution I know you had that that Operation Vampire
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:34.560]  Killer 2000 I read that thing everything in it is just right on I wanted to I
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:37.920]  want to ask you this question this is kind of a down-to-earth question in
[2:44:37.920 --> 2:44:42.440]  terms of what a beat cop experiences yeah because in Austin we're having some
[2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:46.240]  problems constitutional problems with certain things and how does a beat cop
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:53.160]  overcome the defense of necessity where where his superiors say well guys we
[2:44:53.160 --> 2:44:57.280]  just got to do this you know we have we have to do this particular procedure
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:02.440]  because we just have to just to save the children or keep to keep the babies
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:06.800]  safe or whatever as a cop defend against that when what he's being told to do is
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:16.240]  illegal well luckily I got into law enforcement 1976 and at that time we had
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:23.360]  a night stick a gun and some pepper spray and that was it we didn't have
[2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:30.120]  stun guns we didn't have anything else and we handled it mono a mono you know
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:33.920]  we would get in a fist fight with somebody or a rattling match with
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:40.080]  somebody and take them down or they take us down but the other and but we
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:46.000]  always had the radio there to call for a backup so usually we would win but I did
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:52.320]  lose seven of my brother officers during the years I was on the force there in
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:56.160]  the war zone of South Phoenix now I'm talking about when I when the when the
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:45:59.960]  you're the the powers that be in the police department want their cops to do
[2:45:59.960 --> 2:46:03.840]  something which is constitutionally questioning questionable like for example
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:07.640]  here in Austin we're having this big dispute about what we call vampire cops
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:12.680]  where they you know they pull somebody over for driving while intoxicated and
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:17.840]  when he uses his fifth amendment to not cooperate they force it they
[2:46:17.840 --> 2:46:23.480]  forcibly take blood from him and you know you you what do you have a position on
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:27.960]  that particular issue the the vampire cop versus the fifth amendment well it's
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:36.320]  it is totally within the purview of the Constitution that a person say no to
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:43.200]  giving evidence to convict him even blood yeah but the cops nowadays say yeah
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:49.040]  but we just have to well somebody yeah they don't know anything about the
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:54.800]  Constitution that's the sad thing the new cops coming on matter of fact they're
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:47:00.880]  they're hiring cops after I went through and they finally got rid of me through
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:06.920]  retirement they changed the hiring practices that no more would they hire a
[2:47:06.920 --> 2:47:12.400]  Christian cop with a high moral value with high moral values they just wouldn't
[2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:18.560]  do it because I was not and I convinced other Christian police officers and
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:23.320]  other police officers not to do anything criminal because it is not what we
[2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:31.200]  should do to get a person into jail and so I was there on the scene many times
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:39.200]  like one night some officers stopped a patriot and the patriot new questions to
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:46.120]  ask and comments to say and so he called for a backup and I appeared on the scene
[2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:52.000]  with some other officers there and he had a gun on the front seat that was out
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:58.360]  in the open and so to punish him the the officers decided that they would say
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:03.400]  that his coat was over the gun and booking for a felony for having a
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:07.280]  concealed weapon in the vehicle and I said no you're not gonna do that if you
[2:48:07.280 --> 2:48:12.920]  do I'm gonna tell you know and and so they didn't do it but another thing we
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:17.280]  started doing in the city of Phoenix is that if we had somebody we didn't like
[2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:23.320]  like a patriot a Christian or a patriot that would ask us questions that we
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:28.320]  couldn't answer about the Constitution or something then we would fall down and
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:36.000]  scream and say he pushed me he pushed me and so we would turn a misdemeanor
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  stop into a felony against the person and of course he didn't push it but it
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:47.120]  would become a felony so I would reject that and tell the officers in my news
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:51.520]  letter about don't do this because you become a criminal just like the
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:48:58.040]  criminals we're trying to arrest you know and so you're right it's today it's
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:03.240]  even more so that we commit crimes we get on the witness stand and lie against
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:10.560]  somebody like procedural procedural things like for example we have new
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:14.080]  technology now that wasn't available during the time the Constitution was
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:17.080]  written yeah you know in the Bill of Rights was written right you know the
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:21.360]  fifth the Fifth Amendment says you cannot search somebody's houses or papers
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:25.360]  or personal effects you know but without reasonable cause going to a judge and
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:30.360]  getting a warrant right all that and it describes the persons to the things to
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:35.360]  be seized and all that stuff oh yeah but now I'm playing devil's advocate here
[2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:40.520]  now now we have we have technology where the evidence of the crime is in your
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:45.000]  body in terms of say driving while intoxicated and they want that and they
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:49.520]  want that evidence yeah and and so it's not your it's not in your house anymore
[2:49:49.520 --> 2:49:54.360]  the evidence is in your body and so you know here for what's supposedly legal
[2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:59.600]  is they take you downtown to a medical facility if you refuse to cooperate and
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:05.240]  force and forcibly draw your blood well that's totally unconstitutional as you
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:10.360]  know but they'll go by the Constitution anymore because it restricts them to
[2:50:10.360 --> 2:50:15.120]  much we're going into a totalitarian state here in this country and they
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:19.400]  don't want to use the Constitution and don't want you to use the Constitution
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:24.160]  anymore but that is totally unconstitutional for them to make you
[2:50:24.160 --> 2:50:28.600]  should be able to decide if you want to give blood or if you want to do the
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:33.880]  the breathalyzer test and it used to be where you could make that decision now
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:38.480]  they could find you by taking your license away for a couple years and so
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:43.360]  forth it wasn't much you could do about that but you did have a right to say no
[2:50:43.360 --> 2:50:48.480]  for those kind of tests but now that they've thrown the Constitution out they
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:51.640]  do whatever they want all right it's the Alex Jones so we'll be back after this

[2:53:12.640 --> 2:53:16.520]  act as savior but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis
[2:53:16.520 --> 2:53:20.760]  will be on a scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty shelves
[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:24.600]  will spread fear and panic across the land the insiders have discovered that

[2:54:15.280 --> 2:54:20.040]  all week for Alex Bob Daisy riding shotgun and we're with Jack Mclam who's
[2:54:20.040 --> 2:54:23.840]  really been at this almost 30 years folks before the internet there were people
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:28.200]  like Jack Mclam that would actually they'd make a newsletter isn't that it's
[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:32.280]  like it's so bizarre to hear people that but there were people before Alex Jones
[2:54:32.280 --> 2:54:36.160]  there will be people after Alex Jones and you know Jack is one of those guys
[2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:39.520]  that took the technology at the time to the next level you know as I described
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:43.200]  in the first segment in the beginning of the show often when I go through a lot
[2:54:43.200 --> 2:54:47.840]  of these news clips and they're giving the anti-side to global government or
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:51.200]  the New World Order they're interviewing Jack Mclam so it's just a great
[2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:53.720]  privilege to have you on the program and it's a great privilege to have you out
[2:54:53.720 --> 2:54:58.800]  here waking up even more military police and even just common listeners thank you
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:03.240]  brother yeah for those listeners out there that don't know I'm a military
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:09.360]  veteran and had a top-secret clearance during the Vietnam War and so I do
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:13.920]  communicate very well with my fellow soldiers out there too about the
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:18.440]  constitutional oath and everything speaking of the constitutional oath Jack
[2:55:18.440 --> 2:55:21.720]  this is something that happened to me four years ago I was interviewing here
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:26.560]  locally in Austin as a sheriff's candidate running for sheriff and and I
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:30.440]  asked him the question is I asked him if he would swear an oath to protect and
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:34.240]  defend the Constitution and he said absolutely I asked him if the Bill of
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:37.720]  Rights was part of the Constitution he said oh of course and then I asked him
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:42.800]  if the Fourth Amendment was part of the Constitution he said oh absolutely part
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:46.240]  of the Bill of Rights yes sir he said all officers swear an oath to protect
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:50.440]  and defend that and I then asked him this question I said well if the
[2:55:50.440 --> 2:55:53.720]  feds came into town and then they were having a little manpower shortage and
[2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:58.680]  they wanted your help to search my house without a warrant would you do it he
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:05.280]  said absolutely that's right that's right where we're taught in the city
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:10.840]  departments that the feds are our superiors and when they come to town we
[2:56:10.840 --> 2:56:14.760]  whine and dine them and give them the keys to the city which is absolutely
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:19.600]  absurd we swore to protect the Constitution and the people not the
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:23.280]  city or not the federal government well what this guy told me is in the
[2:56:23.280 --> 2:56:27.040]  response to that and he said he said I would search your house because if the
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:31.120]  if the feds wanted me to because they would have reasonable cause and I said
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:34.400]  well sir if they had reasonable cause they can get a warrant and then he said
[2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:38.800]  this he said it would it's not my job as a law enforcement officer to interpret
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:43.400]  the law so brother basically we and this guy's the Travis County Sheriff right
[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:49.200]  now Greg Allen boy that's a shame and because he's so wrong I know and it's
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:54.200]  it's it's kind of it's pathetic but the problem is and you identify it they
[2:56:54.200 --> 2:56:58.480]  swear an oath to protect and defend a document they haven't read and don't
[2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:05.280]  understand that's right that's right I had to go out and take your training from
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:12.600]  a very good organization there in Mesa Arizona to learn all about my oath and
[2:57:12.600 --> 2:57:17.520]  all about the Constitution Bill of Rights and what I swore to and we don't
[2:57:17.520 --> 2:57:21.400]  know if we don't give them any training like that we haven't take the open and
[2:57:21.400 --> 2:57:25.800]  tell them to forget it well that's what you're here for right now I wonder how
[2:57:25.800 --> 2:57:29.000]  successful do you think you've been over all these years how many cops and
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:33.240]  military personnel actually you think understand the Constitution understand
[2:57:33.240 --> 2:57:38.600]  the Bill of Rights understand well well sadly most of them are retired now
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:45.120]  except the ones we're reaching today you know we're reaching more today but we've
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:51.400]  been out of 29 years and so as volunteers here and a lot of them have
[2:57:51.400 --> 2:57:56.840]  retired out but but we like the Vampire Killer 2000 we've got like two
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:03.760]  two million five hundred thousand copies out there and it's done a
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:11.160]  absolutely fantastic job we get officers and soldiers that contact us even
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:18.440]  retired ones who had read the operation Vampire Killer 2000 and some were
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:23.440]  thrown out of office as police officers and soldiers because they read it too
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:27.080]  anytime you're trying to hand out information about the Constitution and
[2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:31.160]  Bill of Rights being really the only authority in this country you're gone

[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:42.360]  why do you give the viewers just a just a brief synopsis of who you are and what
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:49.080]  this is all about okay we're a group of property owners here in in Missouri
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:56.280]  basically and we look out for the interests of private property rights we
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:02.080]  try to ward off them never ending infringement by non-governmental
[3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:09.320]  organizations as well as governmental organizations are our latest battle
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:14.280]  here is dealing with the Missouri Department of Conservation was on your
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:20.600]  program about a month ago and the situation then was that they were
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:28.360]  proposing several right increases but the thing that affected us most was their
[3:02:28.360 --> 3:02:39.880]  their pro their plan their request they currently permit no charge permits for
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:45.920]  hunting deer and turkey on your own property if you own five acres they
[3:02:45.920 --> 3:02:52.520]  wanted to extend that to so you had to own 80 acres and that affected some 70
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:59.720]  80,000 landowners that would have to then start buying permits to hunt on their
[3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:08.200]  own property and they also wanted to have you register the legal description of
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:13.640]  your property into this property registry that would be for the Missouri
[3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:24.360]  Department of Conservation they withdrew virtually all of their of their
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:31.480]  request for change except the property registration part that they are still
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:40.160]  hanging on to but they did back off the implementation date for six months and
[3:03:40.160 --> 3:03:47.640]  they changed the rhetoric they soften the rhetoric before the comment period
[3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:54.440]  which ran back in December before that they were telling us how it was going
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:04:01.480]  to be after they received now these are their numbers I don't know how accurate
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:10.320]  they are but the numbers they put out was that they received 17,000 comments from
[3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:18.760]  10,000 people in a 30-day period our organization our Ozark Property Rights
[3:04:18.760 --> 3:04:25.200]  Congress group we submitted the letter to the director of the Missouri
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:31.160]  Department of Conservation explaining to them what we would do as property owners
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:38.360]  that we would not buy their permits that we would post our property and not allow
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:44.440]  hunting with those who had permits and so forth and that we weren't going to
[3:04:44.440 --> 3:04:48.480]  register our property all right we'll come back right after this Russell it's

[3:08:05.400 --> 3:08:13.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[3:08:13.120 --> 3:08:20.640]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[3:08:20.640 --> 3:08:30.000]  Alex Jones I just want to see if I've gotten all the information correctly
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:35.880]  first of all they want you to get a permit to hunt on your own land and it
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:40.080]  used to be that if you own 10 acres you didn't need this permit but now you have
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:45.240]  to own up to 80 acres to be without this permit secondly when you do get this
[3:08:45.240 --> 3:08:49.800]  permit they also want you to give a record of all of your property and then
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:52.800]  the third thing I'm not quite sure if I got this right but they're going to
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:58.000]  allow other people who have permits to hunt on your privately owned land that
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:04.800]  is that is the landowner's prerogative what we as landowners are are wanting to
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:10.880]  do is just post our property for no hunting until this whole matter is
[3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:18.960]  resolved now the part about the acreage limitations they've dropped that if you
[3:09:18.960 --> 3:09:27.920]  own at least five acres they will give you a pay no cost a free permit but you
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:32.400]  know there's something about these permits they want you to have one they
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:39.120]  won't charge you for it so when you get these permits you sign them and when you
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:45.880]  do this as is with so many other things that you're asked to sign it'll say by
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:52.760]  signing this you agree to and blah blah blah and therein you give away quite
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:58.800]  often so many of your rights and there's a big question as to what authority
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:04.120]  people such as conservation department employees have but once you've signed
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:11.800]  these permits if you'll read the fine print you'll see that by signing this
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:17.800]  permit you give us the authority to do so and so you're turning over your
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:22.080]  authority to the state whereas you're a sovereign individual and it's your
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:24.680]  property and you should be able to do whatever you like on it you shouldn't
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:28.960]  have to beg for permission and then put yourself under the legislation of
[3:10:28.960 --> 3:10:33.360]  somebody else but Russell this is Bob they see I I'm trying to understand you
[3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:36.000]  know when they come up with stuff like this they always have some ostensible
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:40.040]  reason why it's wonderful and good what is there what is how do they try to sell
[3:10:40.040 --> 3:10:45.760]  this garbage okay the reasons that they gave for this was that it would raise
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:51.480]  more money for them which they feel they are cash strapped the fact of the
[3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:57.520]  matter is they are amongst the very richest of any wildlife management
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:02.240]  agency in the nation basically it's just a money grab they just want to get some
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:05.280]  more money and take more control of your land that's their excuse that's also a
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:09.720]  power grab it's a power grab and money grab both right now but figures that's
[3:11:09.720 --> 3:11:16.440]  exactly right and the the money part they are today they're the largest single
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:23.920]  landowner in the state of Missouri they have 2300 employees they're hardly a
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:31.440]  pauper group we have here they got but they were able to get a constitutional
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:39.240]  amendment passed wherein they get a one-eighth cent sales tax forever there
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:43.680]  is no ending on it there is no control over by the legislature it goes directly
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:48.880]  to them so basically you're you're the milk cow and they're the milka machine
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:55.920]  and they want to put more stringent regulations on it this the one thing
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:00.000]  they're hanging on now they you know they backed off on the rest of it but on
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:05.920]  this one thing of they want us to register our property now you know that
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:11.560]  that will be farming in nexus with them once you give them your legal
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:17.640]  description and sign up so you can get this free permit to cut on your own
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:23.120]  property you know the language of that is so offensive they say that they will
[3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:32.160]  issue a privilege issue you a privilege we on the land why do we have to have a
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:37.520]  state agency give us a privilege it's exactly right it's your land you know
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:42.280]  constitution says you have the right to life liberty and happiness it is your
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:45.040]  property you should be able to do what you want there you're not breaking any
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:47.840]  laws but what they want to do is they want to put you under some type of
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:50.960]  legislation they want some more money from you and really I think they also
[3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:54.720]  want a description of your land Bob I think you know they'd like to have the
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:12:58.240]  lay of your land and say oh well it looks like you've been under reporting on
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:01.520]  your taxes here your land's worth a little bit more so I think we're gonna
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:05.760]  juice you a little bit harder on the IRS this is really multifaceted how do
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:10.800]  people help you Russell how can the listeners get involved they the
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:16.800]  contacts that were made directly to the Department of Conservation was a big big
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:23.480]  help in this you know like I said they said they got contacts from 10,000
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:30.320]  people this goes back to you know we hear so often that well it's a federal
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:35.920]  law well it's a state law nothing we can do about it that isn't true you know
[3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:42.120]  we're still governed by the consent of the governed and if we give away these
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:47.120]  rights and these privileges then of course there are always those agencies
[3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:52.800]  and their friends and them non-governmental agencies that want to
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:58.960]  control our land they don't necessarily so much want to own it they don't have
[3:13:58.960 --> 3:14:05.600]  to if they can control it and let us be out the expense and and responsibility
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:13.640]  for the land but there seems to be no no end to this but but we don't have to
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:20.080]  give away these rights and privileges and they cannot necessarily take them
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:26.000]  unless we do cooperate with them and that's why they're asking for your
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:29.480]  consent on this forum and even if it's not a monetary value like you said they
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:34.760]  would be willing to give permits for free to these landowners of what is it
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:39.600]  five acres or around there but yeah yeah they want to get under you under
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:43.720]  control and you know this is just another infringement on personal freedoms
[3:14:43.720 --> 3:14:48.200]  and liberty and the state coming into control your land it's just it's just
[3:14:48.200 --> 3:14:52.040]  deplorable don't you think Bob oh look I understand I don't want to control your
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:54.800]  land they want to control the animals that you have on your land with these
[3:14:54.800 --> 3:15:00.560]  national animal identification system nonsense I mean I also have heard and
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:06.440]  this is not a joke that of course globally they want a cow fart tax on
[3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:11.720]  every cow that you have a message this for global warming you have to have you
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:14.720]  know you count your cows and you say okay how many cows you have times how many
[3:15:14.720 --> 3:15:18.400]  times that they fart every every day times how many days a year times how much
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:22.080]  methane divided by the coefficient of seven or whatever it certainly seems
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:26.120]  with the new administration's gonna do this there they're climate czar or
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:32.400]  global warming czar is Carol M. Browner of the Sustainable World Society which
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:36.080]  is calling for global governance and of course she's there to address the
[3:15:36.080 --> 3:15:40.400]  economy and climate change perhaps she's the one to promote the carbon tax yeah
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:44.600]  well why not I mean it's all about control it's all about destroying
[3:15:44.600 --> 3:15:48.680]  private property right it's all about destroying the middle class you know it's
[3:15:48.680 --> 3:15:52.320]  basically it's it's kind of car me don't you think oh absolutely so aside from
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:55.840]  writing these people letters and calling their office what can people do
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:16:01.320]  Russell let me go back to on what you were just saying about the the nice
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:06.640]  national animal identification system we've been very very much involved with
[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:13.760]  that we consider that to be a gross infringement on private property rights
[3:16:13.760 --> 3:16:19.640]  and we've we've really been battling that and you know we got it we got a law
[3:16:19.640 --> 3:16:27.200]  passed here in Missouri to prevent to prevent mandatory premise registration
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:33.480]  but of course USDA is trying to circumvent that and keep coming up with
[3:16:33.480 --> 3:16:40.840]  ways to give it in there anyway but there's much suspicion here and I could
[3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:46.600]  now I would not be able to document it but there's much suspicion that this
[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:53.320]  land registration with the Department of Conservation could very well be tied in
[3:16:53.320 --> 3:17:02.360]  to the USDA's premise registration for the NACE program you know USDA does pay
[3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:08.440]  a bounty they enter into these agreements with various organizations that if
[3:17:08.440 --> 3:17:14.280]  you'll go out here and get premise registrations for you why we'll give you
[3:17:14.280 --> 3:17:19.240]  so much money so we don't know that to be a fact but every time it's mentioned
[3:17:19.240 --> 3:17:24.680]  that's first thing it's brought up aha it's the NACE you know well maybe it is
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:29.880]  maybe it is but it's the same type of thing they want to get you they want to
[3:17:29.880 --> 3:17:34.520]  get a a nexus formed with your property or you can put that in the category I
[3:17:34.520 --> 3:17:42.440]  wouldn't wouldn't put it past them certainly can so how do we how do we
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:47.160]  take these guys on I mean these are the authorities they're the ones telling us
[3:17:47.160 --> 3:17:49.920]  that they have all the power that's not the case this is supposed to be a
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:55.200]  government for and by the people so how do we take that power back we work we
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:18:03.400]  work quite closely with our government of our county government every county has
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:11.200]  some sort of commission that runs a county and these are very much overlooked
[3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:17.400]  entities that have a lot more power than you know they've been in our area they
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:22.400]  used to be thought of just as sort of road district to maintain the roads and
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:31.360]  that's about it but by this handing out of our own tax money back to us through
[3:18:31.360 --> 3:18:37.080]  governmental agencies it serves the power of so many of us so much of our
[3:18:37.080 --> 3:18:45.040]  local government and by working with these people and trying to point out
[3:18:45.040 --> 3:18:50.160]  that it's not worth getting that money back from them because of the strings
[3:18:50.160 --> 3:18:56.160]  attached and all of the requirements that you know that money's never free we
[3:18:56.160 --> 3:19:01.400]  send it to them they send it back with conditions attached we send them with
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:11.240]  no conditions except they're spending we also work really well with our state
[3:19:11.240 --> 3:19:18.440]  legislators and you can always find some representatives or senators that will
[3:19:18.440 --> 3:19:27.280]  listen I think I heard one of our senators stated quite clearly when he
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:32.680]  was telling some of his fellow legislators he said when you have a
[3:19:32.680 --> 3:19:40.200]  group in your district that can call a meeting and four or five hundred people
[3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:45.960]  show up he said you better listen and that's why the power is in the people
[3:19:45.960 --> 3:19:50.760]  and we need to get together we need to form in mass this is the Alex Jones

[3:21:08.160 --> 3:21:11.920]  however is how this directly affects your personal finances is there a way to
[3:21:11.920 --> 3:21:15.600]  prevent your portfolios from losing value the answer to all of this is gold and
[3:21:15.600 --> 3:21:19.880]  silver they've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years if you
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:26.360]  had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept
[3:21:26.360 --> 3:21:30.080]  them both until now your cash would actually have the buying power of only
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:34.800]  $4,800 but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million

[3:24:56.840 --> 3:25:03.200]  that's it all right Russell finish up one just your last point why you're
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:10.600]  doing this and why people should help we're doing this as a continued work in
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:16.600]  our preserving our property rights and let me say that there is no substitute
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:22.720]  for personal involvement in these issues we might wish in an ideal world that we
[3:25:22.720 --> 3:25:28.480]  didn't have to spend our time energy and money protecting our rights but in the
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:33.520]  real world that's exactly what we have to do no one's going to do it for us we
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:41.200]  had an example here in Missouri of legislation that was passed by a naive
[3:25:41.200 --> 3:25:46.320]  uninformed legislature that thought they were doing the right thing they had
[3:25:46.320 --> 3:25:51.600]  no reason to believe it was anything onerous about it and we didn't weren't
[3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:57.320]  even aware of it until it become law and we got a we got involved with it got
[3:25:57.320 --> 3:26:04.120]  the thing changed to public involvement if you have to get out there and have
[3:26:04.120 --> 3:26:09.400]  meetings have them you know invite the legislators to come and listen to what
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:15.680]  do you have to say in our meetings it may sound rather crude but what we tell
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:21.200]  our legislators is it's more important that you listen to us than that you give
[3:26:21.200 --> 3:26:29.200]  us a speech and they accept that and they are after they get over the you know
[3:26:29.200 --> 3:26:33.440]  that's not usually the way they're greeted but they appreciate it because
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:38.040]  they want to know what the people want the legislators are not all crooks
[3:26:38.040 --> 3:26:43.000]  they're good people that are trying to do the best they can but unless you
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  contact them and let them know all they hear from is the other side so we have
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:54.680]  to be involved clear up to our eyebrows and and it may get to be a chore but but
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:26:58.960]  that's what we have to do all right thank you so much for joining us we're
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:01.840]  gonna take your calls in the next segment before we do I wanted to go to
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:07.440]  this video I forgot to mention it earlier we did a little 9-11 news they're
[3:27:07.440 --> 3:27:12.280]  releasing the transcripts of many of their interviews I don't know if they're
[3:27:12.280 --> 3:27:16.080]  all there but there's over a thousand there I think some like 1400 Daniel
[3:27:16.080 --> 3:27:23.840]  Sunjata our good friend in a 9-11 truth who is on rescue me he was a Reggie
[3:27:23.840 --> 3:27:27.840]  Jackson in the Bronx is burning he's been in some some major motion pictures
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:33.760]  his character Franco which is on the popular TV program rescue me on FX
[3:27:33.760 --> 3:27:39.080]  started talking a little 9-11 truth skiing hutch in episode 2 we knew this
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:42.200]  was going to happen because Dennis Leary said that it was going to be one of the
[3:27:42.200 --> 3:27:48.640]  subplots so let's take it away yeah for me you're not gonna have from anybody
[3:27:48.640 --> 3:27:58.160]  else because my opinions well let's just say they're not popular 9-11 inside
[3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:02.240]  job plain and simple all you got to do is connect the dots and I'm not talking
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:05.880]  about the dots everyone's already heard about I'm not talking about Bush sitting
[3:28:05.880 --> 3:28:09.120]  in that school reading a book about a goat to those kids for seven and a half
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:15.480]  minutes after he was told the nose everybody knows that I am talking about
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:19.640]  a massive neo-conservative government effort it's been in the works for over
[3:28:19.640 --> 3:28:26.960]  20 years you ever hear a PNAC project for a new American century perhaps yeah well
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:31.040]  according to them the end goal of their effort is American global domination full
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:34.880]  spectrum dominance they call it now the first question that pops to my mind is
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:38.000]  how do you pull that off in this day and age well according to them you do it in
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:42.160]  four steps first we must control the world's oil especially the oil and
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:45.200]  central Asia in the Middle East now I don't have to remind you that Bush Cheney
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:49.160]  they came to power with plans already made to attack Afghanistan and Iraq number
[3:28:49.160 --> 3:28:53.000]  two we have to make huge technological advances with our armed forces that for
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:56.600]  some reason include the capability to fight wars from out of space number three
[3:28:56.600 --> 3:29:00.640]  surprise surprise huge increases in military spending to pay for the above
[3:29:00.640 --> 3:29:04.840]  130 billion dollars a year worth now never mind the sick and dying first
[3:29:04.840 --> 3:29:08.440]  respond as 9-11's heroes who can't even pay their light bill let alone their
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:12.040]  medical bills and a lot of whom ended up homeless because of it I guess it's just
[3:29:12.040 --> 3:29:15.880]  not enough room in the budget for them number four and this is key we change
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:20.240]  the definition of preemptive attack so we can unilaterally bomb the shit out of
[3:29:20.240 --> 3:29:24.040]  invade and occupy countries even if they pose no credible threat or had nothing
[3:29:24.040 --> 3:29:28.440]  to do with 9-11 one problem how you gonna put it into action I mean the
[3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:31.960]  American people never gonna go for no shit like that right damn straight

[3:35:03.080 --> 3:35:06.120]  play this clip now I noticed this in the news a couple weeks ago people were
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:11.120]  talking about texting and how a lot of teenagers are texting each other with
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:14.560]  naked pics of one another it's kid stuff I mean even when I was a younger guy
[3:35:14.560 --> 3:35:19.000]  and the internet wasn't that big you know kids are scandalous young people
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:22.640]  are scandalous you when you're in high school you do some crazy things but now
[3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:27.280]  apparently they want to charge some some of these kids with pictures that are
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:31.600]  quote-unquote child porn no these are their teenage girlfriends sending them
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:36.160]  that but they just ruled the day before yesterday that 18 year olds were allowed
[3:35:36.160 --> 3:35:39.360]  to have sex with their high school teachers seems a little twisted to me
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:45.520]  Bob let's play the CNN clip here comes out of sending naked pictures of
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:49.320]  yourself to your sweetheart on the cell phone they call it sexting great they
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:35:53.840]  got a name for it and now six high school kids are facing child porn charges
[3:35:53.840 --> 3:35:57.480]  because of it police in Greensburg Pennsylvania say three teen girls sent
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:02.400]  naked cell phone pictures to three male classmates yes they should be punished
[3:36:02.400 --> 3:36:05.760]  the question child porn charges is that the way to go we're taking your calls
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:09.600]  one eight seven seven tell HL and joining me now former sex crimes
[3:36:09.600 --> 3:36:14.680]  prosecutor Wendy Murphy also with a sexuality educator sorry locker all
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:18.080]  right Wendy let's start with you child porn charges is that really the way to
[3:36:18.080 --> 3:36:23.120]  go here you know it does sound heavy I have to say on the other hand there
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:27.080]  really isn't anything else to charge so if you have nothing else and you want
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:30.560]  to stop the behavior you use what you can't they're not gonna go to jail they're
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:33.920]  not gonna become listed sex offenders I guarantee this will be a plea deal no
[3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:40.400]  I guarantee that if they do they will be a child this is not a game this is
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:45.760]  serious business and number one adults in the real child porn business will hunt
[3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:49.920]  you down and take advantage if they find these pictures and they will the other
[3:36:49.920 --> 3:36:55.640]  thing is keep in mind if you think as an adult child porn maker that you can use
[3:36:55.640 --> 3:36:59.840]  kids to do this stuff with impunity you're gonna use them as your all right
[3:36:59.840 --> 3:37:03.640]  let's cut away Scott free this is unbelievable to me they're trying to
[3:37:03.640 --> 3:37:07.440]  associate this with child pornographers isn't that not these are 16 and 17 year
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:11.600]  old kids well I think that the 16 and 17 year old kids shouldn't be doing that
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:15.320]  yeah I'm not applauding the behavior how you know because that shows some of
[3:37:15.320 --> 3:37:21.080]  them you know just the moral decay in the country everything like that but that
[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:26.480]  you try to turn this into a federal case you know that they're using that as an
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:30.640]  excuse and I'm sure they'll use that as an excuse to go after everything you
[3:37:30.640 --> 3:37:35.600]  know go after the internet go after cell phone usage go after whatever it's
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:39.560]  always for the children that is patently ridiculous absolutely patently
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:43.240]  ridiculous all right we have a long tradition in the show of going to those
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:47.880]  who disagree with us first so that's why we're going to go to Dan in Texas first
[3:37:47.880 --> 3:37:52.880]  Dan was on your mind hey I just wanted to get on the air to make a comment before
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:57.360]  you guys get all excited about rescue we have a 9-11 plot I'm just reading a
[3:37:57.360 --> 3:38:00.960]  press release from Dennis Leary here who said they had to get some subplot lines
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:05.280]  out of the way first yeah yeah I know that so I think that he thinks it's a
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:09.600]  bunch of BS and I just wanted to say you guys report nothing but hoaxes and
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:16.280]  you're nuttier than school that's great let's get rid of him now that we
[3:38:16.280 --> 3:38:19.280]  report about hoaxes I think we just hoaxes we just report that they're
[3:38:19.280 --> 3:38:22.800]  going to charge kids with child porn for texting but that that's a report that's
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:28.320]  a hoax it's a hoax that he that Obama has a global warmings are coming on
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:31.440]  that's for global government that's a hoax at the head of the CFR is going to
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:36.640]  be as foreign policy that is definitely a hoax also it's also a hoax that why
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:40.400]  doesn't so many people think alike well because their brainwash must like Dan
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:44.680]  in Texas friends Texas quarter is a hoax and after superhighway is a hoax
[3:38:44.680 --> 3:38:50.880]  everything is a hoax yeah go back to your didn't go on CNBC this week and
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:55.240]  basically call for a new world order on Obama he never did that guy hasn't seen
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:38:58.600]  enough American out he needs to watch American Idol 24 and you know what the
[3:38:58.600 --> 3:39:02.680]  new cover of the special edition of Newsweek if we can zoom in on that
[3:39:02.680 --> 3:39:07.600]  that's not Barack Obama on the new global elite in the middle of Moloch
[3:39:07.600 --> 3:39:10.660]  that's not now that's not what that is those are not allies and that's not a
[3:39:10.660 --> 3:39:20.480]  beat all right let's jump to Wilson in Michigan Wilson what's on your mind
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:25.000]  hey Jason thanks for taking my call I'm a first-time caller I've been listening
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:29.240]  for about a year the reason I'm calling is because I'd like to bring people's
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:33.440]  attention to the larger picture here I think a lot of times people get lost in
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:37.480]  the semantics of all this person's member of the CFR the tri-lateral
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:41.440]  commission if you understand history you really look at it you can see that what
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:43.960]  we're facing real enemy is the British Empire
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:49.400]  for a lot it's about sovereign nation-states against the system of
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:53.160]  empire and I think what we really need to do is focus on how to fight that
[3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:56.920]  system not just the individual people and members of whatever group I'll say
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:39:59.960]  this there's definitely some truth to what you're saying in that the British
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:04.480]  oligarchy still controls a lot of the monetary system and a lot of the actual
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:08.800]  infrastructure in not only this country but Europe and around the world and in
[3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:12.960]  addition to that in addition to that guys you know what you think about it
[3:40:12.960 --> 3:40:17.320]  this thing about Barack Obama were if he was born in Kenya that was British
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:21.680]  Zanzibar back when he was born there so it very well could be that the redcoats
[3:40:21.680 --> 3:40:25.280]  have taken the country back over again effective on the 20th well I think that
[3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:28.960]  this is an international crime syndicate anyway and that's why you know in
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:32.080]  fabled enemies I go over the International Intelligence Organization I
[3:40:32.080 --> 3:40:36.200]  think that we talk about the CFR and the trilats because those are outward
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:39.760]  think-type type organizations that people can relate to and that are in the
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:42.960]  mainstream media but obvious they were created by the British Empire yeah I
[3:40:42.960 --> 3:40:46.440]  know the strings go further I'm with you there man hey I encourage people to go
[3:40:46.440 --> 3:40:49.960]  check out you know all the riddles and stone movies are pretty good the last
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:53.000]  one that I watched or the second one what would not rules and stone movies
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:56.200]  what are the American secret beginnings and riddles and stone is the second one
[3:40:56.200 --> 3:40:59.360]  it really goes over how British influence is still around I thank you for
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:03.760]  the call we got a ton of callers let's go to Kurt in Colorado Kurt what's on your
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:10.480]  mind hello I'd like to thank you for taking my call thank you guys for
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:17.000]  getting the true facts out there for people I think there's a lot of blind
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:23.400]  ignorant people out there but I think you're reaching some up and I just wanted
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:29.320]  to say when I was 18 years old it was law that you had to go register for
[3:41:29.320 --> 3:41:36.760]  selective service in which I did on my 18th birthday proudly and the funny
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:42.160]  thing about it is though as I swore on a Bible and swore to God to uphold the
[3:41:42.160 --> 3:41:49.760]  Constitution no matter what the cost and what in which I'll do and I just
[3:41:49.760 --> 3:41:55.600]  wondered if he knew when selective service stopped or no I mean they still
[3:41:55.600 --> 3:42:00.520]  as 18 I also had to sign over my paper in fact they make it a kind of fun thing
[3:42:00.520 --> 3:42:04.000]  in high school for us the other like oh and you can also register to vote while
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:07.560]  you do this so you're registering for selective service and devoted puts you
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:11.720]  into a database in case that they ever do call up conscription or the draft so
[3:42:11.720 --> 3:42:14.960]  that you're immediately put into there and they don't have to just you know
[3:42:14.960 --> 3:42:18.800]  start that program again so you're already in the program you sound a little
[3:42:18.800 --> 3:42:22.680]  older than me so you're probably out of it since conscription is really 18 to 25
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:26.120]  but 27 year olds may be considered in the right situation who knows maybe
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:29.880]  they'll pull up to 30 all right let's jump to the next caller let's go to John
[3:42:29.880 --> 3:42:35.320]  in Washington John what's on your mind hey Jason how are you guys doing good
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:42.720]  man mr. cook I believe that was his name Russell cook yes seems like a very
[3:42:42.720 --> 3:42:48.720]  smart nice man and but I think he's missing the bigger picture I'd like to
[3:42:48.720 --> 3:42:52.640]  read something very short for you and hit one nail on the head and then I want to
[3:42:52.640 --> 3:42:57.440]  touch on one other thing briefly okay sustainable development is a plan for
[3:42:57.440 --> 3:43:01.040]  global control using land resource restrictions social transformation
[3:43:01.040 --> 3:43:05.920]  through education and other programs to accomplish this end the land use element
[3:43:05.920 --> 3:43:09.440]  of sustainable development calls for the implementation of two action plans
[3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:13.800]  designed to eliminate private property the wildlands project and smart growth
[3:43:13.800 --> 3:43:18.080]  what he's actually a victim of and his and the people in his state are the
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:24.160]  victim of is the rewilding or wild wildlands project because it is a
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:29.880]  compartmentalization and it is a very difficult task and what they're trying
[3:43:29.880 --> 3:43:34.560]  to do is trick those people into registering their land and doing the
[3:43:34.560 --> 3:43:40.200]  first half of the job for them later on that land will be off limits I'm looking
[3:43:40.200 --> 3:43:46.720]  at the map of the wildlands project and in his state about half of his state is
[3:43:46.720 --> 3:43:53.160]  red red is off limits the other part is yellow and that is the buffer zone for
[3:43:53.160 --> 3:43:56.880]  the off-limit zone so I think maybe he needs to chase that rabbit for a little
[3:43:56.880 --> 3:44:00.760]  while and see what happens because if he brings this to the front and accuses
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:06.120]  them as I have done here in Washington then then he will get some additional
[3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:10.280]  attention and they'll realize that they're even more awake second nail I'd
[3:44:10.280 --> 3:44:14.240]  like to strike is that moron that called you a little bit earlier and jumped
[3:44:14.240 --> 3:44:19.840]  your bones about being a profiteer I am so sick and tired of these phony
[3:44:19.840 --> 3:44:25.200]  patriots and their socialist mentality most of them are stinky smelly old men
[3:44:25.200 --> 3:44:30.080]  who sit around and blabber and talk everything to death and when you come
[3:44:30.080 --> 3:44:33.400]  right down to it if you get to know them they're taking checks from the
[3:44:33.400 --> 3:44:38.640]  government for unemployment for SSI L&I whatever you you know that they're
[3:44:38.640 --> 3:44:42.480]  they're usually on the dole and that's why they have so much time to sit around
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:47.440]  and bump their gums I'd like to say to this man a quote from the speech John
[3:44:47.440 --> 3:44:52.520]  Galt and the book Atlas shrugged it says that you demand your wages but denies
[3:44:52.520 --> 3:45:00.760]  our profits may you be damned and little do you know you are great caller thank
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:04.120]  you thank you so much it and John sometimes the truth hurts it's the
[3:45:04.120 --> 3:45:08.560]  truth man listen we've got to make a living here out I mean I guess I could
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:12.440]  go back to flippin pies but I won't be on the radio and then I'll just be making
[3:45:12.440 --> 3:45:16.760]  your pizza you know I mean you can get a job at NPR and have the taxpayers pay
[3:45:16.760 --> 3:45:20.240]  for you to tell the truth maybe I should call up in Air America and be somebody's
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:23.760]  coffee boy that's what I should do yeah really maybe I get to guess like ten
[3:45:23.760 --> 3:45:26.360]  minutes a week when that when that when that caller said that about you I'm
[3:45:26.360 --> 3:45:31.240]  thinking you know you guys a few years ago when you did loose change yeah you
[3:45:31.240 --> 3:45:38.080]  were sitting out there passing out free DVDs by the gross by the thousands to
[3:45:38.080 --> 3:45:43.200]  everybody would take one shame on yeah how dare I dare you all right let's go
[3:45:43.200 --> 3:45:47.680]  our next caller let's go to Raymond in Oregon Raymond what's on your mind
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:54.520]  hey Jason how's it going good man hey um I was calling about your officer jack
[3:45:54.520 --> 3:46:00.080]  uh... cameras last night yeah right Jack McClellan he was in the military and
[3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:03.920]  I'm currently in the Oregon National Guard and we're getting ready to go to
[3:46:03.920 --> 3:46:10.040]  Iraq for ten months cheese well yeah well recently I had the opportunity to go
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:17.720]  up to our military command in Oregon and speak with a individual about some
[3:46:17.720 --> 3:46:21.400]  problems I'm having in the military and I during the course of events I brought
[3:46:21.400 --> 3:46:26.520]  up the fact that I swore an oath to uphold defend the Constitution and he
[3:46:26.520 --> 3:46:30.600]  also came up with something saying that okay well you also swore to uphold to
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:35.000]  order obey the orders of the president of the United States and I pointed out
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:40.320]  the fact to him that my oh says so obey the orders of the president in accordance
[3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:44.560]  with law I pointed out the Constitution is the supreme law of the land
[3:46:44.560 --> 3:46:49.400]  anything that violates the Constitution any orders obviously unconstitutional
[3:46:49.400 --> 3:46:56.000]  and this guy was a lawyer okay he told me that yeah he told me that the law was
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:47:02.960]  there to go around it to be in yeah it's always it's the circumvent your
[3:47:02.960 --> 3:47:06.720]  constitutional rights and the circumvent the circumvent the bill of
[3:47:06.720 --> 3:47:10.720]  rights it always is that way it's always to try to put you under a new mode of
[3:47:10.720 --> 3:47:15.560]  control continue exactly so I told him I don't want to be in the military because
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:19.680]  it was a violation of not only my oath but the Constitution and he wrote all
[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:23.120]  this down it's supposed to go to the adjunct general the state of Oregon but
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:27.520]  the fact of the matter is that it's just there's a lot of people in the military
[3:47:27.520 --> 3:47:31.160]  that are that are beginning to understand what exactly is going on and I'm
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:36.320]  working within my own unit to wake people up I've woken out 10 or 15 people in my
[3:47:36.320 --> 3:47:39.800]  unit up to the truth of what's going on but it's just so difficult with people
[3:47:39.800 --> 3:47:44.800]  like this lawyer who believe that the Constitution is is not the law and that
[3:47:44.800 --> 3:47:49.280]  the president's infallible can do it every once it's absolutely stunning but
[3:47:49.280 --> 3:47:52.600]  that is the mentality that's the mentality we've all grown up with the
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:47:55.600]  commander-in-chief you should be so honored you know it's like I had my
[3:47:55.600 --> 3:47:59.960]  governor on yesterday and the governor and for conscription said well I hope
[3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:04.360]  that if another hitler arose in the world that the people of this country
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:07.680]  would want to have conscription so that we could rise up and fight that leader
[3:48:07.680 --> 3:48:11.240]  and I thought to myself well in actuality Hitler never really lost
[3:48:11.240 --> 3:48:16.600]  because the people behind him kept power we relegated the top Nazis into our
[3:48:16.600 --> 3:48:21.360]  scientific programs through project paper paperclip not just our NASA program
[3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:24.600]  which was born out of the Nazis but our eugenics programs as well they were just
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:31.520]  put under wraps so in reality that that threat has never left and you know the
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:35.560]  Constitution Bill of Rights is supposed to protect us from those and the
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:38.880]  reason the lawyers I hope I don't make any lawyers mad I don't really care if I
[3:48:38.880 --> 3:48:42.840]  do or not but the reason the lawyers say that that they still you just get
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:46.080]  around it is because they don't understand the Constitution they were
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:51.640]  taught in law school that Marbury versus Madison means that the only people who
[3:48:51.640 --> 3:48:55.800]  can understand the Constitution is is the Supreme Court and whatever they say
[3:48:55.800 --> 3:49:01.160]  goes Constitution be be darned I mean they think that the Supreme Court is
[3:49:01.160 --> 3:49:05.360]  is the living end of everything they're taught that from day one in law school but
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:08.960]  they forgot to read the part in article I think it's three section two which says
[3:49:08.960 --> 3:49:13.320]  that the Congress has the power to limit the appellate jurisdiction of Supreme
[3:49:13.320 --> 3:49:17.480]  Court none of them know this although it's in the Constitution so the founding
[3:49:17.480 --> 3:49:21.760]  fathers never intended the Supreme Court to be the arbiters of what the
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:24.760]  Constitution means the things written in English you can read it for yourself
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:28.640]  that's why lawyers don't get it all right let's go to another Oregon caller
[3:49:28.640 --> 3:49:34.080]  let's go to Henry in Oregon Henry what's on your mind doing Jason I'm doing
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:38.320]  good man how you doing all pretty good I've been listening to you this week and
[3:49:38.320 --> 3:49:44.440]  I'd like to hear you talk I listened to you earlier and you were speaking about
[3:49:44.440 --> 3:49:50.320]  going to the legislatures and the county commissioners and I think you're just
[3:49:50.320 --> 3:49:54.920]  a little out of touch there you know this government as it is is 210%
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:49:59.200]  corrupt from the meter made to the president well when I was saying we
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:02.600]  have to run for those positions not so much go and beg for our rights from them
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:06.400]  but when that guy was calling up and saying that civil disobedience wasn't
[3:50:06.400 --> 3:50:10.800]  the only way we all said to run for these positions I agreed yeah I agree with
[3:50:10.800 --> 3:50:14.600]  you there too I ran for mayor in the town I meant and it was a victim of
[3:50:14.600 --> 3:50:20.600]  voter fraud had proof of it reporter came over from Medford and reported on it
[3:50:20.600 --> 3:50:25.720]  and her report was dunked and she went to Connecticut and there was never
[3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:29.960]  nothing that could be done about it these people are all in it together and
[3:50:29.960 --> 3:50:36.160]  you don't get up to a position of power without becoming corrupt and I don't
[3:50:36.160 --> 3:50:40.120]  know what the answer is to defeating this people but I know it isn't going to
[3:50:40.120 --> 3:50:45.680]  the people who are oppressing you and and that's trying to stop well I agree I
[3:50:45.680 --> 3:50:48.520]  don't think we should be begging our oppressors for our God-given rights it's

[3:56:14.120 --> 3:56:16.880]  that that gives me that's very heartening towards me because we just have a
[3:56:16.880 --> 3:56:20.320]  call it don't go to the legislative listen I'm not saying beg for your rights
[3:56:20.320 --> 3:56:24.200]  from these people but when they first ask them and then or he's really not
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:28.320]  asking them and say what you want and yeah you demand your right and then when
[3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:32.200]  they say no no no no no no then run against them take them and then give
[3:56:32.200 --> 3:56:36.080]  all those other people that are were in your situation only months or years ago
[3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:39.480]  their rights back I mean that's how we're gonna take it over I mean it's it's
[3:56:39.480 --> 3:56:43.840]  slowly but surely it's people like you and yourself your brother taking charge
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:47.200]  running for office and really trying to take back the Constitution Bill writes
[3:56:47.200 --> 3:56:53.240]  John Jason and you know essentially at the end of the day we have to stop
[3:56:53.240 --> 3:56:59.480]  referring to things as privileges most things are rights most things there were
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:05.800]  certain things that could be legally perceived even on an idealistic sense
[3:57:05.800 --> 3:57:08.880]  you could say okay well there they could be can you have perceived as
[3:57:08.880 --> 3:57:11.960]  privileges but these are all rights they'll they'll they'll refer to as a
[3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:16.760]  license now I'm a cop for 15 years you know these are these are privileges
[3:57:16.760 --> 3:57:22.240]  having a way to drive a car is not a privilege it's your right you can go
