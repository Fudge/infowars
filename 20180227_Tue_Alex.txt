[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  Coming up in about five, six minutes, the president is scheduled to,
[00:25.000 --> 00:37.000]  coincidentally, only 14 months into his presidency, call for his re-election to be launched early, basically.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  He's going to announce his bid for the presidency for 2020, announce the campaign head here in the next few weeks,
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  and all the hype that comes with it, getting a jump on the globalist, a jump on the Republican establishment,
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  a jump on the Democrats. It's absolute genius because they're already running their campaign against Trump
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  and the American resurgence. We've got to stay in campaign mode.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  As I've been saying for weeks, the censorship crackdown you're seeing against libertarians, Christians,
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  pro-gun groups across the board, is in preparation for shutting down speech just for the midterms.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  And so we're going to have that announcement. He made one earlier, but I'm told another one's coming up.
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  So there's some confusion on that, but we will continue to break that down and play that here for you,
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  all the different statements that are being made. Reportedly, he's going to also make some other statements later.
[01:31.000 --> 01:41.000]  So we'll track that as that unfolds. There is a formulaic move to legitimize communist Chinese-style censorship here in America,
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.000]  and that is now taking place. That is now unfolding. YouTube, after CNN filed the complaint,
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  took down some of our videos last week and gave us strikes on basically all of our channels.
[01:56.000 --> 02:03.000]  Now, on the big one, with over 2 billion views on one channel alone, it was also false what they even claimed.
[02:03.000 --> 02:12.000]  What they said, we didn't even say. They've done it again with other videos where we specifically say that they were not child actors,
[02:12.000 --> 02:22.000]  not crisis actors. And so they've frozen streaming and uploading. There'll be no more videos for the next two weeks,
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  reportedly, on the site. It'll be gone before then. And like I said, I've been looking at the right lawsuits and things,
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  and so we've got the lawyers lined up and we'll be having to file suits here very, very soon.
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  There's also some statute of limitation issues. But we're showing you the last banned videos so you can actually see what we're saying is true
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  because we have those on the computers where they were uploaded, the exact same files.
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.000]  We're uploading now those files to our own servers to show you the two new videos that were banned as well on the Alex Jones channel.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  I don't want to be clear. Dr. Corsi has a very popular YouTube site with hundreds of millions of views,
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  and he works for him Full Wars, but he's had his side for years. He's the number one New York Times bestselling author three times over.
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  He did a video about Trump's going to counter strike the globalists this year legally through the system.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  And we talked about top Democrats. Of course, he's not someone bullying anybody, but again, they can label it and they want bullying.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  They banned his video that 2018 Trump is going to counter strike against the deep state.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  So we'll be airing some of that video today. They don't want you to see as well.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  They are really scared of this broadcast because they know the military and people in government that are patriots are listening,
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  and it's really a clearinghouse of research and things that are unfolding.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  So we're going to be going over all that today, but this is a big deal.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  They think you're just going to go quietly the night. They think you're stupid.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  They think that you'll just get used to this and just accept it.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  But everything we've seen so far is like a parrot testing its perch.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  A parrot will lean out and touch its beak to a branch to see if it will hold its way.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  And so they've been testing and probing.
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  I mean, here's an example. The Chinese president is already a dictator.
[04:10.000 --> 04:21.000]  He's elected by the Communist Party and the Politburo, only a few hundred members of the permanent Communist Party that is a dictatorship of the Communist Party.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  But now he's just going to basically make himself king, which is where communism almost always goes like North Korea.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  So there's a little bit of inter-party fighting and they go, ooh, rare dissent.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  You never see it in China because they kill you if you do.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  It's members of the other arm of the Communist Party just saying this might cause chaos down the road.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  Of course, they'll probably be disappeared now.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  But that's who our media and who our government and who Apple officially announces they're relocating to China fully to be state run there,
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  taking the deal offered a month ago by the Chinese dictator of zero taxes.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  By the way, it's come out now that on the taxes, Amazon made 5.6 billion profit.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  Last year paid zero taxes.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.000]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[05:22.000 --> 05:33.000]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[05:43.000 --> 05:52.000]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[05:52.000 --> 06:14.000]  Try bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[06:22.000 --> 06:35.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:35.000 --> 06:43.000]  We're launching Operation Paul Revere 2018, kicking off Thursday at 8 a.m. with David Knight,
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  running right through to the end of the war room with Owen Shroyer the next day at 6 p.m.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  And of course I'll be right smack dab in the middle of it live and popping in throughout the live transmission.
[06:52.000 --> 07:06.000]  It is a defense of free speech, a defense of the First Amendment, a defense of the Second Amendment emergency transmission because the mass censorship is here.
[07:06.000 --> 07:15.000]  Now, Trump this morning in some tweets announced that he's going to be running for president in 2020.
[07:15.000 --> 07:24.000]  He's announcing early because the Democrats have already launched their campaign against free speech and against Trump and the Republican establishment is getting prepared in positions to do so as well.
[07:24.000 --> 07:34.000]  That way Trump can see who's going to endorse him ahead of the election so that he doesn't work with people like Romney and others and help them and then they turn around and stab him in the back.
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.000]  So this will force commitment by a lot of people and will let Trump get out ahead of all of this.
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  It is an absolutely genius idea and why he is our president.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  Trump announces reelection campaign.
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  Reportedly there's some type of announcement coming up, but they've been changing the times as they often do as things are fluid.
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.000]  So we'll watch that as the day unfolds.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  Of course, at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  Trump announces reelection campaign and campaign manager.
[08:07.000 --> 08:19.000]  President to Donald Trump announced that he is running for reelection 2020 and that Brad Parscale who served as Trump's campaign 2016 digital guru has been named campaign manager.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  I'll pronounce that right.
[08:21.000 --> 08:31.000]  In an announcement posted on the president's campaign website, his son Eric Trump praised the man he's appointing as an amazing talent who was pivotal to our success in 2016.
[08:31.000 --> 08:41.000]  Top Trump advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner said that Parscale was essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  The news was first reported by Matt Drudge, the Drudge report.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  So the president has already filed for reelection.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  He filed a form to paperwork with the federal election commission hours after he was inaugurated.
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  Over a year ago, he has also held a number of reelection campaign rallies already.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  So Drudge broke that.
[09:04.000 --> 09:13.000]  I've been a little distracted from that big announcement with this and what we said last Friday has been proven to be dead on.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  And again, the only place that carried it was drudgerport.com and infowars.com.
[09:19.000 --> 09:29.000]  That's a big deal because when CNN came out and said, I guess they covered it, the only other group that covered it to point out how horrible it was and said,
[09:29.000 --> 09:39.000]  we're going to, when we have file complaints against Alex Jones and we're looking to shut him down for saying there were no real people at the shooting and it was all crisis actors and the shooting didn't happen.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  Now they didn't show a quote.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  They didn't show a video.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.000]  They just lied.
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.000]  The videos they took down, we were able to host on our own server, got well over 7 million views.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  And you could see what was really in the videos.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  Eyewitnesses reporting a stand down.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Eyewitnesses reporting multiple gunmen.
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  Now we don't know if they were right at that time.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  We now know the stand down did happen.
[10:00.000 --> 10:09.000]  But the new videos are us saying clearly there were no crisis actors that he was called the truth about crisis actors.
[10:09.000 --> 10:21.000]  Explain yes, the four students the media has chosen out of 3000 put on the news are the friends of local drama club and it looks like they're putting scripted stuff out.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  But that doesn't mean that they don't go to that school.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  That was banned as bullying.
[10:29.000 --> 10:41.000]  And so was another one where we said SSRIs have been in every major mass shooting and that yet if you want to say one thing is the main cause it's that and media hyping up schools and that you're supposed to use AR 15 to do it.
[10:41.000 --> 10:50.000]  When AR 15 are used in less than 1% assault rifles less than 2% of overall gun crime FBI statistics, but almost all school shootings use them.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  So it's very suggestible people as it's this one gun it's this one thing and they know they put enough of it out in the media that that crazy people will get into this and do it.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  And then when the crazy people say they're going to do it nothing's done.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  So we went with the best evidence we had that the shooting did happen like they said and but now it's turned out there was a stand down.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  Drudgerport.com is linked to our article Parkland first responder.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  I was told to stand down.
[11:16.000 --> 11:28.000]  I could have saved lives and we've got teachers we've got students we've got students we've had on that said there were 10 police cars lined up while the shooting is going on and nothing went on.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Just bizarre.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  These are the videos.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  They don't say copyright.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  When we play a local newscast clip.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  They say bullying.
[11:42.000 --> 11:51.000]  And then they go on the news and David Hogg the main guy the four students mother see an employee dad.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  FBI agent.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  He goes on and they go boy they say you're a crisis after the shooting and happen.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  Well it's all right they've gotten me lots of traffic you know they're idiots and then they'll cut to.
[12:04.000 --> 12:15.000]  Dan rather and Glenn Beck and Stelter with Hogg in studio saying Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones shouldn't we ban Alex Jones the the pollution of Alex Jones.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  And a lot of people go OK Alex if you get banned big deal.
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.000]  Do you understand that they said two weeks before this in the Wall Street Journal that they met with Google that's news court did and others.
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  And they said we're going to call everything bullying we're going to ban him for worse first people may get behind it because he's a lightning rod and then we have the president to shut everything down.
[12:33.000 --> 12:43.000]  Within three days of them going in and putting freezing our live video feeds now our official YouTube channel the Alex Jones channel I should have announced this front is frozen.
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  No uploads one more strike it's gone and they're just making it look judicious.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  I predicted this Friday it'll be one and then another and then three well we warned Alex the headlines will be.
[12:55.000 --> 13:03.000]  Jones was warned and told to stop saying no kids died but he didn't you'll see that in every newspaper.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  And you would have heard the show you would have seen the videos you would have heard me never say that.
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  But you'll your friends and family if you tell them they'll say shut up because that's mind control.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  And so you can see how it's all scripted and then because they can't get me to talk bad about David Hogg.
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  And they know court case wise that we've got seeing and admitting that they got involved in our account the New York Times admitting they did it.
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  Hogg up there all of it that he can definitely be brought into the court case.
[13:32.000 --> 13:40.000]  So now he's positioning himself I'd say we're 2448 hours out from permanent banning.
[13:40.000 --> 13:48.000]  Two plus billion views thousands of incredible videos on health on on on life on science on the universe.
[13:48.000 --> 13:56.000]  On politics on sunsets on fireside chats just you name it it's on there.
[13:56.000 --> 14:05.000]  The Charlton Heston interview Noam Chomsky interview President Trump interview interviews all of it gone.
[14:05.000 --> 14:16.000]  A compendium of 12 years 13 years of work there going back videos of my French Bulldog and shawawa that are dead now playing in the yard.
[14:16.000 --> 14:25.000]  You go put your stuff on their cloud that's what YouTube is is a pre cloud you go there you you you give them billions and billions of views.
[14:25.000 --> 14:38.000]  And then they sit there and they lie about you and they roll out a teenager a young man a spokesman an activist and they say he's the bully Alex shows as the bully and then Mr. Hogg.
[14:38.000 --> 14:46.000]  Who's we've since challenged and he's not responded while he's still tweeting about us calls me a charlatan and someone sued.
[14:46.000 --> 14:57.000]  For saying Sandy Hook didn't happen that never happened that's just totally made up and that I'm basically a fat ugly person and a SH you know what T journalist.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  And that he wants to call my show.
[15:00.000 --> 15:07.000]  And then he chose pictures of me and it makes fun of me everything clearly trying to bait me.
[15:07.000 --> 15:16.000]  And we don't expect him to come on when we know that CNN's from research we've got involved advising him and the rest of it.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  And so that's just how it is to the young man 18 year old man.
[15:21.000 --> 15:32.000]  He can have us banned play the victim and then sit there on his Twitter to close to 300,000 or is it more more than 300,000 followers.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  And defame me and lie about me and say whatever he wants.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  So I want to have Mr. Hogg who challenges me.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  We've we've private message you you name it.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  We're waiting Mr. Hogg.

[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  And we're going to ask you the question.

[20:11.000 --> 20:26.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.000 --> 20:41.000]  I got bad news for you and I got bad news for you. President Trump's announcing he's running early to build up steam and momentum.
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.000]  And so that Republicans that are going to get behind him can be identified so they won't be able to stab him in the back.
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  Once the election really cranks up, it's a smart move.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  And I know Trump overall has done a lot of good things.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  The globalist has been trying to destroy him. The bad news is, as he's meeting with the nation's governors right now,
[20:57.000 --> 21:09.000]  Fox News is reporting pitching gun control, bump stock bands, and on top of that, raising the age to 18 to buy semi-automatic rifles.
[21:09.000 --> 21:17.000]  That sells the idea that banning things is how you stop crime or stop psychopaths or stop people on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[21:17.000 --> 21:24.000]  Every mass shooter has been on serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Everyone. And this guy included.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  Now, bump stocks really don't work and they're a crap product in my view.
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.000]  But still, still, you can't give the dog a bone because pretty soon you're giving them the whole cow.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  And that's the plan. There's always going to be mass shootings. There's always going to be crazy people.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  We take all the guns. We'll be in communist China where they execute millions of people every few years.
[21:45.000 --> 21:56.000]  I mean, but our media never humanizes the Chinese. So that said, that's a bad situation.
[21:56.000 --> 22:05.000]  Now, the really big news here is that thousands of YouTube channels of every prominent gun group you name it,
[22:05.000 --> 22:16.000]  veterans groups, hunting groups, shooting club groups from just duck hunting to you name it is all being banned.
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  And the way they do it is first, oh, this is a community guidelines strike.
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  We won't tell you what it is, but this 4-8 shooting club video is banned. That's one strike.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  Then, oh, your sights frozen, two strikes, and then they delete you.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  They make you feel like you did it. That's how I was able to say Friday.
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.000]  You know, they've done the one strike, the CNN's calling for, and then they'll do the second and freeze our channel.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  It's now frozen today. And then in a couple days, oh, and we found another one.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  Oh, look, and the media will say, oh, look, he didn't learn. And then it's not censorship.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  We just said that you were bullying children and said things you didn't say and then deleted you.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  And then the media doesn't announce it's a purge against everybody.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  They just say, oh, it's just against Alex Jones and the NRA.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  And all over David Hogg's Twitter, the main spokesperson, the senior, the young man,
[23:01.000 --> 23:07.000]  who's all over the news, a public figure, if you even talk about him, they delete your videos.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  The videos they deleted today were us saying we believe he is not a crisis actor.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  We believe he's been given lines and the other students have because out of four students,
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  you've got 3,000 others that weren't talked to, just like the fake CNN Town Hall that was scripted.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  That's a national issue. Tucker Carlson sounds just like me because what he's talking about is the same thing.
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  He isn't getting deleted, not yet, you see.
[23:30.000 --> 23:39.000]  So this is very dangerous. And so Dr. Corsi had his channel frozen today for a very milk toast video.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  There was no threats, no nothing. It was just how Trump's going to strike back against the globalists in 2018
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  and how he's going to use these different executive orders to go out through their offshore money.
[23:49.000 --> 23:57.000]  Now these big corporations pay zero taxes. We've got Amazon made 5.6 billion in profits last year,
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  paid zero in federal taxes.
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  Silicon Valley faces perfect storm of public contempt for all their censorship and control.
[24:09.000 --> 24:18.000]  So here we are. They've got a big PR campaign run by CNN to ban info wars.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  And they even say we're going to ban everybody, but that's the cover.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  Oh, they did that. All the conservatives are gone because they're bullies.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  They don't show how we were a bully. And then Dana Lohsch and others get up and they say,
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  murderer, we're going to kill you. We're going to burn you. That's cute. That's funny.
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.000]  You see? And hashtag hunt Republicans and kill the NRA billboards. They all stay up.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  It's amazing.
[24:42.000 --> 24:53.000]  So continuing, David Hogg has come out today and called me a piece of, you know what?
[24:53.000 --> 25:01.000]  A SH, you know what? T journalist who is an idiot.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  He says, I got sued for lies about survivors and victims of another school shooting,
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  which is a violence policy center Brady campaign lie.
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  So they just, they just keep saying that all because I said that I couldn't prove
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  them where the other people died there.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  And my own listeners got mad at me saying it was a hoax.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  They just think because I'm fair and balanced about things that I must be weak on it.
[25:24.000 --> 25:31.000]  So now they make up that I've been sued about that. It's just bizarre.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  But Hogg says, Hey, Alex Jones, you seem to be really confused as to what I do.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  I do who I am. And I'd love to come on and clear some of this up because clearly as a,
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  you know what journalist you can't. Clearly.
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  And then he's got stuff in here about when your snake oil only makes you do this 45 days later.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  I mean, I lost like 15 pounds gain muscle.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  And yeah, I had been to the beach right before. So I was more tan.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  We shot it in the same area of the office fluorescent lighting.
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.000]  You can see how much softer I was so much more tone I got.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  I'm a husky guy, but I lost a lot of weight.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  That's, that's amazing.
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  So he was, I might not be great with spellier punctuation,
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  but unlike Jones do research and don't sell snake oil to masses.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  Yeah. Jeff Bezos is the biggest supplement seller in the world and doesn't pay taxes,
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  but he's okay with the Washington Post writes articles about how I'm a snake oil salesman,
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.000]  but I sell many of the same products that Whole Foods and Amazon do just private label at a lower price.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  So again, think about how they operate.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Think about how stupid they think you are.
[26:44.000 --> 26:52.000]  And then it's always the same talking point by every leftist group is snake oil and you got sued for Sandy Hook.
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  And just all these things that aren't even true, but it's, it's, it's what they've come up with.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  And if Hogg isn't being told what to say, he's going out and copying what other people say,
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  because we all know the attacks and this is the attack on your free speech.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  And people are going, yeah, as we know, we're all getting kicked off Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  We're all getting censored.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  You know, help us.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  I know it's thousands of sites.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  I can't even keep track of it.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  And there's no news coverage of the purge.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  And then the president when he gets told about it says, well, they're not going to censor me.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  They're censoring everything that magnifies the make America great again agenda.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  And then they lie about Donald Trump Jr. and say that he said nobody died.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  They were crisis actors.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  He just pointed out, why is it four kids out of 3000?
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  And why are they all in the drama club?
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  And that's a fact.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  But I want to be clear, YouTube.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  Let me do a document cam shot.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  Please for TV viewers gave us these new strikes on the Alex Jones channel.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  The first one was David all can't remember his lines.
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  Remember, and then it's him, them telling him what to say on camera and fumbling around.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  And clearly he's being told what to say.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  And then the new strikes are what is to blame for the Florida high school shooting.
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  And then we say SSRIs not responding to the warnings.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  That's a, oh, and Shroyer.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  And then this is myself and this is myself and Milo.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  We did another one, learn more the truth about crisis actors in the Florida shooting.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  Now that's a YouTube style headline.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  And then we say, we do not believe they're crisis actors.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  We believe the shootings real out of the gates.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  And we talk about how I'd been censored that day by CNN and how they were involved in torsion
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  interference and racketeering.
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  So my response saying, they don't want you to know that I believe real people died.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  And I'm not attacking David Hogg.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  That's what they took down says is bullying.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  And then David Hogg could sit there and say, I challenge you, you piece of garbage,
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  you snake ball salesman, you moron.
[28:55.000 --> 29:24.000]  I challenge you and that's okay.
[29:25.000 --> 29:30.000]  This is Dan Pilla.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria,
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.000]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[32:40.000 --> 32:46.000]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  and other free radicals.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Infowars Life.

[33:12.000 --> 33:26.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:26.000 --> 33:30.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.000 --> 33:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowars has been chosen as a microcosm of how to ban free speech on social networks.
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  And if you're able to do that, if you're able to shut us down, you can shut everybody down.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.000]  That has been openly announced by News Corp, by Google, and by others, and they think we're morons.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  But we have hidden camera footage, you name it.
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.000]  I want to get into all the other big world news as well, tell you about some of the guests that are coming up.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  But before we do that, we just had big developments during the break.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  Michael Zimmerman just came in here who's over our YouTube channels and are streaming.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  We do a document cam shot. I can show the viewers this.
[34:17.000 --> 34:26.000]  We told you how YouTube is engaging in strikes against our account,
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  saying that we said no one died and that it was crisis actors.
[34:30.000 --> 34:39.000]  And then the videos, in all the videos, we say people died, it was real, and the young adults are not crisis actors.
[34:39.000 --> 34:49.000]  But that they are on the acting team and out of 3,000 students have been chosen by the media to make it look like everyone's anti-gun, which isn't true.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  Now, that's absolute fact.
[34:51.000 --> 35:03.000]  So CNN says we want the Alex Jones channel banned last Friday, unprecedented, wanting another media outlet banned.
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  They said they filed more complaints over the weekend.
[35:07.000 --> 35:17.000]  They removed videos when we were critical of CNN and said that CNN was involved in racketeering.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  Now, one of the videos, David Hogg can't remember his lines. We point out that he's clearly on camera.
[35:22.000 --> 35:30.000]  They've taken this video down everywhere and someone's filming him off camera while he's being interviewed by national news, but they're taping it.
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.000]  And he keeps going, I can't remember. What do I say? Okay, no, no, it wasn't Israel. It was a mass shooting.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  And we say he's probably really tired or were they feeding him lines.
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  The person's feeding him lines off camera. That doesn't mean the shooting didn't happen.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  You can see the video for yourself on infowars.com.
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  Well, CNN knows this is getting a lot of attention.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  They're the ones running this. They admit they're running this inside YouTube.
[35:56.000 --> 36:09.000]  Also, in the New York Times, he's on hidden camera saying that they interface and tell YouTube how to censor us that we're the main enemy because we understand how they run their scams.
[36:09.000 --> 36:18.000]  Well, just minutes ago, they removed the second strikes.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  They just removed the second strike.
[36:21.000 --> 36:38.000]  Now, they rejected our appeal on the first strike, so we can't live stream on that channel, but they had frozen the entire channel, as of the middle of the night last night, as of this morning, saying we bullied children.
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.000]  And then they'll never say what that means, but then the media says, oh, did you hear Jones had his video deleted saying nobody died?
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  Then you actually watch the video, we reupload, they get 7 million views, and it's people saying the police stood down.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  Well, that's what's been confirmed now.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  It's in mainstream news now.
[36:55.000 --> 37:07.000]  We told you the day after it happened because we just went to the students and a local newscast and to what was being filmed at press conferences, but they didn't make the news that they didn't want you to see.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  And we said, maybe these are wrong reports, maybe these young people are wrong.
[37:12.000 --> 37:19.000]  But, I mean, we never say we know what's going on until it's cut and dry.
[37:19.000 --> 37:29.000]  So, we had videos responding to CNN being involved in this, and clearly it's tortuous interference.
[37:29.000 --> 37:40.000]  I've talked to my lawyers, it's unprecedented to have another media outlet in your own private account filing complaints on you and then misrepresenting what the videos were to shut you down.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  I mean, that's what the mafia does.
[37:42.000 --> 37:49.000]  That's the definition of racketeering laws was to stop big, powerful groups getting together to squeeze out smaller groups.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  We own the grocery stores in this area, Queens.
[37:52.000 --> 37:58.000]  You don't sell to us, it's going to burn down.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  Or the inspectors are harassing your little grocery store because you won't sell and finally you sell.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  That's racketeering.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  They call it discrimination if you won't bake a gay couple of cake.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  I say, bake their cake.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  But $500,000, what about this?
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.000]  Because we're in the top one-penth of 1% of YouTube.
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  And they know that.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  And they know this is massive tortuous interference.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  It's racketeering.
[38:31.000 --> 38:42.000]  It's so criminal that the courts will have to, in a civil case, rule against them, even though it's civil, because it'll set the precedent for massive organized crime going forward if they don't get in trouble.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  But here's the deal.
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  The big investors at CNN, they don't care, man.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  They're using news outlets as cutouts for intelligence operations.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  That's what this is, to set the precedent to shut us down.
[38:54.000 --> 39:02.000]  They already tried to destroy talk radio, buy it out, buy out the local stations, take the sponsors, tried to kick everybody off air, support those local affiliates.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  That's so critical.
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.000]  But here, document cam shot for TV viewers all scrubbing for radio listeners, community guidelines.
[39:10.000 --> 39:20.000]  So they upheld the first fake strike, which itself is not what they say we said.
[39:20.000 --> 39:27.000]  And then they got rid of the strike tube.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  What is to blame for the Florida high school shooting?
[39:31.000 --> 39:38.000]  And we said SSRIs, lack of response time, stand down, people in government custody, that's almost always who's involved.
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  That's the MO.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  That's the fingerprints.
[39:41.000 --> 39:49.000]  Then the truth about crisis actors in the Florida shooting, first thing we say, and by the way, Zimmerman's uploading those videos now.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  From the computers where they were uploaded to our servers.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  I think he's probably done as soon as he's done.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  I want to have those clips for us here.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  They're going to be on info wars because you can go see for yourself.
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  We say the first thing we say is there were not crisis actors this shooting really happened.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  That's then banned for us saying they were crisis actors.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  But here's the bigger issue.
[40:08.000 --> 40:17.000]  If we wanted to say that they were really flying one horn, one eye purple people leaders, or they were Chinese jet pilots from deep space,
[40:17.000 --> 40:24.000]  or that they were purple dragons, or they identified as golden dragonates or beautiful or eight buildings as Google executives do.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  I'm not kidding.
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  If we want to be crazy online about a big public event and public figures and we don't believe any of it,
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  you know, Schizophrenic doesn't believe something, that's their right too, that you don't then ban them.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  But we didn't even do that.
[40:40.000 --> 40:47.000]  And then Hogg is bullying me going, look how ugly you are, you're a piece of crap.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  You know, you're a this journalist.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  I can't say the cuss words on air.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  You got sued.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  All of this is defamatory.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  None of it's true.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  And he's saying he wants to debate and I bet a lot and maybe I'm wrong.
[41:01.000 --> 41:09.000]  But I'll bet you a chicken fried steak and all beer you can drink that hog does not get on this show live with me.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  And I'll be totally polite because they want me to try to crucify him.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  This was stupid baiting whoever's handling that account.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  Stupid, stupid baiting to go, oh, look, Alex is a fat person.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  Oh, he's a piece of crap.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  Oh, he's an idiot.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  And then to have a sub guy lost his kids.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  Not true.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  Yeah, he got sued for, you know, hurting kids at Sandy Hook.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  All lies.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  And he's bullying me.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  They're on CNN.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  He's a he's a young man.
[41:35.000 --> 41:44.000]  He's a high school senior, a public figure, and he's on there with Stelter and all of them saying Stelter saying Van Alex Jones and Glenn Beck's like, yeah, they're not doing enough.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  Think about this.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  And then YouTube finally went, whoa.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  Last Friday, this didn't like the normal people.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  They just totally ban people don't even tell them why all the time.
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  Much less to their whole fake strike thing or their community guidelines deal with they run and control or something like a copyright claim or anything.
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  They just feel like it.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  They say, oh, some anonymous person flagged you off of the gulag.
[42:05.000 --> 42:13.000]  They they're going, wait a minute, we banned these videos last week and they got seven plus million views.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  It was a top story on Drudge.
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  We better reinstate it till nobody's paying attention and ban him later.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  Because they're like, whoa, this is getting too much attention.
[42:23.000 --> 42:39.000]  We need to back down because of course he's article, you know, is in front of the president right now about how they need to move with civil rights violations, racketeering, but really Sherman anti trust and large corporations and groups saying you were not going to rent cars to black people.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  We're not going to sell houses to black people.
[42:41.000 --> 42:51.000]  Well, if you're a conservative or pro gun or whatever, we're going to misrepresent what you said and do and then ban you from the electronic media, from the digital media, which is a civil rights violation in the modern age.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  They've advertised themselves in Congress as a utility.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  They're trying to block conservatives from access to services.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  Oh, they've committed a lot of crimes, folks.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  I'm so excited.
[43:01.000 --> 43:11.000]  The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[43:19.000 --> 43:31.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[43:35.000 --> 43:49.000]  Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  It is amazing.
[43:52.000 --> 43:59.000]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[43:59.000 --> 44:07.000]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from m4warslife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[44:19.000 --> 44:32.000]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[44:32.000 --> 44:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy.
[44:40.000 --> 44:49.000]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.000]  Find out for yourself today at m4warsstore.com, what it can do for your family.
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.000]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida. Victor, you're calling. Go ahead.
[45:05.000 --> 45:13.000]  Hi, Alex. First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[45:17.000 --> 45:29.000]  In particular, silver bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little stick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet and it like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power and the pollen block.
[45:33.000 --> 45:43.000]  Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.000]  But when you mention the silver bullet, colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[45:49.000 --> 45:58.000]  It is our highest-reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country discounted high-quality colloidal silver, and it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[45:58.000 --> 46:05.000]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[46:10.000 --> 46:18.000]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:18.000 --> 46:27.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[46:27.000 --> 46:34.000]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[46:34.000 --> 46:43.000]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[46:43.000 --> 46:51.000]  Floralife is sold as a 15-billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50-billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[47:21.000 --> 47:28.000]  On corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you now from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[47:51.000 --> 48:06.000]  I agree with that, and they've compiled 49 different things that he's completed, but it was overall agenda, about 64% getting out of the Paris Climate Accord,
[48:06.000 --> 48:14.000]  repealing net neutrality, which wasn't really net neutrality, reshaping national monuments where they'd done a bunch of seizing in private land,
[48:14.000 --> 48:22.000]  resetting the Mexico City policy, increasing military spending, reforming temporary assistance for needy families,
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  long development of natural resources, reforming government agencies, withdrawing from UNESCO.
[48:28.000 --> 48:39.000]  The UN ran since the 90s, since 1994 when Clinton got us into it fully. George Bush Sr. signed us onto it, but UNESCO really runs the global government.
[48:39.000 --> 48:47.000]  It sets policy. We were already basically under it, but they put us under it fully, where it told us who could come in as refugees,
[48:47.000 --> 48:53.000]  including people with huge criminal records, terrorists, you name it. But I went over their list, it's not even that good.
[48:53.000 --> 49:02.000]  We wrote articles about his first 100 days that were better than this, and all I'm saying is the Heritage Foundation kind of skews things and only hits a few areas.
[49:02.000 --> 49:13.000]  Kill on the TPP. What about crushing political correctness? What about bypassing the mainstream media? Because those are promises as well.
[49:13.000 --> 49:21.000]  What about just the list goes on and on? But I will tell you, Trump said no more restrictions on the Second Amendment controlled criminals.
[49:21.000 --> 49:32.000]  He is starting to like, oh, bump stocks, oh, age 21. That goes back to going on the defense when we should be pointing out the guy was on serotonry uptake inhibitors.
[49:32.000 --> 49:40.000]  There was a stand down. And again, we have had teachers on, we've played the clips, we've had students on the show ourselves.
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  We've had the local newscast. There's another article right here, and it's up to all of us just because we know all this.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  We're in a war, and we tend to move on as stuff breaks, and they just come back.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  There are articles all over the country saying Jones lied and said no children died.
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  And Jones lied and said they were all crisis actors brought in from out of state. Never said that.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  But they go further, they go. And Jones, that dirty rat said there was a stand down.
[50:05.000 --> 50:14.000]  Yeah, I said the day after that it appears there was a stand down for at least six, seven minutes, and the sheriff's deputies mashed outside.
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  And now they are saying, look, we were ordered to stop until officers got there that had body camps.
[50:20.000 --> 50:27.000]  And that's in the Miami Herald now.
[50:27.000 --> 50:36.000]  But it doesn't matter. AP, Reuters, Fortune, all ran headlines saying YouTube pulls Alex Jones videos saying student anti-unactivists were actors.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  And that's fortunate to me, a little bit more accurate. I did say they are student actors.
[50:39.000 --> 50:47.000]  And it looks like they're reading off a script, but not that again, they're out of town. And I keep repeating that because this is their plan.
[50:47.000 --> 50:57.000]  They said we're going to call all conservative speech bullying, and then we're going to bully you and call for your death and call for Trump's death and kill the NRA and hashtag 100 Republicans.
[50:57.000 --> 51:06.000]  And we're going to have David Hogg online calling me all sorts of names and all saying things I never did.
[51:06.000 --> 51:16.000]  Whoever's running that Twitter account or it's Hogg, young man, you are in a man's world. You are an adult world.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  Do you support free speech? Because we know you don't support the Second Amendment.
[51:20.000 --> 51:26.000]  You challenged me now. I know that's because you thought I'd shoot my mouth off about you. And then you could call that bullying.
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.000]  I know it's CNN. They're like, Jones hasn't taken the bait.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  I keep saying he said it's all fake. We don't have a clip. The one media matters put out so edited they can't use it. It's obvious.
[51:39.000 --> 51:45.000]  They even blur it so you can't tell what they do with the cuts, but it's unbelievable. You can hardly even tell it to me. It's so blurred to hide the cuts.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  They got some really low grade tricksters over there.
[51:48.000 --> 52:00.000]  And I've responded to Hogg because I got a bunch of guys coming on in tons of news next hour. I'm going to segue some out of this.
[52:00.000 --> 52:06.000]  It's just, this isn't about info wars. We have to get the alarm to the president. We have to get it to the media.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  We have to get to everybody that this is happening.
[52:10.000 --> 52:19.000]  And Dr. Corsi's video about the president taking action in 2018 and his military intelligence contacts and White House contacts about what Trump's planning to do.
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.000]  That video was banned and his sites frozen.
[52:23.000 --> 52:30.000]  And if you're not a public figure and don't fight back, they don't care how you appeal. They'll just still delete your site.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  But YouTube's understanding that I've not taken the bait.
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  They admittedly are in consultation with CNN basically running my account right now.
[52:38.000 --> 52:43.000]  And so CNN's like, their lawyers are telling them, no, they really do have tortuous interference here.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  You guys shouldn't have shot your mouths off.
[52:45.000 --> 52:52.000]  Why'd you write an article saying that you're deciding if a site stays up and that having a bunch of guests on saying shut him down?
[52:52.000 --> 52:58.000]  That's right. You should have just banned me and not run your mouths, but you can't help it.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  Again, what is CNN doing inside there?
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  So right here, here's the tweets I sent to David Hall.
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  David, you are welcome to come on my shows. He says he wants to come on.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  Then he calls me about your names to challenge.
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.000]  Are you aware that CNN is using you as part of a lobbying campaign to shut down info wars?
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  You are now a public figure and activist. You are not immune to criticism.
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  We know your views on the Second Amendment. Do you support the first?
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  And I said, hi, David, it would be fantastic for you to come on.
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  I would be very thankful for that.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  I want to set the record straight and clear things up between you and I.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  Here's another one.
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  I would love to have you on my show to clear up some of the disinformation because he's not responding.
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.000]  That has been put out about my statements, but he's tweeting live time while this has happened.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  So he's not responding.
[53:45.000 --> 53:50.000]  He's in class. He says he's not going back to school. He's graduating into CNN.
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.000]  I would love to have you on my show to clear up some of the disinformation that has been put out by my statements concerning the tragedy.
[53:56.000 --> 54:04.000]  I notice you're calling me a bleep bleep and a bleep bleep when I never have called you any disparaging names.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  I've also never been sued by survivors of any shooting.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  Please stop the defamation.
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  My YouTube channel with two plus billion views has been frozen out for CNN and lobbying for it to be closed in your name.
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  Again, Mr. Hogg, in your name CNN shut down my speech on YouTube.
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  It is critical that you come out and support the First Amendment and not let them use this to end free speech.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  See, we have to turn this around into what it is.
[54:27.000 --> 54:37.000]  They've gotten a bunch of well-spoken anti-gun young people out of 3000, four of them to come out and be the spokesperson.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  We're just saying you're anti-gun spokesperson.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  Where are all the other people?
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  And by the way, there was a stand down.
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  And they're like, no, we're going to delete that.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  And we're going to say you said that we aren't real.
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  Well, sorry.
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.000]  I've got a platform of over 200 radio stations, now over 100 TV stations.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  And we have got websites that have millions of visitors a day.
[54:57.000 --> 55:04.000]  And we have allies like Drudge, this ally of the First Amendment, who linked to our video and it got 7 million views.
[55:04.000 --> 55:05.000]  And you know what?
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  The videos, YouTube did ban them.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  They've put them back up that we're going to post now on infowars.com.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  I'm told it's going up right now.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  They're fresh and see if they're up yet.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  The latest two videos banned by them.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  You see?
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  The latest two videos banned by them.
[55:23.000 --> 55:29.000]  And they realize, how are they going to sit there in court banning me when the videos are the opposite of what they said they were?
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  So they're just going to keep looking for something that fits.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  But I've already got the whole chain.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  And by the way, I don't want to sue you guys and have a two year battle and win.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  I just want you to stop.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  My business model is freedom.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  My business model is not winning lawsuits, but it's important legally too.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  I keep putting you on notice because we're going to show the juries all this stuff.
[55:51.000 --> 55:57.000]  And I'm not calling for hog to be bullied, calling me names, calling me a liar, calling me scum, calling me feces.
[55:57.000 --> 55:58.000]  That's just right to do that.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  I'm an adult public figure, son.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  Now it's not right to say I lost lawsuits for defaming children.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  That's defamation.
[56:05.000 --> 56:06.000]  And that's a talking point.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.000]  But if you are involved in shutting down my speech, horses interference, young man.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  So we're going to look into all that now briefly.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  The biggest thing you can do other than spread the articles and the videos and knowing this is a total war ahead of the other guests.
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  We have another topic topics we're going to cover is my products from us.
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  We had a lot of support yesterday.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  I appreciate you.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  I'm really trying to expand.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  I'm launching all this new satellite up links.
[56:30.000 --> 56:31.000]  A lot of big things are happening.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  And if we bring in a lot of money, it makes it easier to fight these people.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  Plus we got products you need.

[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  It's not.
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  This is basically a clone of the very best selling brands for a lower price.
[57:06.000 --> 57:12.000]  A lot of these fiber things have really crappy forms of fiber that are really toxic and bad for you.

[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Alright, coming up, let me tell you about some of the guests we've got on today.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Syrian girl comes from a party that was in power before Assad, and she lives in Australia,
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  but she's well known, her full name's Public, and she's really given us great information on what happened in Syria,
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  and the ongoing wars, and how Trump's trying to get out of there, but the Pentagon's wanting to stay there.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  She's going to be popping in in the next two segments.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  And then, Zach from Morocco, an incredible intel source, will give us the latest on what he sees with all the censorship,
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  the attacks on Trump, Trump announcing early, he's going to run, Obama did it, 582 days out,
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  which was 100 days earlier than the predecessor, 100 plus days.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  Trump's doing it 980 days out, I don't think it's really smart, so we're going to look at that.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Zach from Morocco is popping in, Spachanik couldn't come on yesterday, he's popping in, and then Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  But also, I'm going to open the phones up some, specifically on Trump.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  And do you think he's going sideways saying, we'll look at bump stocks, we'll look at age 21 to own a semi-automatic rifle?
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  I think it's the first thing 14 months in he's done that's a real betrayal.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And I know that it's a tactic, and I'll be reassured if this happens, and I think I'll be proven right.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  But it's a tactic that Trump has used, where he goes, I always said during the campaign, if you've been here decades,
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  don't have a criminal record or contributing, we should fast track you being a citizen, that's totally reasonable.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  But all these people that are MS-13 have been deported dozens of times, and are armed robbers and arsonists,
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  and they're supposed to stay, by the way, the Democrats are trying to defend those people now in Oakland,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  saying don't let ICE come take them, and warning them ICE is coming in.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  I mean, this is incredible, totally illegal, and civil war type stuff.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And then the Democrats go, we want total embassy, anybody forever, totally wide open, no borders, world government.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  And he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, then you get nothing.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  So he's like, yeah, bump stocks, yeah, age 21, and the Democrats are like, no, we want a total abolition,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  second amendment, what will take those compromises, batting all semi-auto, that's what Dianne Feinstein and others have introduced.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  So I think he's taking the politics out of it at a level, acting like he's reasonable, but knowing that they're not going to be reasonable.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  Because in the past, they take little pieces, now they want the big pieces.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  So I'm sure in my heart, that's what's happening, but let me tell you something.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  If that isn't what's going on, and he starts caving in, and then on the next shooting, he does more.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  I'm not going to say, oh my God, I'm wrong, Trump's evil.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  He's already turned back so much, it just means, well, we bought this reprieve, he's caving in.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  And I don't know why he'd cave in, because it's making his base really mad,
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  he bought the base, who blew up at me months ago, going, look, he's going to give amnesty.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  And I said, he always said, if you've been here decades, don't have a criminal record, and you've got a job, we want those people.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  That's reasonable.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  But if you're a criminal or all this other stuff, and you've been deported, and you're here illegally, and you're full grown, your ass is out of here.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  And that's what he still stands for.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  So with Trump, he's pretty neurotic about doing what he says he'll do.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  But I think he probably thinks Bumstock's who needs him and add 21, his sons are more pro-gun than he is, because he was never really into guns.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  His sons are big gun guys.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  But Eric's out there saying it's reasonable.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  I think it's bad, I think it's a wrong move, but I at a Machiavellian level know what Trump's doing.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  And I know what he'll, it's the art of the deal.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  Even though he understands it makes the base mad, he'll go, okay, we'll give you a little, and then they don't want to, no, we want it all.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And then by them doing that, he can go, look, I tried to do something.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  So that's the tactic.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  And I don't like it because it's selling the states, the governors, the people that he's talking to right now.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  He said, oh, don't worry, I got the states, the gun lobby's going to be okay.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Well, you know, I talked to Ted Nugent on off here and I've talked to other board members, the NRA.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Just the last few days, some of which will go unnamed and they are really worried about you, Mr. President.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Because we've spent decades getting the NRA up to snuff, understanding no compromise.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  It's made them bigger, it's made them stronger, it's made them more successful.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  And that's the model of success that you followed as well.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  So compromise with these people that you can't compromise with is not the right move.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  We'll be back.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  We'll be back.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  That's right.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars has a platform.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Info Wars has an audience, you.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Info Wars has hundreds of radio affiliates, now over 100 TV affiliates.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Info Wars has made up a red blood of Americans of every race, color, and creed that want freedom.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  And YouTube and Facebook and Twitter are purging conservatives by the thousands.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Or anybody that asks questions.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Or anybody that promotes Trump's speeches.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  And the president has to understand that, that he's a guardian of the First Amendment.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  And that he believes he can still punch through and reach people.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  But it was the internet and the grassroots that brought Trump to power.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  Even though he's got a great new campaign head that he's announced for the 2020 run.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Same guy that ran his tech before and that guy's real smart.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  He doesn't get the credit.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  All of us together get the credit.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  It's not about taking credit from his new campaign head.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  It's just that the media is crediting him with the win.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  It's everybody.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  It's drudge.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  It's the internet.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  It's the people.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  It's the memes.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  It's the responses that overpowered the censorship and overpowered the disinfo.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  But YouTube first banned us from streaming our site.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  There were two billion views on one of our sites alone.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  They put strikes on all the other channels, froze those.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  They then banned us today.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  They blocked the channel and they told us that the site was banned and that they were going to delete it.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Then an hour ago, this came in.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  They deleted the second strike.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Didn't give us a record.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  This is what they normally would just little people who are, by the way, the most important.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  They delete you.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  They don't even, you're just a slave.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  They don't even tell you why.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  Look at this.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Document him.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Nothing.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Community guidelines.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  And suddenly, here's our record.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  It's just gone.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  You can see right here.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  This is this morning.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  These were videos saying that the kids did die and they were not crisis actors.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  They then said you have a strike.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  You said they were crisis actors.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  And then now they've just disappeared it.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  They didn't say, oh, you won your strike.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  They didn't say you won your appeal.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  I can have the headline.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  Alex Jones wins appeal against YouTube.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  You know, did not say they were crisis actors.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  No, they just delete it.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Because see, they can't win right now because I have my own platform.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  The videos they deleted last week, I put up, they got 7 million views.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  There's drugs linked to it and you spread it.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  So they don't know what to do right now.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  They want to misrepresent what I said, but we have our own platform.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Thanks to you.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And I want to salute the listeners.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  God bless you.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  I want to play this clip from the deleted video that makes them so mad that we're now posting info wars.com.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  As we speak, the censored videos, they don't want you to see them.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  We'll go to Syrian girl says it violation of YouTube's harassment and bullying.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  And it says the truth about crisis actors and the Florida shooting.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  And then we said there were none in our view.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  If you think they're worth, that's your right.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  But this is next level where they misrepresent what you say and then ban you.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  And they figured this out.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  They're like, wait, he's got the video.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  He'll show the fraud.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  It's not that they're good.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  They got SJWs.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  We have the behind the scenes video.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  And I'm told more is coming out from Veritas, even more devastating.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  And it's about us again.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Again, how's, what's the jury going to think of that?
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Google thinks they're invincible.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Not when you have the entire operation than admitting it's politics.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Not about bullying.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Here's the clip.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Are we saying the shooting didn't happen?
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Are we saying they're all actors and that they're faking that something happened?
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  No, the media is saying that.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  What we're saying is that, just as Gateway Pundit wrote,
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  school shooting survivor turned activist dad,
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  Hogg's father in FBI appears to have been coached on anti-Trump lines.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  That's all true.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  School shooting survivor turned activist.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  His dad is in the FBI and he appears to be heavily coached.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  And then it's the same for people over and over and over again.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And now he's gone on national television to say over and over again
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  with the known CIA operative, Anderson Cooper.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  So the guy's dad's FBI is on the CIA guy's show.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  He's on the fake news, CNN known for staging things.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  And he says over and over again, I am not a crisis actor.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  I am not a crisis actor.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  I am not a crisis actor.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  No, you're a Democratic Party operative.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  Your father and your mother are on record.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  You go to CNN.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  You're all over other news programs being anti-gun.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  You were interviewed by CBS to give your whole anti-gun spiel.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Before all this happened.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  And so what we're saying is you're being used as a tool, as a spokesman,
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  as a mouthpiece so people can say, oh, it's a child.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Don't disagree with what he says when he says not one more child can die giving your guns.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Well, you're not a child.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  You're a senior in high school who's in journalism school and also in drama.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  And so are your other friends.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  And so you're now in this world.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  And we're going to point out that why out of 3000 is it only this four.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  And I keep beating that drum because this is the big fight.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  We're going to Syrian girl and she also has been censored massively.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  She's been on national Australian television.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  She's been all over her family.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  He's been at the top of the government in Syria, previous regimes.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  She's not an Assad fan, but she has given really accurate information and follow her at partisan girl.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  Syrian girl partisan on YouTube where she's been.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  You can see the deleted videos right there.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  You can see that they've taken down most of her videos because she showed the CIA funded rebels launching chemical attacks.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  She translated it from Arabic.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  And again, back on the Obama days, they didn't want you to know that.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  So she joins us to talk about the censorship then the next segment.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Also, it's really going on there now that that's not the news.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  The war is still ongoing.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  So Syrian girl, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  No, thank you so much for having me on.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Well, break it down the censorship and the latest what's happening in Syria.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Absolutely.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Well, I had a mass thanks to your program as well, 40,000 followers on Facebook.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And one day I woke up and without any warning or 30 days like ban, they just deleted it completely.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  And I actually had contacts inside Facebook, which were given to me by Lauren Southern.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  And I asked, you know, what's the problem?
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  The latest post that I wrote was about election fraud in Kurdistan in Iraq.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  And I have no reply, no response.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  And until the day they've given me no reason.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  And on YouTube, you know, my, my videos began to be flagged for no reason at all.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And when I appealed, one time I appealed and they were given back to me.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  But then the same videos were once again taken down.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  So I was left with two flags on my channel and all I could do was put all of my videos on private.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to have a channel anymore.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  And now I'm not even able to post.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  So the censorship is really, really rampant and it's probably going to get worse.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  You know, maybe in future it's going to become illegal to watch Russia today because it's Russian collusion.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  You know, this is kind of a Cold War thing that we're returning to which haunts everywhere.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  And it's quite shocking to see something as big as info wars getting censored in almost the same way.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  Well, that's right. And again, I should have led the whole broadcast today with the fact that
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Apple is becoming a state-run company of China under the deal to have 0% tax.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  And they're going to move the whole iCloud everybody's code keys over there.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  And the Chinese government, they admit are going to work inside Apple, not just there, but with connections worldwide into Apple.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  They wouldn't even give the FBI the code keys after San Bernardino to one phone.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  So all I'm saying is, man, Silicon Valley is ready to become pure authoritarian.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Well, Paul, which you had on your show a few weeks ago, you know, he was having a suggestion that they should put into law that anti censorship into law.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  And I think that would be a great thing to support.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  But because I know your time is limited, I would love to get into the things that are happening in Syria as well.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  We're going to go to break about a minute and a half.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  But yes, start getting into the big stack of news I've got here.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Curtis fighters raise PKK flag. What that means.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Right now, what is the state of Syria now?
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Well, at the moment, we've got Al Qaeda controlling pockets near Damascus and Idlib.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  We've got the U.S. a few weeks ago, the U.S. military unfortunately attacked Syrian and Russian forces,
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  killing scores of Russian fighters there, which is a huge escalation.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  We've got a false flag chemical attack happening near Damascus, which Russia actually warned about a couple of weeks ago.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  And we've got the, which was a policy that started under the Obama administration, the U.S. sort of supporting these Kurdish groups in the northeast of Syria,
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  which is claimed is the greatest group, but the media, of course, is lying and admitting much of the truth as usual.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  And we know they're lying to Trump too.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  There's different elements of the military are trying to keep some of the Al Qaeda forces there to destabilize things
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  and kind of keep a Western finger in the area, even though Trump reportedly told McMaster and all of them,
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  take out ISIS and get out. Stop it. I want out of there.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  We'll be back with Syrian girls straight ahead.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  Earth-friendly and natural soaps.

[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.

[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Alright, Zach, our high level military intelligence connection. I know who he is. He's who he says he is. Incredible information.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  He's coming up in the next few segments. I'll invite Syrian girl back on for a full hour on the war room, or with David Nutter, myself, here in the near future.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  But why is this so important an update from her?
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  Over the last six years, she's been off and on reporting to the world from Australia, their exiles out of Syria didn't even like Assad, but were telling the truth,
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  that the globalists were breaking up the country, subdividing it, and letting ISIS forces out of Saudi Arabia backed by Obama, formerly Al-Qaeda forces take over.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  Trump came out, talked about how Hillary and Obama founded ISIS. All that was true. Rand Paul talked about it. Ted Cruz talked about it.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  And it was first Syrian girl and Ron Paul and Rand Paul and myself and others in Drudge Report that helped put that out there.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  And our military did the right thing and said they didn't want to be part of it. The problem is it's still ongoing.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  If we don't snuff it out, and the globalists are trying to keep some forces still in Syria to keep the conflict alive, when Syria is not even anti-Western at this point.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  So she's going to update you on they want this out of sight out of mind. So the president doesn't even know about it.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  But on record, he's telling him to try to end it. But I have sources, not just Zach coming up, but I have sources in the military,
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  not just in this building as well, who say that no, we are resupplying them for a whole new war. And it's being done covertly.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  So give us an update and break this down for folks Syrian girl.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  Well, it's just as you say, you know, Trump is saying something. He's saying that we want to finish ISIS and then leave. And now ISIS is pretty much almost done.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  And of course, the media doesn't ever talk about that fact that al-Qaeda is also in the country and the Syrian military is fighting it because they're usually taking the side of al-Qaeda still in the media.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  So but then you have people like Tillerson who recently made a statement that they're going to occupy Syria indefinitely, which means troops inside Syria indefinitely.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  And the excuse that they're giving now is not that they want to fight ISIS, but they want to protect the Kurds.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  And the thing is that these Kurdish groups that have been given like a golden sort of paintbrush by the mainstream media,
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  there's a little bit more to it that they're not quite telling you, which is the fact that the group that they're supporting the YPG are a anarcho communist group,
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  which are linked quite strongly to another group called the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  So essentially, once again, they're promoting and giving guns to what they listed as terrorists not long ago.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  I mean, yes, they did fight ISIS, but they're also listed as a terrorist organization.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Also, hasn't US and European Antifa gone and fought with them?
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Yeah, they absolutely have. And that's going to create even a bigger problem because they're going to return home and use the weapons knowledge that they gained in Syria for crossing there illegally.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  And in fact, in Australia, we've already had one of them commit a murder here.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  So, you know, in fact, when they liberated Raqqa, the Kurdish groups at the US armed, they put up a poster of the leader of the PKK terrorist organization in the center of Raqqa,
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  which just shows you how linked they are to the organization.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  And the thing, the propaganda that they give you is that the poor Kurds, you know, their country was stolen from them.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  But the reality is that there was never such thing as Kurdistan because the Kurdish people were nomadic.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  They came to Syria in the 1920s as refugees from Turkey.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  And, you know, the place that they say was a historic Kurdistan was actually Armenia.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  And that's all historical, that's all historical fact.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  And Turkey is always kicking them out into Syria still today.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  Yes. And we accepted them as refugees.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  I mean, we left them in, but now they are turning around and said, OK, now this is our land.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  But there's one to two million Kurds in Syria.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  There's 22 million Syrians.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  But the land that they're trying to claim is like 30 percent of Syria and has much of the oil and much of the water that's supposed to feed 22 million.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Well, here's the issue with Tillerson.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  And I'm not defending what he's doing, but it is true.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Turkey's been invading and driving into the Kurds who they're always trying to kick out.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  So there's different factions here.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  So how does that tie into it?
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Well, Turkey is invading Syria and they're going into the Syrian areas.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  But they have it basically worked out where they're slicing Syria up into pieces where everything east of the Euphrates goes to the U.S. and the Kurds.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And basically anyone who's Kurdish west of the Euphrates just gets to be slaughtered by Turkey.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  And that area has been designated as like an al-Qaeda area.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  It's part of the, you know, Turkey and, you know, this communist group, it's all kind of a manipulation to try to divide Syria.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  And the thing is that even though they're portrayed as the secular group, the other minorities in those areas are getting ethnically cleansed
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  because they want to make sure that Kurds remain a majority.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  So people like the Assyrian Christians, which have been there for thousands of years,
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  they're getting assassinated, kicked off their homes.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  They're making laws that if any one of them leaves their homes, then their homes can be occupied and taken.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  People who have left their cities because of ISIS, they're not allowed to return.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  If they're Christian, I have a friend who's like that.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  And, you know, the fact is that just recently, using this excuse, there was a Syrian force called ISIS Hunters.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  The Russian militia alongside this Russian militia that was fighting ISIS in the area was bombed by the U.S.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  because they got too close to the oil fields, just close to the oil fields.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  Sure. And for folks that don't understand, they've decided to divide it in three pieces like they always have.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  And yes, Trump doesn't like ISIS, so they're trying to run them out.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  But when Syria tries to go into its own territory to finally unify the country, to stop the conflict,
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  once and for all, the destabilization policy is staying in place to actually allow ISIS and other groups to keep pockets there
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  for a future breakup of the country, which is very, very anti-American, very, very immoral.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  And it's not what Trump ran on doing.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Yes, a peace for Kurdish communists over here, even though it's going to be terrible for Christian and Arab minorities.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  A peace for al-Qaeda over here, a pocket of ISIS down here.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  And, you know, without the oil and the water in that area that they were trying to control, Syria will not be able to be built.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  And that means the refugees will not be able to return.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  You know, this chaos will continue.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  U.S. troops will be stationed there.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  And I know that that's not what Trump voters wanted.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  That's not what they voted for.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  I keep saying crush ISIS, and then the military is held back by the generals.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  And then when Trump's gotten mad about it, it's even come out, we broke it, but it's come out in the news,
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  all three times we broke it, months later, word for word, he screams at him and says,
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I told you, crush ISIS, crush al-Qaeda, pull out of the country, they didn't attack us, we're not supposed to be there.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  But then every time the Russians are about to finally drive out these nests, the U.S. accidentally bombs them.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  And it's happened a bunch of times, and Russia understands what's going on
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  and doesn't even report it in its news, and U.S. news beams it in and CNN says,
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  Putin's got a problem, U.S. killing his troops, but he's covering up from Russians.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  Those are CNN headlines every day, trying to get Russians mad at Putin.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Putin understands the grandeur manipulation and is trying not to be drawn into an anti-American stance
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  by the globalists that, again, want to divide and conquer the whole world.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Well, that's right, like, unfortunately, even though Trump is in power, the deep state,
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  you know, he wanted to get rid of a lot of these people.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  Unfortunately, they've proven very difficult, and there's a lot of pressure, I'm sure.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  And, you know, unfortunately, now it's escalating to the point where this oldest Russian collusion
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  and Trump's colluding with Russia, they're adding to the pressure against Russia.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  Now, that the Russian press doesn't criticize the U.S. when we bomb hundreds of their people.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Because they understand manipulation, they're actually trying to clean the country up,
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  and that's what our military and Trump said they were going to do.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Thank you, Syrian girl. We'll talk to you soon.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Ever since ID Stronghold created RFID Blocking Wallet technology over 10 years ago,
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  major designer brands have tried to create their own versions.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  But do they really work?
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  Real people test designer brand RFID Blocking Wallets using the same rigorous testing ID Stronghold Wallets go through.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  So how did the designer brands do?
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  I expected notable brands to perform well, and I was pretty surprised to see that it was not fully protected.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising that they do.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Get a Stronghold on your credit cards, license, and other critical data with ID Stronghold Wallets.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  Other RFID Blocking Wallets simply aren't the same.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  ID Stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  I would definitely recommend ID Stronghold Wallets to my friends and family.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  Check the label. If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold Wallet.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Get the most trusted brand in RFID Blocking Wallets and protect yourself from electronic pickpocketing.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.

[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  How many times must I tell you, babe? How many bridges I've got to go?
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  When President Trump gets the information, he makes the right decision for the globalist hating. But he's just a man. He's not perfect. And we've got to continue to put pressure on the Republican Party on him.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  No gun control. Control mental patients. Control police stand downs. Talk about how super rare school shootings are.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  Don't capitulate. We don't want more gun control.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  This article is on infowars.com and newswars.com. It needs to go viral. Park one first responder. I was told to stand down.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  I could have saved lives. The police say they were told to wait till body cams got there. WSVN Miami reports.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  And this is the stuff they're banning on Google, Facebook and Twitter because it scares the system.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  They don't want it to be a narrative about government standing down again for political correctness while they waited for body cams.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  They want to make it about lies that I said nobody died or whatever.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Now, Zach is based in Florida. Zach's a great intel source. I know he is. Great info. We're going to him in just a moment.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  Just briefly here. We have a new product that I'm very, very excited about and to explain how we operate.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  I go out and I look at the industry. I look at what the scientists and the doctors and the researchers and the nutritionists are saying the best.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  And then I notice that stuff tends to be overpriced with low quality in much of the industry of supplements.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  But no one denies that really good fiber, prebiotic fiber, is important.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Well, this is the best source prebiotic fiber that we could come up with with top manufacturers.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  It's concentrated. It's a big ol' cag of it. It's not from these cruddy sources.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  It is the organic apple fruit fiber, organic flax seed, organic blueberry fruit fiber, organic cranberry fruit fiber.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  And a bunch of other stuff that is documented and known to be really, really good for the body.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  So it's our latest product. We're coming out with a full line of the highest quality supplements.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  I'm going to get into the safe documented sports enhancement, pre-workout, post-workout.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  Not that I'm the best out there, but we are getting the best people to develop all this.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  Sign up for auto shipment additional 10% off.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  But it's 1776 right now for a product that most people would sell for 50 bucks that we normally sell for 30.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  So it is 1776 prebiotic fiber, very close to cost.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  But I want you to get it and see how great it is.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  And we're coming out with a new way because I'm going with another big manufacturer that is as good or better than what we have.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  And this is excellent, but that we're going to have a new name for it and stuff as well.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  So we have a limited amount of our true way super high quality 100% cow derived protein.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  It's so good for yourself, your family. It's just pure way.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  So many others are fillers and garbage or they don't test like they say they do.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  This is high quality. It is 50% off until it sells out probably just in a week or so.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  DNA force at 60 plus percent off because we're coming out with new DNA force plus.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  We're able to get the same stuff at a much lower price.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  So we're able to lower the price on it.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  It's 67% off, but that's going to stop today because it is at cost.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  It is at cost. That's what it costs.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  There's $49 or really more of product in every bottle of DNA force.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  Now I'm able to get it for 30 bucks.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  So I've lowered the overall MSRP.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  So you got a 1117 reviews from power reviews, 96% review.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  They were selling it for $200 to $400 to $500 at medical facilities,
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  but people would pay and it wasn't prescription as the doctor said.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  And there'd be like 60 bucks or 30 bucks in the bottle.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Bio PQQ CoQ 10 and other key cofactors.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  And I just said, what does this really cost?
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  They're like, well, it'll be $45, $50 a bottle depending on the run.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  You're signing your contract, maybe 40 bucks a bottle, but that's a lot of money.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  You got to pay a lot of it up front.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  And then, you know, people think you're selling something for 100 bucks.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  You know, it must be a ripoff.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  No, it'd be 300 bucks everywhere else.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  We've gone out and being able to, we're selling so much of it now to get it for $30 a bottle.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  Signed a year contract on that.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  And so now we're going to sell it for 60, 70, 80 bucks.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  Funded operation, but you're sending little bottles of bio PQQ that are synthetic or 50 bucks.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  It doesn't do anything when it's synthetic.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Little tiny bottles are 50 bucks.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  This is a big giant bottle filled to the top of bio PQQ and CoQ 10 and all of it.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  It's just ridiculous.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  And so sell force is about to sell out.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  It's going to be the new DNA force plus it's discounted.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  You've also got this, but it's all in him because it's selling out.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  It's like the toothpaste in.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Okay, I'm done ranting.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  That's how we funded operation.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  Please support our local affiliates.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  You can see they're trying to shut us down everywhere.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  A bunch of the specials ended because they sold out or they got right at selling out.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  And so we're going to coast out until the new stuff comes in.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  But we've got new sales, including the new best source.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  I'm going to change the name once it comes out with the new label.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  Cause right now it's just called prebiotic fiber.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  But I mean, we, we didn't have the best source or best ingredients.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  We've got to see what's trademark, but I mean, it's, it's, it's the best you can get.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  And it's still not that much.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  They just mark up the average supplement seven times.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  We mark it up a hundred times, you know, not a hundred, I mean 100%.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  Uh, and then that's how we pay the bills.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  You get high quality.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  So you get high quality at a low price.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  Joining us is Zach.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  I know who Zach is.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  He has been in military intelligence.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  He's been in news articles.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  He's been on national news.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  And he has given us impeccable intel that checked out with our FBI sources,
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  the checked out with our other military sources, Navy SEAL sources,
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Delta force sources, uh, White House sources, uh, CIA sources, just very accurate.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  He's just giving you what the thinking is of some of the smartest people that are
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  interfaced with stuff.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  He's not giving you classified stuff.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  So we've got a short segment here, a long segment coming up.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  So Zach joins us to give us what's going on with the shooting, Florida,
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  the, the rollout against free speech, what's happening in the Middle East,
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  just what's going on in Trump land here.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  So Zach, thank you for joining us.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Yes, Alex.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  It's a great week back on and have the opportunity to connect some dots.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  There's obviously a lot of moving pieces right now.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  So we got to get into it, but just to piggyback there on the, uh,
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  Syria info that wasn't, this wasn't brought up.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  And this just just now breaking, and we could look it up in real time as I'm
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  talking about it.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  Um, what's going on in Syria right now?
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  This just got discovered.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  North Korea is being used to false flag Syria in World War three.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  I know that sounds sensational, but go ahead and start looking it up.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  New York Times put the story out here a couple hours ago, maybe a couple minutes
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  ago, there are pressure to do it by decent factions within the UN that we
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  force their hand.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  Um, this sounds pretty fantastical, but it's, this is a reality.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  So there are some trade programs going on with factions in Syria and
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  North Korean groups or whatever.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  We have to realize that North Korea is a Chinese deep state backed bank.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  So we would say, why would they be helping them?
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  Well, this is the deep state and the communists trying to sabotage us and
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  get us into a World War three with by proxy Russia.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  This is happening.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  The stories are out there.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  40 containers were discovered, you know, stuff that we know,
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  the chlorine based weapons, all of this stuff.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  So not only are they trying to sabotage the talks legitimately,
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  we're having with North Korea.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  They're trying to tie them into this red line fiasco in Syria and kick
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  off a major, major global war.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  All while they are doing the same thing here in the States,
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  which we could get into the big problems in Broward County.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  They continued false flags and not to mention the information coming out of
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  Cambridge and the Turkish group, which is the digital false flag info.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  So we have quite a, quite a number of things to get into.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  So we can kind of start picking out a message like, okay, we've got a
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  minute, start with one of them.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  Okay.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  So the North Korean stuff is pretty important.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  The Syria issue over the weekend, you have 60 minutes and Scott Pelley
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  putting out the expose of tugging on the heartstrings that there was a
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  chemical attack in Syria that occurred, that is accurate.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  A chemical attack did occur, but it did not occur by the Assad forces.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  Let's just be clear.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  That's ridiculous.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  That's suicidal.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  We know it didn't happen by then.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  It was the quote unquote rebel groups that got the capability in
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  the North Korea.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  They were the containers shipped from North Korea on record.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  They were discovered by UN workers there, you know, on the ground, and
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  they were forced, they were forced there to report it.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  And this is what's going on on the ground right now in Syria, which ties
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  into a big, bigger global issue and, you know, kind of a tug of war power.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  But this is pretty critical information because this is not just some
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  accident.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  This is showing the real issues of strategic patience on the Korean
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  peninsula and really what it's going to do.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  How deep does it really go around the globe?
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Wow.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  So it sounds like a type of false flag.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  We know they've caught the al-Qaeda ISIS forces before staging chemical
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  false flags, but they got caught.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  We know it didn't happen by then.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:48.400]  That means it's clean.
[1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:49.400]  That means it's pure.
[1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:50.400]  And red secured.
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:52.400]  You're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:55.240]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:02.240]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:07.280]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:12.520]  just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic,
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:16.600]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:22.240]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:24.240]  right now are absolutely amazing.
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:25.240]  Well, thank you.
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:30.240]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me, but it says Won't Tread on Me, and it's
[1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:35.000]  a big Daeglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  the right arm.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:41.360]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  free speech.
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:47.880]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-Shirt, Trigger Warning T-Shirt, which is the symbol
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:52.360]  of a trigger with a yield sign in the InfoWars.com on the back.
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:47:01.720]  That is the new shirt of the mind, available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:31.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:34.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:38.920]  I'm not going to delve into this, but DrudgeReport.com is linked to it right now.
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:42.280]  InfoWars, one strike away from YouTube ban.
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:43.280]  That's the Hill.
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:47.320]  Now again, on Friday, CNN said they filed the complaints.
[1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:50.800]  They got one strike to ban us having live streams.
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:57.440]  Another strike froze the account, and then the Hill says, Jones claims it's part of
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:01.040]  a CNN lobbying campaign, but never even points out.
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:02.640]  They said they're behind it.
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:05.040]  They filed the complaints.
[1:48:05.040 --> 1:48:09.760]  So see, mainstream media out of hundreds of articles will never even tell you that another
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:14.200]  news organization known for fake news, CNN, is trying to shut us down.
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:20.080]  That's so sensational, but the bigger news is, in triangulating this, chemical weapons,
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:23.280]  they've tried this three times, they've launched them twice, saying that the Syrian government
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:29.440]  launched it, but the Islamists love to, the ISIS forces, love to say that, you know, videotape
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:32.400]  it for fame and fortune.
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:36.280]  And so they always videotape themselves doing it, but this new case, they found some of
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:38.840]  it, and they're now saying, oh, look, Syria's behind it.
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:42.280]  Who's trying to kick off the big war, break it down, and let's get into all the other
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:48.800]  things that are happening, the school shooting, the climate, the whole situations act.
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:54.840]  Yes, and it all ties together because, and it's no coincidence that Trump makes his
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:59.560]  announcement for 2020 because he has to see who's really on his side here, it's unprecedented
[1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:00.560]  to come up this early.
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:04.600]  And he has to do this because we are in an absolute war.
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:08.640]  It's happening right now, Jerome Corsi has hinted to it, the military tribunals are being
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:09.640]  set up.
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:14.640]  This is, there's so many issues going on around the world, and it's really incredible, but
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:18.520]  it's the latest thing in Syria, this is obvious, false flag.
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:22.080]  They're blaming the Assad regime, which is completely ridiculous, and by blaming the
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:27.480]  Assad regime, they're really tying Russia into it and really putting it at odds with
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:31.800]  Russia and trying to get Trump to do something here with the red lines with the general,
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:36.360]  some of the global political thinkers there at the White House, which is very dangerous.
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:39.000]  There's still a real threat in the Middle East right now, but we're distracted at home
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  with these other issues that I believe are fabricated.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.040]  In fact, I know a lot of them are fabricated at home, they're really distracted, and they're
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:50.720]  double barbed to take individuals like you, your organizations out, push the internet
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:54.280]  censorship, do all this at the same time, because we have their number with Trump in
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:58.400]  the White House, and they have to pull out all the stops, otherwise they are done, and
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:00.080]  they know that the writing's on the walls.
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:06.360]  They know that Guantanamo's being emptied, they know that their power brokers, that their
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:12.200]  financiers are going to be prosecuted, and they're going to try their darkness to assassinate
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:17.880]  our president, but if they cannot do that, they are going to kill people at country music
[1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:21.480]  festivals, they are going to kill kids in schools, they are going to start wars around
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:26.400]  the globe, they are going to crash the economy, because they are done and they are guilty.
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:30.120]  If you were in their shoes and you thought like they would, it's not that hard to come
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:34.280]  up with a conclusion, and I can tell you in real time this is happening, and when you
[1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:38.320]  go to Broward County, you've got big problems in Broward County with Sheriff Israel and
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:42.480]  his heavy connections to the deep state and the far less factions, especially the Clinton
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:43.480]  Crime family.
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:49.160]  Not to mention that he's hired as a deputy sheriff there in Broward County, in Broward
[1:50:49.160 --> 1:50:52.640]  County, Nazar Hamzee, and who is Nazar Hamzee?
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:58.000]  Nazar Hamzee is the former head honcho out of Tampa, Florida, who cares the counsel on
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:02.760]  American Islamic relations, which is really a deep state and Muslim brotherhood and major
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:04.760]  political players, what they are.
[1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:08.960]  That's exactly what they are, and this guy was the head honcho out of the Tampa office,
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:12.040]  which is the pinnacle of care in this country.
[1:51:12.040 --> 1:51:15.840]  So, he went out of his way to hire Mr. Hamzee in Broward County.
[1:51:15.840 --> 1:51:19.640]  I can't get into certain speculations on what happened that day in that school.
[1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:20.800]  Of course, kids have died.
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:23.400]  The question is, how was this allowed to happen?
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:25.280]  What's the deeper story and what's going on?
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:26.600]  This is not an isolated event.
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:29.600]  These have been going on in a timeline in this country since Trump has been elected,
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:34.920]  and it's obvious, but they're going to guilt and shame patriots for even speaking about
[1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:36.920]  this, which is their tactic.
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:40.840]  And they're even pushing Trump here because Trump is going to, he's meeting with the governors
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:45.680]  and he is going to push some sort of un-control, very limited by something, and with his major
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:49.800]  base is going to have major delicate implications in 2020, so they're going to do everything
[1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:54.840]  they can not to have him in 2020, and if they can't assassinate him physically, they will
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:51:58.080]  attempt to do it politically by forcing his hand here.
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:03.320]  Well, I know what he does, where he'll do something that sounds reasonable, so then
[1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:06.560]  they ask for everything, and then he doesn't have to do anything knowing it's all a fraud,
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:11.360]  just like he did with the whole dreamer situation, but I still just don't know why he'd make
[1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:15.720]  this move because they want total gun bans, they're never going to give up.
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:21.480]  Well, it's so complicated now when you have dead children, they've stopped at nothing,
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:23.280]  there's dead kids now.
[1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:27.360]  They are psychopaths out of control, there's dead kids now, so there has to be a reaction,
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:30.600]  and it's just like, what do you do, you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:31.600]  do something here.
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:35.440]  He has to do something, I mean, there's a political reality to that, but let's just
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:39.360]  get into what's going on in Broward County with the sheriff Israel, which is deep state
[1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:44.720]  connected, no question about it, his downfall, I think, should be the hiring of the deputy
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:49.280]  sheriff, Nazar Hanzi, and Nazar Hanzi works for care, and the reason I keep on bringing
[1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:54.160]  care up is because I'm very, very aware of care, let's just say real close to care.
[1:52:54.160 --> 1:52:59.080]  Well, I was in the military in 2009, I did an event with them in Tallahassee called
[1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:03.760]  Florida Muslim Capital Day, where they use these organizations to go to state capitals
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:08.600]  and kind of bully and lobby legislators in the actual capitals, and this is a political
[1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:12.640]  arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, make no mistake, and I just saw what they were doing, I understood
[1:53:12.640 --> 1:53:17.120]  what they were doing, and my position in the military obviously had me interacting and
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:22.240]  kind of utilizing them in certain capacities, and what I saw was incredible what's going
[1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:28.640]  on out of care, and care is not just some shy little, hey, we're just a SJW, political
[1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:35.200]  pro-Muslim organization, they are a Muslim Brotherhood, a filiated group, make no mistakes,
[1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:40.280]  they're just on our shores, and that's without question, and out of Tampa, Florida, there's
[1:53:40.280 --> 1:53:44.600]  some real issues coming out of that branch out of Tampa, Florida, which Mr. Hanzi ran,
[1:53:44.600 --> 1:53:49.200]  so you want to talk about having a separation of church and state, these guys are in our
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:54.800]  capitals, on March 5th through the 9th in Oklahoma at the capitol there, they're having
[1:53:54.800 --> 1:54:00.280]  one of their next Muslim capitol days, and this stuff kind of gets pushed under the rug,
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:05.800]  but you have to understand, when we had another administration in the White House working with
[1:54:05.800 --> 1:54:12.400]  these NGOs and other 501C3s, the things that were being done, the sanctuary cities, the
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:14.120]  Syrian refugees being brought in for you.
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:19.200]  This is a rebellion, this is a total breakaway where they tell MS-13 that ICE is coming to
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:23.840]  get them in Oakland, it's sedition and expanding on that, it's not even bashing Muslims, it's
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:28.960]  the special Muslim Brotherhood groups, look what Turkey's doing, right there in Europe
[1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:35.480]  they're setting up at every capitol their own Turkish party saying do what Turkey says,
[1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:40.320]  so these are Turkish citizens saying they're there to basically conquer Europe, and the
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:44.280]  politicians, the Western politicians want this because it's part of a larger global
[1:54:44.280 --> 1:54:46.680]  takeover, that's what's happening.
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:53.120]  Yeah, care is not looking out for the faith, it's not looking out for most of Americans
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:58.760]  in the country, care is faith pimping, they are using the faith as a whole to get in and
[1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:02.640]  make political moves, they're not, yeah, they're in the community doing some things, but they
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:08.280]  are in capitals doing things, they are getting people in the legislator, they're getting
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:12.760]  peace elephant in Minnesota, they're in the legislators, they are in the political system,
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:16.760]  they're tied to the Awan brothers, they were deeply entrenched in the Obama administration,
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:21.040]  they are deeply entrenched with the Clinton family, and ICE has firsthand knowledge in
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:27.440]  2009 where I was talking and communicating with the very, very, very top of the funding
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:32.640]  helms out of English, but you know, home.
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:37.760]  Start over, your phone broke up at that critical point, Zach, you were talking the very top,
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:43.400]  the very top of the funding helms of care out of Tampa, Florida, Saudi Arabia, who get
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:48.160]  their marching orders from Saudi Arabia, and I was involved obviously in, I really can't
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:54.120]  get it, some work in the United States military where, let's just say it involves the Fort Hood
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:56:00.280]  shooting, many plots, all these shootings around here, these groups, these political
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:03.880]  groups are instrumental in getting these people handpicking these individuals.
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:07.560]  Well we know Major Hassan was in communication with Al Qaeda for two years, the CIA knew about
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:12.000]  the attack months before and didn't stop him, same thing now with this attack, and by false
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.200]  flag they're letting them happen bare minimum, why would you do that?
[1:56:16.200 --> 1:56:21.360]  You have to, they're in their death hurdle, there's military tribunals coming, I don't
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:25.480]  think people understand what's going on right now, Donald Trump signing an executive order
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:31.960]  which put our nation into a state of emergency, in this case in the legal right to hold military
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:36.280]  tribunals, these are happening, Guantanamo had a chain of command shuffle.
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:40.760]  And you agree though, clearly that's the first thing I thought, 980 days out, he's doing
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:44.160]  this to show who's loyal and who isn't, because he knows Romney's getting ready to run against
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:48.640]  him, but acting like a friend, that way they have to all endorse him now, and that kills
[1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:52.320]  the whole fake Republican field, it's a very smart move.
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:55.560]  You're gonna see exactly where people lie there, and after the shooting, he's not, he
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:59.280]  understood, he's getting real savvy in the political sphere of things, but they forced
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:04.280]  his hand here, listen, this is the ruthlessness of the deep state, there's dead children
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:09.080]  here, there's dead concert goers, there's starting, there's kids that were hit by chemical
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:12.720]  attacks in Syria, but this will not be a sovereignty, these are the same people killing
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:16.680]  the kids in Miami that are dropping chemical weapons in Syria, the same money's behind
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:17.680]  it.
[1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:21.160]  Well, I mean we got teachers and students reporting men in quote army guard, and the
[1:57:21.160 --> 1:57:25.920]  police stand down outside, and now the stand downs confirmed, and we even speculate they
[1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:29.960]  ban us, since when are you not supposed to in America, when you have the reports of
[1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:34.200]  the stand down, and you've got somebody like you that's got the credentials to not talk
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:39.040]  about it, it's incredible, and this just shows the purge, and if we give into this, we'll
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:40.040]  give into everything.
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:44.200]  But I legitimately said I don't think it's crisis actors in a false flag, but then the
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:47.400]  evidence starts to mount that they stood down.
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:53.160]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:59.200]  encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems,

[1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:57.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:12.560]  You've found it, the front lines of the human awakening.
[2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:17.320]  It's the Infowar and now, Alex Jones.
[2:00:17.320 --> 2:00:22.920]  Josh Limbaugh has picked up our report dealing with the sheriff's deputies shielding criminal
[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:25.240]  activity in Broward County for many years.
[2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:29.400]  There's a major scandal with the previous sheriff.
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:34.000]  And all I know is that they banned our videos on YouTube that had nothing to do with saying
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:40.520]  they were crisis actors, but they were students on local news, on national news, and that
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:44.680]  we talked to all saying the same thing, that they saw crews while the shooting was going
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:49.680]  on, that it was men in full garb, completely covered, that they were taking body bags out
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:53.200]  as the police were there throwing the backs of trucks, and we have video from choppers
[2:00:53.200 --> 2:00:56.040]  of body bags being thrown in while the shooting's still going on.
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:01:00.240]  I don't know what's going on, but you got David Hogg being fed lines.
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:04.800]  I'm not saying he wasn't there, just he's obviously a spokesman for the gun lobby, anti-gun
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:05.800]  lobby.
[2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:11.120]  And then bizarre video, David Hogg's sister lost four best friends, then two, then three,
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:15.400]  and Facebook journalists have been kicked off if they share the video, so I've green-lighted
[2:01:15.400 --> 2:01:18.280]  this going up, and they're going to ban us anyways, folks.
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:19.280]  We have to fight back.
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:20.280]  We have to spread the word.
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:25.760]  YouTube's had to back off after doing a second strike and banning the channel.
[2:01:25.760 --> 2:01:28.320]  And I guess they're like, no, we got to find a better video, because in that video he said
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:30.280]  they weren't crisis actors.
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:34.800]  But Zach is well-known, he's not giving his last name, he's been involved in famous anti-terrorism
[2:01:34.800 --> 2:01:38.640]  cases, and he lives there in Florida.
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:42.240]  He's involved, obviously, and different things are on there.
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:45.480]  And you're saying that this is part of a deep state operation.
[2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:51.560]  All I know is we're being very judicious about this, and none of it adds up, and that CNN's
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:55.840]  having fake town halls, and then they're using this to ban everybody, and famous baseball
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:00.440]  players simply say these kids look coached, and they're kicked out of the baseball hall
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:01.880]  of fame or not allowed in.
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:04.080]  I mean, what happened to free speech here?
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:06.080]  I mean, we know they're attacking that.
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:11.160]  Yeah, absolutely, they're just going to shame and guilt people into this, and it's the same
[2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:14.400]  sort of thinking behind pushing Trump's hand here to actually do something that's going
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:16.840]  to cause him some friction with his base.
[2:02:16.840 --> 2:02:20.920]  And it's sick, and it's out of control, this is the type of enemies we got.
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:28.800]  And all this is going on, meanwhile, on a AI front, we have to get into this, because
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:33.760]  this is critical, and I know that you're experiencing, obviously, a lot of disruption will call it
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:37.880]  on your psych service, and the like there, because it's obvious what's going on, you're
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:42.360]  being attacked, and now we have individuals, well, it's well known in Silicon Valley, with
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:45.840]  some of the de-sinfections, the majority are out of their minds in Silicon Valley, but
[2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:49.880]  there are some de-sinfections who knew the worries of these AI systems.
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:53.320]  They're worried about jobs being taken, but before that, it's going to get into what I'm
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:55.280]  about to discuss.
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:59.720]  And so just to preface this, everyone, just to let everybody know, the Chinese Premier
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:02.080]  is essentially becoming anointed in China.
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:06.200]  If it's supposed to be the Chinese Century, Trump kind of derailed that, our economy's
[2:03:06.200 --> 2:03:10.000]  back on its feet, and now, all of a sudden, you're seeing the Chinese also pull out all
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.600]  the stops, because they're not happy about the prosperity of America, which they also
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:16.840]  hold a lot of debt of and everything else.
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:21.520]  So I just got to preface with the Chinese situation, because what we have here being
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:27.000]  broken out publicly, we knew this, the people who knew knew this, but publicly, out of Cambridge,
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:30.920]  the Dark Trace Group has finally come out with what's going on online.
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:38.760]  This major AI system, which is putting malicious software onto people's computers, organizations'
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:43.400]  computers and software, anything smart, laptops, phones, computers, and what they're doing
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:48.160]  with the software is gathering all your messages, they're gathering all of your emails, they're
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:52.680]  gathering all of your calendars, all of your itineraries, everything.
[2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:57.240]  This has been being uploaded to an AI system that learns how to mimic the way you talk,
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:00.280]  the way you interact, and also who you're talking to.
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:04.640]  So once they also get into your computer, it then drags that to whoever you're talking
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:06.480]  about and repeats that process.
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:09.880]  And then hold on, then it can engage, let's come back from break, and we'll get more time
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:10.880]  with you in the potential.
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:11.880]  Come on.
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:16.200]  Then it can launch a AI war, making everybody fight with each other, mimicking friends, family,
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:20.200]  neighbors to cause societal collapse, is that what you're getting into is the ultimate
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:21.200]  weapon.
[2:04:21.200 --> 2:04:23.560]  You know, the King's been talking about a wavelength being projected out of the phones,
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:27.480]  which we know they have that stuff, but we're talking about beyond that, where the AI calls,
[2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:32.160]  texts and messages does all this, and I've read about this, to then cause massive social
[2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:33.160]  distortion.
[2:04:33.160 --> 2:04:37.280]  If you think all the race war talks bad, if you think them saying, we said things we
[2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:41.160]  didn't say and put in all of the news, that's primitive high-tech information, where we're
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:46.080]  talking about beyond that, and Apple's moving its main base to China, merging with them
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:51.080]  and giving all the IDs of Apple users to the Chinese Communist government to launch a giant
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:57.320]  AI attack out of China, they've chosen sites.
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:00.680]  Supporting Cellforce by InfoWarsLife
[2:05:00.680 --> 2:05:04.760]  Cellforce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:07.520]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:10.520]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[2:05:10.520 --> 2:05:14.840]  Cellforce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[2:05:14.840 --> 2:05:17.320]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:21.800]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:24.240]  reactive oxygen species.
[2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:29.400]  Stop scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:32.280]  these reactive oxygen species.
[2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:37.360]  The antioxidants found in Cellforce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[2:05:37.360 --> 2:05:42.160]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:44.960]  species and other free radicals.

[2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:30.600]  Jones Show.
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:35.400]  We're finishing up with Zach, a great intelligence source, who's proven very, very accurate.
[2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:40.000]  He was getting into the different AI systems, the different power blocks in the world.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:43.880]  When Apple has announced it's moving to China, they're accepting the zero tax plan, they're
[2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:48.080]  going to merge with the Communist Party, China announced five weeks ago to counter Trump,
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:53.760]  they just said move here, no taxes, but you've got to let the people's party control you.
[2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:57.560]  Now the president's becoming a dictator, he's already a dictator of the Politburo and the
[2:06:57.560 --> 2:07:00.560]  Central Committee, but now he's a true dictator if this goes through.
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:02.240]  And I just saw a headline in there.
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:06.960]  Can you put that headline up guys, that I was talking about, where someone in the public
[2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:13.560]  sphere told a story that wasn't sexually explicit and wasn't sexual but could be construed
[2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:15.960]  as interpreted as sexual harassment.
[2:07:15.960 --> 2:07:22.960]  So the mental illness level fired League of Legends coach, the story I told wasn't sexually
[2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:27.280]  explicit but could be constructed or interpreted as sexual harassment.
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:31.080]  That's the next level of this stuff.
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:36.760]  And here it is, YouTube hits Alex Jones with a second strike, watch these banned videos.
[2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:40.560]  We're standing in lobbies to have competing media platform removed and we have an update.
[2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:44.400]  They've now removed the second strike because the video is the opposite of what they said
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:48.920]  but you can see it there and it's only because we have our own platform that they had to
[2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:49.920]  do that.
[2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:53.400]  We're going to finish up with Zach and then go to Dr. Steve Pacenek to give us an update
[2:07:53.400 --> 2:07:55.800]  on his take on all this.
[2:07:55.800 --> 2:08:00.840]  So finishing up Zach, you were getting into AI computers, being able to mimic humans,
[2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:03.640]  getting all your databases to then do what?
[2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:08.440]  Yes, and then also, so they're using those, getting the computers, getting the information,
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:12.240]  learning how to mimic you in real time and then also on everyone's phone, computer,
[2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:16.760]  all these things, they're using the transcript and transcription, excuse me, the transcript
[2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:20.160]  and translation service that's picking up audio in real time.
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:22.560]  So it's spying on you in real time, you've been talking about this for years, but this
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:27.560]  is a part of the AI system that's being, so when you're entering in passwords, when you're
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:33.400]  talking about plans, when you're talking about location of servers, passwords in the
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:37.360]  server, passwords into everything, they're getting it in real time and they're going
[2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:41.400]  to be, they're clipping audio, they're doing things and where this all leads right now,
[2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:42.560]  it's just sabotage.
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:47.040]  So you're going to have some disruption coming to your site, maybe when you run a store there,
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:51.200]  so there might be unfulfilled orders or something in your own carts and stuff like that.
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:56.560]  But what it's ultimately leading to is digital false flags, where once this AI really learns
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:00.200]  who you are and they can physically recreate you and digitally from your...
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:06.560]  It will have you go and the AI will create a whole, even a video of you in sex chat,
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:12.280]  believing you're talking to a five-year-old girl and then it will artificially frame you.
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:17.720]  Yes, they'll start something minimal that's social shaming, but then they'll get into...
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:22.840]  It'll have you order drugs online, they get shipped to your house, but basically the next
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:23.840]  level of spoofing.
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:28.080]  Yes, it's coming and right now it's going to start at sabotage, hopefully they can knock
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:32.640]  you off that way and have the public just do their bidding, because who needs crisis
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:36.560]  actors when you have full spectrum dominance, if these kids really are brainwashed and believe
[2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:37.560]  it is what it is.
[2:09:37.560 --> 2:09:42.360]  I'm not going to go there, but listen, things aren't what they seem and people don't want
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:44.440]  to come out and say it due to retribution.
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:48.480]  We are in a war, this is not the first false flag, this is one of many and it won't be
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:49.480]  the last.
[2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:54.080]  They're forcing their hand, the tribunals are coming and all of these things were discussed
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:56.640]  and lead into this point.
[2:09:56.640 --> 2:10:03.680]  The military tribunals are coming and they were supposed to release six detainees from
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:04.680]  Guantanamo last week.
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:07.680]  That didn't happen, they were going to release one of them in the Saudi Arabian custody and
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:11.680]  then people need to look into the names, but look into exactly who this individual is,
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:15.480]  because if you don't think that these guys aren't talking to our current administration,
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:16.480]  you're wrong.
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:20.960]  They are so found out, they are so guilty of what they've done overseas in these wars
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:26.560]  with these individuals who are exing Guantanamo, that they're done and this is a tough thing.
[2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:27.560]  Why hasn't it already happened?
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:29.160]  When is this going to happen?
[2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:34.760]  When this occurs, it will be the biggest kinetic shift in the world ever that the world's
[2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:35.760]  ever seen.
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:42.040]  We're talking about people in the Ombaba administration all the way up to Barak himself being tried,
[2:10:42.040 --> 2:10:46.800]  because when you pull things off like you did in Libya and you did in Iraq initially
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:51.280]  and the real information that we have on Saddam Hussein, the real information on the State
[2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:54.720]  Department dealing with Muammar Gaddafi, you have a big, big problem.
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:59.360]  So yeah, you better do everything in your power to either set this country into, set
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:02.920]  this country in this world in the World War III or kill the President of the United States
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:08.400]  if you're them and believe me, they are trying every day, because they are so guilty on a
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:14.680]  karmatic and global historical scale that I don't even know how they maintain consciousness.
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:19.520]  Once this is revealed at the end of this year, when these things start occurring, if they
[2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:23.440]  don't set this world on fire, we'll change the world obviously forever.
[2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:25.840]  So they're doing everything they can.
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:31.240]  They are in a deep state death hurdle going towards the inevitable, but they're not going
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:32.800]  to go down without a fight.
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:38.360]  These are kids who are killed trying to force us into a position politically to get out
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:45.600]  of control and kill our own all while starting World War III in Syria and the Korean Peninsula
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:46.600]  simultaneously.
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:47.600]  This is sick.
[2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:48.600]  This is fantastic.
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:56.680]  You cannot write this script, and if you even question it, you're shamed, you're guilty
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:01.360]  by association, you're burned at the stake, and it won't be the end of us because the
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:06.080]  people who are doing the less bidding and the deep state bidding, I just want to let
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:07.080]  you guys know.
[2:12:07.080 --> 2:12:08.080]  There's no loyalty.
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:11.360]  If you think it stops with Alex Jones, if you think it stops with InfoWords, if you think
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:17.160]  it stops with Donald J. Trump, what's going to happen in 10 years when you're the target?
[2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:18.160]  It's bigger than this.
[2:12:18.160 --> 2:12:19.160]  This is a fight for humanity.
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:26.120]  This is a fight for the right, and this is unprecedented what's going on, but I just
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:30.860]  hope Trump has the wherewithal to really go through with it because really doing this
[2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:32.360]  is going to shake the world.
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:36.080]  I mean, they've already got hundreds of cities saying they're telling MS-13 when the police
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:37.080]  are coming.
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:38.680]  They're in total sedition.
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:43.520]  The Democrats are running around psychopathically saying kill all the NRA members.
[2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:47.560]  They've turned their minions into frothing violent people on the street, and these blue
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:49.640]  areas are like cancers.
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:50.640]  They're the ones attacking.
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:52.400]  Zach, I really appreciate your time.
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:53.400]  You're a great patriot.
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:12:54.400]  Your Info is always amazing.
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:55.400]  Thank you so much.
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:12:56.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:57.400]  Pleasure to be on.
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:12:58.400]  All right.
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.360]  We've got Dr. Steve Pachennick for the balance of the hour, and he's a bona fide guy in the
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:06.720]  work he's done in the government, the state department, and other agencies.
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:12.120]  But Zach, I know who Zach is, but he finally told us who he was, but I had some other sources
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:14.920]  that, hey, that's a good guy to have on, and the intelligence operations he was involved
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:15.920]  in.
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:21.080]  He's been in the newspapers, he exposed when they knew terror attacks were coming and didn't
[2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:22.080]  do anything about it.
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:23.240]  He mentioned Major Hassan.
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:25.880]  He was in the news for that, and people want to figure it out.
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:29.720]  His lawyers don't want him to say his name because he's now out of the Army and works
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:33.440]  with some private groups, but he's basically been authorized to come on the show and say
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:34.440]  the things.
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:38.440]  But Pachennick's not in the agencies anymore, but he comes on as a citizen and gives his
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:43.440]  take on it, but this is a hell of a time we're in right now, and the Democrats have launched
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:44.440]  a full war.
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:48.560]  And what I harped on this censorship thing is, when you do block it, when you do talk
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:52.000]  about it, when you do expose it, they back off, and they've had to remove one of the
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:55.160]  strikes, and they've said, we're the test case.
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:14:00.240]  But Jerome Corsi had his thing, a video about 2018, Trump will strike back.
[2:14:00.240 --> 2:14:04.160]  He just laid out that Trump's going to take action, it wasn't calls for violence, anything.
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:06.640]  They banned that video, and it blocked Corsi's channel.
[2:14:06.640 --> 2:14:08.520]  So they're running scared.
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:09.520]  We're going to break in a minute.
[2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:13.400]  I want to get into any issues you want to cover, just the waterfront, but what do you
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:16.480]  make of just the current climate right now?
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:19.960]  The criminal elements of the deep state are in full panic mode.
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:26.840]  Let me say this, there's a term for what's happening right now, and Zack has hit part
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:28.040]  of it.
[2:14:28.040 --> 2:14:31.560]  And the term is called the apocalypse of information.
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:38.680]  And this was a term that my people, in intelligence, namely those who care about the state, the
[2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:43.280]  republic, there are many of them there, they're far greater than anything in the deep state
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:45.920]  on the left or whatever you might imagine.
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:50.640]  There is a serious problem, which is true, and it's occurring right now.
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:58.480]  Misperception, deception, and distortion of reality is the new reality on both sides.
[2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:05.080]  So Zack is not exaggerating, except it's happening both on the republican side and on the left.
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:11.600]  What we're in right now is an Alice in Wonderland world, where you can't assess credibility.
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:16.440]  The reason you have always been important and will continue to be important and I guarantee
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:22.800]  you those with whom I work have given me that information is to say that you are creating
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:30.040]  the point of credibility so that we can test out the false flags of Sandy Hook, of what
[2:15:30.040 --> 2:15:37.040]  happened here in Parkland, and various other elements, as well as the fact of 9-11.
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:42.820]  So remember, you stay in the neutral line, where a fact is fact and we can check the
[2:15:42.820 --> 2:15:45.360]  credibility, but now fact has become...
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:47.880]  Stay there, because this is critical, because anybody could have done this.
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:49.480]  We actually try to tell the truth.
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:53.960]  We don't try Machiavellian manipulation, and that is revolutionary in a world of universal
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:15:55.880]  deceit.
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:15:58.440]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[2:15:58.440 --> 2:16:00.580]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[2:16:00.580 --> 2:16:02.760]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:04.720]  Find your happiness with pure soap.
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:09.480]  These all-natural, earth-friendly, pure soaps are the very best you've ever used.

[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:21.600]  natural soaps.

[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:04.520]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:27.080]  healthier I feel.

[2:17:56.880 --> 2:18:01.360]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com, but instead
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:04.840]  of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:09.960]  From all the wives, tales, and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:12.600]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:19.720]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works, and there's no way to quantify
[2:18:19.720 --> 2:18:24.840]  how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:30.680]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:34.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:39.880]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:46.720]  this is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:50.960]  Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com, what you can do for your family, and again,
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:52.640]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:56.840]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[2:18:56.840 --> 2:19:00.160]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:04.920]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:09.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:11.680]  health and normal breathing.
[2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:12.680]  This is pollen blood.
[2:19:12.680 --> 2:19:18.040]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:24.200]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes,
[2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:25.680]  and excessive mucus production.
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:30.520]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:36.680]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[2:19:36.680 --> 2:19:41.440]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:45.000]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:49.400]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at
[2:19:49.400 --> 2:20:18.400]  Infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[2:20:19.400 --> 2:20:35.880]  Now what Dr. Steve Pacenek was just saying, I want to show you back live is really important
[2:20:35.880 --> 2:20:41.040]  because you have this information singularity is what I've called it, but I didn't know
[2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:47.840]  about this term from intelligence agencies decades ago, information apocalypse where
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:51.760]  you can lie and manipulate for a while, but once everybody starts doing it, it just creates
[2:20:51.760 --> 2:20:55.280]  a fog of war for everyone and will break down the culture.
[2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:59.240]  Just like this Me Too movement, Hollywood used its own baggage coming out, to then
[2:20:59.240 --> 2:21:03.480]  now if a man says a woman looks nice or a man says it's a beautiful day, that's harassment
[2:21:03.480 --> 2:21:07.840]  or a woman hugs you and her shirt comes up, you pat her back, the Prairie Home companion
[2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:09.680]  guy gets fired.
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:13.920]  So it's culture warfare, it's in the WikiLeaks they're doing it, we know about it, it's thousands
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:15.160]  of years old.
[2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:20.480]  But now it's sophisticated, but once you use it, it spins out of control and it's designed
[2:21:20.480 --> 2:21:25.160]  to balkanize societies that you're conquering, but this will bring them down and I think
[2:21:25.160 --> 2:21:31.680]  that's what Dr. Pacenek is getting into, but he's the psychological expert on this.
[2:21:31.680 --> 2:21:36.080]  We do try to tell the truth, we make mistakes, we say it, but all we see is instead of having
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:40.360]  a debate and talking to the victims or talking to Congress or talking to them and then finding
[2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:46.200]  out what the best minds think, they immediately have a talking point and then we try to take
[2:21:46.200 --> 2:21:51.120]  the middle road and really figure out what's going on, they then misrepresent and then
[2:21:51.120 --> 2:21:52.280]  are trying to remove us.
[2:21:52.280 --> 2:21:55.920]  They just told us our oldest and biggest sponsors being attacked, they've taken almost all of
[2:21:55.920 --> 2:22:00.920]  them, rev content and there's a big move now to attack them and remove all their sponsors
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:05.080]  and kick them off all their platforms they're on, if they continue to just have ads running
[2:22:05.080 --> 2:22:09.520]  on info wars that are maybe 5% of the money we bring in, but that's the thing, they just
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:14.280]  keep hacking everything off, it's actually made it stronger though making us go purely
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:18.680]  resiliently to you and to the affiliates and everybody and people recognize what's happening,
[2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:23.360]  but we're able like a lighthouse on a promontory to stay there at least for now, for the average
[2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:27.600]  person involved they get scared they back down, so this bullying against info wars is
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:31.400]  about a message to everybody else, Dr. Pacenek go back to what you were saying and lay this
[2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:35.760]  out for folks because it's intriguing and tell me what I've added is wrong.
[2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:40.000]  Well nothing you've added is wrong, what's happening and this has happened since the
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:46.080]  beginning of 9-11 either on the left or right, it really doesn't matter in terms of politics,
[2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:51.040]  what's happening is it's literally what my people call the apocalypse of information,
[2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:56.360]  which means that fact can become fiction and fiction can be fact.
[2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:02.400]  Now why am I able to discern certain things in terms of reality and content and reality
[2:23:02.400 --> 2:23:08.000]  tests, it's not just because I'm a psychiatrist ironically, what makes me more capable of
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:12.840]  understanding a narrative and assuming whether it's right or wrong is that I have been a
[2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:18.680]  fiction writer for well over 30 to 40 years and in fiction which is what a lot of the
[2:23:18.680 --> 2:23:24.440]  FBI has been doing and a lot of what you have in Sandy Hook and Parker Land and all these
[2:23:24.440 --> 2:23:31.120]  false flag is that the narrative has an internal inconsistency that the narrators don't even
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:36.000]  understand because they're not writers, the good fiction writers who by the way happened
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:42.040]  to have been an intelligence like myself, whether it's Jean Le Carré or Somerset Maum
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:47.600]  or any one of the other Ian Fleming, we all understand that there are internal consistencies
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:52.480]  that must be there in order for the narrative to have a certain validity.
[2:23:52.480 --> 2:23:58.920]  Parkland didn't have that, the main character was this absurd fool, Israel, a Jewish sheriff,
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:04.320]  I mean you couldn't have had, this was like the movie with Mel Brooks, I mean it was an
[2:24:04.320 --> 2:24:10.160]  absurdity, this kind of character who's been investigated 10 or 12 times.
[2:24:10.160 --> 2:24:16.040]  In the same sense, when you looked at Sandy Hook, the absurd notion that an autistic kid
[2:24:16.040 --> 2:24:24.080]  could pick up a heavy weapon and then kill 25 or 30 kids plus six adults was beyond produlity
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:26.840]  either as a fiction writer.
[2:24:26.840 --> 2:24:32.760]  So much of what I had to write in my real world and what I did in regime change or neutralizing
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:38.880]  something or someone, I had to put back in fiction and in part you saw Jack, Ryan, Dick
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:44.840]  Clark under the Clancy franchise which was our way of explaining what really was happening
[2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:46.680]  in 20, 30 years.
[2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:52.400]  Now what's actually happening with the apocalypse of information and the onslaught of all this
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:59.680]  information, which my people and national geospatial agency and the CIA and elsewhere
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:04.920]  what they're studying and they're very much concerned about is that the onslaught of information
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:08.600]  is such that we have no basis for reality testing.
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:14.480]  The fiction writer can no longer assess whether the narrative is correct or not because the
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:20.440]  reality that's presented is so bizarre that even if I were to be a fiction writer my editors
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:27.000]  were very rational whether at Berkeley or whatever house they would say it's not credible
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:28.640]  so let's not use it.
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:33.640]  So what's happening to Alex Jones and why you're picking it up, you're the spearhead
[2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:38.600]  of a reality testing which in the beginning sounds absurd but it's not.
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:44.160]  What you said is the overload of information when it's coming on a constant basis has its
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:49.920]  own internal dynamics which is pretty close to chaos because we have now what we call
[2:25:49.920 --> 2:25:56.520]  again a generative alternative network which means Google systems or the brains in Google
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:04.160]  systems they can create an algorithm that has its own imagination and its own attributions
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:05.800]  and introspection.
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:11.880]  Now think of it, you have already algorithms that can think within itself.
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:18.040]  You have algorithms which Zach correctly pointed out can distort images either contract them
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:23.240]  or hyper extend them into the point where you don't even need the real body and many
[2:26:23.240 --> 2:26:29.120]  of those things were used in these false flags that have been going on in Florida and elsewhere
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:30.960]  all over the world.
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:32.880]  Now why are they doing that?
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:38.600]  Well the government whichever local area is involved whether it's Scott who's not the
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:45.800]  brightest governor we've had in Florida nor the morons in Parkland including this sheriff
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:50.920]  they don't realize that they're basically entering into a self-destructive trap.
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:57.520]  The minute they get into it they already politicized to such an extent that their credibility is
[2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:04.720]  gone whereas in your case it always sounded as if your credibility was on hold so to speak
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:10.040]  but it always turned out to be quite accurate and the reason for that is that you're not
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:16.160]  alone I can't explain to you how many there are that really oversee you as you once said
[2:27:16.160 --> 2:27:21.360]  to me twenty, nineteen, twenty years ago there are thousands of intelligence operatives
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:24.720]  watching this and that is correct today.
[2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:29.520]  There are thousands who are watching all over the world not because they're listening to
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:36.440]  what you're saying as more in terms of trying to monitor what is the dynamic of this onslaught
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:42.080]  of the apocalypse of information and we're not using yours bait but in a way you are
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:47.720]  kind of an artificial bait where we have a sense of the timing and the dynamic.
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:49.880]  Is it the deep, deep state of the lab?
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:54.960]  No I understand I mean just investigation and real debate scares the establishment it scares
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:59.960]  the different factions they then reveal themselves in the attack so we're used as like a gambit
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:04.920]  or a probe to draw them out and again it's not intelligence agencies people running me
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:08.440]  or that ever funded me or did it since we covered real issues we're the only shows to
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:13.120]  do it that then brought all those people in the guests the information and then built
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:17.280]  up the show and so that's what's special about Info Wars I'm just the guy crazy enough
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:20.480]  to be in the middle of it so again you're right it's not about me the magic of Info

[2:33:38.960 --> 2:33:44.200]  steve pacenic dot com just just briefly get into psychological warfare in the media the
[2:33:44.200 --> 2:33:50.560]  mainstream media this big globalist combine they now operate to ban people to attack people
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:55.360]  to run dirty tricks and they're getting worse and now they've gotten basically almost every
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:33:59.920]  level of the mainstream media to be deceptive where they'll put out a mainline from from
[2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:05.560]  seats singing in last week saying that i said no kids died and it was a false flag we were
[2:34:05.560 --> 2:34:08.760]  still investigating i did say there was a stand down which was confirmed we just talked
[2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:13.120]  to a bunch of students on local news wasn't hard that's what we keep getting confirmed
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:15.960]  was already all over the news and we got a bunch of teachers and kids saying the same
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:21.120]  thing that they all just sat out there for 10 minutes with a bunch of cars and i went
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:26.040]  with it and that's the videos they really banned so see it then comes out and says in
[2:34:26.040 --> 2:34:30.440]  three articles we're banning him we're talking to youtube we're in his account it'll be gone
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:35.280]  soon first strike we'll have second strike by this weekend he'll be gone that's now
[2:34:35.280 --> 2:34:41.360]  started then drudge picks it up again seven million plus views on the band videos people
[2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:45.840]  see that it was the opposite of what they said it was just eyewitnesses so then they
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:53.160]  get a second strike today they block the channel so you can't go to it can't upload then they
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:35:01.920]  remove the strike but don't even say that our our appeal happened don't tell you okay
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:06.840]  we accept your appeal no they just disappear it and now the washington post and everybody's
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:11.120]  calling up saying did you really get strikes no one ever struck you that was never even
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:17.760]  a cnn article no one's after you everything ever happened that's in the space of four
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:23.760]  days i mean about praying on your audience but i'm not a psychiatrist or psych warfare
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:28.080]  expert all i know is the average person gets cognitive dissidents and just kind of tunes
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:32.360]  out from the fog the apocalypse of information and that's what's so frustrating when you
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:37.240]  watch the anatomy of this and the different i haven't named the tactics i can just see
[2:35:37.240 --> 2:35:41.280]  them all and i like know the different ones like little little devils or something you
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:45.560]  know uh you know our bad smells you know and it's just like oh there's that one oh they're
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:50.560]  doing that and and then now i see them testing new tactics and what hurts me dr butchenek
[2:35:50.560 --> 2:35:55.800]  is to see such a mass of americans and then other global groups willing to be so evil
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:00.080]  willing to lie and then recruiting high schoolers to be part of it and here's the big breaking
[2:36:00.080 --> 2:36:06.760]  news david hog has backed down he says he will never debate an evil horrible person like
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:11.400]  me and we'll talk about that coming up after we finish getting into this because i i just
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:16.320]  had it in my stack and now i can't now i can't find it but they just oh it's on the screen
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:21.040]  i will not speak to anyone that has had disgusting remarks of victims of mass shootings in the
[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:25.960]  past i sent that tweet without realizing how awful so many people have been to the victims
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:29.920]  and witnesses of these events in the past and man you can see his tweets they sound
[2:36:29.920 --> 2:36:33.520]  like a you know like about like a 10 year old wrote and then then there's these tweets
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:38.080]  on his twitter that you know and i'm allowed to say do not sound like the same person there's
[2:36:38.080 --> 2:36:44.840]  multiple people on that twitter account or i'm a blue-budded baboon uh so uh they are
[2:36:44.840 --> 2:36:49.120]  in panic mode they thought they'd go on there and call me a piece of piece of crap and fat
[2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:53.280]  and ugly and a shyster and a sick old salesman and about 10 seconds into reading the tweets
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:56.560]  this morning i went he's baiting me to blow up but he was i haven't really bullied him
[2:36:56.560 --> 2:37:00.360]  yet and they want to so they're now they're panicking hey there's no videos of jones
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:06.680]  bullying anybody so we're gonna have to get him baited into it and now the fill mud is
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:11.560]  that you uh over there this just blew up in your dumb face so uh i'm not talking about
[2:37:11.560 --> 2:37:16.400]  david hog who's a wonderful sweet good young man who i think is being used here i'm talking
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:21.720]  about fill mud of the cia and of muller's uh behavior that uh one of muller's flesh
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:25.880]  tags uh that has been openly trying to run to these operations against us little birdies
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:30.280]  told me uh so dr patrick sorry i'm ranting please continue with the information apocalypse
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:37.680]  well you're not ranting what's happening is you are very much the victim or the point
[2:37:37.680 --> 2:37:43.160]  man for what's happening in the apocalypse information i mean when you look at cnn what
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:49.600]  do you have you have a feed individuals one who in particular uh work in the cia over
[2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:55.160]  the summer i mean anderson cooper he's not relevant he just isn't both blitz are working
[2:37:55.160 --> 2:38:02.640]  in israel and wilson i mean he's not relevant what's happening is in the world of attack
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:09.640]  in in uh propaganda you should really be proud of the fact that you are so worthy of such
[2:38:09.640 --> 2:38:15.560]  a mass of the tech it's like the onslaught of of russia saint petersburg and you're that
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:21.160]  poor russian who's defending against a huge onslaught of the nazi soldiers well what's
[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:27.640]  happening is the real rise of fascism comes in through the apocalypse of information so
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:34.400]  suppression repression gets through things like distortion denial and these are the technical
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:40.280]  terms for a way of saying we manipulate the news we manipulate the images we manipulate
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:46.760]  the story and the focal point we know is going to be the rebuttal by alex jones now why are
[2:38:46.760 --> 2:38:52.600]  you important to us to those of us who do defend the republic the reason is for whatever
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:59.000]  reason rightfully or wrongfully you have been there at the forefront and because of your
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:04.960]  skills and i'm not buttering you up but the ability to riff the way you can riff and tolerate
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:10.760]  the amount of onslaught that comes in is really quite remarkable it's almost like you're the
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:16.240]  soldier of the apocalypse of information there are very few stations that can tolerate this
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:23.240]  and very few who have become attuned to it remember this is taking over 17 years between
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:28.720]  you and me to build up something that you have built and now you have an extension and
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:34.120]  oh and shroyer you have another you know night i mean you've really built up an amazing
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:41.480]  thing without the support of the government without the support of quote individual foundations
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:47.600]  now it's up to the other institutions like the nr a if the nr a feels that they've been
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:55.800]  maligned then please i invite them to sue parkland to sue delta airlines to sue any credit card
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:03.720]  company they want nothing hurts at the system as much as a lawsuit and the fact that lawsuits
[2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:10.280]  can be initiated very quickly you don't have to be involved in that but the nr a has enough
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:14.320]  money oh they are saying they're not allowed to even have commerce they're saying the nr
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:18.800]  a these be blocked in banks they're saying kill members of the nr a and billboards i
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:24.080]  mean it's true racketeering the very classic sense of it and then the nr a who i love to
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:27.200]  death i don't want to say any of the nice things they've done behind the scenes because
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:31.240]  i don't i don't want to turn into a political firestorm forum but the nr a and their board
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:35.280]  members and people are patriots and more and more of them know exactly what's going on
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:40.960]  but they're too slow moving where ted newton will do 500 interviews by the time they create
[2:40:40.960 --> 2:40:45.960]  a new ad about who the nr a is that's running all over tv radio and the internet they should
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:51.840]  have a department where they dana los is great whoever daily is firing with bulletins with
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:56.200]  all that money they're spending i could triple the amount of money bringing into the nr a
[2:40:56.200 --> 2:40:59.440]  right now i don't even want them to hire me i could in fact i'm gonna meet with ted newton
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:03.560]  this weekend he already knows what to do but they don't even listen to him enough we need
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:08.280]  to absolutely get them on a war footing to fight back and not be in this you know this
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:12.840]  passive stance they need to get on the offense with the money and the platform they've got
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:15.920]  because they're trying to de-platform them everywhere they're trying to have their shows
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:20.840]  banned off hulu netflix twitter they're trying to you know soviet level silencing this all
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:26.000]  americans should rally behind the nr a now and and info wars and you and everybody this
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:33.080]  is a real war no i agree with you as i said this is an informational war this is an apocalypse
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:38.120]  of information it's very clear it's clear to my intelligence community it's clear to
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:44.720]  many patriots within the intelligence community the however we have to have a focal point
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:48.880]  we just can't scatter the shooting across no i agree then we need to get trump to move
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:53.040]  against google and these antitrust we'd have a new civil rights act for the internet you
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:57.440]  have to have access to it you can't be de-platform you can't have your id taken like china does
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:02.000]  you're made a ghost child we i mean this is the new electronic ghettos like drudge said
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:07.160]  what else do we do that i mean i agree let's codify a plan and we need to launch it with
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:12.560]  the activist well there has to be within the white house and this is what i've said from
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:19.000]  day one when keith alexander taken over the national security agency decades ago we need
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:25.680]  a cabinet position that is entitled cyber command cyber control we cannot have it just
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:30.400]  underneath the defense there we gotta go to break here's the issue we already have these
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:34.200]  corporations oh and i forgot guys bring me the apple articles that are out of roiders
[2:42:34.200 --> 2:42:39.280]  i will get your take on this apple basically moving to china and admittedly going under
[2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:44.200]  state control not just in china but worldwide i mean i i can't believe this is even allowed
[2:42:44.200 --> 2:42:47.720]  to done i mean at some high level i think oh they're really patriots and it's a way
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:52.200]  to infiltrate the chinese but they say the chinese are going to run their entire cloud
[2:42:52.200 --> 2:42:58.040]  system based in china with all the codes info wars wife is bringing you a breakthrough in
[2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:02.960]  modern medicine we have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:08.240]  distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:13.560]  respiratory health and normal breathing this is pollen block in the nineteen sixties researchers
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:18.760]  in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experience
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:24.240]  less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus
[2:43:24.240 --> 2:43:29.880]  production they began studying the effects in public trials in their public trials now

[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:36.720]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex jones now I know
[2:47:36.720 --> 2:47:41.120]  we've been working to get Dr. Jerome course he's articles today to the White House and
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:46.600]  I know some folks in the White House are reportedly tuned in about 15 minutes ago of course he's
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:52.280]  on with us now of course he got a second YouTube strike his channel is frozen the video talking
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:57.520]  about the president striking back politically against the globalist traders in 2018 was
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:03.800]  banned and this is an example then when they say it's banned they say for bullying children
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:08.640]  just like my videos said yes the parkland shooting happened yes they're not crisis actors they
[2:48:08.640 --> 2:48:13.600]  ban it and say I did say it that's now a big story on drugs report dot com right below
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:20.000]  the president trump I'm in for 2020 names campaign manager and that is again to prove
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:23.560]  who's with him in the political structure ahead of this and take control the narrative
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:28.880]  pure genius moves the democrats are already running against him the day he won alex jones
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:36.360]  on one strike away from YouTube band CNN admits they are working with Google to ban me and
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:41.120]  have seen employees going through everywhere trying to find something the video they banned
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:46.360]  today was of me saying that the shooting happened and they're not actors that they're not crisis
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:51.120]  actors they had to remove that strike though because they realized that we have our own
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:55.680]  servers and it posted it showing it in to say that so they are trying to de-platform
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:49:01.440]  all the supporters of the president it's a civil rights violation thousands of libertarian
[2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:05.920]  and conservative trump sites on Facebook Twitter and YouTube have been hit this is more than
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:11.160]  during the campaign we're deleted and the president needs to know that yes they want
[2:49:11.160 --> 2:49:15.160]  to get him off Twitter as they've said and if they can de-platform us they can de-platform
[2:49:15.160 --> 2:49:20.520]  the president because they're cutting off all of his internet army support and killing
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:24.640]  the first amendment at the same time now act asking Dr. Jerome Corsi to recap this and
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:28.320]  the Dr. Steve Pacinac who ran psychological operations at the state department work with
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:32.600]  the CIA I'm going to ask both these men their advice so we can get this to the president
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:36.920]  with the folks watching because I know they were tuned in 20 minutes ago and I wasn't
[2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:42.400]  reading my text the key intel of what's happening Dr. Corsi the globalist storm against our
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:46.760]  storm to restore the republic and what we should do as citizens but what the president
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:51.680]  should do to defend the first amendment and let not let the democrats ban his free speech
[2:49:51.680 --> 2:49:56.080]  in our free speech ahead of the 2018 2020 elections which the democrats have been this
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:50:03.160]  is all about Dr. Corsi well in one day today I got my second YouTube video removed so I'm
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:07.480]  not got two strikes since early this morning and that's never happened to you that's never
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:10.600]  happened to you never happened to me I've been on YouTube for years never happened to
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:17.600]  me but I started posting about QAnon and the two they removed one was about President Trump
[2:50:17.600 --> 2:50:23.680]  beginning a counter attack against the deep state and the second one was on the Florida
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:29.520]  shooting and again not saying it didn't happen not saying there were crisis actors just looking
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:34.960]  at why the police didn't respond as fast as they did and I basically removed all the content
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:41.400]  from my channel it just took it down and in fact I think that that's the beginning of
[2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:46.280]  the end because probably I had three strikes on me and they don't even know it I mean they
[2:50:46.280 --> 2:50:52.040]  just took the entire channel off YouTube they wouldn't get three you've taken you've made
[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:56.840]  it not public for now but they'll still even go in privately they've we have hidden cameras
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:51:00.400]  we have hidden cameras the president needs to know this of the New York Times project
[2:51:00.400 --> 2:51:05.560]  Veritas which he knows well as hidden cameras of them saying Trump supporters don't know
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:09.920]  with when they share American flags or Trump their shadow band and then all we do is send
[2:51:09.920 --> 2:51:13.840]  in bots that tell them they hate them and boy these old ladies get depressed and yeah
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:19.360]  our main jobs to stop Alex Jones the president needs to know it's that bad Mr. President
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:23.920]  it's that bad let's go to Dr. Steve Pachennick briefly we'll go into the next hour here Paul
[2:51:23.920 --> 2:51:28.560]  Watson's coming up he'll be in the middle of this as well but Dr. Corsi you be thinking
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:34.320]  for a moment then I'm gonna go to Pachennick for briefly what do we do politically as citizens
[2:51:34.320 --> 2:51:39.160]  what does the president do to have a focus to stop this because this is like something
[2:51:39.160 --> 2:51:45.200]  out of the Soviet Union first of all the president has to understand that we are behind in an
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:50.240]  artificial intelligence and cyber command that's why I've asked for a couple of years
[2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:55.840]  that we elevate people and bring in from the private arena Keith Alexander General Keith
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:52:03.040]  Alexander who's an expert on information warfare and the apocalypse of information and we have
[2:52:03.040 --> 2:52:09.040]  a whole unit at National Geospatial Agency which is NGA which should be paramount in
[2:52:09.040 --> 2:52:15.360]  the attack the counter attack to what's happening and quite frankly the other ones who are supporting
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:20.200]  you right now and they're the ones who are providing me the kind of backup that I need
[2:52:20.200 --> 2:52:27.200]  in order to remain on the air so we have institutions which will fight in the forefront but we have
[2:52:27.200 --> 2:52:32.880]  to be more aggressive more assertive quite frankly the president didn't allot enough
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:39.440]  money in for the artificial intelligence area or the cyber command unfortunately went into
[2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:44.520]  hard targets into four structures which we don't really need at this point in time and
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:49.480]  as General Mattis understands we're going away from the counterterrorism nonsense that
[2:52:49.480 --> 2:52:54.880]  we had under Bush Obama and Clinton and we're going back into strategic force structure
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:53:02.120]  opposing China and the so and Russia right now I think the NRA should initiate a class
[2:53:02.120 --> 2:53:08.840]  act action lawsuit they're capable of doing it they understand it very well and the American
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:11.680]  what should the White House do we'll talk next time about the NRA but what should the
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:17.280]  White House should bring a position where a key element a key individual like John Kelly
[2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:22.800]  the the equivalent of a John Kelly and I'm recommending General Keith Alexander who's
[2:53:22.800 --> 2:53:28.040]  worked with Kelly to be in charge of cyber command so they can basically stop all of
[2:53:28.040 --> 2:53:33.760]  this nonsense and put it a let's be clear telecoms and big big tech companies like Google
[2:53:33.760 --> 2:53:37.800]  Facebook and Twitter they're now in a cyber war against America and the president and
[2:53:37.800 --> 2:53:42.560]  the make America great Apple is moving to China to be state based at zero tax they're
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:49.400]  moving a few factories here but they're moving their main cloud global ID global social network
[2:53:49.400 --> 2:53:53.880]  system where it'll tie into the real world and spy on everybody and if you're not a
[2:53:53.880 --> 2:53:59.000]  good globalist you're banned from electronic activity basically a death sentence so I mean
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  what should the president do about that I mean this is just insane no let me explain
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:08.720]  something with all due respect Google has a very strong connection with the national
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:14.000]  geospatial agency they spend billions of dollars I know they do but they're going along with
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:19.240]  with the globalist saying to censor people well not not exactly they made the elements
[2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:23.640]  within it but not all of Google at the same time they've removed the strikes now you're
[2:54:23.640 --> 2:54:28.600]  saying it got reviewed higher up well most probably I can't tell you for certain but
[2:54:28.600 --> 2:54:34.480]  I can assure you that they are under the control of the national geospatial agency in the same
[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:41.960]  way the CIA has a major input into Amazon none of these institutions are free and clear
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:48.360]  you have to remember that there may be individuals who work within Google within Apple within
[2:54:48.360 --> 2:54:53.760]  Amazon who feel that they can go on their own and maybe rogues but I can assure you
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:58.600]  we can restrain them very quickly the issue of Apple going to China is not that they've
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:04.440]  had a cloud based system and the Apple's already in trouble for many reasons it didn't do it
[2:55:04.440 --> 2:55:10.560]  as well as it was supposed to do it had to have an audience or a consumer base that was
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:16.360]  as large as China the unfortunate part is President Xi quite frankly whom I've monitored
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:22.240]  for many many years is literally recapitulating what happened to him and his father he will
[2:55:22.240 --> 2:55:27.880]  end up in a cultural revolution and he will be destroying himself the same way the cultural
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:38.320]  revolution is becoming a dictator what does the president do antitrust actions draw attention
[2:55:38.320 --> 2:55:42.840]  to the violations of conservatives were being discriminated against like Jews in Nazi Germany
[2:55:42.840 --> 2:55:46.800]  literally were being economically cut off the NRAs being shut off they're saying kill
[2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:51.440]  us they're lying about us they're blocking us what does the president do well I think
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:56.160]  the president's first of all got to make it clear that this is a major attack on freedom
[2:55:56.160 --> 2:56:02.400]  of speech and that it's a denying a conservatives and libertarians the ability to express themselves
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:08.360]  on Google these arbitrary decisions secondly I think president the president Trump's also
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:14.760]  got to take into account this internet bill of rights which is being proposed and the
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:20.600]  new appointees to the federal trade commission just made it clear to the senate judiciary
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:25.960]  committee last week that they're happy to consider antitrust and other actions including
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:32.120]  actions which will restore freedom on the internet this I think you know Google's acting
[2:56:32.120 --> 2:56:41.600]  like a dictator like a big gorilla though the worst actor I think is Twitter or Apple
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:47.160]  I mean Apple won't even let conservatives have platforms or have apps now well I think
[2:56:47.160 --> 2:56:51.320]  there's an entire you know the the whole FTC is going to have to take into consideration
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:58.200]  whether the broadband rights are going to be allowed to companies that censor and act
[2:56:58.200 --> 2:57:02.200]  as if they're the right to maintain what content we get to see or we don't get to stay there
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:05.240]  I agree with you but I'm going to say this right now to the people everybody else listening
[2:57:05.240 --> 2:57:10.320]  the it's the right thing to do and they'll be incredibly popular the president goes
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:15.440]  Obama took over the internet calling it neutrality if he could he says I want real web freedom
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:19.600]  and if he says I defend free speech and choice on the web and comes out and moves against
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:26.480]  these trust it will make him a rock star that will unify even the left behind him the old
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:31.640]  left not this modern rain watch left will be back with Dr. Corsi and Dr. Steve Pacennik
[2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:35.880]  with closing comments straight ahead then Paul Watson from London England it's the defense

[2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:22.680]  well let me just say something Victor it's people like you that then find the whole operation
[2:58:22.680 --> 2:58:26.960]  because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small percentage of them
[2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:30.880]  by a lot of the products so thank you but when you mention the the silver bullet coil

[2:58:40.240 --> 2:58:47.920]  not a silver bullet but the closest thing you're gonna find to a silver bullet new from

[2:59:50.000 --> 3:00:10.800]  listening to the Alex Jones show defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[3:00:10.800 --> 3:00:16.120]  it's Alex Jones all right I was talking to Dr. Corsi and Dr. Pachett and I said come back
[3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:20.400]  in this little short segment the bottom line from both you and they both said the same thing
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:24.880]  showing how great the brains are and I totally agree so Dr. Corsi quantify what needs to happen
[3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:29.040]  right now to save the republic to save the reboot and not let authoritarian interest
[3:00:29.040 --> 3:00:33.200]  come in and take over the internet well I agree with you president Trump has got to speak
[3:00:33.200 --> 3:00:39.560]  out and he's got to say we have to have internet freedom we cannot let the censorship of conservatives
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:48.320]  and libertarians be done by Google and YouTube at will I mean this is a complete violation
[3:00:48.320 --> 3:00:53.040]  of free expression on the internet and it's going to have to go to the FTC of it but that's
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:58.040]  going to take time in the meantime by the midterm elections you know Google and YouTube
[3:00:58.040 --> 3:01:04.000]  systematically removing all conservative views from the internet that don't agree with theirs
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:08.520]  and that's just unacceptable this is Trump's most important battle I know he thinks his
[3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:12.560]  new campaign head that ran the IT stuff is like get it it wasn't it was the people of
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:17.520]  course he understood it we're not taking credit away it was Drudge right down to all of us
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:23.520]  exactly Dr. Pachett it's most important that he appoint an individual within the White
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:29.480]  House to the equivalent rank of John Kelly national security advisor a gentleman like
[3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:35.120]  general Keith Alexander who understands cyber command who conceptualize national geospatial
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:42.440]  agency to have him make sure that we have that free speech amidst Google Amazon and
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:50.080]  all the cloud determined companies at the same time he will monitor whatever negative
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:56.880]  impact it has on our freedom of speech and on our constitutional requirements only a
[3:01:56.880 --> 3:02:03.360]  man who's that sophisticated can really understand how to manipulate and take away the distortions
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:10.720]  denials and the total fact sectional basis of what's happening now and he will prevent
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:15.520]  what we call a cyber war so I need somebody like general Keith Alexander to come out of
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:20.640]  private practice come into the White House and take over cyber command and let's be clear
[3:02:20.640 --> 3:02:25.080]  we're not talking about nationalizing it the global and foreign companies have come in
[3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:30.360]  and the Chinese are already in control at war with our country we're saying the federal
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:35.440]  government DARPA created the internet to be free and open they've come in and taken it
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:39.960]  over we need a guardian to stand in the place and not allow that and report to Congress and
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:43.440]  report to the president and report to the American people and then have the political
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:48.360]  will just by reporting it it will stop all these agencies that's exactly correct I was
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:53.800]  trained by DARPA I developed the net for series because of that internet and then I worked
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:58.840]  with the gentleman Keith Alexander and we need somebody to guarantee that constitutional
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:03.840]  right within the White House and has that expertise I think Donald Trump will be very
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:08.840]  pleased I think John Kelly will be pleased I think all the individuals will be pleased
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:14.960]  and relieved that we can in fact take back our democracy and I know Trump smart smarter
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:19.000]  than most of us but the war is them taking the web over it's already happened we're already
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:25.680]  under massive attack we've got to do this Dr. Corsi well and this is a war is not going
[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:31.480]  to stop I mean there's a war the Google and Twitter and the other content giants feel that
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:37.840]  they can have full sway over the you know that this is what the rules the Soros funded
[3:03:37.840 --> 3:03:45.680]  rules and on the so-called you know internet a good quality is internet a standard was
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:50.680]  meant to be that the Giants could censor whatever they want but it was only the internet service
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:54.920]  providers on this net neutrality that were forced to be seen that's what's crazy you
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:59.720]  just said I forgot George Soros admittedly and these big foundations already run what
[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:04.200]  could be on the web instead of Congress and the White House just saying free speech I
[3:04:04.200 --> 3:04:08.280]  mean think about that we're not saying take over the web Trump we're saying defend it
[3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:14.240]  from George Soros and the globalist and let the internet be the same kind of free discourse
[3:04:14.240 --> 3:04:19.080]  that we have and under the First Amendment in general I mean you cannot have it be such
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:26.560]  that one group like this like Google or YouTube it decides that there's going to be no views
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:32.520]  except hard left well they said six months ago Soros's group advises them on what stays
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:37.760]  up and what stays down and then CNN is involved getting us banned gentlemen thank you very
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:42.800]  powerful we need to push this to the people solutions targeted actions you're on target
[3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:46.560]  listeners this is critical info if you want to win and defeat the New World Order we got
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:54.920]  to do this now we'll be back with Paul Watson from London

[3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:11.960]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:15.920]  remember jeff bezos owns the washington post is constantly calling for info wars to be
[3:06:15.920 --> 3:06:21.560]  shut down they call us selling high quality supplements snake oil when jeff bezos is the

[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:51.640]  up everything and then in the newspaper is the media saying oh youtube had to replace
[3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:54.840]  uh one of the strikes because it was totally made up we had a video saying there weren't
[3:10:54.840 --> 3:10:59.000]  crisis actors they called that crisis actor video so they they took one strike off but
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:02.920]  still they've got the site banned from streaming till they dig up something better because it
[3:11:02.920 --> 3:11:06.600]  wasn't playing their narrative and drudge linked to it again see they just want to do
[3:11:06.600 --> 3:11:11.960]  it when drudge doesn't link again and nobody they want to strangle us in the dark but things
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:17.120]  aren't going too well for them for with us but with you that the purges the channels
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:22.280]  coursey every guest i'm having on this prominent is having their channel shut down so paul this

[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:43.320]  spreads the links to that gets that out but how would you quantify what's going on right
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:49.840]  now i mean it is crazy well it's a purge alex i mean they've tried this before they've
[3:11:49.840 --> 3:11:54.520]  taken baby steps towards it now they're just going out full blown like we've got a platform
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:12:00.360]  that we can complain about it we can get linked on drudgereport.com we can get attention alex
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:04.920]  every numerous youtube channels over the past two weeks have been completely shut down some
[3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:09.360]  of them will be known to our viewers in fact there's an article about it on gateway pundit
[3:12:09.360 --> 3:12:15.560]  youtube purge begins top conservative youtube sites taken down in february sweep there's
[3:12:15.560 --> 3:12:20.720]  one called um bomber body language we've probably featured videos from that before where it's
[3:12:20.720 --> 3:12:27.240]  just like this mild mannered lady speaking about people's body language that got completely
[3:12:27.240 --> 3:12:33.760]  deleted she had 2600 they're doing strikes on on on call on on on on the college sites
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:41.160]  everybody 265 000 youtube subscribers she's gone david seamen he's been on the show before
[3:12:41.160 --> 3:12:46.720]  he's gone uh richie alan you've been on his show before he's gone collin flat he's been
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:52.360]  on your show before he's gone they're all gone this is a total hundreds of all the major
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:57.880]  gun sites are gone like their headers are still there but there's no videos and listen listen
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:03.120]  to what google's doing google shopping has not only removed search results for guns which
[3:13:03.120 --> 3:13:09.600]  they did by the way like six years ago but now they've removed search results for burgundy
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:14.240]  like if you try to buy a bottle of burgundy wine you can't do it on google shopping because
[3:13:14.240 --> 3:13:19.960]  it has the word gun in it if you want to buy a water pistol they've removed that it's just
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:24.440]  totally oh you can still buy arsenic and flamethrowers by the way because they don't have the word
[3:13:24.440 --> 3:13:29.280]  gun in them if you want to buy guns and roses album forget about it i mean this is just
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:34.920]  the absolutely imbecilic they're trying to do it to ban certain keywords and it's just
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:40.240]  blowing up in their faces making them look stupid for alex yeah hillary clinton complained
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:45.280]  about this last night she came out with a tweet saying basically social media cost her the
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:49.720]  election it didn't that what cost you the election is your inherently detestable and
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:55.280]  had a terrible campaign strategy that's why you lost but no it was facebook it was twitter
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:14:00.360]  we need to do more to censor to ban she openly got up on twitter last night and called for
[3:14:00.360 --> 3:14:06.920]  that so this this is the purge they know they're going to lose in 2018 and 2020 if they don't
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:13.360]  crack down imagine how viral we would be alex right now without the shadow banning without
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:19.600]  being demoted in the algorithm without constantly almost on a day-to-day basis now having to
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:24.080]  talk about this over and over again to a blue in the face so our own listeners get bored
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:28.240]  of it we're on the back for we can't get on the front for and get out our own narrative
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:33.800]  and that's part of the game that's why they go defend democracy ban free speech we just
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:40.160]  put her tweet up yeah she she said that we should all care about how social media platforms
[3:14:40.160 --> 3:14:44.920]  play a part in our democratic process because unless it's addressed it will happen again
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:49.080]  what will happen again you'll lose because you didn't go to whisk on sin yeah that will
[3:14:49.080 --> 3:14:53.920]  happen again the democrats will lose if they have a candidate with any actual platform
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:59.080]  and i love how mark dies control i love how mark dies responds down there let's read his
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:04.800]  tweet yeah i got a lot of good responses there was one from gab as well his top one is maybe
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:12.680]  you should pay more maybe you had to pay more because nobody wanted to see your stupid ads
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:17.280]  in their feeds yeah because they were claiming that hillary had to pay twice as much as trump
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:21.680]  or whatever which you know with facebook you have to lay down a lot of money for that to
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:26.680]  reach anyone so it is probably not she's probably not even writing pointing that out but again
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:30.320]  it's a purge alex that they're coming for the free speech this is it they're coming

[3:24:23.520 --> 3:24:28.520]  you it's just in I want to ask this question in closing and have you take over what is
[3:24:28.520 --> 3:24:34.040]  it like starting to work with info war 16 years ago 17 years ago whatever it was and
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:40.240]  now I ask this question every year or so to you to now how surreal is this because we
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:44.840]  just wanted to put out issues for other people that have debate to see everybody else rolling
[3:24:44.840 --> 3:24:49.440]  over like cowards of the system and to just see this epic battle but so many good people
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:53.680]  standing up who are grassroots what would you call this moment in time Dr. Pachennick
[3:24:53.680 --> 3:24:57.640]  was calling it the information apocalypse I mean it just gets crazier by the day where
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:04.840]  is this going well it's going towards them directly delisting info wars completely off
[3:25:04.840 --> 3:25:09.000]  of Google that's their ultimate aim like they'll probably get to the point where they tried
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:15.920]  to censor ISPs from allowing info wars to even be accessible to their users I mean this
[3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:21.760]  is how far they've lost the argument okay we've got the viral resonance with the population
[3:25:21.760 --> 3:25:25.640]  they know that so instead of getting better arguments and trying to combat us on a on
[3:25:25.640 --> 3:25:30.080]  a fell on a level playing field they're just trying to censor us I mean we didn't even
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:36.200]  talk about it Alex medium.com right Cernovich Jack Pasobic and others had all these big
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:42.960]  articles upon medium.com big national national security news stories they just wiped them
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:49.080]  off the platform last week bang your god even though it's literally like Cernovich has breaking
[3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:55.520]  national news stories with real sources over and over again and he was giving some of it
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:00.560]  like he gave one to Buzzfeed they checked it out it was a real story they published it
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:05.280]  but no so again I mean Drudge warned us all along not to get too dependent on sites that
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:10.080]  we don't control we've all done that because we needed to get out in the battlefield but
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:14.000]  now it's gets we've got blow well I mean Drudge was right but we worked to warn people to
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:18.920]  keep the you know the big globalist web somewhat free we're still fighting while trying to
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:23.600]  build other you know platforms so it's been an important balance but clearly we're now
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:27.280]  entering a phase where folks have got to go to news wars.com because they you know hacked
[3:26:27.280 --> 3:26:32.000]  and took that info wars yesterday for a couple hours to now go to prisonplanet.com understand
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:35.400]  I know let's just I know you get this we've got all this other news to hit that's important
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:42.920]  but this is the real deal and we're winning but now they want to shut us up exactly and
[3:26:42.920 --> 3:26:47.440]  I mean with YouTube as well Alex there's another issue with that you remember Logan Paul who
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:54.480]  filmed the suicide victim in Japan he's just been invited back and braced with open arms
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:27:01.400]  by YouTube saying oh we will let you back on monetization within 90 days like Alex I
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:08.200]  uploaded 18 video straight they were all demonetized you know why because I put info wars in the
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:14.040]  tag the first time I didn't put info wars in the tag yesterday boom it was monetized
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:20.120]  they're blocking the word info wars and that's probably how they're doing the algorithm demotion
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:25.600]  as well anything related to info wars gets jammed down there because we're resonating
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:31.680]  and instead of combating us on the field of play they have to artificially demo our content
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:37.160]  entirely and that's what it's all about especially heading towards 18 2018 at midterms this is
[3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:43.040]  only going to intensify James O'Keeffe sound sound at the warning bell those lawsuits in
[3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:47.520]  the offering and I mean this is the battle this is it they're going to try and strangle
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:52.000]  us entirely but as you said we just need to keep riding it basically until the wheels
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:59.440]  fall off at this point well I got to tell you it is simply insane that we're dealing
[3:27:59.440 --> 3:28:03.560]  with this go ahead and take over Paul a soy face which is a real thing and psychological
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:09.680]  studies of the of the soy boys that are victims of this cult and the bizarre faces they make
[3:28:09.680 --> 3:28:16.520]  I know they're trying to block that video right now it's just bizarre it's bizarre I
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:21.480]  mean half of these videos like based on memes Alex and they can't even tolerate memes it's
[3:28:21.480 --> 3:28:26.760]  like the establishment can't communicate in the language of memes so now they're trying
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:31.360]  to send some memes it's gone beyond the leftist don't know why they're guzzling soy and making
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:37.280]  these chimpanzee faces and then you cover it and then you're back I'm bad for covering
[3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:43.240]  it yeah completely Paul Joseph watch it go ahead we'll continue to do it until the wheels
[3:28:43.240 --> 3:28:46.600]  fall off Alex we're not going to do anything else we're not going anywhere we're not going
[3:28:46.600 --> 3:28:50.840]  away this is going to blow up on their face tries that style it already has great job

[3:33:33.960 --> 3:33:37.800]  watson i'm going to talk a little bit more about censorship but not too much because
[3:33:37.800 --> 3:33:42.840]  you're all probably bought to death by a bit by now and it relates to this headline upon
[3:33:42.840 --> 3:33:48.880]  bright bar dot com which is another level of imbecilic censorship google appears to
[3:33:48.880 --> 3:33:55.880]  remove all shopping search results for guns even water guns guns and roses and burgundy
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:34:03.520]  absolutely incredible now google removed search results at least in their shopping section
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:09.000]  for guns in twenty twelve from what i could see but now google has removed search results
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:14.600]  for any product that contains the word gone in it including water guns toy guns the band
[3:34:14.600 --> 3:34:19.680]  guns and roses and even burgundy from its shopping section google has removed the results in
[3:34:19.680 --> 3:34:24.360]  its shopping tool for a wide range of terms related to firearms unwittingly censoring
[3:34:24.360 --> 3:34:30.880]  completely unrelated items such as music groups and movies whose titles matched filtered terms
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:36.640]  so again this is the absolute crazy level of censorship where they will ban absolutely
[3:34:36.640 --> 3:34:43.000]  milk toast mild products simply because they have the word gun in them meanwhile allowing
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:47.760]  the sale of things like arse, nick and flame throwers that's literally what's documented
[3:34:47.760 --> 3:34:54.080]  in this article so if you search for gun guns pistol pistols ar-15 rifle and revolver in
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:59.480]  the shopping section of google search engine that will now fail to return any results while
[3:34:59.480 --> 3:35:04.200]  other searches which have nothing to do with firearms but include keywords similarly provide
[3:35:04.200 --> 3:35:10.040]  no results including toy guns water guns glue gun if you want to do any DIY this weekend
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:17.080]  forget about it guns and roses gondom top gun naked gun man with golden gun show gun sex
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:22.600]  pistols and even burgundy the fact that words including gun as part of the title have led
[3:35:22.600 --> 3:35:27.080]  many to suspect google is running a filter specifically to remove any search result including
[3:35:27.080 --> 3:35:33.240]  those letters as opposed to filtering by product category or vendor now there was a quite a
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:39.240]  funny tweet on this article which again documents the fact that you can still buy flame throwers
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:48.520]  arse nick but you can't buy guns and roses feed ease you can't buy water guns you can't
[3:35:48.520 --> 3:35:55.720]  buy burgundy wine absolutely incredible the level of moral panic the level of hysteria
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:36:00.760]  that's being generated in the aftermath of this school shooting is like nothing ever
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:05.880]  seen before now they're doing it on youtube with the conspiracy videos that's the big
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:10.920]  moral panic right now of course we have the Nazi moral panic with twitter and with youtube
[3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:16.920]  back last year which they used as an excuse to censor conservatives people like roger stone and
[3:36:16.920 --> 3:36:22.840]  others now they're doing it for google shopping results i mean when it gets to this level what
[3:36:22.840 --> 3:36:29.400]  do you think is going to happen right before the 2018 midterms what do you think the kind of online
[3:36:29.400 --> 3:36:35.000]  environment is going to be like in the run up to the 2020 election they're going to be banning
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:40.680]  absolutely everything they'll be outright delisting info wars from google.com that's what's coming
[3:36:40.680 --> 3:36:47.240]  next that's i'll put a bet on that they'll just blacklist the website entirely from google they've
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:53.000]  already done it from google news now you won't be able to google info wars whatsoever in maybe six
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:58.920]  months maybe two years but that's what's coming absolutely insane level of censorship now we
[3:36:58.920 --> 3:37:06.680]  have this headline out of the hill logan paul gets youtube advertising back in probation deal
[3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:14.520]  of course logan paul is the incredibly annoying viral youtube star who was infamously not even
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:19.000]  kicked off the platform i think he got one copyright strike after there was a big fury
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:25.480]  about it when he filmed a dead suicide victim in a japanese forest do you remember that story
[3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:30.440]  well now i'm battled youtube personality logan paul and by the way i don't even care i don't want
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:37.240]  him to be censored for filming a dead body yes it's distasteful yes it's offensive yes it's edgy
[3:37:37.240 --> 3:37:42.760]  but once they classify that then they move it on to everything else and by the way you can be edgy
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:49.640]  on youtube you can say the n word on youtube you can call people every name under the sun as long
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:56.120]  as you're not political they'll do nothing about it you won't even get demonetized in many cases
[3:37:56.120 --> 3:38:01.800]  there are people with like six seven million subscribers on youtube who relentlessly use the
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:09.080]  n word they do all kinds of stuff nothing happens to them fully monetized no strikes whatsoever
[3:38:09.080 --> 3:38:15.080]  when it gets political that's when they get nervous so polygon reported monday that paul
[3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:20.120]  will once again get advertising on his youtube videos but will remain on a 90-day probation
[3:38:20.120 --> 3:38:25.000]  that prevents his videos from appearing in the website's trending category which of course is
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:30.440]  not organically trending it's completely curated and artificial which will limit paul's ability to
[3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:35.320]  reach viewers no it won't he's probably got like 20 million subscribers doesn't even matter
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:39.720]  he will also be barred from getting google preferred ads on his videos ads that place with
[3:38:39.720 --> 3:38:46.600]  the top 5% of content on youtube and again literally the past 18 videos that i uploaded to youtube
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:51.000]  and by the way i don't make money off youtube advertising never did but it's just emphasizes
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:57.320]  how much they hate us the last 18 videos were completely demonetized without ever being reviewed
[3:38:57.320 --> 3:39:03.720]  as soon as they get uploaded demonetized not suitable for advertisers yesterday i uploaded
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:09.080]  one and for the first time it was monetized because i didn't use the tag info wars in the video
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:14.200]  and it was the only video out of 18 the last 18 that was monetized so that shows that they're
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:19.880]  using the tag info wars not only to demonetize but when a video is demonetized that also buries
[3:39:19.880 --> 3:39:26.120]  it in the algorithm and prevents it from going super viral but now logan paul has been embraced
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:32.840]  back into the youtube community with open arms with the ceo susan whose surname i'm not even
[3:39:32.840 --> 3:39:37.800]  going to attempt to pronounce has said that paul one of the platform's biggest stars does not
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:42.920]  deserve to be banned so he can go around filming dead bodies and laughing about it and like tasing
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:48.520]  dead rats and stuff he doesn't deserve to be banned and he gets all his advertising privileges back
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:51.720]  she said quote he hasn't done anything that would cause those three strikes
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:57.400]  he didn't question the narrative on gun control of course that's verboten on youtube now obviously
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:03.320]  she went on to say we can't just be pulling people off our platform unless they're conservatives then
[3:40:03.320 --> 3:40:09.320]  they can go screw themselves they need to violate a policy we need to have a consistent rules you
[3:40:09.320 --> 3:40:16.840]  don't have consistent rules there was a tim paul video where he was debunking some of the conspiracies
[3:40:16.840 --> 3:40:22.280]  about the parkland shooting remember the media conspiracy that they generated that they contrived
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:28.920]  that they endlessly reported that the shooter was a member of a white supremacist group completely
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:34.200]  fake news they did no checking into it whatsoever they just believed the troll on four chan when he
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:39.800]  told them and they ran with that news for over 24 hours they didn't even delete the original
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:46.520]  tweets it was like an ap tweet with what was it like 10 15 000 retweets didn't delete it tim paul
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:53.000]  makes a youtube video saying this is fake news the media circulating conspiracy theories about
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:41:01.400]  the parkland shooting his video gets removed from youtube even though he's decrying conspiracies
[3:41:01.400 --> 3:41:08.440]  about the parkland shooting so now you don't have consistent rules mrs youtube ceo it's one
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:14.440]  rule for them and another rule for everyone else every single time which is why everybody
[3:41:14.440 --> 3:41:21.160]  bitches about it endlessly on twitter and you don't listen absolutely incredible and if you
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:26.360]  want to buy burgundy wine on google shopping forget about it because it's banned what else
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:31.320]  is going to be banned when they're banning burgundy wine because their stupid algorithm their stupid
[3:41:31.320 --> 3:41:38.360]  filter doesn't even work properly youtube purge begins top conservative youtube sites taken down
[3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:46.280]  in february sweep mentioned this earlier bombards body language 265 000 youtube subscribers gone
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:56.120]  david seaman gone colin flattie gone richie allen gone again because they had edgy content and
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:42:01.960]  people were offended so what be offended who cares you're making the stride and effect come into
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:08.440]  effect by doing this anyway but again people say oh it's a private company now it's a monopoly
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:13.960]  if these are the only platforms which have any audience if these platforms are merging into one
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:20.040]  they're all buying each other until it's literally owned all owned by google when google is sky net
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:25.640]  and owns absolutely everything and becomes the de facto telephone it's like banning people
[3:42:26.520 --> 3:42:30.920]  from using a telephone because of the conversations they have with their friends i mean it gets to
[3:42:30.920 --> 3:42:36.840]  that point where everything becomes so concentrated such a monopoly that we need some kind of new
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:43.880]  regulation so my private company argument has long gone out of the window things need to change
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:48.360]  quickly because this is crushing the first amendment we'll be back on the alex joe show

[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:47.880]  here in about censorship let's move on to germany which had an election of course last year in the
[3:48:47.880 --> 3:48:53.800]  afd just became the second most popular party in germany the anti-immigrant party well now
[3:48:53.800 --> 3:49:00.680]  merkel finally acknowledges german no-go zones vows to eliminate those no-go zones at the left
[3:49:01.320 --> 3:49:07.320]  regaled as about not existing for the past three four years angela merkel has acknowledged their
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:13.720]  existence this is out of zero hedge following approval from germany's conservatives to cooperate
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:19.160]  with the social democrats by the way with a sec they were basically the uh equivalent of germany's
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:26.280]  democrats they've now been overtaken in popular support by afd which is absolutely huge german
[3:49:26.280 --> 3:49:31.240]  chancellor angela merkel sat down with germany's rcl where she discussed a number of policy positions
[3:49:31.240 --> 3:49:35.640]  including an acknowledgement of germany's growing no-go zones and the need to do something about
[3:49:35.640 --> 3:49:42.840]  them so all those people that lectured me about this being a conspiracy angela merkel herself
[3:49:42.840 --> 3:49:48.840]  admits it what have you got to say about that then she said quote talking about trying to
[3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:54.440]  reintegrate these people that means for example there are no-go areas there can be no rooms where
[3:49:54.440 --> 3:50:00.280]  no one dares to go and there are such spaces and you have to call that by name and you have to
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:05.560]  do something about it and i think that thomas the mazary who is i think the minister of the
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:10.920]  interior we also said now that we want a model police law we cannot stand by the different
[3:50:10.920 --> 3:50:15.400]  security centers in different states and that needs to be unified as soon as possible so
[3:50:15.400 --> 3:50:19.560]  she's openly admitting that they have these no-go areas which by the way is a more recent
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:25.720]  phenomenon in germany after their importation of about what was it over one million migrants
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:32.440]  now she's acknowledging it now she's acknowledging something needs to be done about it countering
[3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:38.120]  this idiotic conspiracy theory which still prevails among some on the left that these areas
[3:50:38.120 --> 3:50:44.920]  don't even exist talking about no-go areas sweden has a heck of a lot of them migrant
[3:50:44.920 --> 3:50:52.760]  ikea murderer explains away murder motive claiming sh it happens eritrain failed asylum seeker
[3:50:52.760 --> 3:50:57.800]  turned murderer abraham ukah badia claimed in an interview that he wants to forget his
[3:50:57.800 --> 3:51:05.720]  killing of a 55 year old woman and her 28 year old son in an ikea store in 2015 and said sh it
[3:51:05.720 --> 3:51:10.920]  happens these kind of things just i mean who hasn't walked into an ikea store on a weekend and be
[3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:17.160]  headed a couple of people i mean we've all done it right stuff happens that the 37 year old who
[3:51:17.160 --> 3:51:22.520]  was convicted of murdering a woman and her son opened up about his past in eritrea and brushed
[3:51:22.520 --> 3:51:29.560]  off the murder in a new interview with a swedish newspaper probably formed at his feet he claimed
[3:51:29.560 --> 3:51:33.480]  that if his application were rejected he would go to malta but noted he did not have the cash
[3:51:33.480 --> 3:51:37.480]  available at the time so he hasn't even been deported yet just behead a couple of people you
[3:51:37.480 --> 3:51:42.280]  know stuff happens this is sweden after all the islamic state of sweden when asked about the
[3:51:42.280 --> 3:51:47.560]  murder and how he thinks of it today the failed asylum seeker said sh it happens i understand
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:52.760]  that it's not a good thing but i want to forget it oh he wants to move on they're not even going
[3:51:52.760 --> 3:51:58.040]  to deport him he said he did not kill the pair in order to remain in sweden in prison saying it's
[3:51:58.040 --> 3:52:02.680]  not like that it was not good it's a misunderstanding i did not see the consequences just a little
[3:52:02.680 --> 3:52:10.600]  misunderstanding today i would not have done it it just happened what kind of sick attitude
[3:52:10.600 --> 3:52:16.840]  would you have to have to treat it with that level of you know inconsequentiality absolutely
[3:52:16.840 --> 3:52:23.400]  incredible speaking of sweden again 10 bullet holes found in swedish police station attacked
[3:52:23.400 --> 3:52:29.640]  overnight now in sweden it's so peaceful and tolerant and culturally enriched either the
[3:52:29.640 --> 3:52:36.360]  police stations have to have bullet proof glass be surrounded in steel or they just close them
[3:52:36.360 --> 3:52:42.520]  down entirely and put microphones in these no go areas that just pick up the screams of women and
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:48.920]  maybe maybe they'll get there in 30 minutes if they're not attacked with stones and rocks and
[3:52:48.920 --> 3:52:53.880]  bats or whatever maybe they'll get there maybe they won't now 10 bullet holes have been found in
[3:52:53.880 --> 3:52:58.360]  swedish police station attacked overnight they've had grenade attacks in malmo on these police
[3:52:58.360 --> 3:53:04.360]  stations it's total bedlam but you know it's a nice place to go apparently that's what i was told
[3:53:04.360 --> 3:53:09.800]  police in the swedish migrant majority town of soljolade butchering that pronunciation
[3:53:09.800 --> 3:53:13.800]  discovered 10 bullet holes in the local police station thoughts who have been attacked by an
[3:53:13.800 --> 3:53:18.360]  unknown assailant on early monday morning the shooting occurred at the town's police station
[3:53:18.360 --> 3:53:24.520]  located about a 30 minute drive from stockhome according to investigators a police spokesman said
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:29.160]  the holes were likely from bullets but i could not make a definitive comment until technicians
[3:53:29.160 --> 3:53:36.280]  had examined the scene so they're just firing bullets randomly at the police station you know
[3:53:36.280 --> 3:53:42.200]  sh it happens what you're gonna do about it in the troubled migrant population java area in stockhome
[3:53:42.200 --> 3:53:47.480]  the last remaining police station was forced to close its doors due to a lack of officers to
[3:53:47.480 --> 3:53:54.360]  staff the station i wonder why they were so reluctant to staff it it continues attacks
[3:53:54.360 --> 3:53:57.880]  on police in sweden have increased in recent months following the bombing of a police station in
[3:53:57.880 --> 3:54:03.240]  helsingborg in october which was described as an attack on democracy by the swedish prime minister
[3:54:03.240 --> 3:54:07.880]  are they going to do anything about it no just over a month later in november police officers
[3:54:07.880 --> 3:54:13.000]  in upsala were attacked by a man who threw hand grenades at a police vehicle hand grenades are
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:18.120]  attacked or a hand grenade attacks are up across sweden by the way that's part of their new cultural
[3:54:18.120 --> 3:54:24.120]  enrichment in january another police station in the heavily migrant populated city of malmo
[3:54:24.120 --> 3:54:28.920]  which left thinks is a paradise was bombed destroying much of the facade of the building
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:35.080]  and damaging several vehicles no officers were injured two men were arrested so sweden continues
[3:54:35.080 --> 3:54:39.800]  to enjoy its cultural enrichment sweden has an election coming up by the way in september
[3:54:40.360 --> 3:54:45.640]  where basically the only party that's promised to do anything about this the sweden democrats
[3:54:45.640 --> 3:54:53.240]  has a pretty good chance of winning so basically that is sweden's last hope we have the italian
[3:54:53.240 --> 3:54:58.600]  election coming up in march here just in a few days time actually i think is the fourth of march
[3:54:59.560 --> 3:55:04.760]  where it looks like a right-wing coalition a conservative coalition is going to win in italy
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:11.080]  part of that coalition has promised to deport 500 000 migrants because they're having similar
[3:55:11.080 --> 3:55:16.600]  problems especially in these port towns being completely overrun by migrants arriving from
[3:55:16.600 --> 3:55:22.600]  greece arriving from libya so the italians have had enough they see italy's emergency immigration
[3:55:22.600 --> 3:55:29.560]  could be a swing factor in election the italians have had enough abdasweeds had enough will they
[3:55:29.560 --> 3:55:35.880]  actually grow a spine a backbone and vote in a party that's going to address these crippling
[3:55:35.880 --> 3:55:40.680]  social problems that have been brought about as a result of mass migration it remains to be seen
[3:55:42.040 --> 3:55:46.920]  another article here labor appoints racist transgender activist as a qualities policy
[3:55:46.920 --> 3:55:53.640]  advisor now this is the transgender activist who got kicked out of an advertising campaign by lori
[3:55:53.640 --> 3:55:59.000]  al in september last year you may remember this because she said quote the white race is the most
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:05.080]  violent and oppressive force of nature on earth she's a racist she's an outright racist she was
[3:56:05.080 --> 3:56:12.440]  kicked out even of lori al for saying that and who's hired her to be an advisor on an lgbt plus
[3:56:12.440 --> 3:56:19.560]  advisory board it's the labor party munro bergdorf said this thursday she was thrilled to announce
[3:56:19.560 --> 3:56:24.600]  i've been asked to be part of an lgbt plus advisory board for the labor party below a smiling picture
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:32.600]  of her and labor leader jeremy corbin this is a party the labor party that allows segregated
[3:56:32.600 --> 3:56:38.120]  meetings at their own events because of course they're in mosques it's muslims so they allow
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:44.600]  segregation in that score and by the way they also refuse to allow or ask white people to pay more
[3:56:44.600 --> 3:56:50.520]  to get into their events openly breaking discrimination laws absolutely incredible
[3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:56.920]  now they've hired the woman or the transgender person g or whatever she wants to be called
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:57:01.720]  who said that white people were the most oppressive force of nature on earth she made
[3:57:01.720 --> 3:57:07.160]  explicitly racist comments but now she's been invited to appear on the bbc twitter she was
[3:57:07.160 --> 3:57:11.240]  verified by twitter they loved it of course that sort of stuff goes down well on twitter
[3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:16.680]  and now she's going to be on this panel for the labor party absolutely incredible the most extremist
[3:57:16.680 --> 3:57:21.960]  voices are being given the most prominent positions by the left they're getting more
