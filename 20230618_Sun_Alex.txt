[00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:35.508]  It's Sunday, June 18th, 2023.
[00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.670]  Father's Day.
[00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.331]  And I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.433]  Very honored and blessed to be here with you tonight.
[00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:48.026]  And I'm not a big fan of Hallmark holidays.
[00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:57.614]  They invented Father's Day, they invented Mother's Day, but... At the same time, it's a good thing they invented it.
[00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:00.296]  They were looking for new holidays to sell products on.
[00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:03.798]  Cards and things like that, but we should celebrate mothers and fathers.
[00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:08.522]  Especially when they are under such incredible attack.
[00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:09.623]  When I was thinking, I don't like
[00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:14.371]  Kind of Hollywood corporate holidays is what I meant to say.
[00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:36.267]  I guess that would be something like Halloween, which was not celebrated until the 50s in this country, and overshadows Christian and Catholic holidays of all Saints' Eve, and remembering those that have passed in your family lineage, similar to the Day of the Dead.
[00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:43.738]  Celebrated in Mexico is about remembering your ancestors and not celebrating ghouls and goblins.
[00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:45.819]  But people can do whatever they want.
[00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:53.742]  The point is that that's how they turn Christmas from Jesus into Santa Claus and then Easter into an Easter Bunny with candy eggs.
[00:01:53.742 --> 00:02:02.606]  They know exactly what they're doing, but in the case of Mother's Day and Father's Day, it's a good, healthy holiday, just like my favorite holiday is Thanksgiving.
[00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:05.407]  It's about family and getting together and being thankful to God.
[00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:09.512]  Not that I'm perfect, I just don't like these fake corporate holidays.
[00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:10.473]  But I kind of digress.
[00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:19.997]  What I really don't like is the puppet president that clearly stole the election, Joe Biden, who couldn't get 50 people to a rally and hid in the basement during the campaign.
[00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:26.820]  And now he's come out in the last few days and spoken against the Second Amendment.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.343]  And for those that are not gun owners or don't know basic stuff, a gun brace does not make a higher caliber go out the barrel.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.383]  You can only shoot the caliber in a gun that the barrel's made for, or it'll blow up on you.
[00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:47.329]  So it's just made up there, and everything else he says is a lie too, but here he is in his normal bumbling fashion.
[00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.093]  Because a federally licensed gun dealer is required by law to run background checks on those he's selling a weapon to.
[00:02:55.051 --> 00:03:06.297]  And in most cities down in Philadelphia and New York, there is, I know well, like up here, you'd see a truck pull up, pull to the curb, and selling weapons.
[00:03:06.297 --> 00:03:07.877]  Selling guns.
[00:03:07.877 --> 00:03:09.398]  Selling AR-15s.
[00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:11.739]  Selling weapons.
[00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.460]  Well, guess what?
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.222]  You do that now, you go to jail.
[00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:20.504]  Made it harder for people to buy stabilized braces.
[00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:22.805]  Put a pistol on a brace, it turns into a gun.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.332]  Make some more, you can have a higher caliber bullet coming out of that gun.
[00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.201]  Completely out of his mind.
[00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:40.626]  Of course, the only time we've seen trucks pull up and hand guns out is Fast and Furious, and Eric Holder in the Obama Justice Department, that got confirmed.
[00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:47.051]  So, I guess there are trucks pulling up and handing out guns in Mexico from the ATF so they can get traced back to the U.S.
[00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.452]  so they can blame the Second Amendment.
[00:03:48.452 --> 00:03:51.074]  But not to be outdone, here he is with Fetterman.
[00:03:51.074 --> 00:03:54.597]  Fetterman, introducing him, and then Fetterman, well again, just hear it for yourself.
[00:03:55.902 --> 00:04:01.226]  And now I'm standing next to the president again, next to a collapsed bridge here.
[00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:12.753]  And he is here to commit to work with the governor and the delegation to make sure that we get this fixed quick, fast, as well, too.
[00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:16.316]  This is a president that is committed to infrastructure.
[00:04:16.316 --> 00:04:24.261]  And then on top of that, the jewel, kind of a law of the infraction,
[00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:26.341]  I don't
[00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:42.359]  Uh, $9.95, and if you wanted...
[00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:09.017]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:13.940]  For a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you get them individually.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.582]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.042]  Two separate formulas.
[00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.624]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:26.867]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown.
[00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:32.450]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.910]  And I love it.
[00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.371]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:38.353]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[00:05:38.353 --> 00:05:41.755]  Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and boom!
[00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:43.095]  I think so.
[00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:14.904]  It's Sunday, June 18th, 2023.
[00:06:14.904 --> 00:06:15.864]  Wow!
[00:06:15.864 --> 00:06:23.945]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:32.107]  It's Father's Day!
[00:06:32.107 --> 00:06:37.168]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.689]  Boy, that's an important holiday.
[00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:48.210]  It's a modern holiday invented by Madison Avenue as a way to sell people gift cards for Hallmark, but I like it.
[00:06:48.210 --> 00:07:03.793]  It's a lot better than all the anti-human globalist holidays that are forced on us now, with these leftist bullies trying to invade every facet of our lives and make us join their dehumanized depopulation cult.
[00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:09.810]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.090]  I'll be here for the next two hours.
[00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.192]  Then the great Owen Schroer is coming in for Sunday Night Live.
[00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:18.455]  It's always an amazing transmission as well.
[00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:21.597]  Okay, I've got to play this.
[00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:24.698]  It's getting so insane that I don't know what to even say at this point.
[00:07:24.698 --> 00:07:30.602]  But every time Biden talks, he sounds like he's a gibbering, lobotomized gerbil.
[00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:46.373]  And then Fetterman, who they have to keep months in the hospital every time before they roll him out for just a day or two, is up there basically in a bathrobe or in a jumpsuit and is even more brain damaged than Biden.
[00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:56.175]  And this is just emblematic of the establishment wanting to put completely brain-damaged puppets in who will follow any orders they're given.
[00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:58.016]  People think, oh, this is just a mistake.
[00:07:58.016 --> 00:08:01.758]  No, they had Herman Von Ruppe as the head of the EU for 10 years.
[00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:05.520]  Didn't know his name, could hardly walk, completely drunk by noon every day.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.502]  I mean, he ran the EU for over 10 years.
[00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:10.623]  And the last few years, he couldn't even talk.
[00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:11.924]  They'd have to hold him up at events.
[00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.780]  They'd have world leaders next to him, holding him up at the podium.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.462]  He'd be like, oh, women!
[00:08:18.462 --> 00:08:19.522]  I like women!
[00:08:19.522 --> 00:08:33.773]  So, the globalists have done this to put these puppets in, so they get all the blame, while the actual controllers are in the background, de-industrializing society, consolidating control, building a breakaway civilization we're talking a lot about here tonight.
[00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:42.545]  But here's a clip of Biden saying that a gun brace makes a gun a higher caliber and makes it shoot a bigger bullet.
[00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:49.911]  If you believe that, you believe the moon is made of cheese, and again, that the Easter Bunny is a real thing and so is the Tooth Fairy.
[00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:57.557]  And then we'll just segue right into Fetterman, two days ago, introducing Biden at the bridge collapse.
[00:08:57.557 --> 00:09:01.840]  Made it harder for people to buy stabilized braces.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.142]  Put a pistol on a brace, it turns into a gun.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.007]  Make some more, you can have a higher caliber weapon, a higher caliber bullet coming out of that gun.
[00:09:09.744 --> 00:09:15.068]  And now, I'm standing next to the president again, next to a collapsed bridge here.
[00:09:15.068 --> 00:09:26.598]  And he is here to commit to work with the governor and the delegation to make sure that we get this fixed quick, fast, as well, too.
[00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:38.447]  This is a president that is committed to infrastructure, and then on top of that, the jewel kind of a law of the infrastructure,
[00:09:40.237 --> 00:09:46.302]  Bill, that is going to make sure that there's going to be bridges all across like this, all across America getting rebuilt.
[00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:48.003]  By the way, the full speech is up there.
[00:09:48.003 --> 00:09:48.944]  It was like a 10-minute event.
[00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:51.246]  They're both gibbering morons the entire time.
[00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:59.752]  But who's not a gibbering moron is the mighty media analyst Mark Dice, who really broke down the incredible developments the last few days with the Dodgers.
[00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:00.553]  So here's that report.
[00:10:00.553 --> 00:10:01.614]  We'll go to break and be right back.
[00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:15.542]  Last night, thousands of protesters gathered outside of Dodger Stadium to protest the team re-inviting the nun-themed drag queen group, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, after they were initially invited.
[00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:21.004]  Then there was some backlash, and then the invitation was rescinded, and then the L.A.
[00:10:21.004 --> 00:10:21.364]  Dodgers
[00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:34.170]  He apologized for the terrible homophobia, drag queen phobia, of not allowing a blasphemous group of Satanists to come and be celebrated and given an award.
[00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:44.415]  And so, to the Catholics and Christians' credit up there in Los Angeles, thousands of them descended upon the stadium to make their voices heard.
[00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:50.718]  It even stunned the local news, KTLA, who couldn't believe that Christians are finally getting some guts!
[00:10:51.078 --> 00:10:54.541]  We've seen this grow since 3 o'clock, but my goodness.
[00:10:54.541 --> 00:11:01.067]  Yeah, the protests are in response to one of tonight's honorees, the group known as the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.
[00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:05.731]  Rachel, we saw you an hour ago, and the crowd has grown exponentially.
[00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:11.977]  They say that the Sisters, they feel as though the Sisters are mocking Catholicism and its leaders.
[00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:14.519]  If you take a look here behind us, you can see some of the protests.
[00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:17.382]  They are in a parking lot right outside of the stadium.
[00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:18.202]  Look at that!
[00:11:34.867 --> 00:11:35.828]  Well, it's about time.
[00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:37.790]  In fact, it's long overdue.
[00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:54.705]  And in attempts to try to appease both the LGBT mafia and the Catholic community and the protesters, the Dodgers decided not to award the satanic drag queen nun group their award during the game, and instead did it hours earlier
[00:11:55.385 --> 00:12:00.728]  When, as you can see, there was basically nobody there.
[00:12:00.728 --> 00:12:03.210]  This video was shot by the great Savannah Hernandez.
[00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:08.272]  She's that feisty little Latina who works for Turning Point USA, who used to work for InfoWars.
[00:12:08.272 --> 00:12:15.877]  But a lot of people are getting the wrong impression, thinking that this was the actual game and that everybody boycotted it and nobody showed up, but that's not the case.
[00:12:16.457 --> 00:12:28.226]  But they did, like I said, give him the award hours earlier because if they would have done this during the actual game, these drag clowns would have been booed off the field.
[00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:39.454]  This is a shot she took during the actual game, so I don't know what the usual attendance is there in Dodger Stadium, but looks a little bit sparse to me.
[00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:41.716]  Of course, the LA Dodgers and, well,
[00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:55.547]  Literally nobody on planet Earth would invite a group of drag queens to come and perform dressed up as the Prophet Muhammad because that would be Islamophobic and they wouldn't want to offend the Muslims.
[00:12:55.547 --> 00:13:00.271]  And they also know that it would literally turn into a terrible tragedy.
[00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:14.017]  Just like the Draw Muhammad contest back in 2015 when some idiots in Texas had a Draw Muhammad contest and then two gunmen, Muslim gunmen, showed up and opened fire.
[00:13:14.017 --> 00:13:23.041]  And everybody knows that if any organization, let alone a major sports team, were to invite some drag queens who dressed up as Jewish rabbis,
[00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:34.446]  Then the ADL would have that shut down immediately, and whoever organized it would be fired, and the team would be literally begging for forgiveness.
[00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:40.149]  But most Christian churches in America, and Christians in general over the last decade, have become complete cowards.
[00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:54.213]  Afraid of being called homophobes for simply saying that people's sexual behaviors belong in the bedroom, not in a sports stadium, and definitely not in schools or classrooms.
[00:13:54.213 --> 00:13:59.015]  But the Christians who God would not spit out of his mouth for being lukewarm are finally having an effect!
[00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:15.568]  Major League Baseball actually told the players not to wear any LGBT rainbows on their jerseys during Pride nights because, well, they know now that there's going to be a massive backlash against those players.
[00:14:15.568 --> 00:14:18.831]  These kids at a Catholic school in Canada have finally had enough.
[00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:27.000]  But messages like this were quickly drowned out by the noise of a rowdy crowd.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.966]  Students tearing through pride posters and dancing on pride flags.
[00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:35.571]  It's rude and they're throwing water everywhere, they're looking at us, they're judging us.
[00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:36.953]  It shouldn't be like that, you're out!
[00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:45.576]  Rambunctious teens then turned violent, throwing pride bracelets and other random objects on the road and at people.
[00:14:45.576 --> 00:14:50.758]  Some kid threw something at my head and then in response to that everyone started cheering.
[00:14:50.758 --> 00:14:53.219]  There was like a group of guys.
[00:14:54.939 --> 00:14:57.463]  They were more like harassing us than supporting us?
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:28.147]  Also on Thursday in Las Vegas, the US-Mexico men's soccer match was cancelled in the middle of the game because the Mexican fans kept chanting certain words that hurt the LGBTQ people's feelings at the American players.
[00:15:28.147 --> 00:15:32.788]  So obviously they're not fans of Pride Night either.
[00:15:32.788 --> 00:15:36.710]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden doesn't know what the heck is going on anywhere.
[00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:42.695]  This is how he wrapped up his speech on Friday talking about gun control.
[00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:45.758]  Alright, God save the Queen, man.
[00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:54.287]  He doesn't even know which way to go.
[00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.548]  Yes, this way, sir.
[00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:57.730]  I'm praying that God save Donald Trump.
[00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:03.888]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[00:16:03.888 --> 00:16:05.990]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.912]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:16:07.912 --> 00:16:10.374]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:16:10.374 --> 00:16:11.195]  Hey, what's better?
[00:16:11.195 --> 00:16:12.056]  Knockout?
[00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:13.397]  What's better?
[00:16:13.397 --> 00:16:14.138]  Down-and-out?
[00:16:14.138 --> 00:16:14.658]  What's better?
[00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:16.940]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.865]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:16:22.552 --> 00:16:26.516]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:16:26.516 --> 00:16:27.858]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:16:27.858 --> 00:16:29.159]  They're all very diverse.
[00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:39.350]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller, that's been sold for many years, that people love, and sold for a lower price, under the name, Infowars MD, Good Night's Sleep.

[00:16:59.076 --> 00:17:04.780]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.462]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:10.083]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:10.824]  Period.
[00:17:10.824 --> 00:17:11.924]  Case closed.
[00:17:11.924 --> 00:17:13.285]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:17:13.285 --> 00:17:13.766]  We sell.
[00:17:14.286 --> 00:17:21.573]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:29.140]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[00:17:29.941 --> 00:17:34.323]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:17:34.323 --> 00:17:35.864]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:17:35.864 --> 00:17:38.666]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:43.888]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:49.351]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:51.012]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:17:51.012 --> 00:17:52.593]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:54.134]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:17:54.134 --> 00:17:56.695]  The point is, you can get the filters at mfoolworkstore.com.
[00:17:56.695 --> 00:17:57.915]  They're discounted right now.
[00:17:57.915 --> 00:17:58.636]  Finally back in stock.
[00:18:00.171 --> 00:18:03.312]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:18:03.312 --> 00:18:05.613]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:18:05.613 --> 00:18:09.535]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:18.478]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:18:18.478 --> 00:18:26.261]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:30.900]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.723]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:18:36.723 --> 00:18:39.744]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:46.806]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:18:46.806 --> 00:18:47.987]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:18:48.707 --> 00:18:52.988]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[00:18:52.988 --> 00:18:57.930]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.290]  Please take action now.
[00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:05.452]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:15.201]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:19:15.201 --> 00:19:18.044]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:19:18.044 --> 00:19:21.368]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:29.336]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:34.680]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:46.208]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:52.272]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:19:52.272 --> 00:19:58.437]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:20:01.457 --> 00:20:06.058]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.058 --> 00:20:13.220]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.341]  And we are back on this Father's Day Sunday live transmission.
[00:20:18.341 --> 00:20:19.741]  Mark Dice is a hard guy to get on.
[00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:23.242]  He just says, look, love the show, Alex, but why don't you just air my report sometimes?
[00:20:23.242 --> 00:20:24.903]  And I'm like, well, absolutely.
[00:20:24.903 --> 00:20:28.383]  I mean, he's the best when it comes to breaking down what's happening.
[00:20:28.383 --> 00:20:30.864]  So to bookend it with what he just covered,
[00:20:31.693 --> 00:20:34.055]  with the situation with the Dodgers.
[00:20:34.055 --> 00:20:38.497]  Here's just a snapshot of the revolt in schools in Canada and the U.S.
[00:20:38.497 --> 00:20:41.599]  against the sexualization and brainwashing of the children.
[00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:49.824]  Then we'll come back after this segment and get into so much more, dealing with the poison shots on our children, RFK, Joe Rogan, and a lot more.
[00:20:49.824 --> 00:20:50.545]  But here's Mark Dice.
[00:20:50.973 --> 00:21:09.219]  It turns out that we're not the only ones sick and tired of the systemic anti-whiteism in America, and a certain group of people always sticking their private business in everyone's face every chance they get during the month of June, their fetish pride month, because kids now across the country are starting to revolt in high schools and middle schools.
[00:21:09.219 --> 00:21:13.440]  Which also means the liberal media is extremely upset about this mass awakening.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.621]  Here's MSNBC yesterday.
[00:21:15.621 --> 00:21:16.821]  This is Jamal.
[00:21:16.821 --> 00:21:18.782]  Jamal is a boy who lives in a poor neighborhood.
[00:21:19.142 --> 00:21:22.130]  He has a friend named Kevin, who lives in a wealthy neighborhood.
[00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.360]  All of Jamal's neighbors are African American, and all of Kevin's neighbors are white.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:38.846]  That video about systemic racism was part of an assignment that a high school teacher in South Carolina named Mary Wood that she gave to her AP Language class back in February.
[00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:52.113]  The video was supposed to prepare students for a writing assignment based on Ta-Nehisi Coates' book Between the World and Me, an award-winning, best-selling memoir that details America's complicated racial past and its present.
[00:21:52.113 --> 00:21:54.615]  But Mary Wood's students never got to finish reading that book.
[00:21:55.743 --> 00:22:04.169]  Her school's administration stepped in and ordered her to stop teaching it in class after complaints from two students about the video you just saw.
[00:22:04.169 --> 00:22:12.294]  Actually, lady, you only played a 15-second clip of a four-minute video, which, as usual, blames white people for all of black people's problems.
[00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:18.878]  And it sounds like the kids are tired of the systemic anti-white-ism, and so they finally stood up and said something about it.
[00:22:18.878 --> 00:22:20.179]  But please, cry more.
[00:22:20.427 --> 00:22:35.836]  Last year, South Carolina state lawmakers passed a rule in the state budget that makes it illegal to use state money to teach any ideas related to race, including that an individual, by virtue of his race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive.
[00:22:36.676 --> 00:22:45.200]  And ideas that cause an individual to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:55.525]  In other words, they banned critical race theory, which is really a deceptive term that most conservatives still use when they really are talking about and should be using the term anti-whiteism.
[00:22:55.825 --> 00:23:11.908]  But to help everybody transition to the proper terminology, I would define critical race theory as a scholarly-sounding cultural Marxist term used to disguise anti-whiteism, which promotes the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is woven into the fabric of America.
[00:23:12.108 --> 00:23:18.492]  Oh, there's plenty more to come in this video, so stay tuned, but real quick, subscribe to my channel if you're new here, because you're not going to get information and analysis like this anywhere else.
[00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:44.808]  If that language sounds familiar, it is because it's almost an exact replica of language in Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' Stop WOKE Act.
[00:23:44.808 --> 00:23:45.448]  Good.
[00:23:45.448 --> 00:23:52.914]  And thanks to the emails those two students sent to a member of their school board, we know just how uncomfortable these students were.
[00:23:52.914 --> 00:23:58.299]  One email reads in part, hearing the teacher's opinion and watching these videos made me feel uncomfortable.
[00:23:58.299 --> 00:24:00.501]  I actually felt ashamed to be Caucasian.
[00:24:01.141 --> 00:24:06.782]  I understand an AP language where we are learning to develop an argument and have evidence to support it.
[00:24:06.782 --> 00:24:09.503]  Yet this topic is too heavy to discuss.
[00:24:09.503 --> 00:24:18.205]  Well, kid, I'm glad you sent that email to the school board member, and it's great that it resulted in the assignment getting pulled, but next time you have to come from a place of strength.
[00:24:18.205 --> 00:24:19.966]  It's not that it's too heavy to discuss.
[00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:25.709]  Use linguistic judo and use their terminology against them and say, this is anti-whiteism.
[00:24:25.709 --> 00:24:31.794]  This is prejudice against white people or hostility toward, hatred of, stemming from envy or bigotry.
[00:24:31.794 --> 00:24:33.014]  And it needs to stop.
[00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:39.879]  The students sent their complaints not to the teacher, but to a sympathetic school board member who was instrumental in escalating the matter.
[00:24:39.879 --> 00:24:48.184]  That board member, Elizabeth Bernhardt, ran for and won her seat with an endorsement from the Lexington County chapter of Moms for Liberty.
[00:24:49.165 --> 00:24:58.027]  And Moms for Liberty is a fantastic organization which has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:24:58.027 --> 00:24:59.307]  So you know they're cool.
[00:24:59.307 --> 00:25:09.569]  Also this week at a high school in Huntington Beach, California, a math teacher tried to force the students to watch this LGBTQ fetish propaganda video.
[00:25:09.569 --> 00:25:15.550]  And so the kids started booing and asking the teacher why they're trying to groom the kids.
[00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:24.955]  Threatening them with a Saturday detention if they didn't participate in her sexual fantasies.
[00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:44.624]  And at a middle school, I think in Boston, kids did the right thing and the school was freaking out so bad that it made the local news.
[00:25:44.624 --> 00:25:49.606]  Parents angry at town hall over intolerance at Marshall Simons Middle School.
[00:25:49.606 --> 00:25:53.608]  Kids were asked to wear rainbow clothes in honor of Pride Spirit Day.
[00:25:53.608 --> 00:25:58.190]  But some organized a counter protest wearing red, white, and blue or black.
[00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:59.811]  It was an unruly disruption, in fact.
[00:26:13.547 --> 00:26:28.401]  These kids remind me of me when I was in middle school in the late 80s and early 90s if a teacher put up a fetish flag in the classroom we'd have torn it down immediately when they're out in the hall in between classes and nobody would have narked and if they put one up again it would have gotten torn down again.
[00:26:29.382 --> 00:26:31.663]  And we would have poured glue in their desk drawers.
[00:26:31.663 --> 00:26:36.385]  We would have filled their desk full of notes with things they're not allowed to say on social media.
[00:26:36.385 --> 00:26:39.466]  We wouldn't have even needed the parents to get involved.
[00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:42.607]  We would have drove them out of town ourselves.
[00:26:42.607 --> 00:26:44.068]  So bravo kids!
[00:26:44.068 --> 00:26:48.450]  And this is exactly why we need to take over the school boards across the country.
[00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:54.072]  Because this is a school board in Oregon and this is what they did two years ago.
[00:26:54.272 --> 00:27:05.525]  The BLM and LGBTQ ideology and curricula are shattering the innocence of children, promoting racial, defined, and negatively impacting the lives of our kids forever.
[00:27:06.081 --> 00:27:10.525]  School Board Director and Vice Chair Brian Shannon shares that sentiment.
[00:27:10.525 --> 00:27:24.218]  In fact, he went so far as to ask his fellow board members to not only ban Black Lives Matter and Pride flags and signs from district buildings, but also ban teachers from wearing BLM and Pride clothing while at work.
[00:27:24.218 --> 00:27:31.185]  The main goal of this is to get political symbols and divisive symbols out of our schools
[00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:39.064]  So we can focus on the already difficult task of educating our students in the core subjects.
[00:27:39.064 --> 00:27:42.766]  In the end, the board voted 4-3 in favor of a ban.
[00:27:42.766 --> 00:27:46.887]  See what can happen when normal people take over the school board, and it almost didn't happen.
[00:27:46.887 --> 00:27:50.349]  That was a close vote, so be sure to get on one.
[00:27:50.349 --> 00:27:53.250]  And while most Christians in America are cowards,
[00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.811]  You aren't even really Christians.
[00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:56.553]  They're just cultural Christians.
[00:27:56.553 --> 00:28:02.858]  They've never even read the Bible or the Gospels, the first four books of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:28:02.858 --> 00:28:10.384]  Muslims, on the other hand, have guts, and they don't care if people call them mean names like homophobes.
[00:28:10.724 --> 00:28:24.536]  And so, an all-Muslim city council in a city in Michigan, which they obviously took over, they just voted to ban all LGBTQ fetish flags from government property.
[00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:33.603]  This is how the Muslim children in Canada are being taught to properly respond to the queer cultural insurrection up in their country.
[00:28:33.783 --> 00:28:35.905]  And this is what a godless country we've become.
[00:28:35.905 --> 00:28:46.793]  This is a clip from Jeopardy whose contestants are touted as the most intelligent people in the country who can spout countless useless facts but don't know this.
[00:28:46.793 --> 00:28:55.460]  Matthew 6 9 says, Our Father which art in heaven, this be thy name.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.761]  Hallowed be thy name.
[00:28:56.761 --> 00:28:58.963]  Yes, also known as the Lord's Prayer.

[00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:11.614]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpastes designed by my father, a dentist, at MFullerStore.com that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils, and more.
[00:32:11.614 --> 00:32:12.636]  We have a turmeric toothpaste,
[00:32:13.547 --> 00:32:26.155]  We have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Pearl Calcium Toothpaste, and we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[00:32:26.155 --> 00:32:28.256]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[00:32:28.256 --> 00:32:29.577]  They're very, very strong.
[00:32:29.577 --> 00:32:31.678]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[00:32:31.678 --> 00:32:32.739]  Ours don't.
[00:32:32.739 --> 00:32:34.180]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.781]  It is just chock-full.
[00:32:36.201 --> 00:32:37.462]  We're good to go.
[00:33:01.317 --> 00:33:16.904]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.904 --> 00:33:25.568]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:27.225 --> 00:33:38.308]  All right, so there's a biological, chemical, electromagnetic, radiological attack on our cells, on our population, on our fertility, taking place on record right now.
[00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:45.130]  And someone that's been exposing the vaccines almost as long as I have is Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:50.471]  And he is the frontrunner now in major polls against the puppet Biden.
[00:33:50.471 --> 00:33:52.652]  They are in complete, absolute panic mode.
[00:33:53.682 --> 00:33:55.505]  Uh, right now in the establishment.
[00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:58.269]  Obviously, the big Joe Rogan interview, we covered it Friday.
[00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:59.911]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:33:59.911 --> 00:34:00.432]  It's amazing.
[00:34:00.432 --> 00:34:01.653]  But here's what he breaks down.
[00:34:01.653 --> 00:34:02.835]  And these numbers are very conservative.
[00:34:02.835 --> 00:34:04.558]  It's actually worse than this.
[00:34:04.558 --> 00:34:07.622]  Uh, in other countries like South Korea with even higher vaccine rates.
[00:34:07.622 --> 00:34:08.884]  Childhood vaccines, 1983, children took 10.
[00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:12.782]  In 2013, they took 32.
[00:34:12.782 --> 00:34:15.804]  In 2022, they took 74.
[00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:16.704]  Now, overhead shot.
[00:34:16.704 --> 00:34:18.145]  Here's the autism rates.
[00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:19.206]  In 1983, it was 1 in 10,000.
[00:34:19.206 --> 00:34:19.546]  2013, it was 1 in 88.
[00:34:19.546 --> 00:34:19.886]  2022, it was 1 in 36.
[00:34:19.886 --> 00:34:20.167]  2025, it was 1 in 2.
[00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:31.970]  The shots.
[00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:32.890]  It's the pesticides.
[00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:34.611]  He also gets into that.
[00:34:34.611 --> 00:34:37.013]  And it's dead on, but they know what they're doing.
[00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:39.094]  So here he is on Joe Rogan laying this out.
[00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:08.698]  Oh, and NIH decided to look at it because women were saying it was the vaccine.
[00:35:08.698 --> 00:35:11.421]  Again and again and again and again and again and again and again.
[00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:13.544]  Women were coming with the same story.
[00:35:13.544 --> 00:35:18.270]  I had a perfectly healthy two-year-old exceeded all my this milestones.
[00:35:19.671 --> 00:35:46.922]  I gave them on their second birthday or 18th month wellness visit the full battery of the six or eight vaccines and the and that child spikes a fever that night has a seizure and over the next three months loses their language, loses their capacity to make eye contact, to finger point, social interactions and languages disappear and it happened so many times that NIH was saying we got to look to see if it's the vaccine and CDC was.
[00:35:46.922 --> 00:35:48.203]  So CDC hired a
[00:35:50.353 --> 00:36:03.098]  A Belgian epidemiologist named Thomas Verstraden, and they opened up the Vaccine Safety Data Link, which is the biggest database for vaccines for HMOs.
[00:36:03.098 --> 00:36:13.001]  All the top ten HMOs have all their records in there, so they have all your vaccination records and all your health claims, so you can do these kind of cluster analyses.
[00:36:13.001 --> 00:36:16.142]  And Verstraden went in there and he looked at one thing.
[00:36:16.142 --> 00:36:17.263]  He looked at children who got
[00:36:18.383 --> 00:36:26.048]  The Hepatitis B vaccine within their first month of life and compared those health outcomes in children who did not.
[00:36:26.048 --> 00:36:30.452]  In other words, children who got it after 30 days or didn't get it at all.
[00:36:30.452 --> 00:36:33.374]  That was the second cohort.
[00:36:33.374 --> 00:36:45.442]  What he found in his first run through the data is there was an 1135% greater or elevated risk for an autism diagnosis among the kids who had gotten it in their first 30 days.
[00:36:47.368 --> 00:37:05.076]  At that point they knew what caused the autism epidemic because a relative risk, it's called a relative risk of 11.35, a relative risk of 2 is considered proof of causation as long as there's biological plausibility.
[00:37:05.076 --> 00:37:09.798]  The relative risk of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years and getting lung cancer is 10.
[00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:11.787]  This
[00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:24.270]  I think?
[00:37:54.208 --> 00:38:01.852]  And all the big academics, the people who basically develop vaccines in the academic institutions, and they were all there.
[00:38:01.852 --> 00:38:10.156]  And they spent the first day, they give them all a copy of the restricted study, but they have to give it all back because they don't want it out there.
[00:38:10.156 --> 00:38:13.758]  And then they have a day of talking about it where they're all saying,
[00:38:14.764 --> 00:38:21.869]  Holy cow, this is real, and, you know, the lawyers are going to come after us.
[00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:28.033]  We're all in trouble, and then they spend the second day talking about how to hide it.
[00:38:28.033 --> 00:38:29.174]  How do you know this?
[00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:34.198]  Because somebody made a recording of it, and I got a hold of the transcripts.
[00:38:34.198 --> 00:38:38.200]  And I publish excerpts from those transcripts in Rolling Stone, and anybody can go.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:49.766]  And that's just a five-minute clip from the fascinating interview with R.L.K.
[00:38:49.766 --> 00:38:50.106]  Jr.
[00:38:50.106 --> 00:38:50.667]  and Joe Rogan.
[00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:53.549]  The full thing's up, as I said, on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:53.549 --> 00:38:56.031]  Now, I want to go to another Mark Dice clip.
[00:38:56.031 --> 00:38:57.692]  We're getting a lot of Mark Dice today.
[00:38:57.692 --> 00:38:58.753]  He did a really good job.
[00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:04.157]  In fact, the best job I've seen, better than myself, better than Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in just about 16 minutes.
[00:39:05.078 --> 00:39:13.601]  Laying out what's really going on with the project to sterilize us and manipulate our hormone systems with these chemicals in the food and water.
[00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.282]  And yes, it's premeditated.
[00:39:15.282 --> 00:39:16.502]  And yes, it's a larger plan.
[00:39:16.502 --> 00:39:19.723]  I'm going to come back next hour with the information covering that.
[00:39:19.723 --> 00:39:22.284]  But thank God the world is finally figuring this out.
[00:39:22.284 --> 00:39:26.105]  So we're going to post the full Mark Dice video on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:26.105 --> 00:39:27.706]  It's already up there so you can share it.
[00:39:28.626 --> 00:39:30.527]  But here it is for you right now.
[00:39:30.527 --> 00:39:33.788]  We're going to skip this network break so you can share this and see this.
[00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:34.449]  Mark Dice.
[00:39:34.449 --> 00:39:35.309]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:36.269]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:39:36.269 --> 00:39:39.491]  makes stunning revelation that will rock the media.
[00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:40.851]  He predicted this six days ago.
[00:39:40.851 --> 00:39:41.872]  It did indeed happen.
[00:39:41.872 --> 00:39:42.532]  Here it is.
[00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.111]  So Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:39:45.111 --> 00:40:07.588]  is running for president as a Democrat, of course, against Joe Biden, and is doing interviews with outlets that will dare platform him since the mainstream media is either ignoring him or attacking him, not just because he's opposing Joe Biden, but for his longtime dedication to educating people about some of the dangers about vaccines that you're not supposed to talk about.
[00:40:07.748 --> 00:40:17.892]  And last week, he did an interview with psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson, who, by the way, appears to have endorsed Mike Pence, saying a Pence presidency would restore some normalcy.
[00:40:17.892 --> 00:40:19.773]  That could be a relief.
[00:40:19.773 --> 00:40:20.974]  That's a whole other issue.
[00:40:20.974 --> 00:40:23.815]  Maybe just stay out of politics, doctor.
[00:40:23.815 --> 00:40:32.879]  But he did this interview with Robert F. Kennedy, and he was talking about how he believes that one of the problems that the children are facing today is they've been freaked out by
[00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:38.603]  Climate change alarmism and this apocalyptic talk about the end of the world from climate change.
[00:40:38.603 --> 00:40:40.445]  And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'
[00:40:40.405 --> 00:40:43.608]  's response was absolutely stunning.
[00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:44.929]  I'll play the clip in just a moment.
[00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:46.610]  It's just now starting to go viral.
[00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:52.155]  And when the mainstream media catches wind of it, they're going to attack him for it for numerous reasons.
[00:40:52.155 --> 00:40:56.879]  One of which being that he basically just confirmed that Alex Jones was right.
[00:40:56.879 --> 00:40:59.982]  Again, about, well, just listen.
[00:41:00.362 --> 00:41:12.494]  I think a lot of the problems we see in kids, and particularly boys, it's probably underappreciated how much of that is coming from chemical exposures.
[00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:17.241]  Including a lot of the sexual dysphoria that we're seeing.
[00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:21.584]  You know, these kids are being overwhelmed by a tsunami.
[00:41:21.584 --> 00:41:25.267]  I mean, they're swimming through a soup of toxic chemicals today.
[00:41:25.267 --> 00:41:28.589]  Many of those are endocrine disruptors.
[00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:30.971]  There's atrazine throughout our water supply.
[00:41:30.971 --> 00:41:32.231]  Atrazine, by the way,
[00:41:33.388 --> 00:41:54.740]  If you in a lab put atrazine in a tank full of frogs, it will feminize every frog in there and 10% of the frogs, the male frogs, will turn into fully viable females able to produce viable eggs.
[00:41:56.041 --> 00:42:07.712]  And if it's doing that to frogs, there's a lot of other evidence that it's doing it to human beings as well.
[00:42:07.712 --> 00:42:09.374]  I'm happy to talk about that later.
[00:42:11.601 --> 00:42:22.885]  Blaming this epidemic of depression and despair on people who are, you know, fanning fears of climate is... I think that's oversimplistic.
[00:42:22.885 --> 00:42:24.386]  Now, where have I heard that before?
[00:42:24.386 --> 00:42:32.829]  Oh, that's right, from Alex Jones in that viral clip from, I think, 2016, which his critics are just too dumb to understand.
[00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:38.151]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:39.292]  Do you understand that?
[00:42:41.583 --> 00:42:46.064]  What he's talking about there is atrazine, which like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:50.526]  said, has been found to make the frogs transgender.
[00:42:50.526 --> 00:42:54.928]  And this is not from Infowars.com, this is Berkley News.
[00:42:54.928 --> 00:42:59.490]  The pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females.
[00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:16.154]  Atrazine, one of the world's most widely used pesticides, wreaks havoc on the sex lives of adult male frogs, emasculating three-quarters of them and turning one in ten into females, according to a new study by the University of California, Berkeley biologists.
[00:43:16.414 --> 00:43:21.077]  This is an old article from 2010, because people have known about this for a long time.
[00:43:21.077 --> 00:43:26.681]  And some people say, well, those are just frogs living in the runoff in farmers' fields, right?
[00:43:26.681 --> 00:43:29.443]  I mean, people aren't consuming atrazine!
[00:43:29.443 --> 00:43:30.343]  Ha ha ha!
[00:43:30.343 --> 00:43:31.384]  Oh wait, what's this?
[00:43:31.384 --> 00:43:32.665]  This from the Texas Tribune.
[00:43:46.574 --> 00:43:58.205]  The Environmental Working Group also found that the utilities are testing water during times when the herbicide isn't being used as much and that they may be low-balling the results.
[00:43:58.205 --> 00:44:04.291]  So 500 different districts in Texas alone have found that atrazine is in the drinking water.
[00:44:04.691 --> 00:44:06.632]  This is from not that long ago.
[00:44:06.632 --> 00:44:08.053]  This article is from 2018.
[00:44:08.053 --> 00:44:14.918]  And if you do a quick search for Atrazine in the drinking water, you'll find articles like these.
[00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:19.681]  Elevated Atrazine levels detected in Springfield Greenbrier drinking water.
[00:44:19.681 --> 00:44:20.962]  That's in Tennessee.
[00:44:20.962 --> 00:44:28.486]  Oh, Atrazine, a harmful weed killer, taints tap water for millions in the United States.
[00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:31.889]  Kansas drinking water polluted by Atrazine.
[00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:39.272]  Strict pesticide rules fail to erase threat to Wisconsin's drinking water.
[00:44:39.272 --> 00:44:41.695]  It's in Australia's drinking water.
[00:44:41.695 --> 00:44:53.027]  You may have seen some of my previous videos where I talk about another endocrine disruptor, a synthetic estrogen, BPA bisphenol A, which is found in a lot of food packaging and even in clothes.
[00:44:53.607 --> 00:44:59.529]  If you missed those videos, probably you're not going to find them because I'm terrible at search engine optimization.
[00:44:59.529 --> 00:45:04.250]  I need to get better at writing descriptions and using tags and using keywords and titles and things.
[00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:09.071]  So if you search my YouTube channel for BPA, probably nothing is going to come up.
[00:45:09.071 --> 00:45:11.832]  But I've covered it in previous reports.
[00:45:11.832 --> 00:45:13.572]  And one of the questions you're not supposed to ask.
[00:45:13.732 --> 00:45:28.275]  Particularly with this transgender epidemic going on, is BPA, the synthetic estrogen, altering the estrogen level in the wombs of pregnant mothers and thus feminizing the brains of baby boys?
[00:45:28.275 --> 00:45:35.737]  Because scientists have found that if there's an abnormal estrogen level in the womb, that it affects the INAH3
[00:45:37.697 --> 00:45:38.717]  We're good to go.
[00:46:03.104 --> 00:46:03.964]  We're good to go.
[00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:28.850]  I don't know.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:57.348]  They can't admit that they know what is causing transgenderism or homosexuality, if that's what's causing it.
[00:46:57.348 --> 00:46:59.010]  But that's what the scientists believe.
[00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.852]  That's what the evidence suggests.
[00:47:00.852 --> 00:47:04.515]  In many cases, it could be a social contagion as well.
[00:47:04.515 --> 00:47:10.181]  Sigmund Freud said that it had to do with a disruption of a child's psychosexual development.
[00:47:10.982 --> 00:47:14.404]  It also could have something to do with people who are molested as children.
[00:47:14.404 --> 00:47:20.628]  Also that changes and alters their gender identity and their sexuality in many cases as well.
[00:47:20.628 --> 00:47:34.857]  But Dr. Deborah Soh talks about the horrifying implications for the medical industry because they're not going to be able to admit if that's the cause, that that is the cause, or that it should be stopped or prevented
[00:47:35.237 --> 00:47:42.281]  Or that there should be a cure found for it, because you're not allowed to say that transgender people or gay people have anything wrong with them.
[00:47:42.281 --> 00:48:01.110]  You're only supposed to equate their orientation or their identity being something along the lines of somebody who is right-handed or left-handed, but obviously there's a huge difference between a dominant hand that somebody chooses or is, you know, maybe not even chooses, but writes with or throws with,
[00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:11.394]  Versus people feeling that they're born in the wrong body or dicking things into body orifices that they clearly weren't designed for.
[00:48:11.394 --> 00:48:16.296]  And guess who was warning about all this probably, I don't know, 15 years ago?
[00:48:16.296 --> 00:48:20.297]  I even catch myself, Bob, drinking out of these estrogen mimickers.
[00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:24.439]  But you'll probably say it if it's lined with it inside the plastic packaging.
[00:48:24.439 --> 00:48:25.359]  And they know.
[00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:27.100]  They have immersed us in this, Bob.
[00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:32.833]  For those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, here's the inside of this juice box.
[00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:35.455]  And if they zoom in any more, see that thin plastic?
[00:48:35.455 --> 00:48:37.076]  It's got it.
[00:48:37.076 --> 00:48:43.440]  After you're done drinking your little juices, you're ready to go out and have a baby!
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.681]  You're ready to put makeup on!
[00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:46.443]  You're ready to wear a short skirt!
[00:48:46.443 --> 00:48:48.084]  You're ready to go, you know, uh...
[00:48:49.124 --> 00:48:52.185]  Put together a garden of roses or something.
[00:48:52.185 --> 00:48:53.365]  You're ready to put lipstick on.
[00:48:53.365 --> 00:48:54.726]  I mean, look at this.
[00:48:54.726 --> 00:49:00.507]  Now in the last 10 years, a lot of people have become aware of the dangers of bisphenol A, BPA.
[00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:04.008]  And so a lot of food packaging has taken it out.
[00:49:04.008 --> 00:49:06.589]  But here's an article from back in 2011.
[00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:10.410]  Eating canned soup makes BPA levels soar.
[00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:10.770]  This from 2009.
[00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:11.090]  BPA dangers
[00:49:13.271 --> 00:49:14.952]  And there was some in... juice boxes.
[00:49:30.819 --> 00:49:42.251]  But the lining, which has a BPA component, helps protect the nutrient levels in the juice and helps maintain overall product quality.
[00:49:42.251 --> 00:49:46.095]  So, well, looks like Alex Jones was right again.
[00:49:46.095 --> 00:49:52.262]  But just because it's been taken out of a lot of food packaging recently, or in the last decade, doesn't mean that the damage hasn't already been done.
[00:49:52.902 --> 00:49:58.623]  Or that it's not seeping into women and men through other means.
[00:49:58.623 --> 00:50:09.786]  You might even notice on some of the food packaging actually it'll say BPA free because they know that so many people caught on to it just like they'll be labeled high fructose corn syrup free and you know no GMO.
[00:50:09.786 --> 00:50:16.468]  So I have seen food packaging that says no BPA but this is a report just from last month
[00:50:17.068 --> 00:50:34.683]  Worrisome BPA levels found in sportswear by Nike, Adidas, Patagonia, and more because, well, a lot of the sports gear is made from synthetic fibers because it doesn't absorb the moisture like cotton does and it helps, you know, wick it away.
[00:50:34.683 --> 00:50:41.769]  The Centers for Environmental Health have sent legal notices to eight active sportswear brands after finding high levels of BPA in their clothing.
[00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:54.597]  A chemical that experts have found could potentially increase blood pressure, the risk of cardiovascular disease, oh, and cause infertility and other birth defects to the fetus.
[00:50:54.597 --> 00:50:57.899]  I'm sure that it's just a minute amount seeping into people's bodies, though.
[00:50:57.899 --> 00:50:59.059]  No cause for alarm, right?
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.360]  Oh wait, what's this?
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:14.564]  The Centers for Environmental Health announced that they initiated legal action against 8 active sportswear brands after they found the brands had more than 40 times the legal limit of BPA in their clothes.
[00:51:14.564 --> 00:51:24.847]  Last year, Tucker Carlson made a comment about chemicals in the food turning kids trans, and he was, of course, attacked as being transphobic for that.
[00:51:25.627 --> 00:51:29.008]  And there's the Daily Beast, an online waste of cyberspace.
[00:51:29.008 --> 00:51:36.632]  Compare to Alex Jones, Tucker's new Alex Jones idea, chemicals in the milk that turn the kids trans.
[00:51:36.632 --> 00:51:42.974]  And very soon, if not today, then definitely later this week, the mainstream media is going to be comparing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:51:42.974 --> 00:51:44.855]  to Alex Jones as well for
[00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:54.857]  Daring to point out the evidence that Atrazine and other endocrine disruptors may be causing this gender dysphoria epidemic.
[00:51:54.857 --> 00:52:01.798]  So far on Google News, there is only one article that is mentioning RFK Jr.
[00:52:01.798 --> 00:52:14.220]  talking about Atrazine, and that's from PJ Media, which is an independent outlet, and the headline is, RFK goes where few tread, vindicates the Alex Jones gay frogs conspiracy theory.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.502]  So very soon they're going to be saying that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:52:17.502 --> 00:52:30.352]  is as crazy as Alex Jones and condemn him for daring to say that there's anything wrong with the amazing transgender epidemic that they should only be celebrated.
[00:52:30.352 --> 00:52:32.714]  And anybody who would dare suggest that
[00:52:33.314 --> 00:52:43.158]  They're born with a birth defect or that there's some mass poisoning going on due to endocrine disruptors being in the drinking water or in the food packaging or in the clothing.
[00:52:43.158 --> 00:52:45.920]  Those people are horrible transphobes.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:51.262]  Now, I have not heard Matt Walsh, who is basically the biggest anti-transgender activist out there, who
[00:52:51.642 --> 00:53:08.952]  I have a lot of respect for his film, What Is Woman?, absolutely fantastic, but I have not heard him talk about the INAH region of the brain, or these chemicals, the endocrine disruptors possibly causing abnormal estrogen levels in the womb and feminizing the brains of young boys and causing this.
[00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:12.734]  I could be wrong, I just haven't seen him talking about these issues.
[00:53:12.734 --> 00:53:18.638]  Let me know in the comments below if this is an issue that he has addressed, because instead of just talking about the problem,
[00:53:19.218 --> 00:53:24.999]  We should really start talking about the cause, instead of just the symptoms, talk about the cause.
[00:53:24.999 --> 00:53:37.383]  And if there's anybody who's in a position to raise enough awareness about this in the medical community to actually get some scientists to start doing some serious investigations into this, it's Matt Walsh.
[00:53:37.383 --> 00:53:43.084]  But again, that's an area of inquiry that you're really not allowed to go down as a talk show host or as a scientist.
[00:53:43.444 --> 00:53:53.672]  A couple of the scientists have, like I said, that's covered at the end of Dr. Debra So's book, The End of Gender, but you're only supposed to say that whatever is causing it, it's great!
[00:53:53.672 --> 00:54:04.161]  It's an amazing evolution of mankind and you can't dare say that there's anything abnormal about it or that it should be prevented or cured.
[00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:07.063]  But I got one more point for you to ponder before we wrap this up.
[00:54:07.063 --> 00:54:20.593]  This is from 2015, when Bruce Jenner was first transitioning into Caitlyn, and Bruce Jenner's sexual preference uncertain after cross-sex hormone therapy.
[00:54:20.593 --> 00:54:22.374]  Well, what does that mean, you ask?
[00:54:22.774 --> 00:54:33.256]  Bruce Jenner, who has been married three times and produced six children, could become attracted to men after a powerful element of his transition into a woman takes hold.
[00:54:33.256 --> 00:54:38.217]  This according to medical experts and members of the transgender community.
[00:54:38.217 --> 00:54:47.719]  TMZ has spent several days surveying medical experts who tell us Bruce is in the middle of cross-hormone sex therapy, which involves heavy doses of estrogen.
[00:54:48.519 --> 00:54:57.441]  The estrogen drives down levels of testosterone and the brain feminizes, in the vernacular, he begins to think like a woman.
[00:54:57.441 --> 00:55:03.043]  Several prominent doctors in the field tell us the hormones often change sexual preference.
[00:55:03.043 --> 00:55:07.284]  Not gender identity, big difference, sexual preference.
[00:55:07.284 --> 00:55:16.506]  One leader in the transgender community tells TMZ she says that based on 300 transgenders in various countries, one third of them retained their sexual preference.
[00:55:17.086 --> 00:55:23.995]  One-third identified themselves as bisexual, and one-third changed their sexual preference.
[00:55:23.995 --> 00:55:33.507]  So if giving cross-hormone therapy, if giving estrogen to men, can actually cause them to change their sexual preference,
[00:55:33.988 --> 00:55:57.314]  For the sex that they are attracted to, then why aren't we actually just giving testosterone to transgender boys and men who think that they feel like a woman in order to boost their testosterone levels instead of actually give them cross-hormones to then alter their physical appearance and feminize the brain?
[00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:02.918]  Aren't they really just suffering from a lack of testosterone?
[00:56:02.918 --> 00:56:11.545]  Is it possible that the transgender movement put the cart before the horse and is looking at this entire issue from the completely wrong perspective?
[00:56:11.545 --> 00:56:16.730]  Instead of operating on people's bodies, trying to change their body to match their brain,
[00:56:17.677 --> 00:56:23.559]  Couldn't hormone therapy alter the brain so that it then matches the body that they were born with?
[00:56:23.559 --> 00:56:28.540]  You're not supposed to talk about these things, which sadly is a large part of the problem.
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:28.940]  Whoops!
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.261]  I guess you're not even supposed to call it a problem.
[00:56:31.261 --> 00:56:32.301]  Uh, the issue.
[00:56:32.301 --> 00:56:33.722]  I meant the issue.
[00:56:48.783 --> 00:56:50.723]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:56:50.723 --> 00:56:54.584]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:56:54.584 --> 00:57:02.246]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:57:02.246 --> 00:57:04.447]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:57:04.447 --> 00:57:10.148]  You voted Trump!
[00:57:10.148 --> 00:57:15.949]  You voted Trump!
[00:57:15.949 --> 00:57:16.950]  Yeah!
[00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:18.250]  You're the president.
[00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:44.100]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:57:50.632 --> 00:57:53.753]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:57:53.753 --> 00:57:56.054]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:57:56.054 --> 00:57:59.996]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:57:59.996 --> 00:58:08.940]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:16.724]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:58:17.737 --> 00:58:21.401]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:58:21.401 --> 00:58:27.187]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:58:27.187 --> 00:58:30.210]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:37.277]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:58:37.277 --> 00:58:38.459]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:58:39.139 --> 00:58:43.441]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:58:43.441 --> 00:58:48.384]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:58:48.384 --> 00:58:49.785]  Please take action now.
[00:58:49.785 --> 00:58:57.989]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:58:57.989 --> 00:58:59.430]  That is the hellish future.
[00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:08.015]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:59:08.835 --> 00:59:14.417]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:16.998]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:59:16.998 --> 00:59:22.379]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:59:22.379 --> 00:59:26.320]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:32.202]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:59:32.202 --> 00:59:34.303]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:59:35.083 --> 00:59:36.143]  Or unsigned copies.
[00:59:36.143 --> 00:59:46.486]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:59:46.486 --> 00:59:47.526]  This is an Infowar.
[00:59:47.526 --> 00:59:51.407]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:59:51.407 --> 00:59:56.008]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.008 --> 00:59:57.288]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.754 --> 01:00:22.824]  We're going to come back and get into the Energon disruptors and the larger sterilization program that we're already deeply into, but I want to play a few more minutes of RFK Jr.
[01:00:22.824 --> 01:00:28.649]  on Joe Rogan, talking about the deep state, and we'll go to break and come right back.
[01:00:28.649 --> 01:00:31.692]  Kennedy, you know, did that.
[01:00:31.692 --> 01:00:37.117]  He refused to go to war, so he was surrounded by military industrial complex and
[01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:58.165]  And he learned very early at an intelligence apparatus that he realized early on that the purpose of the CIA and the intelligence apparatus was to create a constant pipeline of new wars for the military-industrial complex three days before he took the oath of office.
[01:00:59.425 --> 01:01:07.813]  Eisenhower, who is the outgoing president, gave what is probably the most important speech in American history, which was, you know, where he warned against the military-industrial complex.
[01:01:07.813 --> 01:01:09.795]  I was at my uncle's inauguration.
[01:01:09.795 --> 01:01:12.397]  I was in Washington that day.
[01:01:12.397 --> 01:01:14.179]  It was a, you know, a six-year-old boy.
[01:01:14.179 --> 01:01:19.924]  And I was sitting on the stands behind him, in front of him, during his inauguration.
[01:01:21.466 --> 01:01:24.008]  And he understood that.
[01:01:24.008 --> 01:01:31.693]  And two months later, the military and intelligence came to him and said, we've got to invade Cuba.
[01:01:31.693 --> 01:01:35.635]  And he was like, I'm not going to Cuba and I'm not going to let the military in.
[01:01:35.635 --> 01:01:39.517]  And they said, well, we've got all these Cubans trained and they're going to go attack Castro.
[01:01:41.013 --> 01:01:42.833]  And he said, we can't, the U.S.
[01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:43.854]  government can't be doing that.
[01:01:43.854 --> 01:01:45.674]  We can't be attacking.
[01:01:45.674 --> 01:01:54.636]  I don't like what Castro's doing down there, but it's not the United States' job to dictate what kind of governments other countries have.
[01:01:54.636 --> 01:01:59.477]  And they said, well, as soon as they land, there's going to be a big revolution.
[01:01:59.477 --> 01:02:01.938]  Everybody's going to rise up and they're going to overthrow Castro.
[01:02:01.938 --> 01:02:03.678]  And he said, well, you can't use the U.S.
[01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:04.199]  military.
[01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:09.300]  And they ended up bringing those guys over with United Fruit boats.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:17.105]  And in the middle of it, in the night, they came to him and said, they're getting wiped out on the beach and you need to send in the military and invade.
[01:02:17.105 --> 01:02:20.327]  And he said, we're not going to do it.
[01:02:20.327 --> 01:02:27.451]  And he snapped out of that meeting and he realized they had been lying to him and trying to trick him.
[01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:32.914]  And he said, I want to take the CIA and shatter it into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.
[01:02:35.973 --> 01:02:44.118]  You know, for the next 1,000 days of his presidency, he was at war with his military and intelligence apparatus.
[01:02:44.118 --> 01:02:45.779]  They tried to get him to go into Laos.
[01:02:45.779 --> 01:02:46.840]  He said no.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.642]  They tried to get him to go into Vietnam with the combat troops.
[01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:54.524]  They said that we need 250,000 combat troops.
[01:02:54.524 --> 01:02:55.405]  He refused.
[01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:58.907]  Everybody around him wanted him to go into Vietnam.
[01:02:58.907 --> 01:03:01.749]  He sent 16,000 military advisors.
[01:03:01.749 --> 01:03:03.490]  That's fewer people than he sent.
[01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:10.873]  to get James Meredith into Ole Miss in Jackson Mississippi to get one black man into school.
[01:03:10.873 --> 01:03:12.234]  He sent Feward and Vietnam.
[01:03:12.234 --> 01:03:14.054]  They weren't allowed to fight.
[01:03:14.054 --> 01:03:14.755]  Many of them did.
[01:03:14.755 --> 01:03:18.396]  They both violated the rules of engagement.
[01:03:18.396 --> 01:03:25.840]  In October of 1963, he heard that some of his Green Berets had been killed over there.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.841]  And he said, I want a total casualty list from Vietnam.
[01:03:29.991 --> 01:03:30.891]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:32.152]  This is historic stuff coming out.
[01:03:58.479 --> 01:04:00.219]  And there's nothing the system can do to stop it.
[01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:02.060]  They try to shut me down, Joe Rogan pops up.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:06.181]  Try to shut that down, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk.
[01:04:06.181 --> 01:04:09.262]  Freedom is incredibly popular.
[01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:12.482]  And so it doesn't matter whether Elon Musk is for real or not.
[01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:17.424]  The point is he's now saying he's one of us because it's so popular and the worm is turning.
[01:04:17.424 --> 01:04:18.264]  So I want to salute
[01:04:20.094 --> 01:04:25.298]  Listeners and viewers out there, for what you've done over the years, because without you, none of this would be happening.
[01:04:25.298 --> 01:04:28.080]  We wouldn't have a good shot at stopping these people.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:35.925]  So again, I thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I thank you for keeping us on air, and I thank you for sharing the articles, the videos, and the clips, because you are changing the world.
[01:04:35.925 --> 01:04:37.707]  Now, some stations don't carry this five minutes.
[01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:48.479]  When we come back, I want to finish up what I covered last hour, the rest of the story on the chemicals in the food and water and the air, and how it's designed to sterilize us, and how we can stop them.
[01:04:48.479 --> 01:04:49.219]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:50.740]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.921]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.483]  Share that link and ban that video.
[01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:07.117]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:05:07.117 --> 01:05:09.938]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:05:09.938 --> 01:05:18.282]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:20.723]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:05:20.723 --> 01:05:23.725]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:05:24.025 --> 01:05:26.608]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:05:26.608 --> 01:05:35.017]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:05:35.017 --> 01:05:36.859]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[01:05:36.859 --> 01:05:43.486]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:05:43.946 --> 01:05:49.134]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:05:49.134 --> 01:05:55.262]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:05:55.262 --> 01:05:57.606]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:06:01.302 --> 01:06:06.986]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:06.986 --> 01:06:11.349]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:19.134]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:19.134 --> 01:06:23.217]  Alright, it's hour number two on this Sunday night transmission.
[01:06:23.217 --> 01:06:25.319]  Thank you so much for joining us on Father's Day.
[01:06:26.673 --> 01:06:35.841]  Remember, all over the Western world they're trying to ban, they have banned, the word mother and father on medical records for children being born and things like that.
[01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:38.063]  This is a sick, evil cult.
[01:06:38.063 --> 01:06:45.769]  They're attacking our very biology to depopulate us and take full control of the survivors.
[01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:51.494]  Now, at the end of the last hour we heard a very important report where I think he does the best job in just 16 minutes or so
[01:06:52.441 --> 01:07:10.148]  Laying out the history of just Bisphenol A and Atrazine in the water alone causing the feminization of men and then causing the hyper-feminization of women which also accelerates them going into puberty early and getting cancer and dying and going into menopause early.
[01:07:10.148 --> 01:07:13.329]  So all of this accelerates your aging, all of it causes premature
[01:07:15.266 --> 01:07:18.808]  Aging and going to puberty early.
[01:07:18.808 --> 01:07:20.308]  It's a very serious situation.
[01:07:20.308 --> 01:07:24.570]  We've covered a lot of the stories, or all the stories pretty much, that Mark covers.
[01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:28.712]  But he does a great job at condensing it all down.
[01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:32.033]  Which we need to do more of and go back to the core research, the core stuff.
[01:07:32.033 --> 01:07:34.974]  But that's what he's trained as a journalist and media analyst.
[01:07:34.974 --> 01:07:36.215]  That's what he actually went to college for.
[01:07:36.215 --> 01:07:38.175]  That's why he does a great job, I guess, doing it.
[01:07:38.175 --> 01:07:41.037]  Me, I'm a totally lay person at it.
[01:07:41.037 --> 01:07:44.358]  And I'm always trying to get Mark on the show, but he's like, hey, you got the reports.
[01:07:45.532 --> 01:07:47.153]  I really like to do it succinctly in the reports.
[01:07:47.153 --> 01:07:47.794]  And he does.
[01:07:47.794 --> 01:07:49.135]  Nobody does it better.
[01:07:49.135 --> 01:07:50.156]  So he put that report out.
[01:07:50.156 --> 01:07:51.917]  We'll put it back on screen.
[01:07:51.917 --> 01:07:52.898]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:07:52.898 --> 01:07:53.639]  I hope you share it.
[01:07:53.639 --> 01:07:55.180]  Mark Dice, Alex Jones is right.
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.541]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:59.103]  makes stunning revelation that will rock the media.
[01:07:59.103 --> 01:08:07.130]  Now, this isn't about Alex Jones making a stunning revelation or Kennedy making a stunning revelation that will rock the media.
[01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.351]  That's a nice tagline.
[01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:09.032]  It's a nice hook.
[01:08:09.032 --> 01:08:10.513]  And it's true.
[01:08:10.513 --> 01:08:12.355]  But it's bigger than Alex Jones or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.681]  And it's on Infowars.com and it's vital you share it.
[01:08:16.681 --> 01:08:22.522]  When I started covering this 15, 16 years ago, suddenly I'd have CNN attacking me.
[01:08:22.522 --> 01:08:24.262]  Fox News attacking me.
[01:08:24.262 --> 01:08:25.222]  Jones is crazy.
[01:08:25.222 --> 01:08:30.584]  He says there's chemicals in the food and water that are lowering your fertility and making men feminine.
[01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:32.184]  I was reading MIT reports.
[01:08:32.184 --> 01:08:33.284]  I was reading Berkeley reports.
[01:08:33.284 --> 01:08:39.845]  I was reading all of the actual science and information.
[01:08:39.845 --> 01:08:42.066]  But they would just take a little clip where I'd say, listen,
[01:08:43.288 --> 01:08:47.151]  This article saying I'm anti-gay or whatever is not accurate.
[01:08:47.151 --> 01:08:49.592]  That's what I said in the full famous gay frog clip.
[01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:50.913]  They cut it out.
[01:08:50.913 --> 01:08:56.097]  This is a chemical so bad, it's literally causing the frogs to become sterile and die.
[01:08:56.097 --> 01:09:00.220]  It literally makes the male frogs, when they have sex with male frogs, that means their species dies.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.683]  So I'm trying to get them to take out the chemicals in the water that are making the freaking frogs gay!
[01:09:05.762 --> 01:09:09.446]  And then I hit a big stack of articles and papers on the desk.
[01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:12.148]  Well, they wanted to get ahead of that and make fun of it.
[01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.890]  And that's what they've done the whole time.
[01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.232]  But it's really boomeranged on them.
[01:09:15.232 --> 01:09:19.656]  So, there's a lot of pushback against this, but it's not just these two chemicals.
[01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.177]  There are hundreds.
[01:09:22.543 --> 01:09:31.989]  Hundreds and hundreds of these that are in the water table, even in well water in most areas, but particularly tap water, and it is just a soup that we're swimming in.
[01:09:31.989 --> 01:09:47.179]  But I gotta tell you, this report that I covered last hour, Dice really knocks it out of the park and explains, in separate medical journals they admit, well, men that start going into transgender treatment to become women, which they don't really become women, but they think they are,
[01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:50.845]  They, on average, become attracted to men.
[01:09:50.845 --> 01:09:57.901]  So a lot of people with gender dysphoria who want to become a woman aren't actually attracted to men, but when they take the hormones, they do!
[01:09:59.164 --> 01:10:09.370]  But then if you say that about people that have gotten birth defects, literally in their brain cells, the studies show that from atrazine and bisphenol A. Oh no, no, it's a gift!
[01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:11.511]  Remember what David Hogg, the anti-gunner, said about me?
[01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.533]  He goes, Jones is a con artist.
[01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:18.075]  He sells water filters on the air, saying you need to filter your water, it's full of chemicals.
[01:10:18.075 --> 01:10:22.278]  Yeah, I sell things you need, so we stay on air and get the truth out and you get a good product.
[01:10:22.278 --> 01:10:24.980]  Our filters are the highest rated for the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:28.121]  But of course I'm telling you the water's full of crap, because it is.
[01:10:28.121 --> 01:10:28.402]  It's like,
[01:10:29.412 --> 01:10:35.136]  Selling, you know, people when, when winter's coming and you go to the mall and they got coats out for sale.
[01:10:35.136 --> 01:10:37.778]  Well look, you're selling coats right before winter starts.
[01:10:37.778 --> 01:10:39.159]  What type of weirdo are you?
[01:10:39.159 --> 01:10:40.800]  Or, or summer's about to start.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.161]  Oh, the swimsuits club.
[01:10:42.161 --> 01:10:44.283]  That's, Dillard's is crazy.
[01:10:44.283 --> 01:10:46.865]  They sell swimsuits in the spring.
[01:10:46.865 --> 01:10:48.066]  Ha ha ha!
[01:10:48.066 --> 01:10:51.809]  They're trying to sell swimsuits like you might need one in the summer.
[01:10:51.809 --> 01:10:52.049]  Or, or
[01:10:53.171 --> 01:10:55.720]  They're trying to sell people gasoline for their car's engines.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.844]  I mean, that's really weird.
[01:10:56.844 --> 01:10:58.870]  Show, they're trying to demonize the normalcy.
[01:11:00.262 --> 01:11:04.623]  Of me saying, hey, we have Alexa, Pure, Water Filtration Systems, highest rated.
[01:11:04.623 --> 01:11:06.963]  They are half the price of the leading competitor.
[01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:09.204]  Some competitors are three times more.
[01:11:09.204 --> 01:11:11.824]  And there's four or five companies that have the highest rated.
[01:11:11.824 --> 01:11:12.824]  There's a bunch that don't.
[01:11:12.824 --> 01:11:13.525]  But it's the best.
[01:11:13.525 --> 01:11:14.745]  And it funds the operation.
[01:11:14.745 --> 01:11:16.185]  Infowars.com.
[01:11:16.185 --> 01:11:19.166]  So yes, I'm trying to sell you filters so we have money to stay on air.
[01:11:19.166 --> 01:11:23.046]  And at the same time, explain to you how real this is and how they make jokes about it.
[01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:25.887]  So, the only place that Kennedy
[01:11:26.912 --> 01:11:27.813]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:11:27.813 --> 01:11:31.796]  and others don't go all the way as this is premeditated.
[01:11:31.796 --> 01:11:39.302]  If you get deeper into Bertrand Russell in the 50s and Aldous Huxley in the 30s and Julian Huxley, his brother, heading up the U.N.
[01:11:39.302 --> 01:11:47.309]  operation at UNESCO, they said we'll use diet injections and injunctions to control people and make them infertile and make them stupid.
[01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:49.199]  And that's an eco-science.
[01:11:49.199 --> 01:11:50.600]  It's in there on the conference room table.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.200]  Bring it to me, please.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.542]  1974, year I was born, published.
[01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.863]  The man later became, wrote the book, the head Y.I.O.
[01:11:55.863 --> 01:11:57.324]  Science R for Obama.
[01:11:57.324 --> 01:12:02.188]  Paul Ehrlich, John P. Holdren, and then his wife, Holdren as well.
[01:12:02.188 --> 01:12:03.689]  Or, no, no.
[01:12:03.689 --> 01:12:04.889]  Ehrlich's wife.
[01:12:04.889 --> 01:12:11.234]  So the point is, it says in there, we need to put chemicals in the water to sterilize and lower fertility.
[01:12:11.234 --> 01:12:13.175]  So, and I go on and on and on.
[01:12:13.175 --> 01:12:15.276]  So let me just show you some anecdotal evidence here.
[01:12:16.676 --> 01:12:18.057]  Childhood vaccines.
[01:12:18.057 --> 01:12:18.277]  Again, 1983.
[01:12:18.277 --> 01:12:20.118]  10 vaccines kids were given.
[01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:20.558]  2013, 32 vaccines.
[01:12:20.558 --> 01:12:20.798]  2022, 74 vaccines.
[01:12:20.798 --> 01:12:23.020]  And you see right next to it, autism rates explode as the shots go up.
[01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:39.277]  But it's an exacerbation with all the pesticides, electromagnetics, and the GMO, and all the things that are happening to us.
[01:12:39.277 --> 01:12:44.542]  But yes, it is an agenda to sterilize us, and they tell us it's an agenda.
[01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:46.164]  This book is free online.
[01:12:46.164 --> 01:12:47.185]  You can find the digital copy.
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:53.524]  Once I promoted it and talked about it 15 years ago, it went from being like $5 to buy a hard copy to thousands.
[01:12:53.524 --> 01:12:56.265]  You can buy, I think last time I checked, they were like $2,000 apiece.
[01:12:56.265 --> 01:12:59.648]  But here it all is, how to put stuff in the water to sterilize you and your family.
[01:12:59.648 --> 01:13:02.590]  Ecoscience, population, resources, and environment.
[01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:04.931]  Show!
[01:13:04.931 --> 01:13:06.052]  We bring the documents.
[01:13:06.052 --> 01:13:08.573]  But oh, here's the Washington Post.
[01:13:08.573 --> 01:13:12.136]  Kids are cute, but they're not really eco-friendly.
[01:13:12.136 --> 01:13:15.138]  One less baby helps the planet more than giving up meat or a car.
[01:13:16.894 --> 01:13:17.677]  Your meat, everything.
[01:13:17.677 --> 01:13:18.981]  Carbon's not bad.
[01:13:18.981 --> 01:13:20.346]  Your babies are carbon.
[01:13:20.346 --> 01:13:21.510]  They're being honest now.
[01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:22.253]  They want to get rid.
[01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:25.118]  of the carbon.
[01:13:25.118 --> 01:13:26.519]  That's what this is all about.
[01:13:26.519 --> 01:13:28.460]  And that's why they're sexualizing children.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:29.881]  That's why they're at all the events.
[01:13:29.881 --> 01:13:35.785]  That's why they're telling them that they need to be sterilized and they need to take hormone blockers, which do sterilize you.
[01:13:35.785 --> 01:13:39.627]  It's because this is all an agenda to depopulate on record.
[01:13:39.627 --> 01:13:47.152]  And I show the documents in my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and Endgame 1.5, because I was going to put it on Endgame 2.
[01:13:47.152 --> 01:13:48.313]  Never did, so I put a little addendum.
[01:13:49.213 --> 01:13:53.105]  Just on the subject of chemical sterilization from 1960s and 70s, Pentagon documents.
[01:13:55.396 --> 01:13:58.818]  And make no mistake, it's the people that run the Pentagon that are behind all this.
[01:13:58.818 --> 01:14:00.759]  Look up Pentagon Gay Bomb.
[01:14:00.759 --> 01:14:02.040]  The media always makes a joke about it.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:06.762]  You've seen it on HBO and CNN and all the late night shows.
[01:14:06.762 --> 01:14:10.304]  Steve Colbert and all of them.
[01:14:10.304 --> 01:14:21.651]  They never show me, then showing you the article BBC, Associated Press, Pentagon wanted to spray chemicals on enemy water supplies that literally totally confuse men and make them feminine.
[01:14:21.651 --> 01:14:23.172]  So that's how real
[01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:26.159]  All of this is.
[01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:29.601]  Now I want to shift gears and talk about dictatorship.
[01:14:29.601 --> 01:14:39.045]  I want to talk about the fact that Biden's a puppet, but it's an oligarchy of bureaucrats and corporate interests and intelligence agencies that control Joe Biden.
[01:14:39.045 --> 01:14:41.426]  Tucker dropped his fourth installment.
[01:14:41.426 --> 01:14:43.307]  Yeah, there's Wikipedia on the gay bomb.
[01:14:43.829 --> 01:14:45.431]  The Pentagon Gay Bomb Plan.
[01:14:45.431 --> 01:14:50.095]  So it's a whole project of this, but they've actually launched it on the public.
[01:14:50.095 --> 01:14:51.436]  Then they make it cool.
[01:14:51.436 --> 01:14:56.200]  When, hey, genital sizes are a third of what they were 50 years ago for black and white.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.462]  And, oh, you're sterile.
[01:14:58.462 --> 01:14:59.143]  90% sperm reduction.
[01:14:59.143 --> 01:14:59.743]  It's liberal.
[01:14:59.743 --> 01:15:00.804]  It's trendy.
[01:15:00.804 --> 01:15:02.365]  Oh, you're also getting cancer when you're 25.
[01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:03.306]  Neurological disorders at 25.
[01:15:04.147 --> 01:15:04.907]  But it's okay.
[01:15:04.907 --> 01:15:05.607]  Death is cool.
[01:15:05.607 --> 01:15:06.388]  Death is liberal.
[01:15:06.388 --> 01:15:07.028]  Death is fun.
[01:15:07.028 --> 01:15:07.628]  We love death.
[01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:08.608]  We love death.
[01:15:08.608 --> 01:15:11.629]  But here's Tucker Carlson's fourth historic installment.
[01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:13.629]  News Corp is threatening to sue if he doesn't shut up.
[01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:14.690]  He has free speech.
[01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:15.890]  He's totally backed.
[01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:17.550]  It's a toothless attack.
[01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:23.892]  And then we'll go to this incredibly powerful report pointing out that we do have a dictatorship through the puppet O'Biden.
[01:15:25.217 --> 01:15:27.598]  And that if we don't turn back against this, we have no hope.
[01:15:27.598 --> 01:15:37.723]  But if we wake up to it and legitimately reject it, that it's not Trump, it's not the patriots, it's not the libertarian movement, it's not the conservatives, it's not the populists that want martial law, it's the left that are setting it up.
[01:15:37.723 --> 01:15:38.984]  They're the ones banning speech.
[01:15:38.984 --> 01:15:40.124]  They're the ones banning books.
[01:15:40.124 --> 01:15:43.386]  We're just saying don't give pornographic pedophile books to eight-year-olds.
[01:15:43.386 --> 01:15:44.507]  That's not banning books.
[01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:45.907]  We're saying don't give it to children.
[01:15:45.907 --> 01:15:51.750]  So here he is breaking down the real dictatorship of the globalist being established not just here but worldwide.
[01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:52.831]  And we'll be right back after the break.
[01:15:53.834 --> 01:15:55.495]  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:15:55.495 --> 01:15:59.598]  On Tuesday afternoon, the Biden administration had Donald Trump arrested.
[01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:00.799]  It was a pretty big news story.
[01:16:00.799 --> 01:16:02.420]  You may have seen it.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.540]  Just before 9 p.m.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:09.564]  that night, as part of its coverage, Fox News ran two live video feeds next to one another.
[01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:13.327]  On the right, Donald Trump addressed his supporters in New Jersey.
[01:16:13.327 --> 01:16:17.830]  On the left, Joe Biden spoke at an event for the Secretary General of NATO in Washington.
[01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:32.660]  Beneath those videos, at the bottom of the screen, Fox's banner read this way, quote, Those words were up for less than 30 seconds, but the effect was immediate.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.743]  Inside Fox, the women who run the network panicked.
[01:16:35.743 --> 01:16:38.865]  First, they scolded the producer who put the banner on the screen.
[01:16:38.865 --> 01:16:41.087]  Less than 24 hours after that, he resigned.
[01:16:41.707 --> 01:16:43.389]  He'd been at Fox for more than a decade.
[01:16:43.389 --> 01:16:46.471]  He was considered one of the most capable people in the building.
[01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:52.737]  He offered to stay for the customary two weeks, but Fox told him to clear out his desk and leave immediately.
[01:16:52.737 --> 01:16:58.222]  Then the company issued a public apology for the 27-second-long wannabe dictator line.
[01:16:58.222 --> 01:17:06.070]  Quote, the chyron was taken down immediately, Fox's PR department said, and then added ominously it was, quote, addressed.
[01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:08.491]  That was all true.
[01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:13.535]  But it was not enough to save Fox News from the ensuing scandal.
[01:17:13.535 --> 01:17:20.963]  For a time in the rest of the media, Fox's assessment of Donald Trump's arrest seemed to overshadow Trump's arrest itself.
[01:17:20.963 --> 01:17:24.566]  Suggesting that Biden is a dictator, declared the Washington Post, quote,
[01:17:26.528 --> 01:17:29.170]  Alexander Vindman agreed strongly.
[01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:35.695]  Vindman is the perennial MSNBC guest and full-time Ukraine promoter you may remember from Russiagate.
[01:17:35.695 --> 01:17:40.799]  On Twitter, he demanded that the Pentagon pull Fox News from all military bases.
[01:17:40.799 --> 01:17:51.267]  It is, quote, absolutely unacceptable for American forces network to carry programming that directly, spuriously attacks the commander-in-chief of American armed forces, Vindman wrote.
[01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:58.393]  In other words, Joe Biden must ban all criticism of himself because that's what non-dictators do.
[01:17:58.393 --> 01:18:00.874]  John Cusack went further still.
[01:18:00.874 --> 01:18:07.339]  For the crime of calling Biden a dictator, Fox should be shut down, wrote the 80s era movie star.
[01:18:07.339 --> 01:18:10.862]  Quote, the government has to take away their broadcasting license.
[01:18:10.862 --> 01:18:11.262]  And so on.
[01:18:11.262 --> 01:18:12.323]  It was all over the internet.
[01:18:12.323 --> 01:18:14.605]  Democrats were very, very angry.
[01:18:15.728 --> 01:18:17.750]  But why were they angry?
[01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:21.853]  If the banner on Fox was false, why the hysteria?
[01:18:21.853 --> 01:18:24.896]  Lies don't seem to bother anyone anymore.
[01:18:24.896 --> 01:18:32.943]  If some cable news producer had called Joe Biden a genius, or accused him of being secretly Sudanese, would anyone be yelling about it?
[01:18:32.943 --> 01:18:35.465]  Would Fox News have apologized for it?
[01:18:35.465 --> 01:18:37.086]  Probably not.
[01:18:37.086 --> 01:18:40.809]  But calling Joe Biden a wannabe dictator, that stunk.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.342]  So you've got to wonder, if you're being honest with yourself, is Joe Biden a wannabe dictator?
[01:18:47.342 --> 01:18:50.062]  That question came up yesterday at the White House briefing.
[01:18:50.062 --> 01:18:50.943]  Here's how it went.
[01:18:50.943 --> 01:18:58.325]  Last night, Fox News ran a chyron that referred to the president as a wannabe dictator, and I'm wondering if the White House has any comment on that.
[01:18:58.325 --> 01:19:04.467]  So, there are probably about 787 million things that I can say about this.
[01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:09.368]  That was wrong, about what we saw last night, but I don't think I'm going to get into it.
[01:19:09.775 --> 01:19:11.296]  There's no comment on why that's happening?
[01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:13.077]  I think I just commented.
[01:19:13.077 --> 01:19:15.679]  Oh, no comment necessary!
[01:19:15.679 --> 01:19:18.821]  Of course Joe Biden's not a wannabe dictator!
[01:19:18.821 --> 01:19:27.166]  Just because he's trying to put the other candidate in prison for the rest of his life for a crime he himself committed doesn't mean he has a totalitarian impulse.
[01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:29.127]  Come on, that's absurd!
[01:19:29.127 --> 01:19:34.790]  It takes a lot more than jailing your political rivals to earn the title wannabe dictator.
[01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:36.652]  That's the consensus in Washington tonight.
[01:19:37.412 --> 01:19:40.496]  And in some ways, for once, the consensus may be right.
[01:19:40.496 --> 01:19:43.400]  It is not a small thing to be a wannabe dictator.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.862]  It's quite a process.
[01:19:44.862 --> 01:19:45.724]  There are a lot of steps.
[01:19:47.093 --> 01:19:48.714]  First off, there is the money.
[01:19:48.714 --> 01:20:00.198]  The one thing that all dictators have in common is they enrich themselves and their families, their tribe, even as the countries they govern grow steadily poorer and more desperate.
[01:20:00.198 --> 01:20:03.459]  They take kickbacks from businesses and from other dictators.
[01:20:03.459 --> 01:20:07.281]  They use the official functions of their government to funnel cash to themselves.
[01:20:07.901 --> 01:20:10.342]  They don't bother to hide the fruits of this.
[01:20:10.342 --> 01:20:18.224]  They live in garish mansions with big lawns, far from the teeming cities, even as their own citizens languish in growing poverty.
[01:20:18.224 --> 01:20:22.165]  In some cases, literally living in tents on the street.
[01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:23.005]  So they don't really hide it.
[01:20:23.005 --> 01:20:24.565]  It's all pretty blatant.
[01:20:24.565 --> 01:20:26.086]  And ordinary people resent it.
[01:20:26.994 --> 01:20:30.095]  Of course they do, and wannabe dictators know they resent it.
[01:20:30.095 --> 01:20:31.555]  But they don't care.
[01:20:31.555 --> 01:20:34.956]  There's nothing the population can do about it in a dictatorship.
[01:20:34.956 --> 01:20:38.737]  It's no longer possible to fight injustice in a system like that.
[01:20:38.737 --> 01:20:42.718]  People can't gather in large numbers to protest the rule of the dictator.
[01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:47.899]  If they try that, they'll be arrested by his state security services, even years after the fact.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.881]  A visit for men in body armor at the breakfast table.
[01:20:51.881 --> 01:20:53.361]  That happens.
[01:20:53.361 --> 01:20:58.842]  And if citizens persist in believing they can gather in groups to protest, they may be shot to death.
[01:20:58.842 --> 01:21:00.603]  A bullet to the throat.
[01:21:00.603 --> 01:21:11.705]  And then, just to make the humiliation complete, to make the lesson gin clear to everyone else watching, their relatives can be arrested for daring to complain that their children were killed for complaining.
[01:21:13.427 --> 01:21:15.508]  Happens in some places.
[01:21:15.508 --> 01:21:17.229]  Ask Ashley Babbitt's mother.
[01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:18.190]  Here she is in handcuffs.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:39.062]  So don't be like Ashley Babbitt's mother, much less like poor Ashley Babbitt.
[01:21:39.062 --> 01:21:40.683]  She's dead now.
[01:21:40.683 --> 01:21:43.984]  That's the message a wannabe dictator would send.
[01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:48.066]  And by the way, it's not just public protest that would be banned in a dictatorship.
[01:21:48.066 --> 01:21:50.427]  You wouldn't be allowed to complain from your own home.
[01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:59.652]  Unauthorized opinions expressed on the internet would be censored, go too far, press too deep, tell too much truth, and they'll just erase your opinions.
[01:21:59.652 --> 01:22:01.333]  They have no choice, really.
[01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:04.114]  It's a matter, as they say, of trust and safety.
[01:22:04.114 --> 01:22:07.016]  You must trust the leader, or else you will jeopardize his safety.
[01:22:07.896 --> 01:22:10.959]  Not that you really can jeopardize his safety at this point.
[01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.561]  The leader has nuclear weapons, and you don't.
[01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.863]  He'll remind you of that from time to time.
[01:22:15.863 --> 01:22:22.889]  In any case, you're in the process of being disarmed anyway, along with everyone else who has shown questionable loyalty to the leader.
[01:22:22.889 --> 01:22:28.594]  Those who support the regime can keep their weapons and use them freely, including on public transportation.
[01:22:28.594 --> 01:22:30.115]  That's a core civil right for them.
[01:22:30.896 --> 01:22:35.601]  But for those who dissent from the program, self-defense is an unaffordable privilege.
[01:22:35.601 --> 01:22:38.604]  Turn in your guns, Mr. and Mrs. Peaceful Opposition.
[01:22:38.604 --> 01:22:41.026]  You're a danger to society, and we know who you are.
[01:22:42.153 --> 01:22:46.556]  And in fact, the wannabe dictator does know who they are because he knows everything.
[01:22:46.556 --> 01:22:49.238]  Technology has made him all-seeing.
[01:22:49.238 --> 01:23:01.067]  A report in Wired Magazine just this week revealed that the highly non-dictatorial Biden administration is busy tracking the phones of millions of Americans without their knowledge and without bothering to get a warrant.
[01:23:01.747 --> 01:23:09.900]  And at the same time, this same non-dictatorial administration is stockpiling a massive trove of damaging information about these same Americans.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:13.506]  To be used at some point, we are sure, for entirely noble purposes.
[01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:16.873]  So the administration now knows everything.
[01:23:16.873 --> 01:23:21.758]  Where you spend your days, who you talk to, what you think, your porn habits.
[01:23:21.758 --> 01:23:23.139]  Not a big deal.
[01:23:23.139 --> 01:23:30.386]  The administration already knows what you buy, of course, because they've leaned on the big banks to turn over your confidential credit card information.
[01:23:30.386 --> 01:23:34.350]  Not because anyone here is a wannabe dictator, to be clear, but just because.
[01:23:35.251 --> 01:23:43.048]  It's nice to have that information, just in case, in the words of the Fox News PR department, a situation arises that needs to be, quote, addressed.
[01:23:43.048 --> 01:23:43.930]  It's all totally normal.
[01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:45.494]  It's not a dictatorship, okay?
[01:23:46.735 --> 01:23:55.662]  But in the end, the main reason you know Joe Biden is not a wannabe dictator is because he just does not fit the profile as a man.
[01:23:55.662 --> 01:23:56.863]  Dictators have that look.
[01:23:56.863 --> 01:23:59.405]  You know one when you've seen one.
[01:23:59.405 --> 01:24:05.450]  Dictators build cults of personality around themselves, and they use those cults to deny the glaringly obvious.
[01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:15.154]  In his later years, to name just one example, North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung developed an enormous baseball-sized tumor on the back of his neck.
[01:24:15.154 --> 01:24:16.034]  It was huge.
[01:24:16.034 --> 01:24:16.834]  It was grotesque.
[01:24:16.834 --> 01:24:17.595]  It was right there.
[01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:18.695]  You couldn't ignore it.
[01:24:18.695 --> 01:24:21.796]  You couldn't possibly not see it.
[01:24:21.796 --> 01:24:24.017]  But in North Korea, state media did ignore it.
[01:24:24.017 --> 01:24:25.678]  They pretended it didn't exist.
[01:24:25.678 --> 01:24:29.039]  And so, in some important sense, it didn't.
[01:24:29.039 --> 01:24:33.121]  If a tumor grows on a neck, but no one acknowledges it, is it really there?
[01:24:34.718 --> 01:24:38.239]  Thankfully, nothing like that is happening in our country, or ever will.
[01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:45.301]  If Joe Biden ever developed some profound physical or medical problem that was obvious to everybody, journalists would say something.
[01:24:45.301 --> 01:24:46.461]  This is not North Korea.
[01:24:46.461 --> 01:24:48.761]  We don't have state media here.
[01:24:48.761 --> 01:25:02.665]  If Joe Biden was, say, incapable of completing a full sentence, or mistook his sister for his wife, or suddenly started falling down in public for no reason, the New York Times would report on that, and they'd get to the bottom of what was actually happening.
[01:25:03.405 --> 01:25:06.107]  That would be its duty in a free country like ours.
[01:25:06.107 --> 01:25:07.968]  It's not like they would cover it up.
[01:25:07.968 --> 01:25:12.031]  The very idea of a cover-up sounds like a conspiracy theory, a dangerous one, actually.
[01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:13.993]  So stop it.
[01:25:13.993 --> 01:25:18.216]  And by the way, if Joe Biden was a wannabe dictator, he'd have the family to match.
[01:25:18.216 --> 01:25:19.877]  All dictators do.
[01:25:19.877 --> 01:25:22.278]  Saddam Hussein had Uday and Qusay.
[01:25:22.278 --> 01:25:30.965]  They were princelings who lived above the law, indulging their most decadent fantasies with total confidence they would be never held to account by the police.
[01:25:32.099 --> 01:25:35.321]  As the sons of a dictator, they knew they could do exactly what they wanted.
[01:25:35.321 --> 01:25:36.962]  And so that's what they did.
[01:25:36.962 --> 01:25:39.124]  There's no one like that around Joe Biden.
[01:25:39.124 --> 01:25:44.468]  He doesn't have weird sex scandals at the heart of his family that no one in the media will ever talk about.
[01:25:44.468 --> 01:25:49.631]  He doesn't have a ne'er-do-well former nightclub-owning brother who's made a living for 30 years by being related to him.
[01:25:49.631 --> 01:25:50.652]  Not at all.
[01:25:50.652 --> 01:25:51.553]  That's dictator stuff.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:58.523]  Joe Biden doesn't award ridiculous inflated titles to his relatives that the media are then required to take seriously.
[01:25:58.523 --> 01:26:05.846]  He doesn't call people doctor who didn't go to medical school and then force you to nod along like it's real when everyone knows it isn't.
[01:26:05.846 --> 01:26:08.467]  Nikolai Ceausescu did that with his wife Elena.
[01:26:08.467 --> 01:26:09.528]  Joe Biden would never do that.
[01:26:10.481 --> 01:26:12.643]  Nor does Joe Biden dress like a dictator.
[01:26:12.643 --> 01:26:21.491]  He doesn't do photo ops in mirrored sunglasses driving a sports car to convince you that he isn't frail and senile, but instead powerful, virile and wise.
[01:26:21.491 --> 01:26:23.172]  That's just not his style.
[01:26:23.172 --> 01:26:27.736]  If Joe Biden was a dictator, he'd be wearing epaulettes and carrying a tasseled riding crop.
[01:26:27.736 --> 01:26:28.837]  And he isn't yet.
[01:26:28.837 --> 01:26:29.498]  So calm down.
[01:26:30.788 --> 01:26:34.451]  If he was a dictator, Biden's speeches would look like Nuremberg rallies.
[01:26:34.451 --> 01:26:40.475]  A blood-red backdrop, armed soldiers by his side, screaming about crushing his eternal enemies.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:46.481]  Honestly, Biden did come close to that one time last September at a speech in Philadelphia.
[01:26:46.481 --> 01:26:49.101]  But it wasn't in any sense dictatory.
[01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:50.522]  Dictatory!
[01:26:50.522 --> 01:26:51.842]  It was necessary.
[01:26:51.842 --> 01:27:02.824]  As MSNBC assures at the time, quote, See, it was about democracy, not dictatorship.
[01:27:02.824 --> 01:27:04.005]  No cause for alarm.
[01:27:04.005 --> 01:27:06.165]  He is not a dictator.
[01:27:06.165 --> 01:27:10.546]  A dictator would stockpile ammunition for his own bureaucrats, including his tax collectors.
[01:27:11.286 --> 01:27:16.088]  He redefined the legal code to make disloyalty to the regime the most serious crime.
[01:27:16.088 --> 01:27:20.870]  He claimed dominion over the most intimate parts of his citizens' lives.
[01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:26.153]  He defined what attitudes they were allowed to have about sex and religion and how to raise their families.
[01:27:27.062 --> 01:27:33.968]  He would even, in his final grandiose stage of dictatorship, claim ownership of their children.
[01:27:33.968 --> 01:27:35.770]  And Joe Biden wouldn't do that.
[01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:40.354]  And to prove he would never do that, Biden just this week released this video.
[01:27:40.354 --> 01:27:41.895]  These are our kids.
[01:27:41.895 --> 01:27:43.737]  These are our neighbors.
[01:27:43.737 --> 01:27:44.718]  Not somebody else's kids.
[01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:46.079]  They're all our kids.
[01:27:46.079 --> 01:27:50.243]  And our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft.
[01:27:50.243 --> 01:27:53.646]  It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.
[01:27:54.677 --> 01:28:02.780]  LGBTQ Americans, especially children, you're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:03.800]  See?
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.262]  Joe Biden isn't saying your children belong to him like a dictator would.
[01:28:08.262 --> 01:28:10.142]  He's saying something very different from that.
[01:28:10.142 --> 01:28:13.003]  He's saying America's children are, quote, our children.
[01:28:13.003 --> 01:28:14.624]  Not his alone.
[01:28:14.624 --> 01:28:15.484]  Ours.
[01:28:15.484 --> 01:28:20.026]  You share your children with Joe Biden evenly, right down the middle, with alternating weekends.
[01:28:20.868 --> 01:28:25.270]  You've got joint custody with Joe Biden, and you can thank heaven that you do.
[01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:27.171]  A nation is like a family.
[01:28:27.171 --> 01:28:29.152]  Every family has a head, a father.
[01:28:29.152 --> 01:28:31.713]  That's Joe Biden, our nation's father.
[01:28:31.713 --> 01:28:34.295]  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is now his fatherland.
[01:28:34.295 --> 01:28:41.098]  Just don't call it a dictatorship, or we'll have to issue a statement disavowing you.
[01:28:41.098 --> 01:28:43.980]  Younger people say the news is full of lies.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:44.100]  Sen.
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.840]  Kennedy's motorcade.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.502]  239 people know the death of Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:28:53.239 --> 01:28:53.500]  Yeah.
[01:28:58.615 --> 01:29:01.337]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:06.199]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:29:06.199 --> 01:29:11.522]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:29:11.522 --> 01:29:21.548]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to mfullmorestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:29:22.248 --> 01:29:37.527]  Infowarstore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:29:38.107 --> 01:29:40.328]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:40.328 --> 01:29:42.150]  Some of the very best products.
[01:29:42.150 --> 01:29:44.291]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[01:29:44.291 --> 01:29:49.614]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[01:29:49.614 --> 01:29:52.476]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[01:29:52.476 --> 01:29:53.857]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[01:29:53.857 --> 01:29:55.358]  So again, please take action.
[01:29:55.358 --> 01:29:58.160]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:07.127]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:30:07.127 --> 01:30:08.569]  That is a hellish future.
[01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:17.997]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:23.582]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:30:23.582 --> 01:30:25.544]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:30:26.144 --> 01:30:31.527]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[01:30:31.527 --> 01:30:35.469]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:30:35.469 --> 01:30:41.352]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:30:41.352 --> 01:30:43.433]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[01:30:44.213 --> 01:30:45.274]  Or unsigned copies.
[01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:55.645]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:30:55.645 --> 01:30:56.686]  This is an InfoWar.
[01:30:56.686 --> 01:30:58.448]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:30:58.448 --> 01:30:59.549]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[01:30:59.549 --> 01:31:00.230]  Do you like RainForce?
[01:31:00.610 --> 01:31:03.133]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckenladley.
[01:31:03.133 --> 01:31:05.396]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:31:05.396 --> 01:31:11.703]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[01:31:11.703 --> 01:31:15.108]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[01:31:15.108 --> 01:31:16.910]  What I always need is I always need
[01:31:17.410 --> 01:31:19.091]  Some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:31:19.091 --> 01:31:23.032]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:31:23.032 --> 01:31:28.594]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[01:31:28.594 --> 01:31:36.296]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:31:36.296 --> 01:31:41.938]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[01:31:42.398 --> 01:31:43.139]  All right, we love you.
[01:31:43.139 --> 01:31:43.739]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:43.739 --> 01:31:48.803]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:59.712]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[01:31:59.712 --> 01:32:10.421]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist, at InfoWarsTore.com that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils, and more.
[01:32:10.421 --> 01:32:11.482]  We have a turmeric toothpaste,
[01:32:12.315 --> 01:32:24.926]  We have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Pearl Calcium Toothpaste, and we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[01:32:24.926 --> 01:32:27.008]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.349]  They're very, very strong.
[01:32:28.349 --> 01:32:30.431]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[01:32:30.431 --> 01:32:31.512]  Ours don't.
[01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:32.933]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[01:32:32.933 --> 01:32:34.555]  It is just chock-full.
[01:32:35.135 --> 01:32:38.877]  Of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[01:32:38.877 --> 01:32:40.877]  So, it's now back in stock.
[01:32:40.877 --> 01:32:42.438]  It became a best-seller.
[01:32:42.438 --> 01:32:45.679]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at mfullmorestore.com.
[01:32:45.679 --> 01:32:47.280]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.381]  We've got some of that left.
[01:32:48.381 --> 01:32:52.642]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[01:32:52.642 --> 01:32:56.264]  So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, mfullmorestore.com.
[01:33:00.891 --> 01:33:05.527]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.527 --> 01:33:06.812]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:18.715 --> 01:33:21.196]  We are back live on this Sunday transmission.
[01:33:21.196 --> 01:33:27.898]  Owen's going to be live in studio coming up in about 30 minutes with Sunday live at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:27.898 --> 01:33:35.020]  Now, I was interviewed yesterday by Peter McIlvenna, who was a really smart, informative podcaster, but he kind of let me run.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:36.900]  It was about a 40-minute interview.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:44.003]  We'll link it up on Infowars.com to see the full thing, but I want to hear about 25 minutes of it here in just a moment because he asked me some important questions.
[01:33:44.003 --> 01:33:44.323]  I'm nervous.
[01:33:44.323 --> 01:33:45.043]  It's an important
[01:33:45.763 --> 01:33:46.163]  We're good to go.
[01:34:09.468 --> 01:34:12.591]  That said, at least we're in the fight, and I want to commend you all for your support.
[01:34:12.591 --> 01:34:20.759]  But I'm not in competition with Joe Rogan, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or Del Bigtree, or, you know, any of these people.
[01:34:21.670 --> 01:34:22.891]  I love what they're doing.
[01:34:22.891 --> 01:34:24.112]  I love how hardcore they are.
[01:34:24.112 --> 01:34:27.836]  Because the Globals are planning new viral releases, new lockdowns.
[01:34:27.836 --> 01:34:31.760]  But so many other talk show hosts are territorial.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:35.003]  People even ask me, like, why are you even showing clips of Tucker Carlson?
[01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:36.144]  Or why are you showing Joe Rogan clips?
[01:34:36.144 --> 01:34:37.325]  Or why are you showing this?
[01:34:37.325 --> 01:34:39.267]  Because they're good people.
[01:34:39.267 --> 01:34:40.928]  They're really getting more hardcore.
[01:34:40.928 --> 01:34:42.230]  They're really waking up.
[01:34:42.230 --> 01:34:43.811]  Tucker's completely awake.
[01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:44.512]  Joe's about 90% there.
[01:34:46.053 --> 01:34:48.514]  And I'd love to just beat this thing and back this evil off.
[01:34:48.514 --> 01:34:55.198]  We still have crime and some problems and things, but not active evil in charge of the corporations and government.
[01:34:55.198 --> 01:34:56.679]  Wouldn't be openly running the show.
[01:34:56.679 --> 01:34:58.600]  We could, you know, mitigate it.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.381]  And so that's really my goal here, is to be obsolete.
[01:35:01.381 --> 01:35:03.843]  The problem is we're far from obsolete.
[01:35:03.843 --> 01:35:15.409]  And whereas a lot of people now understand things I knew 20 years ago, and that's hurting the globalist agenda, people need to know the big picture and be able to tie it all together, how it's a concerted evil effort.
[01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:18.171]  And that's where we still come in.
[01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:19.231]  So we're not obsolete.
[01:35:19.231 --> 01:35:22.693]  In fact, we're more important than ever to talk about what's coming next.
[01:35:22.693 --> 01:35:28.015]  Yes, everybody can discover we're right about what happened and we predicted it, but we wanted to stop it.
[01:35:28.015 --> 01:35:30.856]  So now I want to stop the rest of their agenda happening.
[01:35:30.856 --> 01:35:34.598]  We've got a good chance now because people now know I'm not exaggerating.
[01:35:34.598 --> 01:35:35.298]  This isn't a game.
[01:35:35.298 --> 01:35:42.902]  And that's why the enemy was so upset by us because they knew I had their number and it integrated all their systems together and really reverse engineered their operations.
[01:35:44.477 --> 01:35:49.499]  I've done an hour and a half plus here this evening and have not plugged one time.
[01:35:49.499 --> 01:35:51.880]  So our biggest problem is me.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:54.381]  I say, hey, only 1% of our listeners buy product.
[01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:59.242]  If 2% bought product, we'd be doing great and be able to expand, not just hold the line.
[01:35:59.242 --> 01:36:03.164]  But if I plug two or three times an hour, we always bring in plenty of money.
[01:36:03.164 --> 01:36:05.605]  If I plug once an hour, we break even.
[01:36:05.605 --> 01:36:07.806]  I have not done my job tonight, so that's my fault.
[01:36:09.281 --> 01:36:11.522]  You're going to have to step up because I haven't done my job.
[01:36:11.522 --> 01:36:13.263]  If you want to keep us on air, turmeric toothpaste.
[01:36:13.263 --> 01:36:16.744]  I didn't think it was a bad idea when my dad came up with it, but I thought, well, that's okay.
[01:36:16.744 --> 01:36:20.086]  I like the tooth whitening toothpaste and, you know, the charcoal toothpaste.
[01:36:20.086 --> 01:36:20.826]  That's my idea.
[01:36:20.826 --> 01:36:24.528]  That's already a best seller, so we just made a better version of it.
[01:36:24.528 --> 01:36:26.349]  This has been the all-time best-selling toothpaste.
[01:36:27.276 --> 01:36:28.817]  And it sold out the first two runs.
[01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:30.158]  It finally came back in.
[01:36:30.158 --> 01:36:30.959]  There's no fillers.
[01:36:30.959 --> 01:36:31.679]  It's full of turmeric.
[01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:33.360]  So good for your gums, your teeth, your whole body.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.822]  And a bunch of essential oils that are amazing as well.
[01:36:35.822 --> 01:36:36.942]  And it keeps us on air.
[01:36:36.942 --> 01:36:40.865]  Back in stock, your turmeric toothpaste at infowarestore.com.
[01:36:40.865 --> 01:36:43.987]  And we have the tooth whitening toothpaste that's, by the way, selling out.
[01:36:43.987 --> 01:36:49.591]  And we have the charcoal toothpaste, which is popular as well, just not as popular as the turmeric.
[01:36:49.591 --> 01:36:53.693]  So all three are in stock right now, but soon will be sold out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[01:36:53.693 --> 01:36:54.434]  And we haven't had that.
[01:36:55.572 --> 01:36:58.034]  Six months, got a small shipment in.
[01:36:58.034 --> 01:37:01.077]  Also, Super Female Vitality has come back in.
[01:37:01.077 --> 01:37:02.798]  It's the same formula, super male.
[01:37:02.798 --> 01:37:05.401]  Male has a blue label, female has a pink label.
[01:37:05.401 --> 01:37:07.743]  People want a different label, but it does the same thing.
[01:37:07.743 --> 01:37:09.384]  Libido, stamina, energy.
[01:37:09.384 --> 01:37:14.789]  It's 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:37:14.789 --> 01:37:16.770]  But whether it's an Alexa Pure water filtration system,
[01:37:20.053 --> 01:37:20.253]  I think so.
[01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:42.629]  Goji berry, a turmeric, a list goes on and on.
[01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:48.172]  That is incredible for your whole energy and your bones and your mind and it's just the superfood.
[01:37:48.172 --> 01:37:49.853]  You think protein powders powerful?
[01:37:49.853 --> 01:37:50.194]  This is like...
[01:37:53.616 --> 01:37:54.176]  Squared.
[01:37:54.176 --> 01:37:55.777]  I mean, this is just the next level.
[01:37:55.777 --> 01:37:57.258]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:57.258 --> 01:37:58.619]  Check out all the products.

[01:38:00.661 --> 01:38:06.004]  And we're going to go now to part of this important podcast I taped yesterday that dropped today.
[01:38:06.004 --> 01:38:07.685]  We'll post the full thing at Infowars.com.
[01:38:07.685 --> 01:38:12.588]  And then Owen Troyer, in 26 minutes, is going to be sitting right here in this chair.
[01:38:12.588 --> 01:38:15.150]  But listen, it's Father's Day.
[01:38:15.150 --> 01:38:16.330]  I made the crew come in.
[01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:17.191]  I came in here.
[01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:19.472]  I wanted to take my daughter swimming or something.
[01:38:19.472 --> 01:38:20.013]  But you know what?
[01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.711]  I need to nail it.
[01:38:21.711 --> 01:38:22.492]  I need to fight harder.
[01:38:22.492 --> 01:38:24.034]  We're so close to winning.
[01:38:24.034 --> 01:38:24.835]  So I'm here.
[01:38:24.835 --> 01:38:25.656]  I need you to decide.
[01:38:25.656 --> 01:38:27.498]  Hey, this is important stuff he's doing.
[01:38:27.498 --> 01:38:29.421]  Plus, he's got some great products.
[01:38:29.421 --> 01:38:32.865]  So for those of you who got the products and liked them and never ordered them again, please go order them.
[01:38:32.865 --> 01:38:36.029]  For those that order products and routinely order them, I thank you.
[01:38:36.029 --> 01:38:38.753]  And for those that never got the products, I mean...
[01:38:40.345 --> 01:38:43.568]  At least go make a donation, then, at m4warsware.com, right at the top.
[01:38:43.568 --> 01:38:46.190]  $5, $10, you're recurring, cancelling time.
[01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:47.832]  The point is, we're fighting for you.
[01:38:47.832 --> 01:38:48.813]  We're in this fight together.
[01:38:48.813 --> 01:38:49.954]  I need your help.
[01:38:49.954 --> 01:38:51.095]  You need my help.
[01:38:51.095 --> 01:38:53.577]  And we are under major attack, you can see that.
[01:38:53.577 --> 01:38:54.638]  And I don't care about that.
[01:38:54.638 --> 01:38:56.360]  I just want to beat these people.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.380]  And I don't just smell blood.
[01:38:58.308 --> 01:38:59.549]  I got their blood all over me.
[01:38:59.549 --> 01:39:00.911]  I got their blood in my mouth.
[01:39:00.911 --> 01:39:02.813]  I use that as an analogy of like an attack dog.
[01:39:02.813 --> 01:39:04.274]  I mean, I ain't smelling blood.
[01:39:04.274 --> 01:39:06.737]  I ain't, I'm not, I'm not smelling victory.
[01:39:06.737 --> 01:39:09.981]  I'm just victory, victory, victory, victory, victory.
[01:39:09.981 --> 01:39:12.704]  All we do is victory, victory, victory, victory, victory.
[01:39:12.704 --> 01:39:13.164]  It's all God.
[01:39:13.164 --> 01:39:13.545]  It's not me.
[01:39:14.205 --> 01:39:17.167]  But, I'll never give up, I'll never give in, I couldn't give out.
[01:39:17.167 --> 01:39:22.912]  I'm asking you though, energize us please, get products you already need, take the action!
[01:39:22.912 --> 01:39:25.074]  The whole world's about action!
[01:39:25.074 --> 01:39:32.299]  Salute those that have taken action, even if you can't buy our products, you know, $12 or $10 toothpaste, I understand that's fine.
[01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:37.143]  At least, for heaven's sake, spread the word about the broadcast, and pray for the broadcast, and I thank you.
[01:39:37.143 --> 01:39:40.946]  Great job crew, all coming up in 24 minutes now, here's part of that report.
[01:39:42.314 --> 01:39:44.036]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:39:44.036 --> 01:39:46.338]  Thanks for having me.
[01:39:46.338 --> 01:39:47.639]  Not at all.
[01:39:47.639 --> 01:39:49.001]  We'll just jump in.
[01:39:49.001 --> 01:39:53.925]  It's look, it's been nearly 25 years since you started InfoWars.
[01:39:53.925 --> 01:39:55.687]  And I wonder what moved you?
[01:39:55.687 --> 01:39:59.811]  I mean, what was your assessment of what was it that made you decide to actually start something?
[01:40:01.912 --> 01:40:04.474]  Well, Wikipedia says InfoWars started in 1999.
[01:40:04.474 --> 01:40:05.414]  That's not true.
[01:40:05.414 --> 01:40:10.958]  I got the website in 1997, but it says it was registered in 1999.
[01:40:10.958 --> 01:40:12.338]  That's not right.
[01:40:12.338 --> 01:40:21.944]  I got on air in 1994 on Local Access TV as a guest on shows, and then I got my own show in 1995, and I got a local radio show in 1997.
[01:40:21.944 --> 01:40:27.648]  I got syndicated in 1998, and I just, I was aware of what was going on in the world.
[01:40:27.648 --> 01:40:29.149]  I had read a lot of books about
[01:40:29.833 --> 01:40:33.955]  The New World Order and Globalism, because family had given them to me, that were informed.
[01:40:33.955 --> 01:40:41.859]  So I was kind of fast-tracked to know what was coming, and then I saw what family had warned me about when I was young, actually all over the place.
[01:40:41.859 --> 01:40:53.966]  So I began to research not just the books written by the John Birch Society and people like Barry Goldwater, but I started reading stuff by Anthony Sutton, who was the top archivist at Congress.
[01:40:54.685 --> 01:41:06.971]  Then I started actually reading the books he recommended, written by the bad guys, like Georgetown mentor and political science professor, Carol Quigley, who wrote Tragedy and Hope.
[01:41:06.971 --> 01:41:15.855]  So when I was about 18, I read that 1,100-page book that described the entire way they control the world and how U.S.
[01:41:15.855 --> 01:41:19.257]  intelligence emerged with British intelligence after World War II.
[01:41:19.257 --> 01:41:21.998]  Now they were establishing a planetary government and what they wanted to do.
[01:41:23.214 --> 01:41:23.394]  I think?
[01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:51.137]  And even if you're a champion rollerballer, like James Caan is, the executive wants his wife just to execute the power, and takes her and she has to marry him.
[01:41:51.137 --> 01:41:53.539]  And there are no nation-states in the future.
[01:41:53.539 --> 01:42:06.468]  There's only mega-cities, which the globalists say they're going to end the nation-state, and only create these city-states, like we see with the Vatican, or the City of London inside London, or Israel.
[01:42:07.825 --> 01:42:12.329]  That's really the model or what they're setting up in Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:12.329 --> 01:42:13.930]  They call the line.
[01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:17.293]  They're setting up several other sovereign cities within Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:17.293 --> 01:42:19.735]  So that's really the model where they're all exempt.
[01:42:19.735 --> 01:42:21.156]  We're all made poor.
[01:42:21.156 --> 01:42:23.598]  And then a big UN world peace force controls things.
[01:42:23.598 --> 01:42:25.079]  We're all disarmed.
[01:42:25.079 --> 01:42:28.222]  It's really a dystopic system they're establishing and building.
[01:42:28.222 --> 01:42:30.944]  So I learned about it when I was young.
[01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:33.246]  It was kind of background noise.
[01:42:33.246 --> 01:42:36.549]  But then by the time I got out of high school and saw it actually happening,
[01:42:38.849 --> 01:42:42.152]  Then I decided to make it my wife's destiny to fight these people.
[01:42:42.152 --> 01:42:50.400]  And I really innately believe in humanity, was betting on humanity that this was the next big authoritarian totalitarian threat to humanity.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:55.064]  But I knew that communism and Nazism have been spinoffs of this very group in their own writings.
[01:42:56.048 --> 01:42:56.768]  I don't know.
[01:43:19.091 --> 01:43:24.973]  Almost got done, but are a little bit behind, maybe 5-10% behind on, but they basically got most of what they wanted.
[01:43:24.973 --> 01:43:26.854]  Very ambitious strategy by 2020.
[01:43:26.854 --> 01:43:34.197]  Then I, of course, saw their 2030 program that is just absolutely, like, beyond Hitlerian.
[01:43:34.197 --> 01:43:38.219]  You've got the WEF head spokesman saying you're useless eaters, quoting Hitler.
[01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:40.786]  But it's okay because he's Jewish.
[01:43:40.786 --> 01:43:42.487]  It's just totally bizarre.
[01:43:42.487 --> 01:43:44.707]  The future is not human.
[01:43:44.707 --> 01:43:46.188]  Cyborgs will rule by 2047.
[01:43:46.188 --> 01:43:48.208]  You will eat bugs.
[01:43:48.208 --> 01:43:49.729]  You will like it.
[01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:50.409]  We won't have cities.
[01:43:50.409 --> 01:43:51.429]  We'll have communes by 2030.
[01:43:51.429 --> 01:43:53.910]  We're going to depopulate you by 90%.
[01:43:53.910 --> 01:44:00.912]  I mean, I shudder to think how they're going to try to get their goal by 2030.
[01:44:00.912 --> 01:44:01.952]  Their program is falling apart.
[01:44:01.952 --> 01:44:03.012]  They're behind schedule.
[01:44:03.012 --> 01:44:05.373]  But they only accelerate it each time they get behind.
[01:44:06.556 --> 01:44:16.581]  When faced with such a dystopian movement, the average person has a learned helplessness, a normalcy bias, kind of a Stockholm Syndrome thing where people just go, this can't be real.
[01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:17.882]  I just choose to not believe this.
[01:44:17.882 --> 01:44:23.365]  But I will assure you, ladies and gentlemen, all you got to do is watch a WEF event or read their transcripts.
[01:44:23.365 --> 01:44:28.988]  And when you read it, it's so diabolical, it's so Lex Luthor that it's hard to fathom it.
[01:44:28.988 --> 01:44:32.070]  But it's hard to believe that World War II happened and that
[01:44:33.399 --> 01:44:40.026]  You know, 25 million Russians died, 24 million Germans died, and that Hitler ran around and killed tens of millions of people.
[01:44:40.026 --> 01:44:41.968]  I mean, it's just, but it happened.
[01:44:41.968 --> 01:44:49.315]  And we've lived in the West kind of sheltered by the Renaissance and by the fumes of Christianity.
[01:44:49.315 --> 01:44:55.302]  But those fumes have now run low and the fires of liberty have gone out and tyranny is exploding again.
[01:44:56.710 --> 01:45:02.498]  Historically, once the tyranny explodes and lifts its ugly head, there's always a renaissance against it.
[01:45:02.498 --> 01:45:05.102]  So, we are in a do-or-die situation right now.
[01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:17.417]  I watched America Destroyed by Design quite a while ago and then had re-watched it and it actually intrigued me that you were calling out the Communist China.
[01:45:17.417 --> 01:45:20.339]  You're also calling out the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg.
[01:45:20.339 --> 01:45:32.727]  I mean, how has it taken like a decade after at least for most conservative voices to actually understand that China is a threat and even just more recently the Trilateral Commission which isn't really on anyone's radar?
[01:45:34.269 --> 01:45:34.849]  Well, you're right.
[01:45:34.849 --> 01:45:48.639]  I mean, if you look at the Trilateral Commission and the CFR, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and the Politburo of China, there's a couple hundred men and a few women that run the planet.
[01:45:48.639 --> 01:45:51.801]  And they're Europeans and they're Asian.
[01:45:51.801 --> 01:45:54.383]  And there's a few Latin Americans and a few Africans.
[01:45:54.383 --> 01:45:57.085]  But it's mainly European and Asian.
[01:45:59.083 --> 01:46:01.505]  And they are a eugenics cult.
[01:46:01.505 --> 01:46:03.387]  And they want a lot of such technology.
[01:46:03.387 --> 01:46:06.610]  And they do not believe in the public having a future.
[01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:09.412]  And they're extremely dystopic.
[01:46:09.412 --> 01:46:12.014]  I mean, they believe in a dystopic program for humanity.
[01:46:12.014 --> 01:46:21.262]  They believe in collapsing civilization and then using that reorganization to launch a new form of civilization, a technocracy after that.
[01:46:22.388 --> 01:46:23.609]  And I can see the earliest point.
[01:46:23.609 --> 01:46:28.473]  It was a lot of aimless people, and there's a lot of resources getting used, but who puts them in charge making those decisions?
[01:46:28.473 --> 01:46:32.517]  And I think the public should be told this is happening to them.
[01:46:32.517 --> 01:46:42.986]  That sperm counts are down 90%, that they're knowingly allowing industrial chemicals into the food chain that do give us cancer and do make us infertile, and that they brag about how they did that.
[01:46:42.986 --> 01:46:47.630]  So they put Trojan horses, not just the cell phones, to listen to us and track us.
[01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:50.252]  They've got Trojan horses and the GMO crops to sterilize us.
[01:46:51.351 --> 01:46:57.055]  And it's not just that it's, but not, you know, they're not just neglecting us.
[01:46:57.055 --> 01:46:59.696]  They are, they are doing this by design.
[01:46:59.696 --> 01:47:06.520]  As you talk about the Trilateral Commission set up by Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller in the mid 1970s.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:15.466]  It was a super management group, basically like a finance arm of the Bilderberg Group, which is the very top.
[01:47:16.778 --> 01:47:22.219]  There's the same members, to then coordinate the roundtable groups below them to a better level.
[01:47:22.219 --> 01:47:28.500]  So absolutely, the Trilateral Commission is right at the top.
[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:32.141]  But again, if you see who's on the National Security Council of Countries, and you see who's on the U.N.
[01:47:32.141 --> 01:47:37.622]  Security Council, and you see who's, you know, the heads of the central banks, literally, it's a couple hundred people.
[01:47:37.622 --> 01:47:39.343]  And then on the steering committees, it's about 20.
[01:47:39.343 --> 01:47:45.924]  So, you know, Campbell wrote the book, the Committee of 300,
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:47.520]  It's a Campbell.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.681]  I've interviewed him many times.
[01:47:48.681 --> 01:47:49.821]  I'm tired today.
[01:47:49.821 --> 01:47:55.844]  And that was the old name of the British East India Company corporate management.
[01:47:55.844 --> 01:48:01.726]  So when I talk about it being a UK-based thing, it's not an Anglophile or an Anglophobe thing.
[01:48:01.726 --> 01:48:03.087]  It's not the British that run it.
[01:48:03.087 --> 01:48:04.868]  It's not even King Charles.
[01:48:04.868 --> 01:48:15.733]  It's just that that management system of covert corporate control with interlocking corporate directorates, then controlling government militaries, is the model and the
[01:48:17.193 --> 01:48:37.910]  The the center of the wheel of the management directive and directorate and so that's what it is It's the British Empire merged with the US Empire But not to make the Empire for freedom or the people it exploits the people of North America exploits the people of the UK exploits the people of Australia and Canada and everywhere and it is a
[01:48:39.085 --> 01:48:46.749]  System that is in competition with the Renaissance and with productivity and with Christianity, real Christianity, not corporate Christianity.
[01:48:46.749 --> 01:48:50.431]  And so that's why it's at war and has to bring down the first world.
[01:48:50.431 --> 01:48:53.572]  They're not bringing down the first world to raise the third world.
[01:48:53.572 --> 01:48:58.334]  They're lowering the first world so people never aspire to that again.
[01:48:58.334 --> 01:49:01.356]  And so the old world goes down.
[01:49:01.356 --> 01:49:03.197]  We all collapse on each other.
[01:49:03.197 --> 01:49:07.459]  And then the city states will then take on themselves high tech
[01:49:08.443 --> 01:49:09.143]  We're good to go.
[01:49:26.189 --> 01:49:36.476]  Well, some of the organisations more recently, the WF and the WHO, they seem to be blatant in what they want to do.
[01:49:36.476 --> 01:49:37.057]  It's not hidden.
[01:49:37.057 --> 01:49:39.338]  When you were doing this 25 years ago, it was hidden.
[01:49:39.338 --> 01:49:41.680]  You were exposing what they didn't want to expose.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:45.062]  Now they televise some of the WHO stuff.
[01:49:45.062 --> 01:49:52.147]  It is out there and now full movement towards restricting travel with vaccine passports in the next year.
[01:49:53.428 --> 01:49:58.491]  How has that moved away from not being blatant and open from being hidden?
[01:49:58.491 --> 01:50:06.276]  Well that's what's so frustrating about this is I was just successful at getting this out to a large audience.
[01:50:06.276 --> 01:50:10.158]  I certainly did not develop much of the research.
[01:50:10.158 --> 01:50:21.105]  I mean I've gone out and covered things myself and done and you've gotten the latest info but I mean there was a hardcore group of people around the world mainly who worked in military and intelligence who was read into this and
[01:50:21.969 --> 01:50:24.369]  Decided to say, I'm not gonna be part of this.
[01:50:24.369 --> 01:50:30.171]  Like both sides of my family, you know, had people that were working in the military and intelligence.
[01:50:30.171 --> 01:50:34.651]  And that's who I first heard about all this from when I was a small child.
[01:50:34.651 --> 01:50:35.932]  And then it was just background noise.
[01:50:35.932 --> 01:50:43.673]  So, you know, the fact that I knew about this, and then they would deny it existed and say, I made it all up.
[01:50:43.673 --> 01:50:49.134]  And Alex Jones is the guy that came up with this as, you know, been a narrative for many years.
[01:50:49.134 --> 01:50:49.294]  But
[01:50:50.336 --> 01:50:54.899]  Really what's happening is there comes a point that they have to emerge.
[01:50:54.899 --> 01:50:58.222]  And so they're building it behind the scaffolding.
[01:50:58.222 --> 01:50:59.943]  You ever seen a big ship get launched?
[01:50:59.943 --> 01:51:03.345]  They'll have big doors or a big curtain.
[01:51:03.345 --> 01:51:04.426]  They're building the ship behind that.
[01:51:04.426 --> 01:51:09.410]  And then finally, the day to launch the ship comes and they pull back the giant curtains.
[01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:13.172]  And here's this huge, beautiful ship slides off the blocks into the ocean.
[01:51:13.172 --> 01:51:15.854]  And then, you know, they break some champagne on the bow of it.
[01:51:15.854 --> 01:51:19.857]  And so in the last decade, really, they
[01:51:20.635 --> 01:51:24.997]  Pulled back the curtain, showed us the ship, and said, but it's good.
[01:51:24.997 --> 01:51:27.198]  So we were telling them they're building a ship behind there for tyranny.
[01:51:27.198 --> 01:51:28.078]  They're building world government.
[01:51:28.078 --> 01:51:29.019]  They're going to break up the family.
[01:51:29.019 --> 01:51:30.399]  They're going to cut the resources off.
[01:51:30.399 --> 01:51:31.440]  They're going to take your guns.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.000]  They're going to feed your GMO.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.341]  They're going to fry you with 5G.
[01:51:34.341 --> 01:51:38.142]  They're going to, we're reading all their plans because we're behind the curtain.
[01:51:38.142 --> 01:51:43.245]  And then they realize at a certain point, Toto can pull back the curtain.
[01:51:43.245 --> 01:51:46.626]  If they kept denying it while it's out in the open, that would just give us more credibility.
[01:51:47.478 --> 01:51:59.230]  So they passed a Rubicon where they censor and attack and demonize those of us that are critical of the global government, but at the same time unveil it and roll it out as if it's something good and the answer to all the problems that they helped create.
[01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:02.433]  And so we've gone from the mask being on to the emergence.
[01:52:02.433 --> 01:52:03.434]  It's kind of like in World War II.
[01:52:04.827 --> 01:52:08.688]  Submarines would run out of torpedoes really quick, but they had their deck gun to sink ships with.
[01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:19.812]  So the Germans particularly, beyond their big mission, they already sunk a bunch of ships, already used their 10 torpedoes, but there's more ships to blow up, more ships to sink, they gotta rise up and use the deck gun to sink the ships.
[01:52:19.812 --> 01:52:25.374]  And so that's what they've done, is the submarine has emerged and is shooting at us right now, and saying it's shooting at us.
[01:52:25.914 --> 01:52:35.157]  And saying to the intelligent people, resistance is futile, you better roll over right now, nobody can stop us, the future's not human, you better join us.
[01:52:35.157 --> 01:52:38.879]  And a lot of people are going, whoa, this is real, what do I do to get on board?
[01:52:38.879 --> 01:52:43.140]  And then a lot of other people that were asleep just go, eh, nothing you can do.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.301]  And then those of us that knew we could stop it are saying, see, we warned you.
[01:52:46.301 --> 01:52:48.042]  But it doesn't take a majority to stop this.
[01:52:49.125 --> 01:53:00.874]  If anything, when you read Yuval Noah Harari, who's the high priest of these guys, and Ray Kurzweil, and these guys, and Prince Charles, who's King Charles now, and Klaus Schwab.
[01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:03.596]  I mean, I've read their books, I've read their writings, not just their speeches.
[01:53:03.596 --> 01:53:05.818]  They are maniacs.
[01:53:05.818 --> 01:53:06.418]  I mean, they are.
[01:53:06.418 --> 01:53:07.779]  We are invincible.
[01:53:07.779 --> 01:53:08.800]  Humans are going to live forever.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:11.642]  We're about to be gods, but first we've got to get rid of the general public.
[01:53:11.642 --> 01:53:14.464]  And what we're doing is beautiful work, and we're so amazing.
[01:53:14.464 --> 01:53:17.626]  Yeah, Hitler had his thousand-year Reich, and look how long it lasted.
[01:53:19.429 --> 01:53:29.314]  They are purposely trying to invoke mass Stockholm Syndrome in us by pushing this giant utopia that really is a dystopia.
[01:53:29.314 --> 01:53:34.297]  So they're telling us all the dystopia happening is because we haven't submitted their plan.
[01:53:34.297 --> 01:53:37.218]  But you can pull back and see the dystopia is coming from them.
[01:53:37.218 --> 01:53:39.839]  They say global warming is why we had the virus.
[01:53:39.839 --> 01:53:41.040]  Not it came from a lab.
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.001]  And more viruses are coming because we're in the jungles.
[01:53:46.013 --> 01:53:57.542]  You know, oh my gosh, the third world, because of global warming, is coming here, not from two years of lockdowns and mass starvation and a big international Gallup poll of the migrants.
[01:53:57.542 --> 01:53:59.283]  It was 10,000 they did just a few months ago.
[01:53:59.283 --> 01:54:02.246]  97% said, we've been locked down for years.
[01:54:02.246 --> 01:54:03.527]  The farms and ranches are closed.
[01:54:03.527 --> 01:54:04.287]  The factories are closed.
[01:54:04.287 --> 01:54:05.308]  There's no food.
[01:54:05.308 --> 01:54:06.089]  We have to come here.
[01:54:06.089 --> 01:54:08.831]  And the UN organized us in our respective countries to come here.
[01:54:09.131 --> 01:54:18.954]  So the UN turns your food off, locks you up, shuts you down, and then organizes you to then invade the first world, where they're now clients of this group that's just been brought in.
[01:54:18.954 --> 01:54:30.657]  This has all been battle-gamed, war-gamed, actuary, and if we just admit it's happening, and admit it's going on, and stop living in denial, we can then organize, get control of local governments, then national governments, and stop this.
[01:54:30.657 --> 01:54:34.318]  But if we don't, it is the design collapse of all the nation-states,
[01:54:35.339 --> 01:54:45.002]  Huge wars, controlled viral releases to bring in tyranny, safe zone cities that are self-sufficient, and lockdown during viral attacks, while they're in the cities.
[01:54:45.002 --> 01:54:49.504]  It's wink-wink, you want to be in the city, because you need to be in a rural place.
[01:54:50.225 --> 01:54:53.827]  They're going to fly over with a drone and nerve gas you and say it was, you know, the virus.
[01:54:53.827 --> 01:54:55.668]  And I mean, I've seen the plans.
[01:54:55.668 --> 01:54:57.249]  I've seen somebody classified plans.
[01:54:57.249 --> 01:54:59.790]  They reclassified about their drone attack plans.
[01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:05.973]  They can fly over with synthetic opiates that kill you better than a hammer, that dissipate, you know, in just a week or so.
[01:55:05.973 --> 01:55:14.898]  And so it's only going to be people that are in these compact megacities that are going to be protected, but they themselves are going to be under an authoritarian control as well.
[01:55:14.898 --> 01:55:18.560]  So they're going to panic all the money to run into these compact cities.
[01:55:20.929 --> 01:55:23.917]  Well, it's road war on the outside and the rest of us get wiped out.
[01:55:23.917 --> 01:55:24.338]  That's the plan.
[01:55:25.604 --> 01:55:35.186]  You've set out what we face, and in the midst of that, you've built something huge, and your name is far and wide.
[01:55:35.186 --> 01:55:40.047]  The only other person I know who does four hours a day is Steve Bannon.
[01:55:40.047 --> 01:55:49.248]  Tell us how you've grown that through blood, sweat and tears to be the voice of reason worldwide that it is now.
[01:55:49.248 --> 01:55:51.228]  Tell us about that.
[01:55:51.228 --> 01:55:53.309]  Well, I mean, look, I've been on the air since 1994.
[01:55:55.402 --> 01:55:58.303]  And it was all knowing this was real.
[01:55:58.303 --> 01:56:00.543]  Because again, they didn't make a big deal about it.
[01:56:00.543 --> 01:56:03.084]  They were all very humble, very polite people.
[01:56:03.084 --> 01:56:21.768]  But I just was so blessed to grow up around people that my mom's dad, my grandfather was a World War II vet in Army Air Corps, and then worked for the oil companies, but also worked with some inventors on secret weapon projects for the Pentagon.
[01:56:22.791 --> 01:56:25.672]  Uh, and then like I said, his son was, you know, high level and all this.
[01:56:25.672 --> 01:56:28.173]  And then, uh, my dad's other family, my family was like that.
[01:56:28.173 --> 01:56:30.494]  So I was just really, really, really, really blessed.
[01:56:30.494 --> 01:56:32.975]  And they were patriots and they didn't like the way it was going.
[01:56:32.975 --> 01:56:38.176]  So I'm sitting around the, you know, the dinner table when I'm three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years old.
[01:56:38.176 --> 01:56:44.999]  Um, you know, by the time I was like 12 or 13, they didn't really talk about stuff in front of me because, you know, this is all secret stuff they were talking about, but like kids aren't kids.
[01:56:44.999 --> 01:56:45.939]  They're not listening.
[01:56:45.939 --> 01:56:50.901]  So I was knee high to a grasshopper, you know, listening to all this stuff.
[01:56:50.901 --> 01:56:51.401]  And, uh,
[01:56:53.630 --> 01:56:58.294]  And, and, and, and just, you know, being blown away by it.
[01:56:58.294 --> 01:57:02.198]  And then I kind of became a teenager and chased girls and kind of forgot about it.
[01:57:02.198 --> 01:57:04.440]  And then I went to community college, decided I wanted to go to college.
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.322]  And it was all just, America's horrible.
[01:57:06.322 --> 01:57:07.122]  Communism's good.
[01:57:07.122 --> 01:57:08.744]  We're gonna get your guns.
[01:57:08.744 --> 01:57:09.685]  White people are bad.
[01:57:09.685 --> 01:57:09.965]  I'm like,
[01:57:10.583 --> 01:57:11.984]  Well, this is everything I got warned about.
[01:57:11.984 --> 01:57:13.785]  I was like, I better do something about this.
[01:57:13.785 --> 01:57:15.086]  And so that was it.
[01:57:15.086 --> 01:57:19.008]  And then I just like, oh, Access TV is a place because I try to get jobs in radio and they said no.
[01:57:19.008 --> 01:57:21.330]  And I tried to send in tapes of me doing a show.
[01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:24.111]  And I mean, this one, I'm like 18, 19.
[01:57:24.111 --> 01:57:25.752]  And it didn't it didn't discourage me.
[01:57:25.752 --> 01:57:30.235]  And I remember when I was 18, I sent that they were having a contest to hire a new talk show.
[01:57:30.235 --> 01:57:31.356]  So I ended up hiring Jeff Ward.
[01:57:32.282 --> 01:57:42.397]  Uh, but, uh, former NFL kicker, friend of mine now, and I'm, I'm, I'm 18, and, or 19, I guess I'm about 18.
[01:57:42.397 --> 01:57:44.620]  They have a contest that they've gotten rid of their other talk show hosts.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:46.783]  In fact, the new company bought it, they fired everybody.
[01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:56.754]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:56.754 --> 01:58:01.757]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you get them individually.
[01:58:01.757 --> 01:58:04.419]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[01:58:04.419 --> 01:58:05.860]  Two separate formulas.
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:08.462]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:14.686]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown.
[01:58:14.686 --> 01:58:20.269]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's RainForce Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[01:58:20.269 --> 01:58:20.730]  And I love it.
[01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:22.211]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:58:22.211 --> 01:58:26.474]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[01:58:26.474 --> 01:58:29.616]  Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and boom!
[01:58:30.676 --> 01:58:30.857]  Thank you.
[01:58:48.473 --> 01:58:51.195]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
