[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, live!
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  It's Sunday, June 18th, 2023. Father's Day. And I am your host, Alex Jones, very honored and blessed to be here with you tonight.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  And I'm not a big fan of Hallmark holidays. They invented Father's Day, they invented Mother's Day, but at the same time, it's a good thing they invented it.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  They were looking for new holidays to sell products on, cards and things like that, but we should celebrate mothers and fathers, especially when they are under such incredible attack.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  While I was thinking, I don't like kind of Hollywood corporate holidays is what I meant to say. I guess that would be something like Halloween, which was not celebrated until the 50s in this country.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  And overshadows Christian and Catholic holidays of All Saints Eve and remembering those that have passed in your family lineage similar to the Day of the Dead.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  Celebrated in Mexico is about remembering your ancestors and not celebrating ghouls and goblins, but people can do whatever they want.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  The point is, is that that's how they turn Christmas from Jesus into Santa Claus and then Easter into an Easter Bunny with candy eggs.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  They know exactly what they're doing. But in the case of Mother's Day and Father's Day, it's a good, healthy holiday, just like my favorite holiday is Thanksgiving.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  It's about family and getting together and being thankful to God. Not that I'm perfect. I just don't like these fake corporate holidays.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  But I've kind of digressed. What I really don't like is the puppet president that clearly stole the election, Joe Biden, who couldn't get 50 people to a rally and hit in the basement during the campaign.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  And now he's come out in the last few days and spoken against the Second Amendment.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  And for those that are not gun owners who don't know basic stuff, a gun brace does not make a higher caliber go out the barrel.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  You can only shoot the caliber in a gun that the barrel is made for or it'll blow up on you.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  So that's just it's just made up there. And everything else he says is a lie, too. But here he is, his normal bumbling fashion.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  Because a federally licensed gun dealer is required by law to run background checks on those he's selling a weapon to.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  And in most cities down in Philadelphia and New York, areas I know well, like up here, you'd see a truck pull up, pull to the curb and selling weapons, selling guns, selling AR-15, selling weapons.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  Well, guess what? You do that now you go to jail.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  Made it harder for people to buy stabilized brief braces, put a pistol on a brace that turns into a gun.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  Makes it more you can have a higher caliber weapon, a higher caliber bullet coming out of that gun.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  Completely out of his mind. Of course, the only time we've seen trucks pull up and handguns out is Fast and Furious and Eric Holder and the Obama Justice Department.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  That got confirmed. So I guess there are trucks pulling up, handing out guns in Mexico from the ATF.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  They get traced back to the U.S. so they can blame the Second Amendment. But not to be outdone. Here he is with Fetterman.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  Fetterman introducing him and then Fetterman. Well, again, just hear it for yourself.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  And now I'm standing next to the president again, next to a collapsed bridge here.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  And he is here to commit to work with the governor and the delegation to make sure that we get this fixed quick fast as well, too.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  This is a president that is committed to infrastructure. Yeah.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  And then on top of that, the jewel kind of a law of the infraction infraction bill that is going to make sure that there's going to be bridges all across like this,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  all across America getting rebuilt. Earlier today, some comments about the tragic accident in 1995.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  And if you want to stop there, it just goes on and on.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]  It's the horrible gift that just keeps on giving. I'm going to start referring to to Biden as the collapsed bridge, though.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  I'm standing here next to the collapsed bridge. That's just a metaphor for our collapsing country.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  Two of our best selling nootropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  And for a limited time, they're 50 percent off when you get them together or 40 percent off when you get them individually.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  That's Brain Force Ultra that hits really, really quick. And I love it.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  It wears off in two to three hours. So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  I can take it and say nine o'clock at night.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  I stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something and boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then you go right to bed after it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50 percent off by themselves or 40 percent off individually.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  A lot of people love these products.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  They've got five star reviews. But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  50 percent off. Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  It's Sunday, June 18th, 2023.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  It's Father's Day.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  From the front lines of the Information Ward, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  Boy, that's an important holiday.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  It's a modern holiday invented by Madison Avenue as a way to sell people gift cards for Hallmark, but I like it.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  It's a lot better than all the anti-human globalist holidays.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  They're forced on us now with these leftist bullies trying to invade every fast of our lives and make us join their dehumanized depopulation cult.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  I'll be here for the next two hours.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  Then the great Owen Schroyer is coming in for Sunday Night Live.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  It's always an amazing transmission as well.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  OK, I've got to play this, and it's getting so insane that I don't know what to even say at this point.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  But every time Biden talks, he sounds like he's a gibbering, lobotomized gerbil.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  And then Fetterman, who they have to keep months in the hospital every time before they roll him out for just a day or two,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  is up there basically in a bathrobe or in a jumpsuit and is even more brain damaged than Biden.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  And this is just emblematic of the establishment wanting to put completely brain damaged puppets in who will follow any orders they're given.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  People think, oh, this is just a mistake.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  No, they had Herman von Ruppe as the head of the EU for 10 years, didn't know his name, could hardly walk, completely drunk by noon every day.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  I mean, he ran the EU for over 10 years, and the last few years he couldn't even talk.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  They'd have to hold him up at events.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  They'd have world leaders next to him holding him up at the podium.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  He'd be like, oh, women, I like women.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  So the globalists have done this to put these puppets in so they get all the blame while the actual controllers are in the background,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  deindustrializing society, consolidating control, building a breakaway civilization we're talking a lot about here tonight.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  But here's a clip of Biden saying that a gun brace makes a gun a higher caliber and makes it shoot a bigger bullet.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  If you believe that, you believe the moon is made of cheese and again, that the Easter Bunny is a real thing and so is the tooth fairy.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  And then we'll just segue right into Fetterman two days ago, introducing Biden at the bridge collapse.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  Made it harder for people to buy stabilized braces, put a pistol on a brace and it turns into a gun.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  Makes more you can have a higher caliber weapon, a higher caliber bullet coming out of that gun.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  And now I'm standing next to the president again, next to a collapsed bridge here,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000]  and he is here to commit to work with the governor and the delegation to make sure that we get this fixed quick.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  Fast as well, too. This is a president that is committed to infrastructure.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  Yeah. And then on top of that, the jewel kind of a law of the infrastructure,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  infrastructure bill that is going to make sure that there's going to be bridges all across like this, all across America getting rebuilt.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  By the way, the full speech is up there was like a 10 minute event. They're both gibbering morons the entire time.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  But it's not a gibbering moron is the mighty media analyst, Mark Dice, who really broke down the incredible developments the last few days with the Dodgers.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  So here's that report. We'll go to break and be right back.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  Last night, thousands of protesters gathered outside of Dodger Stadium to protest the team re-inviting the none themed drag queen group,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence after they were initially invited.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  Then there was some backlash and then the invitation was rescinded.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  And then the L.A. Dodgers apologized for their terrible homophobia,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  drag queen phobia of not allowing a blasphemous group of Satanists to come and be celebrated and given an award.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  And so to the Catholics and Christians credit up there in Los Angeles,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  thousands of them descended upon the stadium to make their voices heard.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]  It even stunned the local news KTLA. You couldn't believe that Christians are finally getting some guts.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  We've seen this grow since three o'clock. But my goodness.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  Yeah. The protests are in response to one of tonight's honorees, the group known as the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  Rachel, we saw you an hour ago and the crowd has grown exponentially.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  They say that the sisters they feel as though the sisters are mocking Catholicism and its leaders.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  If you take a look here behind us, you can see some of the protests. They are in a parking lot right outside of the stadium.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  I also have a view from Sky 5 up ahead to give you a bird's eye view of this large gathering.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  There have been several speakers, music and prayer.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  And I'm told eventually a peaceful procession that close to a thousand people in total will be gathering here from a number of different Catholic organizations.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  Well, it's about time. In fact, it's long overdue.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  And in attempts to try to appease both the LGBT mafia and the Catholic community and the protesters,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  the Dodgers decided not to award the satanic drag queen nun group their award during the game,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  and instead did it hours earlier when, as you can see, there was basically nobody there.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  This video was shot by the great Savannah Hernandez.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  She's that feisty little Latino who works for Turning Point USA who used to work for Infowars.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]  But a lot of people are getting the wrong impression, thinking that this was the actual game and that everybody boycotted it and nobody showed up.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  But that's not the case. But they did, like I said, give them the award hours earlier,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  because if they would have done this during the actual game, these drag clowns would have been booed off the field.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  This is a shot she took during the actual game.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  So I don't know what the usual attendance is there in Dodger Stadium, but looks a little bit sparse to me.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  Of course, the L.A. Dodgers and, well, literally nobody on Planet Earth would invite a group of drag queens to come and perform,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  dressed up as the prophet Mohammed, because that would be Islamophobic and they wouldn't want to offend the Muslims.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  And they also know that it would literally turn into a terrible tragedy, just like the Draw Mohammed contest back in 2015,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  when some idiots in Texas had a Draw Mohammed contest and then two Muslim gunmen showed up and opened fire.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  And everybody knows that if any organization, let alone a major sports team, were to invite some drag queens who dressed up as Jewish rabbis,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  then the ADL would have that shut down immediately and whoever organized it would be fired and the team would be literally begging for forgiveness.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  But most Christian churches in America and Christians in general over the last decade have become complete cowards,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  afraid of being called homophobes for simply saying that people's sexual behaviors belong in the bedroom, not in a sports stadium,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  and definitely not in schools or classrooms.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  But the Christians who God would not spit out of his mouth for being lukewarm are finally having an effect.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  Major League Baseball actually told the players not to wear any LGBT rainbows on their jerseys during Pride Nights,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  because, well, they know now that there's going to be a massive backlash against those players.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  These kids at a Catholic school in Canada have finally had enough.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  But messages like this were quickly drowned out by the noise of a rowdy crowd.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  Students tearing through Pride posters and dancing on Pride flags.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  It's rude and they're throwing water everywhere, they're looking at us, they're judging us.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  It shouldn't be like that, you're out for a reason.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000]  Rambunctious teens then turned violent, throwing Pride bracelets and other random objects on the road and at people.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  Some kid threw something at my head and then in response to that everyone started cheering.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  There was like a group of guys and they were more like harassing us than supporting us.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]  And if you missed my video yesterday, go check it out, I'll try to remember to leave a link in the description below
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  because kids in American schools, in high schools, and in middle schools are also fed up and finally revolting.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  Also on Thursday in Las Vegas, the US-Mexico men's soccer match was cancelled in the middle of the game
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  because the Mexican fans kept chanting certain words that hurt the LGBTQ people's feelings at the American players.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]  So obviously they're not fans of Pride night either.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden doesn't know what the heck is going on anywhere.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  This is how he wrapped up his speech on Friday, talking about gun control.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  Alright, God save the queen man.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  He doesn't even know which way to go.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  Yes, this way sir.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  I'm praying that God save Donald Trump.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]  I'm going to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]  Hey, what's better, knockout? What's better, down and out? What's better, why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  So one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  That's how our bodies work, they're all very diverse.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]  and sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.

[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  Hydrofluorosolicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  But you can go pay two or three times, there's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading competitor.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  The point is you get the filters at InfowarsWorld.com. They're discounted right now.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  Finally back in stock.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfowarsStore.com
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]  and never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keep us on air.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  Please take action now.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  Pure, nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:07.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:19.159]  And we are back on this Father's Day Sunday live transmission. Mark Dice is a hard guy
[00:20:19.159 --> 00:20:22.639]  to get on. He just says, look, love the show, Alex, but why don't you just air my report
[00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:26.879]  sometimes? And I'm like, well, absolutely. I mean, he's the best when it comes to breaking
[00:20:26.879 --> 00:20:32.920]  down what's happening. So to bookend it with what he just covered with the situation
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.480]  with the Dodgers, here's just a snapshot of the revolt in schools in Canada and the
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.320]  U.S. against the sexualization and brainwashing of the children. Then we'll come back after
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.480]  this segment and get into so much more dealing with the poison shots on our children, RFK,
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.960]  Joe Rogan, and a lot more. But here's Mark Dice.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.240]  It turns out that we're not the only ones sick and tired of the systemic anti-white
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.560]  ism in America and a certain group of people always sticking their private business in everyone's
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.680]  face every chance they get. During the month of June, they're fetish pride month
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:09.280]  because kids now across the country are starting to revolt in high schools and middle schools,
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.399]  which also means the liberal media is extremely upset about this mass awakening. Here's MSNBC
[00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:19.639]  yesterday. This is Jamal. Jamal's a boy who lives in a poor neighborhood. He has a friend
[00:21:19.639 --> 00:21:24.440]  named Kevin who lives in a wealthy neighborhood. All of Jamal's neighbors are African-American
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.200]  and all of Kevin's neighbors are white. That video about systemic racism was part
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.200]  of an assignment that a high school teacher in South Carolina named Mary Wood that she gave
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.879]  to her AP language class back in February. The video was supposed to prepare students for a
[00:21:40.879 --> 00:21:45.639]  writing assignment based on Ta-Nehisi Coates book Between the World and Me, an award-winning,
[00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:50.879]  best-selling memoir that details America's complicated racial past and its present.
[00:21:50.879 --> 00:21:56.800]  But Mary Wood students never got to finish reading that book. Her school's administration
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.480]  stepped in and ordered her to stop teaching it in class after complaints from two students
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.440]  about the video you just saw. Actually, lady, you only played a 15-second clip of a four-minute
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.480]  video, which, as usual, blames white people for all of black people's problems. And it
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.720]  sounds like the kids are tired of the systemic anti-whitism and so they finally stood up and
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.360]  said something about it. But please cry more. Last year, South Carolina state lawmakers
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.560]  passed a rule in the state budget that makes it illegal to use state money to teach any
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:33.800]  ideas related to race, including that an individual by virtue of his race or sex is inherently
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.679]  racist, sexist, or oppressive, and ideas that cause an individual to feel discomfort,
[00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:45.360]  guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race. In other
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.960]  words, they banned critical race theory, which is really a deceptive term that most
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.240]  conservatives still use when they really are talking about and should be using the term
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:00.040]  anti-whitism. But to help everybody transition to the proper terminology, I would define
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:06.440]  critical race theory as a scholarly-sounding cultural Marxist term used to disguise anti-whitism,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.360]  which promotes the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is woven into the fabric of
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.120]  America and remains at the heart of the legal system, schools and universities, corporate
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.960]  institutions, and culture in general, often used by black people to project blame onto white
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.120]  people for all the problems and shortcomings they themselves are responsible for and experience.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.080]  In the emails those two students send to a member of their school board, we know just how
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.320]  uncomfortable these students were. One email reads, in part, hearing the teacher's opinion
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.960]  and watching these videos made me feel uncomfortable. I actually felt ashamed to be
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.080]  Caucasian. I understand an AP language where we are learning to develop an argument and
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.560]  have evidence to support it, yet this topic is too heavy to discuss.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.000]  Well, Kit, I'm glad you sent that email to the school board member, and it's great
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.240]  that it resulted in the assignment getting pulled, but next time you have to come from a place of
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.760]  strength. It's not that it's too heavy to discuss. Use linguistic judo and use their terminology
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:28.600]  against them and say, this is anti-whitism, this is prejudice against white people or hostility toward
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:34.200]  hatred of, stemming from envy or bigotry, and it needs to stop. The students send their complaints
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.679]  not to the teacher, but to a sympathetic school board member who was instrumental in
[00:24:38.679 --> 00:24:44.200]  escalating the matter. That board member, Elizabeth Bernhardt, ran for and won her seat
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:50.360]  with an endorsement from the Lexington County chapter of Moms for Liberty, and Moms for Liberty
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:57.800]  is a fantastic organization which has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.040]  so you know they're cool. Also this week at a high school in Huntington Beach, California,
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:08.679]  a math teacher tried to force the students to watch this LGBTQ fetish propaganda video,
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:15.400]  and so the kids started booing and asking the teacher why they're trying to groom the kids.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:26.360]  Okay, I'll warn you guys now, if you're gonna be inappropriate, I will have to provision down
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.480]  and give all of you a Saturday school for next year, so knock it off.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.440]  Threatening them with a Saturday detention if they didn't participate in her sexual fantasies.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.280]  And at a middle school, I think in Boston, kids did the right thing,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.520]  and the school is freaking out so bad that it made the local news.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.400]  Parents angry at town hall over intolerance at Marshall Simons Middle School.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.400]  Kids were asked to wear rainbow clothes in honor of Pride Spirit Day,
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.360]  but some organized a counter protest wearing red, white and blue or black.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.760]  The principal sharing a statement to families that pride posters were ripped down,
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.240]  stickers ripped up. Some students chanted USA are my pronouns,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.879]  and students showing pride were intimidated.
[00:26:09.879 --> 00:26:13.400]  It was an unruly disruption, in fact.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.720]  These kids remind me of me.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.440]  When I was in middle school in the late 80s and early 90s,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.320]  if a teacher put up a fetish flag in the classroom,
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.600]  we would have torn it down immediately when they're out in the hall in between classes,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.960]  and nobody would have narked.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.080]  And if they put one up again, it would have gotten torn down again,
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.480]  and we would have poured glue in their desk drawers.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.200]  We would have filled their desk full of notes with things you're not allowed to say on social media.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.320]  We wouldn't have even needed the parents to get involved.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.440]  We would have drove them out of town ourselves.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.879]  So bravo kids.
[00:26:43.879 --> 00:26:48.280]  And this is exactly why we need to take over the school boards across the country,
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:54.120]  because this is a school board in Oregon, and this is what they did two years ago.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:00.280]  The BLM and LGBTQ ideology and curricula are shattering the innocence of children,
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.879]  promoting racial divide and negatively impacting the lives of our kids forever.
[00:27:05.879 --> 00:27:10.360]  School board director and vice chair Brian Shannon shares that sentiment.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.639]  In fact, he went so far as to ask his fellow board members
[00:27:13.639 --> 00:27:18.920]  to not only ban Black Lives Matter and pride flags and signs from district buildings,
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:24.040]  but also ban teachers from wearing BLM and pride clothing while at work.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:31.400]  The main goal of this is to get political symbols and divisive symbols out of our schools
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:38.840]  so we can focus on the already difficult task of educating our students in the core subjects.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.520]  In the end, the board voted four to three in favor of a ban.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.480]  See what can happen when normal people take over the school board.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.679]  And it almost didn't happen.
[00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:47.720]  That was a close vote.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.040]  So be sure to get on one.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.679]  And while most Christians in America are cowards who aren't even really Christians,
[00:27:54.679 --> 00:27:56.360]  they're just cultural Christians.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.080]  They've never even read the Bible or the Gospels.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.679]  The first four books of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:05.639]  Muslims, on the other hand, have guts,
[00:28:05.639 --> 00:28:10.520]  and they don't care if people call them mean names like homophobes.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:17.000]  And so an all Muslim city council in a city in Michigan, which they obviously took over,
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:24.360]  they just voted to ban all LGBTQ fetish flags from government property.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.960]  This is how the Muslim children in Canada are being taught to
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.560]  properly respond to the queer cultural insurrection up in their country.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.720]  And this is what a godless country we've become.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.360]  This is a clip from Jeopardy, whose contestants are touted as the most intelligent people
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.600]  in the country who could spout countless useless facts, but don't know this.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.400]  Matthew 6 9 says, Our Father, which art in heaven, this be thy name.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.600]  Hallowed be thy name.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.840]  Yes, also known as the Lord's Prayer.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:06.120]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock and in full restore.com.

[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.440]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.000]  we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.320]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.600]  I just want to thank you all for buying products and then for short,
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.000]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.400]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation,
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.719]  so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time,

[00:30:42.199 --> 00:30:43.800]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.560]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action
[00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:52.600]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new Renaissance that's counting the great reset

[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.520]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.320]  Please take action.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.600]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.199]  of our entire food supply.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.639]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:31:11.639 --> 00:31:15.880]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.679]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:22.040]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.000]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.520]  naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:36.120]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.840]  from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:48.920]  Our info wars life survival shield X3 is hands down the best pure nascent iodine
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:56.120]  stabilized in an activated tri iodine form for a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.240]  Get yours now at info war store.com.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.920]  We have three original one of a kind toothpaste designed by my father,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.880]  a dentist at info war store.com that don't have fillers.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.320]  They're filled with high quality, essential oils and more.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.520]  We have a tumor toothpaste.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.760]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with coral calcium toothpaste.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.560]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.440]  Again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good,
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.960]  not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth, your throat and more.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.960]  These are really game changing toothpaste.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.320]  They're very, very strong.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.400]  Most over the counter toothpaste have fluoride.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.440]  Ours don't.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.960]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.960]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through mother nature.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.400]  So it's now back in stock and became a best seller.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.400]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.760]  And then four short.com.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.360]  We're selling out of the tooth white toothpaste.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.400]  We've got some of that left.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.520]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock,
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.719]  but it's running out as well.
[00:32:53.719 --> 00:32:57.480]  So all three toothpaste in stock for limited time info war store.com.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:05.639]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[00:33:05.639 --> 00:33:07.159]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.120]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.400]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.240]  All right.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.040]  So there's a biological chemical, electromagnetic,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.679]  radiological attack on ourselves, on our population, on our fertility
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.040]  taking place on record right now.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.360]  And someone that's been exposing the vaccines almost as long as I have
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.120]  is Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.480]  And he is the front runner now in major polls against the puppet Biden.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.600]  They are in complete absolute panic mode
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.320]  right now in the establishment.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.920]  Obviously the big Joe Rogan interview.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.880]  We covered it Friday.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.639]  It's up on info wars.com.
[00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:00.199]  It's amazing.
[00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:01.400]  But here's what he breaks down.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.679]  And these numbers are very conservative.
[00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:05.880]  It's actually worse than this in other countries like South Korea
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.400]  with even higher vaccine rates.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.440]  Childhood vaccines.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.200]  1983, children took 10.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.480]  In 2013, they took 32.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.640]  In 2022, they took 74.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.520]  Now overhead shot.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.040]  Here's the autism rates.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.920]  In 1983, it was one in 10,000.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.520]  2013, it was one in 88.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.440]  2022, it was one in 36.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.440]  2025, it was one in two.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.760]  All right, let's set up a spectrum.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.680]  The shots, it's the pesticides.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.640]  He also gets into that.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.840]  And it's dead on, but they know what they're doing.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.000]  So here he is on Joe Rogan laying this out.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.720]  And the pesticide industry, but not by the pharma
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.240]  because it doesn't regulate pharma.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.960]  So it actually did a real science.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.319]  And it said 1989 is the year the epidemic began.
[00:34:49.319 --> 00:34:50.680]  It's a red line.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.120]  And 1989 was the year the vaccine schedule exploded.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.120]  That doesn't mean that's a correlation.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.040]  It does not mean causation,
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.680]  but it is something that should be looked at.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.240]  So NIH decided to look at it
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.440]  because women were saying it was the vaccine
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.160]  again and again and again and again and again and again.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.319]  Women were coming with the same story.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.440]  I had a perfectly healthy two-year-old
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.200]  exceeded all his milestones.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.440]  I gave them on their second birthday,
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.680]  their 18th month wellness visit,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.480]  the full battery of the six or eight vaccines.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.520]  And that child spikes a fever that night,
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.920]  has a seizure, and over the next three months
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.240]  loses their language, loses their capacity.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.920]  Make eye contact to finger point,
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.240]  social interactions and languages disappear.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.120]  And it happened so many times that NIH was saying,
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.880]  we got to look to see if it's the vaccine.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.800]  And CDC was.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:53.240]  So CDC hired a Belgian epidemiologist
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.440]  named Thomas Verstraten.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.360]  And they opened up the vaccine safety data link,
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.840]  which is the biggest database for vaccines for HMOs.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.960]  All the top 10 HMOs have all their records in there.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.800]  So they have all your vaccination records
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.160]  and all your health claims.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.400]  So you can do these kind of cluster analyses.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.680]  And Verstraten went in there
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.960]  and he looked at one thing.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.560]  He looked at children who got the hepatitis B vaccine
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.080]  within their first month of life
[00:36:22.279 --> 00:36:24.600]  and compared those health outcomes
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.800]  in children who did not.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.120]  In other words, children who got it after 30 days
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.440]  or didn't get it at all.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.800]  That was the second cohort.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.040]  What he found in his first run through the data
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.640]  is there was an 1135% greater or elevated risk
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.720]  for an autism diagnosis among the kids
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.800]  who'd gotten it in their first 30 days.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.880]  At that point, they knew what caused the autism epidemic
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.319]  because a relative risk,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.400]  it's called a relative risk of 11.35.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.680]  A relative risk of two is considered proof of causation
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.840]  as long as there's biological plausibility.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.800]  The relative risk of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.040]  for 20 years and getting lung cancer is 10.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.080]  This was 11.35.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.160]  So there was a panic throughout the industry.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.399]  This, you know, as people heard about this study,
[00:37:19.399 --> 00:37:21.960]  CDC wanted to do a meeting
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.600]  with all the big pan germs of the industry.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.960]  They didn't want to do it on CDC campus
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.840]  because then they thought it would be subject
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.760]  to a freedom of information law request.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.520]  They wanted to do it, just keep it secret.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.120]  So they found this retreat center,
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.920]  a Methodist retreat center in Norcross, Georgia
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.880]  called Simpsonwood.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.000]  And they assembled, I think there was 72 people there.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.440]  And they were from the WHO, CDC, NIH, FDA,
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.279]  and all the vaccine companies
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.560]  and all the big academics,
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.960]  the people who basically developed vaccines
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.399]  in the academic institutions.
[00:37:59.399 --> 00:38:00.279]  And they were all there.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.480]  And they spend the first day,
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.120]  they give them all a copy of the study,
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.480]  but they have to give it all back
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.680]  because they don't want it out there.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.279]  And then they have a day of talking about it
[00:38:12.279 --> 00:38:13.399]  where they're all saying,
[00:38:14.359 --> 00:38:16.359]  holy cow, this is real.
[00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:19.880]  And you know, the lawyers are gonna come after us.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.840]  We're all in trouble.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.440]  And then they spend the second day
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.640]  talking about how to hide it.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.760]  How do you know this?
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.680]  Because somebody made a recording of it.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.720]  And I got a hold of the transcripts.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.120]  And I publish excerpts from those transcripts
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:36.840]  in Rolling Zone.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.319]  And anybody can go and read these now on our website.
[00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:42.440]  It's called Simpsonwood.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.880]  And you can read through the whole thing
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.720]  or you can read my Rolling Stone article.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.840]  And that's just a five-minute clip
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.520]  from the fascinating interview with R.O.K. Jr. and Joe Rogan.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.840]  The full thing's up, as I said, on fullwords.com.
[00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:55.880]  Now, I want to go to another Mark Dice clip.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.480]  We're getting to a lot of Mark Dice today.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.920]  He did a really good job.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.200]  In fact, the best job I've seen,
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.840]  better than myself, better than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.359]  in just about 16 minutes,
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.720]  laying out what's really going on with the project
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.480]  to sterilize us and manipulate our hormone systems
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.399]  with these chemicals in the food and water.
[00:39:13.399 --> 00:39:15.000]  And yes, it's premeditated.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.520]  And yes, it's a larger plan.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.120]  I'm going to come back next hour
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.560]  with the information covering that.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.120]  But thank God the world is finally figuring this out.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.760]  So we're going to post the full Mark Dice video
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.800]  on infowars.com.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.640]  In fact, it's already up there, so you can share it.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.359]  But here it is for you right now.
[00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:31.560]  We're going to skip this network break
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.640]  so you can share this and see this.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.080]  Mark Dice, Alex Hills was right.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.640]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. makes stunning revelation
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.240]  that will rock the media.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.680]  He predicted this six days ago.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.640]  It did indeed happen.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.440]  Here it is.
[00:39:43.319 --> 00:39:46.040]  So Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running for president
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.359]  as a Democrat, of course, against Joe Biden,
[00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:51.080]  and is doing interviews with outlets
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.920]  that will dare platform him
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.960]  since the mainstream media is either ignoring him
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.160]  or attacking him,
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.240]  not just because he's opposing Joe Biden,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.720]  but for his long-time dedication
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.680]  to educating people about some of the dangers
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.480]  about vaccines that you're not supposed to talk about.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.680]  And last week, he did an interview
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.760]  with psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson,
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.880]  who, by the way, appears to have endorsed Mike Pence,
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.720]  saying a Pence presidency would restore some normalcy.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.920]  That could be a relief.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.760]  That's a whole other issue.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.560]  Maybe just stay out of politics, doctor.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.040]  But he did this interview with Robert F. Kennedy,
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.040]  and he was talking about how he believes
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.240]  that one of the problems that the children are facing today
[00:40:31.319 --> 00:40:34.680]  is they've been freaked out by climate change alarmism
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.359]  and this apocalyptic talk
[00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:38.359]  about the end of the world from climate change.
[00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:43.319]  And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s response was absolutely stunning.
[00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:44.760]  I'll play the clip in just a moment.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.359]  It's just now starting to go viral.
[00:40:46.359 --> 00:40:48.680]  And when the mainstream media catches wind of it,
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.880]  they're going to attack him for it for numerous reasons,
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.920]  one of which being that he basically just confirmed
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.359]  that Alex Jones was right again about,
[00:40:58.359 --> 00:41:00.120]  well, just listen.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.840]  I think a lot of the problems we see in kids,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.880]  and particularly boys,
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.600]  it's probably underappreciated on that,
[00:41:09.319 --> 00:41:12.440]  how much of that is coming from chemical exposures,
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.120]  including a lot of the sexual dysphoria
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.760]  that we're seeing.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.560]  These kids are being overwhelmed by a tsunami.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.560]  I mean, they're swimming through a soup
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.000]  of toxic chemicals today,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.240]  and many of those are endocrine disruptors.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.920]  There's atrazine throughout our water supply.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.120]  Atrazine, by the way,
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:39.640]  if you in a lab put atrazine in a tank full of frogs,
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.680]  it will feminize every frog in there,
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.279]  and 10% of the frogs, the male frogs,
[00:41:48.279 --> 00:41:52.600]  will turn into fully viable females
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.680]  able to produce viable eggs.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.200]  And if it's doing that to frogs,
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.480]  there's a lot of other evidence
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.800]  that it's doing it to human beings as well.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.240]  And I'm happy to talk about that later,
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.399]  but I don't think blaming this epidemic
[00:42:13.399 --> 00:42:15.080]  of depression on this there,
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.920]  on people who are fanning fears of climate,
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.600]  I think that's over-simplistic.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.120]  Now, where have I heard that before?
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.000]  Oh, that's right, from Alex Jones in that viral clip
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.240]  from, I think, 2016,
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.920]  which his critics are just too dumb to understand.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.080]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.080]  that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.160]  Do you understand that?
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.120]  Serious crap.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.359]  What he's talking about there is atrazine,
[00:42:44.359 --> 00:42:46.520]  which, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said,
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.279]  has been found to make the frogs transgender.
[00:42:50.279 --> 00:42:52.359]  And this is not from Infowars.com.
[00:42:52.359 --> 00:42:54.200]  This is Berkeley News.
[00:43:16.279 --> 00:43:18.520]  This is an old article from 2010,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.920]  because people have known about this for a long time.
[00:43:21.319 --> 00:43:23.800]  Some people say, well, those are just frogs
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.520]  living in the runoff in farmers' fields, right?
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.160]  I mean, people aren't consuming atrazine.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.160]  Oh, wait, what's this?
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.840]  This from the Texas Tribune.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.520]  Toxic herbicide found in many Texans drinking water.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.560]  Nearly 500 water utilities across the state
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.120]  tested positive for atrazine,
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.600]  a weed killer which can lead to harmful health effects.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.800]  According to a new report,
[00:43:46.359 --> 00:43:48.359]  the Environmental Working Group also found
[00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:50.600]  that the utilities are testing water
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.600]  during times when the herbicide isn't being used as much
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.040]  and that they may be low-balling the results.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.960]  So 500 different districts in Texas alone
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.440]  have found that atrazine is in the drinking water.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.440]  And this is from not that long ago.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.000]  This article is from 2018.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.279]  And if you do a quick search
[00:44:10.279 --> 00:44:12.440]  for atrazine in the drinking water,
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.680]  you'll find articles like these.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.840]  Elevated atrazine levels detected
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.560]  in Springfield Greenbrier drinking water.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.760]  That's in Tennessee.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.720]  Oh, atrazine, a harmful weed killer,
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.399]  taints tap water for millions in the United States.
[00:44:28.359 --> 00:44:31.720]  Kansas drinking water polluted by atrazine.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.640]  Strict pesticide rules failed to erase
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.000]  threat to Wisconsin's drinking water.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.480]  It's in Australia's drinking water.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.319]  You may have seen some of my previous videos
[00:44:43.319 --> 00:44:45.399]  where I talk about another endocrine disruptor,
[00:44:45.399 --> 00:44:49.080]  a synthetic estrogen BPA, bisphenol A,
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.480]  which is found in a lot of food packaging
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.399]  and even in clothes.
[00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:54.920]  If you miss those videos,
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.120]  probably you're not gonna find them
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.319]  because I'm terrible at search engine optimization.
[00:44:59.319 --> 00:45:01.399]  I need to get better at writing descriptions
[00:45:01.399 --> 00:45:04.120]  and using tags and using keywords and titles and things.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.240]  So if you search my YouTube channel for BPA,
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.920]  probably nothing is gonna come up,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.640]  but I've covered it in previous reports.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.560]  And one of the questions you're not supposed to ask,
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.080]  particularly with this transgender epidemic going on is,
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.000]  is BPA, the synthetic estrogen,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.480]  altering the estrogen level in the wombs
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.200]  of pregnant mothers and thus feminizing
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.120]  the brains of baby boys?
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.520]  Because scientists have found that
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.319]  if there's an abnormal estrogen level in the womb,
[00:45:33.319 --> 00:45:39.560]  that it affects the INAH3 region of the brain.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.080]  It's part of the hypothalamus
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.560]  that is specifically involved with sexual orientation
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.640]  and gender identity.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.160]  And they found using brain scans
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.440]  that that region of the brain in gay men
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.200]  and in biological men who identify as transgender women
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.920]  or think that they're women is similar
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.480]  to the INAH3 region of the brain in females.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.920]  And so the theory is,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.279]  you're not supposed to talk about this,
[00:46:06.279 --> 00:46:10.040]  is that because of the abnormal hormone levels in the womb,
[00:46:10.359 --> 00:46:16.840]  that region of the brain can grow as a female INAH3 region
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.920]  in the men and that's causing them to feel
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.760]  like they're trapped in the wrong body
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.200]  or that's why they're attracted possibly to same sex
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.600]  because obviously women are attracted to men.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.160]  They have that female area in their brain
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.040]  that's regulating the attraction.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.560]  That could be what's going on here.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.359]  And in her book,
[00:46:34.359 --> 00:46:36.840]  The End of Gender by Dr. Deborah So,
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.040]  who is a neuroscientist,
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.760]  and I'll leave a link to this in the description below.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.000]  She talks about this at the very end
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.279]  and talks about how the implications from this
[00:46:46.279 --> 00:46:48.440]  are so horrifying for the medical establishment
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.880]  because they can't admit that they know
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.960]  what is causing transgenderism or homosexuality
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.160]  if that's what's causing it.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.840]  But that's what the scientists believe.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.600]  That's what the evidence suggests.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.640]  In many cases, it could be a social contagion as well.
[00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:06.200]  Sigmund Freud said that it had to do
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.040]  with a disruption of a child's psychosexual development.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.440]  It also could have something to do
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.200]  with people who are molested as children.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.960]  Also that changes and alters their gender identity
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.440]  and their sexuality in many cases as well.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.760]  But Dr. Deborah So talks about
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.880]  the horrifying implications for the medical industry
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.000]  because they're not going to be able to admit
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.560]  if that's the cause, that that is the cause
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.000]  or that it should be stopped or prevented
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.920]  or that there should be a cure found for it
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.600]  because you're not allowed to say
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.200]  that transgender people or gay people
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.040]  have anything wrong with them.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.800]  You're only supposed to equate their orientation
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.600]  or their identity being something along the lines
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.840]  of somebody who is right-handed or left-handed.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.240]  But obviously there's a huge difference
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.440]  between a dominant hand that somebody chooses
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.120]  or maybe not even chooses but writes with
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.720]  or throws with versus people feeling
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.160]  that they're born in the wrong body
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.319]  or sticking things into body orifices
[00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:11.160]  that they clearly weren't designed for.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.840]  And guess who was warning about all of this?
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.319]  Probably, I don't know, 15 years ago?
[00:48:15.319 --> 00:48:17.800]  I even catch myself, Bob,
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.040]  drinking out of these estrogen mimickers.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.359]  And he'll probably say it if it's lined with it
[00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:24.200]  inside the plastic packaging.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.000]  And they know that they have immersed us in this, Bob.
[00:48:28.279 --> 00:48:30.200]  For those watching on prisonplanet.tv,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.960]  here's the inside of this juice box.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.240]  And if they zoom in anymore, see that thin plastic?
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:35.800]  It's got it.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.760]  Because after you're done drinking your little juices,
[00:48:39.399 --> 00:48:42.359]  well, you're ready to go out and have a baby.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.440]  You're ready to put makeup on.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.200]  You're ready to wear a short skirt.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:51.160]  You're ready to go put together a garden of roses
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:51.960]  or something.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.480]  You're ready to put lipstick on.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.520]  I mean, look at this.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.040]  Now in the last 10 years, a lot of people
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.279]  have become aware of the dangers of Bisphenol A, BPA.
[00:49:00.279 --> 00:49:03.800]  And so a lot of food packaging has taken it out.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.359]  But here's an article from back in 2011.
[00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:10.200]  Eating canned soup makes BPA levels soar.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.800]  This from 2009.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.279]  BPA dangers in your pantry?
[00:49:14.279 --> 00:49:17.720]  Consumer reports finds potentially hazardous chemicals
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.960]  in several canned goods.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.880]  And there was some in juice boxes.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.880]  Nestle defended the levels of BPA in their juicy juice boxes,
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.600]  saying that they're below federal guidelines.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.080]  But the lining, which has a BPA component,
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.359]  helps protect the nutrient levels in the juice
[00:49:38.359 --> 00:49:42.040]  and helps maintain overall product quality.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.880]  So well, looks like Alex Jones was right again.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.319]  But just because it's been taken out
[00:49:47.319 --> 00:49:50.040]  of a lot of food packaging recently or in the last decade
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.520]  doesn't mean that the damage hasn't already been done
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.279]  or that it's not seeping into women and men
[00:49:56.279 --> 00:49:58.359]  through other means.
[00:49:58.359 --> 00:50:00.520]  You might even notice on some of the food packaging,
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.480]  actually, it'll say BPA-free, because they
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.160]  know that so many people caught on to it,
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.359]  just like they'll be labeled high fructose corn syrup free,
[00:50:08.359 --> 00:50:09.560]  no GMO.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.319]  So I have seen food packaging that says no BPA.
[00:50:13.319 --> 00:50:16.840]  But this is a report just from last month,
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.480]  worrisome BPA levels found in sportswear by Nike, Adidas,
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.840]  Patagonia, and more, because, well,
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.760]  a lot of the sports gear is made from synthetic fibers,
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.120]  because it doesn't absorb the moisture like cotton does,
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.440]  and it helps wick it away.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.120]  The Centers for Environmental Health
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.399]  have sent legal notices to eight active sportswear brands
[00:50:39.399 --> 00:50:41.640]  after finding high levels of BPA in their clothing,
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.720]  chemical that experts have found
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.040]  could potentially increase blood pressure,
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.600]  the risk of cardiovascular disease,
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:54.359]  and cause infertility and other birth defects to the fetus.
[00:50:54.359 --> 00:50:56.279]  I'm sure that it's just a minute amount
[00:50:56.279 --> 00:50:57.720]  seeping into people's bodies, though.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.920]  No cause for alarm, right?
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.080]  Oh, wait, what's this?
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.600]  The Centers for Environmental Health
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.240]  announced that they initiated legal action
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.000]  against eight active sportswear brands
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.840]  after they found the brands had more than 40 times
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.359]  the legal limit of BPA in their clothes.
[00:51:14.359 --> 00:51:16.279]  Last year, Tucker Carlson made a comment
[00:51:16.359 --> 00:51:20.279]  about chemicals in the food turning kids trans,
[00:51:20.279 --> 00:51:22.520]  and he was, of course, attacked
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.160]  as being transphobic for that.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.760]  And there's the Daily Beast, an online waste of cyberspace.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.920]  Compared to Alex Jones, Tucker's new Alex Jones idea,
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.440]  chemicals in the milk that turn the kids trans.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.800]  And very soon, if not today,
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.319]  then definitely later this week,
[00:51:39.319 --> 00:51:41.319]  the mainstream media is gonna be comparing
[00:51:41.319 --> 00:51:44.440]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Alex Jones as well
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:48.680]  for daring to point out the evidence that atrazine
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.200]  and other endocrine disruptors
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.680]  may be causing this gender dysphoria epidemic.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:59.319]  So far on Google News, there is only one article
[00:51:59.319 --> 00:52:02.920]  that is mentioning RFK Jr. talking about atrazine,
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:06.120]  and that's from PJ Media, which is an independent outlet.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.040]  And the headline is, RFK goes where few tread
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.200]  vindicates the Alex Jones gay frogs conspiracy theory.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.960]  So very soon, they're gonna be saying
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.040]  that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is as crazy as Alex Jones
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.840]  and condemn him for daring to say
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.359]  that there's anything wrong
[00:52:24.359 --> 00:52:28.279]  with the amazing transgender epidemic,
[00:52:28.279 --> 00:52:30.120]  that they should only be celebrated.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.359]  And anybody who would dare suggest
[00:52:32.359 --> 00:52:35.160]  that they're born with a birth defect
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.720]  or that there's some mass poisoning going on
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.279]  due to endocrine disruptors being in the drinking water
[00:52:40.279 --> 00:52:42.920]  or in the food packaging or in the clothing,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.720]  those people are horrible transphobes.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.240]  Now, I have not heard Matt Walsh,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.600]  who is basically the biggest anti-transgender activist
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.760]  out there, who I have a lot of respect for,
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.200]  his film, What is a Woman, absolutely fantastic.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.440]  But I have not heard him talk about
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.760]  the INAH region of the brain
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.319]  or these chemicals, the endocrine disruptors
[00:53:03.319 --> 00:53:06.120]  possibly causing abnormal estrogen levels in the womb
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.880]  and feminizing the brains of young boys
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.680]  and causing this.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.040]  I could be wrong.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.520]  I just haven't seen him talking about these issues.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.200]  Let me know in the comments below
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.040]  if this is an issue that he has addressed,
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.000]  because instead of just talking about the problem,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.440]  we should really start talking about the cause
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.760]  instead of just the symptoms, talk about the cause.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.080]  And if there's anybody who's in a position
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.560]  to raise enough awareness about this
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.760]  in the medical community to actually get some scientists
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.640]  to start doing some serious investigations into this,
[00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:37.160]  it's Matt Walsh.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.760]  But again, that's an area of inquiry
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.279]  that you're really not allowed to go down
[00:53:40.279 --> 00:53:43.160]  as a talk show host or as a scientist.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.680]  A couple of the scientists have, like I said,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.840]  that's covered at the end of Dr. Debra So's book,
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.200]  The End of Gender, but you're only supposed to say
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:53.560]  that whatever is causing it, it's great.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.600]  It's an amazing evolution of mankind.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.120]  And you can't dare say that there's anything abnormal
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.960]  about it or that it should be prevented or cured.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.720]  But I got one more point for you to ponder
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.840]  before we wrap this up.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.200]  This is from 2015 when Bruce Jenner
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.480]  was first transitioning into Caitlyn
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.960]  and Bruce Jenner's sexual preference uncertain
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.440]  after cross-sex hormone therapy.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.600]  Well, what does that mean, you ask?
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.840]  Bruce Jenner, who has been married three times
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.440]  and produced six children, could become attracted to men
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.960]  after a powerful element of his transition into a woman
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.080]  takes hold.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.400]  This according to medical experts
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.040]  and members of the transgender community.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.320]  TMZ has spent several days surveying medical experts
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.240]  who tell us Bruce is in the middle
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.080]  of cross-hormone sex therapy,
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.640]  which involves heavy doses of estrogen.
[00:54:48.279 --> 00:54:51.000]  The estrogen drives down levels of testosterone
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.840]  and the brain feminizes in the vernacular.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.240]  He begins to think like a woman.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.400]  Several prominent doctors in the field tell us
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.840]  the hormones often change sexual preference,
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.240]  not gender identity, big difference.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.000]  Sexual preference.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.960]  One leader in the transgender community tells TMZ,
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.800]  she says based on 300 transgenders in various countries,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.840]  one third of them retained their sexual preference.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.040]  One third identified themselves as bisexual
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.800]  and one third changed their sexual preference.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.600]  So if giving cross hormone therapy,
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.680]  if giving estrogen to men can actually cause them
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.800]  to change their sexual preference
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.040]  or the sex that they are attracted to,
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.440]  then why aren't we actually just giving testosterone
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.640]  to transgender boys and men
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.279]  who think that they feel like a woman
[00:55:46.279 --> 00:55:49.400]  in order to boost their testosterone levels
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.440]  instead of actually give them cross hormones
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.800]  to then alter their physical appearance
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.560]  and feminize the brain?
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.880]  Aren't they really just suffering
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.680]  from a lack of testosterone?
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.600]  Is it possible that the transgender movement
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.040]  put the cart before the horse
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.440]  and is looking at this entire issue
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.320]  from the completely wrong perspective
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.800]  instead of operating on people's bodies,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.600]  trying to change their body to match their brain,
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.120]  couldn't hormone therapy alter the brain
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.120]  so that it then matches the body
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.320]  that they were born with?
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.840]  You're not supposed to talk about these things,
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.360]  which sadly is a large part of the problem.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.800]  Whoops, I guess you're not even supposed
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.680]  to call it a problem.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.560]  The issue, I meant the issue.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.880]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.400]  You bought a truck! You bought a truck!
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.520]  Ew!
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.520]  Get the fuck out!
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.520]  Get the fuck out!
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.520]  Get the fuck out!
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.520]  What do you want from me?
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.320]  I want you!
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.320]  You're the president.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.320]  You ain't support this shit.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.320]  Muscles.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:42.840]  And you would think everybody in the country
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.040]  is just like, to the bunker.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.600]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.880]  Infowars has had.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.240]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.040]  And it is because of listeners
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.000]  and viewers supporting us.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.560]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.600]  people behind the scenes,
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.880]  the researchers, the writers,
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.960]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.040]  And when you look at Harrison Smith
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:10.840]  and Owen Schroyer
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.320]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.759]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.600]  it's really just incredible.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.240]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.520]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.080]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.279]  Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.960]  I know you spread the word.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.840]  I know you pray for us,
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.480]  and that's wonderful.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.040]  Keep doing it.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.040]  But most viewers and listeners
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.120]  never go to InfowarsStore.com
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.480]  and you never buy great products
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.000]  that enrich and empower your life.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:37.720]  All at the same time,
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.840]  keep us on air.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.840]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.160]  actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.240]  If just 1% more of you took action
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.759]  and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[00:58:46.759 --> 00:58:48.200]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.560]  Please take action now.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.680]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.320]  this book,
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.000]  The Great Reset in the World for the World
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.040]  is a historic book
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.240]  that documents the globalists
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.360]  in their own words,
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.800]  planned for our future.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.160]  That is a hellish future.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.520]  Now you'll be always,
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.480]  while they still allow books,
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.759]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:59:02.759 --> 00:59:04.200]  be able to get an unsigned copy
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.960]  of The Great Reset in the World for the World
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.600]  at bookstores, Amazon or InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.880]  But you will never be able to get
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.720]  another signed copy of the book
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.200]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.759]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:59:16.759 --> 00:59:18.680]  So get your copy of The Great Reset
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.880]  and The War for the World,
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.120]  a signed copy at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.480]  And there is a markup there
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.920]  because this is a fundraiser
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.040]  to keep us on the air.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.279]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[00:59:28.279 --> 00:59:29.160]  and this powerful book.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:29.960]  You'll also know
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.960]  that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.920]  I'm gonna thank those of you
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.200]  that have gotten signed copies of the book
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.880]  or unsigned copies.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.720]  But I wanna encourage all of you
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:38.840]  who haven't yet
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.360]  to go to InfowarsStore.com
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.560]  and get a signed copy
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.160]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.200]  and donate to the library
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.279]  or give them to the local school.
[00:59:46.279 --> 00:59:47.320]  This is an Infowar.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.120]  I'm counting on you
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.080]  and thank you for your support.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.759]  We're going to come back
[01:00:14.759 --> 01:00:16.680]  and get into the Energon Disruptors
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.160]  and the larger sterilization program
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.360]  that we're already deeply into.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.480]  But I wanna play a few more minutes
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.320]  of RFK Junior on Joe Rogan
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.400]  talking about the deep state
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.200]  and we'll go to break
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:26.759]  and come right back.
[01:00:28.279 --> 01:00:28.920]  When Kennedy,
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.080]  you know, did that,
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.160]  he refused to go to war.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.000]  So he was surrounded
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.840]  by military industrial complex
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.960]  and he learned very early
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.640]  and an intelligence apparatus
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.880]  that he realized early on
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.880]  that the purpose of the CIA
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.160]  and the intelligence apparatus
[01:00:48.279 --> 01:00:51.080]  was to create a constant pipeline
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.120]  of new wars
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.440]  for the military industrial complex
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.920]  the day, three days before
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.120]  he took the oath of office,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.320]  Eisenhower, who was the outgoing president,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.440]  gave what is probably
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.560]  the most important speech
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.520]  in American history,
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.400]  which was, you know,
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.440]  where he warned against
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.880]  the military industrial complex.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.640]  I was at my uncle's inauguration.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.080]  I was in Washington that day.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.000]  There's a, you know,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.040]  a six-year-old boy
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.920]  and I was sitting on the stands
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.840]  behind him in front of him
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.880]  during his inauguration.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.800]  And he understood that
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.000]  and two months later,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.600]  the military and intelligence
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.240]  came to him and said,
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.279]  we gotta, uh,
[01:01:28.279 --> 01:01:30.680]  we gotta invade Cuba.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.520]  And he was like,
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.040]  I'm not going to Cuba
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.640]  and I'm not gonna let the military in.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.120]  They said, well,
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.640]  we got all these Cubans trained
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.480]  and they're gonna go attack Castro.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.480]  And he said, well,
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.279]  we can't,
[01:01:42.279 --> 01:01:43.720]  the US government can't be doing that.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.720]  We can't be attacking.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.840]  I don't like what Castro
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.480]  is doing down there,
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.400]  but it's not the United States' job
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.800]  to dictate what kind of governments
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.240]  other countries have.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.080]  And they said,
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.320]  well, as soon as they land,
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.320]  there's going to be a big revolution.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.360]  Everybody's going to rise up
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.800]  and they're going to overthrow Castro.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.279]  And he said, well,
[01:02:02.279 --> 01:02:04.040]  you can't use the US military.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.120]  And they ended up bringing those guys over
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.240]  with United Fruit boats.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.320]  And in the middle of it,
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:11.720]  in the night,
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.600]  they came to him and said,
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.120]  they're getting wiped out on the beach
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.880]  and you need to send in the military
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.920]  and invade.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.640]  And he said,
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.040]  we're not going to do it.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.360]  And he stopped out of that meeting
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800]  and he realized they had been lying to him
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.160]  and trying to trick him.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.120]  And he said,
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.560]  I want to take the CIA
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.640]  and shatter it into a thousand pieces
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.320]  and scatter it to the winds.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.680]  And then,
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.360]  you know,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.960]  for the next thousand days
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.920]  of his presidency,
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.880]  he was at war
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.040]  with his military and intelligence apparatus.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.640]  They tried to get him to go into Laos.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.680]  He said, no.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.560]  They tried to get him to go into Vietnam
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.520]  with the combat troops.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.480]  They said that we need
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.160]  250,000 combat troops.
[01:02:54.279 --> 01:02:55.160]  He refused.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.680]  Everybody around him wanted him
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.880]  to go into Vietnam.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.520]  He sent 16,000 military advisors
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.400]  as fewer people than he sent
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.240]  to get James Meredith into Ole Miss
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.440]  in Jackson, Mississippi,
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.600]  to get one black man into school.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.040]  He sent fewer in Vietnam.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.080]  They weren't allowed to fight.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.600]  Many of them did.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.759]  They violated the rules of engagement.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.279]  In October of 1963,
[01:03:20.279 --> 01:03:24.680]  he heard that some of his green berets
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.640]  had been killed over there.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.200]  And he said,
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.759]  I want a total casualty list from Vietnam.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.640]  And his aide came to him and said,
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.320]  75 Americans have died.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.800]  He said, that's too many.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.040]  And he signed that day
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.400]  a national security order
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.080]  ordering all troops out of Vietnam,
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:41.800]  U.S. troops.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.080]  The first thousand over the next month
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.880]  and then the rest by the beginning of 1965.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.680]  And then a month later,
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.240]  he was killed.
[01:03:54.279 --> 01:03:55.480]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.480]  This is historic stuff coming out
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.240]  and there's nothing the system
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.040]  can do to stop it.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:00.920]  They try to shut me down.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.880]  Joe Rogan pops up,
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.759]  try to shut that down.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.800]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.120]  The freedom is incredibly popular.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:09.800]  And so it doesn't matter
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.400]  whether Elon Musk is for real or not.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:12.840]  The point is,
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.440]  he's now saying he's one of us
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.800]  because it's so popular
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.240]  and the worm is turning.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.120]  So I want to salute
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.560]  listeners and viewers out there
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.600]  for what you've done over the Earth
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.400]  because without you,
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.080]  none of this would be happening.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.759]  We wouldn't have a good shot
[01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:27.880]  at stopping these people.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.600]  So again, I thank you
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.400]  from the bottom of my heart
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.440]  and I thank you
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.240]  for keeping us on air
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:31.560]  and I thank you
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.440]  for sharing the articles,
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.880]  the videos and the clips
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.720]  because you are changing the world.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.600]  Now, some stages
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.640]  don't carry this five minutes.
[01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:38.840]  When we come back,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.720]  I want to finish up
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.320]  what I covered last hour.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.360]  The rest of the story
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.080]  on the chemicals
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.840]  in the food and water and the air
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.759]  and how it's designed to sterilize us
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.279]  and how we can stop them.
[01:04:48.279 --> 01:04:49.080]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.520]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.

[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.480]  Share that link and ban our video.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.400]  acid, still highly toxic,
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.520]  but containable.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:21.640]  Now these companies
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.800]  had a stockpile of this poison
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.240]  and there was no affordable way
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.360]  to dispose of it.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.320]  Lucky for them,
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.920]  one of their major stockholders
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.440]  was also the secretary
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.320]  of the Treasury,
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.520]  who was responsible
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.880]  for the public health service
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.759]  at the time.
[01:05:34.759 --> 01:05:36.120]  And by 1950,
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.320]  the U.S. government
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.000]  began buying this toxic,
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.480]  untreated industrial waste product
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.200]  and dumping it
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.720]  into our drinking water.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.160]  Reputable studies show
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.400]  that it's causing various cancers
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.920]  and other disease.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.680]  With the Alexa Peer Pro,
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.600]  you can have clean drinking water
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.520]  and a remedy to this madness.

[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.600]  It's Alex Jones
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.600]  coming to you live
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.800]  from the front lines
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.920]  of the Infowars.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.320]  All right,
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.560]  it's hour number two
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.000]  on this Sunday night transmission.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.480]  Thank you so much
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.160]  for joining us on Father's Day.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.160]  Remember,
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.680]  all over the Western world,
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.560]  they're trying to ban,
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.200]  they have banned,
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.160]  the word mother and father
[01:06:32.279 --> 01:06:33.480]  on medical records
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.600]  for children being born
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.640]  and things like that.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.080]  This is a sick, evil cult.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.120]  They're attacking our very biology
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.320]  to depopulate us
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.240]  and take full control
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.440]  of the survivors.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.320]  Now, at the end of the last hour,
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.680]  we heard a very important report
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.960]  where I think he does the best job
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.400]  in just 16 minutes or so,
[01:06:52.279 --> 01:06:53.480]  laying out the history
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.640]  of just bisphenol A
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.720]  and atrazine in the water alone,
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.640]  causing the feminization of men
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.560]  and then causing
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.800]  the hyper feminization of women,
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.240]  which also accelerates them
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.600]  going into puberty early
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.120]  and getting cancer and dying
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.400]  and going into menopause early.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.800]  So all of this accelerates your aging.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.240]  All of it causes premature,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.600]  aging and going to puberty early.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.120]  It's a very serious situation.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.880]  We've covered a lot of the stories
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.080]  or all the stories pretty much
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.360]  that Mark covers,
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.960]  but he does a great job
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.800]  at condensing it all down,
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.560]  which we need to do more of
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.160]  and go back to the core research,
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:31.880]  the core stuff.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.920]  But that's what he's trained
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.680]  as a journalist and media analyst.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.040]  That's what he actually went to college for.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.920]  That's why he does a great job,
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.960]  I guess, doing it.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.720]  Me, I'm a totally lay person at it
[01:07:40.759 --> 01:07:42.120]  and always trying to get Mark on the show,
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:42.600]  but he's like,
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.279]  hey, you got the reports.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.040]  I really like to do it
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.000]  succinctly in the reports,
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.560]  and he does.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.920]  Nobody does it better.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.960]  Shall we put that report out?
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.920]  We'll put back on screen.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.840]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.400]  Hope you share it.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.920]  Mark Dice, Alex Jones was right.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.360]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.640]  makes stunning revelation
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.920]  that will rock the media.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.840]  Now, this isn't about
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.440]  Alex Jones making a stunning revelation
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.640]  or Kennedy making a stunning revelation
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.920]  that will rock the media.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.120]  That's a nice tagline.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.400]  It's a nice hook and it's true,
[01:08:10.279 --> 01:08:11.400]  but it's bigger than Alex Jones
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.520]  or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.080]  and it's on Infowars.com
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.520]  and it's vital you share it.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.880]  When I started to cover in this
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.160]  15, 16 years ago,
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.360]  suddenly I'd have CNN attacking me,
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.480]  Fox News attacking me.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.000]  Jones is crazy.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:25.960]  He says there's chemicals
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.000]  in the food and water
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.600]  that are lowering your fertility
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.800]  and making men feminine.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.040]  I was reading MIT reports.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.160]  I was reading Berkeley reports.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.120]  I was reading all of the actual
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.440]  science and information,
[01:08:39.639 --> 01:08:41.080]  but they would just take a little clip
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:41.960]  where I'd say, listen,
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.639]  this article saying I'm anti-gay
[01:08:45.639 --> 01:08:47.000]  or whatever is not accurate.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.120]  That's what I said in the full
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.480]  famous gay frog clip.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.040]  They cut it out.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.440]  This is a chemical so bad
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.719]  it's literally causing the frogs
[01:08:53.719 --> 01:08:55.080]  to become sterile and die
[01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:57.160]  and literally makes the male frogs
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.360]  want to have sex with male frogs.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.040]  That means their species dies.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.160]  So I'm trying to get them
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.840]  to take out the chemicals in the water
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.600]  that are making the freaking frogs gay
[01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:07.000]  and then I hit a big stack
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.680]  of the articles and papers on the desk.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.680]  Well, they wanted to get ahead of that
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.960]  and make fun of it
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.719]  and that's what they've done the whole time,
[01:09:13.719 --> 01:09:15.160]  but it's really boomeranged on them.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.880]  So there's a lot of pushback against this,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.559]  but it's not just these two chemicals.
[01:09:19.559 --> 01:09:21.080]  There are hundreds,
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.800]  hundreds and hundreds of these
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.160]  that are in the water table
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.840]  even in well water in most areas
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.520]  but particularly tap water
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.880]  and it is just a soup
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.719]  that we're swimming in.
[01:09:31.719 --> 01:09:32.520]  But I got to tell you
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.480]  this report that I covered last hour
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.240]  DICE really knocks it out of the park
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.280]  and explains in separate medical journals
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.080]  they admit,
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.440]  well, men that start going
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.760]  into transgender treatment to become women,
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.880]  which they don't really become women
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.080]  but they think they are,
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.600]  they on average become attracted to men.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.040]  So a lot of people with gender dysphoria
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.080]  who want to become a woman
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.559]  aren't actually attracted to men,
[01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:57.800]  but when they take the hormones they do.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.920]  But then if you say that about people
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.520]  that have gotten birth defects
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.040]  literally in their brain cells,
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.639]  the studies show that
[01:10:05.639 --> 01:10:07.320]  from atrazine and bistroenol A.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.160]  Oh no, no, it's a gift.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.200]  Remember what David Hogg,
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.320]  the anti-gunner said about me.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.320]  He goes, Jones is this con artist.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.719]  He sells water filters on the air
[01:10:15.719 --> 01:10:16.840]  saying you need to filter your water.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.880]  It's full of chemicals.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.160]  Yeah, I sell things you need
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.040]  so we stay on air
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:20.920]  and get the truth out
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.040]  and you get a good product.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.320]  Our filters are the highest rated
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.760]  for the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.240]  But of course,
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:25.880]  I'm just telling you
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.840]  the water is full of crap
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.880]  because it is.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.520]  It's like selling, you know,
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.360]  people when winter is coming
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.080]  and you go to the mall
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.920]  and they got coats out for sale.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.280]  Well, look, you're selling coats
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.559]  right before winter starts.
[01:10:37.559 --> 01:10:38.920]  What type of weirdo are you
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.520]  or summer is about to start?
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.960]  Oh, the swimsuits club.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.480]  That's Dillard's is crazy.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.440]  They sell swimsuits in the spring.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.400]  They're trying to sell swimsuits
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.000]  like you might need one in the summer
[01:10:51.559 --> 01:10:54.120]  or they're trying to sell people
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.480]  gasoline for their car's engines.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.680]  I mean, that's really weird.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.120]  So they're trying to demonize
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.680]  the normalcy of me saying,
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.520]  hey, we have Alexa pure
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.440]  water filtration systems, highest rated.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.559]  They are half the price
[01:11:05.559 --> 01:11:06.840]  of leading competitor.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.840]  Some competitors are three times more.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.200]  And there's four or five companies
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.000]  that have the highest rated.
[01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:12.600]  There's a bunch that don't,
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.320]  but it's the best.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.520]  And it funds the operation
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.960]  in Fort Worth.com.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.680]  So, yes, I'm trying
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.480]  to sell you filters.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.840]  We have money to stay on here.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.280]  And at the same time,
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.719]  explain to you how real this is
[01:11:21.719 --> 01:11:22.920]  and how they make jokes about it.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.800]  So the only place that Kennedy,
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.639]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:11:27.639 --> 01:11:29.880]  and others don't go all the way
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.559]  is this is premeditated.
[01:11:31.559 --> 01:11:32.360]  If you get deeper
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.040]  into Bertrand Russell in the 50s
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.200]  and Aldous Huxley in the 30s
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.120]  and Julian Huxley, his brother,
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.080]  heading up the U.N.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.600]  operation at UNESCO.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.200]  They said, we'll use diet
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.480]  injections and injunctions
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.480]  to control people
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.360]  and make them infertile
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.240]  and make them stupid.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.160]  And that's an eco science.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.440]  It's in there on the conference room table.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.320]  Bring it to me, please.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320]  1974 year I was born published.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.280]  The man later became,
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:54.840]  the wrote the book,
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.160]  the head science are for Obama.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.000]  Paul Ehrlich, John P.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.920]  Holdren, and then his wife,
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.360]  Holdren as well, or no,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.680]  Ehrlich's wife.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.160]  So the point is it says in there,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.680]  we need to put chemicals in the water
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.280]  to sterilize and lower fertility.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.000]  So and I go on and on and on.
[01:12:13.639 --> 01:12:14.280]  So let me just show you
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.480]  some anecdotal evidence here.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.800]  Look, childhood vaccines.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.840]  Again, 1983,
[01:12:19.719 --> 01:12:20.920]  10 vaccines kids were given.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.639]  19, 2013, 32 vaccines,
[01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.800]  20, 22, 74 vaccines.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.080]  And you see right next to it,
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.760]  autism rates explode
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.880]  as the shots go up.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.440]  But it's an exacerbation
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.880]  with all the pesticides
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.760]  and electromagnetics and the GMO
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.360]  and all the things
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.160]  that are happening to us.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.920]  But yes, it is an agenda
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.200]  to sterilize us
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.360]  and they tell us it's an agenda.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.960]  This book is free online.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.160]  You can find the digital copy.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.840]  Once I promoted it
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.040]  and talked about it 15 years ago,
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.000]  it went from being like $5
[01:12:51.559 --> 01:12:53.400]  to buy a hard copy to thousands.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:53.800]  You can buy,
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.600]  I think last time I checked,
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.040]  they were like $2,000 a piece.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:56.840]  But here it all is,
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.719]  how to put stuff in the water
[01:12:57.719 --> 01:12:58.760]  to sterilize you and your family.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.840]  Ecosystems, population,
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.440]  resources, and environment.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.880]  So we bring the documents,
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.480]  but oh, here's the Washington Post.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.480]  Kids are cute,
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.880]  but they're not really eco-friendly.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.559]  One last baby helps the planet
[01:13:13.559 --> 01:13:15.080]  more than giving up meat or car.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.559]  Your meat, everything.
[01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:18.840]  Carbon's not bad.
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.120]  Your babies are carbon.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.320]  And they're being honest now.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.000]  They want to get rid of the carbon.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.360]  That's what this is all about.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:26.920]  And that's why they're
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.280]  sexualizing children.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.719]  That's why they're at all the events.
[01:13:29.719 --> 01:13:30.920]  That's why they're telling them
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.520]  that they need to be sterilized
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.280]  and they need to take hormone blockers,
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.639]  which do sterilize you.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.880]  This is all an agenda
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.480]  to depopulate on record.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.080]  And I show the documents
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.120]  in my film,
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.120]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement,
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.559]  and in-game 1.5.
[01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:46.840]  Because I was going to put out in-game 2.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.240]  Never did.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.200]  So I put out a little addendum.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.040]  It's just on the subject
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.480]  of chemical sterilization
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.320]  from 1960s and 70s,
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.440]  Pentagon documents.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.200]  And make no mistake,
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.400]  it's the people that run the Pentagon
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.600]  that are behind all this.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.520]  Look up Pentagon gay bomb.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.880]  The media always makes a joke about it.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.040]  You've seen it on HBO and CNN
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.559]  and all the late night shows.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.040]  Steve Colbert and all of them.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.000]  They never show me
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.440]  than showing you the article
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.520]  BBC Associated Press.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.040]  Pentagon wanted to spray chemicals
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.400]  on enemy water supplies
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.120]  that literally totally confuse men
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:20.920]  and make them feminine.
[01:14:21.719 --> 01:14:23.080]  So that's how real
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:25.960]  all of this is.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.400]  Now I want to shift gears
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.760]  and talk about dictatorship.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.000]  I want to talk about the fact
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.200]  that Biden's a puppet,
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.480]  but it's an oligarchy
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.480]  of bureaucrats and corporate interests
[01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:36.920]  and intelligence agencies
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.840]  that control Joe Biden.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.240]  Tucker dropped his fourth installment.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.360]  Yeah, there's Wikipedia
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.559]  on the gay bomb,
[01:14:43.559 --> 01:14:45.320]  the Pentagon gay bomb plans.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.320]  And it's a whole project of this,
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.200]  but they'd actually
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.880]  launched it on the public.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.240]  Then they make it cool
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.760]  when, hey, genital sizes
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:53.320]  are a fair,
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.360]  but they were 50 years ago
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.240]  for black and white.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.719]  And oh, you're sterile.
[01:14:57.719 --> 01:14:59.000]  90% sperm reduction.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:14:59.559]  It's liberal.
[01:14:59.559 --> 01:15:00.520]  It's trendy.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.480]  Oh, you're also getting cancer
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.120]  when you're 25
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.960]  and neurological disorders at 25.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.760]  But it's OK.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.400]  Death is cool.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.200]  Death is liberal.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:06.840]  Death is fun.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.480]  We love death.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.200]  We love death.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.800]  But here's Tucker Carlson's
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.400]  fourth historic installment.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.520]  News Corp is starting to sue
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.480]  if he doesn't shut up.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.520]  He has free speech.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.639]  He's totally backed.
[01:15:15.639 --> 01:15:16.760]  It's a toothless attack.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.200]  And then we'll go to this
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.480]  incredibly powerful report
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.000]  pointing out that we do
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:21.960]  have a dictatorship
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.160]  through the puppet.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:23.800]  Oh, Biden.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.719]  And that we don't
[01:15:25.719 --> 01:15:26.680]  turn back against this.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.400]  We have no hope.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.840]  But if we wake up to it
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.200]  and legitimately reject it,
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.240]  that it's not Trump,
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.200]  it's not the Patriots,
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.160]  not the libertarian movement.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.120]  It's not the conservatives,
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.000]  not the populists
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.040]  that want martial law.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:36.760]  It's the left
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.559]  that are setting it up.
[01:15:37.559 --> 01:15:38.760]  They're the ones banning speech.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.880]  They're the ones banning books.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:40.440]  We're just saying
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.480]  don't give pornographic
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.160]  pedophile books to eight-year-olds.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.280]  That's not banning books.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.719]  We're saying don't give it to children.
[01:15:45.719 --> 01:15:47.240]  So here he is breaking down
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.760]  the real dictatorship
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.040]  of the globalist being established,
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.480]  not just here, but worldwide.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.760]  Then we'll be right back after the break.
[01:15:53.639 --> 01:15:55.240]  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.440]  On Tuesday afternoon,
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.719]  the Biden administration
[01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:59.400]  had Donald Trump arrested.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.600]  It was a pretty big news story.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.480]  You may have seen it.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.800]  Just before 9 p.m. that night,
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.160]  as part of its coverage,
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.960]  Fox News ran two live video feeds
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.320]  next to one another.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.040]  On the right,
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.160]  Donald Trump addressed
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.080]  his supporters in New Jersey.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:13.800]  On the left,
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.320]  Joe Biden spoke at an event
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.440]  for the secretary general
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.719]  of NATO in Washington.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.480]  Beneath those videos
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.600]  at the bottom of the screen,
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.280]  Fox's banner read this way,
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:22.920]  quote,
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.440]  wannabe dictator speaks
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.240]  at the White House
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.480]  after having his political rival arrested.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:28.760]  Those words are up
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.960]  for less than 30 seconds,
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.880]  but the effect was immediate.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.320]  Inside Fox,
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.559]  the women who run the network panicked.
[01:16:35.559 --> 01:16:37.000]  First, they scolded the producer
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.680]  who put the banner on the screen.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.200]  Less than 24 hours after that,
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.480]  he resigned.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.240]  He'd been at Fox for more than a decade.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.360]  He was considered one of the most
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.280]  capable people in the building.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.240]  He offered to stay
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.000]  for the customary two weeks,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.760]  but Fox told him to clear out his desk
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.800]  and leave immediately.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.559]  Then the company issued
[01:16:53.559 --> 01:16:54.920]  a public apology
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.680]  for the 27-second-long
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.120]  wannabe dictator line.
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:58.680]  Quote,
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.000]  the chiron was taken down immediately,
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Fox's PR department said.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.360]  And then added ominously,
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.320]  it was, quote,
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:05.960]  addressed.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.559]  That was all true.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.559]  But it was not enough
[01:17:09.559 --> 01:17:11.160]  to save Fox News
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.520]  from the ensuing scandal.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.080]  For a time in the rest of the media,
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.400]  Fox's assessment of Donald Trump's arrest
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.760]  seemed to overshadow
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.960]  Trump's arrest itself.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.920]  Suggesting that Biden is a dictator,
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.200]  declared the Washington Post,
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:24.760]  quote,
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:25.639]  cross the line.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.000]  Alexander Vindman agreed strongly.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.559]  Vindman is the perennial MSNBC guest
[01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:33.400]  and full-time Ukraine promoter
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.920]  you may remember from Russiagate.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.040]  On Twitter,
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.719]  he demanded that the Pentagon
[01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:38.600]  pull Fox News
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.040]  from all military bases.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.240]  It is, quote,
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.760]  absolutely unacceptable
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.360]  for American Forces Network
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.719]  to carry programming
[01:17:45.719 --> 01:17:47.559]  that directly, spuriously,
[01:17:47.559 --> 01:17:48.920]  attacks the commander in chief
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.520]  of American Armed Forces,
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.240]  Vindman wrote.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:52.760]  In other words,
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.040]  Joe Biden must ban
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.639]  all criticism of himself
[01:17:55.639 --> 01:17:56.360]  because that's what
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.400]  non-dictators do.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.960]  John Cusack went further still.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.920]  For the crime of calling Biden a dictator,
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.680]  Fox should be shut down,
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.080]  wrote the 80s era movie star.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:07.320]  Quote,
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.520]  the government has to take away
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.960]  their broadcasting license.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.080]  And so on.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.120]  It was all over the internet.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.520]  Democrats were very, very angry.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.760]  But why were they angry?
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.040]  If the banner on Fox was false,
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.639]  why the hysteria?
[01:18:21.639 --> 01:18:24.600]  Lies don't seem to bother anyone anymore.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.200]  If some cable news producer
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.040]  had called Joe Biden a genius,
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.760]  or accused of being secretly Sudanese,
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.120]  would anyone be yelling about it?
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.520]  Would Fox News have apologized for it?
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:35.960]  Probably not.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.960]  But calling Joe Biden
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.800]  a wannabe dictator,
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.680]  that stung.
[01:18:41.719 --> 01:18:42.680]  So you've got to wonder,
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.440]  if you're being honest with yourself,
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.440]  is Joe Biden a wannabe dictator?
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.440]  That question came up yesterday
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.800]  at the White House briefing.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.520]  Here's how it went.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.480]  So there are probably
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.960]  about 787 million things
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.160]  that I can say about this.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.320]  That was wrong
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.719]  about what we saw last night,
[01:19:07.719 --> 01:19:08.440]  but I don't think
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.480]  I'm going to get into it.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.000]  There's no comment on White House.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.120]  I think I just commented.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.480]  Oh, no comment necessary.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.440]  Of course, Joe Biden's
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.040]  not a wannabe dictator.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.880]  Just because he's trying to
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.559]  put the other candidate in prison
[01:19:21.559 --> 01:19:22.520]  for the rest of his life
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.680]  for a crime he himself committed,
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.559]  doesn't mean he has
[01:19:25.559 --> 01:19:27.000]  a totalitarian impulse.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.200]  Come on, that's absurd.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.120]  It takes a lot more
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.719]  than jailing your political rivals
[01:19:31.719 --> 01:19:32.840]  to earn the title
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.040]  wannabe dictator.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.559]  That's the consensus
[01:19:35.559 --> 01:19:36.600]  in Washington tonight.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.040]  And in some ways,
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:38.600]  for once,
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.280]  the consensus may be right.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.639]  It is not a small thing
[01:19:41.639 --> 01:19:43.240]  to be a wannabe dictator.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.680]  It's quite a process.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.719]  There are a lot of steps.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.520]  First off, there is the money.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.320]  The one thing that
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.240]  all dictators have in common is
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.760]  they enrich themselves
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.200]  and their families,
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:54.920]  their tribe,
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.080]  even as the countries they govern
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.360]  grow steadily poorer
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.240]  and more desperate.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.719]  They take kickbacks from businesses
[01:20:01.719 --> 01:20:03.240]  and from other dictators.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.760]  They use the official functions
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.480]  of their government
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.639]  to funnel cash to themselves.
[01:20:07.639 --> 01:20:08.360]  They don't bother
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.120]  to hide the fruits of this.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.719]  They live in garish mansions
[01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:13.160]  with big lawns
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.000]  far from the teeming cities,
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.520]  even as their own citizens
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.040]  languish in growing poverty,
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.080]  in some cases,
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.040]  literally living
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.880]  in tents on the street.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.840]  So they don't really hide it.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.280]  It's all pretty blatant.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.040]  And ordinary people resent it.
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.559]  Of course they do.
[01:20:27.559 --> 01:20:28.600]  And wannabe dictators
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.880]  know they resent it,
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.760]  but they don't care.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.000]  There's nothing the population
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:33.960]  can do about it
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:34.840]  in a dictatorship.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.040]  It's no longer possible
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.160]  to fight injustice
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.040]  in a system like that.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.559]  People can't gather
[01:20:39.559 --> 01:20:40.280]  in large numbers
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.240]  to protest the rule
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.520]  of the dictator.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.320]  If they try that,
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.360]  they'll be arrested
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.200]  by his state security services
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.880]  even years after the fact.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.280]  A visit for men in body armor
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.719]  at the breakfast table.
[01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:52.440]  That happens.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.960]  And if citizens
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.240]  persist in believing
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.040]  they can gather
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.320]  in groups to protest,
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.600]  they may be shot to death,
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.800]  a bullet to the throat.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.320]  And then,
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:01.719]  just to make
[01:21:01.719 --> 01:21:02.920]  the humiliation complete,
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.040]  to make the lesson
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:04.840]  gin clear
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.520]  to everyone else watching,
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.400]  their relatives
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.120]  can be arrested
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.400]  for daring to complain
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.120]  that their children
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.639]  were killed for complaining.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.680]  Happens in some places.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.000]  Ask Ashley Babbitt's mother.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.120]  Here she is in handcuffs.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:23.400]  You ordered her
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.520]  inside the Capitol,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.559]  now you're going to arrest her?
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.080]  So don't be like
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.280]  Ashley Babbitt's mother,
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.320]  much less like
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.840]  poor Ashley Babbitt.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.719]  She's dead now.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.320]  That's the message
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.520]  a wannabe dictator
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.160]  would send.
[01:21:43.719 --> 01:21:44.200]  And by the way,
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.639]  it's not just public protest
[01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:46.360]  that would be banned
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.880]  in a dictatorship.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.760]  You wouldn't be allowed
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:49.480]  to complain
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.360]  from your own home.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.120]  Unauthorized opinions
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.080]  expressed on the internet
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:53.880]  would be censored.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.080]  Go too far,
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:55.880]  press too deep,
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.559]  tell too much truth,
[01:21:57.559 --> 01:21:58.040]  and they'll just
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.400]  erase your opinions.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.080]  They have no choice really.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:01.639]  It's a matter,
[01:22:01.639 --> 01:22:02.200]  as they say,
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.880]  of trust and safety.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.160]  You must trust the leader
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:05.800]  or else you will
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.000]  jeopardize his safety.
[01:22:07.639 --> 01:22:08.440]  Not that you really
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.400]  can jeopardize
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.760]  his safety at this point.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.400]  The leader has
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.360]  nuclear weapons
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.320]  and you don't.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.280]  He'll remind you of that
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.559]  from time to time.
[01:22:15.559 --> 01:22:16.440]  And in any case,
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.320]  you're in the process
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.520]  of being disarmed anyway,
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.559]  along with everyone else
[01:22:19.559 --> 01:22:20.840]  who has shown questionable
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.040]  loyalty to the leader.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.120]  Those who support the regime
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.240]  can keep their weapons
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.440]  and use them freely,
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.000]  including on
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.360]  public transportation.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.080]  That's a core
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.040]  civil right for them.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.400]  But for those who
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.760]  dissent from the program,
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.639]  self-defense is
[01:22:33.639 --> 01:22:35.480]  an unaffordable privilege.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.520]  Turn in your guns,
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.240]  Mr. and Mrs.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.360]  Peaceful Opposition.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.880]  You're a danger to society
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.920]  and we know who you are.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.440]  And in fact,
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.639]  the wannabe dictator
[01:22:43.639 --> 01:22:44.600]  does know who they are
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.360]  because he knows everything.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.639]  Technology has made him
[01:22:47.639 --> 01:22:48.280]  all-seeing.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.680]  A report in Wired magazine
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.880]  just this week revealed
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.800]  that the highly non-dictatorial
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.080]  Biden administration
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.680]  is busy tracking the phones
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.360]  of millions of Americans
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.400]  without their knowledge
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.200]  and without bothering
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.480]  to get a warrant.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.440]  And at the same time,
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.800]  the same non-dictatorial
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.719]  administration is stockpiling
[01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:07.000]  a massive trove of
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.120]  damaging information
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.639]  about these same Americans.
[01:23:09.639 --> 01:23:10.760]  To be used at some point,
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.040]  we are sure for
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.400]  entirely noble purposes.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.240]  So the administration
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.600]  now knows everything.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.960]  Where you spend your days,
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.000]  who you talk to,
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:19.960]  what you think,
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.920]  your porn habits.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.280]  Not a big deal.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.120]  The administration already
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.080]  knows what you buy,
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:25.559]  of course,
[01:23:25.559 --> 01:23:26.280]  because they've leaned
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.000]  on the big banks
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:27.719]  to turn over your
[01:23:27.719 --> 01:23:30.120]  confidential credit card information.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.480]  Not because anyone here
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.680]  is a wannabe dictator,
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.320]  to be clear,
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.200]  but just because.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:35.639]  It's nice to have
[01:23:35.639 --> 01:23:36.600]  that information.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.240]  Just in case,
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:37.960]  in the words of the
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.480]  Fox News PR department,
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.760]  a situation arises
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:41.400]  that needs to be
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.760]  addressed.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.719]  It's all totally normal.
[01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:45.000]  It's not a dictatorship.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:45.320]  Okay?
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.240]  But in the end,
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.680]  the main reason you know
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:49.639]  Joe Biden is not
[01:23:49.639 --> 01:23:50.840]  a wannabe dictator
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.800]  is because he just
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.880]  does not fit the profile
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.520]  as a man.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.680]  Dictators have that look.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.480]  You know one
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.600]  when you've seen one.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.120]  Dictators build
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.240]  cults of personality
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.120]  around themselves,
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.639]  and they use those cults
[01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:05.320]  to deny the glaringly obvious.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.160]  In his later years,
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.680]  named just one example,
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.800]  North Korean dictator
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.920]  Kim Il-sung developed
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.800]  an enormous
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.320]  baseball-sized tumor
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.360]  on the back of his neck.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:15.880]  It was huge.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.680]  It was grotesque.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.480]  It was right there.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.520]  You couldn't ignore it.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.719]  You couldn't possibly
[01:24:19.719 --> 01:24:20.440]  not see it.
[01:24:21.639 --> 01:24:22.520]  But in North Korea,
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.880]  state media did ignore it.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.480]  They pretended it didn't exist.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.200]  And so,
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.719]  in some important sense,
[01:24:27.719 --> 01:24:28.200]  it didn't.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.440]  If a tumor grows on a neck,
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.639]  but no one acknowledges it,
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.080]  is it really there?
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.080]  Thankfully,
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:35.880]  nothing like that
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.000]  is happening in our country
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.040]  or ever will.
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:38.680]  If Joe Biden
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.440]  ever developed some profound
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.800]  physical or medical problem
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.639]  that was obvious to everybody,
[01:24:43.639 --> 01:24:45.080]  journalists would say something.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.280]  This is not North Korea.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.880]  We don't have state media here.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.880]  If Joe Biden was, say,
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.760]  incapable of
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.040]  completing a full sentence,
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.559]  or mistook his sister
[01:24:53.559 --> 01:24:54.520]  for his wife,
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.880]  or suddenly started
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.080]  falling down in public
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.280]  for no reason,
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.000]  the New York Times
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.120]  would report on that,
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.160]  and they'd get to the bottom
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.600]  of what was actually happening.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.440]  That would be its duty
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.880]  in a free country like ours.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.520]  It's not like they would
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.160]  cover it up.
[01:25:07.719 --> 01:25:09.240]  The very idea of a cover-up
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.600]  sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.800]  A dangerous one, actually.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.520]  So stop it.
[01:25:13.719 --> 01:25:14.280]  And by the way,
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.160]  if Joe Biden
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.200]  was a wannabe dictator,
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.960]  he'd have the family to match.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.920]  All dictators do.
[01:25:19.559 --> 01:25:22.040]  Saddam Hussein had Uday and Qusay.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:22.920]  They were princelings
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.520]  who lived above the law,
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.680]  indulging their most decadent fantasies
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.200]  with total confidence.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.320]  They would be never
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.840]  held to account by the police.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.920]  As the sons of a dictator,
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:33.559]  they knew they could do
[01:25:33.559 --> 01:25:35.080]  exactly what they wanted.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.120]  And so that's what they did.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.480]  There's no one like that
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.280]  around Joe Biden.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.600]  He doesn't have weird sex scandals
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.960]  at the heart of his family
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.840]  that no one in the media
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.200]  will ever talk about.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.480]  He doesn't have a ne'er-do-well
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.920]  former nightclub-owning brother
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.360]  who's made a living for 30 years
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.400]  by being related to him.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.360]  Not at all.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.480]  That's dictator stuff.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.480]  Joe Biden doesn't award
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.000]  ridiculous inflated titles
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:55.800]  to his relatives
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.600]  that the media are then
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.280]  required to take seriously.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.240]  He doesn't call people
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.480]  doctor who didn't go to medical school
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.000]  and then force you to nod along
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:03.559]  like it's real
[01:26:03.559 --> 01:26:04.680]  when everyone knows it isn't.
[01:26:05.559 --> 01:26:06.920]  Nikolai Ceausescu did that
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.200]  with his wife Elena.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.400]  Joe Biden would never do that.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.080]  Nor does Joe Biden
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.360]  dress like a dictator.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.800]  He doesn't do photo ops
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.080]  and mirrored sunglasses
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.520]  driving a sports car
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.480]  to convince you that
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.840]  he isn't frail and senile
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.960]  but instead powerful,
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.240]  virile and wise.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.360]  That's just not his style.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.120]  If Joe Biden was a dictator
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.400]  he'd be wearing epaulettes
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.480]  and carrying a tasselled riding crop
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.600]  and he isn't yet.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.400]  So calm down.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.639]  If he was a dictator
[01:26:31.639 --> 01:26:32.760]  Biden's speeches would look
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.200]  like Nuremberg rallies.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.040]  A blood-red backdrop,
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.040]  armed soldiers by his side,
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.160]  screaming about crushing
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.360]  his eternal enemies.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.680]  Honestly Biden did come close
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.440]  to that one time last September
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.960]  at his speech in Philadelphia.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.480]  But it wasn't in any sense
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.400]  dictatory. Dictatory.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.240]  It was necessary.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.559]  As MSNBC assures at the time
[01:26:53.559 --> 01:26:55.719]  Biden aimed to showcase his faith
[01:26:55.719 --> 01:26:57.160]  in the military apparatus
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.200]  and its ability to back
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.719]  the democratic order.
[01:26:59.719 --> 01:27:00.840]  See it was about democracy
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.280]  not dictatorship.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.480]  No cause for alarm.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.920]  He is not a dictator.
[01:27:05.639 --> 01:27:07.080]  A dictator would stockpile
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:08.920]  ammunition for his own bureaucrats
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.280]  including his tax collectors.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.680]  He'd redefine the legal code
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.280]  to make disloyalty to the regime
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.880]  the most serious crime.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.320]  He claimed dominion over
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.680]  the most intimate parts
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.960]  of his citizens' lives.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.880]  He defined what attitudes
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.920]  they were allowed to have
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.840]  about sex and religion
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.120]  and how to raise their families.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.880]  He would even,
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.880]  in his final grandiose stage
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.240]  of dictatorship,
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.160]  claim ownership of their children.
[01:27:33.719 --> 01:27:35.000]  And Joe Biden wouldn't do that.
[01:27:35.559 --> 01:27:37.320]  And to prove he would never do that
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.840]  Biden just this week
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.120]  released this video.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.080]  These are our kids.
[01:27:41.719 --> 01:27:42.840]  These are our neighbors.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.600]  Not somebody else's kids.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.880]  They're all our kids.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.559]  And our children are the kite strings
[01:27:47.559 --> 01:27:49.480]  that hold our national ambitions aloft.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.719]  It matters a great deal
[01:27:51.719 --> 01:27:53.639]  how we treat everyone in this country.
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.880]  LGBTQ Americans,
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.840]  especially children,
[01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:58.280]  you're loved,
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:27:59.559]  you're heard,
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.960]  and this administration has your back.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:02.920]  See?
[01:28:03.639 --> 01:28:04.760]  Joe Biden isn't saying
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.360]  your children belong to him
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.040]  like a dictator would.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:08.840]  He's saying something
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.960]  very different from that.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.559]  He's saying America's children are,
[01:28:11.559 --> 01:28:12.840]  quote, our children.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.719]  Not his alone,
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.320]  ours.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.480]  You share your children with Joe Biden
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.760]  evenly right down the middle
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.960]  with alternating weekends.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.840]  You've got joint custody with Joe Biden
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.280]  and you can thank heaven that you do.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.440]  A nation is like a family.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.920]  Every family has a head, a father.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.040]  That's Joe Biden,
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.480]  our nation's father.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.680]  And this, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.040]  is now his fatherland.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.800]  Just don't call it a dictatorship
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.160]  or we'll have to issue a statement
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:37.960]  disavowing you.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.840]  A young pair of people say the news
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:43.880]  is full of wine
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.000]  and Kennedy's motorcade.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.840]  239 people
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.840]  tell the death of Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.200]  There is a war for the future
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.160]  happening right now.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.760]  There is a war that will
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.040]  control my destiny,
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:04.920]  your destiny,
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.040]  our children's destiny.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.000]  And that war
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.440]  is something that we can win
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.040]  but it takes dedication,
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.320]  it takes commitment.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.519]  That's why I ask listeners
[01:29:12.519 --> 01:29:13.400]  respectfully

[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.400]  to go to InfowarStore.

[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.040]  and I thank you.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.800]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.519]  this book,
[01:30:00.519 --> 01:30:02.200]  The Great Reset in the War of the World
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.160]  is a historic book
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.360]  that documents the globalist
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.480]  in their own words
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.920]  plan for our future.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.360]  That is a hellish future.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.640]  Now you'll be always,
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.680]  while they still allow books
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.880]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.400]  be able to get an unsigned copy
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.160]  of The Great Reset in the War of the World
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.360]  at bookstores, Amazon,
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.800]  or InfowarStore.com
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.920]  but you will never be able
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.120]  to get another signed copy
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:20.920]  of the book
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.920]  after the signed copies we got
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.400]  run out
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.760]  and there's about a thousand left
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:25.960]  of them right now.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.920]  So get your copy
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.880]  of The Great Reset
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.080]  and The War of the World
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.320]  a signed copy at InfowarStore.com
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.680]  and there is a mark up there
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.120]  because this is a fundraiser
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.240]  to keep us on the air
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.200]  so you won't just have this
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.400]  historic memento
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.280]  and this powerful book
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.080]  you'll also know
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.040]  that you help keep
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.080]  Infowars on the air.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:42.040]  I want to thank those of you
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.000]  that have gotten signed copies
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:43.320]  of the book
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.000]  or unsigned copies
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:45.880]  but I want to encourage
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.840]  all of you
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.960]  who haven't yet
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.480]  to go to InfowarStore.com
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.680]  and get a signed copy
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.280]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.320]  and donate to the library
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.400]  or give them to the local school.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.440]  This is an Infowar
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.240]  I'm counting on you
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.280]  and thank you for your support.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.320]  You wanted to plug Rainforest
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.120]  do you like Rainforest?
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:01.480]  Yeah so
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.000]  my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.200]  how do I write
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.240]  all the books that I do
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.160]  four books with Dr. Judy Mikovits
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.600]  four books with Project Veritas
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.240]  whistleblowers
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.480]  and now two books with Alex Jones
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.360]  that's because
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.920]  I use brain force every day
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.960]  what I always need
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.160]  is I always need
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.920]  some sort of boost in the morning
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.720]  and so you know
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.000]  I try to exercise
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.040]  eat well
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:22.840]  take good vitamins
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.880]  but the one thing
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.560]  that I have really found
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.160]  that makes a difference
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.360]  is brain force
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.640]  I'll take brain force
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.680]  in the morning
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.519]  right before I go to my computer
[01:31:32.519 --> 01:31:33.720]  and I'm good for the next
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.080]  four or five hours
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.200]  writing a whole lot of stuff
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.960]  so it really is true
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.400]  that brain force is something
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.600]  I use every day
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.200]  and it helps me with my writing
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.000]  all right we love you
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:43.640]  we'll be right back
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.000]  get your brain force plus

[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.240]  we have three original
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.760]  one-of-a-kind toothpaste
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:04.440]  to sign my father a dentist
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.560]  at infowarstore.com
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.600]  that don't have fillers
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.480]  that are filled with
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:09.240]  high quality essential oils
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:10.120]  and more
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.320]  we have the tumeric toothpaste
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.560]  we have the ultimate

[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.560]  with coral calcium toothpaste

[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.360]  activated charcoal toothpaste

[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:20.519]  of key essential oils
[01:32:20.519 --> 01:32:21.240]  that are so good
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.200]  not just for your teeth
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:22.760]  and your gums
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:23.560]  but your whole mouth
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.680]  your throat and more
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.400]  these are really
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.760]  game-changing toothpaste
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.120]  they're very very strong
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.320]  most over-the-counter toothpaste
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.200]  have fluoride
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.240]  ours don't
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.760]  and it doesn't have fillers in it
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.840]  it is just chock full
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.440]  of incredible things
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.480]  that God gave us
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:38.760]  through mother nature
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.680]  so it's now back in stock
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.200]  it became a best seller
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.240]  the tumeric toothpaste
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.200]  is available again
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.560]  at infowarstore.com
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.280]  we're selling out of the
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.160]  tooth white toothpaste
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.200]  we got some of that left
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.320]  and we also have some of the
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.000]  amazing activated charcoal toothpaste
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:51.320]  in stock
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.519]  but it's running out as well
[01:32:52.519 --> 01:32:54.120]  so all three toothpastes in stock
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.000]  for a limited time
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.800]  infowarstore.com
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:18.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:22.900]  We are back live on this Sunday transmission, Owen's going to be live in studio coming up
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:27.900]  in about 30 minutes with Sunday live at mfullwars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:33.940]  Now I was interviewed yesterday by Peter McIlvina, he was a really smart and informative podcaster,
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:34.940]  but he kind of let me run.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.900]  It was about a 40 minute interview.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.660]  We'll link it up on mfullwars.com to see the full thing, but I want to hear about
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.900]  25 minutes of it here in just a moment because he asked me some important questions
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:48.300]  on whatever some important information, but I want to just say this right up front
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.300]  here.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:53.300]  When I first got on here 29 years ago, almost nobody was talking about the New World Order
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.500]  or the specifics of it.
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:01.140]  Now it is extremely mainstream, it's out in the open and we are seeing the biggest acceleration
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:06.180]  awakening ever and the New World Order is scared and it's pulling out all the punches.
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:09.500]  So they are pulling out all the stops.
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:12.580]  That said, at least we're in the fight and I want to commend you all for your support.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:19.660]  But I'm not in competition with Joe Rogan or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Del Bigtree or,
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.460]  you know, any of these people.
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:24.900]  I love what they're doing, I love how hardcore they are because the Globals are
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:31.820]  planning new viral releases, new lockdowns, but so many other talk show hosts are territorial.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:35.020]  People even ask me, like, why are you even showing clips to Tucker Carlson or why
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:37.500]  are you showing Joe Rogan clips or why are you showing this?
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:41.740]  Because they're good people, they're really getting more hardcore, they're really waking
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:46.060]  up, Tucker's completely awake, Joe's about 90% there.
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.300]  And I'd love to just beat this thing and back this evil off, we still have crime and
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:55.220]  some problems and things but not active evil in charge of the corporations and government.
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:58.580]  Wouldn't be openly running the show, we could, you know, mitigate it.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.300]  And so that's really my goal here is to be obsolete.
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:03.820]  The problem is we're far from obsolete.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:08.700]  And whereas a lot of people now understand things I knew 20 years ago and that's hurting
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:12.500]  the Globalist agenda, people need to know the big picture and be able to tie it all
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.900]  together how it's a concerted evil effort.
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:18.020]  And that's where we still come in.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.860]  So we're not obsolete, in fact, we're more important than ever to talk about what's
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:22.860]  coming next.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:27.020]  Yes, everybody can discover we're right about what happened and we predicted it, but we
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.020]  wanted to stop it.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:30.860]  So now I want to stop the rest of their agenda happening.
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:34.860]  We've got a good chance now because people now know I'm not exaggerating, this isn't
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:35.860]  a game.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.940]  People now know the enemy was so upset by us because they knew I had their number and
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:42.940]  integrated all their systems together and really reverse engineered their operations.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:48.740]  So I've done an hour and a half plus here this evening, but have not plugged
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:49.740]  one time.
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:51.700]  So our biggest problem is me.
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:55.920]  I say, hey, only 1% of our listeners buy product, if 2% bought product, we'd be doing
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.320]  great and be able to expand, not just hold the line.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:03.100]  But if I plug two or three times an hour, we always bring in plenty of money.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.380]  I plug once an hour, we break even.
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.060]  I have not done my job tonight.
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.060]  So that's my fault.
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.780]  Listen, you're going to have to step up because I haven't done my job.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:14.060]  If you want to keep us on here, turmeric toothpaste, I didn't think it was a bad
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:16.640]  idea on my day I came up with it, but I thought, well, that's okay.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.140]  I like the tooth whitening toothpaste and you know, the charcoal toothpaste.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:21.340]  That's my idea.
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:24.660]  That's already a best seller, so we just made a better version of it.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:28.780]  This has been the all time best selling toothpaste and it sold out the first two runs.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:30.100]  It finally came back in.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:31.100]  There's no fillers.
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:32.100]  It's full of turmeric.
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:34.940]  So good for your gums, your teeth, your whole body and a bunch of essential oils that are
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.940]  amazing as well.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:40.920]  And it keeps us on here back in stock, your turmeric toothpaste at info war store.com.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:44.020]  And we have the tooth whitening toothpaste that's by the way, selling out.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:49.020]  And we have the charcoal toothpaste, which is popular as well, just not as popular as
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:50.020]  the turmeric.
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:53.100]  So all three are in stock right now, but soon we'll be sold out of the tooth whitening
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.100]  toothpaste.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:58.940]  And we haven't had that in six months, got a small shipment in also super female
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.940]  vitality has come back in.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.100]  It's the same formula.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.980]  Super male male has a blue label.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.540]  Female has a pink label.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:07.620]  People want a different label, but it does the same thing.
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.420]  Libido stamina energy.

[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:16.940]  three one three nine.

[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:05.740]  dropped today.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:10.880]  We'll post the full thing at info wars.com and then Owen Schroyer in 26 minutes is
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.560]  going to be sitting right here in this chair.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.960]  But listen, it's father's day.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.080]  I made the crew come in.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.080]  I came in here.
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:20.880]  I wanted to take my daughter swimming or something, but you know what?
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.880]  I need to nail it.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:22.880]  I need to fight harder.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.880]  We're so close to winning.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.880]  So I'm here.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.440]  I need you to decide, Hey, this is important stuff he's doing.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.420]  Plus he's got some great products.
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:32.040]  So for those, he got the products and liked them and never order them again, please
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.960]  go order them for those that order products and routinely order them.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.020]  I thank you.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:41.600]  And for those that never got the products, I mean, at least go make a donation then
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.840]  at info war store.com, right at the top, $5, $10, you're recurring canceling
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.840]  time.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.840]  The point is we're fighting for you.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.840]  We're in this fight together.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.840]  I need your help.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.160]  You need my help.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.600]  And we are under a major attack.
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.600]  You can see that.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.600]  And I don't care about that.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.200]  I just want to beat these people and I don't just smell blood.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.200]  I got their blood all over me.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.200]  I got their blood in my mouth.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.720]  I use that as an analogy of like an attack dog.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.200]  I mean, I ain't smelling blood.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.560]  I ain't, I'm not, I'm not smelling victory.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.000]  I'm just victory, victory, victory, victory, victory.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.680]  All we do is victory, victory, victory, victory, victory.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:15.520]  It's all God's not me, but I'll never give up.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.520]  I'll never give in.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.520]  I couldn't give out.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.280]  I'm asking you though, energize us, please get products you already need.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.280]  Take the action.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.880]  The whole world's about action.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.680]  Salute those that have taken action.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.280]  Even if you can't buy our products, $12 or $10 toothpaste, I understand that's fine.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.120]  At least for heaven's sake, spread the word about the broadcast and pray for the broadcast
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:37.120]  and I thank you.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.120]  Great job, crew.
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:40.240]  All in coming up in 24 minutes now.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.240]  Here's part of that report.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.880]  You're at hearts of oak.
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.280]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.440]  Thanks for having me.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.720]  Not at all.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.760]  We'll just jump in.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:56.160]  Look, it's been nearly 25 years since you started Infowars and I wonder what moved you?
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:02.000]  What was your assessment of what was the value of the site to actually start something?
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.800]  Well Wikipedia says Infowars started in 1999.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.920]  That's not true.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:11.000]  I got the website in 1997, but it says it was registered in 99.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  That's not right.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  I got on air in a 94 on local access TV as a guest on shows and then I got my own
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:21.720]  show in 95 and got a local radio show in 97.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:27.360]  I got syndicated in 98 and I just, I was aware of what was going on in the world.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.640]  I had read a lot of books about the new world order and globalism because family
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.920]  had given them to me that were informed, so I was kind of fast tracked to know what
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:40.400]  was coming and then I saw what family had warned me about when I was young, actually
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:46.080]  all over the place, so I began to research not just the books written by the John
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:51.200]  Burch Society and people like Barry Goldwater, but I started reading stuff by
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.600]  Anthony Sutton who was the top archivist at Congress.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:58.520]  Then I started actually reading the books he recommended written by the bad guys
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:03.520]  like Georgetown mentor and political science professor, Carol Quigley,
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.920]  who wrote Tragedy and Hope, so when I was about 18, I read that 1100 page book
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.920]  that described the entire way they control the world and how US intelligence
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:19.120]  emerged and British intelligence after World War II.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:22.040]  Now they were establishing a planetary government and what they wanted to do
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  and how they wanted to break up the family and basically create a form of
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.160]  communism for the public, but robber baron fascism at the top for the big
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.160]  corporations and really like the 1970s movie Rollerball where there's a
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.720]  corporate elite that rule the planet and they are above the law and even if
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.600]  you're a champion rollerballer like James Con is, the executive wants his wife
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.840]  just to execute the power and takes her and she has to marry him and there are
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:56.840]  no nation states in the future, there's only megacities which the globalists
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.120]  say they're going to end the nation state and only create these city states
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.880]  like we see with the Vatican or the city of London inside London or Israel.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.680]  That's really the model or what the city of Saudi Arabia, they call
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.680]  it the line, they're setting up several other sovereign cities within Saudi
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.680]  Arabia, so that's really the model where they're all exempt, we're all made
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:24.680]  poor and then a big UN world peace force controls things, we're all
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.680]  disarmed, it's really a dystopic system they're establishing and building.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:32.680]  So I learned about it when I was young, it was kind of background noise,
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.680]  but then by the time I got out of high school and saw it actually
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:41.680]  happening, then I decided to make it my wife's destiny to fight these
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.680]  people and I really innately believe that humanity was betting on humanity, that this was
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:49.680]  the next big authoritarian totalitarian threat to humanity
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:53.680]  but I knew that communism and Nazism have been spin-offs of this very
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:57.680]  group in their own writings and so I really
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:01.680]  felt threatened by it and a sense of destiny
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.680]  that I was going to battle them because I could see what they wrote
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:09.680]  about in the 50s was done by the 70s and what they wrote about in the 70s was completed
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:13.680]  by the 90s and so I was sitting there in the 90s reading their horrible
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.680]  plans for Agenda 2020 which they basically
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:21.680]  almost got done but are a little bit behind, maybe 5-10%
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.680]  behind on, but they basically got most of what they wanted, very ambitious strategy
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:29.680]  by 2020, then I of course saw their Agenda 2030 program
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.680]  that is just absolutely like beyond Hitlerian
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.680]  and you've got the WEF head spokesman saying you're useless eaters quoting
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:41.680]  Hitler, but it's okay because he's Jewish and it's just totally bizarre
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:45.680]  and just the future's not human, cyborgs will rule
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.680]  by 2047, you will eat bugs, you will like it,
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.680]  we won't have cities, we'll have communes by 2030, we're going to depopulate you
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.680]  by 90%, I mean, I
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:01.680]  shudder to think how they're going to try to get their goal by 2030, their program is falling
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.680]  apart, they're behind schedule, but they only accelerate each time they get behind and
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:09.680]  when faced with such a dystopian movement, the average person
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.680]  has a learned helplessness, a normalcy bias, kind of a Stockholm
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:17.680]  syndrome thing where people just go, this can't be real, I just choose to not believe this
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:21.680]  but I will assure you ladies and gentlemen, all you got to do is watch a WEF event
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.680]  or read their transcripts and when you read it, it's so
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:29.680]  diabolical, it's so Lex Luthor that it's hard to fathom it, but it's
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.680]  hard to believe that World War II happened and that
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.680]  25 million Russians died and 24 million Germans died and that
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:41.680]  Hitler ran around and killed tens of millions of people, I mean, it's just, but it happened
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.680]  and we've lived in the West kind of sheltered by the Renaissance
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.680]  and by the fumes of Christianity, but those fumes
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.680]  have now run low and the fires of liberty have gone out and
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.680]  tyranny is exploding again, but historically, once the
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.680]  tyranny explodes and lifts its ugly head, there's always a
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.680]  resistance against it, so we are in a do or die situation right now.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.680]  Well, I watched America Destroyed by Design quite a while
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:13.680]  ago and then had re-watched it and it actually intrigued
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.680]  me that you were calling out the Communist China, you're
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.680]  also calling out the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergs, I mean, how
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.680]  has it taken like a decade after at least for most conservative
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.680]  voices to actually understand that China is a threat and even just
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.680]  recently the Trilateral Commission, which isn't really on anyone's radar?
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:37.680]  Well, you're right, I mean, if you look at the Trilateral Commission and the
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:41.680]  CFR, the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Politburo
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.680]  of China, there's a couple hundred men
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:49.680]  and a few women that run the planet and they're Europeans
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.680]  and they're Asian and there's a few Latin Americans and a few Africans
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.680]  but it's mainly European and
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:01.680]  Asian and they are a eugenics cult and they
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.680]  want a lot of such technology and they do not believe in the public having a
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.680]  future and they're extremely dystopic, I mean, they believe
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.680]  in a dystopic program for humanity, they believe in
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:17.680]  collapsing civilization and then using that reorganization to launch a new
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:21.680]  form of civilization, a technocracy after that
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.680]  and I can see the earliest point, it was a lot of aimless people and there's a lot of resources
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.680]  being used but who puts them in charge of making those decisions and I think the public
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.680]  should be told this is happening to them, that sperm counts are down 90%
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.680]  that they're knowingly allowing industrial chemicals into the food chain
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:41.680]  that do give us cancer and do make us infertile and that they brag about how they did
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.680]  that. So, they put Trojan horses not just in the cell
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.680]  phones to listen to us and track us, they've got Trojan horses in the GMO crops to
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:53.680]  sterilize us and it's not just that it's
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.680]  they're not just neglecting us, they are
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:01.680]  doing this by design. As you talk about the trilateral commission set up by
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.680]  Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller in the mid-1970s
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.680]  it was a super management group
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:13.680]  basically like a finance arm of the Bilderberg
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:17.680]  group, which is the very top, basically the same members
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.680]  to then coordinate the round table groups below them to a better level
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.680]  so absolutely, the trilateral commission
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.680]  is right at the top, but again if you see who's on the
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:33.680]  National Security Council of Countries and you see who's on the UN Security Council and you see who's
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.680]  the heads of the central banks, literally it's a couple hundred people
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.680]  and then on the steering committees it's about 20
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.680]  Campbell wrote the book
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.680]  with a committee of 300, I interviewed him many times, I'm tired today
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:53.680]  and that was the old name of the British East India
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:57.680]  company corporate management, so when I talk about it being a UK
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.680]  based thing, it's not an anglophile or an anglophobe thing
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.680]  it's not the British that run it, it's not even King Charles, it's just that
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.680]  that management system of covert corporate control
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.680]  with interlocking corporate directorates then controlling government militaries
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.680]  is the model and the
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:21.680]  center of the wheel of the management directive and directorate
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.680]  and so that's what it is, it's the British empire merged with the US empire
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.680]  but not to make the empire for
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.680]  freedom or the people, it exploits the people of North America, it exploits the people
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.680]  of the UK, it exploits the people of Australia and Canada and everywhere and it is
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:41.680]  a system that is in competition with the Renaissance
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:45.680]  and with productivity and with Christianity, real Christianity not corporate
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.680]  corporate Christianity and so that's why it's at war and has to bring down the first world
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:53.680]  they're not bringing down the first world to raise the third world
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:57.680]  they're lowering the first world so people never aspire to that again
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.680]  and so the third world goes down, the old world goes down
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.680]  we all collapse on each other and then the city-states will then take
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.680]  under themselves high-tech breakaway civilization
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.680]  that only operates just like the Hunger Games books
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.680]  which again is based on what they really want to build
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.680]  we have these high-tech regions, high-tech systems
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.680]  that everybody else is kept in squalor
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.680]  Well some of the organizations more recently
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:33.680]  the WAF and the WHO, they seem to be blatant
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.680]  in what they want to do, it's not hidden, when you were doing this
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.680]  25 years ago it was hidden, you were exposing what they didn't want to expose
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:45.680]  and now they televised some of the WHO stuff, it is out there
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.680]  and now full movement towards restricting travel
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:53.680]  with vaccine passports in the next year
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:57.680]  How has that moved away from that being blatant and open from being hidden?
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:01.680]  Well that's what's so frustrating about this is
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:05.680]  I was just successful at getting this out to a large audience
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.680]  I certainly did not develop much of the research
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.680]  I've gone out and covered things myself and gotten the latest info
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.680]  but there was a hardcore group of people around the world
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.680]  mainly who worked in military and intelligence who was read into this
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.680]  and decided to say I'm not going to be part of this, like both sides of my family
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.680]  had people that were working in the military and intelligence
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:33.680]  and that's who I first heard about all this from when I was a small child
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:37.680]  and then it was just background noise
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.680]  The fact that I knew about this and then they would deny
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:45.680]  it existed and say I made it all up and Alex Jones is the guy that came up with this
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:49.680]  has been a narrative for many years
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:53.680]  but really what's happening is there comes a point that they have to emerge
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.680]  and so they're building it behind the scaffolding
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:01.680]  you ever seen a big ship get launched, they'll have big doors or a big curtain
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:05.680]  and they're building the ship behind that and then finally the day
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:09.680]  they launch the ship comes and they pull back the giant curtains
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:13.680]  and here's this huge beautiful ship, slides off the blocks into the ocean
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:17.680]  and then they break some champagne on the bow of it
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:21.680]  and so in the last decade really they pulled back the curtain
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:25.680]  showed us the ship and said but it's good
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:29.680]  so we were telling them they're building a ship behind there for tyranny, they're building world government
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:33.680]  they're going to break up the family, they're going to cut the resources off, they're going to take your guns, they're going to feed you GMO
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.680]  5G, they're going to, we're reading all their plans because we're behind the curtain
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.680]  and then they realize at a certain point
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.680]  Toto can pull back the curtain, if they kept denying it while it's out in the open
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:49.680]  that would just give us more credibility, so they passed a Rubicon where they censor
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:53.680]  and attack and demonize those of us that are critical of the global government
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.680]  but at the same time unveil it and roll it out as if it's something good and the answer to all the problems
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:01.680]  that they helped create and so we've gone from the mask being on
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:05.680]  to the emergence, it's kind of like in World War 2, submarines would run out of torpedoes
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:09.680]  really quick but they had their deck gun to sink ships with, so the Germans particularly
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:13.680]  would be out there on a big mission, they already sunk a bunch of ships, already used their 10 torpedoes
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:17.680]  but there's more ships to blow up, more ships to sink, they got to rise up
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:21.680]  and use the deck gun to sink the ships and so that's what they've done is the submarine
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.680]  has emerged and is shooting at us right now and saying it's shooting at us
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.680]  and saying to the intelligent people resist is futile
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:33.680]  you better roll over right now, nobody can stop us, the future's not human
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.680]  you better join us and a lot of people are going whoa this is real, what do I do to get on board
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:41.680]  and then a lot of other people that were asleep just go
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:45.680]  eh, nothing you can do and then those of us that knew we could stop it are saying see we warned you
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:49.680]  but it doesn't take a majority to stop this, if anything
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:53.680]  when you read Yuval Noah Harari who's the high priest of these guys and Ray Kurzweil
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:57.680]  and these guys and Prince Charles
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:01.680]  King Charles now and Klaus Schwab, I mean I've read their books
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:05.680]  I've read their writings, not just their speeches, they are maniacs
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.680]  I mean they are, we are invincible, humans are going to live forever, we're about to be gods
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:13.680]  but first we've got to get rid of the general public and what we're doing is beautiful work and we're so amazing
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.680]  yeah Hitler had his thousand year ride, look how long it lasted
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:21.680]  so they are purposely
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:25.680]  trying to invoke mass Stockholm syndrome in us by pushing this giant
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:29.680]  utopia that really is a dystopia, so
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:33.680]  they're telling us all the dystopia happening is because we haven't submitted their plan
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:37.680]  but you can pull back and see the dystopia is coming from them, they say
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.680]  global warming is why we had the virus, not it came from a lab and more viruses
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:45.680]  are coming because we're in the jungles and oh
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:49.680]  oh my gosh the third world because of global warming is coming
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:53.680]  here not from two years of lockdowns and mass starvation
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:57.680]  and a big international gallop poll of the migrants
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:01.680]  it was 10,000 they did this a few months ago, 97% said we've been locked down
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:05.680]  for years, the farms and ranches are closed, the factories are closed, there's no food
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:09.680]  we have to come here and the UN organized us in our respective countries to come here
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:13.680]  so the UN turns your food off, locks you up, shuts you down and then
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.680]  organizes you to then invade the first world where there are now clients
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:21.680]  of this group that's just been brought in, this has all been battle gamed, war gamed
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:25.680]  and if we just admit it's happening and admit it's going on and stop living in denial
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:29.680]  we can then organize, get control of local governments, then national governments and
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:33.680]  stop this but if we don't it is the design collapse of all the
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.680]  nation states, huge wars, controlled viral releases
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:41.680]  to bring in tyranny, safe zone cities that are self-sufficient and locked down
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.680]  during viral attacks while they're in the cities it's wink wink
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:49.680]  you want to be in the city because you didn't even mean a rural place
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.680]  they're going to fly over with a drone and nerve gas you and say it was the virus
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:57.680]  and I mean I've seen the plans, I've seen somebody classified plans, they reclassified
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.680]  about their drone attack plans, they can fly over with synthetic opiates that kill you dead
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:05.680]  in a hammer, that dissipate in just a week or so
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:09.680]  and so it's only going to be people that are in these compact mega cities
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.680]  that are going to be protected but they themselves are going to be under an authoritarian
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:17.680]  control as well so they're going to panic all the money to run into these
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.680]  compact cities, these city-states while it's road war
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:25.680]  on the outside and the rest of us get wiped out, that's the plan
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.680]  You've said out what we face, in the midst of that
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.680]  you've built something huge and your name
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:37.680]  is far and wide, the only other person I know who does four hours a day is
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:41.680]  Steve Bannon, I mean tell us how you've grown up
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:45.680]  through blood sweat and tears to be the voice of reason
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:49.680]  worldwide that it is now, tell us about that
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:53.680]  Well I mean look, I've been on air since 1994
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.680]  and it was all knowing this was real
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:01.680]  because again they didn't make a big deal about it, they were all very humble, very polite
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:05.680]  people but I just was so blessed to grow up around people that
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:09.680]  my mom's dad, my grandfather
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:13.680]  was a World War II vet and Army Air Corps and then
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:17.680]  worked for oil companies but also worked with some inventors
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:21.680]  on secret weapon projects for the Pentagon
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.680]  and then like I said his son was high level in all this and then
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:29.680]  my dad's other family was like that, so I was just really really really blessed
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:33.680]  and they were patriots and they didn't like the way it was going, so I'm sitting around
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:37.680]  the dinner table, I'm 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:41.680]  by the time I was like 12 or 13 they didn't really talk about the stuff in front of me
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:45.680]  this is all secret stuff they were talking about, they act like kids aren't kids, they're not listening
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.680]  so I was knee high to a grasshopper
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.680]  listening to all this stuff
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.680]  and just being blown away by it
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.680]  and then I kind of became a teenager and chased girls and kind of forgot
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:05.680]  about it and then I went to community college, decided I wanted to go to college and it was all just
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.680]  America's horrible, communism's good, we're going to get your guns, white people are bad
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.680]  and I'm like well this is everything I got warned about, I was like I better do something about this
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:17.680]  and so that was it, and then I just like oh Access TV is the place, because I try to get jobs
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:21.680]  on the radio and they said no and I tried to send in tapes of me doing a show
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:25.680]  I mean this one I'm like 18, 19, and it didn't discourage me
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.680]  and I remember when I was 18 I sent, they were having a contest to hire a new
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:33.680]  talk show, so I ended up hiring Jeff Ward, but
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:37.680]  former NFL kicker, friend of mine now, and I'm
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.680]  18 and, or 19, not just about 18
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.680]  they had a contest that they'd gotten rid of their other talk show hosts, in fact the new company
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:49.680]  bought it, they fired everybody
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:53.680]  Two of our best selling neutropics or brain boosters
