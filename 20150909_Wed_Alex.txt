[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[00:20.960 --> 00:34.960]  jones yesterday I said it'd been too long since Ted Nugent had been on the
[00:34.960 --> 00:39.800]  broadcast and I guess they heard that as his media people called us and said hey
[00:39.800 --> 00:44.360]  he's ready to come on and man the story he's got to tell it just fits into the
[00:44.360 --> 00:49.680]  massive censorship of libertarian and conservative ideas in this country and
[00:49.680 --> 00:54.160]  the reign of terror of political correctness they have decided to go
[00:54.160 --> 00:59.400]  full board I have two articles one from Washington State and one from
[00:59.400 --> 01:03.720]  Washington Pennsylvania strangely enough I noticed that looking at the
[01:03.720 --> 01:11.040]  articles one out of ABC News one out of CBS News the one out of Pittsburgh they
[01:11.040 --> 01:15.240]  sent a political correct operative in there a woman to a barber shop and said
[01:15.240 --> 01:20.200]  do my hair and they said we don't have the equipment to do your hair there's a
[01:20.200 --> 01:25.000]  women's salon down the street so she went to the government they find them
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.120]  and just like the folks that won't bake the cake for the gay people they'll end
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.000]  up in jail if they don't submit to it so he said I I guess I'll get the
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.440]  equipment and the hair rollers and all around I mean barber shops are for men
[01:39.440 --> 01:45.240]  because you want to be in there 10 minutes I've gone to barber shops most
[01:45.240 --> 01:52.640]  my life I want to go in I want to get my hair cut I want to be gone in 15
[01:52.640 --> 02:00.720]  minutes I don't want to get my hair cut over 45 minutes an hour and you've got
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.160]  salons that are for women I mean there are salons where there's nothing but
[02:06.160 --> 02:13.560]  women it has nothing to do with putting women down but that's indicative of the
[02:13.560 --> 02:19.760]  war on just being male when they say we're going to ban the word father or
[02:19.760 --> 02:29.320]  mother boy or girl he or she they mean business and this is the take down of
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.280]  civilization we're witnessing and turning people just against themselves
[02:34.280 --> 02:42.440]  where being married or having children is fundamentally a crime we're having a
[02:42.440 --> 02:50.560]  single family dwelling as a crime under world treaty agenda 21 we're half the
[02:50.560 --> 02:56.800]  roads are turning to robot roads in the next five to ten years and then they're
[02:56.800 --> 02:59.360]  gonna phase them all out that was announced in the LA Times yesterday
[02:59.360 --> 03:07.040]  course I told you this 20 years ago we're here they're making their move to
[03:07.040 --> 03:17.240]  destabilize things and consolidate power I have a stack of news here where they
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.840]  are waging war on the family and our very biology Hillary Clinton says she's
[03:22.840 --> 03:30.680]  sorry about the private email use we're gonna play that clip Trump has come out
[03:30.680 --> 03:36.920]  and said we have to accept migrants here from Syria because they're quote in a
[03:36.920 --> 03:51.160]  hell but nobody else has to not Saudi Arabia not any of these countries and
[03:51.160 --> 03:54.640]  of course he's trying to score politically correct points now that he's
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.960]  the front-runner that's what I've been worried about with Trump is that once he
[03:58.960 --> 04:05.560]  starts getting closer to the election he'll moderate towards the Democrats
[04:05.560 --> 04:12.200]  well if the Democrats want to commit national suicide we you can't moderate
[04:12.200 --> 04:18.400]  dragging a double-edged dagger across your arteries you can't moderate jumping
[04:18.400 --> 04:23.480]  off a thousand-foot cliff without a parachute you can't moderate things
[04:23.480 --> 04:29.600]  like this this is designed to suicide the West and I don't even mean racially
[04:29.600 --> 04:35.840]  it's designed to suicide us with Balkanization Tower of Babel divide and
[04:35.840 --> 04:43.560]  conquer Cloward and Piven bankruptcy so that's all coming up today as well and
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.680]  I saw this on local news yesterday it's now national news who football players
[04:48.680 --> 04:54.320]  in high school spear the referee and then afterwards said it's okay he was
[04:54.320 --> 05:02.560]  racist with no proof over the Labor Day weekend we had reports of eight being
[05:02.560 --> 05:07.760]  killed and 46 being wounded July 4th of this year we had reports of nine dead
[05:07.760 --> 05:13.120]  in 53 wounded and let us not forget July 4th of last year we had reports of
[05:13.120 --> 05:19.040]  14 killed and 82 shot and these are not nationwide stats all of these numbers
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.640]  come from the city of Chicago the city with some of the strictest gun laws in
[05:23.640 --> 05:28.360]  the nation which is to say if criminals expect you to be unarmed they're more
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.080]  likely to attack you not to mention the fact that much of this violence is
[05:32.080 --> 05:36.880]  linked to gangs or drug activity meaning that for all the gun buybacks and
[05:36.880 --> 05:41.520]  anti-gun commercials criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms
[05:41.520 --> 05:46.440]  and I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every
[05:46.440 --> 05:50.520]  place at once but that's why you have a second amendment so you'll be able to
[05:50.520 --> 05:57.360]  protect yourself you can find more reports on info wars.com

[08:40.880 --> 08:45.880]  wars live I'm your host Alex Jones
[08:45.880 --> 08:51.880]  we return weeknight 7 o'clock Central but the info wars nightly news then
[08:51.880 --> 08:58.920]  Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. with the abbreviated live broadcast 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[08:58.920 --> 09:03.800]  World Bank chief economist warns the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve
[09:03.800 --> 09:09.600]  to delay rate rise Peter Schiff says everybody's got it wrong they're not
[09:09.600 --> 09:12.720]  gonna raise the rates he says they're gonna leave them the same I tend to
[09:12.720 --> 09:15.960]  agree with him all the indicators show that especially with China further
[09:15.960 --> 09:22.800]  devaluing their currency and beginning to dump US treasuries upwards of 115
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.960]  billion in the last week that is only going to make the Federal Reserve want
[09:27.960 --> 09:34.440]  to continue to race to devalue you as well in my opinion obviously anything's
[09:34.440 --> 09:39.240]  possible these globalists they throw so many curveballs they could do a mix to
[09:39.240 --> 09:42.840]  they've been talking about giving central banks free money still was 0%
[09:42.840 --> 09:46.720]  interest but then raising it for the public in the prime interest rates so
[09:46.720 --> 09:50.320]  that's probably what you're gonna see in fact we've kind of already seen that
[09:50.320 --> 09:53.640]  really where from what I've seen in the business publications talking to
[09:53.640 --> 09:59.880]  business people talking to private individuals credit started to go up in a
[09:59.880 --> 10:04.320]  lot of sectors interest rates have been going up so I think I kind of just
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.720]  answered our own question right there Hilary has said she's sorry for illegally
[10:09.720 --> 10:14.560]  having secret emails well why did the head of the EPA have to stand down two
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.040]  years ago when she got caught using secret ones because it violates the
[10:19.040 --> 10:25.360]  National Security Act and it violates the Freedom of Information Act the open
[10:25.360 --> 10:33.480]  records act three acts they're all felonies she now says that it was a
[10:33.480 --> 10:40.920]  mistake an interview on ABC news Donald Trump has made a shocking statement we
[10:40.920 --> 10:46.120]  have to accept migrants here because they're living in hell in Syria there
[10:46.120 --> 10:48.800]  are people living in hell all over the world I don't have to accept them or
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.960]  pay for them if I want to give money to dig wells in Africa or I want to give
[10:53.960 --> 10:58.720]  money to the heifer project as I've been given for more than 12 years to buy
[10:58.720 --> 11:03.960]  cows for African villages or if I want to buy medical tables and and and medical
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.880]  beds for people in Central America which I've done and if I want to give money
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.800]  to Salvation Army which I've done I don't talk about my charity but I'll go
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.080]  ahead and talk about it I don't tithe the churches establishment whorehouses I
[11:17.080 --> 11:20.600]  found a good church I would there are some good ones out there I tithe
[11:20.600 --> 11:27.040]  directly to charities that I know give upwards of 85% that's a good metric to
[11:27.040 --> 11:31.480]  the actual people with no strings attached I have to go do major research
[11:31.480 --> 11:35.200]  that they're not forcing inoculations or they're not focusing a particular
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.960]  socialist worldview attached to that money you're giving to then politically
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.960]  take over those areas you want to give money give it to Salvation Army so I
[11:44.960 --> 11:53.560]  give way more money than probably anybody statistically that I know of and I
[11:53.560 --> 11:58.120]  do it because I have a job to do that if I'm for low taxes and if I'm for a
[11:58.120 --> 12:04.800]  small government then I'm supposed to give and that's what built this country
[12:04.800 --> 12:10.120]  and so I actually try to help people in fact if I try to try to get into all the
[12:10.120 --> 12:13.840]  charity I've given all the organizations I've been involved in and you know the
[12:13.840 --> 12:19.760]  sponsoring of children and all the rest of it the problem is it's a minefield to
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.080]  not have your money used to basically put them into a psychological and
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.960]  spiritual prison because yeah they'll buy them breakfast and shoes but then are
[12:29.960 --> 12:33.040]  you getting the full story of what happens with those charities that's
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.000]  something I've been wanting to do is do research on charities nobody's perfect
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.440]  no charity's perfect but to try to create basically a section on the side of
[12:43.440 --> 12:47.480]  charities that we've researched and that we believe are some of the better
[12:47.480 --> 12:53.200]  charities United Way and the Red Cross are some of the most evil organizations
[12:53.200 --> 12:56.400]  in the world doesn't mean if you volunteer for the Red Cross you're bad
[12:56.400 --> 13:00.600]  in a hurricane a lot of good folks volunteer that's their front about half
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.840]  the money in both groups goes to gun control teaching your kids all sorts of
[13:05.840 --> 13:10.800]  horrible things in school open borders globalism world government you name it
[13:10.800 --> 13:15.800]  and that's all come out in the news but I'm already digressing you give your
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.920]  money to those organizations you are insane I told you before it was ever in
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.200]  the news about the Clinton Foundation being an organized crime operation they're
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.640]  heavily involved with the bushes it is despicable when there's a hurricane or
[13:31.640 --> 13:36.760]  a earthquake in Haiti and then the bushes are up there on TV with Clinton
[13:36.760 --> 13:41.040]  going give money to our foundations we're combining our foundations so they can
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.640]  pay for private jets and hotels and houses I mean it's a sick joke I don't
[13:46.640 --> 13:51.040]  care if they paid for jet flights and hotels but that ought to be 10% of the
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.640]  money a healthy charity doesn't spend more than 15% on overhead that's just a
[13:56.640 --> 14:00.720]  fact so that that's a good metric right there of a charity if they're spending
[14:00.720 --> 14:09.320]  20 30 40% look out now I've got all this world news and I'm digressing here
[14:09.320 --> 14:14.640]  they are banning in Germany and in Poland and other areas publicly
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.680]  criticizing wide open borders that's called living in a dictatorship you're
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.040]  going to accept millions of people running around screaming you know at the
[14:22.040 --> 14:26.440]  top of their lungs they deserve everything free carjacking robbing I mean
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.840]  the videos are legion and if you criticize it we're going to arrest you
[14:30.840 --> 14:37.280]  boy the EU is really free associated press the latest Polish authorities ban
[14:37.280 --> 14:44.120]  anti-migrant rally your migrants if I want to go to Saudi Arabia I got to have
[14:44.120 --> 14:48.280]  a visa if I want to show up and get on welfare there they'll laugh at you
[14:48.280 --> 14:56.360]  they're not taking any of the migrants but if you want to criticize it they're
[14:56.360 --> 15:00.000]  going to arrest you and now in England in the rest of the UK you try to
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.640]  criticize it the police arrest you oh what free countries you live in you are
[15:06.640 --> 15:13.400]  captured by a criminal organization a mafia are narcotics child trafficking
[15:13.400 --> 15:21.120]  sex trafficking snuff film trafficking globalist system you look into NATO you
[15:21.120 --> 15:25.000]  look into Interpol you look into these groups I mean they are the worst of the
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.680]  worst they are specter they are killed by a pleasure curry Jackson's great
[15:32.680 --> 15:38.240]  intro he did on the allegory of Cobra in the real world and I make the point that
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.680]  major newspapers have made jokes out of that I think Cobra is real no in the
[15:42.680 --> 15:49.240]  video I say the allegory of Cobra is real secret organization in and out of
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.320]  government arms trafficking drugs trafficking money laundering wearing
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.520]  masks corporate board meetings hiding who they are the globalist always
[15:57.520 --> 16:11.240]  symbolize themselves as a hydra a snake an octopus that's who they are and so the
[16:11.240 --> 16:14.880]  new movie James Bond's coming out it's all about the Vatican and secret
[16:14.880 --> 16:19.680]  societies and specter what do you think the Bilderberg group and Club of

[16:52.840 --> 17:02.280]  seven-fold even though smoking has gone down do you have the nerve and the will
[17:02.280 --> 17:08.640]  to investigate and find out this is true or do you want to go quietly into the
[17:08.640 --> 17:17.760]  night and basically be exterminated because let me tell you as I've said
[17:17.760 --> 17:24.840]  you're not in Kansas anymore this is the real deal now that said I've been
[17:24.840 --> 17:30.200]  trying to think how to quantify this best to explain that our national symbol
[17:30.200 --> 17:35.840]  our national identity is having chips on our shoulders and racially freaking out
[17:35.840 --> 17:41.840]  and everyone making excuses for what they do because of what class or sex or
[17:41.840 --> 17:49.280]  supposed race they are and I look at the headlines today barbershop find for
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.440]  refusing to cut woman's hair they just said lady we don't do women's hair we
[17:53.440 --> 17:59.600]  don't have the curlers we don't we don't die here we don't we just cut here and
[17:59.600 --> 18:05.840]  they find them saying it was discrimination I guess you can't have a
[18:05.840 --> 18:10.920]  fraternal order of men or women Marine Corps women in combat experiment gets
[18:10.920 --> 18:15.480]  mixed results Washington Post you're not gonna have humans in combat soon that's
[18:15.480 --> 18:17.840]  why they're putting the women in now they're phasing it out they're
[18:17.840 --> 18:29.240]  sabotaging the human system football players who rammed ref claim he made
[18:29.240 --> 18:36.800]  racial slurs folks I played football in one of the most unracist areas you're
[18:36.800 --> 18:41.040]  gonna find even when I played football is is a football field where half the
[18:41.040 --> 18:46.520]  people on average are black I mean it's just ridiculous and there's no evidence
[18:46.520 --> 18:51.080]  that they made these slurs they physically attacked the ref
[18:51.080 --> 18:57.120]  speared him in the back which can kill somebody and then they're saying that
[18:57.120 --> 19:01.120]  it's because he said something racial
[19:04.360 --> 19:13.680]  racial slurs so and of course these kids go watch movies about discrimination
[19:13.680 --> 19:18.800]  in the 40s and 50s and stuff at baseball and it becomes red they relive
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.040]  football players and baseball players having racist things said to them they
[19:23.040 --> 19:26.840]  relive that they go out and then if you don't like the refs call you just attack
[19:26.840 --> 19:32.440]  them could be called attempted murder somebody's not wearing pads to hit them
[19:32.440 --> 19:38.520]  in the kidneys full on with your helmet and then even the coach is defending it

[24:01.920 --> 24:09.400]  don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I fell
[24:09.400 --> 24:17.640]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went hard and it
[24:17.640 --> 24:23.400]  burns burns burns well the Ayatollah Khomeini says Israel won't survive the
[24:23.400 --> 24:28.720]  next 25 years and it's burning taking to Twitter Iranian leaders as Zionists won't
[24:28.720 --> 24:35.880]  find serenity until destruction calls US great great Satan and rejects any
[24:35.880 --> 24:44.320]  talks with Washington beyond the nuke deal so that is Iran's response to the
[24:44.320 --> 24:48.720]  West trying to work with them and you got to ask what is Obama's real in game
[24:48.720 --> 24:54.560]  here and I don't want to attack Iran I don't want to destabilize Syria to try
[24:54.560 --> 24:58.520]  to bring down Iran I don't want to have war with Iran I want prosperity for the
[24:58.520 --> 25:04.920]  Persian people upwards of 75% international polls don't like the
[25:04.920 --> 25:15.200]  ruling Shiite rulers but Saudi Arabia is the majority of Islam it controls Mecca
[25:15.200 --> 25:22.640]  it controls the Wahhabist sect that is taking over Sunni religion that's very
[25:22.640 --> 25:30.280]  diverse and is radicalizing Islam it is the big threat so I wonder why Iran
[25:30.280 --> 25:35.920]  plays into the globalist program of acting like villains Shiites are 19% of
[25:35.920 --> 25:43.160]  Islam they are not aggressively expanding they do not generally launch terror
[25:43.160 --> 25:49.760]  attacks in the West they do run real paramilitary operations though against
[25:49.760 --> 25:56.320]  Western forces in the Middle East but they do have real sleeper cells all
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.200]  over the West of serious military operatives who will take action if
[26:02.200 --> 26:08.080]  there's a war with Iran and then Saudi Arabia is going to hit them with nukes
[26:08.080 --> 26:14.680]  along with Israel so there's no winner in any of this and if you collapse the
[26:14.680 --> 26:18.880]  Middle East further you're going to have even more refugees pouring into Europe
[26:18.880 --> 26:28.640]  and now Paul Watson has the article up on info wars.com it's incredible image
[26:28.640 --> 26:34.480]  after image showing the jihadists by name on their own Facebook page is
[26:34.480 --> 26:41.680]  showing what men they are now as refugees holding up their machine guns
[26:41.680 --> 26:50.200]  their 50 cows their rocket launchers now on the streets of Europe pouring in and
[26:50.200 --> 26:55.800]  al Qaeda and ISIS said three months ago two months ago a month ago we're gonna
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.680]  hit you with 500,000 refugees in the next few months and we're gonna flood in
[26:59.680 --> 27:05.680]  with our operatives and we're gonna hit you and now the attacks have started and
[27:05.680 --> 27:11.120]  if you try to go out and protest it you're in a town of 1,000 Germans 2,000
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.560]  legals show up one week you are arrested
[27:16.960 --> 27:22.360]  and then Donald Trump comes out and says we've got to take the Syrian refugees
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.600]  most of these people aren't even Syrian they're Pakistani they're Afghan that's
[27:27.600 --> 27:32.480]  in the news today and they're just showing up they're North African you name
[27:32.480 --> 27:40.040]  it no one else would take these people but our sick ruling class that can't
[27:40.040 --> 27:45.080]  wait for the class warfare and all the weird and we've got to adopt for their
[27:45.080 --> 27:49.040]  culture and her political correctness German women are being told don't wear
[27:49.040 --> 27:56.600]  short skirts now it offends the Muslims well I mean I don't want to offend you
[27:56.600 --> 28:03.080]  you've got your life I've got mine and I'll live how I want to but see no word
[28:03.080 --> 28:07.520]  from the feminist because they're not feminist they're sick freaks that want
[28:07.520 --> 28:12.560]  to go in a barber shop which is regular schmoes in Pittsburgh and go give me a
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.240]  haircut do my hair in curlers man we don't do women's hair we don't have
[28:17.240 --> 28:22.440]  the equipment oh really you're a sexist no we're a barber shop would we cut men's
[28:22.440 --> 28:32.320]  hair I'm gonna find you I'm going to the EEOC boom you're fine but oh we're not
[28:32.320 --> 28:39.200]  going to search the headdresses of the Islamist it's because Westerners are
[28:39.200 --> 28:44.080]  tolerant we're not just tolerant of third-world stone age culture coming in
[28:44.080 --> 28:47.920]  and dominating us because we have no culture I mean I watch these illegals
[28:47.920 --> 28:52.640]  we're tolerant of the hen pecking government that wants to end masculinity
[28:52.640 --> 28:59.520]  because it's something that might stand up to them I mean this is a full-on war
[28:59.520 --> 29:04.040]  and I just look at the women of the West that have bought into all this hype and
[29:04.040 --> 29:08.440]  the men that have done it they're all alone unhappy by the time they're 35 40
[29:08.440 --> 29:12.800]  they're desperate there are no men around I mean some of them by 35 they're
[29:12.800 --> 29:16.160]  like I was a big feminist I didn't want a man that wore the pants I didn't want
[29:16.160 --> 29:21.840]  now I do where are they I want one and there's all these guys trying to act
[29:21.840 --> 29:25.720]  like trendies and metrosexuals thinking they could get women that way you act
[29:25.720 --> 29:30.080]  like a real man you'll have women climbing over themselves no matter even
[29:30.080 --> 29:33.720]  how you look you see these guys that get it with their pot bellies and their
[29:33.720 --> 29:37.320]  wife beaters on they're treating their wife or their girlfriend nice but you
[29:37.320 --> 29:41.560]  know they're the boss when it comes to many issues the women eat it up because
[29:41.560 --> 29:46.760]  it's what humans do but don't worry you want the state to be your husband you'll
[29:46.760 --> 29:52.560]  give you cancer viruses and GMO we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex
[29:52.560 --> 29:56.840]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.760 --> 30:03.960]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax this is being
[30:03.960 --> 30:08.400]  reported by WorldNet daily ISIS terrorists gather together dozens of
[30:08.400 --> 30:12.640]  Christian men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia inspired tax and
[30:12.640 --> 30:16.720]  sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that
[30:16.720 --> 30:21.200]  could include the loss of life among the restrictions Christians cannot own
[30:21.200 --> 30:26.480]  guns build places of worship show their crosses in public or even ring church
[30:26.480 --> 30:30.560]  bells the terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that
[30:30.560 --> 30:34.680]  used to be dominated by the Christian faith but has been taken over by radical
[30:34.680 --> 30:39.760]  Muslims and while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions numerous
[30:39.760 --> 30:44.480]  people in power continue to fund groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda whether it's
[30:44.480 --> 30:48.520]  air-dropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles
[30:48.520 --> 30:52.040]  that they can use against this these terrorist groups always seem to find

[33:50.480 --> 33:55.400]  local am or fm station like we're on three stations in albuquerque right now
[33:55.400 --> 34:01.120]  or whether you're listening to shortwave of the internet or satellite
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.960]  I just mentioned albuquerque as I talked to the station owner yesterday about
[34:06.960 --> 34:11.080]  maybe coming out there sometime to speak to the big audience that's why I just
[34:11.080 --> 34:19.320]  said an example albuquerque with three radio stations 2 fm 1 a.m. coming up
[34:19.320 --> 34:28.120]  Ted Nugent is coming on Verizon has dropped Sportsman Channel one of the
[34:28.120 --> 34:34.440]  most popular channels they had and basically what's happening is they're
[34:34.440 --> 34:38.720]  phasing it out because they're anti-gun just like I have the London
[34:38.720 --> 34:45.480]  Telegraph here with the owners of the franchise of Ian Fleming's character
[34:45.480 --> 34:52.160]  James Bond saying he's misogynistic he's bad and the new James Bond in the future
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.000]  not this next movie but after that in novels and in film is going to be
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.880]  politically correct and they actually say here in the article a cast of
[35:02.880 --> 35:07.200]  characters will point out the error of the show of the stick ways including
[35:07.200 --> 35:11.760]  messages about smoking causing cancer women who give him a run for his money
[35:11.760 --> 35:19.320]  and an outspoken gay friend and the point is it's a directive it's everything
[35:19.320 --> 35:25.200]  from your five-year-olds being taught how to be cross-dressers to women in
[35:25.200 --> 35:33.520]  frontline combat to estrogen mimicers in the food to being fined for being
[35:33.520 --> 35:42.400]  discriminatory because a barber shop doesn't cut women's hair it I mean it's
[35:42.400 --> 35:47.320]  like walking in and saying I want you to color my hair I want you to to bleach
[35:47.320 --> 35:52.240]  my hair and they said lady we don't do that we just cut hair we got razors we
[35:52.240 --> 35:59.520]  got clippers we got scissors and the guys interviewed saying I guess I'll get
[35:59.520 --> 36:04.280]  the equipment we don't really have women come in here but okay he said I
[36:04.280 --> 36:10.000]  respect the law I'll pay the fine isn't even gonna fight back against it see it's
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.880]  that attitude of rolling over are you gonna support the law they say black
[36:13.880 --> 36:17.920]  people are slaves again I mean that's not gonna happen but that was a law you
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.080]  to support the law they can sterilize you if you make a c-minus that was the
[36:22.080 --> 36:30.360]  law till the 30s late 30s gonna support the law they ban alcohol again the law
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.840]  is just a law that people make and folks don't even fight back against these
[36:34.840 --> 36:39.280]  laws if they're unconstitutional they just say all right well I didn't mean
[36:39.280 --> 36:44.400]  anything I mean I just told her we don't do women's hair I don't know how I've
[36:44.400 --> 36:50.440]  been cutting women men's hair for decades okay I'll do what you say good I
[36:50.440 --> 36:56.320]  just came in here and pecked on some men this bastion of male chauvinist in
[36:56.320 --> 37:00.720]  here no it's men that want to whip in like that this is they were kids and
[37:00.720 --> 37:06.080]  get your hair cut in 10 or 15 minutes and not have to wait where you show up
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.880]  and the guy that's gonna cut your hair is doing some woman's hair and he's 30
[37:10.880 --> 37:18.840]  minutes behind they're called barber shops women don't go to them women want
[37:18.840 --> 37:24.600]  their hair done more fancy unless they're Rachel Maddow I guess she might go to
[37:24.600 --> 37:29.160]  the barber shop who cares letter Janet Reno barbershop Hilary Clinton
[37:29.160 --> 37:34.440]  barbershop hell I go into the barbershop Hilary's there like hey Sam they don't
[37:34.440 --> 37:40.920]  hey Bob hey Hilary of course Hilary wouldn't want to work at a barber shop
[37:40.920 --> 37:48.320]  there's no women in there and I get it Hilary I like women too the difference
[37:48.320 --> 37:53.200]  is I don't want to be forced to adopt your entire culture because you want to
[37:53.200 --> 38:01.400]  dominate me culturally and lecture me all day so we've got Ted Nugent joining
[38:01.400 --> 38:06.200]  us and then Carl Pittman running for sheriff in Harris County where we saw
[38:06.200 --> 38:10.360]  the police officer's sheriff's deputy executed he's running down there he's a
[38:10.360 --> 38:16.600]  decorated Marine and police officer sheriff's deputy and he's worked all
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.000]  over the country and he's got the endorsement of the Constitutional
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.960]  Association and of course help promote and push and launch the
[38:23.960 --> 38:29.640]  international career now of Sheriff Clark in Milwaukee and they're behind
[38:29.640 --> 38:36.040]  Carl Pittman he was on last week with Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson really
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.480]  impressive type of guy when he's also got Sheriff Joe or Pio's endorsement he
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.680]  says simple he's not left or right he's a constitutionalist and he will uphold
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.800]  the Constitution period it's not about being black or white it's about being a
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.520]  constitutionalist and I'll vote for anybody don't care what color you are
[38:54.520 --> 38:58.240]  it's such an insult that even say you know I'll vote for somebody no matter
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.400]  what color they are if they stand for the freedom well of course I would but
[39:03.400 --> 39:07.880]  see what the Democrats more and more they vote racially that's how they're
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.800]  branding all of it because they can look at the demographic and just like the
[39:12.800 --> 39:15.800]  Democrats could win back when the country's majority whites they were the
[39:15.800 --> 39:20.440]  party of the Klan then as soon as the Republicans pass a civil rights act they
[39:20.440 --> 39:26.680]  then flip sides and now they've turned the minority coalitions basically into
[39:26.680 --> 39:32.000]  black and Hispanic Ku Klux Klan type rhetoric organizations so Carl Pittman's
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.280]  gonna be in studio coming up here from H town up to up to the ATX Austin Texas
[39:38.280 --> 39:45.640]  so we look forward to that both guest amazing today I want to get into the
[39:45.640 --> 39:50.360]  incredible news on the flotillas hitting Europe I want to get more into
[39:50.360 --> 39:55.200]  political correctness I want to get into the World Bank and their
[39:55.200 --> 40:04.560]  announcements there all of this is coming up but first knockout is back if
[40:04.560 --> 40:14.280]  you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body
[40:14.280 --> 40:19.720]  to relax your brain to relax so you get deep restful sleep knockouts it we had
[40:19.720 --> 40:23.400]  an introductory shipment in of this product we developed over the last few
[40:23.400 --> 40:31.440]  years and sold out in four days so we put in a giant order of it so we should
[40:31.440 --> 40:37.240]  have enough for a few months hopefully it's in L theanine hops flour extract
[40:37.240 --> 40:41.840]  lemon balm extract valerian root extract chamomile flour extract L tryptophan
[40:41.840 --> 40:47.080]  extract melatonin and more all organic all the natural sources it's the same
[40:47.080 --> 40:51.760]  price as leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece it has
[40:51.760 --> 40:55.520]  three milligram the standard recommended does for an adult and it's the same
[40:55.520 --> 41:03.040]  price but it has its big tablets because it's got the GABA the L theanine the
[41:03.040 --> 41:06.680]  hops flour all the stuff I just mentioned in it it's got a big dose of
[41:06.680 --> 41:13.800]  valerian roof 30 milligrams so it would probably cost $50 to take all this to
[41:13.800 --> 41:20.720]  separate pills it's 1995 and it's not like you're gonna run off the road when
[41:20.720 --> 41:25.160]  you take this like sleeping pills you take one or two of these and it just is
[41:25.160 --> 41:29.120]  really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are it's what I've experienced
[41:29.120 --> 41:33.120]  and it just synergistically puts everything in there it puts the pre
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.200]  cursor natural compounds in that break down into melatonin so it's not just
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.240]  melatonin it's got the stuff that's in turkey and in red meat but high levels
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.880]  are in turkey the L tryptophan that then breaks down into that so your body even
[41:47.880 --> 41:52.560]  absorbs that differently so it hits you at both angles it basically hits you
[41:52.560 --> 41:58.360]  from all angles and I got one bottle of it it's sold out in three four days I
[41:58.360 --> 42:05.040]  wanted more didn't have it this went home with me last night I took two bottles
[42:05.040 --> 42:11.360]  home and I'm taking it and I'm also giving it to my children when I'm
[42:11.360 --> 42:14.880]  stupid enough to give them sugar late at night or they're all jacked up and it
[42:14.880 --> 42:18.880]  certainly helps them sleep it's hard to get them up at 6 30 in the morning when
[42:18.880 --> 42:21.640]  they've gone to bed at 8 30 the night before when I give them this if not
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.440]  sometimes they're up in the middle of the night you know how kids are especially
[42:25.440 --> 42:27.640]  when they're excited about the school you're starting or whatever the case
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.600]  may be that products back we will sell out of liver shield we're trying to get

[44:33.600 --> 44:37.280]  our power plants or putting in regulations to shut down jobs forcing
[44:37.280 --> 44:41.640]  Obamacare through to break our political and financial back they need to break us
[44:41.640 --> 44:46.200]  right now because they know we're on the verge of a massive political
[44:46.200 --> 44:49.960]  realignment and they admit that themselves so that's why they're being
[44:49.960 --> 44:55.120]  so naked it's a it's a calm game yeah you can't say father or mother you know
[44:55.120 --> 45:01.120]  wearing the pants as a man is racist or and and hateful it's government and

[45:33.160 --> 45:38.440]  rottening right now is the getting all the dumb collaborators and boobs and
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.640]  fools and everybody else that are foundation funded to bring the country
[45:42.640 --> 45:47.120]  down and the exact same tactics are being used in Europe so we see the
[45:47.120 --> 45:52.520]  arrogance and the floodgates being opened that's because they are trying to
[45:52.520 --> 45:59.200]  compress being 15 years behind in their agenda 15 years into two or three years
[45:59.200 --> 46:02.880]  so that's why all hell's breaking loose that's why suddenly yeah we're setting
[46:02.880 --> 46:06.240]  up world government if you don't like it we'll arrest you yeah we're gonna give
[46:06.240 --> 46:10.600]  you force inoculations yeah we're gonna have world taxes and world regulations

[46:26.240 --> 46:32.040]  computer watching you at home and tracking everywhere you go they're
[46:32.040 --> 46:36.280]  just throwing the gauntlet down yeah we're gonna bring millions of illegals
[46:36.280 --> 46:40.440]  a year and legalize them into Europe and just make you accept them and if you
[46:40.440 --> 46:45.840]  try to protest it we're gonna arrest you that's associated press in Poland and
[46:45.840 --> 46:49.800]  Germany and now France says somebody wants to car jack your car you give it
[46:49.800 --> 46:55.200]  to them with any legal no police reports are filed nothing's done there's videos
[46:55.200 --> 46:59.880]  and photos old ladies being drug out of cars g-hotties posted on their face
[46:59.880 --> 47:04.680]  books hey women you know I'm in Prague now I'm in Berlin now you want a hot G
[47:04.680 --> 47:09.240]  Hottie here I am and they post on their Facebook I'm here I'm a refugee now
[47:09.240 --> 47:18.120]  ladies let's party and the welfare is given to them boom and it's done
[47:20.360 --> 47:27.560]  posing with rocket launchers and machine guns and then when they attack
[47:27.560 --> 47:33.320]  when there's terrorist attacks you will lose your freedoms you will lose your
[47:33.320 --> 47:38.120]  basic liberties you will have your rights taken to keep you safe and you'll
[47:38.120 --> 47:43.520]  probably be screened like when I've been in Europe I just find it ironic that
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.440]  it's hardcore practicing Muslims women with their hands covered their their
[47:48.440 --> 47:54.440]  faces covered on the sides searching me and I'm not against Muslims in general
[47:54.440 --> 47:58.640]  but radical Islam is being given the power by Saudi Arabia in the West to
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.320]  take over bully everyone into it and then you go to England you go to Germany
[48:03.320 --> 48:09.360]  you go to Spain you go to Italy and you're there and half the people screening
[48:09.360 --> 48:16.120]  you sometimes more are folks that can't hardly speak English or can't speak
[48:16.120 --> 48:25.840]  Spanish and they're grabbing your genitals and America and Europe deserves
[48:25.840 --> 48:30.600]  to be conquered we deserve to be overrun we deserve to be slaves because we are
[48:30.600 --> 48:35.680]  we're slack jawed pathetic slaves that don't stand up for the Constitution and
[48:35.680 --> 48:40.480]  that don't deserve freedom I hate to be nasty about it but it's true Donald
[48:40.480 --> 48:43.480]  Trump struck a nerve when he pointed out that Latin America is collapsing of a
[48:43.480 --> 48:49.960]  hundred thousand dead people in nine years in Mexico it's unraveling and we've
[48:49.960 --> 48:52.920]  got millions of illegals a year coming in here people having their babies for
[48:52.920 --> 48:56.760]  free everything paid for a lot of them criminals and Donald Trump points that
[48:56.760 --> 49:01.200]  out and they act like it's crazy why he said the sky is blue and that the sun
[49:01.200 --> 49:06.640]  is yellow and he told that fish swim in the ocean he's crazy and they all act
[49:06.640 --> 49:12.320]  like it's wild and upturn reality invert reality we're gonna go out to break with
[49:12.320 --> 49:15.800]  Donald Trump saying we've got to accept the immigrants you know he tells the
[49:15.800 --> 49:21.040]  truth about these Arab countries and African countries won't take them but
[49:21.040 --> 49:24.320]  that we've got to because we have the moral high ground the whole world
[49:24.320 --> 49:28.280]  collapsing into depression we can't take billions of people especially if they're
[49:28.280 --> 49:34.760]  put on welfare this is suicide let's go to the clip well it's a serious problem
[49:34.760 --> 49:38.880]  we haven't seen anything like it since the Second World War and it's getting
[49:38.880 --> 49:42.520]  worse and worse and I was actually impressed in one way but surprised that
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.680]  Merkel in Germany allowed this to happen because they're really flowing
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.640]  through all over Europe and if you notice Russia is not taking and China is
[49:51.640 --> 49:56.880]  not taking and the Gulf States whether you look at Saudi Arabia or Qatar or any
[49:56.880 --> 50:01.960]  of them they're taking none but some of them are and some of them are actually
[50:01.960 --> 50:07.760]  being very generous it just really I wonder you know where all these really
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.000]  Donald being generous with the Germans that pay some of the highest taxes in
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.920]  Europe of the French that pay 84% on average for people to come in and get
[50:16.920 --> 50:23.760]  put on welfare I mean you read the scams that Third World immigrants run all
[50:23.760 --> 50:26.840]  across the place Somalis up in Minnesota
[50:26.840 --> 50:32.640]  Afghans in Germany I mean they just don't pay the taxes they don't they do
[50:32.640 --> 50:37.680]  whatever they want they run black market operations and they get welfare and then
[50:37.680 --> 50:42.280]  oh I want to come in Merkel she's so generous hey Trump shut your fat mouth
[50:42.280 --> 50:47.360]  you punk I knew you'd start flip-flopping my gut told me something how about you
[50:47.360 --> 50:55.480]  give your five billion dollars to him okay I'm telling you man he was against
[50:55.480 --> 50:59.080]  abortion then he was for it then he was against it all the rest of it he loves

[54:03.040 --> 54:07.680]  riders on the storm
[54:07.680 --> 54:15.960]  riders on the storm it was in 2004 the poll watching on an article when Google
[54:15.960 --> 54:19.960]  put out a press release to its shareholders saying we're going to use
[54:19.960 --> 54:25.200]  the microphones and cameras on computers to listen to everything going on in
[54:25.200 --> 54:29.000]  your house and watch it and then put it into an algorithm so we hear a dog
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.960]  barking was the example we will then have dog food or dog accessory ads pop up
[54:34.960 --> 54:40.400]  on your computer then we saw in California and Pennsylvania and other
[54:40.400 --> 54:44.680]  areas where kids would be at home with their government-issued laptops and then
[54:44.680 --> 54:50.000]  one girl was eating skittles on her bed in her night down and the teacher called
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.240]  the police on her and they said yeah we watch you at home they didn't tell
[54:53.240 --> 54:58.840]  anybody it's not creepy see they just do it in plain view and then I was just
[54:58.840 --> 55:03.520]  talking to Joe Jennings and Marcos Morales has noted this too with the max
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.120]  in our office we'll be talking about something but it knows what it's
[55:08.120 --> 55:12.480]  listening to and only sample sometimes this is now I'll admit it but they go
[55:12.480 --> 55:17.640]  it's not a person it's a computer with keyword I want to get a new bed I was
[55:17.640 --> 55:20.400]  thinking about you know get one maybe with like black leather and then a black
[55:20.400 --> 55:25.600]  leather bed an hour later pops up in an ad Joe Jennings car he hadn't searched it
[55:25.600 --> 55:29.920]  let's talk about it right now I'll talk about Donald Trump more Joe Jennings has
[55:29.920 --> 55:34.200]  a Samsung phone Samsung in its terms of agreement with its cell phones and its
[55:34.200 --> 55:39.680]  TVs going back a year and a half ago put in the terms of service watch what
[55:39.680 --> 55:43.840]  you say and do we're listening we're watching and selling it to third parties
[55:43.840 --> 55:49.880]  so he hadn't even searched yet on his phone he was checking the weather he
[55:49.880 --> 55:58.160]  hadn't even searched yet on his phone for a battery his car battery was dead he
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.640]  wrote it on his motorcycle this morning and it had car battery ads for him
[56:03.640 --> 56:08.040]  coincidence no because I could show you their announcements they're doing it
[56:08.040 --> 56:13.000]  let's go to Joe Jennings Joe again people know this is big brothers they have
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.600]  Tennessee say oh this isn't happening but everyone I know the last few years
[56:16.600 --> 56:20.520]  this is happening to where it knows what's going on your house or it knows
[56:20.520 --> 56:24.280]  what you're saying and then they admit they're doing it but still people can't
[56:24.280 --> 56:29.040]  believe it Joe yeah it's just kind of weird I mean usually I can understand if
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.080]  you're typing it in and you know you're you're searching on the web or whatever
[56:33.080 --> 56:37.760]  it got admit cookies are doing that you know but I had not searched car batteries
[56:37.760 --> 56:42.480]  today didn't search anything like that just mentioned today to CJ and the guys
[56:42.480 --> 56:48.280]  that I had to ride my bike in because the battery in my car died and then when
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.600]  I searched the weather to see what I'm gonna ride home in car battery ad comes
[56:54.600 --> 57:02.040]  up 6% off car batteries need a battery it's just kind of weird well the first
[57:02.040 --> 57:05.600]  time it happens you're like oh that's a coincidence about the 30th or 40th it's
[57:05.600 --> 57:10.880]  constantly happening oh yeah and that's you know I got the newer Samsung phone
[57:10.880 --> 57:15.560]  so it really listens to you well they admit it is I mean I want new listeners
[57:15.560 --> 57:19.360]  understand it's a normal response to go this is crazy it's not happening this
[57:19.360 --> 57:24.120]  guy's nuts look it up there's an info wars.com article just type in Samsung
[57:24.120 --> 57:28.280]  TVs admit they're listening and we can put it on screen I forget the exact
[57:28.280 --> 57:33.080]  headline but it was from last year and this is really going on just like I
[57:33.080 --> 57:37.560]  told you five years ago in the Obama deceptions that they're gonna ban the
[57:37.560 --> 57:41.960]  word mother and father and now they're doing it I'm going off what the global
[57:41.960 --> 57:47.560]  is say they're gonna do Samsung responds to privacy concerns over TVs
[57:47.560 --> 57:50.600]  recording personal conversations yeah that's the second article and they
[57:50.600 --> 57:56.000]  responded to us go to the original article and and they have a video
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.520]  tutorial there'll be a link about article put it back up and I'll show
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.240]  there it is Samsung admits private conversations being sent to internet
[58:03.240 --> 58:10.560]  server smart TVs prompt privacy backlash and I was told by a Time Warner
[58:10.560 --> 58:18.440]  executives a high-level engineer in 1997 that the scientific Atlantic digital
[58:18.440 --> 58:21.520]  cable boxes that were coming in had a microphone in them and then it was being
[58:21.520 --> 58:27.960]  listened to he also told me DVRs would soon come out record shows that they
[58:27.960 --> 58:31.160]  watch what we watch in all the rhythms that came out a few years later we
[58:31.160 --> 58:36.800]  broke it apart I did on TV and showed people I got death threats okay so they
[58:36.800 --> 58:39.840]  didn't want you to know that we'll be back with the whole Donald Trump thing
[58:39.840 --> 58:45.840]  then we got a special guest in studio visit GCN Live. Donald Trump shows Germany's
[58:45.840 --> 58:51.880]  generous take all the illegals in. Alex Jones here with a very important news alert

[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:37.040]  switches deep in the heart of Austin Texas broadcast from worldwide look I
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.560]  want to support Donald Trump what he's been saying has been true my problem is
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.480]  is that he's flip-flops so much probably how much he loves Hillary Clinton in the
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.920]  past been for abortion I just don't trust him but as he champions liberty
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.440]  causes you have to defend what he's saying because they're trying to destroy
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.520]  him even if he is a straw man well now he's come out and pointed out that all
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.880]  these other countries won't take all these islamists filled with ISIS and
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.800]  al-Qaeda people that's now admitted and he says Merkel's being very generous and
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.040]  he commends Germany and that we need to take some of these immigrants that's
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:18.800]  what Obama's about to do so I would much rather take Latin American or Chinese
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.880]  immigrants even if they're getting free welfare and stuff than radical jihadists
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.560]  filled groups they I mean al-Qaeda admits they're putting their people in
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.800]  these groups in mass and now we have photos of them with rocket launchers and
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:35.320]  machine guns today on info wars.com it's a sensational article we got to get it
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.840]  out to everybody in fact I want to do a Facebook mentions during the next break
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.800]  buckly I want you to go back right now if you're listening I know you're doing
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.800]  work talk to the sheriff's candidate as he walks in I want it live as we meet
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.200]  the stuff and then during another break I'm gonna be doing the Facebook mentions
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:02:00.160]  that our main Facebook talking about this because it's just insane to have
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.960]  images show jihadist militants entering Europe as refugees as ISIS promised they
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.600]  would do that needs to go mega viral it's on info wars.com right now but
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.680]  here here's Donald Trump and you know I don't want to call him a punk but he's
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.320]  really smart he's one of the slickest speakers I know he knows full well what
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:24.280]  he's doing and I warn people Rand Paul needs to be radical now and then if he
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:28.720]  has to moderate to get the presidency later that's the strategy to win not be
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:34.600]  moderate now and then be radical later because I know Rand Paul's good if he
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:40.520]  plays little politics I'm not really for it but I understand it with Trump is he
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.320]  was always basically a Democrat before and a Hillary lover and involved in a
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:52.480]  bunch of shenanigans until now and so that's why I've said watching here is
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.520]  the clip just just just just play Trump here he is on a Riley last night well
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.800]  it's a serious problem we haven't seen anything like it since the second world
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.160]  war and it's getting worse and worse and I was actually impressed in one way but
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.720]  surprised that Merkel in Germany allowed this to happen because they're really
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.240]  flowing through all over Europe and if you notice Russia is not taking and
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.120]  China is not taking and the Gulf States whether you look at Saudi Arabia or
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.240]  Qatar or any of them they're taking none but some of them are and some of them
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:30.440]  are actually being very generous it just really I wonder you know where all
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.600]  these people are coming from exactly and what are they representing because do
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.280]  you have people from ISIS in that group you know there's a lot of security risk
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.720]  with it but something has to be done it's a an unbelievable humanitarian
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.600]  problem Israel's not taking any Britain's taken a few maybe five thousand you know
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.560]  thousands will come to the United States as migrants now do you object to
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.400]  migrants who are getting out of the Middle East or Africa do you object to
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.320]  them coming to the USA I hate the concept of it but on a humanitarian basis
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.800]  with what's happening you have to you know this was started by President
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.880]  Obama when he didn't go in and do the job when he should have when he drew the
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.400]  line in the sand which turned out to be a very artificial line but you know it's
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.680]  it's living in hell in Syria there's no question about it they're living in
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.040]  hell so you would have they're living in hell and then he goes on with a full clip
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.400]  about the transcript here for reason that cut off early saying we got to take
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:36.000]  them just just insane and then he acts like Obama drew a line in the sand to
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.760]  take out a sod as if he didn't take out of sides why this happened no NATO backed
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.840]  the jihadis to do this and now they've invaded back into Iraq and most these
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.000]  people coming in they've checked our Wahhabist and are the ones trying to take
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.680]  Syria over but they couldn't so now they'll just take the welfare in Europe
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:00.160]  I mean this is the shadow army of the globalist invading over the Labor Day
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:05.600]  weekend we had reports of eight being killed and 46 being wounded July 4th of
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.520]  this year we had reports of nine dead in 53 wounded and let us not forget July
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:16.480]  4th of last year we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot and these are not
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:21.520]  nationwide stats all of these numbers come from the city of Chicago the city
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.040]  with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation which is to say if criminals
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.400]  expect you to be unarmed they're more likely to attack you not to mention the
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.840]  fact that much of this violence is linked to gangs or drug activity meaning
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.160]  that for all the gun buybacks and anti-gun commercials criminals just
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.760]  haven't decided to turn in their firearms and I understand that police have
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.880]  many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once but that's why you
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.320]  have a second amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself you can find

[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.520]  biggest city in the United States that's the county it's in the county itself is
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.160]  just exploding that's where Carl Pittman grew up he was in the Marine Corps for
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.880]  more than a decade and started his own successful private business in real
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.160]  estate then went back into law enforcement and has worked at a lot
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.880]  different levels of the Harris County Sheriff's Department running Task Force
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:11.960]  you name it that internal affairs so he's done a lot Carl for sheriff calm
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.680]  I've seen this guy give speeches he was on the show last week when Jakari and Joe
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:23.640]  Biggs were hosting and just as patriotic just as good just as articulate as say
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:28.360]  Richard Mack or a David Clark I mean this is the type of sheriff we need what
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.400]  a victory and one of the biggest counties in the country that have a
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.480]  constitutional sheriff he's not right wing or left wing I'm not speaking for
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.880]  have followed you quite a bit he's not right wing or left wing folks he's a
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:44.440]  constitutionalist which means follow the rules of the country and so it's great
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.400]  to have you sir we're very honored you drove up from Houston to be here with
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:53.160]  us obviously I want to cover the waterfront with the lawlessness of the
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.720]  government your words we're talking before you went live what you think the
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.240]  large strategy is what do you think Soros is doing with his agitators
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.040]  openly out promoting deck the halls with dead cops at Christmas put wings on
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.440]  them fry the bacon obviously there's some bad police out there there's bad
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.920]  anybody but what what do the Democrats think they're doing seems like jumping
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.000]  the shark to just nakedly try to start a war with local police is that an attempt
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.760]  to intimidate local jurisdictions and a going under not even federal control but
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.480]  this leftist globalist control break down your worldview some about yourself
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.120]  what you really think is happening and what you would do heading up one of the
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:37.760]  biggest counties most populous counties in the country well I'll tell you what
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.680]  we have going on in the United States right now is an attempt by those in our
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:51.600]  government those that have been elected to lead this country and we find that
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.760]  these people are much more concerned with their own agendas than the agenda of
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.520]  taking care of the people in this country and I think what we've seen lately
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.080]  whether it's in Ferguson or Baltimore when you see what the president of the
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:13.440]  United States has done and I'm quite embarrassed that he has spent most of
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.480]  his time apologizing for America instead of standing up and supporting and
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:24.440]  defending the Constitution but you know he is quick to go down and support you
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:30.680]  know support activity that in my opinion is just simply bad behavior so you know
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:37.280]  Michael Brown the situation in New York this situation in Baltimore we are
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.640]  watching the absolute erosion of law in order in this country and so it's a
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.920]  dangerous thing it's what we have to get away from it's what I would encourage
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:51.520]  every single law enforcement officer in this country to do but I a special call
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:56.480]  out to the elected sheriffs of the county you are in the perfect position to
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.000]  stand up against this kind of behavior because if we do not do it we are going
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.200]  to we're going to witness the collapse of America and I just don't want to see
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.960]  that happen I used to hear old-timers like general Benton K. Parton who headed
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.120]  up you know major anti-Soviet operations former head of the Air Force and not
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.520]  just Air Force weapons development he also ran all the secret projects and
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.360]  he he's now older and retired he's very old but when he used to come on the show
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.600]  he would lay out once the left gets control they just don't want power
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:33.000]  they're going to cause a revolution to bring down local government and then
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.440]  basically use that crisis to have a war on the police the military they want a
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.080]  violent overthrow and I'd read Saul Alenstein the rest of it and I knew that
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.640]  was part of the plan I knew the weatherman had basically tutored Obama but
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.640]  still you don't imagine that once they get control they'd really want to wreck
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.040]  the country and make it poor with clowered and piven but that's what
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.120]  they're doing and when you see them really trying to bring the country down
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.240]  our founders said this country couldn't be taken down from without we beat the
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.000]  greatest empire the world ever seen but we could fall from within absolutely and
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.400]  we are I think seeing the fall what do you think their in-game is I think they're
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:19.360]  in-game if you have paid attention to this new world order and there is such
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.360]  an attempt to destroy capitalism and the way that most of us have come to
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.840]  recognize America this is against everything these people believe in so
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:36.640]  is it any surprise that Barack Obama is so supportive or silent when it comes to
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:43.000]  even calling ISIS ISIS I mean there is a reason why you know I look back to my
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.760]  childhood if you want to know who I am take a snapshot and look at my mother
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:55.840]  my mother I'm I'm what she produced Barack Obama is a very good product of
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.600]  his mother so if you want to do a little reading and and find out why he is the
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.520]  way he is take a look at his mother those are the influences early in his
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.680]  life and so what we're seeing shouldn't be a surprise to anyone it shouldn't be
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.520]  a surprise anyone which surprises me is that he managed to get reelected well
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.840]  you've been the American success story from a constitutional perspective tell
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.480]  folks who's running for sheriff why Ted Nugent's endorsing you Sheriff Arpaio
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.960]  Sheriff Richard Mack and and and so many others because this is bigger than
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.120]  just Houston we need to get people like you of every race color and creed to run
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.400]  for sheriff around the country and support good peace officers that have
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.520]  good records like you do talk about your life well you know simply put I was
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:48.920]  born in a Folser Texas two-room house no running water until I was 15 and my
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.520]  mother simply taught us after my dad died when I was in first grade that if we
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.400]  worked hard we could do whatever we set our mind to we didn't have to accept
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.360]  where we started as an endpoint and so therefore I applied myself I worked hard
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.040]  and but by the grace of God I was able to accomplish many things in my life but
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.560]  had I fallen into this thinking that I need to wait for the government to do
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.640]  everything for me I might very well be sitting in that same little two-room
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:24.320]  house in Folser and it was something that I believe that I owe something to not
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.240]  only those members of my family that came before me but I owe something to all
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:35.200]  of the Americans that came before me across the spectrum of the races
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.800]  because there were sacrifices made for this country that quite frankly those
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.240]  trying to destroy it ought to be ashamed but you know I have the endorsement of
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:51.120]  Joe Arpaio because Joe absolutely understands that if we do not stem the
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.120]  tide of this illegal alien problem and I call it illegal alien problem because
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.200]  it is illegal and they are aliens well notice they're taking the giant influx
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.200]  out of out of North Africa and out of the Middle East filled with ISIS people
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.760]  migrants but no one else calls them migrants Saudi Arabia won't take them
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.240]  they tell us what words to use like we're in a cult or something well I mean
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.680]  you're right if they are illegal aliens Mexico if I try to go down there and have
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.920]  a baby for free calls me an illegal alien under their federal law and will put me
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.960]  for a year in a labor camp so why don't they get criticized why do we have to
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.600]  give everything for free please continue well I I think the problem is is the
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:36.120]  liberal left the Democrat Party in this country they're hunting votes they want
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.840]  votes so they think if they can make friends by allowing all of these
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.840]  illegals to come in they're going to fall in line and give them their votes
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.080]  you go back and take a look in the history of this country and we'll take
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:54.400]  just a snapshot of what LBJ did LBJ knew absolutely for sure that if he did
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.040]  not figure out a way to get black Americans on board with the Democrat
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.480]  Party it was going to be a short short time before that party was gone because
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.440]  blacks were conservative and wouldn't go for communism absolutely and go back
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.600]  and start you look at what Lincoln did I believe Lincoln ended up giving his
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.240]  life ultimately for getting slaves freed in this country but so many black
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.960]  Americans fall in line with this idea that the Democrat Party is there to
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:28.160]  help him you look at the Jim Crow laws in the south written and promoted along
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.440]  with the Klan promoted by the Democrat Party but most black Americans that fall
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:38.360]  in line with that thinking that the Democrat Party is there to help them
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:44.360]  and save them all this free-for-all give everything away does is create in my
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:49.920]  opinion it is a continuation of many blacks have never been able to leave
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.000]  the plantation and that is a sad sad state of affairs well they admit under
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.640]  clout and pivot they want everybody black white Hispanic the economy show
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.760]  bankrupt you got to go on welfare I mean that that's their in-game plan they
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.360]  don't hide it that's what's so crazy well well many of these people who are
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.400]  falling in and thinking that the Democrat parties are to help them when
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:13.200]  all this goes bad it'll be far too late for them to figure it out but the end
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.040]  game is there's going to be the super elite and those with nothing yep that's
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.560]  where is nothing in the middle that's why George Soros how does Soros because I
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.800]  mean I would never say this because I'm not a cold-blooded killer and I believe
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.280]  people should be tried for crimes they've committed I want to process how
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.280]  does Soros get away and and then the White House as well the Justice
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:38.480]  Department clearly running and funding groups saying go out kill the police just
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.560]  randomly police are to blame for all the problems and in wire police groups
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.680]  around the country they're starting to respond but it seems like they're not
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.800]  fighting hard enough against this and saying we know what you're doing I just
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.000]  can't believe they're this arrogant well quite simply this idea of being
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.280]  political correct politically correct it's got people scared to death to stand
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:06.040]  up and say what needs to be said and do what needs to be done so Barack Obama
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:09.800]  can virtually do anything he wants he's going to get a pass so people are
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:17.000]  paralyzed oh absolutely paralyzed with fear because God forbid if a conservative
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.240]  particularly a white conservative says something against the president
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:27.000]  instantaneously deemed to be a racist you know I look at it and say I'm going
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.760]  to judge this man on his performance the only thing I'm going to pick by colors
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.640]  maybe a suit or maybe a car but everything else I'm looking for good
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.200]  performance Barack Obama has been one of the most radical poor performing
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:44.360]  president at least in my lifetime black unemployment's doubled yes absolutely and
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:49.000]  most black people are still supporting him for one reason simply because he
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.520]  looks like and that's embarrassing opposite what Martin Luther King said
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:57.000]  absolutely it's it's inverted reality it's insane we're gonna come back and

[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.400]  the real deal he's not a fake he is a maniac I love maniacs he's and he
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:02.440]  travels around the country just like Charlton Heston did who was a big part
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.600]  of the real civil rights movement when Republicans got it passed it wasn't the
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.560]  Democrats and again I'm even a Republican is the leadership so bad that
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.240]  you know they're a bunch of blue blood rhinos but it's just weird how the
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.960]  Republicans are the ones that got all that done in Eisenhower and my
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:22.160]  grandfather that ran for office in East Texas and won on a you know pro
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.880]  integration platform and then the Democrats just flipped it around and
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:31.960]  said the MRA is the Klan I mean they just invert reality but but speaking of
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.560]  inverting reality I've been asking a lot of the questions here but but but what
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.880]  are some of the other points you want to get out about what this country is
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.600]  facing because what I like that you have to say in your speeches is we're in a
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.160]  lot of trouble I mean we're not embellishing this in fact I keep getting
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:54.960]  amazed sir at how aggressive and crazy the left is they're not even the left
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:00.080]  it's like a totalitarian criminal cult that knows exactly what they're doing
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:07.840]  so Sheriff Pittman what do you say about that well remember what is helping to
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:13.120]  push this movement because of social programs in this country welfare
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.560]  there's a lot of people out there that have attached their existence and
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.720]  livelihood on getting free stuff from the government so can you imagine anyone
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.400]  that would advocate getting rid of that would obviously be viewed as the enemy
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.320]  when conservatives simply want to empower people to take care of themselves
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:38.320]  now that's a problem for a lot of people if you've watched your grandmother your
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.720]  mother sit at home and wait to open the mailbox to get a check or food stamps or
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:48.480]  free phones or whatever housing subsidies it's really difficult to convince
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.360]  these people that getting up going to work's a pretty good idea now I grew up
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.480]  my entire life doing it I'm sure so did you so I was 13 my dad said go get a job
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.880]  absolutely that's what it's about you know I hate the fact that I'm paying
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.360]  taxes and I don't like paying taxes I and I surely don't want to pay high taxes
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.440]  but the fact that I know that there is some cost to make this country work I
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:19.080]  would be so pleased if simply the government would do what the Constitution
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:23.360]  gave it the authority to do they'll just deliver the mail on time that'd be
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:28.400]  pretty good but they've dipped themselves into everything and what we keep
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:35.600]  watching happen is this idea that it's certain people against certain other
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.160]  peoples and I think race is one of the most dangerous and volatile issues
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.960]  because they know that it is something that they can bring people into their
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.040]  their camp to do some pretty bad things Ted Cruz called it the fascist left and
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.320]  I agree with that because this isn't the left I've known in the past that had some
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.520]  good ideas this is really a group craze that wants full power and I think they're
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.800]  doing it because they realize there's a movement against it gaining steam and
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:07.000]  this is really a desperate act of arrogance and fake bravada to try to
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.240]  finish their takeover I think they're doing it because they know they're in
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.520]  trouble well they are in trouble and you know every time they I can guarantee you
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.560]  if they see more and more black conservatives start stepping up that
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.520]  scares the hell out of them because the commentary in this country has been
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:28.960]  for a long time for several decades that blacks tend to vote Democrat 90% yeah
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.280]  and so we have to start changing that by simply putting out the truth and the
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:40.240]  truth is the Democrat Party has done very little to help minorities in this
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:45.000]  country that was not somehow aligned to pushing their agenda and they will use
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.400]  any tactic necessary to get it done and we must I think we've got to take a few
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.600]  plays out of their playbook and start hitting back do you think though they've
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.520]  jumped the shark trying to start a localized civil war with police well
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:04.720]  you know I think when you go back and look at some of the legislation that
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.280]  has come about in past years whether it's things that have happened to the
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:15.400]  Patriot Act or NDAA you know it's scary to believe that Barack Obama has his
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:20.280]  finger on the ability to declare martial law in this country so hold on stay
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.920]  there this is bombshell because you go further than a lot of these
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.600]  constitutional sheriffs you're like Mack you know what you're talking about
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:31.320]  break down this move towards tyranny and why the Constitution is so important
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.000]  when we come back I'm gonna give you the floor so I'm gonna let you roll sir with
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.880]  just all your knowledge the situation with the execution of police around the

[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:16.600]  sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:21.080]  could include the loss of life among the restrictions Christians cannot own

[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.840]  Muslims and while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions

[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.440]  chance he's right up there as one of the front runners in a highly contested race
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:27.080]  for Harris County one of the most populous counties in the United States
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:32.880]  is Houston the third or fourth largest city now? Houston is the third if you
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.360]  look at the county itself if we took just the unincorporated part of Harris
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.680]  County we would be the fifth largest so the if you look at Harris County on a
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:49.400]  map we've got about 4.2 million people according to the last census but I think
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:54.920]  we are we are obviously continuing to grow Harris County's about the size of
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:59.200]  Rhode Island so it's a pretty big footprint Texas yeah I mean when you
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.960]  start driving south from Austin after a couple hours you hit the edge of Houston
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:06.280]  it takes an hour and a half to go through it it is just and that's if there's no
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.920]  traffic just gigantic especially since I was a kid down there visiting my dad's
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:15.560]  uncle you were interrupted by the break getting into the executive orders the
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:21.080]  power grabbing the bipartisan Patriot Act the announcements my homeland
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:25.040]  security they're not worried about Islamic terror not worried about drug
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.760]  gangs out of Mexico they're worried about veterans gun owners Christians
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.120]  conservatives these are groups statistically from the criminology as you
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.920]  know the lowest crime rate that's like saying they're worried about little old
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.360]  ladies blowing stuff up can you speak to that in your own words the new world
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.400]  order the whole nine yards and what you would do as sheriff to try to educate
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.360]  people about that well you know I really want to focus this on the office of the
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:53.120]  sheriff and I'll use an example I kind of pick on the TSA quite a bit every day
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:59.000]  in this country every day in Houston TSA breaks the law in my opinion whether
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  it's groping and doing searches that are so outside the confines of what the
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.960]  Constitution would allow but why are we doing it we're doing it because we've
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.600]  had this this story sold to us that they're doing it for our safety well to
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:20.520]  my knowledge I don't think the TSA has discovered one single terrorist however
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.640]  if we were to divert those resources being wasted in my opinion at the airport
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.520]  so the border down to the border now we just might stop some terrorists from
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:36.560]  coming into Texas and to the States but that does not fit the the storyline that
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.880]  wants to be peddled by those in Washington before the break we were
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.560]  talking about the National Defense Authorization Act now is it is it too
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:54.600]  far-fetched to believe that this racial strife that we see building in this
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.640]  country could be someone's attempt to create enough civil unrest to bring
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.200]  Barack Obama to a point to say he wants to impose martial law martial law of
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:11.520]  course for our own safety and possibly even consider suspending the
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:16.000]  upcoming elections that may be far-fetched to a lot of people but not
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.560]  too many years ago the Obamacare would have been far-fetched to think
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.040]  Americans could be forced into buying insurance so I think a lot of these
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.600]  things we have to open up our minds and understand there is an agenda happening
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:33.880]  and we don't need to wait and let this happen and try to respond to it we need
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.840]  to right now and I do mean right now do something about this because this
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:44.920]  experiment known as America if we don't is going to fail that's right America
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:47.800]  hasn't been perfect but if you study history compared to others it had some
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.000]  of the most original ideas was exceptional that's why the world started
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.400]  modeling itself after us now Obama promised to radically transform America
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.320]  and they are doing that running it in the ground I mean I remember reading six
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.080]  seven years ago that social engineering professors wanted to ban the family
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.440]  single parent homes and the word mother and father and you know don't say boy
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:15.320]  or girl they're now reprimanding kids in public schools across the country who
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:21.200]  use the word boy or girl I mean this is just I call it a cult I mean if they
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.880]  can tell us what words to use and now say boy and girl is sexist or racist or
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:32.920]  something it just shows these people are over the top there is no limit to what
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:38.720]  they will do or what they will try to do and so we must be on guard we must
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:42.880]  absolutely stand at the gate and say we're not going to let this happen folks
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:49.680]  if we lose this where do you go where do we go if we let America slip away now
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.400]  these other countries are going to let us come in and we're sure not going to
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.640]  be able to go there and get stuff for free yeah a lot of these people a lot of
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:59.600]  these countries that we give billions and billions of dollars to they don't
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.960]  like us so in in my humble opinion I think what let them not like us for free
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:10.120]  and we don't get anything that's a great idea let them not like us for free
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.000]  wow you know I want to go to some phone calls and things but I don't know if
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.960]  you've heard some of these new Black Panther Party radio shows and others
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:21.040]  where they specifically say it's time to go out start killing the white cops
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.520]  killing white people and even kill black cops of their cops and they just sit
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:32.080]  there calmly talking about this I mean if I talked like that which I wouldn't
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:39.000]  I guarantee you I mean I've had the police I've had the FBI I've had them
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.360]  here over mild stuff people said in comments that have nothing to do with
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:47.240]  me and they asked me what is your view of this and I go you were sent here
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.960]  basically by the administration you know I don't call for violence you know get
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.040]  out of here if you want a subpoena who said this go ahead and then they subpoena
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.600]  and I give them the records because I don't support people going on my website
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.360]  and you know calling for killing people and that's only happened a few times but
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.920]  I know they show up here over comments on the message board how do these groups
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.200]  get away with this because it's not free speech when you say go out and randomly
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.880]  shoots somebody in the back of the head when they're pumping gas I mean that is
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.080]  so cowardly and and then now we've got this whole race thing getting pushed so
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.360]  hard down in San Antonio two kids spear the referee in the back it could have
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:25.040]  killed him and they say well we heard him say something racist who knows if
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.960]  that's even true but it's like the race card has become this get out of jail free
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.720]  card so can you address both those well you know there are a couple things in my
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:38.560]  life that I have never bought into I don't play the race card I think it is
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.000]  ridiculous I don't buy into affirmative action to hurt one person in order to
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.280]  benefit another is exactly what the civil rights movement in this country was
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:51.240]  supposed to have been about Dr. King would absolutely have to be doing back
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:57.320]  flips in his tomb to watch some of what has been done supposedly continuing on
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:05.480]  his life's work but what we see is an absolute move to lawlessness because if
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:10.960]  we can get this thing to where there is no expectation of decency or law that
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.760]  allows people to do anything they want I look back years ago Alex I was a young
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.800]  sergeant in Southern California on the police department there in San Diego
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.800]  County when the Rodney King riots happened and it's interesting that I asked
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:31.120]  myself then how many of these people out looting and rioting in LA were out
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:35.240]  there because they were truly offended and bothered by what was done to Rodney
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:39.600]  King or how many were out there simply because it was an opportunity to behave
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:44.160]  badly and I think that's what we're seeing in this country if you want to
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.640]  handle a problem from a law enforcement standpoint for example in Baltimore the
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:54.160]  day they were going to Barry Freddie Gray the law enforcement community should
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:59.280]  have been on tactical alert in that city had I been sheriff in that county we
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.760]  would have done that I'm not going to say it wouldn't have started but I can
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.200]  guarantee you it wouldn't have lasted long you cannot play soft-handed with
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.800]  people who do not want to comply well the mayor said we wanted people to blow
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.040]  off steam and let them do it in my experience that's what makes cities
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:20.600]  burned down letting something start is what makes it happen it doesn't stop it
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:26.200]  and and that's the beauty of an elected sheriff an elected sheriff does not take
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.440]  his marching orders from the mayor and that is what we want in this city we
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:35.040]  need to get politics as far away from law enforcement and what about that mayor
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.400]  you had to like talk about arresting people that don't support lesbians or
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.240]  something I mean it's just bizarre and this lady getting arrested for not doing
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.440]  the gay marriage license I mean it's just getting weird in this country well
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:48.960]  sure down in down in Houston a mayor Parker and promoted an ordinance
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:54.760]  basically you know the hero ordinances it was called trying to create equality
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:00.200]  where there were more than enough laws and rules on the books to not have any
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:07.000]  of these folks harmed here is my point as a law enforcement officer a
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.200]  professional law enforcement officer this is my 30th year since I came into
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.720]  the business I don't care what party you're on I don't care what your
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:22.680]  lifestyle is my job is to protect and serve and to defend and protect the
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.120]  Constitution sure well I'm a libertarian I'm not even bashing those
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.080]  groups we've got barbershops getting fined because a woman walks in in
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.840]  Pittsburgh and says do my hair and they go we don't have the equipment to do
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.640]  that we just and they go that's discriminatory I mean there's nothing
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.240]  discriminatory about we do men's hair there's places only do women's hair I
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:44.640]  mean it's just getting so crazy well sure I don't know you know what's next if
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.280]  somebody has a Ford and they drive into a Chevy dealer and Chevy says we don't
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.800]  have the parts are they is that discriminatory no don't get my ideas I
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.840]  think that's true that's exactly what it is that's a great analogy yeah that's
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.560]  exactly the guy's like of course we don't cut women's hair yeah I mean a
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:07.040]  barbershop is where you go in for ten minutes you know but again this is what
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:11.280]  we see happening in this country there is such a promotion for people to do
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.520]  anything that they want and unfortunately the leadership starting in
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.760]  Washington is almost fueling this behavior you know I've often thought
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:25.760]  there must be some vapor coming off the Potomac that just makes people lose
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.000]  their minds when they go to Washington both divide and conquer yeah but here's
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.920]  my example young men throughout history want to prove their worth they want to
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.200]  fight for their tribe their country their city whatever their political
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.880]  geographic area is to prove their manhood okay I get that and people want
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:46.160]  to be adventurers they want to go off and see the world I get that too but now
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.840]  with the controlled lefts in this country the fascist left it's like they
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:53.320]  want to make their bones they want to join the military but it's like the
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.440]  leftist military they want to go signing legals up to vote give them
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.240]  driver's license they want to go run voting scams they want to go get people
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.560]  on welfare and you know you know run money laundering operations I mean it's
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:06.920]  really a lot of criminality I find in that party it's true I mean look at
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:11.040]  Akron and the rest of it and so that's how you make your bones as you find a
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.040]  barbershop you walk in and you go cut my hair put it up in rollers sorry man
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:21.360]  we don't do perms we cut men's hair and then you make your bones by suing them
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:25.720]  or or or get in the city to find them it's it's just it's just it's like they
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.080]  have something to prove you said that during the break that's why I brought
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.160]  that up you said it's like some kind of weird payback can you explain that to me
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:37.080]  well you know when you watch in if you followed the history and it's really
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:43.160]  important that we know our history folks we have many many black folks in this
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:48.800]  country who are obviously descendants of slaves and there's a lot of anger that
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:54.200]  still exists today now with here being in Texas something very important
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:01.280]  happened on the 19th of June 1865 in Galveston Texas the news arrived that
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.480]  slaves were free now if I do my math that's just over just a couple months
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:15.120]  past 150 years ago so what is the beef what is the problem for any black person
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:21.200]  today to be mad at a white person today simply based on race to try to blame
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.000]  them for something that happened 150 years ago before they were born this is
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:33.120]  the most stupid thinking I've ever seen judge people on that person do not try
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.840]  to put a blanket it's the same thought that all cops are bad that is lunacy I've
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:42.400]  been in this business a long time I know a lot of good officers I've known a few
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.600]  bad ones and what we have to do in law enforcement is make sure when we run
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:50.560]  across a bad one is we get them out of this business immediately and if that
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.880]  means we get them out via jail or prison that's okay too but we all have to
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:58.400]  follow the law that's my point that's what every sheriff in this country should
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.400]  be doing well I know your constitutionalist I love your platform and I
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:05.760]  hope you win for sheriff and I hope then you move on the state politics and be
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.040]  on because we need to stop and I'm not bashing lawyers but we don't need 90% of
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:15.160]  Congress to be lawyers we need them to be shopkeepers ranchers police officers
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.760]  former Marines you know folks like that have actually lived out there medical
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:24.360]  doctors people like that school teachers it's just we got a bunch of
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.680]  politicians up there believing their own flim flam I want to go to phone calls
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:35.040]  but getting back to the situation with the war on police do you agree with
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:40.440]  sheriff David Clark of Milwaukee County up in Wisconsin that that this war on
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:45.240]  police has been launched by Obama I believe that Obama has played a huge
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:51.440]  part in this because he has stood so silent when something happens in the
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.120]  black community whether it was the Trayvon Martin issue that really didn't
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:00.320]  have direct police involvement or it was the Ferguson incident the New York
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:05.240]  incident the Baltimore incident he is in the rose garden given speeches and
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:14.640]  somehow a man that I knew in Harris County Texas was executed executed and
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.120]  it took the president three and a half four days to make a private phone call
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:25.600]  to the widow nothing no press conference no I didn't humanizing no it was it was
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:31.520]  business as usual while I think he was flying to Alaska to rename Mount McKinley
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:39.840]  that's how important it was that is embarrassing that that's hurtful police
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:45.280]  officers guard the gate folks and if you don't think it's so imagine for a
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.880]  moment that 911 calls went unanswered nobody showed up you would quickly find
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.880]  out who's more important to police officers or Barack Obama well I'll
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:00.400]  say this the Democratic Party can't try to take our guns and then have a war on
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:05.200]  police it just shows a pure criminal communist instinct and I mean you really
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:09.320]  get down to it that's who they are I never believed General Parton I thought
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.600]  he was right about most of it and all their top experts saying it's communist
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:16.240]  it's communist it's communist it's not just an ideology they use they plant it
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:22.040]  and they just that's what they're into it's insane it's dangerous finally that
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:25.800]  I'm gonna go to calls here I'm gonna skip this network break I'm only one today
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:34.720]  try to be a good boy but you talked about it earlier if we don't stop this
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:40.680]  what are the people going to do that have bought into this system when all the
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:44.320]  freebies are cut off because that's what the vegetarians do they have a phase
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:48.200]  where they hand everything out for free but then they take it all away is the
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.480]  public so dumb that's gone along with this that if this all falls apart they'll
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:56.640]  never even know what hit him a great many of them yes I hate to use the word
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:01.600]  dumb but if you're not willing to educate yourself with what's going on
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.480]  you could be left in the dark and I think a great many people in this country
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:12.440]  are in for one heck of a shock when the free stuff stops I've never been
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:15.600]  anti-police but I've been on air 20 years I saw the development of the
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.640]  police state the end of the Constitution which came from the central
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:21.520]  government I wasn't against police themselves I was against the move
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:26.280]  towards the solitarianism and we always said they'll then scapegoat the police
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.280]  before they really dropped the hammer that that's always done in every other
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.200]  country whether it be fascist or communist it follows pretty much a formula
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.920]  but the reason I've really reached out to police the last five or six years was
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:40.840]  they reached out to me or I experienced it with veterans active duty and police
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:45.440]  veterans are the most away then police after that whether they be federal or
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.720]  local that's why they want to have a war with police is because the globalists
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.880]  realize the most await group is the police and military I've experienced that
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.760]  have you experienced that that behind closed doors the police really compared
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.600]  to the public I talked to cops I mean they're super awake compared to the
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:07.800]  public about how stuff works who's behind things what's going on as we can
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.160]  bash cops all day but I just discovered they're one of the most await groups to
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.820]  the New World Order conspiracy well you know we have to be Alex you know we
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:21.840]  live this stuff I mean the streets are not exactly a safe place and so if
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:27.240]  police officers are not paying attention to their surroundings that's when we die
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:34.400]  and we have to get better at doing what we're doing we have to get much more in
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:39.920]  tune with everything happening around us so you know one point I wanted to make
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:45.160]  you brought up the military and I'm sure you I'm sure you've covered this if you
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.520]  look at what Barack Obama has done by getting rid of all of the senior
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:56.080]  military officers and I believe there is a very very clear reason why if you
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:00.800]  look at the oath taken by an enlisted member of the service versus the oath
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:07.280]  taken by an officer in the service the officers take no oath to the commander in
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:11.360]  chief it's only to the Constitution so to get rid of these senior officers is
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.280]  very important if you can bring in your own flunkies I'll call them that will do
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:20.440]  what you want so I think it is very telling to me that some of these very
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.920]  very senior decorated generals and admirals have been expelled from the
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.960]  server get rid of combat vets I notice they put a lot of Harvard pencil
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:34.520]  pushers whenever in combat as top people yes and again you know you look at this
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:39.400]  move that they want to promote taking guns away second amendment rights away
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.520]  from veterans why do you think that is you know I think it's because well if
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:48.160]  you've been to combat it's probably a pretty good chance that your ability to
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:52.800]  defend yourself with a weapon made you pretty proficient at it so don't fall
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.320]  for this thing about that guns are bad and guns kill people bad people kill
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:02.400]  people and you know I can lay my weapon on this desk it'll sit here for into the
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:06.400]  next millennium and not gonna harm a soul it's gonna take an evil heart to do
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.480]  it so this push to get guns they can't get the guns you know you've seen a DHS
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:16.040]  buying more ammunition than the military has what could that possibly be for if
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:21.600]  not to possibly be used against us oh they admit that's what it's for and it's
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:25.880]  so creepy that it's all happening and we just see it progressing and it's
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:30.800]  crazier by the minute I just hope that the bureaucrats up there and then the
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.960]  socialist professors that think they're running this show I hope they realize if
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.360]  they actually start this they're not gonna win it and believe me I don't want
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.440]  it to start I don't have any you know delusions of grandeur I just don't think
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:44.920]  they are really tuned in to what a true civil war in this country is gonna look
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:52.080]  like you know Americans are we're a unique bunch because when you say
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:56.320]  American what do you think about do you think about a particular color no you
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:01.200]  think about an ideology we're a people from everywhere that have come here and
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:06.880]  call this place home and so we're pretty protective of this place and the thing
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:11.440]  that holds it all together is our founding documents and that is why we
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:17.040]  must do everything necessary to protect those documents and anybody who steps
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:22.000]  into office who does not uphold that oath that they take that needs to be a
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.200]  criminal offense because it's bait and switch and it's the most dangerous kind
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:29.440]  absolutely let's go to calls the next six minutes and five more minutes with
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.120]  our guests and we're gonna have Ted Newsion on it eight after next hour
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:36.800]  he's impressive Carl Pittman he needs to be on table news he needs to get
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:40.080]  financial support we need to put him in a sheriff you want to fight the New World
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:43.480]  Order folks you got to get down in the trenches getting this guy elected a
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:48.040]  sheriff over Harris County is a big win that's four plus million people they'll
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:52.080]  have a constitutionalist in there and not a bunch of crazy totalitarians because
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.280]  battleground Texas the left is trying to take Houston over right now and I mean
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:01.160]  they mean business folks let's go ahead and I don't know who to go to first here
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:07.920]  let's go to Ned Ned you're on the air go ahead yeah I just want to applaud
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.160]  Sheriff Pittman I think that he epitomizes what all sheriff should be
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.320]  like I live here in FEMA region 10 Southern Oregon and we've got a new
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:23.760]  black sheriff here who is really good too I I I one thing I'm really upset as
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:27.560]  you know this gun issue is so strange because there are millions and millions
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:31.640]  of guns that aren't registered and it's like this is just such a joke and in
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:37.800]  this state here the the communist socialist governor here is passed the law
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:43.040]  through illegally through the legislature saying that though everybody
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.200]  here in this state has to register with the federal government that's so they
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:50.880]  can come after exactly even though it's not a law that's constitutional so they
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:55.200]  can have a persecution of gun owners that's right and it's also ammunition
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.760]  they're doing the ammunition thing too I know they're coming for the guns look
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:04.640]  how about this deputy Pittman they came out and announced as you know outside of
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.120]  law they're gonna apply this algorithm that the VA has to everybody on social
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:13.000]  security that the FBI said if you're getting your your your check wired to
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.280]  you that means you're financially inept and so you're gonna be declared inept
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.520]  and lose your guns I mean that's crazy well you know that example played out
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.840]  here in the United States not too long ago and strangely enough in support of
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.560]  exactly what I'm talking about the sheriff of that county with others stood
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.800]  and protected that veterans right that was in Oregon too no no Washington yeah
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:39.640]  and so that's just important it goes to tell you all the things we're worried
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.840]  about if we can truly get good constitutional sheriffs in as many
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.320]  counties in the United States as we can we can stop a lot of these government
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.160]  overreaches sure we always hear about a police state it's aimed at everybody
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.240]  just to collect revenue and all the rest of it I'm against that but that's not the
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:56:00.360]  average cop I'm surprised people haven't I'm surprised the police response and
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:03.880]  their restraint not going after people on radio saying it's time to go out and
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:09.120]  kill cops I mean if somebody says something about my family or my crew go
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:12.280]  out and kill them I would start I would have trouble controlling myself well
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:17.960]  but that's why we are professional law enforcement officers if we go out and we
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:23.400]  begin to break the law we are no better than those that we are trying to to
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:28.440]  deal with so you know we have to maintain restraint what we need to do now is look
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:32.600]  at and readjust our tactics and procedures and how we do our business
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:39.800]  but you know if you decide that you want to engage yourself in a conflict with
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.680]  law enforcement in this country and I can tell you when elected sheriff of
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:46.800]  Harris County if you decide that that's what you want to do in Harris County and
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:51.920]  I truly hope you don't we're gonna make it an absolute point that you lose well
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.280]  I mean I lose fair calm we're talking on the show and I don't want to get in a
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.120]  fight with him but some of these other groups they talk about having a war and
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:02.600]  like winning nobody's gonna win this it's gonna be horrible yes yes we don't
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.960]  need that but there are some people that are they have a foregone conclusion
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:13.480]  that they are trying to push this thing to some sort of armed conflict and that's
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:16.600]  a dangerous thing for everybody that's because they're politically not gonna
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:21.840]  win they want to turn up as a chessboard let's talk to Brandon and Brandon now
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:26.440]  what state are you calling in from Virginia go ahead sir you're on the air
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.120]  we got about a minute and a half in this segment all right I wanted to start by
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:37.360]  getting seeing your deputy pit mink gives his take on urban warfare
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:42.760]  warfare drill it seems like up here in Richmond that they happen almost every
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:48.160]  week and these drills are just they're the normal people that'll be the enemy
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.960]  whether it's pro-life or 9-11 truth there's people protesting you're saying
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:55.400]  you're a marine reservist I see that on screen we have it in the news that they
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:59.120]  are training to take on veterans and gun owners they have the Marines training
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.120]  for that I have video of it thank you for the call it's a great question what
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:05.560]  do you make of this open buildup you alluded to it earlier for a war with
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:11.680]  veterans well you know I like to believe that I can speak only for myself that
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:15.400]  oath I took many years ago to protect and defend the Constitution means just
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:20.200]  that did not die when I left the Marine Corps and it is very similar to the oath
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.320]  that I took when I came into law enforcement so you know I'm not going
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:28.000]  to tell you that there might not be some officers out there that would behave
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.800]  badly I'm not gonna tell you there might not be some members of the military
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:35.280]  but I have a lot of faith in the folks that that absolutely flag that they'll
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:38.320]  do the right thing I think it's gonna backlash they ordered on confiscation I
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:41.880]  think it's gonna be big because there was a fuselage and contrainer doing we said we heard about it

[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.320]  under Mexican control now with the narcos thank you for the call I want to
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:26.240]  give sheriff's deputy a chance to respond what is your view of the
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:31.760]  oath keepers well again anyone who has taken that oath and is going to follow
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:37.440]  it more importantly we can absolutely not participate in any action in
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:43.760]  violation of the Constitution against the citizens of this nation period there
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:48.200]  are no what ifs there's no buts but we just can't do that because every time
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:54.320]  we start to negotiate those things away we lose more and more so I commend
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.080]  oath keepers for doing that I'm not a member of oath keepers but I am an
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:02.760]  oath keeper also because it's my oath I am a member of the Constitutional
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:06.200]  Sheriff's and Peace Officers Association that was founded by my good friend
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:10.400]  Richard Mack absolutely and again we're doing Facebook mentions right now some

[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.480]  the county not just counting the city so the county's the fifth largest
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:24.760]  jurisdiction of people in the United States really exciting to see Constitutional
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.760]  is running and winning across the country I want to jam in one quick call
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:32.560]  from Robert in Missouri real quick what's your point sir and we'll get the
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:38.040]  sheriff's deputy's response well yeah I'm a former Marine too I was locked and
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:42.920]  loaded on a five ton at Camp Las Vegas when the whole Rodney King went down at
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:47.720]  at Camp Pendleton there and so and I and I was you know I live a stone's throw
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.520]  from Ferguson I'm here at St. Louis they've stripped the sheriff's in my area
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.600]  of their powers now you have police chiefs in both St. Louis County that's a
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:59.920]  great question hate to cut you off but I gotta get a response what about this
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:03.960]  federal globalist move to get rid of sheriff's and and merge the departments
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.880]  how do you get rid of a state charter that the sheriff selected I mean that's
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:13.080]  insane well the only way that's gonna happen is the legislators in your state
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:17.520]  have allowed this to happen that is the simple answer the sheriff here in
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:22.080]  Texas is a constitutional office which means it is required to exist by our
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:25.920]  state constitution yeah get rid of the legislature next yeah it will whatever
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:30.920]  but I tell you what will happen again we're watching this continued erosion
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:35.600]  of our country and there are people that have some bad intentions for us well
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:39.400]  it's like TPP and all these globalist treaties that circumvent Congress you
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:42.200]  get rid of the sheriff get rid of the governor get rid of Congress just just
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:46.880]  make George Soros God sheriff I'm gonna be supporting you for winning that great
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:50.400]  job God bless you yes sir we got your buddy Ted Nugent coming up here in just
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:54.200]  a moment so thank you so much thank you he's too busy even staying up lunch was
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:59.680]  gonna run back to work down in down in Houston we'll be right back over the
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:04.360]  Labor Day weekend we had reports of eight being killed and 46 being wounded
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:09.840]  July 4th of this year we had reports of nine dead in 53 wounded and let us not
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:15.320]  forget July 4th of last year we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot and
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:19.880]  these are not nationwide stats all of these numbers come from the city of
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:24.720]  Chicago the city with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation which
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:29.040]  is to say if criminals expect you to be unarmed they're more likely to attack
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.960]  you not to mention the fact that much of this violence is linked to gangs or
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:37.440]  drug activity meaning that for all the gun buybacks and anti-gun
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.360]  commercials criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms and I
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:45.840]  understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:49.720]  every place at once but that's why you have a second amendment so you'll be

[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:54.200]  changer now joining us joining us via the telephone is the one the only NRA
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:12:01.960]  board member multi-platinum artist the Motor City Madman transplanted down here
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:08.000]  to Texas and we love it that's Ted Nugent and we just had on Deputy Pittman
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.040]  who he's endorsed for Sheriff Don Harris County on with us as we fight to take
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:17.600]  back our local governments and to defend the Second Amendment but the reason Ted
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:23.120]  Nugent is joining us TedNugent.com is I was aware of this a few years ago but I
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.720]  wasn't aware of how widespread it was I have a lot of friends with History
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:32.280]  Channel and Discovery Channel shows I myself host several shows on History
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.120]  Channel and Discovery Channel dealing with unsolved mysteries America's book
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:42.640]  of secrets been a guest host of Brad Metzler's show on America's secrets as
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.960]  well I mean I'm on currently five shows on History and Discovery I can't talk
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:53.240]  about inside baseball because you have to sign basically non-disclosures when
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:57.960]  you're part of these shows but I've been part of gun shows that were produced
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:03.760]  back when Sandy Hook happened and they know the hottest shows on History and
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:10.000]  Discovery hands down are stuff like Duck Dynasty which is of course on A&E I was
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.080]  also offered and I know that some top folks are involved in it in a show to
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:22.680]  replace Duck Dynasty so they know that is the top show on any channel A&E I
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:29.000]  don't care what it is you want popular libertarian constitutional you know John
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.600]  Wayne guns rock and roll freedom it's what America is everybody watches it
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.800]  black white Hispanic liberal conservative and I know and we're going to
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:42.560]  Ted News in here in a moment but he just joined us I know what he's saying is true
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:47.800]  because I have experienced it with a whole separate show that they wanted me
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:52.160]  to host and I said I think this will be canceled I've seen it before I'll be a
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.080]  guest and if it gets picked up then I'll be a regular on it because I'm too
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:02.320]  busy and sure enough they shot a TV show for one of these networks of high
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:06.560]  powered guns you name it stuff blowing up cars jumping things I mean super
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:12.240]  exciting and guess what they didn't air it even though it costs four million
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:16.800]  dollars to film six episodes okay so I'm giving you some inside baseball I'm not
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.920]  gonna say any more because I don't want to get sued now Verizon TV drops the
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:26.640]  sportsman channel their most popular channel and Ted Nugent is exposing it
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.600]  this is part of killing the culture I have a London Telegraph article the New
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:35.960]  James Bond is lectured in the new novels and not that this movie but the next by
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:39.720]  women and quote gaze the whole time well I'm not against women and gaze the point
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:45.000]  is everything is a socialist brainwashing message now and so if they
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  can't beat you they just shut you off see you you don't get ratings them to come
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.560]  the top show you get ratings you get thrown off TV or you get swat teamed
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:57.960]  like Ted Nugent has when he does his shoots by local socialist so I'm gonna
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:01.800]  shut up now and give him the floor and skip this network break I can't help it
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:06.040]  joining us is Ted Nugent to break down but some of this but I wanted to give
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:11.160]  you some background here that I have experienced this and others I know have
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:16.640]  experienced it that they don't want libertarian or pro-american messages or
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:22.120]  conservative messages on television even though it's a big hit Ted Nugent am I
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:26.960]  accurate absolutely Alex I bring you a freedom drenched and freedom threatened
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:31.400]  greetings from the beautiful hill country of Texas and I'd just like to
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:37.720]  shout out loud and proud Hillary for prison 2016 absolutely brother you you
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:42.640]  did you get it gave a wonderful as always accurate background to one of the
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:48.920]  issues I mean my god Alex the the number of freedom abusing freedom
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:53.120]  destroying fundamental transformation abuse of power and corruption and
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:58.520]  fraud and deceit and anti-americanism that runs a muck in this country from the
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:04.760]  president on down it breaks the hearts of good Americans by the hour across this
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:10.040]  country so the main point of my phone call today obviously I'm high on elk
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:14.600]  meat right now because my son I just got back from Colorado where I'm
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:20.600]  celebrating the natural instinct of the hunting season but I have to earn that
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:27.160]  joy and that positive that buoyancy that American you know we the people dream I
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:32.080]  have to earn it by exposing the bad and the ugly if you do every day in order to
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:37.520]  celebrate as much good as possible what what Verizon has done is they have taken
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:42.160]  the sportsman's channel that has more than three times what I understand many
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:47.400]  many times the radiance of shall we say Al Jazeera boy there's a real pro
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:53.520]  American pro freedom boy if I ever squashed one and Verizon has canceled
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:59.320]  sportsman's channel which is just a pure honest down-to-earth nature God's
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:05.040]  creation celebration of the natural hunting season that culminates with
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:10.480]  Thanksgiving where hundreds of millions of Americans they thank you God for your
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:15.800]  renewable pantry of life-sustaining wildlife protein and obviously there's
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:21.280]  there's other natural resources but when Verizon cancels the sportsman's channel
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:28.320]  it's a direct result of the anti-gun anti-freedom anti-hunting anti-wild life
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:35.480]  anti-science anti-Americanism that is infested our media across this land and
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:39.880]  I hope people will visit my Facebook which by the way Alex I mean I'm just a
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:45.160]  goofy guitar player and not only wrote wango tango I actually believed it I
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:53.400]  sent records with 33.6 million Facebookers often on for the last four
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:58.640]  months currently I'm down to 22 million Facebookers but the point is is that what
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:04.480]  Alex Jones but what you represent what working hard playing hard Americans
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:10.480]  represent what the great Carl Pittman represents what the NRA represents what
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:16.000]  Ted Nugent represents isn't individual presumptions or hunches it's self
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:21.160]  evident truth and it's alive and well across this country so if people want
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:28.160]  to celebrate self-evident truth logic common sense science irrefutable evidence
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:32.920]  they should visit my website TedNugent.com and certainly my Facebook which
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:38.000]  I'm on in between every morning and afternoon hunting adventure and I
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.800]  communicate with people that are not just like minded with me they're like
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.640]  minded with truth they're like minded that that America's fundamental
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:53.320]  transformation is an engineered train wreck of the only experiment self
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:58.000]  government in the history of the world and what Verizon has done by canceling
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.120]  sportsman channel is they've just given the toxic middle finger of communism
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:08.440]  anti-Americanism to the conservation communities and the conservation
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:12.320]  families of this country and it's another example of you can keep your
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:16.600]  doctor if you want to what difference does it make that for Americans were
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:21.360]  killed because our government refused to provide enough security in a dangerous
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:25.800]  area and where lowest learner complete the fifth and go off with a bonus live
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:31.240]  life live happily ever after while he intentionally and in demonically destroyed
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:38.160]  other people's lives with the power of the IRS you've got to be kidding me Ted
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:41.840]  Nugent he's on fire and you know I forgot earlier in my rant to tell the
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:45.360]  kicker I'm sitting around in LA as I know you've done countless times and
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.920]  they're pitching these TV shows they're talking about the one that just got
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:51.480]  canceled and I'm sitting there talking to one of the heads of one of these major
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:59.280]  reality TV production shows and he said listen he said all they want is guns and
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.840]  Americana and John Wayne and he said Ted Nugent he said that's what everybody
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:08.360]  wants and the people up above at the networks are panicking they're saying
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:14.040]  these libertarians these conservatives these these crazies are taking over the
[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:17.760]  bitter clingers are taking over I'm having this repeated to me so no matter if
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:22.880]  it kills these networks we've got to shut all this down so I guess you're the
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:26.880]  last of all because they will not produce gun shows now they will not produce
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:31.320]  hunting shows now it's a beautiful thing in this I know you love me Alex I feel
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:35.120]  the love but you know but the real reason you you don't even know the real
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:39.480]  reason you love me and the real reason is because Ted Nugent's spirit of the
[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:44.200]  wild has been the number one hunting show in the history of the world for 24
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:49.200]  years on our channel even though everything I say everything I do
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:54.760]  everything I show everything I celebrate with maximum enthusiasm on Ted Nugent's
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:21:01.960]  spirit of the wild every week for the last 24 years drives the liberals back
[02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:06.360]  no I know so they would destroy themselves they hate that I celebrate
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:11.080]  firepower they hate that I celebrate self-defense they hate that I celebrate
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:15.600]  backstrips and venison and renewable protein but they can't mess with it
[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:21.120]  because my ratings crush them so they've got to cancel it outright which now
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:23.440]  you'll just do your own thing or go somewhere else that's what I'm saying is
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:27.400]  this desperate attempt at censorship and banning the word father and mother and
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:31.600]  boy and girl and they're doing it in schools is this their death rattle
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:36.840]  because it's just it's to see these totalitarian control freaks writhing
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:42.080]  around so angry that my show is popular so angry that you're so popular so
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:46.720]  angry they can't control us where do you see all this and now Obama openly
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:50.680]  trying to have a war on police with his operatives going around saying kill
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:55.000]  police and Sheriff Clark coming out saying Obama is waging a war on police
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:01.440]  what are they thinking well you you know your your question is based on your
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:06.040]  demand for logic you your logical mind we have to get up in the morning every
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:10.320]  day we have to be productive we have to have a semblance of personal hygiene and
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:16.720]  in spite of what Michael Moore preaches we have to be positive assets to
[02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:20.560]  ourselves our families our neighborhoods our country our fellow man the good
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:25.280]  mother earth we are driven to do this and everybody I know does and is but
[02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:32.400]  when you start asking why would Hillary Clinton not be in jail the logic
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:39.000]  probes in your brain will start to fall because why is lowest learner not in
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:48.800]  jail why is Eric Holder not in jail why is Barack Obama not in jail you got to
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:55.600]  be kidding me why is Wendy Davis not in jail why is Wasserman Schultz not in
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:23:01.680]  jail if it's because the liberal government abuse the liberal media
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:08.520]  dishonesty and the propaganda ministry known as academia in America today the
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:15.000]  big tri-power of anti-Americanism government media and academia they've
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:20.400]  got so many Americans in a stranglehold God would a great song 40 years later
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:26.760]  anyhow those that allow themselves to be brainwashed those that allow themselves
[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:31.200]  to be in a stranglehold they're getting what they deserve but those of us who
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:35.400]  are driven to be as productive as possible to be as positive as possible
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:42.520]  to be as law-abiding as possible our heart we cry tears of blood Alex when
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:51.760]  we see a mural in New York that says save a life kill a cop this is the devil
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:57.240]  at work and the devil's got voices and he comes from Barack Obama where he
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:03.480]  sides with black thugs every time and always manages to make a disparaging
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:10.080]  negative even hateful remark about law enforcement when when will Wilson and
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:16.920]  St. Louis defended his life from being attacked by a monster thug Michael
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:24.160]  Brown and then Obama sends in his so-called Department of Justice with
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:29.320]  the so-called Attorney General Eric Holder at the time to investigate Darren
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:34.760]  Wilson instead of looking at the videotape that the dog asked for it
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:39.120]  well Ted let me ask you this question meets the cuckoo's nest and good
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:46.320]  logical honest hard-working Americans are that Hillary Clinton would be allowed
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:50.840]  to run for any office from dog catcher to the president of the United States
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:56.560]  because he's a liar he's a scam artist and she is broken federal law after
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:02.480]  federal law after federal law going all the way back to the cattle future scam
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:06.520]  and Arkansas it's incredible claiming that we don't need security and Benghazi
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:11.400]  to get her emails of her own person look at fast and furious let me let me ask
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:16.000]  you this what is the end game because it's a bold move through Soros through
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.760]  the Justice Department through Nancy Pelosi with her staff members running
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:26.320]  Black Lives Matter it's been confirmed it's run out of White House groups what
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.760]  do they hope to get causing a local civil war and taking angst and focusing on
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:35.600]  random cops shooting them in the back of the head how do they think that's going
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:40.120]  to get them power are they trying to start a civil war so Obama can declare a
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:44.600]  civil emergency you're a smart guy an entrepreneur not just a great musician in
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:49.960]  your gut what what is your spidey sense of Ted Nugent you know the Tarzan of
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:54.800]  North America what do you think's going on what do you think he's planning in
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:01.120]  his last year and a half and in office well it's clear just a cursory review
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:07.480]  of the Barack Obama heritage proves that he was influenced raised and brainwashed
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:13.840]  overwhelmingly by the Frank David Marshall David Marshall David Marshall Davis
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:18.600]  the weatherman all of them the Saul of Linsky's and the Cloward Pivens and his
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:26.240]  his his entire gang in the White House right now he is he's a communist and
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:29.080]  every time somebody would say something like that including me
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:35.280]  racist this and racist that and and extremists and radical and hater I'm
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:44.440]  not a hater I love freedom but I do hate slavery I do hate criminality I do hate
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:50.400]  communism I I despise people that would take the greatest quality of life in the
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:55.640]  history of the world which Barack Obama is doing his fundamental transformation
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:01.480]  spraying the urines around a little bit his social justice which is such a joke
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:06.600]  his income equality which is such but it's not even that I mean look at
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:13.960]  Obamacare is a giant scam raping poor people absolutely the people that vote
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:19.640]  for him are getting it in the ass more than anybody if it's I sit back and I
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:24.520]  go you know Alfred E Newman would not have published this in Mad magazine
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:30.160]  because it's not funny it's stupid it's sick and it's a cruel so I think the
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:36.200]  answer your question even though logic has no role in the review of Barack
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:42.480]  Obama or the liberal Democrats or any of these lying scam artists the end game
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:48.880]  is that they believe if you work hard you're cheating they think if you save
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:54.400]  for a rainy day you're cheating now nobody can explain why they think that
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.760]  unless you have been completely brainwashed in the mouthache tongue
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:06.920]  Karl Marx Barack Obama agenda that we're all cheap and no matter whether you
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:12.280]  don't try or you try really hard you should get the same bowl of rice and
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:18.840]  that is anti human I totally agree with you there was a famous Trotsky I had who
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:22.200]  wrote a book I'm gonna pull it up in a moment back in the 50s that's where we
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:27.560]  get the term that liberalism is a mental illness of self-hating of wanting to
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:31.400]  overthrow things but of wanting to control other people it creates nightmares
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:35.760]  everywhere but Thomas Jefferson was a true Renaissance liberal meaning more
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:40.080]  freedom these people today we use the term liberal because that's the term
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:45.520]  people know but Ted Cruz calls them fascist liberals I just call them a
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:51.520]  cult of freaks with a bunch of dumbed-down idiots following them who then
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:55.840]  hate everyone who's got more than they do not understanding that more wealth
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:00.760]  means war more wealth for everybody I mean I just don't know where it's going
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:06.280]  when you got a hundred million people on government assistance I mean what are
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:09.400]  they gonna do when they shut down all the producers it's like France has an
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:14.160]  84% tax rate they're collapsing and their answer is more taxes then turns out
[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:17.920]  the Socialist Party's exempt Ted Nugent's our guest we're gonna come back and let

[02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:08.240]  reported by WorldNet Daily ISIS terrorists gather together dozens of
[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:12.480]  Christian men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.560]  sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that
[02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:21.040]  could include the loss of life among the restrictions Christians cannot own

[02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:30.400]  bells the terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that
[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:34.520]  used to be dominated by the Christian faith but has been taken over by radical
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:39.600]  Muslims and while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions numerous
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:44.320]  people in power continue to fund groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda whether it's
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:48.360]  air-dropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles

[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:13.480]  here I come now baby frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's
[02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:20.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network it is a distinct pleasure to play
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:25.280]  Stranglehold one of my all-time favorite songs remember going to see Ted
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:31.040]  Nugent in high school in Dallas when he was packing out crowds of 50,000 people
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:36.320]  and now here he is on the radio with us and I like Ted I love Ted Nugent because
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:41.080]  he's on a coward he tells it like it is that's why he's successful
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:45.600]  by Donald Trump successful people are sick of milk toast they're sick of
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:49.760]  things being watered down so one thing they do is they misrepresent what we
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:55.240]  say and what we do I pointed out that our government had funded al-Qaeda and it
[02:33:55.240 --> 02:33:59.240]  allowed them to operate now they're doing it in Syria now they're turning them
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:03.000]  loose all over the world calling them ISIS criminals in our government and the
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.240]  media spends it oh I'm saying that you know our government had bombs in the
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:10.720]  buildings and ran the whole deal no I'm not I'm saying criminals in our
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:15.640]  government are allied with radical Islam and Saudi Arabia and allowing it to
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:20.200]  take over and I've been vindicated now as the 28 pages I've had Congressman
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:25.400]  Jones on I played clips of Senator Graham who've read it ran Paul's come on
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:31.440]  and talk about it it says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks and then basically they
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:34.960]  covered it up because they didn't want that info out and that's a whole separate
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:41.120]  area but now we have Obama trying to block Russia putting aircraft in Syria to
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.720]  battle ISIS so it's incredible I want to ask Ted Nugent about that I want to
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:49.960]  ask Ted Nugent about moves to restrict deer hunting in Texas moves to kill
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:55.320]  private herds on people's own property I want to get into what he thinks Obama's
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:59.000]  gonna do before he leaves office this move to block Social Security recipients
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:04.600]  from owning guns applying the system they use at the VA to restrict veterans
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:09.600]  owning guns this is the last year and a half of this and they're gonna go for
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:15.880]  broke and Ted Nugent joins us to cover the waterfront but listen it's a big
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:22.760]  deal that Verizon has dropped their top channel aired nationwide the sportsman
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:26.640]  channel they're not even talking about you know re-airing this stuff they're
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:32.080]  just talking about killing it and and I've been in the boardroom meetings not
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:35.800]  with this this folks but with all the others but I mean you name it when I
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:41.200]  say all the others I mean history channel discovery channel A&E to the
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:45.960]  point of when they call me up want me to host some show I just go no because I've
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:50.480]  produced three of them they get killed I mean I've been in them I mean I've got
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:55.840]  I'm not just saying that I've got I am the host on five shows on cable TV right
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:03.440]  now okay some of them you know top on their channels and I won't be part of
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:07.360]  it now because they censor so much they restrict or they just don't let the show
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:12.560]  on because again our culture of America is sexy people want and I'm ranting
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.600]  here Ted Nugent comms the website Ted Nugent joins us Ted just getting back
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:20.240]  to this briefing that will cover the waterfront take some calls and you can
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:23.480]  cover all these other issues but until it's the next shoot a drop in your view
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:31.560]  but how do we protest this do we drop Verizon phones do we call them or do we
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:36.880]  just support where the channel goes or other pro-gun type programming I mean
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:43.680]  how do we respond to them basically it'd be like if you're a NASCAR champion
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:47.440]  they just blow your car up right when the green light turns on I mean they're
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:51.000]  just not letting us on the racetrack how do we respond to this type of
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.400]  rigging stuff well it's great that you ask how we respond because I think the
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:01.160]  the real curse the self-inflicted scourge in america day isn't necessarily
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:06.080]  the line scam artists of a barack Obama and Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton at
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:15.240]  all the real horror the real engineered self-inflicted suicide of the
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:22.040]  American dream came from none other than we the people we the people who failed
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.920]  to realize that in order to earn us an experiment self-government in order to
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:34.600]  earn your American dream we the people have a daily responsibility to function
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:39.560]  and actually participate in this sacred and unique experiment self-government by
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:46.720]  putting pressure polite yet pressure on our elected employees admitting that
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:53.320]  they are indeed our elected employees and in the absence of we the people
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:58.920]  pressure we the people monitoring and demanding i.e. the tea parties I mean the
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:03.360]  tea party is demonized because we the people demanded accountability from
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:08.000]  our elected employees you can't get any sicker than that but the real guilt
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:13.320]  rests on those Americans who do not call their senator do not call their
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:17.920]  congressman do not communicate with their mayor and their governor the real
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:25.480]  guilt is the apathy and the sheep-like misbehavior of so many Americans that
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:30.680]  will fall for the hands-up don't shoot lie and they may as well just say bend
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:37.240]  over don't spank it's all a lie and it's a direct result of so many people in
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:44.400]  America not giving a damn about using the freedoms that the military heroes
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:50.200]  have provided it's such great cost and sacrifice so that we can earn our own
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:57.920]  way we can keep what we earn and we can inspire others to earn their own way by
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:05.840]  not in slaving them with handouts and the welfare boogie so the right now for
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.680]  example you played stranglehold stranglehold I wrote 41 years ago it's
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:15.360]  celebrated our 40th year of my first solo album where everybody in the music
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:19.600]  business Alex told me well you know Ted the feedback guitar that's like that's
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:24.040]  not cool anymore and and you'll need a keyboard and you'll need some pop song
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:28.480]  you need to have a pop song you need some background singers and you need more
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:33.840]  harmony and I said I I can't see on the Alex George radio show what I said but
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:38.760]  it was a Detroit colloquialism that is a basic door slamming in your face and I
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:43.480]  continued to make the music that the people that I played 350 nights a year
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:48.600]  in front of responded to enthusiastically and when I travel today
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:55.120]  it's not just a stranglehold musical statement it's a stranglehold I stand up
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:00.000]  for what I believe in I still believe in the American dream I still believe in
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.600]  the US Constitution the Bill of Rights and the Golden Rule the 10 Commandments
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:11.000]  and it is alive and well across this country but because at least 55% of
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:19.160]  Americans don't give a damn we've got a gang we got criminals running our
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:24.880]  government our media and our academia and they do not reflect the positive
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:29.400]  law-abiding spirit of good Americans everywhere you come to my Facebook with
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:35.040]  22 and a half million people you get the occasional freak if a good word that
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:37.800]  you choose they are freaks if you don't think
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:43.160]  benefit is food you're a freak if you don't think Thanksgiving is celebrating
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:49.600]  the annual harvest of billions and billions of renewable wildlife resources
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:54.280]  you're a freak if you don't believe in the right to keep and bear arms and the
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:41:00.000]  instinct to self-defense you're a freak absolutely immediately moved to Cuba
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:06.400]  where all your freak ideas are already policy Ted Nugent so this is not a Ted
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:10.520]  Hunter and Alex Hunter it's a we the people reality and if you're not
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:15.000]  involved in this experiment self-government you're a punk something I've
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.440]  been saying for 20 years that I now want to basically amend is that I would
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:22.280]  always explain to people look the second of them it's about the right to keep
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:26.200]  and bear arms defend us from a tyrannical government or from thugs or
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:29.960]  criminals everybody would obsess about hunting and our rights to hunting but
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:34.600]  now I get it exactly and of course that's something we sell at times it's
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:38.200]  true but I get why they're trying to restrict hunting while they're trying
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:42.120]  to demonize it while they banned it most areas of Europe in the UK is because
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:47.520]  that is a normal human culture and a normal human instinct and it's very
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:51.320]  enlightening and empowering and you get high from it because it's something
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:54.800]  you're meant to do like a dog gets excited when it chases a rabbit we're
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:59.680]  meant to be hunters it's it's a bonding experience for men and women they're
[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:04.040]  trying to kill our culture so it is about hunting even though the Second
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:08.560]  Amendment isn't hunting supports it and supports the Second Amendment that's
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:12.240]  why we've got to defend it but I look absolutely correct you can hear all the
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:16.680]  liberal anti gunners and anti-freedom freaks every time they bring up gun
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:22.360]  rights they always reference well if you have a gun that's proper for sporting
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:27.240]  purposes we can see the ownership of sporting purpose firearms but wait a
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:32.600]  minute as if our founding fathers were worried about sport after they left the
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:37.800]  tyranny of King George they had the war over not turning the guns in I mean the
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:40.160]  war was over them coming for the guns that's my next question
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:43.760]  sure Obama says he's gonna use executive action to come out for the guns
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:46.640]  they're already doing it all over the country under the table going out
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:50.240]  for Social Security recipients guns I mean that's mainstream news we broke
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.960]  that people didn't believe it till Fox News added a week later they may push
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:59.280]  too far they clearly want to start a civil war how do we walk that line not
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:03.040]  let them push us into violence but at the same time stand up for our rights
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:08.720]  how far do you think they may go well they'll go as far as we allow them and
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:13.160]  once again that brings my main point of the apathy right now I gotta tell you
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:19.880]  Alex I hear a lot of squawking from petty individuals well I'm not a member of
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:23.560]  the NRA because they didn't call me back I'm not a member of the NRA because
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:27.720]  they didn't they didn't help my uncle when he got caught drunk with a shotgun
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:33.640]  you know if you're not a member of the National Rifle Association Barack Obama
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:39.840]  loves you and if you're not a member of the National Rifle Association you have
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:45.240]  no voice in the battle for freedom because when it gets right down to it
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:52.560]  it is the NRA and the members of the NRA who stopped the attempt to ban 223 5.5
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:58.400]  6 ammo when it when they went Barack Obama was doing double-back flips trying
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:03.400]  to ban the most powerful the most unpopular around it's not powerful at
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:09.080]  all the most popular round in in America and it was the NRA members that went
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:17.200]  no way punk and we stopped him so they the anti-gunners would turn us into Cuba
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:21.840]  tonight if they could and they've already done it in Massachusetts Maryland
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:27.880]  Connecticut Delaware New Jersey New York it's just criminal the flagrant
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:32.720]  infringement that's a constitutional violation in all those states I just
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:39.760]  mentioned where you can't keep or bear jack squat and that's because not enough
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:47.040]  citizens in those states stood up to the term tyrannical outrage of Cuomo and
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:52.400]  even Chris Christie and certainly the their governors before them but those
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:57.640]  five states Massachusetts Maryland Connecticut New York New Jersey they
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:01.120]  don't have second amendments well I look at the governor of New York saying
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:04.520]  if you're pro-gun get out of the state if you're pro-life get out of the state
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:09.240]  these are fundamentally gangster thugs who all have bodyguards but want us to
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:12.760]  be disarmed and I've got to be honest with you Ted they're moving quicker and
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:16.760]  I've been the alarmist all these years that even I thought they would they
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:21.960]  seem so arrogant so aggressive and I just hope people realize the LA Times
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:26.080]  announced yesterday they're going to close half the roads and make them for
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:31.240]  driverless cars and they admitted in the article to make traffic worse and they
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:36.640]  use the clowered and pivot term to nudge you into getting out of your car and
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:41.320]  they admit to make you use their mass transit I mean these people are the most
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:46.040]  sickening control freaks and that's the problem with Americana John Wayne mom and
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:54.240]  apple pie type people is we're too proud and we're too cool to get aggressive we
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.480]  don't want power we got our own lives we want to be left alone we don't get in
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:03.800]  our neighbor's business we try to stay out of the way of control freaks it's
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:08.600]  time to get aggressive like you've done in these people's faces they're not
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:12.960]  going away we've got to stop complying there's an article out of Pittsburgh where
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.360]  it was a barber shop 40-year-old barber shop they send a feminist in to say cut
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:22.680]  my hair do my curls they said man we don't do that we only you know trim short
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:27.360]  hair she went had the city fine them for discrimination it's not discrimination
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:30.880]  you know it's like saying of a woman came in and said give me a vasectomy at a
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:34.440]  doctor's office and they said well man we only do that on people that have you
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:38.320]  know testicles I mean I hate to talk like that the guest earlier made the
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:41.840]  point be like if you had a Chevy and brought it and told a Ford shop you know
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:46.560]  to put Ford parts on it sorry we don't do Chevy parts I mean the they've banned
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:51.180]  brown bags in Seattle saying they're racist I mean these people want to
[02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:56.240]  control reality they are a group of of cult leaders I'm sorry I'm running the
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:03.000]  the examples you bring up I I could just gag laughing except it's so cruel it's
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:08.480]  so real and let's let's just jettison now to the forefront of freedom I moved
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:13.680]  to Texas 13 years ago because Michigan turned into a suburb of Chicago the laws
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:20.600]  up there I can't even have an uncased firearm in my truck on my farm I'm not
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:27.640]  allowed in Michigan to have an uncased bow my bow and arrow has to be completely
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:32.960]  enclosed in the case when it's on my four-wheeler or in my truck anywhere in
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:38.160]  Michigan Alex and I could go on and on while all my friends across America are
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:43.280]  hunting dubs on Labor Day in Michigan they're flying all over the place
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:47.080]  Michigan produces more dubs than all the quail pheasant woodcock and grouse
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:53.200]  combined you can hunt all those four species but morning dubs are against the
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:58.640]  law to hunt in Michigan I felt like I had landed in Cuba but let's jump right to
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:05.320]  the blast best place Texas I have undying reverence for the great heroes of law
[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:08.920]  enforcement especially in our fishing game here in Texas Parks and Wildlife
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.360]  what a great bunch of men and women what a great job we've done in Texas
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:17.640]  managing our wildlife to be the healthiest most flourishing wildlife ever
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:26.680]  yet in Texas the Texas Parks and Wildlife are going to a private ranch in
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:33.560]  Texas that has a breeder white tail operation and with a bunch of armed
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:39.440]  law enforcement members they are going to pull another Waco another ruby
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:45.520]  ridge and they are going to force the swatter of a private herd of white
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:52.920]  tails not in Massachusetts not in Illinois not in Michigan in Texas Alex
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:59.080]  under the guise of the CWD chronic wasting disease scam and they came in
[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:03.440]  and they forced the owners of the ranch out of their own home and off the
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:09.200]  property they forced all the employees off the property and at gunpoint the
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:17.520]  way I understand it at gunpoint Texas Parks and Wildlife is threatening to
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:22.120]  slaughter a private herd of white tail deer they've already forced a bunch of
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:27.360]  other ones to slaughter their own property Alex and and then when they did
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:31.960]  the test none of the deer had the disease exactly let's expand on that
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:36.880]  there is a move for urban hunting with bows because in Travis County they'll
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:41.080]  spend thousands of dollars per deer to load them up when they're overpopulated
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:47.920]  in cages and fly them out to west Texas to die why not bring in urban hunting
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:52.400]  and use this resource like they do in about 40 other states because it's
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:58.440]  already been proven I'm gonna tell you I love Texas but we ain't perfect yet so
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:03.840]  I'm giving a call to the great governor Abbott Mr. Greg Abbott I'm giving a
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:10.320]  call out to my elected employees in Texas stop the Texas Parks and Wildlife
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:18.480]  chronic wasting disease scam it is a scam because somebody on the the wildlife
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:24.680]  Commission doesn't like deer breeders I've got the proof and if we the people
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:32.120]  in Texas allow another Waco and a deer version of Waco where it even citizens
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:36.560]  Alex are being threatened if they interfere with the government coming in
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:42.160]  and swattering private wildlife it sets a very dangerous precedent they want a
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:47.040]  monopoly over these resources and I mean while there's this deer all over the
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:51.320]  places cities with no predators overpopulated stumbling around starving
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:55.000]  to death bow hunting should be brought in immediately we'll be back final

[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:40.480]  behind-the-scenes conversations you were getting into getting tough and what the
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:44.080]  candidates need to do and some of the articles you've got coming out so Ted
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:48.360]  Nugent tell us about that repeat what you said to me off air well everybody
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:51.840]  paying attention there's there's a bunch out there I travel all over the
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:57.280]  country Alex and every restaurant every airport every hunting camp I mean that I
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:01.920]  just got another letter and I get hundreds a year from an entire group of
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:06.640]  US military commandos over in Afghanistan that are doing a bunch of you
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:10.080]  know they're they're putting their lives on the line every day and I put their
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:15.000]  letter on my Facebook and it represents the pulse of America especially those
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:20.040]  that are at the top of our species the warriors the guys in the on the front
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:24.680]  lines of the war on terror thanking me for using the freedoms that their
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:31.640]  buddies died to provide so they they support me because I am radical and
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:37.000]  experimented self-government is radical to dare call us we the people is
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.080]  radical to demand that we have the right to keep and bear arms that's radical in
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:46.680]  a world of tyranny and dictators and tyrants and idiom ends and punk for
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:51.240]  all around the globe Kim Jong-un were radical but the founding fathers did was
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:59.200]  radical rose apart was radical if you're not radical you're a sheep and what I'm
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:03.840]  finding is that more and more people are being angered because the only guy that's
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:09.600]  really acting radical and standing up in a culture war fight is Donald Trump and
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:14.800]  Ted Cruz to a great part Ted Cruz a great man and Rick Perry's a great man but
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:19.040]  Donald Trump is the only guy calling a spade a spade and representing the
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:23.240]  frustration in the heartbreak at the corruption in the power abuse running a
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.320]  muck in our government media and academia so everybody out there right now
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.800]  the best thing you can do is be a member of the NRA get everybody in your
[02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:36.680]  family to work in at your hunting camp you've got to be National Rifle
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:40.960]  Association members you have to communicate with your elected officials
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:46.120]  I write some bold pieces every week for WND.com World Net Daily
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:52.600]  dailycaller.com even deer and deer hunting.com and about 20 sporting
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:57.400]  and conservation publications but I don't need to do any of this Alex I could
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:57:01.200]  just go hunting and go play my guitar and teach my grand but you've got to
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:04.920]  defend you've got an instinct to not want to be a slave and you were telling me
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:08.440]  you're surprised if these newest pieces don't get you a knock at your door I
[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:14.600]  know this the NRA was founded to train northerners how to shoot and arm blacks
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:18.280]  that have been newly freed it's had some bad leadership before but since you got
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:22.520]  on the board it's made a really good turn since Gunners of America the pressure
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:27.240]  on them it's made a really good turn yep and if it wasn't for the NRA and what
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:31.200]  you've done and others like Gunners of America we would have already lost the
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:34.100]  second amendment we're the only countries that still has it the right to
[02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:37.560]  keep their arms and they act like we're not coming for your guns when they are
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:42.200]  coming for our guns because they have an instinct to want to dominate men and
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:46.440]  to want to break the will of America the parasites that have taken over hate
[02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:51.480]  the strength of this country even though they're living off of it they're
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:56.440]  gonna be their own doom if they succeed Ted Nugent we got 45 seconds what's
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:01.040]  your bottom line bottom line is we the people have a responsibility of moral
[02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:04.440]  and intellectual and spiritual obligation to participate in the sacred
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:08.440]  experiment self-government there are heroes of the military dying so that we
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:14.680]  can how dare we not do so I want to salute operation finally home org for
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:19.840]  helping the heroes of the military and remember freedom is not free get engaged
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:24.480]  demand accountability and join the NRA that is the first step to taking this
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:28.640]  country back well Ted Nugent thank you for coming on the broadcast and you
[02:58:28.640 --> 02:58:31.200]  told us you'll come back on a routine basis will continue to track your

[02:59:50.160 --> 03:00:03.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show from his central Texas command center
[03:00:03.720 --> 03:00:09.920]  deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the
[03:00:09.920 --> 03:00:14.400]  GCN radio network here's the bottom line the social engineers the Republicans are
[03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:21.200]  part of it too are involved in class warfare and they've got people now that
[03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:24.640]  work in the system corporations and government that actually smoke the dope
[03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:30.240]  that drink the Jim Jones Kool-Aid and they really believe that it is a race
[03:00:30.240 --> 03:00:35.840]  war a class war and the people running things really want to create depression
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:40.160]  so then they can take over and be the total boss even though they'll destroy
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:45.880]  the entire country in the world I mean I look at the mayors and people that
[03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:48.920]  they're electing and you know I've always been somebody is the Republicans
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:55.880]  and Democrats but the Democrats are making their move to take over they've

[03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:46.120]  playing god and they disdain themselves so they're projecting that on the

[03:15:02.520 --> 03:15:07.120]  with what's coming up today I mean this is getting crazy in China Russia the
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:12.720]  Middle East won't take all these really dangerous a lot of them refugees a lot
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:15.760]  of them are al-qaeda and terrorist fighters we have the video up on info
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:19.400]  wars.com of them on Facebook bragging that they're you know veterans of ISIS
[03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:24.000]  and al-qaeda and the Donald Trump comes out and says man you got to really
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:28.240]  admire Merkel yeah we got to take these people in I mean this is Frickville you
[03:15:28.240 --> 03:15:32.080]  think she's got us on the hook now Leanne where do you see all this going
[03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:35.560]  I know you don't even see yourself as a really as a conservative more of a
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:39.880]  humanitarian more libertarian I don't want to speak for you being here three
[03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:44.720]  years I mean and I'm changing my views I'm getting more radical because it's
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:48.880]  it's just reached cult freak show level what do you make about my whole five
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:54.640]  minute rant you just heard well I just don't understand how all of this seems
[03:15:54.640 --> 03:16:00.600]  to be appearing out of the blue I mean how do you not see hundreds of thousands
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:05.560]  of people pouring across the border you know hundreds of people raping and
[03:16:05.560 --> 03:16:09.360]  robbing and robbing people around vehicles like the globalists have set
[03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:12.920]  this whole thing up they instigated the chaos they know it's coming and then
[03:16:12.920 --> 03:16:20.120]  all of a sudden we see the images when it gets extreme whereas in America we
[03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:24.760]  were never allowed to see the illegal immigrants pouring across our border
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:28.920]  even though it was hundreds of thousands because it didn't fit their
[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:33.360]  agenda here you are totally on in fact this morning I meant to make that point
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:36.680]  first and foremost that I get so upset by the time I go on air reading on the
[03:16:36.680 --> 03:16:39.960]  news that I just can't even do it that you could see how they sort of tell the
[03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:43.400]  immigrants years ago come giving them freebies they destabilize the countries
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:48.320]  they let them in they let it build till 800,000 are now come in total in the
[03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:51.200]  last few months they're pouring through everywhere that's the number we have it's
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:55.040]  probably worse and then suddenly their answer is we got to take them all in
[03:16:55.040 --> 03:16:59.760]  exactly you can see the premeditation of this right and then if you don't want
[03:16:59.760 --> 03:17:04.240]  to take them in or if you're you're a bad person you're racist or you're evil
[03:17:04.240 --> 03:17:08.600]  and getting everyone to sort of fight amongst themselves and fight against
[03:17:08.600 --> 03:17:14.200]  these some of these people who truly are fleeing madness you know to be angry at
[03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:19.600]  them rather than angry at the people who have instigated this chaos and the
[03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:25.600]  policies and the war and the you know borders wide open policies that are
[03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:29.600]  bringing them all in so it's that's what we should be focusing on and fighting
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:35.080]  against but instead it's like you're a bad person because you don't want you
[03:17:35.080 --> 03:17:40.000]  know boys to use the girls bathroom or you know stuff that doesn't matter well
[03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:44.040]  it's it's all just like psychiatrists on record came out with this to mess us up
[03:17:44.040 --> 03:17:48.160]  they said the sexies this is the whole plan just to create total obsessions with
[03:17:48.160 --> 03:17:53.800]  our weewees you know instead of like the big giant issues of cancer viruses and
[03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:58.440]  the vaccines you and Rob do are gonna be hosting the rest of show I'm gonna punch
[03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:04.080]  you out of here but these people mean business they're moving on all fronts and
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:08.120]  I wanted to ask Rob do what do you make a Donald Trump now suddenly flip flopping
[03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:12.800]  and and going yeah we need to bring these illegals these migrants into the
[03:18:12.800 --> 03:18:17.840]  United States and Merkel's doing a great job I mean you think conservatives are
[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:22.440]  so on his hook now that they're gonna want jihadis in their bedrooms I think
[03:18:22.440 --> 03:18:26.720]  this goes back to the fact that he signed that pledge his loyalty pledged to
[03:18:26.720 --> 03:18:29.080]  the Republican Party and now they're saying look you got to start playing
[03:18:29.080 --> 03:18:32.400]  ball with us or we're gonna undercut you we're gonna get you out of this race
[03:18:32.400 --> 03:18:36.640]  like what they did was Ron Paul you won't even get mentioned and then you'll
[03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:40.400]  feel go into obscurity because you know right now every time they say something
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:43.800]  positive or negative his ratings go up so it doesn't matter as long as they're
[03:18:43.800 --> 03:18:47.440]  mentioning Trump it's just like the golden goose it keeps laying golden eggs
[03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:50.440]  for him so I think he's starting to play ball because he got the message at some
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:55.320]  point on some level and he probably will never admit it it might come out later
[03:18:55.320 --> 03:18:58.400]  like what happened with Ross Perot when he got out of the race and then he got
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:02.040]  back in but it was too late to really affect I mean once the president Trump
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:06.840]  if he's president Obama exactly or president globalist whoever you know
[03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:11.160]  they're all the same guy they just change out the face as a great graphic you
[03:19:11.160 --> 03:19:15.160]  had I believe it was an Obama deception as the the guy pops up and then it
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:19.720]  changes to the next one changes to the next one and it doesn't matter who's
[03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:23.400]  really in charge those guys aren't in charge what are you and Maca do got
[03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:28.440]  coming up today well I found a video from RT put out basically echoing the same
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:31.920]  things we've been talking about with this migrant invasion that's going on in
[03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:36.600]  Europe and how nobody the mainstream media here in the United States is is
[03:19:36.600 --> 03:19:40.040]  taking the angle oh we have to help these people what's the president gonna do
[03:19:40.040 --> 03:19:43.840]  how are we gonna help these people and not the focus on this is how ISIS is
[03:19:43.840 --> 03:19:47.080]  getting people into the country you know the only thing the American media is
[03:19:47.080 --> 03:19:51.000]  talking about is the Hungarian woman a camera woman who tripped a migrant well
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:55.840]  you know these people are coming in illegally I think I better agree what

[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:18.280]  host Rob do sitting in here in the original radio studio that we've built
[03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:26.400]  back in January 2009 and December 2008 moved in here when I started in February
[03:24:26.400 --> 03:24:30.440]  it was just one little part of a building and slowly with your help and
[03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:35.200]  your support we've been able to expand to where now we've got the giant nightly
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:39.760]  news studio out there the radio show studio out there and we're building or
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:44.840]  we're using this one we're revamping the original nightly news studio and we just
[03:24:44.840 --> 03:24:47.800]  keep doing this with your support so we really do appreciate all the support out
[03:24:47.800 --> 03:24:51.840]  there that our prisonplanet.tv members have been giving us this is a short
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:54.560]  segment I've got Leigh Ann McAdoo in the control room we're gonna play some clips
[03:24:54.560 --> 03:24:59.360]  that I saw from a report that RT put out and they kind of sounded they sound a
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:03.040]  lot like what we're doing here at Info Wars but you don't see any of these
[03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:06.560]  angles coming out of the mainstream media here in the United States well now
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:09.480]  there's football season now there's deflate gate we could just keep talking
[03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:14.200]  about these issues non-stop that really don't mean anything so I want to get
[03:25:14.200 --> 03:25:18.200]  into that starting off we're also going to get into a little bit of information
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:22.280]  about the food babe coming up probably towards the end of the hour but thank you
[03:25:22.280 --> 03:25:25.960]  for joining us this first video I want to get into here's the article ISIS fears
[03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:29.640]  hungry TV reports suggest militants posing as refugees crossing to Europe
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:34.400]  this is something we've been telling you all about for a long time that ISIS is
[03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:40.200]  going to use and be infiltrating into Europe and then also coming into the
[03:25:40.200 --> 03:25:43.320]  United States going in through the southern border because it's basically
[03:25:43.320 --> 03:25:47.680]  wide open it's basically controlled by drug dealers so they could come into
[03:25:47.680 --> 03:25:53.160]  South America I remember we had a we were playing a clip and covering that a
[03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:57.560]  general and this is back January February of this year it might even been
[03:25:57.560 --> 03:26:00.360]  in the last year where a general was talking about how they were finding
[03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:04.000]  guys from Africa who were getting into Central America and then getting on the
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:08.160]  beast train coming up into the United States unfettered as long as they paid
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:12.360]  their way so this is how ISIS is going to get into America we've seen the
[03:26:12.360 --> 03:26:16.080]  attack in Dallas so they're already ramping this stuff up and now they are
[03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:20.760]  in Europe and let's go to this first clip from RT this is RT ISIS in Europe
[03:26:20.760 --> 03:26:24.640]  there is alarm in Europe over allegations that Islamic State militants
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:28.640]  are infiltrating the continent by blending with crowds of migrants one
[03:26:28.640 --> 03:26:32.200]  Hungarian TV network is even reporting that the security services have
[03:26:32.200 --> 03:26:37.000]  detained two militants who revealed their identities in photos on social media
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:50.040]  he's speaking Hungarian there and but what he's saying is Islamist terrorist
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:53.800]  disguised as refugees have shown up in Europe and he was showing some pictures
[03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:58.520]  that were uploaded to Facebook actually have some more photos clip number three
[03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:01.960]  guys ISIS Europe photos let's just go ahead and roll that right now and you
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:07.200]  could see them as ISIS fighters and then what appears to be them in Europe
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:12.480]  these are all submitted to to I guess they've been circulating around social
[03:27:12.480 --> 03:27:17.560]  media and you can see the resemblance in these guys are they crisis actors I
[03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:21.640]  mean who knows it is just getting weirder and weirder as it goes along but
[03:27:21.640 --> 03:27:25.280]  this proves what we've been saying all along that they are going to use this
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:31.000]  migration invasion so-called crisis to come into Europe and then cause
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:34.360]  disruptions in Europe and also they're gonna be coming into through South
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:39.640]  America up into the United States so I think it's just very telling also want
[03:27:39.640 --> 03:27:43.760]  to show you this clip this is after they show the clip of the camera woman
[03:27:43.760 --> 03:27:49.120]  tripping the migrants and I kind of people are saying she's horrible and
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:53.240]  she got fired for doing that and maybe she should not have interfered but I
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:56.120]  think at a gut level she said look these people are just pouring into my
[03:27:56.120 --> 03:28:00.160]  country I got to do something and as a journalist covering it then I guess she
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:03.160]  also felt she had to step into the fray and she did trip a couple people I
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:06.080]  don't agree that she should have been tripping people but I understand where
[03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:10.520]  she's coming from trying to defend her country but let's go to clip 4 and this
[03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:13.720]  shows the mess that the migrants are leaving behind and I just want you to
[03:28:13.720 --> 03:28:17.720]  look at the quality of tense that the migrants are being supplied with many
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:21.760]  of the migrants that gave up waiting for buses to take them into a refugee camp
[03:28:21.760 --> 03:28:26.200]  and tried to break through police lines hundreds fled into the surrounding
[03:28:26.200 --> 03:28:30.640]  cornfields aiming to reach Budapest on foot but this is what was left behind
[03:28:30.640 --> 03:28:34.380]  when the refugees continued their journey images of trash string road
[03:28:34.380 --> 03:28:39.240]  sides like these are being spread online along with plenty of criticism but
[03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:43.960]  the migrants say they simply had nowhere to put it this is just one of the
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:48.880]  latest developments in the continent's ongoing crisis well I'm interested to
[03:28:48.880 --> 03:28:53.040]  find out who is supplying them with brand new tents they look like they they
[03:28:53.040 --> 03:28:56.840]  just went to Academy or REI or something like that and just load it up with
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:28:59.000]  brand new tents that they're being given they're being given these from
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:04.840]  somewhere maybe there's a guy at the docks in Syria passing out tents as they
[03:29:04.840 --> 03:29:08.840]  go along interestingly there's a there was a graph and I don't have it in
[03:29:08.840 --> 03:29:14.560]  front of me now but it was like 77% of the refugees are men coming in which is
[03:29:14.560 --> 03:29:19.280]  that is not families that is that is mostly men coming in and they're doing
[03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:22.960]  that so they can disguise the fighters that are coming in they're blending a
[03:29:22.960 --> 03:29:27.800]  man it's really really disturbing also I want to cover this is something we
[03:29:27.800 --> 03:29:31.960]  tweeted out a couple days ago guys I'm gonna bring up the tweet over here and
[03:29:31.960 --> 03:29:39.920]  it was from all Joseph Watson showing how Saudi Arabia Bahrain cater the way
[03:29:39.920 --> 03:29:44.640]  United Arab Emirates Oman it's up right now are not letting in any of these
[03:29:44.640 --> 03:29:47.800]  migrants into their countries they're keeping their borders closed and we're
[03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:53.320]  gonna talk about that why I'm not gonna come back the empires on the run Alex Jones and
[03:29:53.320 --> 03:29:56.760]  the GCN radio network
[03:29:58.800 --> 03:30:05.040]  schools in Germany are ordering teenage girls not to wear miniskirts or shorts
[03:30:05.040 --> 03:30:10.400]  as to avoid offending Muslim immigrants parents were warned that their
[03:30:10.400 --> 03:30:15.440]  children should not wear revealing clothes for fear of misunderstandings
[03:30:15.440 --> 03:30:21.200]  that could lead to attacks by the migrants children were also told that
[03:30:21.200 --> 03:30:27.200]  derogatory or racial remarks will not be tolerated the letter was actually sent
[03:30:27.200 --> 03:30:31.920]  out at the end of June but it is drawing fresh attention in the light of
[03:30:31.920 --> 03:30:38.080]  Germany's plan to accept 800,000 new migrants before the end of the year and
[03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:44.560]  500,000 a year for the foreseeable future info wars has been contacted by
[03:30:44.560 --> 03:30:49.240]  families in Germany who say that their schools are telling girls not to wear

[03:34:05.320 --> 03:34:09.800]  happening the satellite system uplinks which is why we're throwing the money

[03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:52.400]  Jakari Jackson, David Knight, Joe Biggs, Anthony Gucci, already sitting in here
[03:35:52.400 --> 03:35:56.640]  hosting it's been a real pleasure for me to be hosting this the last few days it's
[03:35:56.640 --> 03:35:59.880]  really exciting and especially after a few days you really get used to it but
[03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:03.040]  now I want to go back to those videos Leanne McAdoo are you there and what do
[03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:08.160]  you think of what has been going on now that you know it looks like RT is you
[03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:10.760]  know almost parroting info wars with the information we're putting out but we
[03:36:10.760 --> 03:36:13.680]  don't see this anywhere in the mainstream media here in the United
[03:36:13.680 --> 03:36:18.080]  States. Right well that's the exact same thing we were experiencing with the
[03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:22.080]  illegal immigration issues at our own border that they didn't want anyone to
[03:36:22.080 --> 03:36:26.040]  know that criminals were coming through and drugs are coming through and you
[03:36:26.040 --> 03:36:29.600]  know they just want you to see the images of the young children and the
[03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:33.800]  families because that's how they can convince you to go along with the
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:40.160]  globalist solution. They create the chaos and then you know the solution is
[03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:46.720]  this globalist borderless world that they control. Right where you can't say
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:50.160]  anything bad about Muslims but they could cut your head off if they don't
[03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:53.640]  like you or they could cut your hands off or they could make women cover up or
[03:36:53.640 --> 03:36:56.880]  if you're in Germany you're not allowed to wear a skirt now because you might
[03:36:56.880 --> 03:37:00.600]  offend somebody but they can do whatever they want because you know they're
[03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:03.200]  Muslims and I'm not trying to single out Muslims that's how the political
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:07.480]  correctness culture breeds itself. It could be any group that they perceive is
[03:37:07.480 --> 03:37:12.840]  being hassled by the system. Now I want to go to this clip here talking about
[03:37:12.840 --> 03:37:17.880]  you know we tweeted out that no migrants were accepted by these countries. We were
[03:37:17.880 --> 03:37:21.920]  actually lying it's actually changed now apparently they're opening their
[03:37:21.920 --> 03:37:25.440]  borders up and let's see how many they're accepting now this is no mid-east
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:32.400]  help. A flow of migrants from the Middle East to Gulf States are coming under
[03:37:32.400 --> 03:37:36.600]  fire for keeping their borders closed. Human Rights Watch has criticized wealthy
[03:37:36.600 --> 03:37:42.480]  Arab nations for refusing to take in asylum seekers. The countries do provide
[03:37:42.480 --> 03:37:46.720]  significant financial and humanitarian help to people affected by Middle East
[03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:51.080]  conflicts but are keeping their doors firmly shut since the war in Syria
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:56.960]  started in 2011. Kuwait has accepted just seven refugees the United Arab Emirates
[03:37:56.960 --> 03:38:01.720]  16 and Saudi Arabia only four. Alright so so we stand corrected we have to
[03:38:01.720 --> 03:38:05.760]  correct ourselves we had zeros for everybody the big doughnut but it's
[03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:12.240]  actually 27 migrants have been brought into those countries 27 compared to the
[03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:16.760]  hundreds of thousands that are heading to Europe through Turkey going in through
[03:38:16.760 --> 03:38:20.960]  Eastern Europe coming into Greece and the island of Lesbos where you have
[03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:25.120]  Syrian refugees have turned Lesbos into a war zone. Residents claim as migrants
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:29.520]  chant FU at Hungarian police amid fears ISIS using the crisis to enter Europe.
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:35.560]  That came out today in the Daily Mail and it's just amazing what do you make of
[03:38:35.560 --> 03:38:39.520]  that that they're actually now there there's a small trickle Leigh Ann going
[03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:46.680]  into some of these well-off high society not I guess there's no wars going on in
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:49.520]  any of those countries at this point other than the oppression of their
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:53.360]  citizens. Leigh Ann McAddy what do you make of that? The economic war that's
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:59.200]  being waged against the citizenry there. It's just frightening to me I mean you
[03:38:59.200 --> 03:39:03.480]  see those the lifeboats that are sinking with all those people on board I mean
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:09.160]  that's the perfect metaphor for countries that can't afford to bring in
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:14.280]  more people or you know countries like Hungary they say well we're a Christian
[03:39:14.280 --> 03:39:19.040]  foundation so if we bring a lot of people in who are gonna fundamentally change
[03:39:19.040 --> 03:39:26.400]  our society you're in a sinking lifeboat it's just frightening. Meanwhile you
[03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:29.840]  have and this came out in the Washington Times I'm surprised they report on it
[03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:34.080]  agents say 20% of illegals caught at border have criminal records so what
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:39.720]  Donald Trump was saying is actually partially correct 20% of the ones that
[03:39:39.720 --> 03:39:43.320]  they catch at least and and we've talked to border agents we've sent our guys
[03:39:43.320 --> 03:39:47.160]  down there and they say they they think they catch about half of the people that
[03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:53.200]  come across illegally so you've got maybe 40% maybe even larger numbers of
[03:39:53.200 --> 03:39:56.320]  people that aren't being caught that are criminals we shot that that's a picture
[03:39:56.320 --> 03:40:00.840]  that our camera guy Josh Owens and Joe Biggs when they were down at the border
[03:40:00.840 --> 03:40:05.440]  shot that of those guys coming across the border dumping in what looks like
[03:40:05.440 --> 03:40:12.920]  50 kilo barrel of batches wrapped up into a car that car takes off right in
[03:40:12.920 --> 03:40:17.400]  broad daylight and the border agents that were there leave five minutes before
[03:40:17.400 --> 03:40:22.960]  the shipment arrives very coincidental and this political correctness goes all
[03:40:22.960 --> 03:40:25.600]  the way how you're not allowed to say anything bad about the migrants you're
[03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:28.440]  gonna be criticized well I think we should bring all this stuff out that
[03:40:28.440 --> 03:40:31.960]  ISIS is using this as a smokescreen to enter countries and no we're not being
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:36.280]  racist about it and maybe some of these mid-eastern countries that are causing
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:39.560]  the problem okay they're actually causing the problem let's look at this
[03:40:39.560 --> 03:40:43.720]  last clip this is how the Saudi border is set up now they want to fund all these
[03:40:43.720 --> 03:40:47.240]  radical Islamic movements but then they don't want to take any of the fallout so
[03:40:47.240 --> 03:40:51.920]  here's that clip Saudis are putting up a 900 kilometer razor wire fence on the
[03:40:51.920 --> 03:40:55.840]  border with Iraq there are also underground movement sensors capable of
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:40:59.600]  triggering a silent alarms the issue here is very clear that the Gulf
[03:40:59.600 --> 03:41:05.440]  countries are more interested in funding armed groups in Syria rather than
[03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:10.960]  assist the Syrian people invite them to live in the Gulf instead of having them
[03:41:10.960 --> 03:41:18.200]  travel in the midst of seas and in the dangers that we see very clearly so I
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:21.800]  would give kudos to RT for reporting on that and actually telling what's
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:26.120]  really going on that's what we're trying to do here at info wars.com what do you
[03:41:26.120 --> 03:41:30.280]  think of that border they actually setting up a fence but they have a
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:34.040]  double a dual barrier with the motion sensors which I think we went and
[03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:38.040]  interviewed a local rancher out in Arizona who set up the same type of
[03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:42.000]  system with motion sensors that actually pop drones out into the sky so you can
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:46.560]  get a bird's eye view that's easily a system with the technology we have here
[03:41:46.560 --> 03:41:49.760]  we could put a lot of people to work actually building a system like that
[03:41:49.760 --> 03:41:53.800]  just to track our border not to necessarily go in and kill people who
[03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:56.840]  are crossing the border but to see who's coming in find out where they're
[03:41:56.840 --> 03:42:00.800]  going and then bring people in you know the ones that really need help let's
[03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:03.920]  help them the ones that don't need help let's get them back into their country
[03:42:03.920 --> 03:42:07.160]  and get them out of our country right well they just want to create the
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:11.560]  terrorists and frankly they're they're building that fence around their country
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:15.880]  because they know that they're the number one target yeah the chickens are
[03:42:15.880 --> 03:42:19.200]  gonna come home to roost at some point so they're stopping that they know that
[03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:25.560]  they're guilty which is why they want to to close that off now it was late last
[03:42:25.560 --> 03:42:30.200]  it was late August actually went and shot some footage of UT removing the
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:35.560]  Jefferson Davis statue along with Woodrow Wilson removing that from UT and
[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:39.280]  this is how far the political craigness has gone here because Jefferson Davis
[03:42:39.280 --> 03:42:42.520]  was head of the Confederacy he was elected to be the leader of the
[03:42:42.520 --> 03:42:47.640]  Confederacy and at one time you know he did own slaves and then you got Woodrow
[03:42:47.640 --> 03:42:52.080]  Wilson who's he was a supporter of the Klan created the Federal Reserve which
[03:42:52.080 --> 03:42:57.320]  is essentially created turned us all into debt slaves so we have that but
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:00.840]  John Bowne we played a report last night on the nightly news where John Bowne
[03:43:00.840 --> 03:43:06.120]  points out that here's a Confederate statue that nobody's gonna remove nobody's
[03:43:06.120 --> 03:43:10.480]  gonna take down and it's because he is part of the in crowd and that's Albert
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:13.720]  Pike so you guys have that video queued up let's go to it and then Leanne will
[03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:24.120]  get your comments on it
[03:43:24.120 --> 03:43:30.040]  is big ready to go on the University of Texas pulled the Jefferson Davis
[03:43:30.040 --> 03:43:34.400]  statue from its campus because of a growing irrational fear of American
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:40.000]  history on the Northwest axis of 3rd and D in the nation's capital sits the
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:44.800]  Albert Pike statue dedicated to the leader of the Southern jurisdiction of
[03:43:44.800 --> 03:43:50.440]  the Scottish right a title Pike held for 32 years he was also a Confederate
[03:43:50.440 --> 03:43:55.760]  Brigadier General he was also the Chief Judicial Officer and Arkansas Grand
[03:43:55.760 --> 03:44:00.960]  Dragon of the newly formed Ku Klux Klan this is the only statue in Washington
[03:44:00.960 --> 03:44:05.960]  DC commemorating a Confederate soldier much less a founding member of the Klan
[03:44:05.960 --> 03:44:10.440]  in fact pike was said to have owned a bracelet that allowed him perpetual
[03:44:10.440 --> 03:44:15.280]  communication with Lucifer himself so if the Confederate flag is being
[03:44:15.280 --> 03:44:19.080]  denounced and Jefferson Davis and other Confederate monuments are under
[03:44:19.080 --> 03:44:25.160]  consideration for removal why does this statue still remain simple pike is
[03:44:25.160 --> 03:44:29.160]  highly revered by the very occultic groups in control of the puppet
[03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:35.000]  government installed in Washington DC his 1871 letter to Illuminati mafia
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:39.800]  founder Giuseppe Mazini predicts a succession of three world wars a
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:45.440]  game plan followed to a tee by the global elite it was pike that wrote the
[03:44:45.440 --> 03:44:50.280]  rituals that would create a secret society within a secret society the
[03:44:50.280 --> 03:44:56.080]  33rd degree the 33rd degree would serve as a continuation of the Luciferian
[03:44:56.080 --> 03:45:00.720]  goals established by an older order known as the order of the Palladium all
[03:45:00.720 --> 03:45:05.360]  master masons brought into the higher degrees would have to take orders from
[03:45:05.360 --> 03:45:09.840]  higher masons this long list of initiates includes presidents Supreme
[03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:14.640]  Court justices and military leaders it was pike and Illuminati conspirators
[03:45:14.640 --> 03:45:18.640]  that infiltrated the world of Freemasonry armed with a doctrine to
[03:45:18.640 --> 03:45:23.200]  establish a one-world order these conspirators such as Lord Henry
[03:45:23.200 --> 03:45:28.120]  Palmerston of England and Otto von Bismarck of Germany built global hubs
[03:45:28.120 --> 03:45:32.800]  for the Illuminati and these hubs known as the Supreme Councils of the Scottish
[03:45:32.800 --> 03:45:39.520]  right like the one located at 1733 16th Street Northwest in Washington DC have
[03:45:39.520 --> 03:45:45.000]  been in operation ever since Washington DC itself is reputed to have been
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:49.600]  designed to represent a pentagram in the Masonic Square in compass which would
[03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:53.760]  add to the confusing manner in which the streets of the district of criminals are
[03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:58.720]  set up masons have long argued that pike was not a member or founding father of
[03:45:58.720 --> 03:46:05.160]  the clan however the 1905 publication Ku Klux Klan its origin growth and
[03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:10.800]  disbandment by JC Lester and DL Wilson clearly lists Albert Pike as one of its
[03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:15.360]  founding members this book was intent on glorifying the clan and its origins
[03:46:15.360 --> 03:46:20.400]  hardly an effort to spread misinformation if awareness grows the very
[03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:24.800]  people behind the liberal agenda to spread political correctness while
[03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:29.800]  abandoning our ugly American history will have clumsily uncovered a nest of
[03:46:29.800 --> 03:46:35.120]  treasonous activity and Luciferian dogma exposed in the light of day Albert
[03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:40.280]  Pike issued this statement to the 23 Supreme Councils of the world we
[03:46:40.280 --> 03:46:45.480]  worship a God but it is the God one adores without superstition to you
[03:46:45.480 --> 03:46:51.040]  sovereign grand instructors general we say this that you may repeat it to the
[03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:57.120]  brethren of the 32nd 31st and 30th degrees the Masonic religion should be
[03:46:57.120 --> 03:47:01.800]  by all of us initiates of the high degrees maintained in the purity of
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:11.960]  the Luciferian doctrine Albert Pike July 14th 1889 John bound for infowars.com
[03:47:11.960 --> 03:47:17.600]  media as they're promoting their race for you're not going to see him talk
[03:47:17.600 --> 03:47:21.800]  about the Albert Pike statue and how it needs to be brought down and why here's
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:26.000]  a guy that was a part of the Confederacy he also helped found the
[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:30.920]  Ku Klux Klan which people try to dismiss and he was a 33rd degree Mason but
[03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:35.920]  you're not going to hear about that anywhere else but here at info wars.com
[03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:41.360]  Leanne what do you make of that well kudos to John bound he is always coming
[03:47:41.360 --> 03:47:46.320]  with the fire on his reports but that's what we see they'll kind of throw us a
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:49.800]  bone and say oh well they're really upset about those Confederate statues so
[03:47:49.800 --> 03:47:54.000]  we'll take these down and those down but they don't get to the root of the
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:58.040]  problem and we say that from the beginning like it's just a piece of
[03:47:58.040 --> 03:48:01.960]  cloth it's not going to get to the root same with this Freddie Gray payout they
[03:48:01.960 --> 03:48:06.600]  just decided you know 6.4 million going to the family and that's because they
[03:48:06.600 --> 03:48:10.960]  didn't want more riots if a jury decided you know something the people
[03:48:10.960 --> 03:48:14.440]  weren't happy with and that's because you're racist against well the founders
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:19.880]  the Klan Albert Pike exactly they call Southern probably Law Center right we
[03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:23.800]  found a racist yeah it's just amazing you won't even hear the name Albert
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:27.160]  Pike mentioned in any of those Confederate generals that they want to
[03:48:27.160 --> 03:48:30.440]  take down you you'll never even hear about him and if you do it won't be
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:35.760]  talking about how he was a part of the Klan and and part of the Confederacy and
[03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:40.920]  a Masonic 33rd degree Mason probably higher than that yeah and how he he says
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:44.480]  that in his it is quote there he wants everybody to follow the Luciferian
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:50.040]  doctrine well it just goes to show you these dark oppressors that are ruling
[03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:55.320]  our planet and why so hard to affect change and to get people to wake up and
[03:48:55.320 --> 03:49:01.320]  why we're programmed daily television radio everything I mean there are dark
[03:49:01.320 --> 03:49:05.680]  forces that have been in place for a really long time totally agree hey now
[03:49:05.680 --> 03:49:09.840]  this next segment you're actually gonna go on out and get ready for the news I
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:12.920]  think you're helping Jakari with a couple reports I'm gonna have Joe Big
[03:49:12.920 --> 03:49:17.320]  sit in here he's gonna be modeling the Hillary for a prison t-shirt and talk

[03:49:21.720 --> 03:49:26.600]  he's got some amazing stories of what happens when you put the truth out there
[03:49:26.600 --> 03:49:30.480]  in people's faces and I also want to remind everyone out there those of you
[03:49:30.480 --> 03:49:35.680]  that one person who gets the Hillary for prison t-shirt autographed by Hillary

[03:50:35.080 --> 03:50:38.800]  he's gonna take it and Fox News is bowing down to Joe Biden how he's gonna
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:43.920]  be the savior and now I think Joe's just another ringer to be thrown in to take
[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:49.200]  to take away the the eye of Sauron on Hillary but we're looking at Hillary
[03:50:49.200 --> 03:50:53.160]  right now we know what she's up to so we'll be back our final segment of info

[03:55:13.560 --> 03:55:17.120]  you think $25,000 is the end of what Monsanto is it goes a lot deeper than
[03:55:17.120 --> 03:55:20.720]  that so check out the article on info wars and then also there's an article
[03:55:20.720 --> 03:55:24.160]  on independent science news the puppet masters of academia what the New York
[03:55:24.160 --> 03:55:27.960]  Times left out now finishing up here I want to go to Joe Biggs let's get a
[03:55:27.960 --> 03:55:33.600]  shot of Joe Biggs wearing that Hillary for prison 2016 t-shirt Joe I'm gonna
[03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:36.400]  give you the floor tell me about those stories especially about the one where
[03:55:36.400 --> 03:55:40.360]  you sat down at the bar and the guy wanted to come punch you out well this
[03:55:40.360 --> 03:55:43.800]  Sunday I went out Sunday fun days since we don't have to do anything on Monday
[03:55:43.800 --> 03:55:49.160]  and I decided to wear this shirt out kind of promote it see what kind of vibe I
[03:55:49.160 --> 03:55:53.680]  got from the people in Austin with this shirt and this is a very liberal town
[03:55:53.680 --> 03:56:00.000]  and surprisingly I probably spent hours giving high fives taking pictures with
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:04.680]  people people love this shirt we put up a new picture today on the Alex Jones
[03:56:04.680 --> 03:56:09.600]  Twitter on different our Facebook's and all that everyone loves it now Sunday
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:16.080]  when I was out I went to this one bar I'm sit down to order a drink and I'm
[03:56:16.080 --> 03:56:19.720]  up there for about 20 minutes waiting because the bar staff is actually
[03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:23.000]  having a discussion about whether or not they should come over and serve me
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:27.600]  because they thought it said Hillary for president so I'm sitting here in the
[03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:31.120]  bartender finally walks over and he goes you know what I've been pacing back
[03:56:31.120 --> 03:56:36.040]  and forth back here just so angry that you would walk into my establishment
[03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:41.800]  wearing a Hillary for president 2016 shirt and then I noticed it had Hillary
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:45.760]  for prison he said I was seconds away from sending my bar back over here to
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:49.720]  punch you in the face he said you know what since you're wearing a Hillary for
[03:56:49.720 --> 03:56:53.800]  prison shirt you don't have to buy drinks here everything's on the house and
[03:56:53.800 --> 03:56:57.520]  that's the kind of love I got from everyone wearing this so I want you
[03:56:57.520 --> 03:57:02.520]  know everyone out there go to the Info War store get one of these shirts and go
[03:57:02.520 --> 03:57:07.040]  out take pictures let's get video of your interactions with people because
[03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:10.120]  everyone's saying that there's a lot of people out there who want to support
[03:57:10.120 --> 03:57:13.640]  Hillary if I'm in a liberal town and everyone's coming up and giving me
[03:57:13.640 --> 03:57:17.640]  high fives saying hell yeah that's an awesome shirt I want one where do I go
[03:57:17.640 --> 03:57:22.840]  get that I'd wear that every day then you know people out there are waking up
[03:57:22.840 --> 03:57:27.680]  and they see that this is a lying scumbag person who's trying to run for
[03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:31.200]  president people don't want that we want someone who's gonna be out there and be
[03:57:31.200 --> 03:57:35.640]  honest and serve us and do the right thing and Hillary is by far not the
[03:57:35.640 --> 03:57:40.440]  choice she is the worst human being on the face of the planet and it's not by
[03:57:40.440 --> 03:57:44.360]  overthrowing countries like Libya who haven't done anything to us it's not
[03:57:44.360 --> 03:57:48.360]  about setting up arms deals and then killing ambassadors and then standing by
[03:57:48.360 --> 03:57:51.360]  and pretending like you don't nothing that's not the kind of person we want
[03:57:51.360 --> 03:57:55.960]  saying that women are in huge support of Hillary I had more women running up to
[03:57:55.960 --> 03:57:59.360]  me coming over saying hey I love that shirt where do I get that sure let me
[03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:03.640]  get a high five can I take a picture I want that women don't support Hillary
