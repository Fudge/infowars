[00:00.000 --> 00:11.040]  Ladies and gentlemen the quickening is here. I have to get prepared for the
[00:11.040 --> 00:15.920]  broadcast. We have the most important news ever that we're gonna break on the
[00:15.920 --> 00:20.840]  other side. They have publicly put out their coup plans. That means they plan
[00:20.840 --> 00:25.120]  to go operational. This is your family, the Republic, the whole world and the
[00:25.120 --> 00:31.080]  greatest peril ever, ever. Trump and the American people stand in the way of the
[00:31.080 --> 00:35.400]  globalist takeover. Now let's go to this report. This is a real report with
[00:35.400 --> 00:38.960]  Amazon now launching drones in your house to surveil you and we'll be right
[00:38.960 --> 00:45.400]  by. Welcome to the Alexa Ring home surveillance trope. The latest innovation
[00:45.400 --> 00:49.840]  in home security. Now you're totally safe and a giant mega corporation is
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.120]  watching everything you do and selling data on you and your family. Welcome to
[00:54.120 --> 00:59.080]  the future. Oh never mind me. I'm just an autonomous drone from one of the most
[00:59.080 --> 01:03.760]  powerful and richest ruthless corporation in the world. Now you should watch
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.000]  what you say and remember I will report you to police and create databases. We
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.360]  sell the highest bidder. But if you criticize me I'll have your social credit
[01:14.360 --> 01:18.840]  score lowered and may even have you permanently detained. So watch what you
[01:18.840 --> 01:32.280]  say. Well the real life super villain, Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world has
[01:32.280 --> 01:37.920]  outdone himself with his Alexa system for many years. They're on record listening
[01:37.920 --> 01:42.760]  to you even when you don't activate the system and using the data to manipulate
[01:42.760 --> 01:47.360]  an algorithm that is attached to your name in a psychological file. And of course
[01:47.360 --> 01:51.560]  two weeks ago Jeff Bezos hired the former head of the national security
[01:51.560 --> 01:57.360]  agency, the big spy agency to help now come and run Amazon. Imagine if the
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.600]  national security agency asked you to put a flying robot in your house that
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.520]  watched you. You would say you're completely insane plus that doesn't
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.040]  exist. That's something out of a science fiction movie. But no, it's true. As of
[02:13.040 --> 02:17.360]  today, Amazon with no previous announcement has come out with their new
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.160]  Alexa. It's a little hub that watches and listens to you that you talk to that
[02:22.160 --> 02:26.960]  also launches a matrix like drone that flies around your house when someone
[02:26.960 --> 02:31.640]  supposedly breaking into it. But here's the problem. Jeff Bezos openly supports
[02:31.640 --> 02:36.440]  defunding the police. Jeff Bezos also supports abolishing the Second
[02:36.440 --> 02:40.880]  Amendment. So he doesn't believe that the drone will have its right to call the
[02:40.880 --> 02:44.400]  police to have them respond. And he doesn't believe you have a right to have a
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.960]  firearm to defend yourself from the robber breaking into your house. No, he's
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.440]  not selling you this because he wants to keep you safe. He is rolling out a
[02:53.440 --> 02:59.480]  cashless society, driverless car, grid all over the world where 5G is on every
[02:59.480 --> 03:05.400]  road and can control his cars and his drones. He admits he wants a system that
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.080]  will take over all normal human industrial and farming activity. You know,
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.480]  we already swallowed up 20 years ago the publishing industry and devastated it,
[03:14.480 --> 03:19.680]  ruined it. And now he's swallowing up transportation, robotics, shipping,
[03:19.680 --> 03:25.080]  everything. And now Amazon is censoring more and more books, more and more
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.080]  titles, more and more information, just like Apple, just like Google, just like
[03:29.080 --> 03:33.080]  Twitter. And when you talk about Apple and you talk about Google, they're
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.680]  helping keep millions of Muslims, Christians and Buddhists rounded up and
[03:37.680 --> 03:43.160]  kept in slave labor camps building widgets for Apple, Google and others. But
[03:43.160 --> 03:47.520]  out of all the supervillains, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Bezos is the most
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.120]  aggressive. I mean, talk about supervillains. His side hobby is having
[03:52.120 --> 03:57.600]  submarines find rocket parts from the Soviet and US space program. That's
[03:57.600 --> 04:01.360]  just his hobby. He's building a clock that will last, he thinks, millions of
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.200]  years out the middle of a US desert and he believes he's going to basically be
[04:05.200 --> 04:09.600]  immortal. But what I know is this, they have proven archaeologically that Troy
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.600]  existed thousands and thousands of years ago before the time of Christ. And
[04:14.600 --> 04:18.520]  Troy was a civilization that was invaded with a big, beautiful Trojan
[04:18.520 --> 04:23.200]  horse. They thought was a gift and they brought it in and soldiers were inside.
[04:23.200 --> 04:27.840]  Well, this is the same story of what brought down Troy, who would bring in
[04:27.840 --> 04:34.000]  a megalomaniac richest man in the world's robot because it's supposedly going
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.280]  to fly around the house and spy on intruders and criminals. When he
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.800]  supports the Marxist, Leninist, George Soros organization, Black Lounge
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.600]  Matter, and he supports the defunding of the police. No, this is the new digital
[04:48.600 --> 04:53.400]  police force that Big Tech's rolling out to enforce its global social credit
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.720]  score. And it's incredibly dangerous.
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.720]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fetchy. Doesn't matter if I'm invested with
[05:03.720 --> 05:08.360]  Bill Gates in many of the same vaccines I push on you. It's the same thing with
[05:08.360 --> 05:13.280]  the health ministers in the UK and Europe. They're all invested as well. But
[05:13.280 --> 05:18.320]  the governments have decided there's not a conflict of interest. Also, the
[05:18.320 --> 05:23.640]  media is going to call me a genius. When the second wave I've been warning of
[05:23.640 --> 05:28.520]  comes in the fall and winter, because we're going to count all the flu and
[05:28.520 --> 05:34.320]  all the pneumonia and cold deaths of old people again. And the lockdown will
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.960]  never end. That's why we're saying the vaccine will take several years. But
[05:39.960 --> 05:44.760]  don't worry, it'll come out. I'll make a bunch of money, you'll get sick. But
[05:44.760 --> 05:51.080]  that's okay. Because I ran the Wuhan lab, and it's all public, but I don't get
[05:51.080 --> 05:58.760]  in trouble. If you talk bad about me, we'll use big tech to get you out of there.
[05:58.760 --> 06:25.760]  The United States is fighting for its very existence. And if the republic falls, we
[06:25.760 --> 06:34.000]  will go through a process of globalization and Sovietization that will
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.680]  make communist China and the nightmares we've seen in communist Russia look
[06:38.680 --> 06:43.760]  like a cakewalk. Again, thank you for joining us on this live Friday, September
[06:43.760 --> 06:50.280]  25th 2020 transmission. We are 117 days out from the inauguration. We are 38
[06:50.280 --> 06:58.320]  days out from the election. Now, I'm sure you're noticing no one else is talking
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.320]  about the date to the inauguration. Everyone is talking about the election
[07:03.320 --> 07:08.480]  because we always know the day of who won. They know that. And they know the
[07:08.480 --> 07:13.480]  percentage of ballots that haven't been counted versus the calculation of what
[07:13.480 --> 07:17.120]  the numbers already are. So they can tell you by about nine o'clock or ten o'clock
[07:17.120 --> 07:22.200]  at night who's won. That's how they've done it. Now they tell you, oh, we put out
[07:22.200 --> 07:26.200]  80 million ballots that blue states and blue cities just decided to put out in
[07:26.200 --> 07:32.000]  violation of federal law and many state laws, and it's going to take weeks or
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.720]  months. And when President Trump challenges that, we're going to use the
[07:37.720 --> 07:46.280]  military to remove him. Now, we've been talking about this for over a year when
[07:46.280 --> 07:52.640]  they were first floating and around at the Pentagon with former Obama-appointed
[07:52.640 --> 07:59.160]  individuals and commissioned officers. And we've done extensive entire three
[07:59.160 --> 08:03.720]  hour, four hour shows on this. We've had expert guests on constitutional lawyers.
[08:03.720 --> 08:13.040]  Our analysis is dead, bang on, 100% on target. This crescendo built until August
[08:13.040 --> 08:17.280]  28th when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, had to
[08:17.280 --> 08:21.520]  come out and say, the Democrats have asked us in a formal letter to say they'll
[08:21.520 --> 08:27.040]  remove President Trump if there's any type of election contesting. Under the
[08:27.040 --> 08:32.920]  Constitution, that is not our duty and we cannot do that. Now that's been spun in
[08:32.920 --> 08:39.840]  the new talking point all over the news that the military is being asked by
[08:39.840 --> 08:44.320]  Trump to steal the election. Now, you see what's going on there about now. Now,
[08:44.320 --> 08:51.520]  why is this so seismic? We are 38 days from the Titanic hitting the damn
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.120]  iceberg. Then we're going to have a huge crisis of the Republic of the dollar,
[08:57.120 --> 09:01.400]  engineered race riots is the cover for this by the Communist Chinese and by
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.880]  their cohorts. This is totally illegal, totally insane, totally reckless, totally
[09:05.880 --> 09:12.560]  horrible. Now, what's going to happen when we hit the iceberg in 38 days? We'll
[09:12.560 --> 09:21.880]  then have 80 days or so to do the math, 38 subtracted from 117 and you get the
[09:21.880 --> 09:27.040]  number of days of total tumult and insanity and total internet kill switch
[09:27.040 --> 09:30.560]  that Obama put in place with big tech. They've announced that's going to be
[09:30.560 --> 09:36.560]  selectively enforced on a list of tens of millions of active Trump voters
[09:36.560 --> 09:41.400]  where your Twitter, your Facebook, your YouTube is not yours. They are saying
[09:41.400 --> 09:47.080]  they're going to lock your accounts starting election day. Watch. Even before
[09:47.080 --> 09:51.480]  the Democrats start contesting, which they'll do, oh, just give it one day to
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.840]  finish counting these ballots and it'll be, oh, it'll take a week. Oh, it's going
[09:54.840 --> 10:01.520]  to take two weeks. Oh, it's going to take a month. Just like, oh, 15 days. Cut back
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.720]  the curve, leave the hospitals open and then here you are eight months later
[10:04.720 --> 10:10.480]  locked down. And so we are cruising directly. We have radar. We can see out
[10:10.480 --> 10:17.560]  on the horizon 38 days out. Let's say 38 miles out. We have the gigantic iceberg
[10:17.560 --> 10:20.480]  sitting there right in front of us. They didn't have radar when the Titanic hit
[10:20.480 --> 10:26.040]  we do. And we're cruising right at the damn thing. And they're already
[10:26.040 --> 10:30.560]  preparing to tell you it's Trump's fault when they hit it on purpose. They're
[10:30.560 --> 10:34.920]  wrecking the election by steering it into the iceberg with the 80 million fake
[10:34.920 --> 10:41.400]  ballots and all the fraud and all the bust and the Texas just indicted a town
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.360]  where they caught him red handed, engaged in massive election fraud. We'll be
[10:46.360 --> 10:54.200]  covering that coming up. It's all unfolding right now. So I don't have a
[10:54.200 --> 11:01.160]  scale to turn up the level of concern I have. We're totally maxed out. This is
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.960]  lined up with all these foreign powers totally ganged up on America. The average
[11:04.960 --> 11:08.280]  Americans should 100% wake up and line up behind the president and line up
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.760]  behind their own common sense and their own self preservation because the very
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.680]  globalist new world order is saying that they're gonna teach you up in the
[11:16.680 --> 11:19.440]  Americans. They're gonna bankrupt everything. They're gonna sell us out
[11:19.440 --> 11:22.640]  even faster. They're gonna use carbon taxes to shut off all our industry
[11:22.640 --> 11:30.280]  that's left. China and India zero cuts. We're done because they want you on a
[11:30.280 --> 11:39.040]  minimum guaranteed income where you can be totally controlled at a subsistence
[11:39.040 --> 11:43.560]  level living in a giant high-rise coffin apartment owned by Jeff Bezos while
[11:43.560 --> 11:47.720]  he flies around in jet helicopters and has huge yachts. I mean they are building
[11:47.720 --> 11:51.960]  a dystopia on purpose. They've decided to build a dystopia. They want to build a
[11:51.960 --> 11:56.640]  dystopia. They say they're building a dystopia for us and to see the average
[11:56.640 --> 12:00.560]  ignorant person going along with it because they think it's trendy is very
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.720]  sad. It's like people being handed a razor blade by the globalist and they
[12:05.720 --> 12:11.520]  just slip their throat and say thank you Jeff Bezos. Thank you Hillary Clinton. It
[12:11.520 --> 12:17.360]  is just it's mind control. And so when we come back I'm gonna go through.
[12:17.360 --> 12:21.880]  Remember Hillary saying we're gonna contest no matter what and then Clinton
[12:21.880 --> 12:25.560]  with his gas Bill Clinton saying we need to use the military to get rid of him
[12:25.560 --> 12:30.240]  and then they're spitting it now saying Trump plans to stay in if he can test in
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.200]  any way. If he can test and says no we're not gonna count these fake ballots for
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.440]  two weeks two months which is what the law says they're gonna call that him
[12:41.440 --> 12:47.000]  losing the election and they've changed all the semantics here. I mean why not they
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.200]  can get us to call a man with a foot long genitals a woman and make nurses do
[12:54.200 --> 12:58.960]  pap smears on his cervix. We let convicted pedophiles have time with our
[12:58.960 --> 13:03.840]  kids in the public schools during drag queen story time so why not just define
[13:03.840 --> 13:07.600]  it that they say we're gonna scuttle the election we're gonna run the ship into
[13:07.600 --> 13:15.200]  the iceberg and then while it's sinking we're gonna blame it all on Trump but
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.560]  see how do we stop this we turn the ship beforehand we hit the streets we call
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.200]  Congress we surround the White House we surround the mainstream media they did
[13:25.200 --> 13:30.520]  the lockdown knowing our psychology knowing that conservatives and
[13:30.520 --> 13:33.280]  nationalists and patriots even if we don't agree with it will follow the law
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.680]  at least for a while and so we're locked in our houses we got masked over our
[13:37.680 --> 13:42.400]  faces muzzled while the Soros Antifa and Black Lives Matter are wearing their
[13:42.400 --> 13:45.920]  mask to go out and commit their crimes this is all been actuaryed they've
[13:45.920 --> 13:49.120]  looked at every angle of it and the one thing that defeats them is you hit the
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.520]  streets you using your telephones you online spread the word so they've
[13:54.520 --> 13:58.960]  already said they will implement the internet kill switch on the morning of
[13:58.960 --> 14:03.320]  the election they're already incrementally turning off the free speech
[14:03.320 --> 14:08.560]  picture it is like 2001 Space Odyssey where the astronauts turning off the
[14:08.560 --> 14:13.400]  Hal 9000 picture that is your speech and they're already I'm afraid Dave I'm
[14:13.400 --> 14:20.200]  afraid I was one of the first they turned off and it's all just I'm losing my
[14:20.200 --> 14:26.520]  ability to speak here Dave this is scary Dave until finally you're I'm being
[14:26.520 --> 14:34.120]  silent and then it's just incremental everyone including the president they
[14:34.120 --> 14:37.560]  said he won't be allowed to contest himself the news is going to say oh
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.520]  he's a liar his Twitter will be shut down and we're all just cruising right
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.440]  towards the damn iceberg dead center and the bad news when we come back the
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.360]  Republicans have taken the filthy mate they are so addled they are such stupid
[14:53.360 --> 14:56.920]  old lawyers who think they're still in the same system they have no idea they're
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.200]  faced with an extinction level event of the Republic and and the total
[15:02.200 --> 15:05.560]  overthrow of them they're soft they're a bunch of never chamber ones they're
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.760]  idiots we don't have Winston Churchill's in that Congress and and you know
[15:10.760 --> 15:15.720]  Trump's good but but he's not good enough he needs to attack massively and
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.840]  point out where we're going with this with fireside chats every night because
[15:20.840 --> 15:24.600]  I haven't gotten into the particulars yet I'll show you where they're saying it
[15:24.600 --> 15:30.240]  where they're doing it this is 100% clear this is happening like the Sun
[15:30.240 --> 15:33.840]  came up this morning and I'll go to the timeline with you and I'll tell you what's
[15:33.840 --> 15:39.840]  gonna happen during all of this so you think about that ladies and gentlemen
[15:39.840 --> 15:41.920]  and I'm not here to scare you I believe in you I think you're gonna do
[15:41.920 --> 15:45.880]  something about this I need everyone to go surround the White House with bull
[15:45.880 --> 15:51.240]  horns 24-7 bullhorning the president to stand up against this election before
[15:51.240 --> 15:59.560]  they do it it's gotta be done now now now now now now now the Renaissance the
[15:59.560 --> 16:05.320]  great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific
[16:05.320 --> 16:12.680]  tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the
[16:12.680 --> 16:17.960]  technocrats are above the law the public isn't even considered to be as
[16:17.960 --> 16:23.360]  valuable as a cow that humans are seen as garbage it's gonna be taken out and
[16:23.360 --> 16:29.000]  removed that is the post-human extremist plan that is the public
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.040]  ideology of the globalists and everything they've built with this high-tech
[16:33.040 --> 16:40.960]  grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any
[16:40.960 --> 16:44.600]  future generations that happen to strangle out of their mother's wounds
[16:44.600 --> 16:50.680]  will be a mere shadow of what humans once were this is the satanic ruling
[16:50.680 --> 16:56.240]  elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation humanity this is the
[16:56.240 --> 17:01.320]  essence of evil I've come to you many times and ask for your support and you've
[17:01.320 --> 17:05.760]  always come through and info wars has come through we've never sold out we've
[17:05.760 --> 17:11.840]  never backed down we've always told the truth we've made mistakes 98% of the time
[17:11.840 --> 17:17.320]  or so we're dead on and the enemy knows that info wars is a thought leader not
[17:17.320 --> 17:21.280]  just here but around the world and that's why the chai comms Hollywood the
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.040]  globalist won us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny and
[17:26.040 --> 17:30.680]  a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air if you don't support us
[17:30.680 --> 17:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen now they're going to shut info wars down and shut
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  everybody else down as well you already know that it's out of the open so again
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.360]  count the cost focus and realize how critical you are with your word of
[17:43.360 --> 17:46.400]  mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors your financial support
[17:46.400 --> 17:50.320]  getting the products info store.com and your prayer I'm praying for you please
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.280]  pray for us let's do this together we're gonna win we are winning but it's not
[17:54.280 --> 17:57.040]  gonna be easy the enemy's trying to take it all from us let's not let them
[17:57.040 --> 18:04.600]  succeed you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:16.960 --> 18:25.920]  well you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes and the
[18:25.920 --> 18:37.040]  chauffeur drives your cars you let everybody know but don't play with me
[18:37.040 --> 18:45.680]  because you're playing with fire. This is not a threat it's a warning the
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.800]  globalists are slaves to Satan they're following spiritual orders they know
[18:50.800 --> 18:55.440]  they're destroying themselves they're scared I'm warning those of you that
[18:55.440 --> 19:00.680]  aren't slaves you need to understand that this is a path towards destruction
[19:00.680 --> 19:06.960]  designed to have the United States fall and the Western model of peace and
[19:06.960 --> 19:11.520]  justice and prosperity to be destroyed on its ashes the technocracy is to be
[19:11.520 --> 19:19.560]  built we must turn back now we're going towards the iceberg the United States
[19:19.560 --> 19:25.400]  sinks the world will sink into a nightmare hell it's in all the Pentagon
[19:25.400 --> 19:29.480]  reports the British Ministry reports Rockefeller reports the criminals have
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.080]  been planning this all along please listen to me this is not science fiction
[19:34.080 --> 19:37.440]  you've seen everything I've told you come true so far because it's a battle
[19:37.440 --> 19:44.600]  plan it's a systematic takeover we're all gonna be engulfed by fire we can
[19:44.600 --> 19:51.320]  turn back now here's what Hillary had to say just a few months ago when she gave
[19:51.320 --> 19:57.800]  the orders my advice to Joe Biden in October campaign this obviously is do
[19:57.800 --> 20:03.800]  not concede under any circumstances because I believe the other side is
[20:03.800 --> 20:13.480]  going to cheat and and sneak and try to lose you know Joe Biden should not
[20:13.480 --> 20:19.960]  concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out and
[20:19.960 --> 20:27.000]  eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as
[20:27.000 --> 20:32.480]  focused and relentless as the other side is
[20:32.480 --> 20:46.640]  so there you go they're playing with fire let's get right into it they tried
[20:46.640 --> 20:51.560]  to get the military months ago in letters that were sent to Congress from
[20:51.560 --> 20:55.880]  Congress the Pentagon to say that we're gonna contest the election it's gonna
[20:55.880 --> 20:59.320]  take several months and you're gonna help us remove Trump if he doesn't let
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.640]  us hold it up for a few months which they'll then just use to create a huge
[21:03.640 --> 21:08.680]  crisis and have a bunch of states break away and have a secession movement that
[21:08.680 --> 21:12.880]  will end the dollar and cause a global depression that's already here and that's
[21:12.880 --> 21:15.880]  the plan of the lockdown that's the plan of all of this is a worldwide
[21:15.880 --> 21:18.920]  depression for the central banks to consolidate control it's a lot bigger
[21:18.920 --> 21:23.520]  than just America but they get us they got it all they can't carry out this
[21:23.520 --> 21:27.800]  predatory new world order and starve the third world to death 135 million the UN
[21:27.800 --> 21:32.840]  says starving to death because they're behind it they can't execute that of
[21:32.840 --> 21:38.840]  America still here we're going up to the guillotine in 38 days boys and girls
[21:38.840 --> 21:45.200]  your pensions your future your children your healthcare it's all gone people and
[21:45.200 --> 21:49.960]  this isn't a damn game everybody better get that straight now I know this
[21:49.960 --> 21:53.560]  audience is amazing people and you've heard me talk about this for years so we
[21:53.560 --> 21:58.400]  all kind of get a little normalcy bias where it's like somebody has cancer for
[21:58.400 --> 22:01.200]  a year they get ready to die they're kind of ready for it when it happens they're
[22:01.200 --> 22:05.000]  scared the first week shared the first month but you know I've had family and
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.640]  stuff that didn't play golf and stuff the last week of their life they're just
[22:07.640 --> 22:14.320]  healthy dead soon love you guys bye well we don't have to die as a country I've
[22:14.320 --> 22:17.880]  been living close to this so long I'm just used to everything myself well I
[22:17.880 --> 22:21.440]  decided I'm not gonna just get used to it I'm gonna fight harder than I've ever
[22:21.440 --> 22:26.720]  fought I made that decision this weekend my wife's like what's going on with you
[22:26.720 --> 22:30.920]  Sunday she's like man your eyes are sparkling and you you seem to have a
[22:30.920 --> 22:36.120]  lot more energy than you didn't I just said sweetheart it's all going down you
[22:36.120 --> 22:46.120]  see fight my eyes because it's on this is it and we're not getting conquered by
[22:46.120 --> 22:49.640]  like the Romans or something that would teach us how to read and write but in
[22:49.640 --> 22:55.560]  aqueducts sure we'd be slaves that's but they didn't want to you know just kill
[22:55.560 --> 22:59.840]  us routinely for fun I mean they'd throw people into gladiatorial events that
[22:59.840 --> 23:04.240]  men kill each other but they were corrupt and bad the globalist want you
[23:04.240 --> 23:09.800]  poisoned and and and dead they they just want to do evil they want to attack the
[23:09.800 --> 23:17.680]  family they want to attack men they're satanic so we're not getting captured by
[23:17.680 --> 23:20.600]  just like pole pot who just wanted to kill anybody that could read and write
[23:20.600 --> 23:23.080]  because you wanted to reprogram everybody that was bad enough he killed
[23:23.080 --> 23:27.680]  about 30% of the country and to bigger presence he helped finance that and
[23:27.680 --> 23:30.880]  bragged about it in one of his books I forget which one I read a bunch it was
[23:30.880 --> 23:36.360]  one of his earlier books he's like oh I didn't kill those Cambodians and but I
[23:36.360 --> 23:41.480]  sure helped pull pot do it and then that's why when he would go up to a CFR
[23:41.480 --> 23:44.920]  speech people shake and just worship him because the more blood you've got of
[23:44.920 --> 23:49.360]  children the more powerful you are in the satanic order as very presence he was
[23:49.360 --> 23:54.840]  a Dracula he wasn't a minion he was a big brain they liked him at the Rothschild
[23:54.840 --> 23:58.400]  Rockefeller Councils they they brought him in they said you are in command now
[23:58.400 --> 24:06.200]  Admiral he was a top-filled marshal now his wicked wicked dog daughter sits up
[24:06.200 --> 24:12.520]  there with murder and Joe every morning oh I'm sorry her brains were bashed out
[24:12.520 --> 24:15.960]  but you know what's Trump calling psycho Joe and I'm not murdering Joe that's
[24:15.960 --> 24:21.760]  the wrong nickname so that's who these people are and they like burning down
[24:21.760 --> 24:26.560]  your farms they like having your daughter die they love killing babies and
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.320]  as soon as you get that through your head and understand giving into these
[24:31.320 --> 24:34.480]  people kissing their ass doesn't make them go away and by the way I had to
[24:34.480 --> 24:37.720]  learn that I never really kiss their butt and I'm like oh the Wachowski brothers
[24:37.720 --> 24:40.600]  both want to cut the testicles off and say they're women I don't care I'm a
[24:40.600 --> 24:44.360]  libertarian but I didn't get no no no we're going to teach your son how to do
[24:44.360 --> 24:47.280]  it now you're gonna give it we're gonna we're gonna get access to your son
[24:47.280 --> 24:53.640]  because it's about destroying humanity oh now it's a sacrament it's a religion
[24:53.760 --> 24:58.240]  now I get what's going on no now I have to oppose you you see because I kept
[24:58.240 --> 25:04.040]  underestimating the conversion level of evil but see the conversion level of
[25:04.040 --> 25:07.400]  evil is like a domino the first domino you hit you've got thousands of
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.800]  dominoes lined up it you know in slow motion it doesn't look like it's that
[25:12.800 --> 25:16.680]  big enough to till you go out of slow motion into regular motion and it's
[25:16.680 --> 25:21.960]  just going down now the dominoes are falling most people are followers
[25:21.960 --> 25:28.920]  they're mesmerized by TV and they are spiritually taking on the spirit of the
[25:28.920 --> 25:35.800]  world as humans are psychic we have an electromagnetic chemical connection it's
[25:35.800 --> 25:39.040]  not been mathematically proven they know it they're using the cell towers and all
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.840]  that CID classified in the late 90s to manipulate our emotions that's what the
[25:43.840 --> 25:52.440]  movies like Kingsman's all about and they're playing God ladies and gentlemen
[25:52.560 --> 25:55.880]  and that's why you get a bunch of men together about to get in the fight they
[25:55.880 --> 25:59.440]  get all crazed and they're using one that's the real crazed one that's like
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.560]  the you know the war leader that has the spirit that's a resonance or it's the
[26:04.560 --> 26:07.880]  same way we're like an orgy that's a sexual resonance or it's the same thing
[26:07.880 --> 26:12.320]  in a pep rally our team you're feeling like what is this that isn't just the
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.880]  cold night air and the and oh it's the tribalism of the two sides and they
[26:17.880 --> 26:22.600]  are invoking all of that and using all of that and they have converted the
[26:22.600 --> 26:30.200]  general public into walking selfish monsters who are so stupid they'll
[26:30.200 --> 26:34.440]  destroy their own nest and not even know they did it let me stop this the
[26:34.440 --> 26:41.400]  most important information ever we're cruising towards the iceberg the 38th
[26:41.400 --> 26:47.000]  days is when we hit the iceberg and then if we have it pre-positioned before
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.680]  that the ship will go down in the days after that it's inauguration it's 117
[26:53.680 --> 27:00.240]  117 stay with us remember the global lockdowns you're witnessing the black
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.080]  lives matter antifer riots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly
[27:05.080 --> 27:10.760]  directed by a handful of top billionaires led by people like Bill Gates
[27:10.760 --> 27:16.800]  Jeff Bezos of course Tim Cook and others they set up there with their
[27:16.800 --> 27:20.800]  trillions of dollars they control in their companies and their hundreds of
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.760]  billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to
[27:25.760 --> 27:30.460]  create an artificial revolution against local government and police and the
[27:30.460 --> 27:34.360]  mayors are again they're playing their political game try to trigger the
[27:34.360 --> 27:37.720]  complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe show these
[27:37.720 --> 27:41.360]  billionaires could come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar that's
[27:41.360 --> 27:44.640]  why I'm so angry at these globalists because when you're looking at them
[27:44.640 --> 27:48.320]  they're the ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.000]  plans against us they are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with it's
[27:53.000 --> 28:00.880]  us or them period and perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his
[28:00.880 --> 28:08.120]  way the complications from COVID-19 what you're well beyond what they should be
[28:08.120 --> 28:14.560]  it's estimated them 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish
[28:14.560 --> 28:19.200]  this talk Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar part of the
[28:19.200 --> 28:25.480]  establishment for close to 50 years but now boy as his brain degenerates we are
[28:25.480 --> 28:31.000]  seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage of the world the 2020
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.120]  election there are 370 million people in the United States if 200 million died
[28:36.120 --> 28:40.680]  from COVID that'd be more than half of the population when not even one tenth
[28:40.680 --> 28:45.200]  of one percent have actually died but him putting these giant lies and these
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.560]  incredibly brain damage statements out is emblematic of the general public
[28:49.560 --> 28:55.560]  being in a trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre
[28:55.560 --> 28:59.520]  if you look at the top tech billionaires in the big banks that finance and
[28:59.520 --> 29:03.720]  control them to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many people on
[29:03.720 --> 29:07.160]  the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain
[29:07.160 --> 29:11.760]  top or a national park they have to look at us the common people they have to look
[29:11.760 --> 29:15.560]  at the proletariat they have to look at the scum that's why they love the lock
[29:15.560 --> 29:19.320]  down putting muzzles on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we
[29:19.320 --> 29:24.560]  can go what we can do bankrupting main street bankrupting small towns all of
[29:24.560 --> 29:28.760]  it is a vertical integration consolidation so they can then dictate the
[29:28.760 --> 29:33.120]  terms of our total surrender which is taking sterilant vaccines in day one
[29:33.120 --> 29:38.400]  ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they used all
[29:38.400 --> 29:42.360]  entertainment garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders moving in
[29:42.360 --> 29:46.840]  for the kill you know this I know this it's all out in the open the question is
[29:46.840 --> 29:50.040]  what are we gonna do about it well the first thing is identify the enemy
[29:50.040 --> 29:56.240]  identify the enemy identify the enemy identify your enemy now
[29:56.240 --> 30:07.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:07.040 --> 30:31.800]  244 let's talk numbers that's when the republic came out of God's loins that's
[30:31.800 --> 30:36.680]  what we got a nice slap on the ass for that war with the British Empire and
[30:36.680 --> 30:43.440]  now here we are we're not a baby anymore the most powerful country the world we
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.240]  have the most inventions we have the spark of the creator but where there is
[30:47.240 --> 30:54.800]  God's power Satan comes in to try to take control so we are 244 years old and
[30:54.800 --> 31:00.000]  you can put on our tombstone 117 days from now they get Joe Biden in there it's
[31:00.000 --> 31:05.760]  a very good chance we'll never recover from it I'm not trying to demoralize
[31:05.760 --> 31:08.440]  them he's telling you like it is I think you understand I'm not exaggerating I
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.640]  think you already know what I'm saying it's true because you already figured it
[31:10.640 --> 31:19.040]  out now how many days is that that's 79 days after the election that we have to
[31:19.040 --> 31:24.400]  deal with living hell because everything you've seen is a beta test in is a
[31:24.400 --> 31:35.800]  prelude an hors d'oeuvre mere skirmishes compared to what you and I and all of us
[31:35.800 --> 31:39.960]  have front row seats to and if you sit there in the seats that's the most
[31:39.960 --> 31:46.600]  dangerous place to be because the seats are the worst part of your arena you
[31:46.600 --> 31:54.120]  have to be on the field and you don't want to get on the field in the middle
[31:54.120 --> 31:58.680]  of the battle you want to show up at the start of the battle oh there's gonna be
[31:58.680 --> 32:03.960]  folks once they figure out how bad it is they'll show up at the end of the battle
[32:04.560 --> 32:11.200]  but they're so easily controlled who knows if they'll even do that and here's
[32:11.200 --> 32:17.240]  an example and I don't say this to act elitist I don't say this to talk about
[32:17.240 --> 32:22.920]  my gravitas or my intelligence it's not that I get in the mind of what the
[32:22.920 --> 32:27.360]  Bible says a fallen entity on this planet not of this world that wants to
[32:27.360 --> 32:32.320]  destroy us but has to do it through our free will has to convince us to do it
[32:32.320 --> 32:38.920]  to ourselves like the Star Trek episode where there's the alien on the ship and
[32:38.920 --> 32:43.120]  everybody to kill each other and everybody coming together is the way to
[32:43.120 --> 32:48.320]  stop it and that's what it is and most the globalists they don't make fun of
[32:48.320 --> 32:51.160]  that they know they go yeah we're we're dolled into the you know the winning
[32:51.160 --> 32:55.120]  team the Jeff Bezos look at you know look at Warren Buffett look at Bill
[32:55.120 --> 32:58.040]  Gates while they're on the winning team take one look at those guys those aren't
[32:58.040 --> 33:04.520]  winners those are losers so you can call it what you want God the devil what
[33:04.520 --> 33:11.240]  whatever it is transmission that's what's going on and they need this country
[33:11.240 --> 33:15.800]  to fall to bring in their nightmare world government and so why am I so
[33:15.800 --> 33:20.080]  upset today I come in here and you know I get I stay up at night and I get up
[33:20.080 --> 33:23.000]  early in the morning at like 5 a.m. and I just read what they're saying and I see
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.880]  what's fed on to my so-called iPhone a little tracking device a little
[33:26.880 --> 33:32.400]  sinister globalist device and I see it flooding my the force-fed news feed that
[33:32.400 --> 33:37.880]  well military might have to take Trump out conversely oh Trump's running at the
[33:37.880 --> 33:46.000]  military to steal the election oh Trump said he's not gonna go along with the
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.720]  election results and you read about let's not exaggerate I looked at about 40
[33:52.720 --> 33:56.360]  articles only read two or three of them fully through because I didn't need to I
[33:56.360 --> 33:58.920]  knew it all first came out of Atlantic Monthly where they put the talking
[33:58.920 --> 34:03.560]  points out and then they just regurgitated and rewrite everywhere over
[34:03.560 --> 34:07.440]  and over again so I've got just in my stack probably ten different articles
[34:07.440 --> 34:11.160]  that all read exactly the same which whenever you're reading that it might
[34:11.160 --> 34:14.520]  concern you a little bit because that means that's not really that author doing
[34:14.520 --> 34:19.760]  that this is this is beyond fake news this is concerted Pentagon directed fake
[34:19.760 --> 34:23.640]  news and it's not the Pentagon people themselves it's the systems that Obama
[34:23.640 --> 34:28.880]  and Hillary are still in control of and that Trump's trying to get control of
[34:28.880 --> 34:32.000]  but you heard Trump executive order do not teach that white people are
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.680]  inherently evil in federal training courses for 13 weeks each year federal
[34:35.680 --> 34:41.160]  agency said f off we're doing it and went forward and Trump fires the head of
[34:41.160 --> 34:44.440]  that agency the next person says I'm ready to get fired too because it's
[34:44.440 --> 34:50.400]  spiritual service to the destruction of the country these people believe they're
[34:50.400 --> 34:53.600]  gonna win they believe they're gonna have positions of real power over
[34:53.600 --> 34:58.840]  American Christians whence the country falls and it is that reckoning and that
[34:58.840 --> 35:02.880]  attack on our children that they desire spiritually they've got to get rid of
[35:02.880 --> 35:10.080]  the Republic to get to the children so imagine them like zombies that want
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.640]  brains you're like hey I got a refrigerator full of food here brains
[35:14.640 --> 35:20.160]  because the allegory is they're fallen it's a spiritual allegory they need your
[35:20.160 --> 35:25.920]  brain they need your soul they need your essence they don't have it they want to
[35:25.920 --> 35:32.520]  kill the living so zombies and vampires and all of this play is very real to us
[35:32.520 --> 35:37.680]  even though the allegory is fake the archetype is real these are zombies when
[35:37.680 --> 35:41.560]  you go out and see leftist and they've converted and those of us that aren't
[35:41.560 --> 35:45.240]  under their spirit are alive and sparkling even we're old or even if
[35:45.240 --> 35:49.000]  we're crippled or whatever we still have it they don't have the essence and they
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.240]  want us gone they want to club our head in and then they'll just sit down next
[35:54.240 --> 36:01.200]  to our dead body on the street and go that's all they want they only activate
[36:01.200 --> 36:07.280]  to destroy you Hitler before he killed himself said I just did all this because
[36:07.280 --> 36:13.080]  I wanted to blow things up and kill people the journey was beautiful for him
[36:13.080 --> 36:17.360]  same thing with linen they said sir these cities aren't resisting no one of
[36:17.360 --> 36:22.360]  the towns is resisting you know these are serfs under the czar none of them
[36:22.360 --> 36:26.840]  are fighting you sir he said I don't care kill kill 30% of them kill all the
[36:26.840 --> 36:32.640]  Christians find out who the most devout Christians are and kill them because he
[36:32.640 --> 36:37.880]  was he was a Satanist on record who would flop around on the ground and go I
[36:37.880 --> 36:42.720]  want more blood just go I want blood I want blood and just flop blood blood he
[36:42.720 --> 36:45.840]  was screaming yell to start chewing the carpet they say yes sir he say I'll have
[36:45.840 --> 36:50.560]  you tortured to death in your family unless you kill more people Satan wants
[36:50.560 --> 36:58.680]  more blood you saw Chuckie Schumer when Trump was talking about getting the
[36:58.680 --> 37:01.880]  Supreme Court nominee in and stopping abortion and he got up there and finally
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.000]  showed some anger he said you don't stop that or I swear you'll go down we're
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.920]  gonna we're gonna take you out and he meant it to me he's I need that blood I
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.000]  need those are needed those people are devil worshippers Chuckie Schumer gets
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.760]  on his knees in a pentagram he's surrounded his protege was Anthony
[37:19.760 --> 37:25.280]  Weiner a child molester pure cure of children when you look into Chuck Schumer's
[37:25.280 --> 37:32.800]  eyes you just see the simmering burning fires of hell okay I'm gonna be good I'm
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.040]  gonna come back and do news excuse me and play all these clips you know Rob
[37:37.040 --> 37:39.800]  Dew runs and he goes I've got a seven-minute super cut of all the
[37:39.800 --> 37:42.800]  Democrats in they're gonna contest the election overthrow Trump and take our
[37:42.800 --> 37:46.360]  free speech and lock down all of our accounts and I'm like okay we could air
[37:46.360 --> 37:49.800]  that but more importantly let's just give the video a name post it demand
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.720]  out video and call it what Democrats video Democrats admit plan to steal the
[37:53.720 --> 37:58.000]  election trigger civil war let's put that headline back up of the show today
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.160]  with a live feed hopefully you'll share it red alert red alert red alert never
[38:02.160 --> 38:08.120]  seen me say red alert red alert much less red alert red alert red alert I've
[38:08.120 --> 38:11.000]  been putting these headlines out for more than 20 years I never said more than
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.760]  one red alert red alert red alert red alert but I mean I could say red alert
[38:15.760 --> 38:19.840]  red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert
[38:19.840 --> 38:27.040]  red alert red alert this is not the normal time they're scared they know
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.080]  humanity's waking up they know Christ's energy is coming back on the planet and
[38:30.080 --> 38:36.440]  they want to make their dirty move on you and your family now and believe me
[38:36.440 --> 38:41.040]  when Trump says hey they don't like me but they really hate you because they're
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.520]  trying to get through me to get to you it's totally true when you see their
[38:44.520 --> 38:48.160]  hatred of me that's their hatred of you because they believe the spirit of this
[38:48.160 --> 38:52.200]  broadcast represents what they fear and that's people that are fearless in the
[38:52.200 --> 38:56.040]  face of their evil and committed because God is in us I was thinking about this
[38:56.040 --> 39:01.080]  morning sure America's got problems and it's been under attack and all that
[39:01.080 --> 39:04.480]  that we recognize that we were special because of the ideals of freedom and
[39:04.480 --> 39:08.040]  because of our true Christian founding something the establishment attached as
[39:08.040 --> 39:14.440]  they know it's the heart of our power and I'm an American I come out of a long
[39:14.440 --> 39:21.280]  saga and a long struggle of 244 years and before that but it doesn't matter
[39:21.280 --> 39:24.000]  that my family on both sides was on the Mayflower it doesn't matter they were
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.600]  the Revolutionary War does better they fought under George Washington doesn't
[39:26.600 --> 39:30.800]  matter they led the defense at the Alamo it doesn't matter because it was the
[39:30.800 --> 39:33.720]  American system that was an example of the other fights around the world and
[39:33.720 --> 39:36.760]  all of you if you just got here five years ago and you love America you're
[39:36.760 --> 39:42.600]  part of that idea because it's 1776 worldwide against their Satanism but
[39:42.600 --> 39:50.080]  telling you if we fail in this the only sick silver lining is that all the scum
[39:50.080 --> 39:54.160]  that hated America so much are gonna be absolutely starving to death in the
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.600]  streets we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.520]  horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation but the good
[40:02.520 --> 40:07.560]  news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well the general public all
[40:07.560 --> 40:12.560]  over the planet hate Bill Gates he's the most unpopular person on earth
[40:12.560 --> 40:17.400]  people know he's not a doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.680]  knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses
[40:21.680 --> 40:27.120]  polio sterilence and more it's even in the associated press so now they're
[40:27.120 --> 40:31.400]  beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate
[40:31.400 --> 40:36.040]  global government and the beast top-tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide
[40:36.040 --> 40:40.480]  to pull the type of race war scams the coronavirus scams that we're witnessing
[40:40.480 --> 40:45.920]  so remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've
[40:45.920 --> 40:50.520]  done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization they are
[40:50.520 --> 40:57.320]  the enemies of humanity they want you dead servants of Satan are working around
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.480]  the clock to silence people of not just the United States but of the world
[41:01.480 --> 41:05.080]  because there is a great awakening taking place everyone I talked to
[41:05.080 --> 41:10.200]  everywhere I go people that weren't even religious or spiritual now understand
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.200]  this fight between good and evil and they're finding Christ and they're
[41:14.200 --> 41:18.760]  finding the prophecies that aren't like Nostradamus they but are very very
[41:18.760 --> 41:25.120]  detailed extremely specific that are now coming through at a frightening rate
[41:25.120 --> 41:30.000]  frightening because so many people are still living under the control of the
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.560]  God of this world Satan did not realize that their immortal souls are in grave
[41:35.560 --> 41:42.120]  danger do not fear you can kill the body fear he who can kill the soul as the
[41:42.120 --> 41:46.320]  good book warns us I'm Alex Jones and I'm very honored to be on air still during
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.080]  this time every day we're still on there as a blessing so please pray for him
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.760]  for worse pray for yourself pray for the children pray for the world God bless you
[41:53.760 --> 42:00.720]  all in the area during a pandemic we look to local health authorities so for
[42:00.720 --> 42:06.320]  example in the US it would be CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.560]  in a narrow way which could cause harm in the real world that was a few months
[42:10.560 --> 42:15.400]  ago in the CEO of Google Sundar Pachai made a very important statement all the
[42:15.400 --> 42:18.600]  other big tech ads met the exact same statement because it comes out of the
[42:18.600 --> 42:24.040]  event that they follow the guidance of the WHO and or local government what
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.080]  they mean is the United States other world cities that have been unionized
[42:28.080 --> 42:31.760]  whether they've actually signed on the UN memorandums and agreements so what he
[42:31.760 --> 42:35.240]  saying is oh we follow the United Nations our global government and then
[42:35.240 --> 42:39.560]  we've got little stakeholder parents that's how the UN works that then give
[42:39.560 --> 42:43.560]  the illusion of it being local but then when your doctors or your scientists
[42:43.560 --> 42:47.880]  your virologists come out and say that COVID-19 is massively exaggerated the
[42:47.880 --> 42:52.280]  power grab they get silenced their press conferences get muzzled just like they
[42:52.280 --> 42:56.800]  do in communist China that's what's really going on here the planets have
[42:56.800 --> 43:01.400]  aligned globally they've aligned nationally they've aligned financially
[43:01.400 --> 43:06.840]  culturally but most importantly spiritually we are living at a point in
[43:06.840 --> 43:11.720]  human development that's beside the entire future destiny of our species so
[43:11.720 --> 43:16.760]  that's why big tech control of the very dark forces the globalist is trying to
[43:16.760 --> 43:22.360]  dumb us down isolate us make us to press make us alone and try to control
[43:22.360 --> 43:26.480]  every aspect of our lives literally rain washing us with the stimuli that they
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.560]  look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright not just of
[43:30.560 --> 43:36.240]  Americana but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment they
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.320]  are trying to create a new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.280]  life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.880]  carbon credits and through a social credit score this is their plan we must
[43:50.880 --> 43:56.760]  come together and awaken out of our trance and say no we mustn't race God
[43:56.760 --> 44:14.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:26.760 --> 44:39.600]  welcome back on your host Alex Jones this is a maximum red alert red alert
[44:39.600 --> 44:47.600]  red alert okay let me just try to boil this down as best I can it's not just
[44:47.600 --> 44:52.000]  that we already knew all this and we've got hours of footage of the Democrats
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.480]  preparing everyone for this they tried to go to the military quietly in the last
[44:56.480 --> 45:00.520]  couple years publicly the last six months and get the military to say we're
[45:00.520 --> 45:05.840]  gonna contest the election if he can test that you then have to remove him and
[45:05.840 --> 45:09.560]  they said no way that's illegal that's for Congress and the Supreme Court to
[45:09.560 --> 45:14.400]  decide which is just true so then the Democrats kind of shut up for a while
[45:14.400 --> 45:17.960]  and then as Trump started busting them all over the country federal and state
[45:17.960 --> 45:24.400]  involved in massive ballot harvesting voter fraud you name it that stacks of
[45:24.400 --> 45:28.840]  it here today they then came out with talking points out of the Atlantic
[45:28.840 --> 45:34.920]  that were then parroted everywhere last night today so this is their plan that
[45:34.920 --> 45:40.200]  they're gonna conflate and confuse it all even more and again they will
[45:40.200 --> 45:48.040]  contest and then no matter what the election results even show they will
[45:48.040 --> 45:54.200]  just continue to contest and they will have governors and Democrat states with
[45:54.200 --> 45:58.280]  Nancy Pelosi announced that they are breaking up part of the country and it's
[45:58.280 --> 46:02.440]  the realization that they're gonna do that I mean they proposed it months ago
[46:02.440 --> 46:08.440]  she said I've met with continuity of government I will be in second command you
[46:08.440 --> 46:11.600]  we might impeach him during the election and then she just says well but
[46:11.600 --> 46:17.000]  doesn't matter Pence will step aside I mean all this is illegal and so it's
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.680]  really this it's the realization that they're gonna go ahead with it and I
[46:23.680 --> 46:27.360]  agree with Rush Limbaugh I never got to this clip two days ago maybe pull it up
[46:27.360 --> 46:32.120]  took 50 seconds long but he just said we need to dispense with the hearings if
[46:32.120 --> 46:35.960]  people have already been vetted they're already on circuit courts and the
[46:35.960 --> 46:38.480]  Democrats wouldn't give us hearings now there's gonna use it to bring forward a
[46:38.480 --> 46:42.400]  bunch of liars and they have the votes and so you don't even need to have the
[46:42.400 --> 46:47.960]  committee hearings just don't even have those because Democrats aren't Americans
[46:47.960 --> 46:51.520]  they they believe in the end of the country they believe in the collapse of
[46:51.520 --> 46:55.000]  the dollar they believe in the destruction of local government they
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.720]  literally believe in death to America and people go oh that's the radical left
[46:59.720 --> 47:06.320]  no that's the conquerors don't look at the scum that they were able to recruit
[47:06.320 --> 47:08.920]  that's just because good people won't join them and then think they're weak
[47:08.920 --> 47:13.200]  they're strong Jeff Bezos says I'm proud of funding black lives matter and if you
[47:13.200 --> 47:16.560]  don't like it don't buy on Amazon
[47:16.560 --> 47:23.160]  I mean it came out national file last night great website went viral oh my
[47:23.160 --> 47:26.840]  gosh did you know the black lives matter group that was handing out stuff in
[47:26.840 --> 47:34.760]  Louisville was also funded by not just George Soros but it was also funded by
[47:34.760 --> 47:43.280]  Bill Gates they all work together of course it's Bill Gates and so I'm
[47:43.280 --> 47:47.320]  always remembering that people don't know they're the people are awake now so if
[47:47.320 --> 47:50.520]  I haven't covered something in a while I'll see like text messages or emails or
[47:50.520 --> 47:54.400]  calls why don't you cover the Federal Reserve's private something like beating
[47:54.400 --> 47:59.000]  the dead horse for 20 something years and oh yeah okay yeah that's true or
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.800]  Jones he's talking more about the pedophile rings like saying Elvis you
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.440]  know needs to sing more rock and roll music but I get it because I'm always
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.560]  moving forward to the next thing people are like freaking out going Bill Gates
[48:12.560 --> 48:18.560]  gave hundreds of millions to Antifa and BLM well you're damn right he did and so
[48:18.560 --> 48:21.800]  you think about that this guy that wants to kill black people wants to kill
[48:21.800 --> 48:25.760]  old people wants to kill poor people
[48:28.680 --> 48:39.240]  caught giving people all these diseases worldwide polio you name it cancer
[48:39.240 --> 48:46.000]  they put cancer viruses in it and he funds a group called black lives matter
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.920]  run by three witches their Marxist Leninus and their main code is get rid of
[48:49.920 --> 48:55.120]  the nuclear family and have black men cut their balls off hey I'm I represent
[48:55.120 --> 48:59.400]  the black people black men chop your balls off I mean come on that's but
[48:59.400 --> 49:04.520]  again it's the psychology of it's over the top like Amazon is now launching a
[49:04.520 --> 49:09.680]  drone in your house that watches you because that's the holy grail is robots
[49:09.680 --> 49:12.680]  in your house controlling you always told you that but now they just do it
[49:12.680 --> 49:18.440]  you're like well that's over the top all of this is over the top people so just
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.080]  let me explain something when I know I'm right I know I'm right I don't think
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.360]  you need to tell you this but I'm explain something ladies and gentlemen we
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.040]  cannot let them contest the election and I understand they're gonna do it and
[49:30.040 --> 49:33.960]  they're gonna sit there and promote these ballots that they've got all stored
[49:33.960 --> 49:37.760]  up to mail in the last day Democrats are bragging about it they know what
[49:37.760 --> 49:40.960]  they're doing and they've gotten away with it with the Russia gate they've
[49:40.960 --> 49:44.600]  gotten away with the Ukraine gate they've gotten away with the lawfare
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.400]  garbage they've gotten away with terrorizing people I saw footage and
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.880]  I'm gonna get to it next hour I ended up waking up like 4 30 this morning and I
[49:54.880 --> 49:58.560]  spent an hour watching this because it was like a sick form of soap opera but
[49:58.560 --> 50:01.680]  it was a very upsetting reading the comments on Twitter and I probably watch
[50:01.680 --> 50:07.120]  30 videos I probably sit 15 to the poor crew or like what do we do with all this
[50:07.120 --> 50:14.360]  of LA and black lives matter we're here to help we don't want black families we
[50:14.360 --> 50:17.520]  want your testicles I mean don't want families don't want testicles that means
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.520]  we don't want black people hey get rid of your families and your balls we love
[50:21.520 --> 50:27.760]  you this is ridiculous like aliens land we're here to help you you can't have
[50:27.760 --> 50:37.160]  families give us your balls give us your warriors balls as a sign of submission
[50:37.160 --> 50:44.120]  give me your balls I mean it's and then he's dumbed down idiots raised on TV and
[50:44.120 --> 50:48.600]  all the hip-hop people owned by the globalists just doing this to them you
[50:48.600 --> 50:52.120]  know I thought of some of the biggest quote rock stars out there and they
[50:52.120 --> 50:54.240]  told me the stories that I can't say their names people can probably put two
[50:54.240 --> 50:57.880]  and two together has been on the show but I've had four or five big famous rock
[50:57.880 --> 51:03.360]  stars on the show and they all told me that they were all top in the early
[51:03.360 --> 51:10.000]  1990s and then MTV called them in and they said Sumner Redstone says we're
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.320]  gonna get rid of all this empowerment rap hip-hop stuff we're gonna have
[51:14.320 --> 51:19.240]  gangster cop killer music and you're all gonna promote these bands if you're
[51:19.240 --> 51:24.520]  gonna get played so suddenly you saw you know all the big bands whether it was
[51:24.520 --> 51:28.080]  mega death or whether it was you know smashing pumpkins or whether whatever
[51:28.080 --> 51:31.520]  these bands were all of them were told you're all the new bands now with the
[51:31.520 --> 51:36.400]  hip-hop people but with the but with the death kill the cop people and that was
[51:36.400 --> 51:40.040]  just marking black people to get killed by the cops and get taken over I mean
[51:40.040 --> 51:44.120]  Sumner Redstone wasn't trying to help black people let me tell you so that's
[51:44.120 --> 51:48.240]  what he took over empowering black music he got rid of all the other rock and
[51:48.240 --> 51:52.840]  roll because that was the old party have fun shit on your wife stuff that was
[51:52.840 --> 51:58.320]  phase one now it's let's go out and kill the cops to set up the culture you see
[51:58.320 --> 52:04.880]  now that's playing 10 12 14 moves ahead so last night I'm sitting there
[52:04.880 --> 52:09.280]  watching what was going on this morning I got up and was going on Paul losses
[52:09.280 --> 52:12.320]  Twitter and all the rest of it just watching the videos of like a guy pulls
[52:12.320 --> 52:15.760]  up in a truck they start trying to rip the doors open bashing it he drives they
[52:15.760 --> 52:19.400]  try to kill him he drives away a priest is trying to drive they sort of tacking
[52:19.400 --> 52:24.120]  it it drives through there's chopper footage it runs away they the antifa
[52:24.120 --> 52:28.240]  BLM's got trucks they drive in front of it like Road Warrior run it off the road
[52:28.240 --> 52:31.880]  do a pretty good job like they were trained to do it and another Mustang
[52:31.880 --> 52:38.520]  blocks it in then everybody on Twitter says kill him kill him kill him and they
[52:38.520 --> 52:43.920]  go good cops good and they and then they arrest the person in the priest they're
[52:43.920 --> 52:50.440]  attacking and again you'll watch this Prius get blocked in by the black truck
[52:50.440 --> 52:53.840]  radio listeners gotta go see it in fours calm and then the green Mustang slams
[52:53.840 --> 52:57.080]  in the back and this is like a Road Warrior this is somebody they're just
[52:57.080 --> 53:01.920]  attacking and then oh the police virtue signal and put them in handcuffs later
[53:01.920 --> 53:04.280]  they had to release them because it was clear they're under attack I mean you've
[53:04.280 --> 53:07.840]  got a mob trying to kill you trying to pull you out of your car for no reason
[53:07.840 --> 53:11.560]  you speed away in fear normal normal move and then they drive down the road
[53:11.560 --> 53:15.520]  almost killing everybody pull in and block you with police tactics another
[53:15.520 --> 53:19.200]  car comes in it's full of people in the back that jump out and start bashing the
[53:19.200 --> 53:23.120]  windows out and then when the car drives off everybody's on Twitter going kill
[53:23.120 --> 53:27.040]  them kill them they're assaulting us I mean they don't even know who's in that
[53:27.040 --> 53:36.240]  car but that's who the servants of Satan are idiots I'm gonna go to break I'll
[53:36.240 --> 53:39.480]  lay all this out I got the big drone news we'll do something special next hour
[53:39.480 --> 53:41.960]  I'm gonna leave it at that we got some special guests as well you want to stay
[53:41.960 --> 53:48.360]  with us this could be your some of the crew I was talking to Ben his family
[53:48.360 --> 53:51.480]  called another day their listeners they go Ben is everything okay Alex says we
[53:51.480 --> 53:56.800]  can be shut down I said well you got a good family but let me just clarify the
[53:56.800 --> 53:59.800]  whole country's getting shut down the whole world the third world's already
[53:59.800 --> 54:03.160]  starving to death yeah I'm in big trouble you're in big trouble we're the same
[54:03.160 --> 54:07.440]  boat you understand that right oh yeah you they're breathing down
[54:07.440 --> 54:10.280]  our neck bad oh absolutely I mean everything's falling apart man the
[54:10.280 --> 54:12.840]  supply chains are all breaking down we're acting to get the products to sell
[54:12.840 --> 54:16.040]  them to you everything we've got we've got the stock but nobody can get his
[54:16.040 --> 54:19.320]  stuff anymore because everybody's shut down people didn't come back to work in
[54:19.320 --> 54:24.360]  most areas after they said the lockdown was over their ending civilization
[54:24.360 --> 54:31.240]  gas is running out of the tank millions are dying and then we're just up here on
[54:31.240 --> 54:34.800]  this mountain as the water rises thinking we're okay it's gonna get to us
[54:34.800 --> 54:38.160]  too so get your products get your storeable food while you still can one
[54:38.160 --> 54:41.840]  or two weeks to ship get it before the election info or store.com you know
[54:41.840 --> 54:48.800]  it's good for you you notice that over and over again the United Nations are
[54:48.800 --> 54:52.480]  supposed controllers and bosses the great arbiter of truth that no one's
[54:52.480 --> 54:57.120]  allowed to disagree with has come out and said nothing can treat or prevent
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.120]  COVID-19. Ladies and gentlemen that's a total lie you get a lot of sunlight it's
[55:02.120 --> 55:06.880]  on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3 and it's almost impossible to get
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.320]  viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3 if you have zinc
[55:10.320 --> 55:14.000]  and vitamin C as well that's why people get the flus and these colds in the
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.360]  winter because that's a vitamin D levels plunge now I pointed this out and the
[55:18.360 --> 55:22.800]  media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope and that people
[55:22.800 --> 55:26.200]  should have their vitamins and their minerals well now Fauci's been forced to
[55:26.200 --> 55:30.840]  come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C he should have also added zinc
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.160]  because the NIH website says you die without zinc but it's good news that
[55:35.160 --> 55:38.760]  he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors and
[55:38.760 --> 55:42.160]  nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not
[55:42.160 --> 55:47.160]  been warning the public to get their vitamins. Last week Tucker Carlson came
[55:47.160 --> 55:51.720]  out and said America is becoming the Soviet Union in many ways we're worse
[55:51.720 --> 55:55.640]  than the Soviet Union the Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do
[55:55.640 --> 55:59.840]  surveilling and censoring us and we're gonna get a lot worse than the Soviet
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.000]  Union when it comes to forced inoculations and the medical tyranny
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.400]  being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what you can and can't
[56:07.400 --> 56:11.360]  say online the truth is ladies and gentlemen America is fighting for its
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.000]  life and the enemy's number one mission is to get Trump out of office and
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.160]  number two is to silence inforce because we understand just how
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.400]  diabolical they are just how evil they are and we won't miss words we know who
[56:25.400 --> 56:28.280]  the globalist are we've got their number and we know how to beat them and we
[56:28.280 --> 56:32.880]  cover it seven days a week live at info wars and it's only because of your
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.560]  support so keep spreading the word keep praying for us and take advantage of the
[56:36.560 --> 56:40.440]  sales and get great products at info wars store.com now the globalists are
[56:40.440 --> 56:44.520]  hoping you don't visit info wars store.com
[56:48.120 --> 56:53.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[56:53.520 --> 57:00.320]  one of the things that I think we and and other media need to start doing is
[57:00.320 --> 57:06.360]  preparing the American people that there's nothing illegitimate about this
[57:06.360 --> 57:10.440]  election taking additional days or even weeks to make sure that all the votes
[57:10.440 --> 57:13.560]  are counted in fact that might be important to make sure that this is a
[57:13.560 --> 57:18.360]  legitimate and fair election. The reason we talk about a red mirage is in fact
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.240]  because we believe that on election night we are going to see Donald Trump in a
[57:22.240 --> 57:28.240]  stronger position than the reality actually is. We are sounding an alarm and
[57:28.240 --> 57:31.760]  saying that this is a very real possibility that the data is going to
[57:31.760 --> 57:35.480]  show on election night an incredible victory for Donald Trump. You know Joe
[57:35.480 --> 57:41.400]  Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is
[57:41.400 --> 57:47.600]  gonna drag out and eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an
[57:47.600 --> 57:53.920]  inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is. You
[57:53.920 --> 57:59.360]  have a result on election night where it appears that Donald Trump has won but a
[57:59.360 --> 58:05.000]  result after ballots are counted that show that Joe Biden has actually won.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.080]  That's right we essentially built a simulator where it's a sequence of
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.880]  sliders and you just pull those sliders to start seeing what the scenarios will
[58:12.880 --> 58:15.800]  show you. What's it gonna look like on election night? What's it gonna look like
[58:15.800 --> 58:19.280]  the day after and the day after that and the day after that. So if one of the
[58:19.280 --> 58:25.800]  candidates in any of the races claims victory before there's a consensus
[58:25.800 --> 58:30.640]  result then we're going to add some informational context to that post
[58:30.640 --> 58:36.240]  directly saying that there's no consensus result yet. We see in the
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.280]  data that twice as many voters intend to cast a ballot by mail than have ever
[58:41.280 --> 58:47.840]  before. They are disproportionately Joe Biden supporters. We might have the
[58:47.840 --> 58:52.040]  results saying something on the evening of November 3rd that it will not say the
[58:52.040 --> 58:55.880]  evening of November 10th. My advice to Joe Biden in October campaign this
[58:55.880 --> 59:02.760]  obviously is do not concede under any circumstances because I believe the other
[59:02.760 --> 59:14.920]  side is going to cheat and sneak. The fact is whether he knows it yet or not
[59:14.920 --> 59:19.360]  he will be leaving just because he might not want to move out of the White
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.800]  House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a
[59:23.800 --> 59:28.480]  duly elected president of the United States but there is a process it has
[59:28.480 --> 59:32.040]  nothing to do with it that certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel
[59:32.040 --> 59:37.560]  like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the
[59:37.560 --> 59:42.920]  presidency it's not geography or location. This president is going to try to
[59:42.920 --> 59:47.120]  steal this election. This is the guy who said that all mail-in ballots are
[59:47.120 --> 59:51.760]  fraudulent. Have you ever considered what would happen if the election result
[59:51.760 --> 59:56.560]  came out as you being the winner and Trump refused to leave? Yes I have and I
[59:56.560 --> 1:00:01.520]  was so damn proud. Here you have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping
[1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:07.960]  the skin off of Trump and you have so many rank-and-file military personnel
[1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:13.280]  saying whoa we're not a military state this is not who we are. I promise you I'm
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:17.200]  absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House and with great
[1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:22.600]  dispatch. It has been suggested that this is a trial run for the president of the
[1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:30.040]  United States who may be organizing to not accept what happens when we have the
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:36.580]  election if he's not elected. Is he going to pull out his military? Is he going to
[1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:42.080]  engage us? He is already alluded to there may be a civil war if he's not
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:47.360]  re-elected. This is dangerous we are trying to find out more about it. And
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:52.240]  sadly the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:57.520]  Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It's really
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:02.960]  actually shameful enemies of the state. Without exaggeration President Trump's
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:07.120]  counterintelligence vulnerabilities are exponentially greater than any president
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:10.440]  in modern history. So do you think the president is a national security threat? I
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:14.080]  do. This administration this president has demonstrated that they have a
[1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:18.440]  capacity to go lower than we can even possibly imagine. So yeah I think we
[1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:23.400]  have to be concerned about that. His attempt to talk about mail and voting and
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:27.920]  all fraud that is associated with it is factually incorrect. He's just trying to
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:33.760]  set up a situation where he has the ability to delegitimize a vote. They
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.920]  created the mail and ballot crisis. They launched the COVID scam. They admitted
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:41.920]  they're going to contest it because they know they're losing. And I suggest you
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:45.400]  share the video it's at man.video that's only about half of it. Democrats
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:49.920]  confess to 2020 election theft or you just let them steal it. I'm telling you
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:54.200]  this is huge. Democrats confess to 2020 election theft. Stay with us. And
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:02:00.400]  perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his way the complications from
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:08.640]  COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be. It's estimated that 200
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:14.440]  million people have died. 200 million people have died. Probably by the time I
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:20.160]  finish this talk. Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:24.680]  America has died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 reality. He would
[1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:29.400]  want to say 6 million have lung scarring and heart damage. It's all made up. But
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:32.160]  you know where he got it? The mainstream media that continues to actually say
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:38.480]  things like that. They said that 4% of America would be dead already. Of course
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:42.520]  it's a point zero zero zero zero and then add a number because the numbers
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:48.600]  vary. It's a real virus just like people being struck by lightning is real. But to
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:54.840]  shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind-control.
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:06.760]  This is not satire. As we told you, home assistants will now be robots in your
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:11.680]  home and it will soon be law under COVID tracing other systems to have robots
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:15.400]  watching you in your home. Your iPhone is already a robot. Your droid is. Now
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.760]  they're announcing worldwide you'll have to have it to leave your home or have a
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:22.680]  job or fly on a plane or be on a bus. Now Amazon who backs Black Lives Matter and
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:42.680]  funded the cop killing around the country is now launching drones in your house.
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:04:03.440]  Welcome to the Alexa Ring home surveillance drone. The latest innovation in
[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:08.200]  home security. Now you're totally safe and a giant mega corporation is watching
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:12.560]  everything you do and selling data on you and your family. Welcome to the future.
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.800]  Oh never mind me. I'm just an autonomous drone. One of the most powerful and
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:22.800]  richest ruthless corporation in the world. Now you should watch what you say and
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:27.760]  remember I will report you to police and create databases. We sell the highest
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:33.800]  bidder. But if you criticize me, I'll have your social credit score lowered and
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:42.800]  may even have you permanently detained. So watch what you say.
[1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:51.360]  It's game time. We're 38 days out from the election. We're 117 out from the
[1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:58.320]  inauguration. That means after election day, 79 days of hell. But the deep state
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:03.000]  openly pushing to break up the country, kill the dollar, use race war as the
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:08.760]  cover to have leftist states under CHICOM Global's control secede. This is
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:14.160]  Hollywood owned by China making its move on America. They think we're gonna be
[1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:19.360]  hit flat footed by this. It's such a bold 21st century warfare move. But after
[1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:25.360]  we win this war, we will be able to understand these future attacks. They're
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:29.960]  gonna be coming in the technocracy system. But those that have launched these
[1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:34.720]  attacks need to be brought to justice and we have a plan to stop hitting the
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:39.520]  iceberg in 38 days to get Trump and the nation out front, exposing the fraudulent
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:43.400]  balance, exposing the criminal activity. And there have been arrests in Texas,
[1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:50.680]  Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, all these key states of Democrats in
[1:05:50.680 --> 1:05:57.840]  organized crime fraud, ballot harvesting when it's illegal, and signing up dead
[1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:01.640]  people and having them vote with the new mail-in ballots. It's all coming in. But
[1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:05.480]  if you try to even promote on Facebook that Ken Paxton, the state attorney
[1:06:05.480 --> 1:06:10.600]  general, indicted 138 people for just what Trump's talking about yesterday, it
[1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:17.000]  is all being shut down. Now, speaking of drones, ladies and gentlemen, it's not
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:22.160]  the technology and it's not the computers themselves inherently are bad. The
[1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:29.480]  question is, who is in control of that technology? Who is in your house? It's
[1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:32.720]  not you over a drone looking in your house. That's only part of it. It's big
[1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:38.000]  tech that's proven that they abuse your privacy and use that information against
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:43.440]  you. And people like Jeff Bezos call you an idiot for trusting him. Who else does?
[1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:49.680]  Zuckerberg said, people that trust me are dumb efforts. Yes, we're accepting
[1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:55.160]  Skynet and the AI system in. In the final terminator, you learn that it's a
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:06:59.200]  human brain that uploaded to the computer that's in control that tried to
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:06.440]  exterminate humanity. They're telling you what they're planning. They're in your
[1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:15.000]  face. And now Amazon is launching these drones in our house. And soon they'll say
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.800]  you've got to have them. Just like I told you years ago, they're gonna have apps on
[1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:22.640]  your phone making you be tracked for biological weapon releases. And they now
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:27.320]  admit indeed that's the case. So here's a drone that was a $5,000 just four years
[1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:32.520]  ago. Now a drone like this is about $300. And the cost of this is imploding down.
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:37.280]  And the reason this is bad is because it can be controlled by a big global
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:42.080]  corporation now merged with the National Security Agency. And the people
[1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:46.800]  that Bezos is working with are working on the anti-American team. That's what
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:51.840]  Bezos did not get the contracts with the Pentagon on the cloud. So we have to
[1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:55.560]  recognize they're trying to give rights to computers. They're trying to give
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:00.520]  rights to these GMO creatures they're creating so that we don't have rights.
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:08.360]  No. This drone does not have rights. It is not a sentient being. It is controlled
[1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:12.840]  by the globalist and it is a tool. So that I am not against technology, but I
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:17.720]  am against the technology that they have deployed and developed to replace us. We
[1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:22.000]  change our environment as humans. We conquer the elements. We conquer the
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.120]  wild. We're not conquered by other humans playing games and psychotics. And
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:29.480]  it's the sort of truth that is going to slice through the lies and our
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:34.560]  declaration that we are in charge of this planet, not the globalist and not
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:38.880]  their machines. So to Jeff Bezos and all the globalist technocrats and Tim Cook
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:42.200]  and their slave camps in China and all their evil they try to cover up with
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:45.760]  Black Lives Matter, Marxism and the cop killing, I say to you, your
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:54.080]  technocracy is dead on arrival. You understand that? We are in charge of
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:09:01.440]  the planet, not Soros and not Satan. Do you understand that Soros? You pathetic
[1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:07.840]  maggot. We are in charge, not you. Is that clear? Is that clear? You little maggot
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:12.640]  and your little maggot son. You understand that? You think you're gonna have
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:18.040]  this fight and have robots want it? No! We'll defeat you and your goddamn
[1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:22.960]  robots. You understand that? Damn you to hell, you Satanist. All right, well that
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:28.240]  was fun. Got a pretty good whack on that drone. Let's see how the old drone's
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:34.000]  doing. All right, I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna get deadly serious why I'm so
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:39.840]  concerned about their attack profile. Because we knew this was coming down. We
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:48.000]  knew what they were planning and now we're sure of it. They are so crazy that
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:53.280]  they are going to try to execute their operation even though we're aware of it
[1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:57.720]  but that's the key to the chicoms of the big bankers and the globalists. They
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:01.520]  don't care because they think they'll make it a Democrat Republican fight. Here
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:07.960]  is the bottom line. Here is the key. Here is the fulcrum. What do they do when it
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:11.480]  comes out that Bezos and Soros are fighting the riders? The media shuts it
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:20.280]  down. What do they do when that information unfolds? What do they do? They
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:25.080]  fight like the devil to not get to blame. You expose Goldman Sachs and Chase and
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:29.040]  all the rest of the globalists and you expose the Rothschilds and Rothschilders
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:34.400]  and Bill Gates. You expose Bezos and you expose Tim Cook and you expose them all
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:38.000]  that they're the authors of the Depression and the worldwide starvation
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.280]  and COVID-19 out of the lab and the election fraud ahead of time instead
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:46.800]  of letting them shape the battle space and say that oh it's all Trump's gonna do
[1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:54.600]  it when it's them doing it they will lose. But the Republican morons when the
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:59.120]  sycophantic media calls up they still think mainstream media has power. These
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:02.480]  old on average 80 year olds in Congress and I don't think it's old people but
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:05.880]  these old lawyers they think when they get a nice comment on CNN they're
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:13.040]  winning. They've come out and said oh guess what we don't like the fact Trump
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:16.080]  wants to steal the election and it's gonna contest it because the media goes
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:19.840]  Trump says he's contesting the election and stealing it. Do you support that? They
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:24.320]  go oh no I don't and they get a brownie point and their constituent reads that
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:30.080]  and knows they're an idiot. You need to go visit these old stupid ass lawyers and
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:34.440]  say America doesn't like fancy production. They don't like candy ass
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:38.480]  garbage and they don't like you getting brownie points with CNN. They want the
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.760]  truth you idiots. Big Tech doesn't respect you because you're stupid, you're
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:48.760]  ill-informed, you're dinosaurs. So get the hell out of the way or start leading.
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:56.320]  They are gonna scuttle the whole country and bring it down. Period! And we cannot
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:04.400]  sit here and let them do it. It's just that simple. The equation is simple. The
[1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:07.480]  math is simple. They're the ones that said they would contest because they're
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:10.840]  losing. They're the ones that engage in the fraud to hold it up. They're the ones
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:13.800]  that say they're gonna bring in all this martial law. They're the ones that say
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.680]  they don't want the dollar to do well. They're the ones that want to attack our
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:23.120]  families. They're the ones that tell us we suck. There are enemies declared and
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:27.840]  they can't believe they haven't been rejected. They've got their fifth string
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:33.640]  of zombies that can't even talk up there pissing down our backs and telling us
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:42.640]  it's rating. No, no, no, no. Do you understand globalists? No! You're not
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:47.160]  getting the Republic and not just the minions but the controllers are gonna
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:53.520]  pay! Do you understand globalists? Do you understand sorrows? You will pay! Introducing

[1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:06.000]  turmeric. It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.800]  that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:15.080]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:19.360]  also is then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:23.800]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrates and our first product
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:27.320]  got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months. Some of our
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:31.400]  staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better. For me, they're both
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:35.080]  amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:39.280]  the Info War. So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at

[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:00.360]  real power comes from experience and I've been in the fight more than 26 years
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:03.040]  against the globalist so it's important for listeners and viewers to
[1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:06.360]  understand. When you support Info Wars to keep us on the air, you're not
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.040]  supporting a news outlet that has sources and so we're able to always tell you
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:14.760]  what's coming when others can't. It's because we are studying the enemy and
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.840]  doing the original analysis that gets picked up by Trump intelligence
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:22.480]  agencies and major corporations that are part of the resistance, that are part
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:25.840]  of the resistance to the overarching globalist system. So I have to tell you
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:30.680]  how the hierarchy works. In many cases, Info Wars is at the head. We're not the
[1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:35.160]  tail. That means you're at the head and that's why your support of us is so
[1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:39.120]  critical. Biden and his constellation of criminals have told us and many others
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:42.440]  that if they get elected, they're not just gonna shut down Info Wars, they're
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:45.720]  gonna shut you down with a long depression, forced inoculations and more.
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:49.520]  So now more than ever, keep Info Wars on the air with high quality products at
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:52.520]  infowarstore.com.
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:15:03.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:37.280]  Let me just boil it down before these guests join us. Let's get reporters who
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:47.960]  are exposed. Bill Gates amongst the constellation of criminals, the axis of
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:54.480]  scum, having white people go out and stir up black people to turn Americans
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:16:03.080]  against each other. And they're so damn evil. Their manifesto says their main
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:07.520]  mission is to chop black men's balls off and end the family. So they finally,
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:13.080]  after five years, took it off their website or longer. I'm sorry, it's just
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:15.560]  like, oh, the good guys are here. What do they want? Oh, they would go to our
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:22.080]  families and chop our balls off. Okay, great, whatever. And man, I've been down
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:25.720]  with these events. You'll have some racist dumbass black person, dumbass
[1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:30.200]  anti-white white person walk over and start screaming Nazi at you. And you can't
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:36.080]  even get mad at them. I mean, they work for a real Nazi. George Soros said the
[1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:41.520]  best time of his life was rounding Jews up. I just started laughing like, what the
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:47.320]  hell is your frickin problem, man? I mean, I would take no pleasure in getting in a
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:52.600]  fight with one of those dumbasses. They're just idiots. They're robots. It's
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:58.040]  like jumping on people's cars, trying to pull them out of their cars. And then
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:02.560]  they drive off scared. And you go, they hit me, they hit me because Soros people
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:08.400]  ordered you to go down there and do that. This is the next level, man. This is the
[1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:15.840]  next level. This next level. So let me tell you what's going on. Let me break
[1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:21.560]  this down. All right. You're like, Alex, we've heard this 500 times, probably a
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:26.640]  thousand times from you. It's all you talk about. I know, because when they can
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:29.920]  test the election in 38 days, which they officially have set up and they're
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:32.720]  wargaming it and saying we're doing it no matter what, we know we're going to
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:37.040]  lose. And we're going to have states to see and try to kill the dollar. And they've
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:40.040]  got all the news saying the dollar is dying, which if that happens, we will be
[1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:46.280]  in a depression where we're starving to death. And I'm just like watching the
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:52.320]  Durham investigation that's three years old. Durham has a little beard and he
[1:17:52.320 --> 1:17:56.480]  sits there with his thumb in his butt. So he'll save us. It's just, it's all these
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:59.480]  lawyers that still think they're in America and are still worried about the
[1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:03.160]  two-party system and, oh, they've got dirt on us. So we got to not do it on
[1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:09.600]  them. America is about to end and a demon named George Soros is laughing
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:13.280]  about it. And if you think you've got problems going up against these people
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:18.760]  when you have a chance, it's so easy. I mean, you arrest like 10 of them. They
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:26.040]  all turn and run like a pack of cowards, but you won't do it. I mean, finally,
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:29.440]  Mitch McConnell has grown one hair on his testicles. And I'm not trying to talk
[1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:32.760]  like this is why I really am behind the scenes, okay? I mean, he's finally grown
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:38.960]  one little hair on his testicles. Maybe Bill Barr's got two. And I'm just
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:44.960]  sitting here watching all this go on. And I mean, this is certain doom. This is
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:50.280]  absolutely, will destroy the country probably. And we have to sit here and
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:54.520]  wait for it to happen. And there are those that go, well, we'll have the
[1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:58.600]  Supreme Court, we'll manage this and blah, blah, blah. No, you won't manage
[1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:05.160]  anything. You think, you know, you heard Caputo, who's a high level advisor to
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:08.680]  Trump, flip out a few weeks ago and then delete the video and audio, but we
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:12.680]  haven't reset. They've got hit teams. And he was just a cover. They've got
[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:16.000]  foreign mercenaries here, blah, blah, blah. You want to, and he flipped out
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:20.480]  because that's what they got, folks. Okay. And I'm not trying to scare you. I'm
[1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:24.240]  saying you better have your defensive weapons out. Remember when I got banned
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:31.680]  on Twitter and Jack Dorsey was on Lester Holt on NBC News. And he goes,
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:35.040]  Alex Jones last night said, go to Democrats homes and kill them with
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:38.760]  their battle rifles. He was, I know I saw it, but I'm not banning him yet. It was
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:41.440]  this weird, weird, weird thing like they were the holdout or whatever. It was
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:45.760]  all just sigh. And then I guess you're right. The banning is right. And
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:49.920]  notice they never showed a video. I said, Antifa is drilling for the 2020
[1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:54.520]  election. They're only a decoy to come to your house. Here's the groups that
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:59.480]  they funded. Here's the terror groups. Here's the mercenaries, MS 13, Chinese
[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:04.720]  intelligence, other groups. They're planning this. They plan to make their
[1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:08.720]  move and kill certain high value targets, a couple thousand people right
[1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:12.480]  after the elections being contested. And when Lester Holt, them are scared
[1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:16.640]  because they're like, how does Jones have all this? And they're like, we got
[1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:19.440]  to get him off air right now. And they put that out everywhere and media
[1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:22.680]  matters here because they're crapping their bridges and they've got, they've
[1:20:22.680 --> 1:20:27.240]  tapped into our phones or reading everything. Guys, I know how to watch
[1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:30.280]  what you're doing and I know what you're up to. I study warfare. That's what
[1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:34.320]  I've done my whole life. Can't help it. I know, I know what you're doing, dude. I
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:37.640]  don't need any secret documents. I know more than you do. And that's the thing
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:41.680]  is I've decompartmentalized even the schmucks in the system that serve the
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:45.360]  evil. And I'm not trying to brag about this. Most generals and people really
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:48.760]  don't read military strategy books. They don't really read propaganda books.
[1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:52.720]  They really don't read, you know, just large swaths of stuff like that. They
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:58.320]  act like they do. I do. That's what I've done. And I know there's forwards,
[1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:04.480]  backwards, upside down and around the clock here, okay? That's what I do. And I
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:08.040]  want to tell the globalists this because they know I know. I know all sorts of
[1:21:08.040 --> 1:21:12.120]  stuff, don't I? Don't I? And I've shown you. Oh, there'll be a mass shooting
[1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:15.960]  like probably tonight, 10 o'clock at a big music event somewhere, maybe a rock
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:22.560]  and roll concert, maybe a, yeah. That literally was just, that wasn't me. That
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:25.080]  was God. That stuff happens. I'll just start saying something. I'm like, what
[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:29.720]  the hell's this? And it's not made up. It's not me. It just happens. But most of
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:33.520]  this is already that I've studied so much stuff, my brains lined up with the
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:37.800]  facts and already has all the information and all the evidence. So then
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:43.240]  that Holy Spirit wave goes right into it and just it's picked up and gets it. So
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:46.400]  you guys with all your Satanism and your voodoo rituals and your devil worship
[1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:49.560]  and your Aleister Crowley crap that you're getting power and all this other
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:53.200]  stuff, you have no idea what, what, what this is really all about. You're
[1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:58.960]  pathetic, you're worms. And so only reason I tell you all this here, close to
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:02.640]  this, I'm talking to the enemy right now, is you're going to lose no matter what
[1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:07.680]  you pull or what you do. And your God is a joke and is not a God and is a fraud
[1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:14.280]  and you are a fraud and you're over and you're done. You're done. You understand
[1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:18.680]  that? I don't say that for you that are really turned over to your slaves, but
[1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:22.760]  for your family and your minions, everybody around you, you're all going
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:28.240]  to pay. You think you're going to threaten us and that scares us. You want
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:31.800]  to be scared. You want to be real scared. Got to be real scared of who you
[1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:37.640]  follow. I'm scared of me. So we'll talk more about this with the guests that
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:41.880]  are coming up and they've got the big articles out on who's really fun and
[1:22:41.880 --> 1:22:45.640]  anti fun the rest of it and everybody playing dumb. And of course, Rand Paul
[1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:49.080]  knows who's doing it. Of course, Trump knows they're like, Gee, wonder who's
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:55.320]  doing it. They better stop. They're not going to stop. And the reason they
[1:22:55.320 --> 1:22:58.600]  don't is because Soros helped overthrow a bunch of other countries for Ronald
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:04.000]  Reagan. So because of Ronald Reagan and HW Bush, we won't burn him because he
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.800]  worked high level CIA and State Department. So what? That's all. Bring it
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:14.920]  all out. Burn him. Burn him now. Burn him politically. Burn him down. I want
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:20.760]  him destroyed. Or you just sit here and you keep bringing in the attacks and
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:24.080]  letting them attack us and letting them piss all over everything and letting
[1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:26.960]  them child molest and all their crap because all of you were scared of
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:30.600]  George Soros. I'm not scared of George Soros. My God, I'm scared of even
[1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:36.000]  being in his service in any way. Looking at that swollen demonic pustule.
[1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:38.840]  It's us or them.
[1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:45.960]  They're openly going to steal the election and create civil war. And the
[1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:49.760]  executive branch needs to grow some hair on their chest and do something
[1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:54.880]  because if you're a bunch of cowards, remember the global lock down for
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:59.680]  witnessing the black lives matter. Antifa riots and racial attacks were all
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:05.680]  seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires led by
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:11.520]  people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and others. They set
[1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:16.000]  up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.720]  that are hundreds of billions of dollars individually, leveraging that
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:23.600]  against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:28.000]  government and police. And the mayors are again, they're playing their
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.960]  political game, try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:35.880]  and Western Europe show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:39.480]  for billions on the dollar. That's why I'm so angry that these globalists,
[1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:41.760]  because when you're looking at them, they're the ones that sit in their
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:46.800]  councils and have decided to run these plans against us. They are enemies of
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:50.560]  humanity and must be dealt with. It's us or them, period.
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:57.280]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fatchy. Doesn't matter if I'm invested with Bill Gates,
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:01.520]  in many of the same vaccines I push on you. It's the same thing with the
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:06.480]  health ministers in the UK and Europe. They're all invested as well, but the
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:11.840]  governments have decided it's not a conflict of interest. Also, the media is
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:17.400]  going to call me a genius when the second wave I've been warning of comes in the
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:22.640]  fall and winter because we're gonna count all the flu and all the pneumonia and
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:30.200]  cold death of old people again. And the lockdown will never end. That's why we're
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:34.480]  saying the vaccine will take several years, but don't worry, it'll come out.
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:40.240]  I'll make a bunch of money, you'll get sick, but that's okay. Because I ran the
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:46.360]  Wuhan lab and it's all public, but I don't get in trouble. If you talk bad about me,
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:51.360]  we use big tech to get you out of there.
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:58.360]  The Renaissance, the Great Enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:06.840]  scientific tyranny. That's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:12.680]  technocrats are above the law. The public isn't even considered to be as valuable
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:17.520]  as a cow. In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:23.120]  removed. That is the post-human extremist plan. That is the public
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:28.400]  ideology of the globalists and everything they've built with this high-tech grid is
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:35.440]  to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed. And any future
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:39.560]  generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:46.200]  mere shadow of what humans once were. This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:53.160]  mass vandalism against God's creation. Humanity, this is the essence of evil.
[1:26:53.160 --> 1:27:12.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:36.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:45.640]  All right. You noticed last week, Newt Genrich simply pointed out that openly,
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:50.600]  publicly, George Soros has given hundreds and hundreds of millions of
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:28:01.120]  dollars just this year alone to Black Lives Matter. Now, on top of that, we know
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:05.680]  that Jeff Bezos funds it. We know that Tim Cook funds it. They've made
[1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:11.560]  announcements. But when you criticize it in a negative way, you then get censored.
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:14.960]  They told Newt Genrich, you can't do that. It became a big controversy.
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:18.320]  They cut the mic off. They had to wait and see what to do. We know judicial
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:21.440]  watch cut and trouble for talking about George Soros paying for $1,000 ID
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:26.360]  cards, credit cards to get people into the United States, to help make a
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:31.320]  migrant treks up. So just like they call protesters, protesters when they're
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:36.240]  killing people, these aren't migrants. These are invaders, many of them. Trained
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:40.000]  by the United Nations, part of a larger replacement migration plan, not wanting
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.880]  to come be Americans wanting to overthrow America. That's the UN's goal, not
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:48.080]  saying all of them are like that. Here's some of the headlines. Jeff Bezos,
[1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:53.600]  happy to lose customers over Black Lives Matter message. How China and Jeff
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:57.160]  Bezos benefit from BLM and protests, businesses burned and monuments
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:01.120]  destroyed. All the stores closed with a COVID-19 lockdown. He doubles his
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:06.240]  money. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explains his company's BLM support in response to
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:09.720]  customer complaints. He says, leave, I don't care about you. They donate $10
[1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:12.680]  million to Black Lives Matter. Amazon's new security drone flies around
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:19.360]  inside your house. Now he hired the former head of the NSA. So that's what
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:24.640]  they're doing. Well, there's a new article out. That's it. NationalFile.com broke
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:29.480]  last night. Got a lot of attention. It's also at infowars.com. We can put that up
[1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:36.280]  on screen for folks. And it deals with Bill Gates connected to, well, I mean,
[1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:40.680]  of course he's connected to. He funds all these big groups. He's a front man.
[1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:45.920]  He's tax exempt. He's made $200 billion since he went tax exempt. Nobody else
[1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:51.560]  is allowed to do that. And if we can, can we put that headline back up on
[1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:56.760]  screen for me, guys? Thanks. Bale project tied to Antifa, U-Haul, received
[1:29:56.760 --> 1:30:03.040]  millions from Bill Gates, UMG, Jack Dorsey, among others. So everybody shocked
[1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:07.360]  by this. It's a fact. So I'm glad you guys dug into this particular group.
[1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:12.000]  There's so many others. And we're joined here by Jack Hatfield, investigative
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:18.480]  journalist with NationalFile. And at Jack Hatter's on Twitter is how you
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:21.800]  follow him. And of course, Tom Pappert in per Pappertine needs to
[1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:27.040]  do an introduction. Guys, thanks for having us. Tom, you're the expert on this
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:31.840]  in this particular article. Bring us in and introduce us to Jack Hatfield.
[1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:36.200]  Well, so we started following this in the moments after that famous video now,
[1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:40.760]  Alex, of the U-Haul truck delivering shields, bottles of water, masks,
[1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:45.360]  umbrellas, all kinds of rioting supplies. And it just was such an anomaly.
[1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:49.800]  You know, why is there a U-Haul in the middle of a soon to be riot that we now
[1:30:49.800 --> 1:30:54.320]  know led to two cops getting shot? Well, it turns out there was a woman
[1:30:54.320 --> 1:30:58.440]  involved who rented this U-Haul. We now know who she is. We now know her
[1:30:58.440 --> 1:31:03.320]  background. She is employed by the Bail Project, which is a globalist
[1:31:03.320 --> 1:31:09.400]  initiative to do away with the concept of bail period in Western civilization.
[1:31:09.400 --> 1:31:14.280]  She's called a bail disruptor for these people. And she also runs her own
[1:31:14.280 --> 1:31:17.760]  little social justice causes. And she was at Charlottesville in 2017.
[1:31:17.760 --> 1:31:21.640]  So she has quite a history. Then you look into the bail project.
[1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:25.080]  You know, how is this woman paying her bills? I know if I was going to pay
[1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:29.280]  for a U-Haul, I would have to do it with the money I make here at my job.
[1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:34.040]  The bail project has ties to Soros. It is funded by Jack Dorsey.
[1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:38.320]  Bill Gates has done fundraising initiatives. And Jack Hatfield, I just
[1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:41.000]  have to say you've done a fantastic job putting this together.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:47.520]  Maybe you can break down how this sticky web is tangled together.
[1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:53.320]  Yes, well, there was a, we found from this, from the Twitter account
[1:31:53.320 --> 1:31:57.960]  IntelWave, Intel.Wav, and the guys with the Third World Fight Club,
[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:03.120]  who are this group of concerned citizens who first tracked down Zola.
[1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:08.040]  And then a number of these fundings then came from them.
[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:12.480]  And then we were able to dig then even deeper. So the first thing we found
[1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:18.720]  was that Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, helped donate $11 million to
[1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:25.040]  organizations that included the bail project. Him, along with an organization
[1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:30.400]  started by Rihanna, which is the Clara Lionel Foundation, donated $11
[1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:34.840]  million to these organizations to advance racial equality with the focus
[1:32:34.840 --> 1:32:39.600]  on criminal justice and policing reform. So that was the first sign
[1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:45.520]  of real proper funding that we got. Then after that, next, it turns out
[1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:52.280]  that not only was it Jack Dorsey, but it was actually you, the citizens,
[1:32:52.280 --> 1:32:56.800]  the American citizens who had been funding it with up to $1 million in
[1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:00.680]  federal coronavirus relief funds. These funds were supposed to go the
[1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:04.360]  hardworking Americans and small businesses to keep them going through
[1:33:04.360 --> 1:33:09.000]  this pandemic. But no, between $350,000 and $1 million in these
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:13.680]  federal relief funds went to the bail project. And then after that, the big
[1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:17.480]  kicker. This was the one that really started then getting attention.
[1:33:17.480 --> 1:33:21.520]  There was some more digging done into the direct funding of this organization.
[1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:24.640]  And we found there was something called the Audacious Project, which was
[1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:29.160]  something that was linked together with various funding sources, including
[1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:34.720]  the TED organization, aka the guy behind TED Talks, and the Bill Gates
[1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:41.480]  Foundation donated around $406 million to various organizations. And in fact,
[1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:47.840]  it's been donating up to $50 million a year just to the bail project up to
[1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:51.880]  $50 million. You know, where is why do they need all this money? Where is
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:56.080]  this money going? Well, we can see now because it's funding these
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:59.640]  antifer rioters on the street. That's right. It's just like darkness and
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:02.800]  horse manure produces mushrooms. They're producing dead cops and burning
[1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:11.720]  settings. Yes, exactly. Well, and of course, now we're seeing more of this
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:15.240]  come out. I mean, it's obviously, Alex, you brought up a good point in that we
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:18.600]  knew this. We know that they work together. We know that it's concerted. We
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:22.160]  know that this doesn't happen in a vacuum. But never before have they
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:27.160]  accidentally tipped their hat like this, where because one woman made the
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:32.040]  perhaps foolish decision and against her hierarchy, her betters to go out and
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:35.880]  rent this U-Haul and do it so publicly in the middle of broad daylight with
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:40.280]  cameras rolling. Now we're able to cut the intermediate out. We actually got a
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:45.520]  kernel at the grassroots instead of instead of just a private. Exactly.
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:49.280]  Exactly. And so now we can see exactly where the money is coming from, how
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:54.000]  they organize. So for and it's the same as you said, Alex, this is not just a
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.600]  foot soldier. So this woman was on the ground in Charlottesville in 2017. She
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:03.400]  was reported in the media as a victim with a broken leg from the horrible, as
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:07.160]  Joe Biden says, white supremacist KKK attack, where they come out of the trees
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:12.160]  holding Tiki torches. Obviously, there's no video of this. There is video of her.
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:15.840]  There's audio of her admitting that she was the one who rented the U-Haul, but
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:18.600]  denying it was used to break the law. There is.
[1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:22.440]  Even though we have the video, so listen, guys, by the way, I want to be
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:25.000]  clear, because once I said it, it sounded like I was taking away from your
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:28.960]  groundbreaking deep research that you and Mr. Hatfield came out with. No, no,
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:33.880]  no. I just meant people get punished for talking about it on the news. Tucker
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:36.960]  Carlson, they've just announced is being censored. Facebook's going to throttle
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:40.640]  their page back. So they're going to, it's called throttling it. Now, Shadowban
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:44.680]  didn't exist, but now they have a new term for it. Facebook throttles official
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:49.120]  Tucker Carlson page with reduced distribution 40 days before election.
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:53.360]  It's all here. That's a national file article. It's all happening, but that's
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:58.400]  new. And I meant to mention that the fact that they got COVID money and the
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:02.040]  fact that all these other conservative or normal people with real businesses,
[1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:08.120]  farms, auto parts stores, little factories, restaurants, I know family can't
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.000]  get any of the money in the last eight months, but all the big people like
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:18.680]  Bezos, $33 billion. So I salute you both. Stay with us for several more segments,
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:21.600]  gentlemen, because I want to give you guys the floor and go through all this
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:25.200]  list of listeners. This is one of those things that can bring the globalist
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:31.120]  down. You have the most rich billionaires in the world that want through
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:35.840]  intermediaries to fund this COVID to shut down the economy. Black lives matter
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:38.360]  to be the cover for martial law. And they're saying they're going to contest
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:42.640]  the election. And you've still got Congress going. Gee, I wonder if they're
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:46.960]  organized. Give me a break, Congress. You know who it is. It's the deep state.
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:51.720]  It's the sports of 100 people. They want more. Give it to them. We've now entered
[1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:55.200]  month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:59.720]  killing millions of people via starvation. But the good news is it's caused a
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:05.640]  planetary awakening as well. The general public all over the planet hate Bill
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:10.360]  Gates. He's the most unpopular person on earth. People know he's not a doctor.
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:14.920]  People know he's a eugenicist. The population knows that his vaccines that
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:18.400]  he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses, polio,
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:23.520]  steroids and more. It's even the associated press. So now they're beginning
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:27.680]  to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:32.200]  government and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:36.720]  to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing.
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:41.800]  So remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:46.600]  done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization. They are
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:52.360]  the enemies of humanity. They want you dead. Last week, Tucker Carlson came out
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.880]  and said America is becoming the Soviet Union. In many ways, we're worse than
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:00.600]  the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:04.800]  surveilling and censoring us. And we're gonna get a lot worse than the Soviet
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:08.120]  Union when it comes to force inoculations and the medical tyranny
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:12.160]  being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what you can and
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:16.200]  can't say online. The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting for
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:20.960]  its life. And the enemy's number one mission is to get Trump out of office
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:25.160]  and number two is to silence info wars because we understand just how
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:30.200]  diabolical they are, just how evil they are and we won't miss words. We know
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:32.920]  who the global star. We've got their number and we know how to beat them
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:37.640]  and we cover it seven days a week live at info wars and it's only because of
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:41.320]  your support. So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us and take advantage
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:45.280]  of the sales and get great products at infowarstore.com now. The globalists
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:47.640]  are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:56.520]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life? Are you sleeping too well
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:58.680]  at night? Is your city too safe?
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:07.080]  Well, not anymore. Introducing Democrats. Politicians so incompetent they'll
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:12.680]  fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence and even
[1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:17.720]  homelessness. The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:23.840]  stupidity. No more pesky law and order. When Democrats are in charge, nobody's
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:29.360]  safe. Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:34.560]  the ground. But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling black
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:41.680]  out, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing
[1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:43.640]  chaos right to your front door.
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:56.200]  The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally. They've
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:01.280]  aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually. We are
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:06.680]  living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:10.640]  destiny of our species. So that's why big tech control with the very dark
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:15.680]  forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:19.920]  depressed, make us alone and traffic control every aspect of our lives,
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:23.800]  literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:28.280]  they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:33.160]  true Christmome and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. They are trying to
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.760]  create a new dark age where they have all the high technology and life
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:41.480]  extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:47.160]  carbon credits and through a social credit score. This is their plan. We must
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:51.320]  come together and awaken out of our trance and say no, we must embrace God.
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:57.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:42.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and Tom Pappard is our guest who
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:46.320]  loves other great writers Jack Patfield. So guys, continue getting into this.
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:50.760]  This is really big that we always hear about Soros and Gates funding these
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:54.120]  things and they admittedly make big donations, but they then do it
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.400]  particularly through subgroups right to the Anarchists, right to the BLM
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:41:58.840]  people.
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:07.280]  Yes, exactly. This is something that I, oh, go ahead, Jack. So this is
[1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:11.520]  something that I actually got a lot of people in in my mentions on Twitter
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:15.160]  last night, complaining when I pointed out that Bill Gates gave funding
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:18.720]  this people, you know, they were saying that, oh, you know, Bill Gates is a
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:22.640]  billionaire of, you know, he doesn't have time to, you know, rent a $19
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:25.680]  U-Haul. Well, of course, he doesn't. Of course, he doesn't do that. You know,
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:29.800]  if we funds the organization, he funds, then money comes from his
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:34.560]  foundation to then various organizations and then they go down the
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:37.560]  then they go down the way. You know, George Soros and Bill Gates are not,
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:41.440]  you know, the CEO of Antifa sitting on some big leather chair and dictating
[1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:44.920]  exactly what happens. You know, it's the rich and powerful give their money to
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:48.200]  these groups and knowing full well what they get up to. You know, it's not
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:51.760]  that, you know, of course, like most anti-ariders aren't paid. You know,
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:55.360]  that's ridiculous. It's mostly just thugs wanting to go and search and
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:59.000]  smash things up. But, you know, but you have people like Zola who are the
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.560]  professional agitators. You know, it's said in her bio that she had had been a
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:06.680]  professional organizer, which is, you know, somebody who goes around and is
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:11.480]  paid to start trouble at these protests. Of course, anyone who rent a U-Haul
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.480]  for dirt cheap, but nobody has the time for that. You know, the real
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:19.280]  importance of this funding is that they can, people like Zola can pay their rent
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:23.480]  and their food bills and they don't have to do a nine to five job. That means
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:27.160]  they have all this free time to go and, to go and rent the U-Haul, to go and
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:30.880]  spend their time going across the country, flying wherever and organizing
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:34.400]  these protests. That's the importance of the money. And that's, that's why this
[1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:37.960]  funding makes a significant, serious, significant difference. Because if they
[1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:41.000]  didn't have the funding, the people who are doing the organizing and the
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.280]  agitating simply couldn't get it. And a lot of the left just refused to admit
[1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:46.280]  that.
[1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:50.560]  Well, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry. I keep interrupting you guys. I should
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:52.560]  say who we're going to next. Tom, go ahead.
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:56.160]  Well, I was just going to say that, I mean, these people obviously know what
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:00.240]  they're buying with their money. I mean, it's on this woman, this Zola
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:05.480]  ladies bio on the Project Bail website or the Bail Project website that she is
[1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:09.480]  an anti-fascist activist. In other words, that she is a member of Antifa. She is
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:14.400]  listed with her photo, a very flattering photo of the woman on the website. And
[1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:19.000]  then she's there with U-Hauls and shields and water bottles and possibly
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:23.760]  weapons. We don't exactly know what was in that U-Haul. So this creates a layer
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:27.080]  of cover for the people, for the funding class, for the Bill Gates and the
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:31.640]  Soros of the world. So the fact checkers can come out and accuse us of
[1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:35.360]  anti-semitism and of fake news and everything else. Because no, there was
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:40.520]  an intermediary. Bill Gates didn't hand Mrs. Auler the $20 to rent a U-Haul. It
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:43.960]  went through this other organization that is completely funded by these
[1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:48.040]  globalist sources. And that's of course what has happened within seconds we
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:51.560]  started getting, I mean, within instantly and this is how you know you're over the
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:54.720]  target and I've learned this from you, Alex. Instantly we started getting the
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:58.760]  accusations as soon as we mentioned Soros name of anti-semitism. As soon as we
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:03.840]  put up Bill Gates within seconds, it was accusations of anti-COVID conspiracy
[1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:08.400]  theories and all of this nonsense. And of course now politifact the the the
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:12.560]  mouthpiece of the left when it comes to fact checking really is coming out on
[1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:16.320]  Facebook and saying if you dare to connect Bill Gates and Microsoft then you
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:20.800]  are fake news undermining the election. So this obviously like you said Alex,
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:24.440]  they did not want this woman to be discovered. I think they're in panic
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:28.320]  mode right now trying to figure out how to cover it up. That's right because the
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:30.640]  last thing I was gonna say at the start of the show and I'm glad you mentioned
[1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:35.600]  this where you made me think of this. The last thing they want is a tweet getting
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:39.880]  to Trump or getting to Don Jr. That's really who's getting him most of stuff
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:43.120]  and I'm not giving up sources. The enemy's known that for a while. It's Don
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:46.840]  Jr. folks. The country probably be over. It wasn't for Don Jr. at this point. He's
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:50.560]  one of the only people that can still get stuff to Trump. And so flood Don Jr.
[1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:55.680]  folks flood Don Jr. with a national file article because it's a fact. You know
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:58.840]  it's like Joe Rogan. They got him to apologize when they've now arrested over
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:06.320]  150 arsonists in Oregon and over 100 in Seattle. Not in the fires in the cities.
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:10.520]  Outside doing it. Lighting things on fire. And it turns out they're BLM. They're
[1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:16.520]  Antifa. Some have been arrested at BLM Antifa deals. But with fact checking, you'll
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.920]  pull it a fact. And in the Southern Prairie Law Center, they say that none of
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:27.720]  that is Antifa. And so Joe apologized and said oh I'm sorry I got duped that the
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:31.600]  fires were Antifa. We're not saying all the fires are them. But my God, they're
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:35.280]  burning down police stations. They're running what they said. If you don't
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:39.480]  elect who we want, we'll burn the country down. Oh, absolutely. They were saying
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:42.520]  that on the streets of Louisville the other night. They were specifically saying
[1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:46.000]  we didn't get what we want. So we're going to burn the MF for down. I mean,
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:50.920]  that is the play that yesterday. We just chew that up. You can Louisville. That's
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:54.840]  the headline. Louisville pro they're not protesters. They're terrorists. When you
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:59.080]  say I'm going to burn you down or kill you, if you don't. But is it that that's
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:02.840]  the good news that Rand Paul senator came out and said these are terrorist? Let's
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:07.520]  get to Hadfield's take on that. Yeah, well, exactly. You know, these people are
[1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:13.480]  domestic terrorists. You know, they have a such a disdain for police and law
[1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:18.360]  enforcement. And as you said, Rand mentioned this when he was attacked
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:22.360]  outside the Capitol. He said these people are funded. You know, these people are
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:26.920]  coming out of state. They're not local people. In fact, I mentioned a little bit
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:32.440]  of this yesterday when I was on war room with Owen. And I said there's been so
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:36.920]  many people who are coming from all over. I believe we saw this at Kenosha. You
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:40.520]  know, most of the people who arrested there came from out of state. But of
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:44.560]  course, you know, these same people who support anti for will attack Carl
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:49.080]  Rittenhouse for driving 30 minutes over a state border. But they'll support all
[1:47:49.080 --> 1:47:53.320]  these people coming from all across the country. In fact, I saw somebody who was
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:57.880]  claiming to act as one of these anti for medics. Okay, they'll go around and you
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:01.680]  know, if there's a if there's a tiny little wound, they'll they'll they'll wrap
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:03.960]  a bandage around it. And eventually that person will have to get their arm.
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:08.600]  Exactly. Here's the deal provide medical attention. Exactly. Hitler was a bad
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:13.520]  guy. But at least we knew who was attacking us with Soros and Bezos and
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:17.200]  all them. They'll brag and go, Oh, I'm funding Black Lives Matter. I'm funding
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:20.680]  anti for when we go, Okay, your people just did this. They go, We have nothing
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:25.240]  to do with that. You you anti semi, but whatever that has to do with it. I think
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:30.360]  Bezos is Jewish. I mean, this is crazy town where they're openly on one side
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:34.480]  going, we're funding this. We're proud of ourselves. You know, if you want to boycott
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:38.720]  Amazon, go ahead. We're proud of the fact we fund Black Lives Matter. Okay, well,
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:41.800]  you just funded more copkilling. Well, we have nothing to do with that. You crazy
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:43.520]  people. How did they try to do that?
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:48.480]  Well, Alex, I mean, they're using elements of the deep state that are still
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:51.720]  within the government to do it. I mean, they're they're citing a Department of
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:56.200]  Homeland Security report that says something like 96% of Black Lives
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:00.680]  Matter protests have been peaceful. And also that the biggest terrorist threat
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:04.720]  in the United States is posed by white supremacist and it will be white
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:10.160]  supremacist through 2021. So I mean, these they're they're working in concert
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:13.600]  with the government to create a propaganda for the campaign, right? Sorry,
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:17.760]  interrupt. And the FBI director, they snuck it on Trump. He says there's no
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:20.680]  election fraud, even though there's arrest all over the country of people
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:25.640]  engaged in illegal, ballot harvesting and fake dead people voting.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:30.720]  And of course, that Antifa is not a group. It's an ideology. I mean, these
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:34.640]  people are absolutely running a PR campaign for the violent, radical,
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:39.000]  leftist civil war reenactors for lack of a better word on the street, burning
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:42.800]  down our cities. You know, that's a good term. The left is trying to reenact
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:44.000]  the civil war. It's crazy.
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:49.400]  Well, and that it gives them the cover that these that Soros then needs to
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:53.600]  say, Well, I'm not funding the riots. I'm funding the social justice and the
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:58.600]  society. Notice the Democrats that lost the last civil war. They're now doing
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:00.960]  it racially. But this time they claim they're with the blacks. It's
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:02.720]  ridiculous. It's so obvious.
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:08.960]  Well, absolutely. Go ahead, Jack. Oh, in fact, we had something on the
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:12.160]  political fact article, which came out last night, or yesterday, I believe
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:15.960]  there was an update and included a quote from the Open Society Foundation,
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:20.320]  and he said, we have all violence of any kind. We do not now nor have we ever
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:25.000]  funded Antifa. Well, they may not have funded Antifa specifically, but they
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:29.920]  funded organizations who support people who employ people who maybe go out in
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.440]  their spare time and do Antifa. Or, you know, that's how it works. They give it
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:37.960]  to the big group. Exactly. Jack, they give it to the big group, and then they
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:40.600]  give it to the subgroup. Let's do a few more minutes on the other side of you
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:44.200]  guys can. Wow, such important work over at actualfall.com. Just briefly at the

[1:51:26.440 --> 1:51:29.920]  They may have some other specials in the future, but it's very rare for them.

[1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:41.280]  Let's not let them succeed
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:43.720]  The answer
[1:52:43.720 --> 1:52:50.720]  In 1884 is 1776.
[1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:59.720]  Infowars has been banned.

[1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:29.720]  The fight.
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:40.720]  Infowars.com
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:47.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:57.720]  I got off the river boat in New Orleans in the spring of 82.
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:00.720]  I walked into a gambling house.
[1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:05.720]  You know, listening to this makes me want to hear some rawhide for the Rowdy Yates.
[1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:11.720]  Man, I've been watching that on my television. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid.
[1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:17.720]  My mom had a big crush when she was little. She was like seven or eight years old.
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:23.720]  You watch a good wholesome show like that and you think about the TV today. It's just disgusting.
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:29.720]  You know what I watch? I watch Andy Griffith's show.
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:35.720]  But I was watching one the other day and I'm going to get this loaded off my phone because I shot video of it.
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:40.720]  They had a pro-forced inoculation piece. So even back then there was propaganda.
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:44.720]  I'm going to air that in a few days. The little shots of the show I cut.
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:47.720]  Guys, this is a short segment long segment coming up. Do two more with you.
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:50.720]  Sorry, I think some of your skype slays. We've been talking over each other, but it's been very powerful.
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:59.720]  I cannot describe to both of you men how big this is that Black Lives Matter and anti-reclaims are these organic, pro-American, anti-racist groups.
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:06.720]  And the progenitor, the guy that captains it's Alexander Soros on record through the subgroups.
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:11.720]  And so you guys have gone out in ferrity that they're getting, you know, other money and stimulus money.
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:19.720]  I mean, this is huge. And if Trump talks about it, instead of just all the audience knowing about it, you knowing about it, it's going to be massive.
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:27.720]  I think Trump needs to take the bull by the horns and identify the leftist billionaires that are captaining the attempt to have a civil war in this country,
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:34.720]  which the Washington Times even admits. Bezos, when the economy shuts down, everything's closed, he benefits when we're locked up during martial law.
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:41.720]  He takes over the economy. I mean, you talk about evidence, you talk about racketeering. Which one of you guys wants to go first on that?
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:48.720]  Well, I'll hop in. I mean, I think you hit the nose on the head, Alex. I mean, that's exactly what we're seeing here.
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:56.720]  You have Amazon getting richer than ever even seen possible. I mean, we're talking in terms of valuation, billions of dollars in a day type of material during COVID.
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:02.720]  And then the BLM riots, they figured out they can't get these lockdowns anymore. People won't put up with it.
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:07.720]  So what's the next best thing? Well, let's just have rioters out in the street so you can't go to the store.
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:12.720]  You're afraid to go to the store. You just order something on Amazon and hope it doesn't get looted on the way to your house.
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:18.720]  I think that that's an amazing insight. But I think you're also correct in that this has the potential.
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:26.720]  I feel like this could be a sea change moment because never before have we seen so clearly how the mechanisms work.
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:32.720]  We've always known it. You laid this out, which is probably why Jack and I knew to look at this stuff. Alex, you laid this out years ago.
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.720]  The guys at the top are smart. They have lawyers. They're not going to get caught in a stupid maneuver.
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:45.720]  But the people below them might. So this is, I believe, the first time we have a connection where we have the woman on the ground,
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:52.720]  how she is related to the bail project, how the bail project has had ties to George Soros, has been funded by Bill Gates,
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:57:00.720]  has been funded by these other people. And this has the potential, especially with the fact that these people got COVID funds,
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:08.720]  while small businesses all across this country are going out of business, while small businesses around this country are being looted out of business
[1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:14.720]  and rioted out of business, this bail fund that seeks to enable that gets money. I think you're absolutely right.
[1:57:15.720 --> 1:57:20.720]  President Trump should hear about this. And frankly, I'm like you, Alex, I don't care. Jack may disagree.
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:26.720]  Somebody can steal it from our website, put it on Fox News, get it to the president. Let's get this under control.
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:33.720]  Absolutely. Because they're scared. Look at the Gennrich thing. Soros brags he's funding Black Lives Matter.
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:40.720]  We got a minute to break, but Jack, if I just get a journalist, getting back to you. I think you guys have got the Death Star plans here.
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:47.720]  I think this is the key. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, as Tom said, we've known about this for ages, but now we have this link.
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:55.720]  But, you know, they're denying it. The, you know, the bail project said that Holly rented the truck in a personal capacity during a time off and did not use funds from bail projects.
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:58:02.720]  But that's like when a mafia don tells a capo, get rid of somebody and he tells a manager who tells a soldier, kill somebody. The don's still guilty.
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:06.720]  She works for them. It's all pre-packaged BS.
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:10.720]  Let's see what we find out real quick. Sorry, I'm ranting.
[1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:19.720]  No, exactly. I've been watching the Sopranos recently. Again, fantastic show. And Tony Soprano, he never gives an order by himself.
[1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:25.720]  He passed it down the chain of command. And of course, the next layer up will deny it. Obviously.
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:31.720]  This statement is less than worthless. That's what it is.
[1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:36.720]  Let's recap that. Come back to you, Jack. Stay there, Jack. This is amazing. You guys are knocking out of the park.
[1:58:36.720 --> 1:58:40.720]  People can follow Jack Hadfield's work at Jack Hatters on Twitter.
[1:58:48.720 --> 1:58:53.720]  In the area during a pandemic, we looked to local health authorities.
[1:58:54.720 --> 1:59:03.720]  So for example, in the U.S., it would be CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation in a narrow way, which could cause harm in the real world.
[1:59:03.720 --> 1:59:08.720]  That was a few months ago, and the CEO of Google, Sundar Pachai, made a very important statement.
[1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:12.720]  All the other big tech heads made the exact same statement, because it comes out of the U.N.
[1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:17.720]  That they follow the guidance of the WHO and or local government.
[1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:24.720]  What they mean is, in the United States, other world cities that have been unionized, or that have actually signed on to U.N. memorandums and agreements.
[1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:31.720]  So what he's saying is, oh, we follow the United Nations and our global government, and then we've got little stakeholder parents.
[1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:34.720]  That's how the U.N. works, that then give the illusion of it being local.
[1:59:35.720 --> 1:59:43.720]  But then when your doctors or your scientists or virologists come out and say that COVID-19 has massively exaggerated the power grab, they get silenced.
[1:59:43.720 --> 2:00:01.720]  Their press conferences get muzzled, just like they do in Communist China. That's what's really going on here.
[2:00:13.720 --> 2:00:17.720]  Keep them doggies rolling raw.
[2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:25.720]  Rain and wind and weather, hell and feather, wishing my gal was by my side.
[2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:27.720]  Hit them up, move them out.
[2:00:28.720 --> 2:00:34.720]  All the things I'm missing, good people's love and kissing, are waiting at the end of my ride.
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:36.720]  So hit them up, move them out.
[2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:40.720]  Move them on, hit them up, hit them up, move them on, move them on, hit them up, roll high.
[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:45.720]  Yeah, the globalists think they're hurting us, but this is a stampede I'm causing.
[2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:47.720]  It's going to go right over the top of their heads.
[2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:52.720]  Tom Papert and his investigative journalist Jack Hadfield broke some major news.
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:01:00.720]  They're the ones that broke all this, directly connecting this operative with the U-Haul with all the pre-made signs, you know, attack the cops, defund, kill everybody.
[2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:07.720]  And she's been tied to so many of the other ops, so many of the other smoke screens, so many other of the theater events.
[2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:12.720]  And that's why they, you know, sued us in the whole Charlottesville situation.
[2:01:13.720 --> 2:01:17.720]  I didn't say that the guy that worked for Hillary at the State Department killed the woman.
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:21.720]  I said they had their white supremacist, many of them paid, working for the deep state.
[2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:23.720]  It's all been confirmed.
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:25.720]  Of course, that's been in the court.
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:29.720]  And then the left showing up and then a bunch of reporters are to cover it.
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:31.720]  And there was a big collision.
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:33.720]  They even call the reporters white supremacist.
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:37.720]  That's what Trump was saying as you had good people on both sides there to see what was going on.
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:38.720]  He also had antivirus.
[2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:39.720]  It was bad.
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:40.720]  The white supremacists were bad.
[2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:43.720]  That's what Trump said word for word, which is a very balanced smart.
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:45.720]  Trump went and found out how people that were in the briefing.
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:48.720]  Like, well, you got these Antifa with Soros and them to kind of cause a problem.
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:49.720]  I got the white supremacists.
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:50.720]  I think a lot of them were fun about them.
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:53.720]  And you got reporters on both sides and just people that came out to look at it.
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:01:56.720]  And the cops locked them all together and kettled them and caused a huge explosion.
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:02:02.720]  Well, that turns into Jones says that, you know, Hillary Clinton and the CIA killed this woman.
[2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:09.720]  No, but now you see the left trying to recreate Sarasville jumping on top of cars
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:14.720]  and running out and doing it and jumping on moving police cars.
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:16.720]  And the cops see a crowd of 100 people.
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:17.720]  They don't want to shoot people.
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:18.720]  They just race off.
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:20.720]  But cop just ran into me.
[2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:22.720]  Look at the video of your TV viewer.
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:25.720]  You'd see this beating on the Prius, attacking it.
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:27.720]  And then another car chases them and other they block them in.
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:28.720]  They ram them.
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:32.720]  They attack them and the police put the guy that was being attacked in handcuffs
[2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:35.720]  because they see a mob and they want to not get in trouble.
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:36.720]  They're like, they're surprises.
[2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:38.720]  We arrested the person they were trying to kill.
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:39.720]  Later they released him.
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:41.720]  But, you know, we lionized the police.
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:44.720]  The police are followers just like the public.
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:49.720]  And in this mob psychology, you know, the fact that police didn't arrest that Mustang,
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:52.720]  didn't arrest that truck that pull in and smash like Road Warrior
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:56.720]  and block the Prius in, in LA, if you just tuned in.
[2:02:57.720 --> 2:02:59.720]  Guys, let's get into that and then get back into the big picture.
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:01.720]  We'll do a few more segments with you.
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:02.720]  Jack Hadfield.
[2:03:03.720 --> 2:03:04.720]  What is it like being in the UK watching this?
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:06.720]  Because you see Black Lives Matter, same stuff there.
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:10.720]  They're allowed to have protest, but if a church has a service, they get arrested.
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:14.720]  They now have hired goons looking through keyholes of restaurants and bars
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:17.720]  to make sure no one's secretly inside having dinner
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:19.720]  because that's a non-essential business.
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:21.720]  Only, you know, the big companies to stay open.
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:23.720]  I mean, this is a brutal vertical integration.
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:25.720]  What would you call this time we're living in?
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:34.720]  Oh, yeah, I hesitate to say the end times, but that's almost what it feels like
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:39.720]  with everything culminating into this, you know, certainly in the UK,
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:42.720]  there has been lots of, you know, authoritarian things going on,
[2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:45.720]  especially going on in Scotland, where Nicola Sturgeon,
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:52.720]  for some reason, you know, is seeing 1984 as a guidebook rather than a warning.
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:57.720]  You know, there have been, you know, students locked in their accommodations.
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:02.720]  Now in the UK, you know, you can't go to a pub or buy alcohol after 10 p.m.
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:09.720]  And on the protest that you mentioned, I went down to one of the sort of counter-protest
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:13.720]  to Black Lives Matter in London that I covered in Judean
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:15.720]  and covered on National File.
[2:04:16.720 --> 2:04:18.720]  And I saw the difference that the police made.
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:22.720]  The Black Lives Matter protest, the weekend previously,
[2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:28.720]  you know, the police were there, you know, doing, on their knees with the little fists salute in the air.
[2:04:29.720 --> 2:04:32.720]  And then, when a bunch of ordinary concerned citizens who want to protect statues
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:35.720]  and monuments from being defaced by mindless thugs,
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:40.720]  what the police do, they bring riot shields, they're vicious.
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:42.720]  I saw two people get their faces smashed in by the police.
[2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:44.720]  Imagine if that happened to Black Lives Matter.
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:47.720]  And then recently, there have been the anti-lockdown protests
[2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:50.720]  and Jeremy Corbyn, who was a previous leader of Labour Party,
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:53.720]  his brother, Piers Corbyn, organised these protests.
[2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:56.720]  He got fined £10,000 for breaking coronavirus rules.
[2:04:57.720 --> 2:05:02.720]  Where are the £10,000 fine for the Black Lives Matter and anti-protest organisers?
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:04.720]  It is ridiculous.
[2:05:05.720 --> 2:05:08.720]  It's not only is this lockdown happening,
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:14.720]  but it's all being, again, as usual, you know, the state is only cracking down
[2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:19.720]  on those people who are not involved in Antifa or BLM and who are just ordinary people.
[2:05:20.720 --> 2:05:22.720]  Those are the ones who are getting screwed by this pandemic.
[2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:25.720]  Those are the ones who are getting screwed by the police and by the state.
[2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:28.720]  And that's because it's just as bad everywhere else.
[2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:31.720]  That's because the leftist-controlled states, whether it's Australia,
[2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:35.720]  whether it's Scotland, whether it's England, whether it's Germany,
[2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:38.720]  whether it's Canada, the US, the cities are in control.
[2:05:39.720 --> 2:05:41.720]  They tell the cops, you'll be fired if you do anything to these commie groups.
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:45.720]  But then just go out and wreak havoc and you'll be promoted.
[2:05:46.720 --> 2:05:47.720]  And so there is the bad cop right there.
[2:05:48.720 --> 2:05:49.720]  I don't lionize police.
[2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:51.720]  Some of the average officer means well and it's a tough job,
[2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:55.720]  and especially in more libertarian conservative jurisdictions, cops are great people.
[2:05:56.720 --> 2:05:58.720]  But in leftist jurisdictions, they're real trash.
[2:05:59.720 --> 2:06:01.720]  And you look at the UK and I've been over there 10 times or more.
[2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:06.720]  I mean, I've been out there videotaping and doing an interview,
[2:06:07.720 --> 2:06:11.720]  even a few years ago, on the main bridge there with Big Ben in the background.
[2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:14.720]  And some Muslims didn't like me having a camera.
[2:06:15.720 --> 2:06:17.720]  So they went and complained to some Bobbies and they came over and said,
[2:06:18.720 --> 2:06:19.720]  you have a permit to be filming.
[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:23.720]  And I just said, you just think because I'm white and I'm dressing a sports jacket
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:26.720]  and stuff that I've been getting the Imperial British conditioning.
[2:06:27.720 --> 2:06:29.720]  I said, I'm kind of like the Wild Brits that ran off a few hundred years ago,
[2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:31.720]  nothing against you, buddy, but I'm not your damn slave.
[2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:33.720]  You want to arrest me, go ahead, I'll videotape all I want.
[2:06:34.720 --> 2:06:35.720]  You got cameras everywhere.
[2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:37.720]  But I mean, that's happened to me at least three times in England,
[2:06:38.720 --> 2:06:39.720]  twice on video.
[2:06:40.720 --> 2:06:42.720]  We've actually put it out where the police like, oh my God,
[2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:44.720]  we've got a white guy with a camera.
[2:06:45.720 --> 2:06:46.720]  Now the Muslims wanted to kidnap girls and rape them.
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:48.720]  That's great.
[2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:50.720]  If black folks want to stab people, that's good.
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:52.720]  I mean, we deserve it.
[2:06:53.720 --> 2:06:55.720]  But that's what's happening is literally in the UK, you live there.
[2:06:56.720 --> 2:06:57.720]  What is this?
[2:06:57.720 --> 2:07:00.720]  Is it that Indigenous Brits have become so subservient
[2:07:01.720 --> 2:07:03.720]  that the police have a fetish treating you like filth?
[2:07:05.720 --> 2:07:08.720]  Well, I think it's actually even within the last 20 years or so,
[2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:10.720]  since Blair took into government,
[2:07:11.720 --> 2:07:15.720]  the people who have been taken into joining the police
[2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:17.720]  are a different class of people.
[2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:19.720]  That's right.
[2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:21.720]  I'll start with Blair who said to get rid of the Magna Carta.
[2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:23.720]  You're really informed.
[2:07:24.720 --> 2:07:25.720]  Because that's the model of the world.
[2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:26.720]  The police, horrible demons.
[2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:30.720]  Because I mean, most UK police are like demons that I've seen.
[2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:32.720]  How do they do? Who are these people?
[2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:35.720]  Well, they changed their tactics.
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:39.720]  For one, you now have to go to university to be a police officer.
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:41.720]  They often require now a degree.
[2:07:42.720 --> 2:07:45.720]  So they can't just hire good working class lads off the street
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:48.720]  who want to actually come down and talk to the police.
[2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:50.720]  Exactly.
[2:07:51.720 --> 2:07:53.720]  They're handing people who got bullied in school,
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:58.720]  who now then power trip off of taking all these little rules
[2:07:59.720 --> 2:08:01.720]  and regulations and forcing them on a lot of people.
[2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:03.720]  And again, a lot of it is also top down.
[2:08:04.720 --> 2:08:05.720]  The police are now obsessed with numbers.
[2:08:06.720 --> 2:08:08.720]  If you're burgled, if you're robbed, if you're mugged,
[2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:11.720]  the police won't investigate because that's hard.
[2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:13.720]  That's tough.
[2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:15.720]  That takes a lot of time and organization and investigative work.
[2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:19.720]  What they will do is they'll arrest you for saying the wrong thing
[2:08:19.720 --> 2:08:22.720]  on Twitter for making a slightly edgy joke.
[2:08:23.720 --> 2:08:25.720]  That's right. They're globalist agents of the destruction
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:27.720]  of one sovereign country.
[2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:30.720]  Yeah, but that's because that's easy.
[2:08:31.720 --> 2:08:33.720]  It's very easy to get a conviction for hate speech
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:35.720]  or hate crime or whatever because the tweets right there.
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:37.720]  So the judge goes, boom, stamp.
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:39.720]  There you go. Straight off.
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:41.720]  And then you've got another nice, nice little number
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:43.720]  they can put in their tick box.
[2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:45.720]  Exactly, but they need to get pushed back.
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:47.720]  They need to get pushed back because they're not.
[2:08:47.720 --> 2:08:49.720]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:51.720]  When the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:53.720]  Let's do one more segment, gentlemen, and get back to the election.
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:56.720]  The Democrats saying if Trump can test when they can test,
[2:08:57.720 --> 2:08:58.720]  so they're going to contest it.
[2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:00.720]  If he doesn't concede, he's a dictator
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:02.720]  and then they're flooding everything with these fake ballots.
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:07.720]  I want to ask both Tom Papper and his investigative journalist
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:10.720]  who's with us what is going to unfold and their take on that.
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:14.720]  And when they leave us, there's a lot of breaking news that happened
[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:16.720]  in the last few hours that I've not reported on yet
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:18.720]  because I don't want to get it wrong.
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:20.720]  But it's some news we don't like.
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:23.720]  But I never hold back bad news.
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:26.720]  So I've got that coming up and I've got to vet this first.
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:28.720]  I've got to be very careful.
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:30.720]  And then we've got so much more to get into today.
[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:34.720]  And then the announcement of the Internet kill switch to be triggered.
[2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:36.720]  As I told you at the start of the show,
[2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:39.720]  everyone will be taken offline by the election who is pro-America.
[2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:41.720]  So get ready for that.
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:43.720]  Tucker Carlson is now being banned on Facebook.
[2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:45.720]  They don't call it a ban.
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:46.720]  They just say, well, no one can see what he has to do.
[2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:47.720]  He's like on the fam zone.
[2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:49.720]  I've got some bad news for him.
[2:09:50.720 --> 2:09:51.720]  Then I've got some really bad news and then I've got some good news.
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:54.720]  The bad news is even if Trump gets reelected,
[2:09:55.720 --> 2:09:58.720]  they're going to still trigger attempts at martial law, medical lockdowns,
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:00.720]  race riots and a depression.
[2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:02.720]  That's the globalists.
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:04.720]  They're trying to bring America to our knees.
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:06.720]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected,
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:08.720]  they're still planning to bring us to our knees
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:11.720]  and really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression,
[2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:14.720]  total control, and like Australia is already doing,
[2:10:15.720 --> 2:10:17.720]  rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing.
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:19.720]  That's the really bad news.
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:23.720]  The good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:26.720]  and the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking.
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:28.720]  So bottom line, we're in the fight.
[2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:30.720]  We're starting to win, but it's serious.
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:33.720]  So pray to God for a global awakening,
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:36.720]  support info war, spread the word and buy products at infowarstore.com.
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:40.720]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep info war sale happening right now.
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:42.720]  Please visit info store and keep us on air.
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:44.720]  Thanks so much.
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:49.720]  You noticed that over and over again,
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:52.720]  the United Nations are supposed controllers and bosses.
[2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:55.720]  The great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with
[2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:00.720]  has come out and said nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:02.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:04.720]  You get a lot of sunlight.
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:08.720]  It's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3 and it's almost impossible
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:11.720]  to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3.
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:13.720]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well,
[2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:16.720]  that's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:18.720]  because that's a vitamin D levels plunge.
[2:11:19.720 --> 2:11:22.720]  Now I pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer
[2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:26.720]  for saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[2:11:27.720 --> 2:11:30.720]  Well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:36.720]  and C, he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:39.720]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:42.720]  because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:12:11.720]  have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:24.720]  Well we're not going to take it lying now.
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:28.720]  See, I had that little floating slip there.
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:31.720]  The song says nightmares are your dreams.
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:33.720]  Nightmares are my friends.
[2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:38.720]  Alright, we knew this news when the show started
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:41.720]  and it looked pretty credible.
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:45.720]  We made some phone calls where he produces it and we confirmed it did happen.
[2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:50.720]  So I can confirm what Business Insider is saying.
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:52.720]  And the article is now on m4wars.com.
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:54.720]  Pray for Ron Paul.
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:57.720]  Libertarian icon appears to suffer a medical episode,
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:12:59.720]  probably a stroke during live interview.
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:01.720]  85 years old.
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:06.720]  Ron Paul hospitalized after suffering a parent medical incident during live stream.
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:07.720]  You know, I can't help.
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:11.720]  But I think about Ron Paul, but smile.
[2:13:12.720 --> 2:13:15.720]  And not that he's sick or in hospital, but man, let me tell you,
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:19.720]  the old Norse saying, cattle die, kinsmen die,
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:22.720]  but one thing that never dies is the fame of a dead man's deeds.
[2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:24.720]  I mean, Ron Paul, we stand on his shoulders.
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:27.720]  All he's done to expose the globalist and the New World Order
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:32.720]  and their whole system and his son now hitting on all cylinders doing a spectacular job,
[2:13:32.720 --> 2:13:35.720]  calling out anti-fun BLM terrorist organizations.
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:37.720]  And I'm sure he'll get better.
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:40.720]  He had some thick blood go through his brain or whatever.
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:43.720]  I don't really want to play the clip, but people say we're covering up.
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:45.720]  We don't play the clip here in a moment.
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:50.720]  But the old Norse hope was to die with your sword in your hand.
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:52.720]  Die on your horse.
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:54.720]  I didn't try to die on my boots on.
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:13:56.720]  That's really what I'd like to do.
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:00.720]  I don't want to die, but I mean, the best way to die would be,
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:01.720]  you know, fighting the enemy.
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:04.720]  I mean, that's really, really is the man's death.
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:06.720]  And so I'm sure Paul's going to get better.
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:07.720]  It's great.
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:10.720]  He'll be back in the game, but he appears to have a stroke on TV,
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:12.720]  but on TV fighting communism.
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:15.720]  I mean, that's, that's like in the fricking saddle, folks.
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:16.720]  That's, that's what it's about.
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:17.720]  Yeah.
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:18.720]  Okay.
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:19.720]  In your sleep.
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:20.720]  That's people all hope for that.
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:21.720]  There's no pain.
[2:14:22.720 --> 2:14:23.720]  I don't want to die in my sleep.
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:25.720]  I want to die in the horse on the horse with the sword.
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:27.720]  That's what I want.
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:30.720]  Paul looks like having a stroke on television on his Liberty report.
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:33.720]  Here it is from free market economists.
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:35.720]  It has to be liquidated.
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:37.720]  We have to get rid of that.
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:39.720]  That's a burden.
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:41.720]  We're going to bury where it is.
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:43.720]  What kind of bio?
[2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:49.720]  It's Dr. Paul.
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:51.720]  By the way, when he went to medical school,
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:54.720]  they still told you that you should donate a quarter of your time to charity.
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:56.720]  He donated up to a half of his time for charity
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:00.720]  and worked at delivery rooms in the overnight shifts
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:04.720]  in the inner city of Houston as a volunteer for more than 15 years
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:06.720]  when he had children was on.
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:11.720]  I mean, I will to give value doing that man
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:13.720]  working three nights a week for free.
[2:15:14.720 --> 2:15:16.720]  They said they would buy you dinner and a coffee.
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:18.720]  He would get a meal and a coffee.
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:22.720]  He did that three nights a week for more than 15 years.
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:23.720]  They got to run for Congress.
[2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:25.720]  That's a servant.
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:30.720]  Tom, we'll do one more segment and I'll hold you guys over.
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:32.720]  I want to get to the big issues.
[2:15:33.720 --> 2:15:34.720]  I get tears in my eyes.
[2:15:35.720 --> 2:15:36.720]  All the fighting that Ron Paul has done.
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:38.720]  Ron Paul, when he was calling my show in 1996,
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:40.720]  was after running for Congress to get back in
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:42.720]  and all the experiences to see that.
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:44.720]  I can't help but be proud of him.
[2:15:45.720 --> 2:15:47.720]  Literally fighting nonstop until he has a stroke on air.
[2:15:48.720 --> 2:15:49.720]  That's what I strive to be.
[2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:51.720]  What do you think?
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:54.720]  I'd love to be 85 on air having a stroke that long fighting.
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:15:56.720]  There's something really manly about this.
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:15:58.720]  What do you think?
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:01.720]  I wholeheartedly agree with you actually.
[2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:03.720]  I watched it just before I went on with you
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:05.720]  and I was kind of off kilter for the first couple minutes
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:07.720]  because it was just so painful to watch.
[2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:10.720]  But if you think about it, this is a man who basically
[2:16:11.720 --> 2:16:12.720]  since the 70s, since the 80s,
[2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:15.720]  when he was first running for president as a libertarian
[2:16:15.720 --> 2:16:19.720]  has dedicated his life to trying to save this country
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:23.720]  down to his own son continuing the fight.
[2:16:24.720 --> 2:16:28.720]  So obviously I pray that he recovers.
[2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:30.720]  It was horrifying to watch.
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:32.720]  But I think you're right.
[2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:35.720]  I think that is one hell of a way to take an injury
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:38.720]  literally at the command center in the desk.
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:42.720]  I mean, I hope Alex that someday you're 90 years old
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:44.720]  and still going and you get to have your dream
[2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:46.720]  of dying with your boots on.
[2:16:47.720 --> 2:16:48.720]  I hear that.
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:50.720]  I want to get your riders take on this.
[2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:52.720]  Jack's taking on this.
[2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:54.720]  But think about us, though, as an nationalist patriot.
[2:16:55.720 --> 2:16:56.720]  It's just truthful people.
[2:16:57.720 --> 2:16:58.720]  If we were Democrats, we'd say he didn't have a stroke.
[2:16:59.720 --> 2:17:00.720]  He's not in the hospital.
[2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:02.720]  He's fine.
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:04.720]  Look at Joe Biden.
[2:17:05.720 --> 2:17:06.720]  He's been having all these strokes.
[2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:08.720]  Doesn't know what planet he's on.
[2:17:09.720 --> 2:17:10.720]  Jack Hadfield, you want to comment on that?
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:13.720]  I do expect that's why I do feel a little sorry for Joe sometimes
[2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:16.720]  because he's clearly got dementia or Alzheimer's
[2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:19.720]  and had potential strokes, as you said.
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:21.720]  But the Democrats are still they're forcing him out.
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:25.720]  They're plattering him up and they're putting him to work
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:28.720]  when really he should have been retired years ago
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:31.720]  and just enjoying his last years.
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:33.720]  My dad's 70.
[2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:36.720]  And he's a smart guy, but he's not like he was.
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:38.720]  I'm not like I was at 46.
[2:17:38.720 --> 2:17:40.720]  And I'm trying to get my dad out of the company just so he can relax with my mom.
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:42.720]  I couldn't imagine him at almost.
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:44.720]  How old is Joe?
[2:17:45.720 --> 2:17:46.720]  Almost 80 years old.
[2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:48.720]  Like he's 77 or something like that.
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:50.720]  78.
[2:17:51.720 --> 2:17:52.720]  I mean, he is not.
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:54.720]  I'm sorry, Jack.
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:17:57.720]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:02.720]  And as you said, it's just infasional to believe somebody at 78 years old
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:07.720]  is being counted as being the next president of this country.
[2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:11.720]  Obviously, Trump is a few years younger, but he has all his faculties together.
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:13.720]  He's clearly sharp.
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:15.720]  He's clearly wired and he knows what he's doing.
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:18.720]  And he will only probably have then one more term left if he comes back.
[2:18:19.720 --> 2:18:23.720]  Biden, if he wins, which I really hope he doesn't,
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:25.720]  he'll probably be Electoral fraud if he does.
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:27.720]  But then he could have a whole eight terms.
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:30.720]  He would be what, 86?
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:33.720]  By that time, that's that's insane.
[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:36.720]  Like you really should have been retired there.
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:38.720]  But again, we know he's a placeholder.
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:40.720]  We should speak to that.
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:42.720]  I mean, we first said this years ago that he would be their placeholder.
[2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:46.720]  Now CNN Kamala Harris says, oh, it's the Harris Biden administration.
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:48.720]  CNN says that she's just a placeholder.
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:50.720]  I want your take on that.
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:52.720]  But briefly, here's some good news from my memory.
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:54.720]  Also, what I saw him do may not be a stroke.
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:18:57.720]  It could have been a seizure because my uncle was in a motorcycle wreck.
[2:18:57.720 --> 2:18:59.720]  My dad's brother, he's all there mentally.
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:02.720]  But occasionally you'll be at dinner with him or, you know, at the beer camp.
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:04.720]  He'll go, yeah, I tell you, it's really good meal.
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:08.720]  He has these little, little small seizures.
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:10.720]  I forget the name.
[2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:12.720]  It could have been a seizure.
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:14.720]  That's a lot better than a stroke pepper.
[2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:16.720]  Well, I'll just kind of add on to that.
[2:19:17.720 --> 2:19:19.720]  I mean, we all remember the bizarre video of Hillary Clinton from 2016
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:22.720]  where she's, she has a weird freak out moment on her face
[2:19:23.720 --> 2:19:25.720]  and says, like, try the chai latte or something.
[2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:27.720]  So that's something that you definitely see with older folks.
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:32.720]  And especially at 85, I could see something like that sort of happening.
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:34.720]  It's very sad.
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:38.720]  But I'll also say that this is a guy who lives very cleanly, lives very,
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:40.720]  very healthy person.
[2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:42.720]  Obviously he's a doctor.
[2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:44.720]  So even though, I mean, if it is a stroke,
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:47.720]  the odds are not necessarily in his favor being 85 years old.
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:50.720]  I'd say that he probably has the vitality.
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:53.720]  I mean, this is an 85 year old who does a TV show every day.
[2:19:53.720 --> 2:19:56.720]  Alex, and you and I both know that that is not easy on your brain,
[2:19:57.720 --> 2:19:58.720]  on your body, on anything.
[2:19:59.720 --> 2:20:00.720]  It takes a lot of energy to be there.
[2:20:01.720 --> 2:20:02.720]  Well, he used to, he used to, or I might.
[2:20:03.720 --> 2:20:04.720]  People call it workaholic Trump.
[2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:07.720]  I mean, Ron Paul worked 18 hours a day in Congress.
[2:20:08.720 --> 2:20:09.720]  It was well known.
[2:20:10.720 --> 2:20:11.720]  I mean, eight.
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:14.720]  I mean, we're talking totally disciplined other than 5 a.m.
[2:20:15.720 --> 2:20:16.720]  a nighttime bike ride for an hour.
[2:20:17.720 --> 2:20:18.720]  That's what he does.
[2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:20.720]  5 a.m. And he did drink beer.
[2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:22.720]  But I mean, that's it, man. Never smoked, never did anything.
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:26.720]  I wish we could all say that, Alex.
[2:20:27.720 --> 2:20:28.720]  We'd all be a lot healthier if we could.
[2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:30.720]  Absolutely.
[2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:32.720]  All right.
[2:20:33.720 --> 2:20:34.720]  Gentlemen, let's do one more segment because it's too informative.
[2:20:35.720 --> 2:20:36.720]  I want to get back into the election.
[2:20:37.720 --> 2:20:38.720]  There are tips to steal the election with both of you.
[2:20:39.720 --> 2:20:40.720]  On the other side, Tom Papert and Jake Hadfield.
[2:20:41.720 --> 2:20:42.720]  Stay with us.
[2:20:43.720 --> 2:20:44.720]  We'll be right back.
[2:20:45.720 --> 2:20:46.720]  NationalFile.com.
[2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:48.720]  This will turn on the juice boy.
[2:20:48.720 --> 2:20:49.720]  I'm a vending machine.
[2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:51.720]  I'm a vending machine.
[2:20:52.720 --> 2:20:53.720]  A vending machine.
[2:20:54.720 --> 2:20:55.720]  We are on a long walk.
[2:20:56.720 --> 2:20:57.720]  We're witnessing the Black Lives Matter anti-fariats
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:20:59.720]  and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed
[2:21:00.720 --> 2:21:01.720]  by a handful of top billionaires,
[2:21:02.720 --> 2:21:03.720]  led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos,
[2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:05.720]  of course, Tim Cook, and others.
[2:21:06.720 --> 2:21:08.720]  They set up there with their trillions of dollars
[2:21:09.720 --> 2:21:10.720]  they control in their companies.
[2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:12.720]  They're hundreds of billions of dollars individually,
[2:21:13.720 --> 2:21:14.720]  leveraging that against us
[2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:16.720]  and trying to create an artificial revolution
[2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:20.680]  official revolution against local government and police.
[2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:22.000]  And the mayors are, again,
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:23.600]  they're playing their political game
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:25.720]  to try to trigger the complete breakdown
[2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:27.640]  of the United States and Western Europe
[2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:29.720]  to show these billionaires can come in
[2:21:29.720 --> 2:21:31.640]  and buy it all up for billions on the dollar.
[2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:34.040]  That's why I'm so angry that these globalists,
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:35.280]  because when you're looking at them,
[2:21:35.280 --> 2:21:37.560]  they're the ones that sit in their councils
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:40.160]  and have decided to run these plans against us.
[2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:43.280]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with.
[2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:47.040]  It's us or them, period.
[2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:50.480]  Remember, the enemy is working around the clock
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:53.040]  to suppress voices of independent people
[2:21:53.040 --> 2:21:55.720]  all over the world.
[2:21:55.720 --> 2:22:00.600]  The globalists have a plan for total vertical integration.
[2:22:00.600 --> 2:22:03.560]  Absolute authoritarianism to where
[2:22:03.560 --> 2:22:09.360]  you are a captive of their devices, of their control.
[2:22:09.360 --> 2:22:12.560]  But that is only a means to an end.
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:15.760]  Once they have the electronic straight jacket in place,
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:17.760]  they are on record that they will bring in force
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:21.960]  inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse.
[2:22:21.960 --> 2:22:25.400]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:29.240]  actually give people polio and actually give people cancer.
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:31.200]  Most cancer is viral.
[2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:32.720]  That's a big secret.
[2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:35.120]  But the secret is beginning to come out.
[2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:37.680]  It's even in the associated press.
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:41.560]  Remember, all of these banned videos and reports
[2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:42.920]  are banned out of video.
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:47.080]  But only you can share them and save humanity.
[2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:49.560]  If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks
[2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:53.080]  that finance and control them, to a man and to a woman,
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:54.800]  they believe there's too many people on the earth.
[2:22:54.800 --> 2:22:56.800]  And they constantly whine about when
[2:22:56.800 --> 2:22:59.080]  they want to go to a mountain top or a national park,
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:01.480]  they have to look at us, the common people.
[2:23:01.480 --> 2:23:03.360]  They have to look at the proletariat.
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:04.680]  They have to look at the scum.
[2:23:04.680 --> 2:23:06.600]  That's why they love the lockdown.
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:07.880]  Putting muzzles on us.
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:09.760]  That gives them a big thrill, controlling
[2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:11.440]  where we can go, what we can do.
[2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:14.880]  Bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns.
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:18.080]  All of it is a vertical integration, consolidation,
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:21.400]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender,
[2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:24.480]  which is taking sterilant vaccines day one.
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:27.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over.
[2:23:27.120 --> 2:23:28.600]  Playtime's over.
[2:23:28.600 --> 2:23:30.160]  They used all the entertainment and garbage
[2:23:30.160 --> 2:23:31.640]  to put us into a trance.
[2:23:31.640 --> 2:23:34.120]  And now the spider's moving in for the kill.
[2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:34.920]  You know this.
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:35.720]  I know this.
[2:23:35.720 --> 2:23:37.000]  It's all out in the open.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.120]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:40.880]  Well, the first thing is identify the enemy.
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:41.960]  Identify the enemy.
[2:23:41.960 --> 2:23:42.960]  Identify the enemy.
[2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:45.280]  Identify your enemy now.
[2:23:49.280 --> 2:23:52.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:23:52.120 --> 2:23:55.200]  You are listening to an infowars.com front line report.
[2:23:55.200 --> 2:24:22.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:27.000]  Writer's on the store.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.560]  Writer's on the store.
[2:24:29.560 --> 2:24:31.440]  Man, I just smiled thinking about Ron Paul.
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:34.560]  Not that he had a stroke or a seizure on here today.
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:39.840]  It's just, that guy's like original OG, man.
[2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:41.720]  PT.
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:43.280]  You get dialed into the real universe, folks.
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:44.320]  All it matters is you stand up and you
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:46.280]  can see what's all that cares about.
[2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:47.480]  What is somebody like Ron Paul?
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:51.160]  I mean, I'm just very satisfied, very satisfied.
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:55.760]  And in my sadness, this makes me appreciate his great work.
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:24:57.760]  Gentlemen, I want to give you each about five minutes,
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:24:59.240]  because I've been breaking in a lot.
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:00.560]  Tom Pappert, nationalfile.com.
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:03.960]  Jack Hadfield, great busker journals, also a national file.
[2:25:03.960 --> 2:25:08.240]  Jack Hatters is his handle at Twitter.
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:10.280]  Other points you want to make that I want you to comment on,
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:12.560]  the Democrats admit they're going to contest the election.
[2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:13.920]  They've been caught in fraud everywhere.
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:16.080]  They're arresting people all over the place.
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:20.440]  Democrat counties organizing, sending in the ballots filled
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:21.440]  out with dead people's names.
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:23.160]  I mean, it's all over the news.
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:25.360]  But it's on local news, Facebook, Twitter.
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:27.040]  They're all blocking it.
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:29.560]  And then now this, nationalfile.com,
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:32.480]  Facebook throttles official Tucker Girls' page.
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:34.840]  Remember, shadow batting didn't exist just a year ago.
[2:25:34.840 --> 2:25:37.920]  Now it's, oh, we throttled you down to 5%.
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:40.200]  Facebook throttles official Tucker Girls' page
[2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.280]  with reduced distribution 40 days before election.
[2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:45.960]  So because he's got more viewers online than he does with $4
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:51.640]  million on Fox, and that is just an amazing moment to just see
[2:25:51.640 --> 2:25:54.440]  the internet kill switch being put into place here.
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:57.840]  So both of you take on that.
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:00.640]  Well, Alex, I think that it's all very tied together.
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:03.480]  I think that the foot soldiers, the Civil War re-enactors
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:07.880]  we're seeing on the street, they are being covered up for by Facebook,
[2:26:07.880 --> 2:26:09.120]  by Twitter for a reason.
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:12.720]  Tucker Carlson, besides yourself, and Tucker is, of course,
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:14.960]  somehow still technically in the mainstream.
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:16.480]  They try to kick him out every single week,
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:17.760]  and they haven't done it yet.
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:20.280]  But you and Tucker are essentially
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:22.720]  the two big media personalities right now
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:25.520]  who are putting a spotlight on the real globalist plan
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:29.360]  to steal the election, to destroy American cities with rioters,
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:31.040]  and where the money is really coming from,
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:32.080]  which, of course, now we know.
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:33.600]  Bill, I mean, we've known for years,
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:35.400]  but now we have the smoking gun.
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:36.280]  Bill Gates, George George.
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:37.440]  You don't have just the money.
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:39.680]  You have their paid operative handing out the signs
[2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:41.520]  out of the back of a truck.
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:43.440]  Exactly, that she apparently paid for.
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:45.880]  But it was just with her money that she made with her side hustle.
[2:26:45.880 --> 2:26:49.400]  So it's not just like having the Don give the money to buy the cocaine.
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:52.120]  You have the person working for the Don delivering the cocaine.
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:54.480]  I mean, hypothetically, I mean, it's an allegory.
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:58.520]  You have the whole chain, the whole open and shut case.
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:01.280]  Exactly, which, I mean, they've never screwed up like this before.
[2:27:01.280 --> 2:27:03.760]  And I think all of this, from the censorship,
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:07.920]  to Holly Zoller on the street, to now them not even firing her.
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:10.640]  And instead, coming after a national file, which we expected,
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:13.280]  it all just reeks of desperation.
[2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:16.520]  And I think as we go into this, more Americans are waking up.
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:20.120]  I mean, the New York Times, Alex, is reporting that John Podesta says
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:22.120]  that this thing should never be settled.
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:24.160]  And we're going to have a civil war and break up the country
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:26.520]  with a second inauguration in California.
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:28.760]  That's Hillary Clinton's right-hand man.
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:30.960]  So you can't hide from this anymore.
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:33.160]  Normal Americans, I think, are waking up.
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:37.400]  We're living in a paradigm that's not dissimilar to North Korea or China,
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:42.440]  where what you see on social media is not what normal people are saying on the streets.
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:44.000]  And it's shocking that we're there.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.480]  And it's shocking that we're there so fast.
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:49.680]  But if we can keep waking people up, three in this country,
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:53.040]  and we can get this news to the president through his son,
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:56.880]  through the other few elements of the White House that are on our side,
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:28:00.280]  I think that not only will we win come November, Alex,
[2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:02.280]  I think we've got a big chance of rolling back
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:04.600]  some of the last few decades of despair.
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:06.720]  Yeah, I mean, I've been on there 26 years.
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:09.000]  I've been politically involved for almost 30.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:12.800]  And this is like 50 times crazier than anything we ever even thought of.
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:15.920]  I mean, and it's getting crazier by the day, and I want to explain this to people.
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:18.680]  Everybody keeps thinking 38 days.
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:23.600]  No, it all starts in 38 days with the 79 days of hell.
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:25.560]  So it's 116 days to inauguration.
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:30.920]  But the real hell starts in 38 days, 79 days of hell.
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:34.480]  And we better get that term out, hashtag 79 days of hell
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:36.680]  so that we can start war gaming and getting folks ready.
[2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:39.360]  Because here's the thing, Trump comes out and is like,
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:40.440]  well, I'm not going to use the military.
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:42.480]  The Democrats are like, well, you're going to use the military.
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:43.720]  Trump goes, no, we're not.
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:47.520]  So then they spin it and go, oh, Trump's
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:49.320]  planning to contest the election when they are.
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:51.960]  So everything they're doing, they're framing him.
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:54.480]  He doesn't just need to come out and say they're stealing the election
[2:28:54.480 --> 2:28:55.720]  and using fake ballots.
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:58.840]  He needs to expose all of it so they're not
[2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:03.560]  the ones that map out the psychological battlefield ahead of time.
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:08.720]  We have to, 38 days now, affect what happens in the 79 days
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:11.920]  of hell when they contest it and throw us into a civil war.
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:13.200]  They're saying that.
[2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:14.960]  So we're all about winning the election.
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:16.920]  We've already won the damn thing.
[2:29:16.920 --> 2:29:18.160]  America woke up.
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:20.320]  So now the deep state criminals are going to do this.
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:24.080]  That's what I'm getting at, Jack.
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:25.440]  Well, exactly.
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:27.560]  I believe there was something that came out recently
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:30.480]  where it said that people who are actually in the zones
[2:29:30.480 --> 2:29:33.040]  affected by these riots support the president
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:35.280]  at a ratio of about two to one.
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:38.760]  Because they can see exactly what's happening on their streets.
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:40.720]  They can see the destruction of their communities,
[2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:44.920]  their neighborhoods, their businesses, their homes.
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:47.760]  They can see it's Antifa.
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:50.120]  And Black Lives Matter riots has taken them down.
[2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:53.960]  And they can see that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and whatever,
[2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:56.200]  they've been saying Black Lives Matter forever.
[2:29:56.200 --> 2:29:57.160]  That's what kicked it off.
[2:29:57.160 --> 2:29:59.400]  And they're saying, well, hang on.
[2:29:59.400 --> 2:30:01.160]  It's the Democrats who've been supporting this.
[2:30:01.160 --> 2:30:04.360]  Well, obviously, I don't want any more of this happening.
[2:30:04.360 --> 2:30:07.480]  So clearly, I've got to vote President Trump in November.
[2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:11.480]  Yeah, I think the only way that President Trump won't win
[2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:14.200]  is if the Democrats actually fake it.
[2:30:14.200 --> 2:30:15.120]  And we can see it.
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:18.200]  We've seen it with all these mail-in votes,
[2:30:18.200 --> 2:30:20.120]  with the universal mail-in voting,
[2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:21.800]  with all these ballots that have been lost,
[2:30:21.800 --> 2:30:25.520]  well, lost in quotation marks, more likely thrown away
[2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:30.680]  by some, well, either a mailman who's not a fan of Trump
[2:30:30.680 --> 2:30:31.880]  or just dumped them off on the way
[2:30:31.880 --> 2:30:34.120]  to sort the votes out as a voting station
[2:30:34.120 --> 2:30:36.560]  or Democrat operatives themselves.
[2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:39.440]  They're doing everything they can possible
[2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:41.720]  to stop the president winning the election.
[2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:42.560]  We know this.
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:45.720]  And so, as you said, 79 days a hell.
[2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:47.400]  Jack, because you're very right.
[2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:49.160]  Two to one, even in Democrat areas,
[2:30:49.160 --> 2:30:50.400]  people are saying they're going to vote Trump
[2:30:50.400 --> 2:30:53.200]  after they've been stopped at checkpoints by mobs,
[2:30:53.200 --> 2:30:55.200]  attacked, seen houses burned down.
[2:30:55.200 --> 2:30:56.560]  Black people's homes burned down.
[2:30:56.560 --> 2:30:57.560]  Mainly Black businesses.
[2:30:57.560 --> 2:30:58.520]  They're like, what the hell?
[2:30:58.520 --> 2:30:59.920]  Those Black folks got burned out.
[2:30:59.920 --> 2:31:01.800]  They're voting against the Democrats.
[2:31:01.800 --> 2:31:02.640]  They get it.
[2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:05.080]  But that's tiny minorities, not racially,
[2:31:05.080 --> 2:31:06.600]  but minorities are being burned out.
[2:31:06.600 --> 2:31:08.640]  It's still big, but I'm not minimizing it,
[2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:10.320]  but it's small areas.
[2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:11.160]  Distributed.
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:14.840]  So the Democrats are firing up
[2:31:14.840 --> 2:31:17.720]  their burn the country down base in a beta test.
[2:31:17.720 --> 2:31:19.400]  So people go, oh, this is backfiring.
[2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:21.040]  They already know they're losing.
[2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:22.920]  So they're just firing up the mobs
[2:31:22.920 --> 2:31:24.360]  to burn the whole thing out,
[2:31:24.360 --> 2:31:26.120]  to try to drive Trump out of power.
[2:31:26.120 --> 2:31:28.320]  That's what people have to not be so confident,
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:29.960]  because I know their battle plan.
[2:31:29.960 --> 2:31:32.320]  I said what they would do and now they're doing it.
[2:31:32.320 --> 2:31:34.280]  So that's what I'm getting at here is,
[2:31:34.280 --> 2:31:35.480]  what do we do to stop them?
[2:31:35.480 --> 2:31:37.120]  We can't just sit here idly by it.
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:37.960]  I'm serious.
[2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:39.360]  If Homeland Security won't do it,
[2:31:39.360 --> 2:31:40.560]  if Trump won't do it,
[2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:41.880]  I'm not even saying I'm going to do it
[2:31:41.880 --> 2:31:43.040]  because I don't have the expertise.
[2:31:43.040 --> 2:31:45.800]  But what do you do up against organized crime
[2:31:45.800 --> 2:31:47.400]  that's getting ready to burn the whole country down?
[2:31:47.400 --> 2:31:50.320]  I mean, we can't just sit here, Tom Pappert.
[2:31:50.320 --> 2:31:52.920]  Well, that's the question that I keep coming to,
[2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:53.880]  because you're right, Alex.
[2:31:53.880 --> 2:31:56.200]  I mean, I think I said it on your show over a year ago.
[2:31:56.200 --> 2:31:58.640]  I think the Democrats are sitting out this election,
[2:31:58.640 --> 2:32:01.440]  but I was wrong in that they still want to win.
[2:32:01.440 --> 2:32:02.520]  They don't want to get the votes,
[2:32:02.520 --> 2:32:03.880]  but they want to get the presidency
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:05.040]  and they're going to do it
[2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:06.200]  through everything that you've described.
[2:32:06.200 --> 2:32:08.120]  By confusing it, and that's why everybody loves
[2:32:08.120 --> 2:32:09.240]  Carl Rittenhouse.
[2:32:09.240 --> 2:32:10.360]  We don't love the death that happened.
[2:32:10.360 --> 2:32:11.680]  He went out and was a medic.
[2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:14.680]  He stood up, everybody just sees, there's a man.
[2:32:14.680 --> 2:32:17.480]  He actually went to a problem when the police wouldn't,
[2:32:17.480 --> 2:32:18.320]  and now he's in jail.
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:19.720]  People resonate with it.
[2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:22.800]  You know, he's a huge in Japan, in Eastern Europe.
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:25.600]  I mean, that guy is, everybody gets it.
[2:32:25.600 --> 2:32:26.440]  No, absolutely.
[2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:29.040]  I mean, you've got soccer stadiums holding signs
[2:32:29.040 --> 2:32:32.160]  saying Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero in Bulgaria of all places.
[2:32:32.160 --> 2:32:34.160]  So yes, alpha males see this.
[2:32:34.160 --> 2:32:37.640]  And so the conventional GOP wisdom is, Alex,
[2:32:37.640 --> 2:32:39.920]  and I'm channeling our friend Roger Stone
[2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:42.280]  from four years ago is to just get out the vote
[2:32:42.280 --> 2:32:44.720]  in such large numbers, not by mail-ins,
[2:32:44.720 --> 2:32:48.280]  but same-day voting, that they cannot steal the election.
[2:32:48.280 --> 2:32:49.920]  But Trump will win.
[2:32:49.920 --> 2:32:51.400]  They're just going to say he didn't.
[2:32:51.400 --> 2:32:52.240]  That's what I'm saying.
[2:32:52.240 --> 2:32:55.200]  Everybody knows it's a Trump landslide, but that's done.
[2:32:55.200 --> 2:32:56.880]  And everybody should go vote, absolutely.
[2:32:56.880 --> 2:32:57.800]  It's more critical than ever.
[2:32:57.800 --> 2:32:59.400]  But they're going to contest it.
[2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:01.080]  So what do we do about that?
[2:33:01.080 --> 2:33:03.120]  That's the big question.
[2:33:03.120 --> 2:33:05.400]  Well, and so I think the only, I mean,
[2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:07.160]  and because I'm not in the Oval Office,
[2:33:07.160 --> 2:33:08.320]  I wish I had a better answer.
[2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:10.080]  What I've been telling people is we
[2:33:10.080 --> 2:33:12.480]  have to make the numbers to where they can't confuse us.
[2:33:12.480 --> 2:33:12.980]  I agree.
[2:33:12.980 --> 2:33:15.320]  It's got to be such a mega landslides the answer.
[2:33:15.320 --> 2:33:18.960]  But I'm saying ahead of time, Trump has to annihilate them.
[2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:21.040]  They criticize him when he says his election fraud,
[2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:21.720]  so he stops.
[2:33:21.720 --> 2:33:24.040]  No, that exposed the fraud.
[2:33:24.040 --> 2:33:26.680]  What Ken Paxton did, arresting 138 people
[2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:29.400]  for fake mail-in ballots, that's the answer.
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:31.000]  Prosecute them now.
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:34.920]  Don't wait like Durham with his thumb up as damn.
[2:33:34.920 --> 2:33:35.960]  You know where?
[2:33:35.960 --> 2:33:36.760]  Gentlemen, we love you.
[2:33:36.760 --> 2:33:38.360]  We look forward to having you back soon.
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:39.200]  We salute you.
[2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:43.400]  38 days out, 116 out from inauguration, 77 days of hell.
[2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:45.280]  Start in T minus 38 days.
[2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:48.760]  We've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown.
[2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:49.600]  And it's horrible.
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:52.440]  And it's killing millions of people via starvation.
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:55.600]  But the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening
[2:33:55.600 --> 2:33:56.800]  as well.
[2:33:56.800 --> 2:34:00.640]  The general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates.
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:03.400]  He's the most unpopular person on earth.
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:05.040]  People know he's not a doctor.
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:07.000]  People know he's a eugenicist.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.160]  The population knows that his vaccines that he pushes
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:13.040]  have been filled with cancer viruses, polio,
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:14.320]  sterilants, and more.
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:16.240]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:19.200]  So now they are beginning to understand
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:21.080]  that we the people know that there
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:23.200]  is a corporate global government.
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:24.840]  And the beast top tech billionaires
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:27.160]  sit in meetings and decide to pull
[2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:30.400]  the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:31.240]  witnessing.
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:33.560]  So remember that and let them know
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:36.840]  that we know who they are and what they've done.
[2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:40.360]  And we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:43.440]  They are the enemies of humanity.
[2:34:43.440 --> 2:34:45.680]  They want you dead.
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:49.400]  Servants of Satan are working around the clock to silence
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:52.640]  the people of not just the United States, but of the world.
[2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:54.520]  Because there is a great awakening taking place.
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:56.840]  Everyone I talk to, everywhere I go,
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:34:59.640]  people that weren't even religious or spiritual
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:02.560]  now understand this fight between good and evil.
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:04.280]  And they're finding Christ.
[2:35:04.280 --> 2:35:06.240]  And they're finding the prophecies
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:08.320]  that aren't like Nostradamus, they,
[2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:11.680]  but are very, very detailed and extremely specific,
[2:35:11.680 --> 2:35:15.920]  that are now coming through at a frightening rate.
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:17.720]  Frightening because so many people
[2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:21.240]  are still living under the control of the god of this world.
[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:25.160]  Satan did not realize that their immortal souls
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:27.160]  are in grave danger.
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:29.480]  Do not fear he who can kill the body.
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:34.080]  Fear he who can kill the soul as the good book warns us.
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:36.280]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm very honored to be on air
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:37.600]  still during this time.
[2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:39.600]  Every day we're still on air as a blessing.
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:40.960]  So please pray for him for worse.
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:41.880]  Pray for yourself.
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:42.720]  Pray for the children.
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:43.600]  Pray for the world.
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:44.600]  God bless you all.
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:46.840]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci.
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:49.400]  Does it matter if I'm invested with Bill Gates
[2:35:49.400 --> 2:35:52.120]  in many of the same vaccines I push on you?
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:54.000]  It's the same thing with the health ministers
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:55.720]  in the UK and Europe.
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:35:57.760]  They're all invested as well.
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:35:59.520]  But the governments have decided
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:01.920]  there's not a conflict of interest.
[2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:06.360]  Also, the media is going to call me a genius
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:08.920]  when the second wave I've been warning of comes
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:12.040]  in the fall and winter, because we're going to count
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:15.080]  all the flu and all the pneumonia and cold death
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:17.480]  of old people again.
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:20.560]  And the lockdown will never end.
[2:36:20.560 --> 2:36:24.520]  That's why we're saying the vaccine will take several years.
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:26.680]  But don't worry, it'll come out.
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:27.960]  I'll make a bunch of money.
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:29.200]  You'll get sick.
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:33.120]  But that's OK, because I ran the Wuhan lab,
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:34.440]  and it's all public.
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:36.520]  But I don't get in trouble.
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:39.920]  If you talk bad about me, we use pick-deck to eat.
[2:36:39.920 --> 2:36:44.080]  If you talk bad about me, we use pick-deck to shut you up.
[2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:13.360]  And they all share the data with each other
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:15.600]  of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:18.160]  including having apps turn on and listen
[2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:21.600]  to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do,
[2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:24.200]  and then putting databases, transcripts,
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:27.840]  of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:29.880]  Your phone is spying on you, and companies
[2:37:29.880 --> 2:37:31.920]  are generating secret surveillance scores
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:33.120]  based on information.
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:35.520]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:36.200]  Score.

[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:51.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:52.680]  Whistling.
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:37:59.360]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:02.000]  on this Friday edition.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:03.760]  Earlier, at the start of the second hour,
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:06.520]  something happened to Jeff Bezos' little drone.
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:08.800]  He's now deploying to people's houses.
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:09.680]  Here's the video.
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:12.080]  Radio listeners can find it as soon as we post it,
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:14.240]  infowarstore.com.
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:17.720]  This is what I say to Jeff Bezos and Amazon's in-home
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:19.120]  surveillance drones.
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  This drone does not have rights.
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:24.440]  It is not a sentient being.
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:27.560]  It is controlled by the globalist, and it is a tool.
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:29.360]  So that I am not against technology,
[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:32.400]  but I am against the technology that they have deployed
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:34.280]  and developed to replace us.
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:36.960]  We change our environment as humans.
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:38.080]  We conquer the elements.
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:39.160]  We conquer the wild.
[2:38:39.160 --> 2:38:42.000]  We're not conquered by other humans playing games
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.720]  as psychotics, and it's the sort of truth
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:47.600]  that is going to slice through the lies and our declaration
[2:38:47.600 --> 2:38:51.000]  that we are in charge of this planet, not the globalist
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:52.360]  and not their machines.
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:55.080]  So to Jeff Bezos and all the globalist technocrats
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:57.400]  and Tim Cook and their slave camps in China
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:38:58.800]  and all their evil, they try to cover up
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:01.440]  with Black Lives Matter, Marxism and the cop-killing,
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:04.760]  I say to you, your technocracy is dead on arrival.
[2:39:07.260 --> 2:39:08.520]  You understand that?
[2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:14.080]  We are in charge of the planet, not Soros and not Satan.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:17.520]  Do you understand that Soros?
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:19.160]  You pathetic maggot.
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:21.960]  We are in charge, not you.
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:23.040]  Is that clear?
[2:39:23.040 --> 2:39:23.880]  Is that clear?
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:26.160]  You little maggot and your little maggot son,
[2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:27.480]  you understand that?
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:29.920]  You think you're gonna have this fight
[2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:31.200]  and have robots win it?
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:32.040]  No!
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:35.880]  We'll defeat you and your goddamn robots.
[2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:38.520]  You understand that, damn you to hell, you Satanist.
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:46.320]  By the way, a Baptist preacher is a Pharisee,
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:47.680]  not all of them, but some of them.
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:48.800]  They'll tell you when I said,
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:51.800]  damn Soros to hell, that was the Lord's name and fame.
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:54.880]  No, I am asking God to please damn them to hell.
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:57.360]  You don't take God's name and fame
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:00.080]  with the definition of fame means not meaning,
[2:40:00.080 --> 2:40:01.360]  but taking it lightly.
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:04.120]  When I say God, please damn them to hell
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:06.880]  and protect us, I say it in a blood oath
[2:40:06.880 --> 2:40:09.280]  and I'm willing to die.
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:10.720]  That's the opposite of vain.
[2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:15.360]  All right, let's hit some final news before Paul,
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:18.400]  Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:20.240]  I had so many stacks of election fraud news,
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:21.240]  they've all mixed together here,
[2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:23.400]  but I think these next two stacks have them,
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:24.720]  mainly during the break,
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:27.280]  I was trying to fish through them and get it together.
[2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:30.520]  The idea that there's no election fraud,
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:33.920]  when Democrats wrote the book on it is really hilarious.
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:37.000]  Attorney General Ken Paxson of Texas
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.760]  goes after male ballot fraud in Gregg County,
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:43.040]  arrest 118, 134, why is that 118?
[2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:44.960]  That's in my head earlier, I just said that.
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:47.040]  See, my memory fails, it was 134.
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:51.080]  Felony charges filed against Gregg County Commissioner
[2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:56.080]  and three associates show the male voter fraud is real
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:40:58.440]  and that's why elections busted.
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:01.200]  County workers improperly open,
[2:41:01.200 --> 2:41:03.280]  discarded Trump ballots in Pennsylvania.
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:07.240]  Do you think deranged anti-Troppers
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:08.560]  would do something like that?
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:10.480]  They're sure to tell me that mosquitoes drink blood
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:12.560]  or bears crap in the woods.
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:15.400]  And it just goes on from there.
[2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:19.480]  Again, Attorney General Ken Paxson
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:23.520]  announced 134 felony voter charges,
[2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:26.200]  voter fraud charges in connection to 2018,
[2:41:26.200 --> 2:41:29.160]  the impromptu area back when they did it then.
[2:41:29.160 --> 2:41:33.720]  And remember they beta tested it in Texas and other areas.
[2:41:33.720 --> 2:41:38.200]  Texas official, arrest of felony election fraud charges
[2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:39.960]  could face 99 year sentence.
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:46.040]  That's who these Democrats are, 134 felonies.
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:51.040]  That's a big deal and it just goes on from there.
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:41:55.920]  I've got some COVID news I wanna hit too, that's really good
[2:41:55.920 --> 2:41:58.760]  but let's just get to this right now,
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:00.120]  trying to find my big stack.
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:02.600]  There's so much of it, I get confused.
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:04.600]  Here's some of the articles where they say
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:06.040]  Trump's gonna try to steal the election
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:08.200]  and Trump's gonna, again, they're gonna contest,
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:10.360]  they admit that, but if he contests their contention,
[2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:13.000]  that's illegal and so that's how the media
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:17.120]  is gonna represent this and the big news is, big tech
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:19.240]  has said they're going to block everybody,
[2:42:20.120 --> 2:42:22.320]  but they said down to hundreds of millions of users
[2:42:22.320 --> 2:42:24.240]  potentially, because they said in other countries too,
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:27.880]  people weigh in and they said, oh, if you give an opinion
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:29.760]  on Facebook, did I think Trump won,
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:32.480]  they're gonna suspend you or ban you.
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:34.720]  How is it waking up in the new Soviet Union?
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:39.400]  Meanwhile, General Milley says he will not arrest Trump
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:43.880]  for the Democrats, so they spin that, that's AP,
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:47.920]  I can't make this up, they say that the military
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:50.440]  wants to arrest Trump, that's the new articles out today.
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:53.480]  Look at this headline, what if Trump loses,
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:56.240]  but won't concede how a constitutional crisis
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:00.560]  can play out and this Yahoo News front page story,
[2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:03.160]  that's basically a reprint of Atlantic Monthly,
[2:43:03.160 --> 2:43:04.960]  they lay it out and if you're a TV viewer,
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:08.720]  you've never seen me highlight an article like this, have you?
[2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:12.760]  Because this is so important, this is everything.
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:14.760]  In fact, tomorrow I'm gonna come in here,
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:17.800]  two to four PM with a live transmission
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:20.760]  and get just into this information.
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:24.880]  And we only got 37 days tomorrow, every day counts,
[2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:28.200]  everybody you talk to counts, every email you send,
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:31.800]  every text message, every prayer counts.
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:35.320]  But look at this article, what if Trump loses,
[2:43:35.320 --> 2:43:38.840]  and won't concede how a constitutional crisis can play out
[2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:41.320]  and then they're acting like he caused the crisis
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:43.720]  when they created the mail-in ballots,
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:46.160]  they say they're gonna contest no matter what,
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:48.320]  they say they're gonna split the country apart,
[2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:50.120]  they've activated the race riots
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:52.040]  and then they say, Trump did it,
[2:43:52.040 --> 2:43:55.560]  we have to counter this folks, but that's what scares me,
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:43:57.160]  that's why I got really upset this morning,
[2:43:57.160 --> 2:44:00.360]  they called a bunch of Republicans and said,
[2:44:00.360 --> 2:44:02.840]  Trump says he's not gonna concede if he loses,
[2:44:02.840 --> 2:44:05.640]  well, obviously they go, well, we won't support that.
[2:44:05.640 --> 2:44:08.040]  But their definition is, when we contest,
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:11.280]  he needs to give up, or that's not him admitting
[2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:12.600]  he lost, two different things.
[2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:15.720]  If they're contesting, and there's evidence on both sides,
[2:44:16.680 --> 2:44:18.760]  then that's not Trump refusing to concede.
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:20.120]  But see, they get, Republicans just try
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:22.320]  to get brownie points going, well, I guess,
[2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:26.440]  then Trump's bad, Republicans say they won't back Trump,
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:27.880]  and when he contests election, I mean,
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:29.500]  that's all they're doing.
[2:44:29.500 --> 2:44:34.380]  But they call up, man, these 80-year-old lawyers,
[2:44:35.260 --> 2:44:39.100]  who just wanna go home and eat their soup
[2:44:39.100 --> 2:44:40.860]  and watch the NFL or whatever,
[2:44:40.860 --> 2:44:43.580]  and it's just, hey, guys, you're not,
[2:44:43.580 --> 2:44:47.980]  you inherited a big rich country, but warriors built it, son,
[2:44:47.980 --> 2:44:49.700]  and you just need to get out of the game
[2:44:49.700 --> 2:44:51.860]  if you're not ready to fight.
[2:44:51.860 --> 2:44:53.940]  I mean, it's just, it's pathetic.
[2:44:53.940 --> 2:44:56.420]  Seeing in, piss on seeing in.
[2:44:56.420 --> 2:44:58.740]  Don't bad-mouth the president for no reason,
[2:44:58.740 --> 2:45:01.500]  just as it makes you feel good, he pathetic worms.
[2:45:02.780 --> 2:45:03.620]  Listen, sorry.
[2:45:05.060 --> 2:45:07.780]  Has President Trump backs his army of attorneys,
[2:45:07.780 --> 2:45:09.500]  they had like 10 times the attorneys for Democrats
[2:45:09.500 --> 2:45:14.140]  they had met, has jaded background
[2:45:14.140 --> 2:45:16.100]  to undermine an election result
[2:45:16.100 --> 2:45:18.220]  that does not cast as a victor?
[2:45:19.540 --> 2:45:21.940]  Him as a victor, Republican lawmakers found themselves
[2:45:21.940 --> 2:45:24.180]  in the astonishing position Thursday,
[2:45:24.180 --> 2:45:26.180]  the fact to reassure Americans,
[2:45:26.180 --> 2:45:28.640]  there would be a peaceful transition of power
[2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:31.300]  so the Democrats are saying, we're gonna take over,
[2:45:31.300 --> 2:45:33.340]  we're gonna contest no matter what,
[2:45:33.340 --> 2:45:35.260]  then they call up Republicans and go,
[2:45:35.260 --> 2:45:37.740]  if Trump loses and won't step down, what do you do?
[2:45:37.740 --> 2:45:39.980]  It's like, if you get caught killing your neighbor,
[2:45:39.980 --> 2:45:40.820]  what will you do?
[2:45:40.820 --> 2:45:43.220]  It's hypothetical, they're the ones doing it,
[2:45:43.220 --> 2:45:44.860]  but they're probably, well, I won't support that
[2:45:44.860 --> 2:45:46.660]  if he doesn't, instead of saying,
[2:45:46.660 --> 2:45:48.100]  it's the Democrats that are openly saying
[2:45:48.100 --> 2:45:49.860]  they're gonna contest it, Trump hasn't done that,
[2:45:49.860 --> 2:45:52.100]  instead of saying the right thing, the real thing,
[2:45:52.100 --> 2:45:54.860]  they just go, oh, let me roll over and piss on myself,
[2:45:54.860 --> 2:45:59.000]  will you please pass me over, angel of death?
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:02.020]  And it's that cowardice, that limp,
[2:46:02.020 --> 2:46:04.580]  you know what behavior that destroys us,
[2:46:04.580 --> 2:46:07.340]  I hate these people, at least the enemy's evil
[2:46:07.340 --> 2:46:09.700]  and knows what they want, it's these candy-ass,
[2:46:09.700 --> 2:46:14.700]  sherry Republicans, man, that are the bane of our existence.
[2:46:16.580 --> 2:46:19.540]  The Republican-controlled Senate went so far
[2:46:19.540 --> 2:46:22.180]  as to pass a resolution saying as much,
[2:46:22.180 --> 2:46:25.140]  meanwhile, amid the furor of Trump's latest,
[2:46:25.140 --> 2:46:27.980]  most brazen remarks, it became clear
[2:46:27.980 --> 2:46:31.700]  that just how the constitutional crisis could play out,
[2:46:31.700 --> 2:46:35.500]  should the president be defeated
[2:46:35.500 --> 2:46:39.240]  and persuade his allies to join him
[2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:43.100]  in rejecting the vote tallies.
[2:46:43.100 --> 2:46:48.100]  Now let's translate that, CNN, MSNBC are gonna say,
[2:46:48.100 --> 2:46:53.020]  oh, two to one, it's Democrats, they're doing mail-ins,
[2:46:53.020 --> 2:46:55.580]  they claim in some study, so because there's this many
[2:46:55.580 --> 2:46:58.420]  that haven't been counted yet, that means Trump loses,
[2:46:58.420 --> 2:47:00.740]  and with that defeat, that they'll announce
[2:47:00.740 --> 2:47:03.660]  at about 11 at night, till I say this,
[2:47:03.660 --> 2:47:05.660]  they'll probably change it, but about 11 at night,
[2:47:05.660 --> 2:47:08.420]  they'll announce it, and then that creates the civil war
[2:47:08.420 --> 2:47:10.300]  out of that because their people will believe
[2:47:10.300 --> 2:47:12.060]  that he actually lost and they won,
[2:47:12.060 --> 2:47:13.300]  then they'll try to keep the balance
[2:47:13.300 --> 2:47:15.500]  of their jurisdictions to play games,
[2:47:15.500 --> 2:47:17.380]  to string it out, to break up the country,
[2:47:17.380 --> 2:47:18.660]  which the Chai comms want.
[2:47:19.660 --> 2:47:21.780]  So let's read that paragraph one more time.
[2:47:21.780 --> 2:47:23.700]  The Republican-controlled Senate went so far
[2:47:23.700 --> 2:47:26.020]  as to pass a resolution saying as much.
[2:47:26.020 --> 2:47:29.860]  Meanwhile, amid the furor over Trump's latest,
[2:47:29.860 --> 2:47:33.540]  most brazen remarks, it became clear just how
[2:47:33.540 --> 2:47:36.180]  the constitutional crisis could play out,
[2:47:36.180 --> 2:47:38.220]  should the president be defeated
[2:47:38.220 --> 2:47:41.060]  and persuade his allies to join him
[2:47:41.060 --> 2:47:42.940]  in rejecting the vote tallies.
[2:47:42.940 --> 2:47:46.900]  So if he doesn't concede, Democrats say they won't,
[2:47:46.900 --> 2:47:50.740]  if he does the same thing, he has stolen the election,
[2:47:50.740 --> 2:47:52.580]  he is a dictator, he is a bad guy.
[2:47:52.580 --> 2:47:55.980]  It's all, and it's in, I mean, I read 30 articles,
[2:47:55.980 --> 2:47:58.380]  I scanned over 30, I mean, it's all the same story,
[2:47:58.380 --> 2:48:00.740]  it's all over the news, they're doing it.
[2:48:00.740 --> 2:48:03.620]  So we're cruising towards this, they know he's winning,
[2:48:03.620 --> 2:48:05.780]  they even admit in their war game, well, he's gonna win,
[2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:07.980]  but we're gonna contest it, they're that arrogant
[2:48:07.980 --> 2:48:09.980]  because they have to stay in for the public.
[2:48:10.860 --> 2:48:12.660]  I don't have to stay in for you, I respect you,
[2:48:12.660 --> 2:48:14.300]  I believe in you, I think if you're presented
[2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:15.860]  with the facts, you want freedom.
[2:48:15.860 --> 2:48:17.860]  I think if you're black, I think if you're white,
[2:48:17.860 --> 2:48:19.660]  I think if you're whatever, you got red blood, man,
[2:48:19.660 --> 2:48:22.940]  I respect you, but I expect you to respect yourselves
[2:48:22.940 --> 2:48:25.100]  and get pissed about this, because we're not just gonna
[2:48:25.100 --> 2:48:27.260]  sit here on our hands while they set all this up
[2:48:27.260 --> 2:48:30.100]  38 days out, what are we gonna do about it?
[2:48:30.100 --> 2:48:32.260]  Whole lives are coming up, but I've got more to say,
[2:48:32.260 --> 2:48:33.100]  stay with us.
[2:48:35.500 --> 2:48:38.940]  I don't wanna be negative about the prospects
[2:48:38.940 --> 2:48:41.500]  of the election, but I need to be honest with everybody.
[2:48:41.500 --> 2:48:44.140]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers,
[2:48:44.140 --> 2:48:46.740]  Congress, Chinese, have come out and said
[2:48:46.740 --> 2:48:47.740]  they're gonna contest the election,
[2:48:47.740 --> 2:48:49.780]  they know that Trump's gonna win the landslide.
[2:48:49.780 --> 2:48:52.460]  And the destabilization that that's gonna cause
[2:48:52.460 --> 2:48:55.940]  is going to further destroy the markets and the economy.
[2:48:55.940 --> 2:48:58.220]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able
[2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:00.260]  to prove that he's won the election,
[2:49:00.260 --> 2:49:03.340]  the Democrats have said they're going to break away
[2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:06.580]  politically and culturally into the blue states
[2:49:06.580 --> 2:49:09.220]  and blue cities and basically use that
[2:49:09.220 --> 2:49:12.660]  as a pretext of sabotage, the republic even more.
[2:49:12.660 --> 2:49:16.100]  So, until this cancer is rooted out,
[2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:18.940]  until these criminals that work with foreign governments
[2:49:18.940 --> 2:49:21.220]  that are trying to basically destroy the country
[2:49:21.220 --> 2:49:25.100]  are punished and removed, it's just gonna continue to happen.
[2:49:25.100 --> 2:49:27.220]  And so that's the big problem here,
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:30.060]  is that we have a stemming, dug-in corruption
[2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:32.580]  by people that hate the country's very existence.
[2:49:35.580 --> 2:49:37.780]  Last week, Tucker Carlson came out and said,
[2:49:37.780 --> 2:49:40.660]  America is becoming the Soviet Union.
[2:49:40.660 --> 2:49:44.020]  In many ways, we're worse than the Soviet Union.
[2:49:44.020 --> 2:49:45.900]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech
[2:49:45.900 --> 2:49:48.620]  can do, surveilling and censoring us.
[2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:50.820]  And we're gonna get a lot worse than the Soviet Union
[2:49:50.820 --> 2:49:52.460]  when it comes to forced inoculations
[2:49:52.460 --> 2:49:54.420]  and the medical tyranny being rolled out
[2:49:54.420 --> 2:49:57.020]  by the United Nations now in control
[2:49:57.020 --> 2:49:59.260]  of what you can and can't say online.
[2:49:59.260 --> 2:50:00.540]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:50:00.540 --> 2:50:02.860]  America is fighting for its life.
[2:50:02.860 --> 2:50:05.220]  And the enemy's number one mission
[2:50:05.220 --> 2:50:06.580]  is to get Trump out of office
[2:50:06.580 --> 2:50:09.100]  and number two is to silence inforce
[2:50:09.100 --> 2:50:12.060]  because we understand just how diabolical they are,
[2:50:12.060 --> 2:50:14.860]  just how evil they are, and we won't miss words.
[2:50:14.860 --> 2:50:17.380]  We know who the globalist are, we've got their number,
[2:50:17.380 --> 2:50:18.540]  and we know how to beat them,
[2:50:18.540 --> 2:50:21.940]  and we cover it seven days a week live at InfoWars,
[2:50:21.940 --> 2:50:24.140]  and it's only because of your support.
[2:50:24.140 --> 2:50:26.220]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us,
[2:50:26.220 --> 2:50:27.460]  and take advantage of the sales
[2:50:27.460 --> 2:50:30.220]  and get great products at infowarstore.com now.
[2:50:30.220 --> 2:50:39.900]  The globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[2:50:39.900 --> 2:50:42.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:42.700 --> 2:50:45.260]  Still at home.
[2:50:59.340 --> 2:51:02.500]  You know, it's been great knowing Ron Paul.
[2:51:02.500 --> 2:51:05.260]  It's been great knowing Paul Watson,
[2:51:05.260 --> 2:51:06.380]  it's been great knowing Joe Rogan,
[2:51:06.380 --> 2:51:08.140]  it's been great knowing this crew.
[2:51:08.140 --> 2:51:10.340]  Even more than them talking about it every day.
[2:51:10.340 --> 2:51:14.220]  It's been great knowing my father and my mother and my children and my wife.
[2:51:14.740 --> 2:51:15.860]  It's been great knowing all of you.
[2:51:16.280 --> 2:51:17.660]  And I'm not saying bye to everybody.
[2:51:17.660 --> 2:51:20.060]  I'm just telling you, you never know when you're going to see people again.
[2:51:20.420 --> 2:51:22.620]  You might want to tell them how much you love them through time and space.
[2:51:22.940 --> 2:51:23.660]  Forge too late.
[2:51:25.780 --> 2:51:28.220]  Because the globalists come to end the human experience.
[2:51:29.020 --> 2:51:30.740]  They're afraid of what we're going to do at the next level.
[2:51:31.740 --> 2:51:34.180]  And, uh, I have seen the other side.
[2:51:34.180 --> 2:51:35.820]  I've limped it.
[2:51:36.940 --> 2:51:40.260]  It's, uh, like people that had brain damage and they hook them up with wires.
[2:51:40.260 --> 2:51:40.940]  They get sight.
[2:51:41.460 --> 2:51:42.540]  I don't really know what they're seeing.
[2:51:42.620 --> 2:51:44.780]  They've never had sight before, but they get a good idea.
[2:51:45.260 --> 2:51:46.460]  It's a big deal, folks.
[2:51:47.900 --> 2:51:49.500]  Paul Watson's about to take over.
[2:51:49.580 --> 2:51:53.180]  Um, let me just say this because the hotter the show, the more important
[2:51:53.180 --> 2:51:54.420]  the time is the less I plug.
[2:51:54.420 --> 2:51:57.580]  And I don't want to be up here like a baby bird begging for your money all day.
[2:51:57.620 --> 2:51:59.180]  I'm not funded by Soros.
[2:51:59.180 --> 2:52:00.340]  I'm not funded by Bill Gates.
[2:52:00.660 --> 2:52:01.820]  I don't have any big sponsors.
[2:52:01.820 --> 2:52:02.820]  I'm just funded by you.
[2:52:03.020 --> 2:52:05.220]  I've got great products, so you should really get them.
[2:52:06.340 --> 2:52:08.500]  And we've got, uh, preparewithalix.com.
[2:52:08.500 --> 2:52:10.980]  I went to my Patriot, the biggest, most successful, high-quality
[2:52:10.980 --> 2:52:13.620]  shrubble food company in the U S because they have good, high-quality
[2:52:13.620 --> 2:52:14.660]  food at a very low price.
[2:52:15.060 --> 2:52:18.220]  And I said, uh, you know, that they may shut down our bank accounts and
[2:52:18.220 --> 2:52:19.860]  shut down our shopping cart in the future.
[2:52:20.060 --> 2:52:23.540]  I used to get investors ready to go get the food from you to fund us.
[2:52:23.580 --> 2:52:25.660]  And I told them, you know, the things we're going through.
[2:52:26.260 --> 2:52:31.020]  And they said, well, boom, like a day later, they had preparewithalix.com
[2:52:31.540 --> 2:52:35.860]  with their highest quality food, their full spectrum of products discounted
[2:52:35.860 --> 2:52:38.620]  across the board when they can't even really use a discount.
[2:52:38.860 --> 2:52:40.540]  So they're selling it to me at cost.
[2:52:40.540 --> 2:52:43.140]  When you order this, I make some money from the operation.
[2:52:43.140 --> 2:52:43.860]  They make nothing.
[2:52:44.180 --> 2:52:45.580]  And I know they're margins.
[2:52:45.580 --> 2:52:48.140]  So preparewithalix will have to end on Monday.
[2:52:48.140 --> 2:52:49.340]  They extended it a few days.
[2:52:49.780 --> 2:52:52.660]  Preparewithalix.com, water filtration, air filtration, but really the
[2:52:52.660 --> 2:52:54.140]  storeable food, it's all there.
[2:52:54.500 --> 2:52:57.300]  Now the full selection of my Patriots at infoorstore.com.
[2:52:57.860 --> 2:53:01.100]  And I mean, they've got two years supply, one year, six months, three
[2:53:01.100 --> 2:53:01.740]  months, two months.
[2:53:01.740 --> 2:53:04.220]  They've got all sorts of preparedness stuff.
[2:53:04.220 --> 2:53:07.020]  It's at infoorstore.com and then we get funded that way.
[2:53:07.020 --> 2:53:09.780]  But on the particular items they've got discounted, they're not going to
[2:53:09.780 --> 2:53:12.340]  find a deal better than to preparewithalix.com.
[2:53:13.380 --> 2:53:17.260]  And separately, eight pack power stack is, I got it right here, I think.
[2:53:19.020 --> 2:53:21.620]  Thirteen pills, I guess you take eight.
[2:53:22.740 --> 2:53:26.540]  I don't know, seven in the morning and then six in the, uh, six in the evening.
[2:53:26.540 --> 2:53:27.860]  And it's just got everything in there.
[2:53:27.860 --> 2:53:30.660]  We can't even get this anymore because the COVID lockdown, because there's
[2:53:30.660 --> 2:53:32.180]  13 different formulas in here.
[2:53:32.180 --> 2:53:35.300]  So infoorstore.com, this is 60% off.
[2:53:35.300 --> 2:53:40.180]  That's right at cost and it is free shipping and you'll never be able
[2:53:40.180 --> 2:53:42.580]  to get it again because we can't reformulate it.
[2:53:42.580 --> 2:53:45.180]  We can't get these products with the breakdown and that's, that's how
[2:53:45.180 --> 2:53:49.180]  apocalyptic this is, you know, family calls up crew members when I'm
[2:53:49.180 --> 2:53:52.900]  saying, buy our t-shirts, buy our books, buy our stuff, maybe the last time.
[2:53:53.180 --> 2:53:56.900]  I mean, if Biden gets in, they're shutting the whole internet off for all
[2:53:56.900 --> 2:53:57.460]  conservatives.
[2:53:57.460 --> 2:53:58.780]  They have a database on you all.
[2:53:58.780 --> 2:54:02.860]  I led the show where the Democrats said, we're going to block all Republicans
[2:54:02.860 --> 2:54:07.180]  on election day because you're liars and they just restricted Tucker Carlson
[2:54:07.180 --> 2:54:07.580]  on Facebook.
[2:54:07.580 --> 2:54:10.060]  I mean, they got us used to the abuse.
[2:54:10.060 --> 2:54:12.620]  So I'm just telling you that it's bad.
[2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:14.380]  People, how are you doing?
[2:54:14.900 --> 2:54:17.860]  Folks, we're in the same nest together.
[2:54:18.180 --> 2:54:19.180]  We're in the same boat.
[2:54:19.500 --> 2:54:22.580]  So while you still can, 38 days out, they're ready to ship the
[2:54:22.580 --> 2:54:23.620]  storeable food right now.
[2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:24.860]  Other folks don't even have it.
[2:54:24.860 --> 2:54:29.420]  They're ready to ship you the eight pack power stat infowarstore.com and DNA
[2:54:29.420 --> 2:54:33.380]  force plus, even though it's going to sell out 60% off and free shipping.
[2:54:35.780 --> 2:54:41.420]  Ultra 12, amazing, winter, sun, amazing, all discounted infowarstore.com
[2:54:41.420 --> 2:54:46.540]  because we're selling everything so that we at least have money to operate
[2:54:47.100 --> 2:54:50.300]  sometime to the future and we'll stay here until they turn the lights out.
[2:54:50.860 --> 2:54:52.660]  But they're coming for the whole damn time.
[2:54:52.660 --> 2:54:54.980]  They're trying to turn America's lights out.
[2:54:55.980 --> 2:54:59.380]  So just pray for justice, pray for peace, pray for an awakening, pray for
[2:54:59.380 --> 2:55:03.340]  us to come together, all of us that have red blood under Jesus and realize this
[2:55:03.340 --> 2:55:04.540]  is a satanic attack.
[2:55:05.140 --> 2:55:05.780]  I clutch to God.
[2:55:05.780 --> 2:55:06.780]  I clutch to Jesus.
[2:55:06.780 --> 2:55:07.780]  This is real folks.
[2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:09.380]  This is all spiritual.
[2:55:09.380 --> 2:55:13.140]  I never really doubted it, but now I know it's all real and the enemy just
[2:55:13.140 --> 2:55:13.980]  wants us all alone.
[2:55:13.980 --> 2:55:15.620]  Let's come together with our love of God.
[2:55:15.900 --> 2:55:18.940]  No matter if you're in a nursing home or you're in the North Pole at a
[2:55:18.940 --> 2:55:22.740]  weather station or whether you're in Louisiana or whether you're in Mexico
[2:55:22.740 --> 2:55:26.260]  or whether you're in Germany or Japan or South Africa, you love God.
[2:55:26.260 --> 2:55:27.660]  You call your skin doesn't matter.
[2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:29.420]  We come together in our spirit.
[2:55:29.420 --> 2:55:31.340]  I love you all and I appreciate this crew.
[2:55:31.940 --> 2:55:33.540]  And I just tell you, this is the big time.
[2:55:33.540 --> 2:55:34.780]  This is the enemy takeover.
[2:55:34.780 --> 2:55:37.260]  This is the big AI market to be system.
[2:55:37.260 --> 2:55:39.660]  We've got to tell the truth and stand against it.
[2:55:39.660 --> 2:55:40.660]  All watching them.
[2:55:42.660 --> 2:55:47.420]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump and I were to
[2:55:47.420 --> 2:55:53.140]  call, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications of COVID-19, which are
[2:55:53.140 --> 2:56:00.100]  well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people
[2:56:00.100 --> 2:56:04.020]  will have died probably by the time I finish this talk.
[2:56:04.260 --> 2:56:08.420]  Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar, part of the establishment
[2:56:08.420 --> 2:56:09.740]  for close to 50 years.
[2:56:10.180 --> 2:56:16.100]  But now, boy, as his brain degenerates, we are seeing walking public
[2:56:16.100 --> 2:56:20.180]  dementia on the biggest stage of the world, the 2020 election.
[2:56:20.540 --> 2:56:23.300]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[2:56:23.540 --> 2:56:28.180]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population.
[2:56:28.260 --> 2:56:30.780]  We're not even one tenth of one percent have actually died.
[2:56:31.060 --> 2:56:35.380]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damage
[2:56:35.380 --> 2:56:39.180]  statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[2:56:39.500 --> 2:56:41.660]  How is anyone even putting up with this?
[2:56:41.660 --> 2:56:46.220]  It is beyond bizarre.
[2:56:46.220 --> 2:57:00.220]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto line.
[2:57:00.220 --> 2:57:02.060]  The desert is my brother.
[2:57:02.460 --> 2:57:04.420]  My skin is cracked and dry.
[2:57:04.860 --> 2:57:06.860]  I was riding on a phone call.
[2:57:07.260 --> 2:57:12.220]  And now the summit dot news hour with your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:57:12.660 --> 2:57:13.780]  And yes, Dr.
[2:57:13.780 --> 2:57:17.340]  Ron Paul confirms he's in the hospital, suffered some type of stroke.
[2:57:17.540 --> 2:57:19.140]  Well, he's live on air.
[2:57:19.140 --> 2:57:20.100]  The message from Dr.
[2:57:20.100 --> 2:57:21.900]  Ron Paul is I'm doing fine.
[2:57:21.900 --> 2:57:23.700]  Thank you all for your concern.
[2:57:23.700 --> 2:57:28.780]  And now summit dot news host, Paul Joseph Watson, live from London, England.
[2:57:30.980 --> 2:57:31.660]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:57:31.660 --> 2:57:36.780]  Yeah, we're still tracking the thankful recovery of former congressman
[2:57:36.780 --> 2:57:41.100]  Ron Paul, 85 years old, who, of course, many of you probably seen by now
[2:57:41.100 --> 2:57:44.860]  the chilling video where he appeared to suffer a stroke on camera
[2:57:45.300 --> 2:57:47.980]  during a live stream of his Liberty report.
[2:57:48.820 --> 2:57:52.620]  Of course, there are different types of stroke, some less serious than others.
[2:57:52.620 --> 2:57:53.820]  Thank the Lord.
[2:57:53.820 --> 2:57:57.620]  It appears as if Ron Paul has suffered a less serious situation.
[2:57:58.340 --> 2:58:01.300]  He was rushed to hospital as a precautionary measure.
[2:58:02.100 --> 2:58:05.700]  And as Alex just said, he just sent out a tweet 10 minutes ago, saying
[2:58:05.700 --> 2:58:06.420]  he's doing fine.
[2:58:06.420 --> 2:58:08.260]  Thanks for your concern.
[2:58:08.260 --> 2:58:12.260]  His son, Senator Rand Paul, was also sent out tweets saying, thank God,
[2:58:12.300 --> 2:58:14.100]  dad is doing well.
[2:58:14.100 --> 2:58:16.580]  Thank you for all your prayers today.
[2:58:16.700 --> 2:58:19.780]  Of course, that hasn't stopped leftists on Twitter
[2:58:20.180 --> 2:58:24.060]  celebrating the fact that Ron Paul had a stroke live on air.
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:26.340]  And I knew this would happen.
[2:58:26.340 --> 2:58:29.620]  And the reason why I knew it would happen is because for the past
[2:58:29.620 --> 2:58:34.220]  what is it now, three years plus, they've repeatedly celebrated the fact
[2:58:34.220 --> 2:58:39.220]  that Rand Paul's neighbor viciously attacked him during a sneak attack
[2:58:39.220 --> 2:58:44.020]  when he was doing his gardening from behind led to Rand Paul being
[2:58:44.020 --> 2:58:47.260]  seriously ill for the lion's share of the year.
[2:58:47.620 --> 2:58:49.940]  He had to have part of his lung removed.
[2:58:50.540 --> 2:58:56.020]  And whenever Rand Paul trends on Twitter, whenever Rand Paul is in the spotlight,
[2:58:56.620 --> 2:58:59.620]  every single response below the tweet is, oh,
[2:59:00.540 --> 2:59:02.940]  isn't it a shame that Rand Paul's neighbor isn't around?
[2:59:02.940 --> 2:59:04.500]  And guess what?
[2:59:04.500 --> 2:59:07.660]  That is the first response that I'm seeing right now
[2:59:08.580 --> 2:59:13.980]  to Senator Rand Paul's tweet, having just suffered his watching his dad
[2:59:13.980 --> 2:59:16.100]  have a stroke on live stream.
[2:59:16.860 --> 2:59:19.700]  So Senator Rand Paul tweets that his dad is doing well.
[2:59:20.140 --> 2:59:25.140]  And the first response below it is, quote, Rand Paul has a great neighbor.
[2:59:26.020 --> 2:59:30.540]  These are the same kind of people who say it's desecrating the memory
[2:59:30.540 --> 2:59:35.020]  of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to even nominate a Supreme Court justice
[2:59:35.380 --> 2:59:37.020]  before the 2020 election.
[2:59:37.460 --> 2:59:39.340]  Oh, they're the nice people.
[2:59:39.740 --> 2:59:42.340]  They're the hashtag be kind people.
[2:59:43.140 --> 2:59:48.100]  As soon as anyone gets in any kind of medical situation or is attacked on the
[2:59:48.100 --> 2:59:50.060]  right, of course, they go straight in.
[2:59:50.700 --> 2:59:56.460]  By the way, I'm not sure if this has been deleted yet, but a leftist,
[2:59:56.460 --> 3:00:01.220]  apparently Biden, supported by the looks of it, who is verified on Twitter
[3:00:01.620 --> 3:00:04.380]  with 150,000 followers.
[3:00:05.180 --> 3:00:07.340]  And I quote, we did this.
[3:00:07.340 --> 3:00:10.740]  So it should still be up there if they haven't deleted it yet.
[3:00:11.220 --> 3:00:13.660]  And of course, this person doesn't identify themselves.
[3:00:13.660 --> 3:00:16.900]  I don't even know if it's the person in the profile picture.
[3:00:17.900 --> 3:00:23.180]  But here's the tweet that was sent out probably an hour after Rand Paul,
[3:00:23.180 --> 3:00:26.580]  Rand Paul, Ron Paul, sorry, suffered that stroke live on the stream.
[3:00:26.580 --> 3:00:33.900]  Quote, this is a leftist Democrat, a verified Twitter account with 150,000
[3:00:33.900 --> 3:00:39.100]  followers. Quote, I am not a religious man, but please, Lord, send your best
[3:00:39.100 --> 3:00:42.740]  angels to Ron Paul to quickly send his nasty ass to hell.
[3:00:42.980 --> 3:00:43.660]  Amen.
[3:00:44.500 --> 3:00:49.140]  That's how that Biden Democrat supporter chose to respond to that
[3:00:49.140 --> 3:00:53.420]  horrific footage of Ron Paul suffering a stroke, apparently suffering a stroke
[3:00:53.620 --> 3:00:56.060]  live on stream. These are the nice people.
[3:00:56.060 --> 3:00:59.340]  These are the people who say anyone on the right, conservatives,
[3:00:59.340 --> 3:01:03.980]  Republicans are inherently hateful for their beliefs, the kind of people
[3:01:04.140 --> 3:01:10.500]  who within an hour of a widely respected, widely loved, even on some
[3:01:10.500 --> 3:01:13.980]  areas of the left, of course, the libertarian left, one of the most
[3:01:13.980 --> 3:01:18.540]  honest, decent persons in politics in the history of the United States,
[3:01:18.540 --> 3:01:21.660]  Ron Paul, that's what they choose to respond with.
[3:01:23.380 --> 3:01:25.740]  How edgy, how edgy indeed.
[3:01:25.980 --> 3:01:26.940]  But that's not all.
[3:01:26.940 --> 3:01:31.660]  I went through some of the responses to this tweet and I'm not even
[3:01:31.660 --> 3:01:32.780]  going to read some of them.
[3:01:32.780 --> 3:01:34.460]  In fact, I'm not going to read any of them.
[3:01:34.460 --> 3:01:37.660]  I was going to read them, but no, they don't deserve the attention.
[3:01:38.180 --> 3:01:42.540]  But it's literally them just making jokes and celebrating about Ron Paul
[3:01:42.540 --> 3:01:43.340]  having a stroke.
[3:01:43.580 --> 3:01:45.740]  These are the hashtag be kind people.
[3:01:45.740 --> 3:01:50.220]  These are the people who say, you're the bad guy holding certain opinion,
[3:01:50.220 --> 3:01:54.620]  opinions that you're inherently evil and that there's no recourse and
[3:01:54.620 --> 3:01:58.540]  that you deserve no respect, no open platform to even have an opinion,
[3:01:58.780 --> 3:02:03.660]  because they're so good, so tolerant, so loving.
[3:02:03.660 --> 3:02:07.740]  And these are the people now celebrating Ron Paul's stroke.
[3:02:07.740 --> 3:02:12.180]  Well, they'll be disappointed to hear that apparently he's already on the
[3:02:12.180 --> 3:02:13.980]  mend and thank God for that.
[3:02:13.980 --> 3:02:16.860]  We're going to get into the coronavirus news now because, of course, we have a
[3:02:16.860 --> 3:02:22.940]  situation in the United Kingdom where the Prime Minister, who was supposedly a
[3:02:22.940 --> 3:02:27.580]  libertarian back in the day, has been completely railroaded, completely crushed
[3:02:27.580 --> 3:02:33.740]  into complete submission by hysterical advisors and scientific experts.
[3:02:35.180 --> 3:02:38.940]  And even though the coronavirus hospitalizations, as they are in many
[3:02:38.940 --> 3:02:42.620]  of the European countries, even as they are in the United Kingdom,
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:50.700]  even as the deaths are flatlined completely, the measures to deal with this
[3:02:50.700 --> 3:02:55.580]  are getting even more draconian, headlined from Summit News.
[3:02:56.780 --> 3:03:02.300]  Pub Starzy, UK Rent-A-Mob patrol streets to check if bars are open.
[3:03:03.260 --> 3:03:06.540]  Now, cast your mind back to the first lockdown when we literally had
[3:03:06.540 --> 3:03:14.460]  police officers inspecting people shopping bags to see if they bought a bottle of wine.
[3:03:14.460 --> 3:03:18.220]  Oh, by the way, some of them are now calling to ban alcohol.
[3:03:19.020 --> 3:03:23.420]  That's literally one of the only ways that some of these people who have been
[3:03:23.420 --> 3:03:27.500]  completely cut off from society, completely isolated from their friends,
[3:03:27.500 --> 3:03:29.900]  they dealt with it by drinking more alcohol.
[3:03:29.900 --> 3:03:31.260]  And yeah, that's not a good thing.
[3:03:31.260 --> 3:03:33.580]  But now they want to take that away as well.
[3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:38.460]  So they were inspecting our shopping bags back in April, as they see from the video now.
[3:03:38.460 --> 3:03:45.500]  They're arresting people on the street for not wearing a mask in Starbucks,
[3:03:45.500 --> 3:03:49.820]  because this guy that you're seeing now had an argument with a Starbucks employee,
[3:03:49.820 --> 3:03:53.260]  and then they called the police on him, the police arrested him.
[3:03:53.260 --> 3:03:57.900]  Three of them required, by the way, to arrest one 72-year-old man.
[3:03:57.900 --> 3:03:59.820]  Very brave, very brave.
[3:03:59.820 --> 3:04:03.340]  And of course, he made the point in this video, where were you during the BLM protests?
[3:04:03.340 --> 3:04:08.220]  Well, many of them were kneeling, weren't they, as tens of thousands of people,
[3:04:08.220 --> 3:04:13.180]  not social distancing rampaged through London and other cities.
[3:04:14.460 --> 3:04:20.460]  But if it wasn't bad enough that we now can't even meet more than six people at a time,
[3:04:20.460 --> 3:04:26.380]  if it wasn't bad enough that in places like Scotland and universities across the country,
[3:04:26.380 --> 3:04:30.300]  which I'm going to get into, they're literally being treated like prisoners
[3:04:30.300 --> 3:04:36.300]  with wardens watching them eat, patrolling up and down the cafeteria,
[3:04:36.300 --> 3:04:40.300]  as they're forced to eat alone, exam-style desks.
[3:04:41.020 --> 3:04:45.100]  And if they try to get up to get a glass of water, they're severely reprimanded
[3:04:45.100 --> 3:04:48.860]  and told they're going to be suspended, as if all that wasn't bad enough.
[3:04:48.860 --> 3:04:51.900]  We now have minimum wage,
[3:04:51.900 --> 3:05:00.300]  rent-a-mob city inspector COVID enforcers, peaking through people's letterboxes,
[3:05:00.300 --> 3:05:06.380]  peering through windows to check if people are not social distancing,
[3:05:06.380 --> 3:05:11.020]  to check if people are gathering in groups of, God forbid, more than six.
[3:05:11.020 --> 3:05:14.300]  Maybe if you just call it a BLM rally, then they'll not only go away,
[3:05:14.300 --> 3:05:15.580]  they'll kneel and bow down.
[3:05:16.780 --> 3:05:19.580]  Images posted to the media,
[3:05:19.580 --> 3:05:26.620]  images posted to Twitter show COVID enforcers in London patrolling the streets,
[3:05:26.620 --> 3:05:31.100]  peering into windows and letterboxes to ensure pubs and clubs are closed
[3:05:31.100 --> 3:05:34.380]  as part of the government draconian new coronavirus curfew.
[3:05:35.340 --> 3:05:38.780]  Now, you know for a fact that these people get off on this.
[3:05:38.780 --> 3:05:43.900]  Now, let's be fair, there are a lot of people in minimum wage, low paying jobs,
[3:05:43.900 --> 3:05:48.860]  who don't give a flying F about any of these coronavirus regulations
[3:05:48.860 --> 3:05:51.500]  and won't aggressively enforce them on anyone else
[3:05:52.140 --> 3:05:55.500]  because they realize that it's complete hysteria.
[3:05:55.500 --> 3:06:01.980]  But there are many people who have crappy lives, shitty relationships,
[3:06:01.980 --> 3:06:05.660]  they don't have close relationships with anyone because they're intolerable,
[3:06:05.660 --> 3:06:10.380]  in many cases, they have these low paying jobs which they're not satisfied with,
[3:06:10.380 --> 3:06:17.180]  they hate their lives, they hate themselves, and now they get to be in control.
[3:06:17.180 --> 3:06:19.900]  Potentially, for the first time ever in their lives,
[3:06:19.900 --> 3:06:25.500]  they get to exercise power and petty authority over everyone else,
[3:06:25.500 --> 3:06:27.900]  and boy are some of them milking it.
[3:06:29.100 --> 3:06:31.020]  We're going to get more into that after the break.
[3:06:31.740 --> 3:06:33.420]  We're also going to get into Uber now,
[3:06:33.420 --> 3:06:36.780]  saying that you're going to have to take a selfie within the Uber app
[3:06:36.780 --> 3:06:39.100]  to prove you're not a mass refuse me.
[3:06:39.100 --> 3:06:41.740]  Absolutely incredible dystopia.
[3:06:41.740 --> 3:06:43.500]  Don't go away, some of it don't use, we'll be right.
[3:06:43.500 --> 3:06:49.420]  The Renaissance, the Great Enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced by
[3:06:50.540 --> 3:06:57.100]  scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law
[3:06:58.300 --> 3:07:04.620]  where the technocrats are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable
[3:07:04.620 --> 3:07:09.900]  as a cow. In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[3:07:09.900 --> 3:07:16.300]  That is the post-human extremist plan, that is the public ideology of the globalist,
[3:07:17.180 --> 3:07:23.660]  and everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds
[3:07:23.660 --> 3:07:30.140]  as we're slowly killed, and any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's
[3:07:30.140 --> 3:07:33.820]  wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[3:07:33.820 --> 3:07:41.740]  This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[3:07:41.740 --> 3:07:43.580]  This is the essence of evil.
[3:07:43.580 --> 3:07:48.060]  I've come to you many times and asked for your support and you've always come through
[3:07:48.700 --> 3:07:52.700]  and Info Wars has come through. We've never sold out, we've never backed down,
[3:07:52.700 --> 3:07:59.420]  we've always told the truth, we've made mistakes, but 98% of the time or so we're dead on
[3:07:59.420 --> 3:08:04.780]  and the enemy knows that. Info Wars is a thought leader, not just here but around the world,
[3:08:04.780 --> 3:08:09.340]  and that's why the Chai comms, Hollywood, the globalist want us off the air,
[3:08:09.340 --> 3:08:14.780]  because their global plan of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on
[3:08:14.780 --> 3:08:19.980]  air. If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now they're going to shut Info Wars down and shut
[3:08:19.980 --> 3:08:25.340]  everybody else down as well. You already know that, it's out of the open, so again, count the cost,
[3:08:25.340 --> 3:08:30.220]  focus and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth, spreading the word that
[3:08:30.220 --> 3:08:34.380]  overrides the censors, your financial support, getting the products at InfoWars.com and your
[3:08:34.380 --> 3:08:39.180]  prayer. I'm praying for you, please pray for us, let's do this together. We're going to win,
[3:08:39.180 --> 3:08:42.700]  we are winning, but it's not going to be easy. The enemy's trying to take it all from us, let's not
[3:08:42.700 --> 3:09:00.460]  let them succeed. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Transmitting worldwide from the summit.new
[3:09:00.460 --> 3:09:06.140]  studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:09:06.140 --> 3:09:15.180]  We'll talk about Joe Rogan a little bit later as well, of course. What is he now about? Three
[3:09:15.180 --> 3:09:21.180]  weeks into his Spotify deal and they're talking about a mutiny in the New York office. They're
[3:09:21.180 --> 3:09:27.740]  talking about editing his podcast, going in after the fact and fact checking them.
[3:09:29.020 --> 3:09:34.940]  I mean, and this is only three weeks in. This is incredible. I mean, did he really expect there
[3:09:34.940 --> 3:09:41.020]  would be no strings attached to a hundred million dollar contract? Incredible. We're going to get
[3:09:41.020 --> 3:09:45.340]  into that later though, because I'm talking about coronavirus. I'm talking about how the UK
[3:09:46.140 --> 3:09:51.500]  was basically being turned into a Stasi state. And again, the point I make over and over again is
[3:09:52.300 --> 3:09:57.900]  there aren't enough police to enforce this tyranny. There are 60 million people in the UK,
[3:09:57.900 --> 3:10:04.540]  not enough police, which is why as in the Stasi's Germany, they had one informant,
[3:10:04.540 --> 3:10:09.580]  one spy for every seven people in the population. That's what they're going for now,
[3:10:09.580 --> 3:10:15.900]  not only through these city inspectors, but literally opening people's letterboxes and
[3:10:15.900 --> 3:10:21.740]  peering through, but also through the rest of the population, encouraging them to spy on
[3:10:21.740 --> 3:10:27.340]  their neighbors if they gather in groups of more than six. Now, again, in the majority of cases,
[3:10:27.340 --> 3:10:32.940]  people aren't going to do that because they're not complete dicks. But in some cases, they are
[3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:38.700]  going to do it not because they're genuinely concerned about COVID in every case. Some of them
[3:10:38.700 --> 3:10:43.500]  will do it for that reason because they've been completely anaesthetized to reality
[3:10:44.380 --> 3:10:50.220]  by this relentless hysteria to the point to which polls show that on average,
[3:10:50.220 --> 3:10:57.500]  Brits think five million people in the UK have died from coronavirus. It's actually less than 50,000,
[3:10:57.500 --> 3:11:02.460]  but because the constant drumbeat of media scaremongering, they literally believe the
[3:11:02.460 --> 3:11:08.940]  true numbers are 100 times higher, some of them will report their neighbors because they really
[3:11:08.940 --> 3:11:14.140]  think that they're helping. And again, because they have meaningless pathetic lives and that gives
[3:11:14.140 --> 3:11:21.180]  them some importance. But I would say the majority of cases, people are going to report their neighbors
[3:11:21.180 --> 3:11:27.980]  because they hate their neighbors. And again, that goes back to how the strands of society,
[3:11:27.980 --> 3:11:34.540]  the threads of society have been completely ripped apart by modernity, by this idea that
[3:11:34.540 --> 3:11:38.220]  you shouldn't talk to your neighbors and that talking to your neighbors is weird.
[3:11:38.220 --> 3:11:45.740]  Like, I will literally walk past my neighbors in London on the stairs in the apartment building,
[3:11:45.740 --> 3:11:52.860]  say hello, and they'll look like they've just been confronted by, I don't know, the Loch Ness
[3:11:52.860 --> 3:12:01.980]  Monster or something. Maybe they know who I am. But that is a reason for why many people
[3:12:01.980 --> 3:12:06.380]  report their neighbors for alleged coronavirus violations because they have grudges against
[3:12:06.380 --> 3:12:11.900]  their neighbors because last summer, maybe their neighbors had allowed parties, maybe they weren't
[3:12:11.900 --> 3:12:18.060]  invited to these parties, maybe they were annoyed by the noise and now it's payback.
[3:12:19.020 --> 3:12:24.940]  And they don't have enough employees or goons, city inspectors to carry this through. So they're
[3:12:24.940 --> 3:12:31.180]  going to have to hire via proxy the rest of the population. And as I speculate in this article,
[3:12:31.180 --> 3:12:37.020]  pubs, stars, the UK, rent them on patrol streets to check if bars are open. If this progresses in
[3:12:37.020 --> 3:12:42.780]  the direction it's going, they're going to start offering financial benefits and maybe
[3:12:42.780 --> 3:12:50.060]  welfare reductions, maybe vouchers, maybe credits, maybe discounts on cancel tax bills,
[3:12:50.060 --> 3:12:57.740]  property taxes, for people who report their own neighbors. That's going to be the next step. But
[3:12:57.740 --> 3:13:04.940]  as of right now, as of last night, in fact, pubs and restaurants were required to close at 10pm.
[3:13:05.660 --> 3:13:12.780]  They've literally set a 10pm curfew. Again, apparently the coronavirus goes to bed at 10pm
[3:13:12.780 --> 3:13:19.180]  and stops infecting people. Now, if you know the British, you know the British like to drink and
[3:13:19.180 --> 3:13:24.620]  you know the British like to binge drink. So what do you think they're going to do? They're going to
[3:13:24.620 --> 3:13:30.300]  go to the pub earlier in the same number of groups. They're going to drink as much as they can until
[3:13:30.300 --> 3:13:35.980]  10pm. They're going to get kicked out at 10pm. They're going to go to each other's houses and
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:43.340]  continue to drink all night in large groups of people, which I guess is why you need the goons
[3:13:43.340 --> 3:13:49.500]  out peeking through their letterboxes. So now newly empowered marshals and environmental health
[3:13:49.500 --> 3:13:54.780]  officers have been empowered to roam the streets looking for people violating social distancing
[3:13:54.780 --> 3:14:00.780]  rules. Dan Barker tweeted, strange sight, city inspectors working through SoHo looking for
[3:14:00.780 --> 3:14:08.540]  illegal speak easies. That basically means like secret clubs that open after everywhere else is
[3:14:08.540 --> 3:14:14.940]  short. And this is in SoHo London and you can look at the images. And again, one guy's peeking
[3:14:14.940 --> 3:14:23.900]  through a letterbox, other people appearing through windows. It's all gone very east, Germany, 1960s.
[3:14:25.260 --> 3:14:29.340]  The government has introduced the measures off the back of media scaremongering about rising
[3:14:29.340 --> 3:14:33.580]  coronavirus cases, despite the fact that deaths and hospitalisations have flatlined at numerous
[3:14:33.580 --> 3:14:37.900]  warnings that the massive increase in testing is producing an overwhelming number of false
[3:14:37.900 --> 3:14:43.020]  positives. The experts are saying the experts are actually truthful and honest and have any
[3:14:43.020 --> 3:14:48.380]  ounce of integrity who haven't nailed their colours to the mast of this hysteria from the start,
[3:14:48.380 --> 3:14:58.780]  saying that 91% of these coronavirus tests, which are coming back positive, are false positives. We
[3:14:58.780 --> 3:15:06.540]  know that they tested through, they literally tested pieces of fruit in Tanzania for coronavirus,
[3:15:06.540 --> 3:15:13.580]  and they came back positive. But despite all these positive, supposedly positive, coronavirus
[3:15:13.580 --> 3:15:19.660]  cases, well, guess what? The hospitals are still empty. Maybe we'll get some more TikTok dancers
[3:15:19.660 --> 3:15:26.940]  soon. They just shut down a new hospital, one of these overspilled Nightingale hospitals in
[3:15:26.940 --> 3:15:32.140]  Scotland. They shut down the hospital that was built to deal with the overspill of coronavirus
[3:15:32.140 --> 3:15:38.220]  cases, and yet now we're being told there's a second wave. There's no second wave. Look at the
[3:15:38.220 --> 3:15:44.620]  graph. I tweeted this earlier. You have a graph here of daily COVID-19 tests per thousand people.
[3:15:44.620 --> 3:15:51.900]  You go back to the beginning of April. The graph rises almost exponentially. Now you arrive at the
[3:15:51.900 --> 3:15:59.100]  end of September. The number of people being tested is, I think the numbers were, I think it was
[3:15:59.100 --> 3:16:04.700]  100 times more tests being performed now. That was the number from April compared to September,
[3:16:04.700 --> 3:16:10.940]  I believe. There are 100 times more tests being performed. Then you look at the share of COVID-19
[3:16:10.940 --> 3:16:19.020]  tests, which is the next graph that are positive. April, it was 30% now at the end of September.
[3:16:19.020 --> 3:16:25.900]  Again, there's a tiny incline. There's a tiny incline in cases that are positive. But again,
[3:16:25.900 --> 3:16:35.260]  91% of them are false positives. You think that a nuclear coronavirus bomb, a dirty biological
[3:16:35.260 --> 3:16:41.020]  weapons bomb had exploded in every major city in the United Kingdom, given the way the media is
[3:16:41.020 --> 3:16:47.980]  treating this tiny incline in COVID-19 tests. Then you look at the deaths. You look at the
[3:16:47.980 --> 3:16:55.980]  hospitalizations. It's disappeared. The thing has almost disappeared. And yet now the draconian
[3:16:55.980 --> 3:17:01.820]  measures are becoming even more intense. Boris Johnson says, this is going to be six months,
[3:17:01.820 --> 3:17:07.900]  Christmas is canceled, New Year's is canceled. The virus has basically disappeared. Are any of
[3:17:07.900 --> 3:17:13.740]  them connected with reality? Do any of them see these graphs? Again, this is a supposedly
[3:17:13.740 --> 3:17:20.620]  conservative government elected to take the rights of the people, elected in the face of a
[3:17:21.580 --> 3:17:27.100]  socialist dictatorship that we were facing with Jeremy Corbyn. He's done worse than Jeremy Corbyn
[3:17:27.100 --> 3:17:33.180]  would ever have done. And it's absolutely abysmal, the way that people are being treated, the way
[3:17:33.180 --> 3:17:38.940]  the hospitality industry, which is already on its knees, is now being basically extinguished
[3:17:38.940 --> 3:17:45.020]  all together. We'll come back to talk about. Remember the global lock-mounger witnessing
[3:17:45.020 --> 3:17:51.020]  the Black Lives Matter, anti-for-riots, and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly
[3:17:51.020 --> 3:17:57.740]  directed by a handful of top billionaires, led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos,
[3:17:57.740 --> 3:18:04.860]  of course, Tim Cook, and others. They set up there with their trillions of dollars they control
[3:18:04.860 --> 3:18:09.260]  in their companies, and they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that
[3:18:09.260 --> 3:18:14.860]  against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local government and police.
[3:18:15.580 --> 3:18:19.580]  And the mayors are, again, they're playing their political game to try to trigger
[3:18:19.580 --> 3:18:23.500]  the complete breakdown of the United States and Western Europe, show these
[3:18:23.500 --> 3:18:28.140]  billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar. That's why I'm so angry
[3:18:28.140 --> 3:18:31.340]  that these globalists, because when you're looking at them, they're the ones that sit in their
[3:18:31.340 --> 3:18:37.420]  councils and have decided to run these plans against us. They are enemies of humanity and must
[3:18:37.420 --> 3:18:45.260]  be dealt with. It's us or them, period. In the area, during the pandemic, we looked to local
[3:18:45.260 --> 3:18:51.180]  health authorities, so for example, in the U.S., it would be CDC, for guidelines around medical
[3:18:51.180 --> 3:18:56.620]  misinformation in a narrow way which could cause harm in the real world. That was a few months ago
[3:18:56.620 --> 3:19:01.980]  when the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai made a very important statement. All the other big tech heads
[3:19:01.980 --> 3:19:06.460]  made the exact same statement because it comes out of the U.N. that they follow the guidance of the
[3:19:06.460 --> 3:19:12.380]  WHO and or local government. What they mean is, in the United States, other areas of the world,
[3:19:12.380 --> 3:19:17.100]  cities that have been unionized or that have actually signed on to U.N. memorandums and agreements.
[3:19:17.100 --> 3:19:20.620]  So what he's saying is, oh, we follow the United Nations and our global government,
[3:19:20.620 --> 3:19:24.620]  and then we've got little stakeholder parents, that's how the U.N. works,
[3:19:24.620 --> 3:19:29.260]  that then give the illusion of it being local. But then when your doctors or your scientists,
[3:19:29.260 --> 3:19:34.380]  your virologists, come out and say that COVID-19 has massively exaggerated the power grab,
[3:19:34.380 --> 3:19:39.580]  they get silenced. Their press conferences get muzzled, just like they do in communist China.
[3:19:39.580 --> 3:19:44.540]  That's what's really going on here. If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that
[3:19:44.540 --> 3:19:49.580]  finance and control them, to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth
[3:19:49.580 --> 3:19:53.900]  and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park,
[3:19:53.900 --> 3:19:58.540]  they have to look at us, the common people, they have to look at the proletariat, they have to look
[3:19:58.540 --> 3:20:04.140]  at the scum. That's why they love the lockdown, putting muzzles on us, that gives them a big thrill,
[3:20:04.140 --> 3:20:09.740]  controlling where we can go, what we can do, bankrupting Main Street, bankrupting small towns.
[3:20:09.740 --> 3:20:15.260]  All of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our total
[3:20:15.260 --> 3:20:21.980]  surrender, which is taking sterilant vaccines day one. Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over,
[3:20:21.980 --> 3:20:26.460]  playtime's over, they used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance,
[3:20:26.460 --> 3:20:31.740]  and now the spider's moving in for the kill. You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open,
[3:20:31.740 --> 3:20:35.660]  the question is, what are we going to do about it? Well, the first thing is identify the enemy,
[3:20:35.660 --> 3:20:53.740]  identify the enemy, identify the enemy, identify your enemy now. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:53.740 --> 3:20:59.180]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:59.180 --> 3:21:09.340]  This whole mask wearing phase, this moral panic has nothing to do with safety,
[3:21:09.340 --> 3:21:14.860]  has nothing to do with preventing the pandemic, stopping the pandemic, adds everything to do
[3:21:14.860 --> 3:21:20.860]  with control. As Noel Gallagher said last week, apparently, you know, if the coronavirus sees
[3:21:20.860 --> 3:21:25.260]  that you're eating a sandwich, it says, oh no, he's having his lunch, I'll avoid him.
[3:21:25.260 --> 3:21:32.940]  I was in a restaurant a couple of nights ago, and again, as soon as this is in Spain, as soon as you
[3:21:32.940 --> 3:21:37.180]  sit down in the restaurant, then you're allowed to take your mask off, because apparently again,
[3:21:37.180 --> 3:21:42.380]  the virus sees that you're looking at the menu, preparing to order and just kind of deviate around
[3:21:42.380 --> 3:21:49.820]  you and go to the next available person who isn't about to eat. I go outside later on in the evening,
[3:21:49.820 --> 3:21:56.620]  walk literally about, I don't know, 10 yards to the exit of the building, go outside, have a cigarette,
[3:21:57.180 --> 3:22:04.700]  come back in without the mask, get lectured for not wearing the mask from the space of the doorway
[3:22:04.700 --> 3:22:09.180]  to the table, which again, is probably less than 10 yards. It's probably about eight yards.
[3:22:10.140 --> 3:22:15.340]  So again, that was the opportunity, apparently, for the coronavirus, because it knows when you
[3:22:15.340 --> 3:22:21.580]  remove the mask to attack you. It knew that I'd remove the mask in that eight yard gap
[3:22:21.580 --> 3:22:26.780]  between the front door of the restaurant and the table. And that's when it probably took
[3:22:26.780 --> 3:22:32.300]  it opportunity, it's opportunity to attack. So I'm a goner at this point. But again,
[3:22:33.420 --> 3:22:38.460]  it's not about preventing stopping a pandemic, it's about control. You know what they do at
[3:22:38.460 --> 3:22:46.540]  Disney World? Now you have to eat, right? You have to be able to eat. So the enforcers, and they've
[3:22:46.540 --> 3:22:53.500]  hired a new cadre of COVID inspectors at Disney World, Paris, probably the same in the United
[3:22:53.500 --> 3:22:59.260]  States. If Disney World still even open in the United States, I don't know. But they've got the
[3:22:59.260 --> 3:23:05.580]  Disney World staff enforcing all this, then they've hired a new level, a new cadre, a new mob of
[3:23:05.580 --> 3:23:12.300]  COVID enforcers. And the rule is you can eat because the people have to eat without the mask,
[3:23:12.300 --> 3:23:18.940]  obviously. But you have to wear the mask while you're eating on your chin. Because again,
[3:23:19.740 --> 3:23:28.940]  the COVID virus is transient. It's prescient, I mean, and it knows that if you have the mask on
[3:23:28.940 --> 3:23:34.380]  your chin, and you can, in a millisecond, whip that mask up over your mouth and nose,
[3:23:34.380 --> 3:23:39.260]  then you're going to win the battle between yourself and the virus. So again, another completely
[3:23:39.260 --> 3:23:45.820]  cogent, sensible policy Disney World, while you're eating, you have to wear the mask on your chin.
[3:23:48.620 --> 3:23:53.100]  It's about control. It's about stripping you of human dignity. It's always been the same. And when
[3:23:53.100 --> 3:23:57.260]  they get the vaccine out, not only are you not going to be allowed to travel aboard a plane,
[3:23:57.260 --> 3:24:05.020]  you're not going to be allowed to use a taxi. And we're already seeing that with Uber headline.
[3:24:06.060 --> 3:24:12.700]  Uber demands refuse nicks, take mask selfies before they're allowed to use service. Uber is
[3:24:12.700 --> 3:24:16.860]  now demanding that customers who have been flagged for previously refusing to wear a mask,
[3:24:17.660 --> 3:24:24.140]  take a mask selfie within the app, or be barred from using the service altogether in future.
[3:24:24.140 --> 3:24:29.020]  Because you can trust Uber to have pictures of your face on record,
[3:24:30.300 --> 3:24:33.900]  because we all know they have a sterling record of privacy top notch.
[3:24:34.780 --> 3:24:41.260]  A lecturing new ad campaign from the taxi service screams, no mask, no ride, we said it, we meant it.
[3:24:42.860 --> 3:24:49.100]  I mean, my word, like you're literally trying to reach out to customers and give them some advice,
[3:24:49.100 --> 3:24:55.180]  and you're treating them like naughty little children who've stolen a cookie from the cookie jar.
[3:24:56.940 --> 3:25:00.220]  The company then touts its mask verification service,
[3:25:01.100 --> 3:25:07.580]  which forces customers who were previously reported by drivers for not wearing a mask
[3:25:07.580 --> 3:25:12.220]  to take a picture of their mask face within the app to be allowed to use the service again.
[3:25:12.220 --> 3:25:19.580]  Now, yeah, I'll go back to what I said before. Most taxi drivers, most black cab drivers,
[3:25:19.580 --> 3:25:23.740]  because they're slightly different, as we all know, in the United Kingdom at least,
[3:25:24.620 --> 3:25:29.340]  do not care if you're wearing a mask or not. Many Uber drivers wouldn't care if you're wearing
[3:25:29.340 --> 3:25:35.180]  a mask or not. But once they get it down to the level where they can report people,
[3:25:35.180 --> 3:25:40.700]  they can flag people, then again, that entices people to exercise that petty form of power,
[3:25:40.700 --> 3:25:44.940]  because it gives them some sense of importance within their personal life,
[3:25:44.940 --> 3:25:50.540]  which they otherwise don't have. So they will exploit it to the end's degree.
[3:25:51.820 --> 3:25:55.100]  Continues by saying, now, if you're ever flagged for not wearing a mask,
[3:25:55.100 --> 3:26:00.380]  you'll have to take a selfie in the app to verify that you're wearing one before your next ride.
[3:26:01.180 --> 3:26:06.700]  Respondents on Twitter weren't too keen on the idea. Nanny State aesthetics are going to kill
[3:26:06.700 --> 3:26:12.220]  companies, said one. Well, probably not in London, because it's a monopoly. Again,
[3:26:12.220 --> 3:26:18.060]  they had basically zero competition. They're dead set on making city life as miserable,
[3:26:18.060 --> 3:26:22.060]  as unbearable as possible right now, remarked another. Another one said,
[3:26:22.060 --> 3:26:26.940]  that copy makes me one never want to ride with Uber again, so effing whack. And yeah,
[3:26:26.940 --> 3:26:32.300]  that's the point. They're literally screeching at their own customers. That's how empowered
[3:26:32.300 --> 3:26:39.900]  they are. With righteous indignation, Uber feel by this mask policy. Now, as I know in the article,
[3:26:41.580 --> 3:26:47.020]  Uber seems very concerned about protecting its passengers. Didn't seem too concerned about
[3:26:47.020 --> 3:26:53.260]  protecting its passengers from being raped by its own drivers, especially in London,
[3:26:53.260 --> 3:26:59.820]  especially in the United Kingdom, because that's a pretty big problem with Uber drivers in London.
[3:26:59.820 --> 3:27:05.260]  They tend to get a bit rapey with the female passengers. But again, when this was brought
[3:27:05.260 --> 3:27:11.580]  to light, when you had literally all around London, which I've seen, warning about women
[3:27:11.580 --> 3:27:15.900]  getting into Uber cars because they're going to get sexually assaulted, they're going to get raped.
[3:27:16.540 --> 3:27:21.180]  Uber completely ignored the problem, but they really care about their customers, just not
[3:27:21.180 --> 3:27:25.980]  if they're being raped by the drivers. And in the article I flashed back to this headline,
[3:27:25.980 --> 3:27:34.460]  Uber sexual assault, 6,000 sexual assault reports in two years as London considers license appeal.
[3:27:35.260 --> 3:27:39.020]  Because again, they were about to get banned in London a couple of years ago. It never happened.
[3:27:40.140 --> 3:27:45.100]  It says Uber has recorded about 3,000 sexual assault allegations in both of the last two years,
[3:27:45.100 --> 3:27:50.620]  according to its latest report. The figure disclosed in a long awaited safety study found
[3:27:50.620 --> 3:27:56.780]  that thousands of people in the US, same in the UK, had reported sexual assaults at the hands
[3:27:56.780 --> 3:28:01.660]  of its drivers, including hundreds of reports of rape. And especially in the United Kingdom,
[3:28:02.460 --> 3:28:07.900]  there's a certain type of demographic that tends to drive Uber cars, and that's meshes with the
[3:28:07.900 --> 3:28:14.220]  same kind of demographic that likes to engage in rape and sexual assault. But again, Uber really
[3:28:14.220 --> 3:28:20.140]  cares about their passengers safety. So not only put on the mask, but now prove that you're a loyal
[3:28:20.140 --> 3:28:28.780]  good citizen and take a selfie with it in the air. Or you get denied service. Again, what does that
[3:28:28.780 --> 3:28:34.060]  say to you about what's happening in the United Kingdom across Europe? This is the Chinese communist
[3:28:34.060 --> 3:28:41.180]  social credit score. This is you being denied services, essential services, because you don't
[3:28:41.180 --> 3:28:46.460]  conform, because you express opinions on Facebook, as we've seen in Australia with women, pregnant
[3:28:46.460 --> 3:28:52.620]  women, women being arrested for trying to organize protests, or even posting about protests. Again,
[3:28:52.620 --> 3:29:00.780]  anyone who defies gets punished by having services, essential services withdrawn. That is classic
[3:29:00.780 --> 3:29:06.380]  communist Chinese social credit score. And now it's Uber's official policy.
[3:29:08.380 --> 3:29:15.580]  Meanwhile, missing boy found dead after family friends barred from searching due to COVID lockdown.
[3:29:15.580 --> 3:29:21.020]  Oh, but if it only saves one life, well, it didn't say one life, this boy's now dead. Well done.
[3:29:21.020 --> 3:29:27.020]  A teenage boy with autism was found deceased near Melbourne, Australia. Over 32 hours after he had
[3:29:27.020 --> 3:29:30.940]  gone missing, and after his family and local residents were ordered to call off searching due
[3:29:30.940 --> 3:29:37.820]  to draconian coronavirus rules. William Wall 14, embarked on his daily run at approximately
[3:29:37.820 --> 3:29:43.740]  645 AM on Tuesday morning, but never came home. A massive search effort was launched with family
[3:29:43.740 --> 3:29:50.540]  and friends joining authorities to look for William. Victoria Police. And again, this is the same
[3:29:50.540 --> 3:29:56.460]  police force that you've seen on video, arresting journalists for covering COVID lockdown protests,
[3:29:57.260 --> 3:30:01.980]  choking women, dragging them to the ground for not wearing masks. This is the same
[3:30:02.620 --> 3:30:08.460]  honorable police force that was stationed outside apartment blocks when this draconian
[3:30:08.460 --> 3:30:14.940]  Melbourne lockdown was first announced to prevent people leaving their homes. Same police force
[3:30:14.940 --> 3:30:20.540]  eventually told civilians they could no longer participate and must return home or risk violating
[3:30:20.540 --> 3:30:26.860]  current rules barring state residents from traveling more than five kilometers from their homes.
[3:30:26.860 --> 3:30:32.940]  Turns out the boy was less than two kilometers from the home and he was later found dead.
[3:30:33.740 --> 3:30:37.820]  Maybe because there weren't enough people searching for him because of coronavirus
[3:30:37.820 --> 3:30:42.700]  lockdown rules. Another fantastic victory. You've now entered the month number eight of the global
[3:30:42.700 --> 3:30:47.500]  lockdown and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation. But the
[3:30:47.500 --> 3:30:53.900]  good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well. The general public all over the planet
[3:30:54.460 --> 3:31:00.140]  hate Bill Gates. He's the most unpopular person on earth. People know he's not a doctor. People
[3:31:00.140 --> 3:31:05.980]  know he's a eugenicist. The population knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with
[3:31:05.980 --> 3:31:12.540]  cancer viruses, polio, steroids and more. It's even in the associated press. So now they're
[3:31:12.540 --> 3:31:17.980]  beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global government
[3:31:17.980 --> 3:31:23.020]  and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war
[3:31:23.020 --> 3:31:29.580]  scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing. So remember that and let them know that we know
[3:31:29.580 --> 3:31:35.260]  who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization.
[3:31:35.260 --> 3:31:42.140]  They are the enemies of humanity. They want you dead. Last week Tucker Carlson came out and said
[3:31:42.140 --> 3:31:48.220]  America is becoming the Soviet Union. In many ways we're worse than the Soviet Union. The Soviet
[3:31:48.220 --> 3:31:52.780]  Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do, surveilling and censoring us. And we're going to
[3:31:52.780 --> 3:31:57.500]  get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to force inoculations and the medical tyranny
[3:31:57.500 --> 3:32:02.460]  being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what you can and can't say online.
[3:32:02.460 --> 3:32:07.500]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting for its life and the enemy's number
[3:32:07.500 --> 3:32:12.940]  one mission is to get Trump out of office and number two is to silence info wars because we
[3:32:12.940 --> 3:32:18.860]  understand just how diabolical they are, just how evil they are and we won't miss words. We know
[3:32:18.860 --> 3:32:23.020]  who the global star we've got their number and we know how to beat them and we cover it seven
[3:32:23.020 --> 3:32:28.300]  days a week live at info wars and it's only because of your support. So keep spreading the
[3:32:28.300 --> 3:32:33.580]  word keep praying for us and take advantage of the sales and get great products at infohorsetour.com
[3:32:33.580 --> 3:32:44.140]  now. The globalists are hoping you don't visit infohorsetour.com and perhaps most cruely of all
[3:32:44.860 --> 3:32:50.780]  if Donald Trump has his way the complications from COVID-19 which are well beyond
[3:32:52.460 --> 3:32:57.260]  what they should be. It's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[3:32:57.260 --> 3:33:03.100]  200 million people have died. Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[3:33:03.660 --> 3:33:09.420]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19
[3:33:09.420 --> 3:33:14.540]  when it's not even 200,000 in reality, he would honestly say 6 million have lung scarring and
[3:33:14.540 --> 3:33:18.620]  heart damage. It's all made up. But you know where you got it? The mainstream media that continues
[3:33:18.620 --> 3:33:25.660]  to actually say things like that. They said that 4% of America would be dead already. Of course,
[3:33:25.660 --> 3:33:33.180]  it's 0.000 and then add a number because the numbers vary. It's a real virus just like people
[3:33:33.180 --> 3:33:39.100]  being struck by lightning is real. But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria
[3:33:39.100 --> 3:33:45.420]  and is mind control. The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally. They've
[3:33:45.420 --> 3:33:51.740]  aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly spiritually. We are living at a
[3:33:51.740 --> 3:33:58.060]  point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny of our species. That's why
[3:33:58.060 --> 3:34:02.940]  big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down,
[3:34:03.820 --> 3:34:09.180]  isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone, and traffic control every aspect of our lives,
[3:34:09.180 --> 3:34:13.980]  literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us
[3:34:13.980 --> 3:34:19.980]  to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance
[3:34:19.980 --> 3:34:25.100]  and the Enlightenment. They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high
[3:34:25.100 --> 3:34:30.780]  technology and life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through
[3:34:30.780 --> 3:34:37.020]  carbon credits and through a social credit score. This is their plan. We must come together and
[3:34:37.020 --> 3:34:50.700]  awaken out of our trance and say, no, we mustn't race God. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:56.700 --> 3:35:01.340]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit Top News Headquarters
[3:35:01.340 --> 3:35:11.180]  in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson. This is your last chance to get a pack power stack
[3:35:11.180 --> 3:35:15.740]  and I'm really bummed out about that. It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did
[3:35:15.740 --> 3:35:20.060]  ordered it loved it and started reordering it. They spread the word and became one of our best
[3:35:20.060 --> 3:35:25.340]  sellers. But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas
[3:35:25.340 --> 3:35:33.020]  in a pack power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore. This is the highest end AMPM pack system
[3:35:33.020 --> 3:35:37.020]  you're going to find where you take half the pills in the morning, half the capitals and pills and
[3:35:37.020 --> 3:35:41.420]  shell caps at night. It's amazing. I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this
[3:35:41.420 --> 3:35:45.420]  gets people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect because the
[3:35:45.420 --> 3:35:50.380]  stuff in here is absolutely amazing. So it's your last chance to get a power stack at infowarstore.com.
[3:35:50.380 --> 3:35:55.260]  It's 60% off and free shipping. That is at cost for all of you that already support info wars.

[3:35:59.500 --> 3:36:04.860]  Last chance to get it infowarstore.com. APEC power stack, 6% off and free shipping.
[3:36:14.140 --> 3:36:19.180]  And we are back and we're talking about Joe Rogan because of course we've had a back and
[3:36:19.180 --> 3:36:23.660]  forth with Rogan over the past few weeks because his new show launched on Spotify.
[3:36:23.660 --> 3:36:29.260]  The same show but under a new licensing deal back on September 1st. He's now
[3:36:30.140 --> 3:36:35.180]  three and a half weeks in. They're having mutinies in the New York office of people saying they
[3:36:35.180 --> 3:36:42.060]  literally want to go back into his archives and edit the content. These are Spotify employees.
[3:36:42.060 --> 3:36:49.260]  This isn't even the management. And to be honest, I mean Rogan's been quite poor at addressing these
[3:36:49.260 --> 3:36:53.260]  questions, especially over his official Twitter account. He seems to want to stay out of it
[3:36:53.260 --> 3:36:57.580]  at least publicly for the time being. And I can understand why to some extent, but
[3:36:58.380 --> 3:37:04.380]  he's not really given any pushback publicly. Of course, we know three weeks ago when the
[3:37:04.380 --> 3:37:12.060]  transfer happened over to Spotify of Rogan's old podcast library. It was missing several
[3:37:12.060 --> 3:37:18.460]  interesting episodes, including those featuring Alex Jones, Owen Benjamin, Steph Mullen,
[3:37:18.460 --> 3:37:25.660]  U. Milo, Unopolis, Gavin McKinnis, Charles Johnson, and Sorgan Avakad. Strange. Almost
[3:37:25.660 --> 3:37:33.020]  like there's some kind of pattern there in terms of the right wing or the centrist even in some
[3:37:33.020 --> 3:37:39.260]  cases. Episodes being completely expunged from history. And of course we had this ridiculous
[3:37:39.260 --> 3:37:44.620]  bait and switch where at first it seemed like Spotify was claiming this was just a mistake
[3:37:44.620 --> 3:37:50.060]  and that these episodes would come back. And indeed they did come back because I remember
[3:37:50.060 --> 3:37:55.420]  hosting this show and we were talking about it a few weeks ago. And I checked the Spotify list
[3:37:55.420 --> 3:38:01.980]  for Rogan's podcast archive and Alex Jones's episode, all these other episodes have been
[3:38:01.980 --> 3:38:08.700]  added back in. Then lo and behold, two days later, they'd all been removed again. So there's a tug
[3:38:08.700 --> 3:38:16.380]  of war going on within Spotify between the management and between these hysterical, maniacal,
[3:38:16.380 --> 3:38:21.100]  woke, imbecile employees who literally think they're God, who literally think that they can
[3:38:21.100 --> 3:38:27.980]  control the narrative, the conversation. How weak does Spotify's management have to be,
[3:38:27.980 --> 3:38:34.460]  given that they've signed a $100 million licensing agreement with Rogan? Probably the biggest
[3:38:34.460 --> 3:38:40.860]  podcaster in history at this point. And they're being bullied by these little weakling, pathetic
[3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:47.100]  soyboy office employees in New York. They're literally being bullied by those people,
[3:38:47.100 --> 3:38:54.540]  headline out of zero hedge. Remove Rogan, Spotify staffers threaten strike unless hate
[3:38:54.540 --> 3:39:01.900]  filled podcasts removed. And not just removal, listen to this. Having blown $100 million to lock
[3:39:01.900 --> 3:39:07.580]  in infamously outspoken and uncensored podcaster Joe Rogan, Spotify is facing an internal revolt
[3:39:07.580 --> 3:39:14.300]  from the woke mob who've demanded broad based editorial control, censorship, and even removal
[3:39:14.300 --> 3:39:19.660]  of the world's most popular podcasts or else. And it talks about the ones that they already
[3:39:19.660 --> 3:39:25.420]  removed, which I touched upon a minute ago. But as digital music news reports, Spotify
[3:39:25.420 --> 3:39:31.420]  employees were demanding direct editorial oversight over the recently acquired Rogan experience
[3:39:31.420 --> 3:39:38.940]  podcast. That would include the ability to directly edit or remove sections of upcoming
[3:39:38.940 --> 3:39:45.660]  interviews or block the uploading of episodes deemed problematic, which of course is their
[3:39:45.660 --> 3:39:51.340]  catch all word for anything that offends them, which is literally everything. The employees
[3:39:51.340 --> 3:39:59.100]  also demanded the ability to add trigger warnings. What is this 2015 all over again? Trigger warnings,
[3:39:59.100 --> 3:40:05.500]  corrections and references to fact checked articles on topics discussed by Rogan in the
[3:40:05.500 --> 3:40:11.420]  course of his multi hour discussions. There are some Joe Rogan podcasts, which is why I can't
[3:40:11.420 --> 3:40:17.020]  listen to them sometimes, which are literally five hours long. They're going to have fact
[3:40:17.020 --> 3:40:24.460]  checkers sitting there listening to Joe Rogan shoot the breeze with some guest who isn't even
[3:40:24.460 --> 3:40:31.180]  an official political figure, like half the people he has on a comedians, you're going to fact check
[3:40:31.180 --> 3:40:39.180]  a five hour conversation, a five hour freewheeling off the cuff conversation between two comedians.
[3:40:42.300 --> 3:40:48.380]  Like how nervous of Rogan's reach are they at this point? They're literally revolting and asking
[3:40:48.380 --> 3:40:56.060]  to be given the power, not asking demanding to fact check five hour podcast conversations
[3:40:56.060 --> 3:41:05.660]  between drunk comedians. What the hell? Oh my God, it continues. If they're not granted
[3:41:05.660 --> 3:41:10.540]  these Ministry of Truth oversights, the mostly New York based staff are threatened to walk out
[3:41:10.540 --> 3:41:17.420]  or strike. By the way, they were emboldened by the fact that Spotify having initially restored
[3:41:17.420 --> 3:41:22.220]  these banned podcasts with Rogan, Mechanism, Nopoulos, Milo, Yiannopoulos and the others,
[3:41:23.260 --> 3:41:28.540]  they got the control to delete them once again. So they went back up and then they got deleted
[3:41:28.540 --> 3:41:35.180]  again. So the sharks smell blood. And now because the management of Spotify is apparently so weak
[3:41:35.820 --> 3:41:42.380]  that it allows its own employees in a New York office to have more power than they do
[3:41:42.380 --> 3:41:48.700]  in terms of editorial oversight. Now they're going to give them more power. Again, this mob
[3:41:48.700 --> 3:41:55.100]  mentality, this cave immediately mentality is going to come back to bite them in the butt.
[3:41:56.460 --> 3:42:03.740]  Article continues. They quote Joe Rogan who when this deal was announced with Spotify said the
[3:42:03.740 --> 3:42:10.140]  following quote, they want me to just can't. I'm sorry for laughing, but this in hindsight,
[3:42:10.140 --> 3:42:15.820]  this is hilarious. They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.
[3:42:15.820 --> 3:42:23.100]  It's just a licensing deal, bro. So Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.
[3:42:23.980 --> 3:42:29.500]  It will be the exact same show. They're going to be working with the same crew doing the exact
[3:42:29.500 --> 3:42:36.620]  same show. Those words seem quite absurd at this point, don't they? Not only are Spotify employees
[3:42:36.620 --> 3:42:42.060]  revolting, threatening to strike and walk out. If they don't get given the power to delete
[3:42:42.060 --> 3:42:49.260]  episodes, they now want literally have little weasley woke fact checkers sit in five hour
[3:42:49.260 --> 3:42:55.100]  episodes between Rogan and other comedians talking off the cuff, freewheeling for five hours. They
[3:42:55.100 --> 3:43:02.620]  want to give them the power to edit the episodes. So it's not really the same show, is it, Joe?
[3:43:02.620 --> 3:43:09.020]  It's not. I mean, it makes YouTube look like a bastion of free speech. Like at least YouTube
[3:43:09.020 --> 3:43:15.900]  didn't have woke monitors listening into every Rogan podcast and going into the video file
[3:43:15.900 --> 3:43:24.460]  and editing out certain triggering sections. This is 10 times worse than that. It says,
[3:43:25.420 --> 3:43:30.940]  while the C-suite may want that and the eyeballs or ear holes, it seems the outrage mob of employees
[3:43:30.940 --> 3:43:37.020]  does not. Again, the article makes the point. These Spotify employees that are demanding all this power
[3:43:38.380 --> 3:43:44.860]  just fire them. Just fire them. Like how can the CEO not have the power to just fire these people?
[3:43:45.420 --> 3:43:49.900]  How many Americans have been unemployed as a result of this lockdown? How many Americans
[3:43:49.900 --> 3:43:56.620]  would be perfectly happy to work in an office in a major city for Spotify to basically click
[3:43:56.620 --> 3:44:05.740]  buttons? By the way, these Spotify employees earn $120,000 to $130,000 a year. God only knows why.
[3:44:06.460 --> 3:44:12.060]  I mean, you could save a lot of money. The Spotify CEO, Daniel Eck, he could save a lot
[3:44:12.060 --> 3:44:20.140]  of money by just firing them. Just fire them. Who knows what's going to happen with Rogan's podcast,
[3:44:20.140 --> 3:44:27.260]  but at the moment, three weeks in doesn't look very good, does it? Meanwhile, over in France,
[3:44:27.260 --> 3:44:31.900]  where we had the attempted bomb attack on the Eiffel Tower a couple of days ago,
[3:44:31.900 --> 3:44:37.500]  French prosecutors threatening machete attack, treating machete attack near former Charlie
[3:44:37.500 --> 3:44:44.460]  Hebdo officers as terrorism. Basically, a guy with a machete attacked. Initially, they said four
[3:44:44.460 --> 3:44:50.460]  people and they said two people. I think two people are critically ill. Turns out he's an 18-year-old
[3:44:50.460 --> 3:44:57.260]  Pakistani migrant. Imagine my shock. Meanwhile, in London, Breitbart reports London cop killer was
[3:44:57.260 --> 3:45:03.740]  known to counter terrorism police. So again, after months and months of anti-cop BLM rhetoric,
[3:45:03.740 --> 3:45:09.260]  after those disgraceful scenes of British police kneeling to BLM agitators,
[3:45:09.260 --> 3:45:15.660]  now one of their own has been shot dead in a police station in South London, and initial reports
