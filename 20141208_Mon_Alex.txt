[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.160 --> 00:37.920]  former director of the NSA is sub director William Benny will be joining us today
[00:37.920 --> 00:46.000]  other than that wow look at the Hill newspaper watchdog groups brace for
[00:46.000 --> 00:55.920]  surprises in massive 1.014 trillion dollar spending bill and if you go back
[00:55.920 --> 01:03.560]  to drudgereport.com or drudge has a stack of stories dealing with this the
[01:03.560 --> 01:08.200]  Republicans are trying to keep its secret the provisions from the public
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.920]  saying that secrecy is justified they're working with the Democrats why so secret
[01:13.920 --> 01:19.800]  GOP keeps tight lid on 1 trillion spending bill conservatives claim
[01:19.800 --> 01:24.280]  leaders trying to pass before anyone can read it see notice it's only libertarians
[01:24.280 --> 01:30.800]  conservatives that are watchdogging the Republicans and the Democrats it's only
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.960]  the Tea Party-esque type people that care about anything I'm not saying they're
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.560]  perfect either but it's always that group fighting taking our guns getting
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.560]  rid of our borders making the president a dictator trying to stop tax increases
[01:45.560 --> 01:49.640]  trying to stop our power plants from being shut off trying to stop the
[01:49.640 --> 01:55.560]  federalization of all the schools the federalization of the police it was
[01:55.560 --> 01:58.240]  mainly conservatives starting to worry about the militarization of police
[01:58.240 --> 02:04.240]  that's why you have the Justice Department stir all this rioting up so
[02:04.240 --> 02:07.240]  they could then get conservatives to pile back on to supporting the police
[02:07.240 --> 02:19.320]  state but meanwhile in the bill inside the bill is the legislation for
[02:19.320 --> 02:23.400]  derivatives in fact I had two articles in my stack yesterday on that one by
[02:23.400 --> 02:29.360]  curtain ammo and another one by Krieger dealing with it where it just signs us
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.360]  on to unlimited derivatives new law would make taxpayers potentially
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.800]  liable for trillions in derivatives losses if the quadrillion dollar
[02:37.800 --> 02:43.320]  derivatives bubble implodes who should be stuck with the bill it's actually to
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.640]  quadrillion but I guess technically you can say the quadrillion bill or the
[02:47.640 --> 02:53.160]  quadrillions bill that story is up on info wars dot com by Michael Schneider
[02:53.160 --> 02:57.200]  the economic collapse blog and then links through to zero hedge and other
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.560]  reports in the as copy of the bill unsurprisingly the main backer of the
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.680]  bill that's rolled in the larger spending bill is notorious Wall Street
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.360]  lackey Jim Himes Democrat Connecticut a former Goldman Sachs employee who has
[03:12.360 --> 03:17.520]  discovered lobbyist payoffs can be just as lucrative as a career in financial
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.920]  services the last time mr. Himes made an appearance on these pages was in the
[03:21.920 --> 03:28.760]  March 2013 Congress moves to deregulate Wall Street so that's the kind of
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.400]  legislation being being being bundled up pork barreled into the omnibus
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.360]  spending bill and the Republican leadership is trying to keep most of its
[03:38.360 --> 03:49.920]  secret kind of like four separate times George Bush junior over and over and
[03:49.920 --> 03:56.920]  over again with the Republicans and Democrats kept its secret what was in
[03:56.920 --> 04:05.680]  the immigration bill but every time senator sessions would leak it to the
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.280]  public where it legalized felons a free tuition of illegals this is the plan
[04:12.280 --> 04:16.680]  this is what's being pushed this is what's being planned we're going to come
[04:16.680 --> 04:23.600]  back and break all of this down today and then the latest disgusting statement
[04:23.600 --> 04:32.680]  Barbara Bush gushes about Bill Clinton says he treats HW Bush like a father and
[04:32.680 --> 04:40.640]  then that ties in to Bush is out in the news today we have a video clip of that
[04:40.640 --> 04:46.240]  George W. Bush we've got some of his statements so we've got more statements
[04:46.240 --> 04:52.000]  from them you know basically calling Hillary Clinton family and things like

[08:14.880 --> 08:30.000]  human liberty Alex Jones Joseph Goebbels the oft-quoted minister of propaganda in
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.800]  Nazi Germany famously said in many different ways that propaganda needs to
[08:36.800 --> 08:44.440]  be simple and mindless and only allow people to be lazy and to buy into it it
[08:44.440 --> 08:53.800]  needs to be simple and easy not complex and I saw a quote by Eric Hoffer that
[08:53.800 --> 08:59.080]  basically says the same thing it's in a graphic on the front page of info wars.com
[08:59.080 --> 09:08.520]  today's main image propaganda does not deceive people it merely helps them to
[09:08.520 --> 09:18.920]  deceive themselves and that is exactly what we face dumb down simplistic mindless
[09:18.920 --> 09:33.920]  fraud it's up to us to discover the reality of what's being done to us not to
[09:33.920 --> 09:37.840]  look at who's wearing the nicest jacket or has the best hair or who has the
[09:37.840 --> 09:44.160]  nicest tie or who has the best speech writers but who is real and who is
[09:44.160 --> 09:50.640]  promoting common-sense ideas that have been successful and created amazing
[09:50.640 --> 09:58.840]  stability and prosperity for time in memorial we are teleprompter free radio
[09:58.840 --> 10:04.040]  teleprompter free television simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast across
[10:04.040 --> 10:09.000]  the United States info wars.com forward slash show to find the free video
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.160]  feeds because you will often hear me mentioning video or articles or
[10:14.160 --> 10:18.320]  legislation or documents that we have on screen so I call this radio
[10:18.320 --> 10:25.760]  transmission radio squared or radio to the next power we of course pioneered
[10:25.760 --> 10:33.520]  not just having a webcam I had a webcam off and on 14 years ago but we've
[10:33.520 --> 10:41.400]  pioneered the last decade plus simulcasting the radio with a full
[10:41.400 --> 10:54.640]  live news TV transmission adding a whole layer of reality and the reason I did
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.240]  that the reason I do that is the same reason that I made a documentary film
[10:59.240 --> 11:06.000]  my first film in 1997 America destroyed by design two years after I first got on
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.760]  air 20 years ago and it's because I had the state documents the state department
[11:13.760 --> 11:22.320]  documents the federal legislation the UN UNESCO treating I had all of it on our
[11:22.320 --> 11:28.600]  national parks and national heritage sites and huge buffer zones sometimes
[11:28.600 --> 11:36.600]  hundreds of miles around it being put under United Nations control and I had
[11:36.600 --> 11:41.200]  congressmen on to talk about it and I had physicists and scientists and
[11:41.200 --> 11:47.520]  environmental scientists on like Dr. Michael Kaufman who had the UN maps and
[11:47.520 --> 11:55.160]  had testified to Congress and people would call in and say it is insane the
[11:55.160 --> 12:02.360]  UN is not taking over our national parks the UN is not shutting down silver and
[12:02.360 --> 12:08.600]  gold mines in a case in Colorado 30 miles away from the park saying it's
[12:08.600 --> 12:13.520]  under a UN buffer zone but they did it was even in the Denver Post but I
[12:13.520 --> 12:19.760]  couldn't show people on radio what I was saying so I started in four wars calm
[12:19.760 --> 12:29.400]  in 96 as an attempt to link to the articles but back then most newspapers
[12:29.400 --> 12:39.040]  didn't even have their news online they would just have us the headline and then
[12:39.040 --> 12:42.400]  a link to a subscription area so I would do things like clip out the
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.360]  newspapers and I had listeners all over the country who would mail me the
[12:46.360 --> 12:51.840]  newspapers usually a week old and then I would clip them out and I would
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.920]  take photos of them and put them on info wars calm but then the problem was I
[12:57.920 --> 13:04.080]  couldn't afford the bandwidth bills of the thousands tens of thousands of
[13:04.080 --> 13:10.840]  people a day then now it's millions that visited info wars calm and so I said
[13:10.840 --> 13:17.560]  I've got to make money so I can pay this bandwidth and so I began to make films
[13:17.560 --> 13:23.200]  and sell films and tell people to make copies of them and I'm not going off a
[13:23.200 --> 13:31.240]  rabbit trail here I'm trying to get people to think about how 20 years ago
[13:31.240 --> 13:35.920]  almost no one knew the Federal Reserve was private and if you confronted
[13:35.920 --> 13:41.120]  someone with its charter they would laugh at you and say shut up kook because
[13:41.120 --> 13:46.080]  they didn't want to be involved they just needed some propaganda of the word
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.920]  conspiracy theorist that's simple that's mindless that's dumbed down that's an
[13:50.920 --> 13:59.840]  excuse for them to ignore what you're saying and move on now fast forward from
[13:59.840 --> 14:08.480]  1995 to what's about to be 2015 in just a few weeks people now know the Federal
[14:08.480 --> 14:13.360]  Reserve's private national polls over 90% people want it over 90% in Gallup
[14:13.360 --> 14:20.600]  polls audited or shut down the worm completely turned and the worms turning
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.680]  on abortion and the worms turning on gun control victim disarmament and the worm
[14:25.680 --> 14:33.760]  is turning on energy the worm is turning on everything we are on the verge of a
[14:33.760 --> 14:37.800]  complete political awakening and realignment of the magnitude that
[14:37.800 --> 14:42.160]  this world has never seen not just here in the United States but all over the
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.320]  globe so what are the technocrats going to do they're going to use their
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.440]  control of social networks to gatekeep what they allow to catch fire and
[14:50.440 --> 14:55.680]  they're only going to try to have violent socialist Fabian socialist and
[14:55.680 --> 15:00.600]  communist movements financed by Wall Street and other financial interest to
[15:00.600 --> 15:07.920]  be ineffectual revolutions that also discredit revolution now I'm not in the
[15:07.920 --> 15:12.880]  classical sense of revolutionary I am a restorationist I want my legitimate
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.720]  republic back because it's the best idea in history it works really well when
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.840]  implemented it produces more freedom more security more wealth than we can
[15:22.840 --> 15:28.040]  even handle and thus the byproduct the side effect of us being decadent usurped
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.160]  slobs on average at this point but the worms turning as we go out of
[15:33.160 --> 15:40.160]  prosperity into decadence into slouching into tyranny and then the Renaissance
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.760]  begins again and that's the type of revolution I want that's why I restate
[15:46.760 --> 15:53.920]  that routinely is a peaceful one of ideas you always hear oh let's have a
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.320]  shooting war oh let's you'll have a marching and go after the Capitol the
[15:59.320 --> 16:05.760]  system wants that because they're losing the long-term societal info war
[16:05.760 --> 16:08.720]  that's why they're trying to flood the country to turn us in the Tower of
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.560]  Babel where we can't communicate with each other and drive down the wages
[16:12.560 --> 16:16.040]  that's why they're trying to shut off the power that's why they're trying to
[16:16.040 --> 16:20.040]  increase the prices that's why they're desperately trying to stir up race war
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.360]  all over the country
[16:24.680 --> 16:34.760]  because they do not have a hope if they don't engage and divide and conquer
[16:34.760 --> 16:39.440]  yesterday on the Sunday show I talked about Sunday broadcast from 4 to 6 p.m.
[16:39.440 --> 16:46.720]  I talked about a comment on info wars on a story again out of Denver where
[16:46.720 --> 16:53.240]  during a anti-police demonstration anti-police brutality demonstration a
[16:53.240 --> 16:58.920]  couple cops got run over pretty bats two of them are in critical condition and
[16:58.920 --> 17:03.160]  the crowd began chanting hit him again run over him again and we do have that
[17:03.160 --> 17:07.880]  video we're gonna play it later and we said that was wrong and people in the
[17:07.880 --> 17:12.200]  comments a minority of them said oh now you're for the police what's your
[17:12.200 --> 17:17.680]  problem hit him hit him again students here when car runs into cops critically
[17:17.680 --> 17:23.960]  injuring one other thing too are critically injured and then a comment
[17:23.960 --> 17:30.320]  or below said no info wars sides with who's right on a case-by-case basis not
[17:30.320 --> 17:34.400]  off of what color you are not off of what group you are and that's absolutely
[17:34.400 --> 17:41.760]  right and I can't believe how mindless and tribal people got whether it's the
[17:41.760 --> 17:45.480]  cops whether it's white people mixed folks black people whatever humans are
[17:45.480 --> 17:51.720]  all humans we have just the same very tribal very dumb down because the cops
[17:51.720 --> 17:55.800]  have now been caught in Indianapolis tweeting out I can't breathe hashtag
[17:55.800 --> 18:00.960]  basically making fun of people unbelievably horrible just like
[18:00.960 --> 18:06.080]  chanting run over the cops some more it's the same mindless tribal garbage
[18:06.080 --> 18:10.000]  that will end our civilization
[18:10.000 --> 18:18.080]  disgusting by the way now the NFL has picked up the case of the black man
[18:18.080 --> 18:21.480]  choked to death and I believe it's manslaughter the cop was allowed off I
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.280]  think it's a travesty of justice and now the NFL wants to put on their shoes
[18:26.280 --> 18:31.880]  I can't breathe that's a lot better than making brown their poster child because
[18:31.880 --> 18:35.840]  brown was a thug the evidence is overwhelming and that's not the poster
[18:35.840 --> 18:48.640]  boy to reform the police that is not the horse we need to bet on here I want
[18:48.640 --> 18:59.000]  to reform the police so bad it makes my head spin the case of Eric Garner or the
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.380]  case of Kelly Thomas now those are cases people should be looking at but see the
[19:02.380 --> 19:07.720]  media only picks up on racial incidences because it drives ratings but
[19:07.720 --> 19:11.240]  that's only at the grassroots level in the media at the higher level it is
[19:11.240 --> 19:16.280]  pushed and promulgated by the talking heads of the White House and the social
[19:16.280 --> 19:21.520]  engineers because it's a Ford Foundation playbook to create division now I'm done
[19:21.520 --> 19:24.920]  talking about that I just wanted to basically get into that because that's
[19:24.920 --> 19:29.080]  why they dumb the propaganda down propaganda does not deceive people it
[19:29.080 --> 19:34.720]  merely helps them to deceive themselves Eric Hoffer and I absolutely agree with
[19:34.720 --> 19:41.240]  that statement so this broadcast is the opposite of dumb down talking point
[19:41.240 --> 19:46.120]  stupidity this is history integrated with research integrated with common sense
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.000]  integrated with art types of what really makes humans tick we're gonna come back
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.280]  with George W. Bush saying Hillary is his sister-in-law totally disgusting these
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.640]  families work together this holiday season give the gift that keeps on giving
[20:01.640 --> 20:05.920]  an in-home freeze dryer from harvest right with your very own freeze dryer

[24:37.680 --> 24:45.680]  demonstrations aimed at distracting everyone from the globalist real agenda
[24:45.680 --> 24:50.840]  and what's the real agenda I think I'm going to shoot a special report for the
[24:50.840 --> 24:54.680]  nightly news but I want to spend a few days producing it and really add a lot
[24:54.680 --> 25:04.640]  of research to it with the author of compromised Clinton Bush and the CIA we
[25:04.640 --> 25:08.000]  need to get read back on the show he probably had been on in five years and
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.480]  all the other experts and the Iran contra documents because it wasn't Reagan
[25:13.480 --> 25:17.920]  running Iran country it was George Herbert Walker Bush with the Democrats as
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.840]  well they just kind of double crossed them and the Clintons it's been
[25:22.840 --> 25:29.560]  declassified we're both CIA a fake couple they were under the UK section chief
[25:29.560 --> 25:35.720]  for the CIA when they were Rhodes scholars they were installed as you know
[25:35.720 --> 25:42.320]  co-governors basically in Arkansas George Herbert Walker Bush met 11 times
[25:42.320 --> 25:47.800]  that we know of in the year before Bill Clinton ran as governor he would visit
[25:47.800 --> 25:51.520]  him and Kenny Buckport main he would stay at his home in Houston I mean these
[25:51.520 --> 25:57.600]  people were thick as thieves now back then they acted like they were enemies but
[25:57.600 --> 26:02.080]  the former CIA director also got caught lying he wasn't made CIA director out of
[26:02.080 --> 26:08.080]  nowhere he was in the CIA right after he got out of the Army Air Corps was the
[26:08.080 --> 26:16.720]  Navy Air Corps he was in the Navy flying aircraft in World War two so who you
[26:16.720 --> 26:20.720]  think George Herbert Walker Bush is isn't who he is he's like Vladimir Putin
[26:20.720 --> 26:29.880]  Vladimir Putin is a KGB front slash FSB today and that's exactly what the
[26:29.880 --> 26:35.720]  Bushes are and they created the Clintons to be their go-between and I remember
[26:35.720 --> 26:44.840]  having Larry Nichols and Terry Reed and just all the insiders on back in the
[26:44.840 --> 26:48.920]  90s breaking this down and now I mean back then we talked about it people
[26:48.920 --> 26:55.440]  thought it was wild now it's basically admitted we have Laura we have Barbara we
[26:55.440 --> 27:02.120]  have Bush senior we have Bush junior we have Jeb we have Marvin we have all of
[27:02.120 --> 27:07.400]  them worshipping the Clintons and let me tell you when you look at the Bush's
[27:07.400 --> 27:12.040]  agenda versus their rhetoric and compare it with the Clintons it is a carbon
[27:12.040 --> 27:20.160]  copy a carbon copy and this goes to the rhinos and the and the Rockefeller
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.960]  Republicans as George Herbert Walker Bush called himself back in the 70s they
[27:25.960 --> 27:29.600]  are what they call Rockefeller Republicans if you can't beat Barry
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.400]  Goldwater if you can't beat the real conservative movement well you just
[27:34.400 --> 27:39.200]  simply co-opted national review was founded by the central intelligence
[27:39.200 --> 27:45.960]  agency to control the right look it up William F. Buckley CIA just like
[27:45.960 --> 27:51.120]  Anderson Cooper CIA just like Miss magazine look it up Gloria Steinem
[27:51.120 --> 27:59.120]  founded by the CIA New York Times look it up look it up they want to control the
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.280]  fake left-right paradigm we're transcending it
[28:03.280 --> 28:07.160]  sure there's a lot more I agree with the Republicans in their rhetoric but they
[28:07.160 --> 28:13.040]  don't follow it the Texas Republican Party Charter and platform sounds like I
[28:13.040 --> 28:19.520]  wrote it but they don't follow it and the system scared that it might trip to
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.200]  happen so we have Barbara Bush and we have Bush let's go to the newest one with
[28:25.200 --> 28:30.640]  George W. calling Hillary his sister-in-law here it is you've often
[28:30.640 --> 28:33.840]  referred to Bill Clinton and you talked about his relationship with your father
[28:33.840 --> 28:38.680]  and how it developed in your mother as well and he's your brother from another
[28:38.680 --> 28:43.560]  mother what does that make Hillary Clinton to the British family my sister in
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.400]  law interesting and do you think that your brother could run against your
[28:48.400 --> 28:54.240]  sister-in-law yeah and I think he'd beat her do you and he's formidable very
[28:54.240 --> 28:59.440]  much so no questions so is he though so you'll take that back formidable you
[28:59.440 --> 29:01.800]  think she'll run of course you're not gonna make it because you're an objective
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.480]  news to the family that's what I'm asking you directly control my old clue in

[29:17.920 --> 29:25.080]  remind people of this because I was in a gun shop back in like 2007 and I was
[29:25.080 --> 29:28.600]  complaining about Bush supporting the assault weapons ban and a guy behind the
[29:28.600 --> 29:33.520]  counter McBrides said Alex I'm sick of your always say something true he does
[29:33.520 --> 29:40.960]  not support that and the owner goes yeah he does that's true he's right I mean

[33:26.440 --> 33:32.960]  let's hear from another one of the bushes the grand matriarch Barbara Bush
[33:32.960 --> 33:43.880]  mama of the whole CIA brood of skull and bones pirates that's right my husband
[33:43.880 --> 33:50.840]  Bill Clinton I have become great friends and bill visits us every summer and we
[33:50.840 --> 33:57.560]  don't agree politically but we don't talk politics and I think you'd have to
[33:57.560 --> 34:05.520]  understand I read someplace before you're critical of someone you should
[34:05.520 --> 34:14.440]  remember that they did not have the advantages you had as a child of loving
[34:14.440 --> 34:22.080]  mother and father and Bill's father wasn't around and I think that he thinks
[34:22.080 --> 34:27.800]  of George a little bit like the father he didn't have and he's very loving to
[34:27.800 --> 34:32.800]  him and I really appreciate that and when they went on that long tsunami trip
[34:32.800 --> 34:39.080]  George told me Bill insisted he stay in the bed and Bill insisted that he was
[34:39.080 --> 34:45.920]  taken care of and that was really nice I I love Bill Clinton maybe nice politics
[34:45.920 --> 34:54.320]  but I love pure unadulterated script reading bull a behind-the-scenes with
[34:54.320 --> 34:59.160]  Barbara Bush where she really tells you what's going on isn't that just so
[34:59.160 --> 35:07.280]  sweet meanwhile I have interviewed known-admitted CIA not assets but
[35:07.280 --> 35:17.040]  employees agents who were at Mina and saw the Bush's Clinton all of them they
[35:17.040 --> 35:22.620]  would meet there at the airfield where the goodies were coming in C 130 by C
[35:22.620 --> 35:33.480]  130 oh there's such a nice little family there's such nice little boys
[35:34.800 --> 35:40.200]  Bill Clinton was the protege of the CIA section chief in England and then he was
[35:40.200 --> 35:47.080]  assigned under George Herbert Walker Bush look it up Hillary as well but it's
[35:47.080 --> 35:54.280]  worse than that the Rhodes scholarship on record set up by Cecil Rhodes who
[35:54.280 --> 35:59.600]  wrote books on how they were going to establish a world corporate government
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.240]  and fold the British Empire into that by stealth so that no one could stop them
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.440]  from taking over and merging with the United States which is what the Council
[36:08.440 --> 36:16.600]  on Foreign Relations was set up for in New York City on at the Pratt House in
[36:16.600 --> 36:27.640]  1922 and what does skull and bones push for all the exact same program that's
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.200]  all these people are just like Vladimir Putin they are fronts for the
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.680]  special interests that run this country and then oh we've got two different
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.440]  political parties and it looks like there's differences on the surface but
[36:40.440 --> 36:43.800]  when it comes down to brass tacks it's exactly the same and there's a quote by
[36:43.800 --> 36:49.960]  Carol Quigley in his book tragedy and hope the head of Georgetown political
[36:49.960 --> 36:55.200]  science Bill Clinton's other mentor that he thanked in his victory speech by the
[36:55.200 --> 37:00.440]  way he thanked Carol Quigley and David Rockefeller and then he broke down
[37:00.440 --> 37:08.040]  crying and said that David Rockefeller was like his father and there's a lot
[37:08.040 --> 37:14.680]  of evidence that he's the illegitimate son of the then governor of Arkansas who
[37:14.680 --> 37:19.320]  was a Rockefeller when he was born and it's admitted that Bill Clinton's mother
[37:19.320 --> 37:26.720]  was a lady of the night and then he's got this supposed father that looks or
[37:26.720 --> 37:31.760]  acts of thing like him the point is Clinton who's famously filmed meeting
[37:31.760 --> 37:38.960]  with JFK when he was a teenager Bill Clinton meeting with JFK shaking hands
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.960]  with JFK being brought to meet with like eight other youths with JFK he was
[37:43.960 --> 37:48.800]  fast-tracked from the beginning and of course we said this back in 1995 1996
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.600]  97 and it sounded crazy now it's all admitted
[37:54.600 --> 38:04.760]  this is how they operate and now we see John Boehner Mitch McConnell and others
[38:04.760 --> 38:12.280]  not letting the public see the spending bill over a trillion dollars
[38:12.280 --> 38:25.600]  not going after him for fast and furious or Benghazi not trying to repeal any of
[38:25.600 --> 38:32.040]  his unlawful executive actions not trying to stop the open borders saying
[38:32.040 --> 38:37.840]  they won't repeal Obamacare to me this is really the big issue that we just had
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.040]  a landslide despite the fact of the blue blood Republicans tried to block every
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.080]  tea party person they could they failed massively but still they're hanging on by
[38:47.080 --> 38:51.480]  their fingernails right now half of the senators that voted for Obamacare are
[38:51.480 --> 38:59.440]  now gone so there is a political awakening we are actually getting things
[38:59.440 --> 39:04.640]  done it's been said that if elections did anything they'd be illegal they was
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.280]  Mark Twain said that but that's not entirely true if there's enough of an
[39:10.280 --> 39:15.240]  awakening at the city county state federal level we could actually save
[39:15.240 --> 39:21.520]  this country peacefully but I look at this headline this photo from Politico
[39:21.520 --> 39:28.320]  House Senate negotiators near spending deal the goal is to have the massive
[39:28.320 --> 39:33.960]  measure ready by late today Monday and I look at Mitch McConnell with Harry Reid
[39:33.960 --> 39:42.040]  John Boehner Nancy Pelosi I mean who are these people and I gotta be honest with
[39:42.040 --> 39:48.800]  you I don't know who I dislike more Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid it's probably Harry
[39:48.800 --> 39:55.880]  Reid I hate of these four people let me see Harry Reid is number one and then
[39:55.880 --> 40:03.400]  Nancy Pelosi's number two and then Boehner's number three and then McConnell's
[40:03.400 --> 40:09.440]  number four because at least McConnell has unenergetically but but but still
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.000]  voted to block anti-gun measures Boehner's actually supported some before
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.380]  Pelosi is just a larcenist demon on every level and then Harry Reid is an
[40:18.380 --> 40:25.040]  actual don I mean these people all make me want to vomit but I gotta be honest
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.600]  with you I think I dislike Boehner and McConnell at an even deeper level because
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.200]  I know how bad Pelosi and Harry Reid are with their armed bodyguards but they
[40:35.200 --> 40:38.360]  want our guns and they think our kids belong to them they're just arrogant
[40:38.360 --> 40:51.760]  slobs on every level but we know who they are so at least at least we know
[40:51.760 --> 40:58.240]  but Boehner and McConnell they are in there and there there needs to be
[40:58.240 --> 41:02.960]  special elections recalls we need to start recalls of Boehner and of McConnell
[41:02.960 --> 41:05.440]  because they're not going for impeachment they're not even trying to
[41:05.440 --> 41:11.040]  repeal I mean if they made Obama truly weak and cut off the funding and used
[41:11.040 --> 41:16.480]  hearings to expose all the crime to build momentum towards a true impeachment
[41:16.480 --> 41:20.160]  and reform they could fix the country but see the country's working just fine
[41:20.160 --> 41:24.720]  for them we're going into a North American union we're going into global
[41:24.720 --> 41:29.760]  governance they are selfishly selling out our children in our future because
[41:29.760 --> 41:34.520]  hey they're at the top of the heap they are traitors and they know what they're
[41:34.520 --> 41:43.360]  doing and they're so arrogant that they put out country music songs now the
[41:43.360 --> 41:49.440]  Hillary PAC does about how she loves family values oh there's this new video
[41:49.440 --> 41:52.560]  we played yesterday it was totally disgusting and then they've got Hillary
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.040]  outgoing I think we shouldn't have over borders and I think you do have a right
[41:56.040 --> 42:01.480]  to have guns I got a hanker in to have some wolf brand chili how long's it been
[42:01.480 --> 42:06.360]  since you had a big steaming bowl of Hillary Clinton baloney well that's
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.440]  too long yeah let's play part of this song where Hillary Clinton know we love
[42:12.440 --> 42:22.800]  you we came together in no way to find a moment we all can't celebrate no round
[42:22.800 --> 42:31.120]  having a meal sitting around the family and why can't we afford every child
[42:31.120 --> 42:47.360]  the glass ceiling that's right just vote for Hillary she's a woman that matters
[42:47.360 --> 43:03.700]  she's a lying crook she's a loving woman days weren't a couple of
[43:03.700 --> 43:31.760]  hattons red barn what is this stupid song called put out by Hillary pack this
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.620]  is meant for all the white trash Democrat women to feel good they have
[43:35.620 --> 43:45.140]  pride a woman's here cuz our American dream is at stake that actually follows
[43:45.140 --> 43:55.140]  common core cuz you got redneck ebonics brought to you by Jesse Jackson
[43:55.140 --> 44:01.540]  who's tough and got vision he rides off the can of gasoline subliminal athletes
[44:01.540 --> 44:10.940]  are gonna burn America down that guy clone of Joel Olsteen with a mullet
[44:13.340 --> 44:22.140]  she's a loving wife she's got a lot of girlfriends she's got more notches on
[44:22.140 --> 44:29.420]  her belt and more little darlin's man bill ever thought he could bill ain't
[44:29.420 --> 44:33.740]  gonna get to bring Sharon in the Lincoln bedroom
[44:33.740 --> 44:40.460]  Hillary's gonna keep that stop with young fillers all she needs your daughter's
[44:40.460 --> 44:46.980]  belong to her your guns do as well and if you like Janet Reno well you're
[44:46.980 --> 44:58.700]  gonna love Hillary all right yeah I absolutely love Hillary excuse me can
[44:58.700 --> 45:05.260]  we pull up team America what would you do all right I'm gonna stop right there
[45:05.260 --> 45:10.220]  I've already done that yesterday I need to quit right now while I'm ahead coming
[45:10.220 --> 45:13.580]  up watch out for that puddle soon it could be federally regulated that's
[45:13.580 --> 45:22.100]  right Bush and the CIA's ex-officials rebut torture report UNICEF calls 2014
[45:22.100 --> 45:26.100]  one of the worst years on record for the world's children I love how they
[45:26.100 --> 45:29.340]  always run the program to save the kids it's kind of like Prince Bernhardt of
[45:29.340 --> 45:33.420]  the Netherlands former Nazi founder the Bilderberg group got caught using the
[45:33.420 --> 45:41.460]  World Wildlife Fund that he founded as a front for poaching hilarious and to
[45:41.460 --> 45:45.780]  build secret military bases all over Africa and try to overthrow what Kenya
[45:45.780 --> 45:52.780]  was it yeah that's kind of like a Planned Parenthood's leading marches to quote
[45:52.780 --> 45:57.820]  respect black people and respect black lives Planned Parenthood founded by the
[45:57.820 --> 46:02.180]  Rockefellers on record with the express mission to kill every black person they
[46:02.180 --> 46:10.540]  could kind of like George Soros again gets awards from the ADO and then he goes
[46:10.540 --> 46:15.660]  on 60 minutes and admits that he was a collaborator helping find hidden Jews
[46:15.660 --> 46:21.980]  and turn them and their wealth over to be sent to places like Dachau and when
[46:21.980 --> 46:26.020]  he see they the clip used to be on on YouTube they expunge it everywhere
[46:26.020 --> 46:29.820]  like if somebody's got it send it to us it's in news articles but I cannot find
[46:29.820 --> 46:35.740]  it my horse my horse my kingdom for my horse Richard the third said my kingdom
[46:35.740 --> 46:42.780]  or at least a handshake for that clip because Soros is on there and they say
[46:42.780 --> 46:46.460]  well what responsibility you hold for helping round up people and do you feel
[46:46.460 --> 46:51.460]  bad he says no I don't feel bad and I have zero responsibility I did what I
[46:51.460 --> 47:00.500]  had to to survive and I'm glad I survived what a sociopathic psychopathic
[47:00.500 --> 47:04.540]  statement well it's not really psychopathic as a psycho isn't in reality
[47:04.540 --> 47:10.340]  a sociopath is but just cares about no one but themselves and he's the big
[47:10.340 --> 47:14.780]  liberal see and I know I bring that up every few months the fact about Soros
[47:14.780 --> 47:25.260]  it's just so bizarre but the Balkanization accelerates the Philly
[47:25.260 --> 47:27.820]  mayor says police officers are increasingly afraid of the community
[47:27.820 --> 47:39.900]  that's the plan we're going to also get into another fabricated jobs report and
[47:39.900 --> 47:46.220]  the different protests being organized by people like Roman manual in Chicago
[47:46.220 --> 47:49.180]  we're gonna look at why the administration is so determined to
[47:49.180 --> 47:59.020]  start a race war but before we go any further ladies and gentlemen I want to

[53:02.140 --> 53:06.180]  about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[53:06.180 --> 53:09.460]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[53:09.460 --> 53:12.620]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans
[53:12.620 --> 53:17.060]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by
[53:17.060 --> 53:21.620]  Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken a loan

[54:23.340 --> 54:28.700]  officers were hit by a car hundreds of students skipped school this week to
[54:28.700 --> 54:33.580]  protest the Ferguson decision four officers were hit and there are reports
[54:33.580 --> 54:36.940]  of students laughing and chanting hit them again
[54:36.940 --> 54:42.260]  Alicia Tunia following this story from our Denver newsroom Alicia hi John yes
[54:42.260 --> 54:46.980]  and these four officers were on bicycles at the time of the accident and one does
[54:46.980 --> 54:51.460]  remain in critical condition according to the last update from DPD officer John
[54:51.460 --> 54:54.660]  Adson a nine-year veteran of the department was escorting students from
[54:54.660 --> 54:58.660]  East High School in Denver who staged a walkout on one of the city's busiest
[54:58.660 --> 55:04.100]  streets Colfax Avenue witnesses say at one point a car accelerated went up on
[55:04.100 --> 55:08.820]  to the sidewalk and hit the Ford DPD officers dragging officer ad sit
[55:08.820 --> 55:13.340]  behind Denver police say the driver of that vehicle had a medical condition the
[55:13.340 --> 55:17.340]  police union and others say some in the crowd cheered the union issuing a
[55:17.340 --> 55:21.260]  statement saying immediately after the horrible accident yesterday injuring
[55:21.260 --> 55:25.380]  Ford Denver police officers several parties in the protesting group cheered
[55:25.380 --> 55:30.180]  and chanted hit him again these actions are not only reprehensible but quite
[55:30.180 --> 55:34.060]  possibly the most disturbing thing this association has ever heard let's stop
[55:34.060 --> 55:38.340]  right there I don't think it's the most disturbing thing you've ever heard I'm
[55:38.340 --> 55:41.940]  sure you've heard about you know dead kids in basements and stuff but it is
[55:41.940 --> 55:49.100]  very disturbing that random people would then see random cops run over and
[55:49.100 --> 55:55.860]  cheer it but that's just like our article up on info wars.com where police
[55:55.860 --> 56:02.020]  department mocks Garner who was choked to death with hashtag we can't breathe
[56:02.020 --> 56:07.820]  tweet defensive police action backfires on Indianapolis Department who has now
[56:07.820 --> 56:12.500]  deleted the tweet you can see the tweet and the response this is an us against
[56:12.500 --> 56:17.900]  them mentality and it's now being cast as racially based because the Democratic
[56:17.900 --> 56:24.500]  Party wants to be racially based. Is there profiling on black people in many
[56:24.500 --> 56:28.180]  cities probably I mean undoubtedly it goes on there's profiling against
[56:28.180 --> 56:32.780]  skaters there's profiling against hippies there are certain groups that the
[56:32.780 --> 56:39.340]  police have been trained to basically be scared of or to think are criminal
[56:39.980 --> 56:43.220]  namely it's people that aren't wearing suits and ties you want to be left one
[56:43.220 --> 56:46.900]  by the police wear a sports jacket and and drive a nice car is that
[56:46.900 --> 56:51.580]  discriminatory against poor people I think so but if you go to a job interview
[56:51.580 --> 56:57.140]  wearing a dirty t-shirt versus a sports jacket with a tie and versus being
[56:57.140 --> 57:04.140]  polite not being polite just saying thank you just opening doors for people will
[57:04.140 --> 57:07.420]  make you more successful because than other successful people will think you're
[57:07.420 --> 57:14.060]  higher quality but see a lot of poor folks today especially think it's cool to
[57:14.060 --> 57:18.900]  not be thankful and cool to be rude and and cool to not dress nice and that's
[57:18.900 --> 57:23.380]  been done by the MTV culture and social engineering to create a permanent
[57:23.380 --> 57:29.460]  giant swelling underclass or it's not cool to be successful it's not cool to
[57:29.460 --> 57:33.780]  have a job it's not cool to stay out of the system it's cool to be in the system
[57:33.780 --> 57:38.380]  that's when you're bonafide well the system engineered it that way then they
[57:38.380 --> 57:42.780]  train the police you're the enemy then you act like the enemy and it's a
[57:42.780 --> 57:54.060]  self-fulfilling prophecy that's what I'm getting it and I think it's equally
[57:54.060 --> 57:57.940]  disgusting to cheer people being run over or to cheer someone being choked to
[57:57.940 --> 58:04.460]  death even if Garner deserved it which he clearly didn't it would have been
[58:04.460 --> 58:08.040]  despicable to make fun of his death begging for his life saying I can't
[58:08.040 --> 58:14.500]  breathe while they had his arm pinned in a move where you can't roll over and
[58:14.500 --> 58:19.980]  it's going to be killer cops psychos that are going to cause a lot of innocent
[58:19.980 --> 58:23.220]  police to get killed in this country because when the Civil War really kicks
[58:23.220 --> 58:29.060]  off which we've been predicting for a long time as their goal it's going to
[58:29.060 --> 58:33.660]  be devastating and I am not gonna enjoy watching citizens and the police kill
[58:33.660 --> 58:41.020]  each other while the globalists sit offshore and laugh stay with us thank

[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:14.100]  it
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.860]  William Benny he's just four miles from Fort Meade headquarters of the NSA where
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:22.740]  he was the technical leader and director for intelligence with the NSA
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:27.820]  before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001 after more than 30 years with the
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:33.300]  agency Benny has been described as one of the most prolific and best analysts
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:37.540]  and code breakers in NSA history Benny continues to speak out about the NSA's
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:41.260]  illegal data collection policies and continues interviews in the media
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:45.060]  regarding his experiences and communications intercepts by government
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:50.020]  agencies of American citizens in a legal case Benny has testified in affidavit
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:56.380]  that the NSA is in deliberate violation of the US Constitution expose facts.org
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:02.180]  whistleblower.org and he's part of the government accountability movement and
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:07.500]  we really appreciate him spending so much time with us he's just as I guess
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:14.180]  fifth visit with info wars his third visit on this radio show remember they
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:18.100]  would always say the NSA was not spying on American citizens and talking to a
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:21.940]  lot of other whistleblowers and people from Wayne Madsen right through for all
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:30.380]  intents and purposes that was the case until 9-11 and Benny's testified to
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:35.180]  that now they're listening and watching and controlling and and grabbing almost
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:40.020]  everything now it's totally illegal and it's being used politically that
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:45.940]  spying on Congress it's just over the top it's like living in a glass house but
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:49.620]  then oh the group's doing it they're totally secretive so you go to jail for
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:56.860]  espionage if you go spy on the CIA or NSA but if they do it oh well it's okay
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:03.940]  and I asked mr. Benny what he wanted to get into first and it's the fact that the
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:09.420]  courts have been rubber stamping this I mean there won't even be a need for
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.860]  courts soon with all this and you know they've caught with parallel
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:17.100]  construction these other agencies like the DEA creating fake investigations to
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.500]  claim they got evidence one way when they got it illegally another and then
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.540]  these agencies have all been caught planting evidence physically at the
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:29.460]  crime lab at the FBI we've had the former head of the crime lab on Dr. White
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.700]  Hurst many times was getting back on haven't been on years to digital
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:41.940]  fingerprints being planted so this is a tool of total social control in his
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.580]  words and that London Guardian headline and William Benny joins us I wanted to
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.940]  get into the biggest threats the breaking news how private industry is part
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:54.660]  of this ways we can try to stop this and then I want to open the phones up we'll
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.020]  give out a hashtag here in a few minutes where you can tweet at real Alex Jones on
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:03.980]  Twitter and you can then send your questions in that I'll also read on
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.100]  there for William Benny but I'll give the number out coming up in about 20
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.540]  minutes and that's your chance we'd love to hear from you to call in with a
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:17.340]  quick question or comment for William Benny expose facts dot org whistleblower
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:22.220]  dot org again thank you so much mr. Benny for coming on the show well thank
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:25.660]  you for having me you've got the floor get into what's happened with these
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:32.060]  judges well it's it's it's it's basically a continuation of what's
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:36.740]  happened in the Supreme Court when when the government gets boxed into a
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:40.660]  corner where they're threatened by the test of a constitutionality if any of
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:44.460]  the programs they're running they lie to the courts and the courts are letting
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:49.460]  them get away with it for example in in Amnesty International versus Clapper
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.020]  that case that case was at the Supreme Court when the solicitor general lied to
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.940]  the court saying that well if any NSA data was going to be used against an
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:02.660]  individual either in court or anywhere else that the individual would be told
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:07.860]  so that they could contest the basically it's the right to to contest
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:13.700]  discovery that is of information that is libelous or otherwise criminal implying
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:18.180]  criminal activity on the part of the individual so but that was a lie nobody
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.220]  had been told even when we talked to the president's civil liberties oversight
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:26.620]  board several months ago we talked about that and raised that issue and they
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.980]  said well from now on all of those all the people where that data is being used
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:36.540]  will be told well I mean that that right there I mean and we still have no
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.820]  guarantee that any anybody anywhere has ever been told and by the fact that
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.940]  they're giving us assurances how can you trust them I mean after what they've
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:50.340]  been doing lying to us outright how can you trust what they're saying you can't
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:54.980]  and so there's no real over there's no real oversight in government there's no
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.660]  checks and balances anymore they don't work and and that's that's the fun that's
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:03.220]  the fundamental problem with our government bar our whole process is
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:08.260]  failing us and the courts seem to be going along with it they that is if I
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:11.460]  were on the Supreme Court and the Solicitor General did that to me and I
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:15.620]  found out about it the first thing I would do would be to reinstate that case
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:20.580]  back in the court I mean after all you don't you don't permit perjury to let
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:25.420]  you get rid of us a genuine concern of the public I mean that's what they're
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.020]  doing they're allowing perjury by the government to determine what in fact is
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:34.900]  is tested in the courts in terms of constitutionality and that's that's it
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:42.100]  that's in my book that is what treason is all about you're fundamentally going
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.740]  after the foundations of this government and corrupting it that to me is real
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:55.700]  treason well it certainly is treason and and now if they're able to do this then
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:00.300]  the sky's the limit what comes next I mean it's just a total overthrow of our
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:06.100]  system please continue well I mean that's the whole point it's a total
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:10.620]  destruction of any of the rights you thought you had under the Constitution I
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:18.300]  mean it's simply a matter of we no longer have a Constitution and that's the
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.260]  real problem that I see I think we you know we need to stand up I mean I can't
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:26.820]  understand why these judges on these courts can actually look themselves in
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:30.740]  the eye when they shave in the morning I mean after all they they know what the
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.460]  law is they should know they know the Fourth Amendment says you don't have
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:38.540]  data the government doesn't have data on a US citizen unless you state the
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:42.980]  citizens name the day to your after and also show probable cause of why you're
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.500]  going at it and where you're going to get it now all that none of that is
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.660]  happening with the hundreds of millions of US citizens that they're
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.500]  collecting data on none of that sure and the argument is well we're doing this to
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:59.420]  stop bad guys but the truth is well well exactly they're using it to
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:03.620]  consolidate the takeover well from your expert view what is it really being used
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:10.500]  for sir well it's being it's being used to set up the way and means to control
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.220]  the population I mean I call NSA is a central repository of knowledge on the
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:19.900]  US citizens and everybody else in the planet by the way for for the US
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:23.420]  government all departments of the US government so I've been referring to it
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:29.300]  as the new Stasi agency because that's exactly what the Stasi did they had
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:33.780]  files on everyone and they wanted then they had people spying on the right and
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.740]  left you know even your neighbors would find you well that's what's happening
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.820]  internally in NSA now they're talking about having people say if you see
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.420]  something say something that's the kind of thing they're talking about
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:49.540]  internally in NSA now well I mean you know that's that's the Stasi in spades I
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:56.340]  mean Tom Drake was over in in Germany a year or two ago and he met up with an
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:00.980]  older couple an older German couple and they said to him they said well you know
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:09.940]  we that we the Germans we are a post fascist state and we know it but you you
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:16.300]  are you are in fact a pre-fascist state and don't even know that so I mean the
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:21.180]  point is we have to wake up here what do you do though when you're faced with
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.780]  true tyranny this is classical tyranny not just with the warrantless ubiquitous
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:32.220]  omnipresent spy grid but the fact that major corporations have lined up to
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:38.700]  seamlessly Trojan horse surveillance into every device into our cars taxed by
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:44.500]  the miles coming out all the smart meters spying all the new appliances with
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.140]  the former CIA director bragging that you're washing machine you know will
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:53.700]  listen to you this is already going on and it's becoming ubiquitous and then
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:58.500]  it's being used illegally and it's being used to rig markets rig the stock
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:04.900]  market I mean this is really a 21st century takeover yes it is and that's
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:09.020]  something that we need to all stand up and object to I mean if we don't it's
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:12.380]  going to happen to us if you don't stand up if it's like to the squeaky wheel
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.620]  gets the oil well if you don't become the squeaky wheel you don't you don't get
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:21.460]  satisfaction anywhere certainly not in a in our in our you can't really call what
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:27.020]  we have now a clear democracy because after all it's more like a police date
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:33.020]  William Benny a former director and leader for intelligence with the NSA
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:38.820]  joins us the biggest whistleblower in NSA history hands down but he's just

[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.620]  basically a number two three or four deposition depending on how you look at
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:28.860]  it a major director of the NSA here with us today so there are good people from
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:33.780]  the system telling the truth but there are so many but mainstream media tries
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:38.500]  to ignore them or vilify them or demonize them I want to talk about the
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:47.700]  morale at the NSA listeners can tweet at hashtag NSA insider capitalized NSA and
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:52.420]  then lower caps insider hashtag NSA insider for your questions those are
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:25:02.860]  coming up in the next segment toll free number to join us 800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:07.340]  your chance to talk to a very honorable person in my view has a lot of
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:12.860]  courage and sacrifice their career to try to defend our republic and who worked
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:16.300]  at the NSA trying to defend us from foreign enemies which is what it was
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.300]  set up for William what about the morale of the NSA from your view and what
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:25.260]  about your former colleagues what are they saying to you a and then be tell
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:28.420]  folks a little bit about the persecution you've gone through just to
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:34.380]  understand the level of tyranny we're dealing with well I think I don't talk
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.420]  directly to anybody that works at NSA still simply because if I did you know
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.820]  I'm buying the target I have been for quite a while so they would they would
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:49.060]  of course be targeted by the FBI and interrogated and by FBI and internal
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:55.220]  security at NSA so I don't I don't do that to them but I I know that they
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:26:01.260]  instituted programs that that get the agency employees to spy on one another
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:06.020]  which simply means that it's like the it's just like East Germany I mean you
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:09.540]  got your neighbors are spying on you and here with your neighbors you're working
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:14.500]  with and trying to do the job that's a very hostile environment no one could
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:19.140]  you're basically shaking the trust of individuals that trying to do a job
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:23.380]  internally in the in the government I mean that makes it very that makes a
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:32.420]  very unhealthy atmosphere to work in I mean that's that's simply that's simply
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.620]  unproductive it destroys initiative and so on because nobody wants to do
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.260]  anything for fear that's only let's think it's something wrong and so they'll
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.340]  get they'll get informed on and be interrogated that's the way it was in
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:46.060]  East Germany that's why they're their whole society stagnated so that's been
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.260]  that's a real counterproductive process for them to set up and I know internally
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:56.700]  that people from who have retired from NSA come through the retirement chain we
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:01.460]  get the word back from from them saying basically that there's an awful lot of
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.340]  people there are kind of upset at what they're doing at spying on domestically
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:10.420]  and so but they're so afraid to do anything because they've looked at what
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:16.300]  they've done to us which gets into your follow-on point there they they they in
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:21.540]  order to try to silence anybody from objecting internally in NSA what they
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:27.140]  did was they threatened us with the persecution and up to 35 years in jail
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:35.780]  you know using the 1917 espionage act which we at that time were simply we
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.060]  were all staying at the point the only one who was outside the government
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:43.780]  complaining about it was was Tom Drake and he was talking to the Baltimore Sun
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.980]  but he didn't really send anything classified and that was that was agreed
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:52.060]  to by the government in court so so they were really coming after us just to
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:56.780]  shut us down from from exposing the corruption fraud waste abuse that was
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:28:03.700]  going on as well as all of the unconstitutional activity so and they
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:09.340]  used the FBI first to raid us and take all our property and threaten us with
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:18.340]  guns some of us directly and and the the the the follow-on was the the
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:23.860]  Department of Justice used all their power to try to indict us and put us in
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:28.420]  jail so that we so that we would you know be out of sight and out of mind
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:33.940]  permanently so to speak literal political prisoners yeah and of course you I
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:39.660]  mean describe you come up being raided at gunpoint what was that like well it's
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:45.740]  kind of you know it's kind of it's really strange to be coming out of your
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:49.500]  shower in the morning and have somebody pointing a gun at you so you look at the
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.580]  end of a barrel of a pistol as you're coming out of the shower having no
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:57.220]  idea why they're doing this to you I mean after all we were trying to work
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:00.140]  within the government all the way up to them but they just didn't want us doing
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:03.340]  it that's all it was just too embarrassing they didn't want anybody in
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.100]  government to know what they were doing and that's important too because they
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:10.900]  get back that checks and balances now if that's the case you know how how can any

[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:32.260]  bring it back never did okay enough of that William Benning I want to go to
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:37.860]  these calls I want to have you be able to speak to any topic you wish but to
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:42.260]  imagine you with all these commendations and metals you have you know
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:48.100]  called by Nightline and other operations one of the most successful
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:52.380]  code breakers and scientists ever helping defend this country against the
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:58.620]  Soviets and terror groups and many others what is it like when you got rated go
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.660]  back to that and describe the persecution that goes on when you weren't
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:07.700]  even going public at that time to try to basically imply that you were a bad
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:11.820]  guy so they could disappear you down the road I mean if they can get William
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:17.300]  Benning they can go after anybody and then I want to get your view on Snowden
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:23.020]  and he says that a revelations coming out that would bring down the political
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:26.820]  system or he said be careful I have a revelation that would bring you down
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:35.340]  well what type of revelation could that be William Benning well I he may
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:40.380]  simply be talking about like for example CIA was filing spying on
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:46.740]  Feinstein's intelligence committee when they were preparing that report again
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:51.620]  on terror the report she's trying to get out here recently I think if they
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.660]  look a little closer they'll find out that that's buying is much more
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:59.460]  extensive than they even think so in other words I think if they looked
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:04.780]  fairly closely I mean Russ Tice has said this for several years now that they
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:10.180]  have been spying on senators house of representatives judges of the Supreme
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:15.900]  Court even in the White House and also also generals and other federal judges
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:19.460]  and so on so they're looking they're spying the spying network that we've
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:22.820]  created inside this country is actually spying on the leadership of this
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:26.620]  country the ones that have power over them so that they know what their
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:30.980]  position is and can adjust accordingly you know and prepare for it so that's
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:34.220]  what they're doing I mean they're they're spying on everybody our
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:38.540]  leadership in this country as well as everybody else on the planet so this is
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:44.660]  this is an uncontrollable these are uncontrollable agencies they cannot
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:48.260]  they have no they have no way of verifying anything they're doing and
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:51.820]  they let them continue that way when in fact they should all stand up the
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:56.140]  problem is you don't know and they don't know the house of representatives and
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.820]  senators they don't know what kind of evidence the intelligence community has
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:05.100]  accumulated about them and their and their activity is it something like J.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:11.020]  Edgar Hoover had over the entire Congress he used that power too and it was
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:15.020]  actually the power he had wasn't that he may not have known anything about you
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:20.340]  but you may think he did and that that gave him power over you so but he
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:25.020]  certainly knew a lot about the the leadership in Washington we also know
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:29.580]  those files were a form of internal governmental defamation and slander and
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:34.300]  libel because they were also filled with disinformation and garbage and that
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:39.340]  goes to my next question what about the problem of planted data through the
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:47.180]  system I mean we know that goes on well I mean yes that that plus and in our case
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:51.620]  at least in the cases that we had we knew they were fabricating data like and
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:57.380]  in Tom Drake's case when they when they indicted him the data that they had
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:01.940]  there was fabricated it was it was retroactively classified and then he was
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:05.780]  charged for having classified material well I mean that's that's that's that's
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:09.900]  like framing him I mean that's that's a felony and these people should go to
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:16.060]  jail for that even even Thomas Tam back in 2003 when he was he was the lawyer in
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:19.500]  the Department of Justice that was the source of the New York Times article on
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:25.100]  warrantless wiretapping and when he when he was his job at the Department of
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:29.980]  Justice was to prepare the warrant request for the FISA court the secret
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:34.620]  court and so when he was going through that he was he was discovering that they
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.180]  had wiretaps already on people that they hadn't gone through the FISA court to
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:44.860]  get well that that that by by definition or by law at the time was a was a
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:48.420]  violation that was a federal felony in other words if you didn't if you didn't
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:53.180]  have a FISA approved warrant to get a wiretap on a US citizen for the
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:57.940]  intelligence community then then then you in fact were at were committing a
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:01.540]  federal felony and they were doing that by the thousands and never got in
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:06.540]  trouble was it that really part of a larger parallel construction where they
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:11.220]  only go get the warrant later once they want to go back and claim that they got
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.780]  the information with a warrant yeah that's that was all part of that and that
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:23.140]  that had been going on since at least 2001 since after 9-11 and and director
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:27.100]  Mueller of the FBI said they were using that program stellar wind which is the
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.900]  domestic spying program he said they were using it since 9-11 in 2001 which
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:37.580]  is October which is when they created that the late the name stellar wind
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:42.140]  William Benny top NSA whistleblowers our guest I mean I'm just a layperson but
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:47.340]  correct me if I'm wrong a when you start snooping on everybody you create
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:53.020]  giant troughs of information that could be stolen hacked or taken b you're
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:57.940]  focusing on so much that you miss the real threats that are specific and can
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:02.140]  be tracked and focused in on so you blind yourself in a way having too much
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:05.340]  data it's like having a billion phone messages you can't listen to any of them
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:10.180]  basically and then see and I think this is probably the most important it
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:15.420]  creates a whole system of blackmail domestically and will convert you to a
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:20.580]  tyranny so so it's it's like suicide I mean what did Congress think it's already
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:27.540]  come out for decades they use the NSA the British NSA GCHQ to spy on
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:32.380]  Parliament and and and now they're using all this data on each other and it
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:37.500]  just I mean why would the political elite create such a thing and think that
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:42.500]  they could control it that's exactly right they think and that then and the
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:46.620]  point is that what it means is you're giving all this knowledge and power to
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:50.020]  a set of individuals that aren't controlled and and they're sooner or
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.220]  later if they use it I mean that's that's just human nature to have that
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.820]  happen so I mean you know it's only a matter of time like you say is to win
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:01.220]  how long it's going to take them to take advantage of all the data they've
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:06.860]  gotten so I mean it's just a it's just a very bad situation a very bad path that
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:12.740]  we've chosen to take here down the dark side with Dick Cheney sometimes you got
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.900]  to work on the dark side to quote Dick Cheney yeah that guys found that clip if
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:20.620]  you can well that's what's so crazy about this information's power and they've
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.580]  taught so many people in public school and in colleges and TV that oh you don't
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:28.020]  have anything to hide don't worry about it well why not have a glass house why
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:32.900]  not leave your codes to your computer out publicly no we all know that bad
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:36.180]  people will take advantage of that information well it's the same thing
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:41.180]  with government or corporations what about corporations I see them almost as
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.780]  a bigger threat now because they're all in a race with government to be the
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:50.700]  ultimate spy I mean isn't Google really the ultimate spy in the final equation
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:56.260]  I think part of the problem with their with their mining of Gmail is getting
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:44:00.820]  close to what the government's doing but they don't have the resources to see
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:04.660]  that part of the problem is that Google doesn't have all the data access that
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:10.060]  NSA does for example NSA can get into any business activity like banking or
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:14.140]  travel or anything like that and Google doesn't really have access to all that
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:18.100]  it also doesn't have access to all the all the emails they have they have a
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:22.580]  good number but they don't have all of them and and they don't also have the
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:27.060]  cooperation of other companies around the world and corporations to give them
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:31.860]  the wiretaps to get the transactional relationships between people but the
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:35.900]  not all of it anyway I mean they certainly have a great deal of it but
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:39.660]  it's not that it's not to the degree that government is so government brings it
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:44.740]  all together and in the darkness binds it right right and the point is that
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:49.260]  the that Google doesn't and companies do not have the power that government does
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:55.700]  when it comes to arresting people or you know putting them in jail or fabricating
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:59.780]  evidence or framing them like they've tried to do that so I mean there's quite
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:04.900]  a bit of difference between government and and at least in terms power and
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:12.540]  capability I want to go to some phone calls for William Benny here and also
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:17.060]  go through this huge list of Twitter questions that we have let's go ahead and
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:22.820]  talk to Joseph in Texas Joseph you're on the air with William Benny
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:29.900]  hi I wanted to call in and talk to you guys about I'm a hairdresser in Dallas
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:35.300]  and I had a client for a little while this year who was a he was a VP for the
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:42.140]  manufacturer that created the NSA Center in Utah and he gave me a lot of you know
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:45.140]  he told me as much as I guess he could about when they were building it and
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:50.620]  about this data center and I also have another friend of mine who just recently
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:55.700]  met who's he works with AT&T on the neural networks collecting the data so I
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:46:01.180]  want to ask some questions just see if you know I get an answer from him I was
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:06.740]  basically told just that the NSA data center you know that was that you know
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:11.100]  they were spying on you know everything from our cell phones to our banks
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:14.420]  everything connecting at all you know and after I heard that I actually heard
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:18.700]  a documentary with you know from it's like the operation stellar wind
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:25.340]  documentary and I just wanted to hear about that Mr. Benny yeah that's the
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:29.500]  that's the whole point is why they had to build Bluffdale with all that story I
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:34.700]  mean it wasn't for metadata it was for content of communications you know like
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:39.420]  all of your emails and phone conversation recordings and transcripts and
[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:43.540]  things like that I mean the point is if you wanted to if you wanted to put
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:48.100]  together all of the relationships of everybody in the world on metadata
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:51.540]  relationships and build those kind of what they're called graphs or simply
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:56.260]  social networks everybody in every domain phone calls emails banking all of
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:01.540]  that then you could do that and store in there in a room 20 foot by 40 foot
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:06.220]  that's all it would take to store all the relationships and all the domains of
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:11.860]  everybody in the world so and you could keep it there for I mean you know 50
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:18.040]  years perhaps something like that and so the real point was the hundreds of
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.820]  thousands of square feet of storage was needed for the content and that's where
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:25.380]  the bulk of data is that's where the bulk of information is and that's what
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:31.100]  it that's what takes an awful lot of storage up the rest of it is not doesn't
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:35.300]  take that much story that's right in Utah and Texas that's a key point when
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:38.380]  they lie and say we're just keeping metadata they consider everything to be
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:43.820]  metadata it's a lawyer's game they're playing thank you Joseph let's go ahead
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:47.500]  and take another call let's talk to Dominique in California you're on the
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:54.700]  ear hey there William I got a question about who they're kind of watching now
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:48:00.460]  I've videotaped jet laying some geoengineering trails out the other day
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:06.020]  and some webs started falling from the trail and I got it all on tape and I
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:10.660]  got a lot of samples of these webs falling from the sky and my question is
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:15.380]  are they monitoring geoengineering activists such as myself because I've
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:19.140]  been telling a lot of people about this and trying to get the word out there
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:22.100]  I'm kind of getting a little worried well I don't think you heard him
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:25.940]  everything's being recorded and monitored and now I don't think they
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:29.980]  mind that it's out as a chilling effect it's illegal what they're doing we need
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:34.820]  to stop it but it doesn't intimidate me and doesn't shut down my speech William
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:37.580]  Benny do you have any information I think you Dominique do you have any
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:42.860]  information on geoengineering climate manipulation well I I would think that
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:45.980]  that's one of the things there they're certainly monitoring all kinds of
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:50.780]  research done around the world before example one of the best ways to find out
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:56.740]  who's working on quantum computing is to for example go to go to a quantum
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:01.300]  computing conference around the world and just to just go around and collect
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:06.060]  business cards and you find that that sets up a community and then you work
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:09.380]  the transactional relationships you're getting across the network to build
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:12.540]  their social network of who they're working with to work on so quantum
[01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:16.260]  computing and I'm sure that they would do the same thing for any kind of
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:24.580]  climate alterations and so on I mean any kind of a serious research that's
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:29.020]  going on that would have implications on a wider scale they certainly would be
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:35.140]  monitoring just to watch to make sure they knew what was happening thank you
[01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:39.100]  so much let's go to Julio in Wyoming
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:43.220]  Merry Christmas Merry Christmas to you all it's funny mr. Benny you mentioned
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:46.820]  about collecting business cards and going to those conferences that caller
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:50.420]  that mentioned geoengineering that's what I've done mr. Benny I've gone to
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:56.580]  these conferences collected business cards spoke to people in geoengineering
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:50:00.420]  and I agree people need to do that I want to mention this document briefly
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:05.700]  before I get to my question I think it's cute the NSA is trying to attract
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:11.180]  children through their change the world program which includes solving fun
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:16.020]  puzzles and exploring the world of cryptology I think that's kind of cute
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:20.340]  with the change the world program you mentioned about blackmail you know it's
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:26.740]  it's it's quite clear bureaucracies and totalitarian agencies like the NSA are
[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:32.340]  using blackmail to their advantage my question is how how deep does that
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:36.740]  rabbit hole go and I spoke to someone who's a contractor in Colorado Springs
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:43.220]  last week who told me there's a lot of movement from these types of agencies
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:46.980]  moving towards Colorado Springs and other parts sure that's where the alternate
[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:50.140]  government space thank you for the call that's that's a lot of questions there
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.020]  but blackmail you already spoke to that but what else can you tell us about
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:59.060]  blackmail William Benny well the problem of course is that once you have all that
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:02.620]  data that's the power that that data gives you I mean if you have information
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:07.780]  like let me use an example I was on the Elliott Spitzer show on current TV when
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:12.700]  he was on the show on the show there and you know he was he was at I mean he
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:18.020]  never told me this but I've been I've been inference that through him I mean he
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:24.020]  he was after the bankers after the 2008 banking fiasco a lot of people lost a
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:28.020]  lot of money there and that was because of fraudulent solicitations by the banks
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:33.100]  passing around packaged mortgage groups and things like that you know and and so
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:37.380]  he was going after them criminally he was I think the governor of New York State
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:43.940]  at the time and and as a part of that why all of a sudden the FBI was going
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:49.540]  through all of his emails and his trans my financial transactions and so on and
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:55.420]  they found they found a where he was engaged with the prostitute and they
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:52:01.260]  used that to get rid of him and so the point is that the FBI didn't even show
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:04.540]  probable cause to why they were doing it the probable cause was they wanted him
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:09.140]  stopping they didn't want him criminally prosecuting the bankers in Wall Street
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:13.620]  that's what that's what the that's what the whole motive was and so the people
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:19.100]  who did that I mean Mueller was the director of FBI at the time and Alexander
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:25.180]  was the director of NSA so the FBI went into the database of emails that Mueller
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:29.820]  testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had access to back in
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:33.940]  the 30th of March of 2011 he testified at the Senate Judiciary Committee that he
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:37.740]  had access to this database where he could make a query and get all past and
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:41.620]  all future emails they came in on a person well I mean when the when the FBI
[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:45.820]  goes into all those back emails I mean looking at data for example against
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:51.580]  that betrayist I mean Ellie spitzer to get rid of him by then they were the
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:56.740]  ones who helped the bankers out to get keep them out of trouble so then you
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:02.260]  have Mueller and and Alexander after they retire and they're selling their
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:07.060]  expertise in cybersecurity and who are they selling it to a rate of 600,000 a
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:10.540]  month or something like that originally it started at a million but now they're
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:15.140]  selling that to I believe the last I heard it was the bankers well you know
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:19.020]  to me that's when I took contract law under government I mean the one of the
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:22.660]  first things you made sure you did not do was to give the appearance of a
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:27.060]  conflict of interest now that sure smells like a conflict of interest sure
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:30.100]  you've got a select group of banks to control the Federal Reserve that already
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:33.340]  issue and control the currency now they're using the NSA that they help
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:38.100]  government build to domestically target everybody steal data corner the
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:42.820]  markets and just take everything over and get rid of people they were trying
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:47.580]  to hold you accountable it's a criminal takeover there's no debating it right
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:55.060]  ex-zack to mount ass that's his quitter name ask William Benny what does mr.
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:54:02.580]  Benny think about people waking up to spying but also the smart TVs that of
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:06.020]  those that don't know Samsung admits that they quote record what you say in
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:09.800]  your house and send it to third parties for quote marketing what do you think of
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:17.260]  just the main lining of total spying I mean for me that that that is an
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:21.060]  intrusion and an authorized intrusion and to follow me and they should be
[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:28.100]  charged and criminally with it havoc on Twitter ask how closely does Canada's
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:36.420]  CSE work with the NSA or is it more a data sharing agreement actually this
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:40.100]  has been documented it's in some of the documentation that Snowden that get
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:46.140]  provided and it's been published they are basically the it's a it's an outgrowth
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:50.500]  of the World War two effort of the English-speaking countries that's the
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:56.220]  UK the US Canada Australia and New Zealand now the US is called first party
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:55:00.060]  and the other four are called second party that that was the closest
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:03.820]  relationship in history in World War two they worked common they worked
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:10.460]  together jointly on breaking enigma codes and also the the Japanese purple
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:16.260]  code and the JN 25 naval code and those those relationships only only expanded
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:20.060]  from there and the the cooperation that's been very close it's the closest
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:26.260]  cooperating group of countries in the world Mikhail failing info wars comm
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:30.180]  rider at Mikhail failing on Twitter ask others have mentioned power struggle
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:35.780]  between the NSA and other Intel grips such as the CIA can you expand on that
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:43.220]  a hashtag NSA insider yet there always was I mean even before 9-11 I mean that
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:46.940]  was part of the I think the 9-11 Commission's report was they need to
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:50.860]  work a little closer and be a little less rivalry kind of they can reduce the
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:57.020]  rivalry the point is that there are certain charters that these agencies
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:56:01.780]  have like the CIA is to do human the NSA is to do SIG and signals intelligence
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:05.460]  and they tell us we guard their their charters and if they come up with
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:09.540]  information in their in their areas that that's like knowledge they have that
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:13.260]  they can directly provide to senior leadership the president and so on for
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:18.660]  decision-making so that makes them that that gives them the sense that they
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:23.500]  are they have greater influence in the government and what it does and what the
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:28.940]  president would decide to do by being bagged by being able to control or to
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:33.940]  have the most significant intelligence information to present so that creates a
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:39.300]  rivalry between the agencies and that's been going on for decades I mean that's
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:45.500]  nothing new the CIA does it NSA does it they all do it so to a certain degree
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:51.420]  and that that was part of the problem that the 9-11 Commission you know yeah
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:56.780]  that's certainly that's certainly an issue a rivalry between these agencies
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:02.460]  is one that is a fundamental flaw or capable that destroys some of the
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:07.140]  capabilities that they should and have in terms of sharing knowledge so that
[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:12.300]  everybody can be leveraging the same set of information William Benny we have
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:18.620]  another question for her from Twitter fw partica ask how would you change the
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:25.140]  NSA so it would be a positive department first of all I mean we submitted
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:28.980]  21 recommendations of the president of the United States in January this year
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:34.900]  it's an open letter it's on the it's on the web and those those recommendations
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:40.020]  the two primary points in that with those recommendations one was to do the
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:46.420]  force NSA to make a a directed selection of information unknown targets and
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:51.820]  things in a zone of suspicion defined around it so that would mean that they
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:58.740]  would only pull in maybe they would let 99.99999% of the data passed by and
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:03.620]  only pull out and store that data that was relevant to targets that they they
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:08.460]  were after I'm gonna blow up the Eiffel Tower that would be grabbed that that
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:11.780]  would focus them in on their targets and that would make a rich environment for
[01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:15.540]  their analysts to succeed and we would actually be able to stop things like the
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:20.780]  Boston bombing or even 9-11 I mean they had all the data to stop 9-11 they just

[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:23.340]  alex jones
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:36.740]  so I have to work those sort of the dark side if you will we're gonna spend time
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:41.420]  in the shadows and in the intelligence world a lot of what needs to be done here
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:45.860]  will have to be done quietly without any discussion using sources and methods
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:50.140]  that are available to our intelligence agencies if we're gonna be successful
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:55.940]  that's the world these folks operate in and so it's gonna be vital for us to to
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.740]  use any means that are disposable but a disposal basically to achieve our
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:04.220]  objective and now all kind of is bigger than it's ever been and it's renamed
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:08.620]  ISIS and our own government funded it and William Benny was beginning to get
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:15.540]  into 9-11 and I've had Colonel Schaefer on I've had C. Bell Edmonds on I've had
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:21.420]  the translators the kernels I've had so many angles of this covering classified
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:25.860]  and unclassified information and leaked information that we know they knew
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:31.100]  about 9-11 and bare minimum stood down six of the ten commissioners have said
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:35.540]  that William Benny without giving out any classified information obviously what
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:44.140]  can you tell us about 9-11 well it's it's more like after after not after we
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:50.180]  left NSA because of the domestic spying why it Tom Drake who was still there
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:57.860]  working ran a program we were developing to on the entire database in NSA and he
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:02.980]  found all the data that was necessary to stop 9-11 in their databases prior to
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:08.740]  9-11 which simply meant very simply put that they they could easily have stopped
[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:14.300]  9-11 if they were doing smart things but what was driving them at the time
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.980]  well it was a matter of getting more and more money and building a bigger
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:22.380]  budget and that's really what their emphasis was on so they didn't they
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:25.300]  weren't trying to do smart things they were trying to do things that would
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:31.260]  build their empire and that that to me is why I keep saying every time I give a
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:35.180]  talk anywhere I keep saying they traded the security of the people of the United
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:45.660]  States and up the world for money and I guess when you make multi-million dollar
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:50.660]  purchases from big tech firms for their supercomputers and fiber optic and
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:55.700]  cables and you end up getting nice president jobs a few years later with
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:03:01.180]  that revolving door it just turns into a giant boondoggle yeah that's that
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:05.260]  incestuous relationship that exists between government officials and the
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:12.220]  private industry that that close relationship building between them so
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:17.540]  that they can move from one one in senior executive job in government to a
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:22.700]  senior executive job in industry what do you think about moves to cut off the
[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:30.180]  electricity and the water supply in Utah to the data center well I mean they
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:33.860]  could certainly try to do that but I would think that they would call up the
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:37.660]  National Guard nationalize things and go in and and make sure that they could
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:43.500]  continue to keep the power going it's to me the more important way to attack this
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:48.500]  problem is to go after them legally by the voting and by getting rid of them
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:53.740]  and firing their their worthless personages from Congress well you would
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:58.260]  think that there would be rolling this back with all the lies coming out that
[02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:01.820]  they were deceptive and they're using it against Congress but instead like you
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:04.380]  said they're just getting the courts lined up to legalize it right and
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:07.380]  they're feeling more confident because some of those some of the judges are
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:12.620]  getting behind them and backing it and I think that's through fear as well right
[02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:16.340]  you never know what kind of blackmail they have on those judges because of the
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:21.300]  collection of data they've got the word is is that Justice Roberts was being
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:26.060]  blackmailed on the Obamacare situation yeah well that could be I mean after all
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:31.220]  he did change the way he changed it from a penalty to a tax and that's changing
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:34.500]  the law and he should have thrown that back to Congress for the Congress to fix
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:40.900]  that not not the court yeah the fix is in yeah wow final segment with

[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:24.140]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones. It's our
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:29.700]  final segment with top NSA whistleblower William Benning they tried to charge him
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:34.220]  the SWAT team rated him you name it when he was just trying to quietly legally
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:40.460]  work through the federal government and Congress to try to stop the illegal
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:46.700]  spying they instead tried to throw him in prison for it and many others it's a
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:50.660]  testament that we still got some justice in the court systems but not much
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:55.020]  that he and others have escaped prison others haven't they've been trying to
[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:59.700]  put journalists in jail that talked to somebody at the defense department at a
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:04.540]  press conference about North Korea and they say well we don't want you getting
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:10.300]  the opinion that we don't think or we do think they have nukes we're gonna arrest
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:16.340]  you I mean this is really a major power grab and who would want to do this to our
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:23.180]  country who would want to do this to our children who really wants to do this
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:29.940]  they are using the NSA and other agencies to target the general public it's a
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:33.260]  weird feeling when I went to cover Bilderberg and they had plain clothes
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:40.220]  Marines threatening us flipping us off pulling dirty tricks on us and it later
[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:43.140]  came out was confirmed that their diplomatic security corps was there
[02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:52.100]  they saw us as the enemy they had been trained the Marines officers officers
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:57.220]  all some of them like 45 years old to harass peaceful journalists that they
[02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:02.620]  knew were peaceful this is the government we built and paid for being
[02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:07.300]  turned against us and the press is being persecuted it's just it's clear
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:11.260]  where this is going we're not troublemakers up here just just just
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:16.140]  saying oh come on it's all been proven William Benny before we take some final
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:21.420]  calls what do you think hurts the NSA most because the fact that they lied and
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:25.460]  denied they were spying on citizens and non-terror related cases and the fact
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:30.700]  that it's now come out I mean is that the biggest blow to the NSA and where do
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:35.580]  you think this fight's going actually I don't think it's in the long run I don't
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:38.220]  think it's been a blow to them I think they got it to the point where they
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:43.420]  simply don't care what the public thinks it's the arrogance of power hubris yeah
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:46.540]  and so I don't I don't think they really care I mean the one thing that could
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:50.460]  really hurt them is cutting their financial in the money cutting cutting the
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:54.180]  budget that they have that that is the thing that would hurt them that's why
[02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:58.260]  they got so nervous about representatives the Amosion Connors and
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:03.940]  their coalition group to unfund and as they flashed July I mean I don't think I
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:09.660]  told you this on the on the programs before but I was scheduled to brief that
[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:17.900]  coalition prior to prior to them voting on unfunding NSA and when when they
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:21.140]  posted that on the congressional record that I was coming down there to testify
[02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:26.300]  to them what happened was the president Obama called a meeting of all the
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:31.500]  members of the house all all the house Democratic members at the same time so
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:37.340]  that basically killed that meeting and so that was delayed but we never
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:41.220]  rescheduled so they never got and then they had to vote on it and they lost
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:44.980]  the vote because of lobbying by the president and also general Alexander
[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:50.220]  heavy lobbying to try to stop it they lost by 12 votes but that was pretty
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:55.820]  good from a first from a first cut I mean the basic motivation that started
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:58.580]  all this was the fact that they began to realize that they weren't being told
[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:02.300]  the truth by the intelligence committees or by the agencies or by the White
[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:08.700]  House so that they were being lied to all along because it's illegal yes so
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:16.980]  simple let's talk to Michael you know hi oh you're on the air hi I think there
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:19.420]  might have been a mistake there I'm actually calling from FEMA region five
[02:12:19.420 --> 02:12:23.780]  but I just kind of wanted to talk to Mr. Benny about what he thought about the
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:28.220]  racial divide that they're bringing up to kind of distract us from what's going
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:31.820]  on with the NSA that's a great point we're all having our rights to privacy
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:36.460]  taken and meanwhile you think the only issue in the world is race William
[02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:41.940]  Benny it's a standard thing that the dictator does when you when you are
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:46.300]  having internal problems in your country you create an external threat so in this
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:49.940]  case what they're doing is creating other threats or other other conflicts to
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:54.940]  deflect the interest and focus away from core issues that are fundamental to
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:13:02.540]  everything we do absolutely right about that anything else Michael yeah I think
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:06.260]  it's funny that the issues like Ebola and ISIS have also been kind of slept
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:09.780]  under the rug and no one wants to focus on that but they sure want to focus on
[02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:14.260]  the race issue of what exactly what they want us to focus on thank you Michael
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:21.540]  Peter in Washington you're on the air yes I have a question I know it's
[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:27.500]  about before your time but what do you think of Alan Dulles do you know
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:32.700]  anything about or heard anything about him with regard to how whether he was
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:40.340]  not so bad or really bad and so forth no I'm I didn't know anything about him
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:46.140]  or is it when he was in office I didn't I wasn't aware of what he was doing so
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:51.940]  appreciate your let's talk to Anthony in Florida you're on the air
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:14:00.300]  hello yes go ahead I got a question for mr. Benny is it is it been has it been
[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:07.660]  profitable like for a long time that the NSA has the capability and technology
[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:13.700]  to actually watch for example somebody walking down and on a street you know
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:20.340]  like we call it sir let me tell you since you're hesitating they have
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:23.860]  satellites with infrared other things can track people in real time they're tied
[02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:27.900]  into a lot of the cameras nationwide that have face scanning software on them
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:31.500]  that's all admitted they're getting ready to get attacks by the mile using
[02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:38.820]  these systems what is your specific question oh like the NSA for a long
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:45.220]  time has it had the capability to actually see see people even before the
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:53.660]  yes even for decades yeah wow that's amazing it certainly is elaborate on
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:58.780]  that to mr. Benny well I mean it's like it's like the it's like the overhead
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:02.140]  photography that kind of thing you've seen those pictures I mean you can see
[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:06.380]  they've had that capability for decades I mean that that's how you watch things
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:11.740]  on the earth that's how one of the that's how the the photo interpreters are
[02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:18.780]  and then at the national photographic centers national national center used to
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:22.660]  be called and pick I think it's I can't remember what it was called right now but
[02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:25.900]  it is another agency that handles photography and they've been doing that
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:30.340]  for decades space command and all of it but they couldn't see for two weeks al
[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:35.500]  qaeda renamed ISIS pouring in out of Syria in long convoys they couldn't
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:41.380]  stop that but they'll go arrest some teenager on Twitter that makes a threat
[02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:46.540]  don't worry don't worry did you see the case where supposedly the NSA called a
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:51.700]  high school to tell the school to start watching one of the kids no I didn't
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:57.900]  but you know see this this has been my major contention that the domestic
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:02.260]  spying the reason they're doing it is not because of terrorism it's because
[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:06.540]  it's for law enforcement and internal security domestic security that's what
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:10.060]  they're doing it for that's the main that gives them see when they they look
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:16.580]  around after 9-11 they had to look around for a customer set what would
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:20.060]  be the biggest customer set they could go in for that would be law enforcement
[02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:23.980]  because it involves local law enforcement state and federal law enforcement
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:27.140]  everywhere as well as all around the world with other law enforcement you set
[02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:31.300]  up threat fusion centers where you slowly see which cops will go along with
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:34.620]  illegal spying and then you recruit them in last year I was at Barton Springs a
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:39.420]  big public natural spring there were three cops well three male cops and three
[02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:45.980]  female cops I think they were all police or in the end criminal justice they were
[02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:48.900]  all laying out talking about how they were going back to get more courses
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:52.860]  because two of them already worked at the NSA center in San Antonio and all the
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:56.620]  rest of them wanted jobs there and how great it was and how powerful they were
[02:16:56.620 --> 02:17:01.300]  and that's what's crazy it's how these people just brag about what they're
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:05.140]  involved in and it's just so undisciplined on top of it it's just
[02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:09.420]  really pathetic and and then back last year in August think it was the
[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:13.020]  writers published that article about the parallel construction and they're
[02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:16.940]  in a dead in interview with one of the federal agents involved in the in
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:21.420]  looking at the NSA data and fault and doing parallel constructions and he
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:27.220]  said this is such a great program I just hope we can keep it secret in that
[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:31.540]  cute yeah that's our secret government and operation how about I come to their
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:34.340]  house and watch them in bed and read their email no they don't freak out
[02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:39.700]  these people are sick miss something wrong with them unbelievable let's talk
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:45.460]  to Shane in Michigan you're on the air go ahead mr. Benny you mentioned that the
[02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:51.260]  NSA might come in with the National Guard to nationalize resources in Utah if
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:56.500]  that state turns off the water and my question is does this mean that the NSA
[02:17:56.500 --> 02:18:00.780]  is in fact reliant on resources that are provided at the state and local levels
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:05.580]  and that if we can't get the Congress to do anything this might be a last last
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:10.620]  ditch effort to put a chokehold on them and stop what they're doing yeah but I
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:15.500]  would not I would not advocate that I mean I would advocate hitting your
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:20.260]  state and local government employees and making sure that they stand up and
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:24.780]  resist this and also hit all your people representatives in Congress and then if
[02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:27.860]  they don't get they don't start going along we need to have a unified effort
[02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:32.220]  to fire them get rid of them that's right I mean I'm not normally for just
[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:35.220]  standard civil disobedience but then I agree with what mr. Benny saying in
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:41.220]  general but the state triggering a constitutional crisis blocking water
[02:18:41.220 --> 02:18:46.260]  cutting off electricity forced the National Guard in to restore the water
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:51.340]  and the power to draw attention to it I think these are the type of stunts we
[02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:55.140]  need to start seeing me pulled I think the state government could do that but I
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:59.220]  wouldn't advocate individuals absolutely not no no no we don't want to be put on
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:04.100]  a terrorist list and they'll call it terrorism in fact they might even bomb
[02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:08.660]  themselves to look like victims false flags the sky's the limit but this has
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:12.980]  gone too far it is time to have state governments peacefully start moving
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:17.100]  with injunctions and kind of like Texas is suing over Obamacare with 17 other
[02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:21.820]  states yeah right it's time to say no or like I like I think we talked about an
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:25.340]  earlier program that they could have a constitutional convention where the
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:29.580]  states would hold it and keep everybody in DC out of it and then modify the
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:34.380]  Constitution and operate from that sure is it fair to say we now have a rogue
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:41.140]  federal government yes in my view that's exactly what we have yeah it's like
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:44.300]  you come back from being on vacation your employees have changed the locks
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:47.540]  they're telling you that it's their business their house and they have no
[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:51.860]  legal standing but they got a bunch of guns yep and they're just staring at us
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:56.220]  telling us we're terrorists and then we we don't confront them we go home and
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:19:59.460]  try to figure out how to be peaceful and then they send a SWAT team to our
[02:19:59.460 --> 02:20:04.740]  home and get us out of the shower yeah that's right that's what happened to you
[02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:10.340]  I mean it's just it's craziness now John Corzine and Goldman Sachs can take
[02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:13.700]  billions out of bank accounts and not give it back and MF global and nobody
[02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:18.340]  gets in trouble I mean it's just it's just we're in trouble people they are out
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:23.260]  of control and historically that means they'll just power grab and power grab
[02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:28.820]  until everything starts collapsing Jay in California only got a few minutes left
[02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:33.060]  with our guests Jay thanks for calling you're on there with William Benning yeah
[02:20:33.060 --> 02:20:37.220]  I'll be real brief mr. Benny I just had to dish out a little bit of gratitude
[02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:42.540]  to yourself and obviously Alex Jones for bringing up this kind of stuff and this
[02:20:42.540 --> 02:20:47.020]  media operation for years and exposing kind of what's going on and now it seems
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:51.860]  that that's an agreement it's the consensus among the republic among the
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:56.660]  public in this republic that we're being spied on illegally that these judges
[02:20:56.660 --> 02:21:01.580]  are being you know basically with inside baseball blackmailed into changing
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:09.260]  laws and and the rest of it and I was just curious what you would advise
[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:15.620]  people and I know I'm not asking just for myself I'm asking on behalf of others
[02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:21.300]  that I talked to that don't feel that there's real government as you we can
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:24.620]  all agree it's a real government we don't believe it can be put back together
[02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:28.300]  that empty dumps is broken and can't be put back together again what would you
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:34.260]  say about that well I would say that there are ways we have some ways to try
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:39.460]  to help save and salvage our country and one of the primary ways is to get
[02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:43.380]  active in politics and stand up and make sure you're you're if you're going to
[02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:46.620]  elect somebody as a representative that they stand up and defend the
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:50.860]  Constitution and the foundation founding principles of this country that's
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:54.100]  something that they're the current crop of people we have down there in
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:57.220]  Washington aren't doing right now they're violating every way they possibly
[02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:01.060]  can and they're and they're getting everybody they possibly can to support
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:04.020]  what they're doing and cover up for them that's right they're circling the
[02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:08.940]  wagons to use the whistleblowers and the political awakening as a way to
[02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:13.900]  actually legitimize this giant usurpation of our basic freedoms and if we
[02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:17.220]  don't start backing them off at this point the sky is the limit we've
[02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:21.300]  already basically reached the sky we're now going out into outer space few
[02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:25.180]  final calls we're going to let our gracious guest go Mike in Wyoming you're
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:31.180]  on the year worldwide hi mr. Benny my recollection is that Perry Truman
[02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:36.900]  created NSA just just with the stroke of his pen that Congress never actually
[02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:42.060]  created that the agency by statute that's entitled to funding in the first
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:46.980]  place that's that's correct but as the funding comes out of the Department of
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:52.420]  Defense so the Department of Defense slices out a set of funding for them
[02:22:52.420 --> 02:22:56.620]  but it's under as since the FISA laws they they've now have to committees
[02:22:56.620 --> 02:23:00.780]  overseeing them and overseeing their budgets but those committees have been
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:05.620]  basically usurped and are basically advocates for these agencies and they
[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:09.660]  they tend to support them no matter what which means that their their
[02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:14.580]  committees get to manage larger budgets as the agencies themselves grow so from
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:18.580]  their perspective they look at that as a positive contribution when in fact they
[02:23:18.580 --> 02:23:22.420]  should be standing up for our rights and stopping these people under the FISA
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:26.220]  law alone that that was the reason the church committee said that's what the
[02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:28.980]  church committee came up with that's what they said and this is how we're
[02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:32.180]  going to try to set up checks and balances well those checks and balances
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:36.660]  over time have proven to just outright fail they I mean they're nonexistent now
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:40.580]  I mean the FISA courts of rubber stamp the intelligence committees are
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:44.940]  advocates for the agency to do domestic spying when in fact they they were
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:48.580]  created their found their founding principles for for the creation of
[02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:53.420]  those were to prevent spies spying agencies in the United States from
[02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:57.980]  spying on the United States citizens domestically and that they totally failed
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:03.580]  at it is a criminal big brother revolution by bureaucrats and corporate
[02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:10.660]  and government interest to openly execute fraud upon us until it becomes
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:15.300]  common law precedent and it is just over the top they're getting away with it
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:21.340]  Mike anything else no that's all thank you thank you very much well folks we
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:27.820]  are basically out of time with our guest William Benny we've got Chris John
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:31.660]  Truth Raider Frank and many others holding all trying to answer answer
[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:36.700]  your questions as best I can mr. Benny people constantly say where are the
[02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:39.380]  whistleblowers where are good people in government good people in
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:43.180]  corporations well whether it's John Perkins who was an economic hitman for
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:47.260]  big banks or whether it's Colonel Schaeffer or General Benton K. Parton
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:53.660]  or countless other people we have had on this broadcast Tosh Plumlee Celica
[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:59.020]  Steel hundreds and hundreds and hundreds Terry Reed it's got to be over a
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:04.460]  thousand now whistleblowers from state federal international level Wolfgang
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:08.140]  Wurdar the head of the EU vaccine program admitting the vaccines are
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:12.980]  tainted I mean the truth is we actually have more people in major
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:17.300]  corporations and governments that do go public and in the public doesn't get
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:21.740]  behind them or listens to mainstream media demonizing them to the point of
[02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:26.700]  now where they're arresting and persecuting the press not just people
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:30.660]  that internally blew the whistle and gave up your your career heading up a
[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:35.900]  major agency I mean it's just I think it's the immorality and the laziness of
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:40.980]  the American people that at the end of the day is allowing this I don't think
[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:45.380]  we are the progenitors of it but we're the people that allow it and as Eric
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:49.980]  Hoffer said propaganda does not deceive people it merely helps them deceive
[02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:54.660]  themselves and men have to ask do they really only want sports center and
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:26:00.140]  fantasy football over a free country and a future do women only want to go out
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:03.140]  and party and act like tarts or do they want to have a future for their
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:07.660]  children because we're going into bondage this is only the beginning we
[02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:11.380]  can see the fruits of this tyranny as our country and the world goes down the
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:15.740]  drain they've started a global spy race now so who knows what's going to come
[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:20.220]  out of this it's destabilizing our world it's discrediting our country it's
[02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:23.300]  discrediting our tech companies because people don't want to do business with us
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:28.380]  I'm kind of ranting here at the end it's just why are we allowing this to
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:34.900]  happen it is so insane final comment well yeah you're pointing out the some
[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:39.460]  of the some of the some of the very short-sighted finite thinking that people
[02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:43.060]  went through when they first decided to do these kinds of things I start with
[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:48.820]  Cheney and his dark side business instead of focusing on and on doing the
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:54.620]  intelligence business and the military business in a focused disciplined way he
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:58.300]  went on a scatter approach let's go after everything and do everything we
[02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:02.660]  possibly can to ensure we get information well I mean it's been shown for a
[02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:07.900]  long time by any numbers of studies and examples testimony from various people
[02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:11.300]  that that torture doesn't work and if you torture people they'll tell you
[02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:16.380]  anything you want them to tell you and so what that means is you you need to do
[02:27:16.380 --> 02:27:21.260]  a disciplined approach and I think the FBI had it at at one point anyway they
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:25.100]  they they were thinking that the torture was not the way to go either and that
[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:27.660]  there were other ways to get the information and get it reliably and
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:32.100]  certainly we knew from the second business that was true and they they they
[02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:35.740]  went down a very bad path there they went down a very bad path everywhere I
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:42.340]  think the dark side is just the bad past that's all well sir you are a modern
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:48.500]  hero you have gone through hell lost your lucrative job done so many other
[02:27:48.500 --> 02:27:53.380]  things to warn us you raised the alarm as a modern Paul Revere and now it's up
[02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:58.020]  to us to try to carry the ball but I appreciate you working so hard and
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:02.460]  still going through the persecution I hope you write a book and now we know
[02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:05.060]  about all the illegal spying which is you know write a book about your
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:08.900]  experiences they can't stop you from writing about the persecution you've
[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:16.580]  gone through really you know I see it as a modern jungle you're just like the
[02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:21.180]  jungle exposed child labor and the Rockefeller factories I think your book
[02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:25.340]  or another big whistleblower book not so much getting into the spying even but
[02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:31.620]  just the response to it could be made into a film you name it and things like
[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:35.780]  that will turn around our society William Benny thank you so much thank
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:40.220]  you for having me alright folks there he goes an amazing individual and there's

[02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:02.500]  connections in my mind to other data it gives me a headache to look at one
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:07.420]  article gives me a headache like this article UNICEF calls 2014 one of the
[02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:12.580]  worst years on record for the world New York Times why does that give me a headache

[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:13.900]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:18.500]  most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within

[02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:36.020]  In the heat of the night,
[02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:47.580]  UNICEF calls 2014 one of the worst years on record for world's children and they
[02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:53.260]  go through all over the world 15 million children starve to death a year
[02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:58.540]  other 20 million adults they go through war 230 million children live in
[02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:07.540]  countries and areas ribbon by armed conflicts and this is the UN that goes
[02:34:07.540 --> 02:34:12.380]  around sterilizing people goes around engaging in massacres goes around
[02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:17.420]  destabilizing but every time you're at the shopping mall or something if a
[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:21.540]  woman looks like she's a model she's wearing a UNICEF shirt because that's
[02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:25.940]  how that's what models do Miss America what do you want to do I want to help
[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:32.060]  UNICEF help the children like give your money to the Red Cross and half of it
[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:35.260]  goes to gun control basically I'm not against you have you ever helped the
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:40.660]  Red Cross what you did was good but the organization itself is a globalist crime
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:46.860]  syndicate in my opinion same thing with United Way but the UN makes them all
[02:34:46.860 --> 02:34:52.740]  look like angels and it says they've been orphan kidnapped tortured recruited
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:58.740]  raped and even sold as slaves the same New York Times two years ago admitted
[02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:03.820]  that the UN in the Congo was going in and killing whole villages of people that
[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:08.020]  wouldn't leave their own ancestral land because they had promised it as a carbon
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:12.580]  sink under the UN oh you can have mines over here for big corporations but
[02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:17.420]  there has to be an offset now this land can have people on it so we're going to
[02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:22.940]  force you off I mean I remember had to be like 1998 if somebody's got national
[02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:27.420]  geographics you say find it for me I was like 98 because I covered it on air a
[02:35:27.420 --> 02:35:31.900]  bunch maybe 99 it was articles about Burma and a couple of the places about
[02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:39.460]  UN buffer zones in those countries and it showed UN troops and it said they
[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:44.980]  shoot anyone trying to come in period and how they'd run people off their
[02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:48.620]  ancestral lands there but I mean I know that's on record they did that the UN
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:52.980]  reportedly killed tens of thousands in Burma alone but there it was in an
[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:59.620]  article about how good it was with liberals reading it so see I see an
[02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:06.380]  article or the UN's trying to shave the kids again remember Prince Bernhard
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:12.140]  founded the World Wildlife Fund the other cause celeb thing of every young
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:20.860]  college girl he used it on record as a front look it up for running giant
[02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:24.660]  poaching operations in Africa you know how much you can get for all that ivory
[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:28.020]  and stuff especially in China where they grind it up and eat it as a medicinal
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:34.700]  for tiger claws and all the rest of it last time I heard I think a tiger claw
[02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:42.460]  is something like $5,000 a gram or something ridiculous the point is is
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:53.740]  that it'd be like Count Dracula running a blood bank it's just the the USO let's
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:57.420]  say you pronounce it right the what's the group they set up during World War
[02:36:57.420 --> 02:37:02.620]  2 where the celebrities go play for the troops yeah great organization does a
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:07.660]  lot of great stuff Bob Hope whole nine yards nothing against you entertainment
[02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:11.020]  for the troops or whatever but it was founded by George Herbert Walker Bush
[02:37:11.020 --> 02:37:16.660]  his dad Prescott Bush when he was about to be indicted by the McCormick-Dickstein
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:20.940]  Committee basically for being the main Nazi collaborator so he comes out with
[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:26.100]  a thing for the troops you know that's the thing about knowing history is that
[02:37:26.100 --> 02:37:30.220]  it's so frustrating you see one article like this and then it makes you think of
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:33.580]  all the stuff they're doing and it's always irritating to see the very
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:43.740]  people involved in all this evil posing as the good guys here's another
[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:50.260]  another New York Times Bush and CIA ex-officials rebut torture report the
[02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:55.300]  new Senate report that's a whitewash admits the torture the Democrats is
[02:37:55.300 --> 02:37:59.300]  trying to score some political points that's what the CIA was spying on them
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:03.420]  illegally but it doesn't make Diane Feinstein good that she's being spied
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:08.300]  on see it's just a ship of rats fighting with each other but the issue here is
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:10.820]  back when they thought they had a miracle eating out of their hand they
[02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:15.260]  admitted tortured on television why Jack Bauer tortured every night on 24 he was
[02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:24.260]  always right he was a good guy but they didn't torture somebody like give us you
[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:29.140]  know you capture a code expert who knows how the German code works show us how
[02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:35.380]  this machine works when I start chopping your fingers off what really works is
[02:38:35.380 --> 02:38:39.380]  we're gonna hunt your kids down in Germany and kill them we've got hit teams
[02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:42.900]  inside your country right now if you don't tell us that's bad enough but
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:48.260]  that would work sometimes in an absolute emergency situation where you know what
[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:51.620]  you're going after and I'm against torture but the claims that torture
[02:38:51.620 --> 02:38:57.100]  doesn't work it's not really completely true what it really works for though is
[02:38:57.100 --> 02:39:01.380]  false confessions and to flip people over to be double agents to do whatever
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:08.900]  you want that's what tortures really all about and it's what tyrants do and
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:12.380]  upright countries don't do it George Washington if he caught his troops
[02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:16.820]  torturing because the British troops would torture to get intel he would hang
[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:21.980]  you look it up and you know why he hang you because he wanted the moral high
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:27.300]  ground if you got caught raping a woman George Washington would hang you and
[02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:31.660]  foreign generals from Germany and others came over here and and and really
[02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:38.540]  admired the colonial army because it didn't engage in war crimes and
[02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:44.220]  everybody else did and that's one reason they ended up winning the public
[02:39:44.220 --> 02:39:49.220]  support and winning the war because there was a moral high ground that had to
[02:39:49.220 --> 02:39:54.460]  be attained George Washington wasn't a wimp because he didn't torture and he
[02:39:54.460 --> 02:40:00.300]  didn't rape and didn't elude he knew he had to have the moral high ground now he
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:04.860]  did sit down every morning and sign death warrants on traitors that were
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:15.220]  working with the British who would be assassinated that's not torture so
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:20.940]  that's the difference ladies and gentlemen and it's a guarantee that we're
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:28.900]  going to Hades in a handbasket with all the garbage that's going on and I've
[02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:32.580]  got three children and I love them and I want them to have a future with your
[02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:40.580]  children and that's why we got to turn this around now there's a story up on
[02:40:40.580 --> 02:40:44.380]  drugsreport.com we also have it up on info wars.com I'm going to tweet it out at
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:50.060]  Bill Alex Jones and Compton on Obama he launched profanity lace tirades against
[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:53.860]  the press according to ABC news journalists and Compton rock Obama
[02:40:53.860 --> 02:40:57.820]  launching a profanity lace tirades against the press and off the record
[02:40:57.820 --> 02:41:01.740]  meeting with reporters I've been watching Obama used to seem real slick and
[02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:06.100]  happy and kind of bebopping as a narcissist he looks really upset now
[02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:12.340]  now he has acid reflux on the stuff in a C-span interview Compton also derided
[02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:15.900]  the president for leading the most opaque that means hard to see through
[02:41:15.900 --> 02:41:20.940]  administration of any I have covered and this is just the degeneration of
[02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:24.380]  government it's going to get worse and worse the journalist who retired in
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:28.060]  August of her 40-year career revealed the C-spans Ryan Lam I have seen in the
[02:41:28.060 --> 02:41:32.780]  last year Obama really angry twice both were off the record times I got a
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:37.060]  question what is she doing bringing up an off the record discussion I don't like
[02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:41.100]  Obama but if it's not a crime he's committing you don't bring up an off the
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:46.340]  record discussion see these journalists are a pack of rats they're just as bad
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:50.220]  or worse as Obama they go along with the sellout of the country and then when
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:54.860]  they retire they dish dirt on people that gave him confidence let's go ahead
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:42:00.780]  and play the clip here it is I have seen in the last year Barack Obama really
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:07.380]  angry twice both were off the record times one profanity laced where he
[02:42:07.380 --> 02:42:12.060]  thought the press was making too much of scandals that he didn't think were
[02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:19.220]  scandals another where he took us to task for not understanding the limits he
[02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:23.220]  has with foreign policy in the way he's dealing with the Middle East and Iraq
[02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:29.820]  and Afghanistan and I don't find him apologetic but I find him willing to
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:32.660]  stand up to the press and look him in the eye even though it was off the record
[02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:42.020]  and just give us hell from his point of view he may but we cover what we are
[02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:46.660]  allowed to cover and when the decision and this is all about how the press is
[02:42:46.660 --> 02:42:51.780]  in a fight with him and how how she was there and she's not gonna let him boss
[02:42:51.780 --> 02:43:01.100]  around all about her her her do you understand folks she was in an off the
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:06.500]  record meeting she's not a journalist see I don't claim to be a journalist first
[02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:11.660]  and foremost but if you're an off the record discussion with me it's that I
[02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:16.980]  don't even tell crew about it sometimes I'll have guests during the break start
[02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:21.380]  telling me stuff off the record I go I trust my crew but this isn't really off
[02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:26.420]  the record you got a bunch of people listening to this and to watch them all
[02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:30.180]  these swollen people they work for mainstream media acting like you know
[02:43:30.180 --> 02:43:38.860]  they're sycophantic journalists and I'm not I'm a conspiracy theorist people
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:43.060]  like this woman couldn't get a William Benion and have him say exactly right
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:46.420]  precisely right you know why I'm precisely right about the NSA I've
[02:43:46.420 --> 02:43:51.740]  studied it for 20 years I've interviewed scores of whistleblowers and I'm just so
[02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:58.620]  sick of these sophistic swollen dishonorable pieces of trash up there
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:04.740]  about how their big journalist is there on ABC news you're a joke
[02:44:05.940 --> 02:44:10.100]  does she ever say in here why she's opening up about something that's off
[02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:17.900]  record man you know I get mad by her I'm so sick of telling people something's
[02:44:17.900 --> 02:44:22.100]  off the record and then they go and blabber that everywhere because a lot of
[02:44:22.100 --> 02:44:25.900]  times you'll toss money something off the record to help them or to give them a
[02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:30.300]  little tidbit and in this dishonorable unshivaled with society people then take
[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:35.340]  that as ooh I better spread this because it's really off the record

[02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:46.900]  you will appreciate also is the attorney's skill of the black arts
[02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:55.140]  word crafting they seem to want to deem to term this warrantless data that they
[02:48:55.140 --> 02:49:00.740]  came without any probable cause for future pros a s contusions is data
[02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:05.980]  instead of warrantless evidence that's being gleaned for future pros a
[02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:10.180]  execution that's right they call it metadata when it's everything including
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:16.740]  full recordings of everything patently felonies every one of them well and the
[02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:20.780]  prostitutes of course they like to tell these different things they've gotten
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:25.740]  from the torture projects but if the truth is they provided no actionable
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:31.860]  intel well it's designed to actually make us blind from real threats because
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:36.180]  the globalists run those while spying on good people in government you heard him
[02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:41.460]  the main focus now is spying on good people imagine William Benny is
[02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:45.540]  secretly testifying to Congress trying to fix things internally the former head
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:52.420]  of the NSA and they swat team him at his house when he's in the shower in the

[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:12.740]  come in and get the computers even that is an abuse I mean it's purely how out
[02:50:12.740 --> 02:50:16.660]  of control is the Justice Department and the Obama administration and all these
[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:23.180]  agencies if they're arresting people like Drake and others I mean it's not like
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:26.460]  there's Snowden who ran to Russia to release the info but see what was
[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:31.380]  Snowden supposed to do then if they're arresting people for nothing then he did

[02:55:55.260 --> 02:56:00.340]  not rogue it is totally criminal and the only way to deal with criminals is by
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:06.900]  force now who is going to force them out Alex not us the US military must get
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:10.780]  involved and implement operation balkyrie because we're running out of
[02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:17.180]  time the ballot box doesn't work anymore it's broken okay and if you are
[02:56:17.180 --> 02:56:21.020]  familiar with your history of Staufenberg and the co-plotters they
[02:56:21.020 --> 02:56:26.180]  had assembled a committee of German civilians to take over as soon as they
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:30.620]  got rid of Hitler and his henchmen this is what the US military can do we're
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:34.180]  running out of time they're going to start a war with Russia they're itching
[02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:38.940]  to do it we must reach out to the military in the Pentagon and have them
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:43.700]  remove the criminals well there'd have to be a larger discussion about
[02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:48.340]  constitutional convention the state's coming together the bankers the globalist
[02:56:48.340 --> 02:56:51.180]  the Federal Reserve been so smart they've got all the pension funds invested
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:55.900]  derivatives they've got a so dependent it's like half our heart is cancer
[02:56:55.900 --> 02:57:02.100]  so if we cut the cancer out it cuts half our ventricles out and we die so we've
[02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:07.700]  got to like find some way to reduce the tumor and then remove it in pieces or
[02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:11.620]  something because I agree it's going to go towards heart attack and death
[02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:16.660]  anyways the tumor keeps growing but if we chop it out at one time it'll kill us
[02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:22.660]  as well you've got to first educate the public and you got to support whistle
[02:57:22.660 --> 02:57:28.180]  blowers but I hear you man I hear you it's it's serious but it's not just the
[02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:33.740]  US it's a global group of criminals that one major tentacle has grabbed us so
[02:57:33.740 --> 02:57:37.940]  see that's the thing even if the military took over and they convene the
[02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:41.140]  governors and the states decide to what to do and what would you do with
[02:57:41.140 --> 02:57:44.740]  Congress Congress won't even do its job they're all bought and paid for by the
[02:57:44.740 --> 02:57:49.140]  same people well then who decides who to remove and who to keep usually those
[02:57:49.140 --> 02:57:54.460]  type of things get worse not better so it's a very sophisticated problem I
[02:57:54.460 --> 02:58:00.540]  appreciate your call you know what I've got it ended here I'm Frank and Chris
[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:06.260]  Chris to Kentucky real fast go ahead final caller yeah Alex we just had an
[02:58:06.260 --> 02:58:09.220]  article in the courier journal about these after all this Ferguson New York
[02:58:09.220 --> 02:58:12.940]  City problems that we've been having now that the local police department here is
[02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:16.460]  all of a sudden we're gonna get cameras on their chest my question about these
[02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:20.220]  things I'm concerned about this is all digital database is that where does that
[02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:26.460]  information go into those cameras yes they are going to basically keep all of
[02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:29.900]  it and I'm not against it overall problem is cops just turn them off and say
[02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:34.300]  they malfunction when they feel like it so you know that's the problem and then
[02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:37.620]  pretty soon do we have to have cameras on us to prove we're not bad it's kind of
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:41.460]  like satellite tracker boxes the police cars I mean it's just like they get the
[02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:49.300]  police state first I don't know it's kind of double-edged great job crew the
