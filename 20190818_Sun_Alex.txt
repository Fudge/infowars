[00:40.520 --> 00:47.080]  really trying to zen out right now and be as calm as I can it's quite frankly I
[00:47.080 --> 00:50.640]  know that I'm more effective at getting the truth out when I am calm and I'm
[00:50.640 --> 00:54.800]  actually pretty calm in my daily life but when I read all this news information
[00:54.800 --> 01:03.000]  and I get up on air there's a real sense of urgency and a real sense to hit it
[01:03.000 --> 01:12.520]  all there's a report up on info wars.com and news wars.com that really
[01:12.520 --> 01:19.160]  deserves to go viral if you care about children a lot of people ask me how
[01:19.160 --> 01:23.280]  did I know about Jeffrey Epstein 10 years ago or longer and how did I know
[01:23.280 --> 01:27.560]  the specifics of how he was into eugenics and transhumanism well they all
[01:27.560 --> 01:37.400]  are it's a cult and people thought I must have some secret sources Greg Reese
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.240]  one of our great researchers one of our reporters investigative journalists came
[01:42.240 --> 01:46.560]  to me last week he said did you know about congressional testimonies with
[01:46.560 --> 01:54.080]  video admitting MKUltra and programs of programming sex slaves and assassins and
[01:54.080 --> 01:59.040]  I said yeah I knew Dr. Ewing Cameron and jolly and west ran those programs there's
[01:59.040 --> 02:01.920]  even been history channel shows I knew there was congressional reports and
[02:01.920 --> 02:08.360]  even a report put out in 95 by the inspector general admitting that the
[02:08.360 --> 02:14.200]  government ran these programs but I'd know there was video well you know
[02:14.200 --> 02:19.840]  C-SPAN has archived everything going back 30 years now and folks went in and
[02:19.840 --> 02:25.640]  dug it out this is Congress interviewing children that are we're now
[02:25.640 --> 02:37.880]  young adults who confirm that they were government sex slaves and being trained
[02:37.880 --> 02:42.480]  to be assassins and the government knows it it's declassified and they're in
[02:42.480 --> 02:48.640]  the committee rooms there's hours of this the reports only eight and a half
[02:48.640 --> 02:55.320]  minutes long but later this week we've got to do a special broadcast or
[02:55.320 --> 03:03.600]  something in error I mean there's like six hours of this and these are
[03:03.600 --> 03:09.120]  confirmed foster children and people that were grabbed out of government homes
[03:09.120 --> 03:15.720]  and shipped to Canada and the US to government facilities it's one thing to
[03:15.720 --> 03:23.640]  read it declassified in 77 these these videos these films from 77 in the Frank
[03:23.640 --> 03:33.080]  Church committee hearings it's another thing to see these people so I've got a
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.440]  lot of incredible news here I've got them growing human organs inside cows and

[03:56.400 --> 04:01.480]  see uh-oh Jeffrey Epstein all these forensic pathologists and experts say
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.440]  no you can only do this by somebody breaking your neck or if he was
[04:05.440 --> 04:09.160]  professionally hung which didn't happen he was killed only 20% of Americans
[04:09.160 --> 04:13.120]  believe Epstein committed suicide but don't worry CNN says that's because
[04:13.120 --> 04:16.960]  they're racist seriously that's the new thing they say that Trump needs to shut
[04:16.960 --> 04:23.880]  up meanwhile you don't really hear about the news because nobody cares when

[06:42.160 --> 06:46.600]  have done it in defiance of hollywood and the chai comms and the globalist the
[06:46.600 --> 06:50.960]  deep state they tell you you're not supposed to listen to this show they
[06:50.960 --> 06:53.480]  can't wait to their ai's wired into everything they think they're gonna be
[06:53.480 --> 06:57.280]  able to stop you from able to find us in the near future the congressional
[06:57.280 --> 07:02.480]  hearings a month ago or google and others promise senator blumenthal that they'd
[07:02.480 --> 07:06.240]  have me completely off the internet soon they were working on it and now
[07:06.240 --> 07:10.120]  facebook's announcing with its whatsapp they're gonna go in and read what
[07:10.120 --> 07:15.080]  you're doing and well ban you off that if they say you're using the wrong gender
[07:15.080 --> 07:22.640]  pronouns to quote Tucker Carlson these people aren't frightening or anything at
[07:22.640 --> 07:28.040]  the bottom of the hour I'm gonna air a report that is eight and a half minutes
[07:28.040 --> 07:34.640]  long that is beyond critical to get out it's on info wars.com and news wars.com
[07:34.640 --> 07:38.160]  just one of an hour ago we're gonna air it here and they give you the rest of
[07:38.160 --> 07:45.560]  the story but it's congressional hearings in 1977 this is something I never
[07:45.560 --> 07:51.360]  seen I just read the transcripts of young people that were in admitted sex
[07:51.360 --> 07:59.920]  slave mind control programs to corrupt and blackmail high-powered men but also
[07:59.920 --> 08:05.240]  to be assigned to them as sex operatives if they need to be assassinated this
[08:05.240 --> 08:11.160]  isn't conjecture this isn't speculation this is admitted people keep asking how
[08:11.160 --> 08:15.720]  do you know about the blackmail rings how'd you know about the because this is
[08:15.720 --> 08:25.320]  how secret societies have operated for thousands of years they're just cults of
[08:25.320 --> 08:32.640]  power they're gangs the homeless people in California and all over are now
[08:32.640 --> 08:36.400]  forming themselves into gangs and getting more and more aggressive so from
[08:36.400 --> 08:42.840]  the lowest IQ to the highest IQ people form themselves into groups and we face
[08:42.840 --> 08:47.600]  predatory psychopathic groups you know you can go look at the studies that are
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.000]  legion but are very accurate because we've all seen it manifested with our own
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.080]  two eyes but statistically you might have a psychopath and it's generally
[08:57.080 --> 09:00.960]  genetic but some can be artificially created through trauma that's what this
[09:00.960 --> 09:08.200]  is all about and and maybe one psychopath out of five hundred a sociopath out
[09:08.200 --> 09:14.480]  of 20 and then this modern culture is producing more sociopaths those have
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.480]  genetic tendencies but it's nature and nurture but when you look in CEO positions
[09:19.480 --> 09:26.000]  or military commanding positions there are a lot of accurate estimates and
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  studies that have been done that at least a third of the people are high
[09:30.000 --> 09:37.880]  functioning high IQ psychopaths just type in psychopaths and leadership
[09:37.880 --> 09:42.840]  psychopaths the CEOs because they don't have the normal feelings we have and
[09:42.840 --> 09:50.040]  they're willing to do anything now a low-level psychopath wants to grab your
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.960]  daughter out of the backyard and torture him to death for fun a high-powered
[09:53.960 --> 09:58.200]  one would set up an intelligence agency and test people incrementally until
[09:58.200 --> 10:03.880]  compartmentalized groups had it with men in white lab coats were doing it and for
[10:03.880 --> 10:07.800]  their country they abused a five-year-old and three-year-old children to
[10:07.800 --> 10:15.480]  create multiple personalities they can program it's for the country no ladies
[10:15.480 --> 10:21.960]  and gentlemen it's not for the country it's for the globalist system so I know
[10:21.960 --> 10:26.840]  all this is horrifying and we don't want this to be the way it is but it is the
[10:26.840 --> 10:33.080]  way it is every culture from ancient Asia to Africa to Latin America to the
[10:33.080 --> 10:37.960]  druids of Europe would go through cycles where they would get a psychotic
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.400]  priest class in place some priest class created aquifers and buildings and
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.840]  medicine and science and said empower women empower everyone that's the
[10:46.840 --> 10:55.240]  Renaissance that's Christians real Christians Christ energy but in the
[10:55.240 --> 11:00.280]  other systems it's men that understand how humans work and they use the fact
[11:00.280 --> 11:05.760]  that they've got gathered ancestral knowledge that's been stored to then
[11:05.760 --> 11:11.240]  use it against everyone else and there's a predator class above us that sees us
[11:11.240 --> 11:15.080]  as animals that feed on us and this predator class develops in every
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.240]  culture and tells its inner workings that everyone else is an animal everyone
[11:19.240 --> 11:24.880]  else's trash reportedly Epstein's madam pimp that would round up young children
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.120]  for torture you name it it's all coming out people say well you're treating
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.600]  these little girls really bad you're hurting them she'd say they're trash
[11:31.600 --> 11:40.400]  they're not even human so at the bottom of the hour we're going to play that
[11:40.400 --> 11:46.560]  special report and you can deny to yourself this exists but it's already
[11:46.560 --> 11:53.000]  admitted and I can tell you incontrovertibly Trump is actively opposing
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.320]  this satanic network and is actively going after them and we've seen a more
[11:59.320 --> 12:04.640]  than tenfold increase in arrest of pedophiles in their cohorts and you've
[12:04.640 --> 12:10.080]  seen the top deputy pope number two to the pope you know indicted running
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.560]  hundreds of small boys some of them ended up dead the border patrols stopping
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.320]  the kids pouring across before Obama would say just let them into charities
[12:19.320 --> 12:23.380]  don't find out their names a bunch of them ended up dead thousands and sex
[12:23.380 --> 12:31.840]  abuse we know of this is a giant vampiric feeding frenzy that's going on and
[12:31.840 --> 12:39.360]  Trump is opposing it and that's why you see the incredible freakouts that's why
[12:39.360 --> 12:46.800]  you see all of the meltdowns taking place and the average leftist has now
[12:46.800 --> 12:54.240]  received the spirit they have now gotten the average leftist knows all of this
[12:54.240 --> 13:02.240]  and likes it because they're seeking after power and they have delusions of
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.280]  grandeur and they have been promised power over the earth and over others and
[13:08.280 --> 13:12.920]  they believe that when Hillary came in and others came into power globally that
[13:12.920 --> 13:19.440]  it would be their great time to rule but instead they're not being given all
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.360]  this power that they're seeking see they never had any innate power or
[13:23.360 --> 13:27.040]  connection to God or they had a connection they lost it and so they're
[13:27.040 --> 13:30.920]  seeing to overthrow creation itself because there's not a place for them in
[13:30.920 --> 13:37.200]  that order it's better to reign in hell than serve in heaven now we'll get to it
[13:37.200 --> 13:45.120]  next segment our top story I mentioned it earlier when I read the transcripts
[13:45.120 --> 13:50.920]  Friday when they broke it's what already knew and it's what was already in the
[13:50.920 --> 13:58.600]  WikiLeaks but it's the head of the New York Times in a 74 minute speech to
[13:58.600 --> 14:05.200]  hundreds of top New York Times operatives and he says we're gonna shift
[14:05.200 --> 14:11.520]  off Russia the public doesn't buy it and we're gonna go to race we've already
[14:11.520 --> 14:14.760]  been on that but they're going if you thought there was race spading and race
[14:14.760 --> 14:22.120]  war garbage before and they admit he says to remove Trump he says this will
[14:22.120 --> 14:30.360]  remove it so Trump lashes out at New York Times claims it's going on a racism
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.800]  witch hunt says the hill I know that there's no claiming it Netflix movies
[14:35.800 --> 14:40.600]  shows everywhere is white people are inherently bad apologize if you're white
[14:40.600 --> 14:45.720]  it is just incredible and the head of the New York Times tells his people he
[14:45.720 --> 14:49.400]  was listen just screaming racism at them does it do enough you've got to write
[14:49.400 --> 14:55.520]  elaborate stories about it and you've got to edit what Trump says he talks
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.000]  about this and he says and I apologize that we ran his quote saying we need to
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.880]  cry racism and unifies the country he goes we caught it we took it down we
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.000]  agree nothing positive can be said about Trump but he says we can't sucker the
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.160]  public and I've got the whole transcript right here

[19:06.920 --> 19:11.120]  close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.320]  nation and today the communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week
[19:15.320 --> 19:20.840]  ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what
[19:20.840 --> 19:25.280]  he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers that's
[19:25.280 --> 19:29.000]  beautiful Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.320]  so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want
[19:33.320 --> 19:37.520]  to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never gonna give up and all
[19:37.520 --> 19:41.680]  you've done is a wake of the human spirit the human spirit lives at info wars
[19:41.680 --> 19:46.560]  calm and news wars calm and I'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those
[19:46.560 --> 19:50.840]  links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance we
[19:50.840 --> 19:54.880]  are 1776 worldwide
[19:54.880 --> 20:06.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:06.040 --> 20:26.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[20:26.320 --> 20:34.040]  well so does he lie from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones show
[20:34.040 --> 20:38.000]  evil people have gotten together throughout history and organized
[20:38.000 --> 20:46.120]  criminal orders systems of predatory evil where they test their admittance
[20:46.120 --> 20:53.920]  their their minions their pawns in how ruthless and evil they can be the best
[20:53.920 --> 20:58.640]  way to test that out is getting them to abuse little innocent children you get
[20:58.640 --> 21:02.520]  somebody to do that you can get them to do anything override their humanity
[21:02.520 --> 21:08.760]  their soul their spirit and their journey to the dark side would be complete
[21:08.760 --> 21:14.600]  and we sit there and we look at the New York Times we look at all CNN MSNBC and
[21:14.600 --> 21:18.920]  they're just up there this is a white supremacist when he lowered flags
[21:18.920 --> 21:22.760]  because of the shooting in El Paso it was the Heil Hitler and you're just like
[21:22.760 --> 21:27.560]  this doesn't make sense it's targeting the dumbest people in the country and
[21:27.560 --> 21:33.320]  it's also creating hysteria where people think that if they don't jump on
[21:33.320 --> 21:38.000]  board with whatever the Democrats say they're gonna be called racist that's
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.680]  the new religion that's the system of bullying that these people are inducting
[21:44.680 --> 21:50.280]  everyone into now Trump came out and lashed out with the New York Times
[21:50.280 --> 21:58.560]  claiming it's going on a racism witch hunt now that the Russia gate has failed
[21:58.560 --> 22:10.360]  no ladies and gentlemen that's not what he claims that's what they say I came in
[22:10.360 --> 22:17.480]  her yesterday I did a special report this was such a big deal again anybody
[22:17.480 --> 22:22.520]  could pull up the transcript they haven't released the audio but slate
[22:22.520 --> 22:30.440]  magazine is who got it and you read the transcript it is unbelievable the head
[22:30.440 --> 22:36.720]  of the New York Times says to the employees look Russia didn't work he
[22:36.720 --> 22:42.720]  came up flat-footed these are quotes we're pivoting to race to remove him
[22:42.720 --> 22:47.840]  from office they're the ones bringing up race they're the ones lying they're
[22:47.840 --> 22:52.360]  the ones dividing they're the ones doing all of this and then they've got the
[22:52.360 --> 22:57.480]  nerve to act like it's Trump when he's done nothing but prison reform to get
[22:57.480 --> 23:03.320]  black people out of jail and tried to bring factories to the inner city it's
[23:03.320 --> 23:07.720]  amazing but it's beyond a racism witch hunt they're trying to invoke a civil
[23:07.720 --> 23:12.840]  war a month before the election Hillary was in trouble and it came out in
[23:12.840 --> 23:17.800]  WikiLeaks she was talking to top professors on her email saying we need
[23:17.800 --> 23:22.120]  to accelerate the culture war and the culture war is men against women women
[23:22.120 --> 23:26.200]  against men black against white old against young it just means divide and
[23:26.200 --> 23:31.000]  conquer it's how you control a population I know our audience gets this but the
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.280]  average leftist really believes they're storming the beaches of Normandy when
[23:35.280 --> 23:39.640]  they go out and hit somebody in the head that has an American flag or the
[23:39.640 --> 23:42.880]  incredible videos we're gonna play next hour when Joe Biggs who led the
[23:42.880 --> 23:48.680]  Patriot March successfully in Portland yesterday joins us and they're attacking
[23:48.680 --> 23:52.120]  little girls they're they're attacking old men they're pulling down American
[23:52.120 --> 23:58.920]  flags they're attacking people with hammers in their cars because they
[23:58.920 --> 24:05.760]  believe they're fighting Nazis but really the people fighting the Nazis are
[24:05.760 --> 24:13.240]  98% white they're very low IQ their drug addicts or their government or
[24:13.240 --> 24:19.600]  university employees out wearing mask the bad guys trying to destroy the First
[24:19.600 --> 24:22.800]  Amendment and say that conservatives and nationalist and pro-trump supporters
[24:22.800 --> 24:28.040]  you can't walk down American streets you're going to be attacked and so people
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.920]  that wear American flags and go into these cities like Portland or cities like
[24:33.920 --> 24:41.280]  San Francisco you get to experience what it's like to be Alex Jones you get to
[24:41.280 --> 24:49.120]  experience what it's like to be Donald Trump when they try to attack you when
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.400]  they try to kill you and you see how insane and vicious so now when I walk
[24:53.400 --> 24:58.160]  downtown in Austin Texas taken over by rejects from Californian they don't
[24:58.160 --> 25:01.360]  drive by and say F you you're going to prison Russian agent we've got that on
[25:01.360 --> 25:08.360]  tape many times or they walk right up and say it now they go F you Nazi die die
[25:08.360 --> 25:17.080]  I'm going to kill you we kill Nazis this is mind control when the so-called
[25:17.080 --> 25:21.040]  authorities the mainstream media sit up there in the New York Times and tells
[25:21.040 --> 25:28.640]  you Nazis are everywhere it's like WMD's in Iraq or the Salem witch trials it
[25:28.640 --> 25:34.760]  doesn't exist it's not real Tucker Carl's is absolutely right almost every
[25:34.760 --> 25:38.480]  ragtag white supremacist group it turns out is run by the Southern Poverty Law
[25:38.480 --> 25:44.600]  Center they have a new director at the ADL they got rid of Abe Foxman a few
[25:44.600 --> 25:48.920]  years ago who said everyone was a racist and they were losing lawsuits they were
[25:48.920 --> 25:52.360]  getting caught breaking into police departments they have a new director
[25:52.360 --> 25:55.000]  they've kind of backed off that I haven't seen the ADL doing that kind of
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.560]  stuff lately but the Southern Poverty Law Center is worse the ADL ever was and
[26:00.560 --> 26:04.360]  they just run around just making stuff up just like all the Democrats that have
[26:04.360 --> 26:10.400]  been caught staging racial attacks on themselves not just small it and now
[26:10.400 --> 26:16.680]  Tlaib has come out and it turns out was offered entry into Israel and but said
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.000]  I'm coming to protest and call for your destruction so they said we have a law
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.160]  against that if you're an outsider coming to say overthrow the country so
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.680]  no you can't come in she didn't want to see your grandmother it was all made up
[26:30.680 --> 26:38.120]  another stunt oh hey Tlaib they won't let one Palestinian into Saudi Arabia they
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.800]  won't let one Jew into Saudi Arabia oh but you don't care about that it's all
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.000]  about how Israel's bad and that's the litmus test and oh that's the little
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.200]  fetish if you oh attack Israel then you're on the inside crew and you're
[26:51.200 --> 26:56.120]  cool on the far right and the far left that really meet in fact I was never
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.320]  even pro-Israel I wasn't against Israel but all the bullying and all the lies
[27:00.320 --> 27:07.120]  that I worked for Israel well I am pro-Israel because the people that hate
[27:07.120 --> 27:10.920]  Israel act like it's one monolithic group and it's bad it doesn't have a right
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.640]  to exist just like we're told America doesn't have a right to exist and as a
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.560]  apartheid asked he's be overthrown yeah Israel's got problems it's got a bunch
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.440]  of different parties they kill each other just like we do but again this
[27:24.440 --> 27:31.440]  litmus test with a bunch of people who came to this country like Ilhan Omar
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.160]  when she can't even go back to her own country she'd be killed where they still
[27:35.160 --> 27:43.320]  have slavery and and and then she says Israel has a right to exist but then she
[27:43.320 --> 27:46.920]  never bitches about Saudi Arabia or all these other countries that are doing
[27:46.920 --> 27:53.760]  things a thousand times worse than what Israel's done I mean like oh Israel
[27:53.760 --> 27:57.240]  sometimes puts people in your pressure moves to make them talk okay that's
[27:57.240 --> 28:03.840]  wrong Saudi Arabia cuts your head off if you're gay oh but not a word out of her
[28:03.840 --> 28:08.000]  and all I'm saying is communist China's got a billion and a half people it's
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.120]  taking over our government it owns Hollywood it owns the debt you go all
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.560]  over the left to spam stuff it's Alex Jones is covering up for the Jews China's
[28:17.560 --> 28:23.680]  not a threat it's the Jews really isn't the Jews invading Hong Kong right now
[28:23.680 --> 28:30.520]  it's my issue is is that it's a cop out it's mental illness you have no
[28:30.520 --> 28:34.320]  political understanding they just go juice juice juice juice and meanwhile
[28:34.320 --> 28:41.400]  yeah it's leftist Jews calling for the overthrow of Israel and for my arrest so
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.480]  no no no and all these right wingers and left wingers played of the tune of
[28:45.480 --> 28:50.520]  self-hating leftist Jews it's sick it's just it's upside down world completely
[28:50.520 --> 28:54.640]  insane and I'm not gonna be part of the delusions but they're trying to cause a
[28:54.640 --> 29:00.480]  race war right now the globalist are ladies and gentlemen this isn't a
[29:00.480 --> 29:06.080]  Netflix drama show this isn't a law and order TV program this is reality I'll

[29:13.720 --> 29:17.600]  time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor power grab they
[29:17.600 --> 29:21.480]  didn't come like an enemy from over the horizon they came from inside and they

[31:14.680 --> 31:20.080]  farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for
[31:20.080 --> 31:24.640]  the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on
[31:24.640 --> 31:29.040]  our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't

[33:41.080 --> 33:46.240]  they're trying to trigger a civil war not just a race war it's very very
[33:46.240 --> 33:49.800]  dangerous as the president has said now this is a eight and a half minute

[34:13.560 --> 34:18.600]  report admitting it happened and then this video has congressional testimony of
[34:18.600 --> 34:22.160]  children that were kidnapped and then put into mind control by the government
[34:22.160 --> 34:26.600]  Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber was in MKUltra most of these people are
[34:26.600 --> 34:31.880]  mind-controlled programmed to be assassins mass shooters and this report
[34:31.880 --> 34:39.720]  has it from C-SPAN. Do you understand ladies and gentlemen unbelievable so you
[34:39.720 --> 34:43.320]  want to know the rest of the story on Epstein he was only one piece of it here
[34:43.320 --> 34:48.200]  is the powerful report that will only get past the censors if you spread it so
[34:48.200 --> 34:52.920]  you've got your mission take action info warriors. I want to thank each and every
[34:52.920 --> 34:58.600]  one of you for coming out here tonight to arm yourselves with knowledge about a
[34:58.600 --> 35:04.280]  tool that's being covertly used to usher in what Adolf Hitler and George Bush
[35:04.280 --> 35:10.880]  term new world order and that's mind control. A new world order a world where
[35:10.880 --> 35:17.080]  the rule of law not the law the jungle governs the conduct of nations. Trauma
[35:17.080 --> 35:22.440]  based mind control can be traced back for millennia but we can find its research
[35:22.440 --> 35:27.840]  in modern times in the Tavistock Institute of London and the Kaiser
[35:27.840 --> 35:33.960]  Wilhelm Institute of Germany. The Nazis were studying occult families engaged
[35:33.960 --> 35:40.200]  in multi-generational sexual abuse of children. They found that abused children
[35:40.200 --> 35:45.280]  were receptive to external mind control and could develop enhanced physical
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.880]  abilities such as photographic memory physical stamina and up to 44 times
[35:50.880 --> 35:57.080]  visual acuity. They were raising children in laboratories to create a super race
[35:57.080 --> 36:04.080]  of humans. Operation paperclip was a secret program where the U.S. imported
[36:04.080 --> 36:09.960]  more than 1600 Nazi scientists after World War II some of whom went on to
[36:09.960 --> 36:16.040]  continue their work in trauma-based mind control. This information first made its
[36:16.040 --> 36:21.880]  way into the public on August 3rd 1977 during congressional hearings into the
[36:21.880 --> 36:28.800]  CIA's MK ultra mind control program. It is interesting to note that Dr. Lewis
[36:28.800 --> 36:35.520]  Julian West a leading expert in the CIA's MK ultra program was also the lead
[36:35.520 --> 36:42.560]  psychiatrist for Jack Ruby, Patty Hearst, Sirhan Sirhan and Oklahoma City
[36:42.560 --> 36:50.800]  bomber Timothy McVeigh. In 1988 CIA agent Mark Phillips rescued
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.960]  Kathy O'Brien from the MK ultra program. They provided documented testimony for
[36:56.960 --> 37:01.040]  the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Intelligence oversight in
[37:01.040 --> 37:07.440]  1995 but for reasons of national security she was not able to address the
[37:07.440 --> 37:13.480]  congressional committee so she became a whistleblower. I was born in 1957 in
[37:13.480 --> 37:20.320]  Muskegon, Michigan to a multi-generational incest-based family. This means my father
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.520]  was sexually abused as a child my mother was sexually abused as a child and
[37:24.520 --> 37:30.120]  they were sexually abusing me. The sexual abuse that I was enduring was so
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.600]  horrific that I developed dissociative identity disorder. It certainly was
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.880]  incomprehensible there was no place for it in my mind to deal with such horror.
[37:40.880 --> 37:47.120]  Therefore I developed a compartment in my brain a little area behind amnesic
[37:47.120 --> 37:51.120]  barriers that was actually the neuron pathway shutting down in my brain in
[37:51.120 --> 37:56.040]  order to compartmentalize the memory of abuse so that the rest of my mind could
[37:56.040 --> 38:00.120]  function normally as though nothing had happened. This criminal faction of our
[38:00.120 --> 38:05.920]  government was so interested in dissociative identity disorder persons
[38:05.920 --> 38:13.440]  they knew that any child that was subject subjected to child pornography had
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.760]  to have endured trauma so horrible that they had to be suffering from that
[38:18.760 --> 38:25.440]  disorder therefore this criminal faction of our government sanctioned this child
[38:25.440 --> 38:30.000]  pornography ring so that they could identify and target children such as
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.080]  myself for the project. Whistleblower Bryce Taylor has made very similar claims.
[38:37.080 --> 38:43.080]  Kathy O'Brien claimed that her handler former Klansman and senator Robert
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.760]  Byrd was in complete control of her and directed her to have sex with powerful
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.800]  members of society and politics including Bill and Hillary Clinton. It was my
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.840]  experience that Bill Clinton is bisexual leaning far more towards a
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.120]  homosexual and all I've ever seen him involved in was the homosexual activity
[39:04.120 --> 39:10.160]  with very limited experience with him myself whereas my experience was much
[39:10.160 --> 39:15.800]  more prevalent with Hillary Clinton because Hillary is also bisexual leaning
[39:15.800 --> 39:23.760]  more towards a homosexual and it was she who accessed my sex programming to
[39:23.760 --> 39:30.000]  fulfill her perversions. In 1995 President Bill Clinton's advisory committee on
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  human radiation experimentation included testimonies from Congress from child
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.280]  victims involved in trauma-based mind control who claimed they were tortured
[39:40.280 --> 39:45.600]  and kept in cages when they were small children. I was a subject in radiation as
[39:45.600 --> 39:51.000]  well as mind control and drug experiments performed by a man I knew as Dr.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.360]  Green. His objective was to gain control of my mind and train me to be a spy
[39:56.360 --> 40:01.000]  assassin. I was in what looked like a laboratory and there seemed to be other
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.560]  children. I was strapped down naked spread eagle on a table on my back. Dr.
[40:07.560 --> 40:11.760]  Green moved on to wanting me to kill dolls that looked like real children. He
[40:11.760 --> 40:16.040]  often tied me down in a cage which was near his office and claimed they were
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.680]  used to sexually blackmail powerful politicians when they were only nine
[40:20.680 --> 40:25.040]  years old. I became a pawn in the government scheme whose ultimate goal was
[40:25.040 --> 40:29.680]  mind control and to create the perfect spy. All for the use of chemicals,
[40:29.680 --> 40:36.240]  radiation, drugs, hypnosis, electric shock, isolation in tubs of water, sleep
[40:36.240 --> 40:42.640]  deprivation, brainwashing, verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse. I can only
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.840]  summarize my circumstances by saying they took an already abused seven-year-old
[40:46.840 --> 40:53.000]  child and compounded my suffering beyond belief. The saddest part is I know for a
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  fact that I was not alone. There were countless other children in my same
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.200]  situation and there was no one to help us. I was sent to a lodge in Maryland
[41:02.200 --> 41:07.080]  called Deep Creek Cabins to learn how to sexually please men. I was taught how to
[41:07.080 --> 41:11.720]  coerce them into talking about themselves and it was Dr. Richard Helms
[41:11.720 --> 41:19.680]  who was deputy director of the CIA, Dr. Gottlieb, Captain George White, Morris Allen
[41:19.680 --> 41:25.320]  who all planned on filming as many high government and agency officials and heads
[41:25.320 --> 41:31.240]  of academic institutions and foundations as possible. I was used to
[41:31.240 --> 41:36.120]  entrap many unwitting men including themselves. All for the use of a hidden
[41:36.120 --> 41:39.680]  house. Okay let's fade this down. We got to go to break. I want to come back and
[41:39.680 --> 41:42.840]  finish with this and I want to explain something. Greg reached a great job. He
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.120]  found congressional testimony video of this but I want to add something. It's
[41:47.120 --> 41:50.360]  in the report that Bill Clinton obnoxiously gets up and admits and
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.080]  apologizes for when clearly he's been involved in all this. It's now come out.
[41:54.080 --> 41:57.160]  He's like you got to know your government's gonna take care of you. We're
[41:57.160 --> 42:03.720]  sorry about this. These people were confirmed to be in the program and so
[42:03.720 --> 42:06.440]  we're gonna do a part two on this that that should be done middle of week
[42:06.440 --> 42:09.120]  because I even pulled it up myself last night because I remember all this
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.960]  research. People ask how I know all this. It's public. Over 10,000 foster
[42:13.960 --> 42:20.440]  children were taken by Ewing Cameron, Dr. Ewing Cameron and Jolly and West. This
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.960]  is declassified. They've had history channel shows about it 20 years ago.
[42:24.960 --> 42:29.640]  They don't put that on anymore but it was declassified. That they would do
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.760]  electroshock, wipe out their memories and put them on drugs for them six months
[42:33.760 --> 42:37.080]  with audio programming going in. So they were totally new people with
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.600]  different personalities that you can put information into. Then you could send
[42:40.600 --> 42:43.720]  them to the Soviet Union to infiltrate. No one would know. Someone knows the
[42:43.720 --> 42:47.480]  keyword. It opens up the new personality. The brain's an incredible computer and
[42:47.480 --> 42:52.960]  this is just a form of genetic, organic, cybernetics. But it's all based on
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.200]  trauma. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.480]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public
[43:02.480 --> 43:05.880]  square. The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.920]  network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate
[43:09.920 --> 43:13.440]  sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by
[43:13.440 --> 43:16.720]  secrets foreign government. It is completely independent of all that. It is
[43:16.720 --> 43:21.360]  an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[43:21.360 --> 43:24.800]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so
[43:24.800 --> 43:28.240]  concerned with. At the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[43:28.240 --> 43:31.960]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[43:31.960 --> 43:34.960]  wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[43:34.960 --> 43:38.160]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.000]  able to control and manipulate what news and views view a person's allowed to
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.080]  have or express or hear and the Info Wars audience has broken through that. They
[43:46.080 --> 43:50.360]  are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American
[43:50.360 --> 43:53.720]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[43:53.720 --> 43:57.960]  of the platforming, defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[43:57.960 --> 44:04.760]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee and
[44:04.760 --> 44:10.280]  luckily our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stock full of high
[44:10.280 --> 44:16.080]  quality Info Wars store Patriot Blend coffee. Grown in the high mountains of

[44:29.960 --> 44:35.680]  acidity. There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars, so

[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  Hey Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.440]  people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.360]  nobody agrees with these wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately
[45:13.360 --> 45:17.440]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they
[45:17.440 --> 45:21.360]  could defeat him in the eyes of the public. The approaching 2020. That's it. I
[45:21.360 --> 45:24.560]  mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way
[45:24.560 --> 45:27.360]  I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be
[45:27.360 --> 45:30.680]  praying my friend. I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is
[45:30.680 --> 45:34.440]  I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man. I
[45:34.440 --> 45:38.040]  would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what
[45:38.040 --> 45:41.720]  you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone
[45:41.720 --> 45:46.120]  into this war. You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like
[45:46.120 --> 45:49.600]  myself and many others who are gonna continue. We're gonna keep fighting in
[45:49.600 --> 45:53.440]  the Info War and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a
[45:53.440 --> 45:57.560]  fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you sir for
[45:57.560 --> 46:03.600]  calling. Without your support we won't be here and I couldn't thank you all
[46:03.600 --> 46:06.560]  enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game. I mean I want to stay in
[46:06.560 --> 46:09.760]  this game. I want to take the globalist on. Total transparency is our whole
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.840]  operation. If I bring in $35 million half of that's the cost of the products
[46:13.840 --> 46:17.400]  we don't mark stuff up that much. I don't care if I'm not making money but you
[46:17.400 --> 46:21.160]  need to buy the products. We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got
[46:21.160 --> 46:24.840]  great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus but ultimate
[46:24.840 --> 46:28.200]  krill oil has been sold out for four months. For whatever reason this became
[46:28.200 --> 46:32.280]  the most popular fish oil. It's totally full of bottle and it is the strongest
[46:32.280 --> 46:36.480]  purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it put
[46:36.480 --> 46:41.040]  through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury. Any type of krill oil
[46:41.040 --> 46:44.600]  you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but gives you all
[46:44.600 --> 46:47.680]  the great benefits, isn't real. It's been boiled, it's been reeled, it's been
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.240]  homogenized. This is not it. This ladies and gentlemen is the highest quality krill
[46:52.240 --> 46:56.240]  oil you're gonna find anywhere. Real krill oil folks is red. It's not yellow, it's
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.400]  not milky. This is nothing but krill oil.
[47:00.400 --> 47:11.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:15.400 --> 47:21.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[47:21.600 --> 47:43.600]  you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[47:43.600 --> 47:48.160]  So the report is up on infowars.com. Congressional testimony from Clinton
[47:48.160 --> 47:52.760]  there reveals pedophile blackmail network. And now of course that makes a
[47:52.760 --> 47:57.200]  lot more sense doesn't it? But Jeffrey Epstein, oh he had all these famous
[47:57.200 --> 48:03.440]  scientists and famous foundation heads and he was getting them to the Albert
[48:03.440 --> 48:08.080]  Einstein Institute and then he was taking them to these big hotel like
[48:08.080 --> 48:14.240]  compounds in New Mexico and in New York and all over the world and in the
[48:14.240 --> 48:18.400]  Mediterranean Caribbean. Oh it's all coming out not just here but in Europe.
[48:18.400 --> 48:22.720]  And then you just heard congressional testimony of young women when they were
[48:22.720 --> 48:28.520]  children age eight program drugged electroshocked to service the heads of
[48:28.520 --> 48:35.040]  academia and the heads of government to compromise them for the criminal group
[48:35.040 --> 48:41.080]  that had taken over the central intelligence agency. So here here's that
[48:41.080 --> 48:47.240]  video. On who all planned on filming as many high government agency officials
[48:47.240 --> 48:53.560]  and heads of academic institutions and foundations as possible. I was used to
[48:53.560 --> 48:58.440]  attract many unwitting men including themselves all with the use of a hidden
[48:58.440 --> 49:08.800]  camera. I was only nine years old. After the hearings Bill Clinton began his
[49:08.800 --> 49:14.160]  speech with the NLP technique the three-time convencer. That at the very
[49:14.160 --> 49:19.200]  least they could trust the United States government to tell the truth and to do
[49:19.200 --> 49:24.840]  the right things. None of these efforts can succeed unless people believe that
[49:24.840 --> 49:29.080]  they can rely on their government to tell the truth and to do the right thing.
[49:29.080 --> 49:33.560]  And to all those who represent the families who have been involved in
[49:33.560 --> 49:39.880]  these incidents let me say to you I hope you feel that your government has kept
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.120]  its commitment to the American people to tell the truth and to do the right
[49:44.120 --> 49:50.000]  thing. He offered an apology to the victims and financial compensation but
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.560]  there was no investigation and no media coverage of the child victim testimony.
[49:56.560 --> 50:03.560]  Jeffrey Epstein is nothing new. Epstein was just a spoke in an ancient wheel.
[50:03.560 --> 50:10.720]  Keith Raniere was running the same operation with the Nixxiom Cult. It
[50:10.720 --> 50:18.520]  runs through Hollywood, our government, pop culture and our universities. If we
[50:18.520 --> 50:25.960]  cannot change this then the corruption we see in politics will never change. For
[50:25.960 --> 50:30.040]  InfoWars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[50:36.520 --> 50:40.680]  And welcome back ladies and gentlemen. Again I think you might want to get that
[50:40.680 --> 50:44.840]  report out to your friends, your family, your email list, your text message. I
[50:44.840 --> 50:48.760]  know they tell you don't promote Alex Jones or bad things will happen and
[50:48.760 --> 50:52.440]  what will your family say if you're promoting this evil guy that's exposed
[50:52.440 --> 50:56.360]  all of this. The truth is I'd love to tell you that I'm some super rocket
[50:56.360 --> 51:03.060]  scientist. I just made it my point of study to study the real history of the
[51:03.060 --> 51:07.720]  world, the real history of the US and how these criminal networks operate and
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.040]  these criminal networks are operating all over the world because they're
[51:11.040 --> 51:15.600]  psychopaths and they can find an army of sociopaths that will serve them and
[51:15.600 --> 51:21.720]  they're very emotionalists. They're very cold-blooded. See I'm very very hot but I
[51:21.720 --> 51:27.360]  really care. I'm really upset by this because if you let these people run
[51:27.360 --> 51:33.040]  things we are as culture dead and we are spiritual creatures and that means
[51:33.040 --> 51:37.080]  these evil people are being put in charge by a very wicked force that
[51:37.080 --> 51:42.200]  formulaically tortures children, that formulaically corrupts others and then
[51:42.200 --> 51:47.320]  externalizes its method. Other stacks of news today. They're down to five-year-olds
[51:47.320 --> 51:52.600]  now that strip dance at gay bars. Well they're pedophile bars. They are human
[51:52.600 --> 51:56.200]  animal clones all over the place. It's all being announced. Just killing
[51:56.200 --> 52:03.320]  babies after they're born. It's all just being thrown in our face to sear our
[52:03.320 --> 52:10.840]  conscience and to train us and prepare us to put up with even greater horrors. And
[52:10.840 --> 52:15.120]  now we see groups of armed goons strutting around the United States and
[52:15.120 --> 52:18.840]  Europe beating up people that have their nation's flags and people that believe
[52:18.840 --> 52:22.160]  in sovereignty and people that oppose the globalists and you openly have the
[52:22.160 --> 52:28.000]  Chinese government financing Hollywood and financing the left and financing
[52:28.000 --> 52:34.720]  demoralizing our country with this vicious poisonous venom that is their
[52:34.720 --> 52:38.440]  system and the average person is more lonely. The average person has less
[52:38.440 --> 52:43.560]  friends. The average person has a lower IQ. I know so many people personally now
[52:43.560 --> 52:48.120]  that used to be smart who are like in a mesmerized state. People are either
[52:48.120 --> 52:52.560]  getting more awake and more alive or they're becoming more and more under the
[52:52.560 --> 52:58.880]  spell. What is a spell? An ancient name for a trance. An ancient name for being
[52:58.880 --> 53:08.840]  hypnotized. Being programmed. Being under their sway. Humanity is being taken out of
[53:08.840 --> 53:14.600]  this natural environment not to empower it but to destroy it. And the globalists
[53:14.600 --> 53:17.920]  admit they want a one-world government transhumanist gods they're going to
[53:17.920 --> 53:23.760]  worship. There's a post-human era we have to get rid of the humans before we
[53:23.760 --> 53:28.060]  transcend and become gods. We're told this in childhoods end written in the
[53:28.060 --> 53:36.440]  1950s by a luminous and MI6 and OSS high-level initiate and then you just
[53:36.440 --> 53:41.840]  move on from there they're telling you that everybody has to die before you
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.680]  merge and become gods. And then when Epstein and the island and the fact that
[53:46.680 --> 53:50.680]  he had all the foundation heads they were into eugenics and transhumanism and
[53:50.680 --> 53:56.480]  and master races and breeding and underground bunkers will go watch Dr.
[53:56.480 --> 54:02.400]  Strangelove 1964. The CIA came to Stanley Kubrick and said how do you know
[54:02.400 --> 54:08.160]  about plan R and how do you know about the machine that gives them the orders
[54:08.160 --> 54:15.680]  when the radio frequencies hit it? And Kubrick told him I'm psychic. I've seen
[54:15.680 --> 54:20.040]  he's a remote viewer and I'm not talking about the fake remote viewers out there.
[54:20.040 --> 54:23.720]  I've talked to the family I've talked to others. Kubrick was not going to the
[54:23.720 --> 54:29.640]  Satanic rituals. Kubrick was not seeing the you know nuclear attack plan
[54:29.640 --> 54:38.160]  scramblers. He was literally envisioning it. I was told that by his daughter and
[54:38.160 --> 54:43.320]  I already knew that from people at the Pentagon and and he was so psychic that
[54:43.320 --> 54:49.160]  he just couldn't be around people anymore. It went hidden the countryside of
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.400]  England because Kubrick picked up on everything else that everybody else was
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.680]  doing and they tried to recruit him but they didn't get him because Kubrick
[54:58.680 --> 55:04.280]  wouldn't be involved in the abuse of children. And boy did they come after him
[55:04.280 --> 55:08.400]  because they wanted him to be on their team. That's what the shining is all
[55:08.400 --> 55:14.320]  about is there's a hotel that's psychically possessed and there's an
[55:14.320 --> 55:16.800]  old black man that doesn't even know this family but he's having psychic
[55:16.800 --> 55:21.240]  inclination. He's got to go to that hotel and stop what was about to happen. So
[55:21.240 --> 55:24.760]  everything Kubrick's telling you is what he experienced. In truth is the
[55:24.760 --> 55:28.960]  globalist know there's this internet of the mind. They know that psychic powers
[55:28.960 --> 55:33.720]  are real and they know that everybody has them to a certain extent and that's
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.160]  our connection to the spiritual. God's real, the devil's real, the dimensions
[55:37.160 --> 55:41.160]  are all real and they want to get children when they're young, torture the
[55:41.160 --> 55:46.120]  hell out of them so they form multiple personalities that they can then program
[55:46.120 --> 55:52.640]  and control. And that's only part of it ladies and gentlemen and now these very
[55:52.640 --> 55:59.360]  same wicked, wicked globalists are trying to start a race war in this
[55:59.360 --> 56:04.720]  country and they're outlawed by communist China that again will do any human
[56:04.720 --> 56:11.120]  cloning, any genetic manipulation, humanoids killing a hundred plus
[56:11.120 --> 56:16.720]  million of their own people. The sky's the limit with these people. They admire
[56:16.720 --> 56:21.840]  those who were totally wicked and devoid of any basic decency and that will do
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.360]  anything. I suggest if you're watching and listening you realize the enemy wants
[56:27.360 --> 56:32.000]  this off the air because we're telling you the truth and we're here for a
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.280]  reason. There's not just evil in this universe, there's good as well. You've
[56:35.280 --> 56:39.480]  got my full commitment that I'm the opposite of a psychopath. I a hundred
[56:39.480 --> 56:45.080]  percent feel all of this and I can't stand it and I can see what the globalist
[56:45.080 --> 56:48.720]  are up to in my own eyes, my own political understanding, my own geopolitical
[56:48.720 --> 56:54.360]  research, my own historical grasp, my own street smarts but there's another element
[56:54.360 --> 57:02.400]  to it. I can see them. I see their operations. So while they're in case of
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.120]  their fortresses and they're trying to build an omnipresent grid to survey us
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.040]  and know our dreams, if we just know God we already know all our dreams. We're
[57:12.040 --> 57:19.360]  already on that stairway to enlightenment. We're already touching God's foot and
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.440]  the enemy is enraged by that because they're cut off from God and they can't
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.360]  stand it. So they want to grab children and rape them and torture them and turn
[57:27.360 --> 57:33.120]  them into little robot slaves but they may program the mind. They can't touch
[57:33.120 --> 57:39.080]  that soul. We'll be back with our number two of the global transmission infowars.com
[57:39.080 --> 57:43.840]  newswars.com. Joe Begg's triumphant with the great folks in Portland. All the
[57:43.840 --> 57:48.200]  backstory on that. Hour two. You don't want to miss it. Hillary hopes you do.
[57:48.200 --> 57:53.760]  Ladies and gentlemen this isn't a Netflix drama show. This isn't a law and order
[57:53.760 --> 57:58.080]  TV program. This is reality. I'll say this. It's all of our birthright. Black,
[57:58.080 --> 58:01.920]  white, old, young, gay, straight. We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[58:01.920 --> 58:05.440]  We're seeing election meddling and it's time to admit it and to realize we've
[58:05.440 --> 58:09.320]  seen a giant backdoor power grab. They didn't come like an enemy from over the
[58:09.320 --> 58:13.760]  horizon. They came from inside and they came through cyberspace. Our Republic,
[58:13.760 --> 58:17.680]  our constitutional little d-democracy has been hacked. And please remember without
[58:17.680 --> 58:21.560]  your financial support we wouldn't have stood this withering storm of censorship,
[58:21.560 --> 58:26.240]  attacks and lies. We have the new World Awakens mega sale, globalist house of
[58:26.240 --> 58:30.560]  cards collapsing end of summer super sale. It's the big giant 50 to 60% off
[58:30.560 --> 58:35.560]  store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, but only on 50-something items, not on
[58:35.560 --> 58:38.360]  every item because a bunch of these are very close to selling out. Whether it's
[58:38.360 --> 58:41.800]  ultimate Krill oil, bodies, turmeric, brain force plus, knockout sleeping,
[58:41.800 --> 58:46.360]  herbophores, eight-pack power stack. It's all 50 to 60% off and your purchases
[58:46.360 --> 58:49.080]  make it all possible here.
[58:49.080 --> 58:54.840]  Tyler. Yes. I got a plug for the Patriot points. I get $180 so far this year and I
[58:54.840 --> 58:58.560]  feel like I'm stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because I mean I don't
[58:58.560 --> 59:00.760]  want to give that money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people
[59:00.760 --> 59:03.760]  who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in. So I'd rather give that
[59:03.760 --> 59:06.280]  money to you and then get in quality products. The products that I do
[59:06.280 --> 59:10.440]  receive have changed my life. I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me. I've
[59:10.440 --> 59:14.000]  lost weight. My brain works a whole lot better. I think my kids, they use the
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.960]  toothpaste. My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in
[59:17.960 --> 59:20.200]  water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[59:20.200 --> 59:23.800]  Well, let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in there. I want a
[59:23.800 --> 59:27.720]  good price, but I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when
[59:27.720 --> 59:31.560]  it's 50% off. I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same
[59:31.560 --> 59:35.080]  thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you so much for
[59:35.080 --> 59:38.840]  the plugs but listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes
[59:38.840 --> 59:42.120]  things a loss later because if you're already getting 10% off because you're
[59:42.120 --> 59:46.000]  on auto-ship then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that where
[59:46.000 --> 59:50.400]  you have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's okay. Thanks for the support.
[59:50.400 --> 59:57.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.880 --> 1:00:20.960]  So in the last two segments, we showed you congressional testimony in a U.S.
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:25.760]  government inspector general report admitting that children were radiated.
[1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:30.240]  In some cases, the death, you know, all about the injecting black people with
[1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:35.040]  syphilis. But the ski experiment, it turned out they were injecting everybody
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:38.200]  else with it as well, but they thought, put it out, we're doing for blacks first
[1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:42.120]  and it won't be as big a deal. Talk about institutional racism, get me
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:45.960]  somebody with that, but oh, they're the liberals. They're the institutional
[1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:51.880]  government officials. But coming up, we're gonna have Joe Big John after a
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:56.880]  really great success yesterday and in a close look at anti-fund and the crimes
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:00:59.640]  they committed and the fact that even AP had to admit that they were the violent
[1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:06.560]  ones, the worm is turning very, very quickly. But expanding on that, remember
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:11.160]  when the media tells you not to look at Epstein being murdered. We just told
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:14.840]  you he would be hung in a cell probably 50 times. He would talk about their
[1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:21.040]  betting on it in Europe and England where it's legal to bet on anything. But
[1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:25.200]  now, even though you've got forensic pathologists coming out saying, oh, look,
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:28.200]  this is indicative of murder, even though you've got the stand down and new
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:34.480]  jail guards brought in and all the rest of it, why see it in an MSM and the rest
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:41.320]  of them are telling you, don't you dare think he got murdered. This all smacks of
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:49.600]  desperation and a threat to those that they were afraid will speak out. It's a
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:54.360]  message. So here's part of that bull down. Trump has reacted to Epstein's death in
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:59.240]  what is sadly a very unsurprising way. He is spreading a conspiracy theory.
[1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:03.480]  Tying the death of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in prison to the president's
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:07.680]  former political rivals, the Clintons. The president retweeting a theory without
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:12.840]  evidence that implicates the Clintons in Epstein's death. Let that sink in. This
[1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:17.040]  would be like Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan claiming that LBJ had
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:21.160]  Kennedy's help. Now the president is helping to spread an outrageous full
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:25.920]  story about Epstein's death being tied to the Kintons. Shortly after Jeffrey
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:30.880]  Epstein was found dead in his jail cell, President Trump retweeted this video from
[1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:36.360]  a conservative commentator. For some odd reason, people that have information on
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:41.400]  the Clintons end up dead and they usually die from suicide. It's appalling. I
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:46.440]  mean, there's no other way to put it. You have the president of the United
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:52.920]  States retweeting an unfounded conspiracy theory with no evidence
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:57.600]  to back it up about a former president of the United States. We have a president
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:03.480]  now whose Twitter feed is a chief source of disinformation. This is another
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:09.600]  example of our president using this position of public trust to attack his
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:14.440]  political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories. Some extraordinary
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:44.440]  conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories.

[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:48.760]  But there is no evidence at all
[1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:50.440]  to support the conspiracy theory.
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:51.640]  The president is fueling.
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:53.640]  Marco Rubio says there is evidence.
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:56.480]  Russian bots are now pushing this new conspiracy theory
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:03:59.040]  online to further divide Americans.
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:02.440]  All three of us, if we tweeted stuff like this
[1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:05.720]  in this reckless fashion, we would likely lose our jobs.
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:09.800]  Bathhouse Rubio totally compromised.
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:11.400]  There's nothing wrong with the fact that, you know,
[1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:12.320]  he's been lighting the loafers.
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:13.880]  It just shouldn't be compromised.
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:16.480]  Coming up later, I'll get into this whole graphic we have
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:18.400]  of the Clinton body count.
[1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:19.400]  But you heard CNN.
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:21.400]  They said, there's nothing backing that up.
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:23.240]  And then they didn't back that up.
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:25.160]  We back it all up.
[1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:28.400]  And no one is buying it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:30.320]  So it's not even the Clinton body count.
[1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:32.120]  The Clintons are just a tentacle.
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:33.840]  You know, like if the clown's really just a tentacle
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:35.920]  of a big intergalactic vampiric spider,
[1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:38.520]  and if the clown's just a tongue, like an anglerfish.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:39.760]  Oh, hi, I'm a clown.
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:41.320]  Hey, how you doing, Georgie?
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:42.240]  Ha, ha, ha.
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:43.080]  That's the Clintons.
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:45.560]  Oh, hi, I'm so liberal.
[1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:47.560]  I love you.
[1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:49.560]  Come closer, children.
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:53.040]  They're going to see a lot of stuffed clowns and balloons.
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:54.520]  And you'll float too.
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:57.360]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[1:05:51.160 --> 1:06:16.640]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:23.960]  You know, Yoda once said, for the Jedi,
[1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:30.400]  there is time to eat as well.
[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:33.120]  And that's fiction, and I'm here to tell you, as a patriot,
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:36.840]  there's time to celebrate our victories as well.
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:38.520]  And we should do that more.
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:40.760]  I want to just say something about Trump.
[1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:45.800]  If you could imagine the cultural and the spiritual
[1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:48.720]  and the psychic attack he's under,
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:51.800]  and how everyone around him, everyone that supports him,
[1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:58.040]  has been absolutely stalked and lied about and harassed
[1:06:58.040 --> 1:07:03.400]  and demonized and audited and indicted and killed,
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:05.120]  in some cases.
[1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:09.920]  So I really sit back at this instant gratification culture.
[1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:12.760]  And I get mad at Trump sometimes because I want to win.
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:16.120]  My engine over revs and I get mad at things he's done
[1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:18.200]  because it wasn't exactly how I do it.
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:22.280]  But the rage the globalists have for Trump,
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:24.600]  and they're pouring out of the tax and lies
[1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.800]  and their internal emails that come out and all of it, it's real.
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:33.720]  Trump is 100% for real.
[1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:43.160]  Now, Bengal Tiger, in the forest of northern areas of India,
[1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:45.440]  it's real too.
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:47.000]  It just means he's his own man.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.880]  He has his own vision.
[1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:51.560]  And he's pro-human.
[1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:52.160]  He's pro-human.
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.760]  He has that human destiny.
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:55.200]  He has that will.
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:58.720]  He wants to procreate, not just children, but success
[1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.800]  and feels his destiny tied to humanity because it is.
[1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:05.120]  Any real man wants prosperity.
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:07.880]  Any real man wants to empower others.
[1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:11.080]  Anyone that's confident and strong and virile
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:13.880]  doesn't look at weak people and want to kill them.
[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:15.280]  You want to empower them.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.160]  Oh, Trump's totally real.
[1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:26.080]  And he's got all the power, all the focus, all the psychic
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:30.920]  energy, all of the connectedness and the gut level
[1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:35.280]  subconscious supercomputer, that all these think tanks
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:37.800]  and all these collections of cowards and all these people
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:39.960]  who just run around and go where the wind blows
[1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:43.000]  and goes where the biggest paycheck comes from,
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.280]  they fear him.
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:48.520]  And that incredible Zinn statement he made,
[1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:49.200]  I'm paraphrasing.
[1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:50.560]  I'm trying to pull the quote up.
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:55.440]  Trump said, the deepest, the most important thing
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:59.440]  I ever realized in my life was that my first impressions are
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:06.040]  best and that being shallow is the deepest thing in my life.
[1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:07.640]  Now, I'm butchering and paraphrasing.
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:10.120]  Can you guys pull up Trump's quote on being shallow?
[1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:11.800]  That's all the genetic memory.
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:13.440]  That's all of the understanding.
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:15.640]  That's all of the first approximation
[1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:18.360]  of your supercomputer is the best analysis it's got.
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:23.440]  And then you're supposed to know that's the best analysis
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:25.800]  and then war game it and say, am I being deceived?
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:28.120]  Are they projecting something?
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:32.600]  But nine times out of 10, it's the gut that knows.
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:34.320]  Let me give you an example of this.
[1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:36.640]  I can sit there.
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.040]  I'm going to videotape this sometime.
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:41.040]  I mean, I've shown you me shooting coke cans at 500 yards
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:41.280]  and stuff.
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:42.720]  I mean, I'm a really good shot.
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:45.680]  But the point is, is that it's when I let go, I never miss.
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:48.480]  When I try, I miss.
[1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:51.320]  But I can sit there in my yard with a dart thing hanging
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:54.200]  on the tree and I'll put cans of, you know,
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:57.440]  like LaCroix soda water up there.
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.280]  And I'll say, watch this, I'm not going to try.
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:01.640]  30 feet, hit the can.
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:06.000]  I can try with 20 throws, focusing, can't hit the can.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.480]  I had Pat Raleigh over at the house last week
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:09.360]  and I said, watch this.
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:11.520]  The cat's sitting in the yard over there 40 feet away.
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.720]  I'm going to bounce this golf ball perfectly
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:14.960]  and hit the cat in the head.
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:17.400]  Not being mean, it has to be a live animal.
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:19.880]  There's some kind of connection to like that hunting energy
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:22.720]  we had and the geometry and the calculations.
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:24.600]  That it's something about hunting that needs to be live.
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:25.240]  It didn't hurt the cat.
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:26.320]  It kind of didn't hit the head.
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:28.640]  Even like at the back, but I was one inch off.
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:31.920]  And I bounced the ball perfectly, hit the cat.
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:34.400]  I said, now let's get the darts.
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:36.440]  And I was like Obi-Wan Kenobi talking to Luke Skywalker.
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:41.360]  And I said, don't try to hit the can.
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:43.640]  And as soon as he stopped trying, he hit the can.
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.400]  And I said, watch this through one time at the can.
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:48.360]  Let's just say Pat was impressed.
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:51.200]  But I'm not telling you all that to impress you,
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:53.640]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:55.680]  I'm telling you all that because the globalists
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:57.240]  know how powerful you are.
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:10:58.800]  You've all got that power.
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:02.040]  And it's not some mitochondrial DNA force stuff
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:03.480]  from Hollywood.
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:05.400]  They're just trying to create a cosmology
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:07.680]  that you already instinctively know about yourself
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:09.600]  so that you believe they're giving you all the answers,
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:13.080]  because you already had the answers.
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:16.560]  Humans thousands of years ago envisioned flying machines.
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:19.040]  We built them.
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:22.280]  People 200 years ago envisioned DNA and computers.
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:28.640]  We built them because we envisioned them.
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:30.400]  That's why most of these globalists and people
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:31.800]  think, oh, we must have been seated here
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:33.080]  and given a program to do this.
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:34.720]  How do we already know all this?
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:38.520]  It's because we already are dialed into the whole universe.
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:40.200]  I'm going to go to Bray and come back with Joe Biggs
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:42.840]  the rest of the hour, and I appreciate him joining us.
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:45.000]  But I want to talk about some of the successes of humanity
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.080]  and then realize the losers that have seized control
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:51.960]  of the planet, they're yesterday's news very, very soon.
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:55.280]  They're not going to stand in the way of humanity.
[1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:56.160]  It's going to be rough.
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:00.240]  It's going to be tough, but I'm telling you,
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:02.120]  we're going to make it through this with God's help.
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:03.160]  Now, let me give you the good news.
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:05.840]  We go to Bray and come back with Joe Biggs.
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:07.400]  Your TV viewer, look at that photo.
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:15.320]  That photo was up for today on DrudgeReport.com.
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:17.840]  Can we go full screen with the HD of it?
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:20.360]  And it looks like something that
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:23.720]  has that iconography of when they raised the flag
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:25.400]  the Marines do over Iwo Jima.
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:27.480]  And I'm not comparing what the Proud Boys
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:28.280]  and others did to that.
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:29.520]  They wouldn't either.
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:33.360]  But it has that same true Americana flair.
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:35.040]  And I sat there because I have a Getty's account.
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:37.160]  We pay for it.
[1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:39.000]  And I spent about 30 minutes last night
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.200]  looking at hundreds of photos, and they were all so iconic.
[1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:43.560]  The people all were smiling.
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:44.280]  They were happy.
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:44.960]  They were black.
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:45.720]  They were Hispanic.
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:46.320]  They were white.
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:46.840]  They were old.
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:47.560]  They were young.
[1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:50.760]  But let me tell you something, they were men.
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:54.080]  And they had a camaraderie and a joyousness,
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:55.840]  even though they'd been told by the feds you're
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:57.240]  going to get arrested and by Portland police
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:58.160]  we're going to come after you.
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:00.280]  And they knew that there was three or four times all
[1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:04.240]  the meth head, government employees, scumbag, professors,
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:07.680]  waiting with poles and weapons and pepper spray and all of it.
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:09.720]  But they knew they were just going to march in,
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:12.280]  plant the American flag, exercise their First Amendment
[1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:15.080]  in defiance of the tyrants.
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:18.600]  And you look at that photo, they marched in there
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:21.280]  and they planted that flag in the middle of the park
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:26.120]  and let Antifa know we stand for the First Amendment
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:28.120]  and you will not silence us, you bullies.
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:35.160]  Then they marched back across the bridge to another state
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:37.400]  and they went and had a barbecue and had a great time
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:38.600]  together.
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:40.640]  And that's what it's all about, is having a good time
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:43.160]  at the same time and not letting the enemy grind us down
[1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:46.800]  or grind us down.
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:49.160]  And even AP, I'll cover this when we come back,
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:52.960]  had to admit, OK, the proud boys didn't attack anybody.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.080]  They were gentlemen.
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:55.840]  The left attacked them.
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:58.800]  And the left attacked anybody.
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:02.560]  The AP says anybody that they thought
[1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:03.960]  might be a Trump supporter.
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:06.000]  They just, anybody walking down to a grocery store
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.520]  with an American flag hat got punched in the face.
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:10.280]  You think about that.
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:14.920]  Gangs of thugs running around delusional believing
[1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:18.760]  they're fighting the Nazis when they weren't black,
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:20.160]  like the Nazis.
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:23.680]  They worked for George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:25.080]  I've got all these videos coming up
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:27.960]  with them attacking little girls chasing families down
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:31.360]  like wolves, it's horrifying.
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:35.600]  You watch orcs chasing down hobbits in a Lord of the Rings.
[1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:38.960]  It's fiction, but you still are on the hobbit's side.
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:42.920]  This was really happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:45.320]  These people have no bottom.
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:49.440]  They tasered and threw bottles at a little girl,
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:50.760]  but the taser didn't go in.
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.760]  And that's in the news.
[1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:59.000]  10-year-old girls being tasered by the anti-fascist
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.560]  and then all the big news channels other than AP
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:06.720]  ABC, NBC, CNN, all saying, oh, oh, the Nazis came
[1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:08.760]  and we were all nonviolent and they attacked us.
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:11.120]  They had signs up saying the Nazis are coming to kill you.
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:17.880]  And then the people attacking were attacking brown people
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:19.960]  and white people and black people.
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:24.960]  There was a guy right there, Hispanic fellow, pepper spray.
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:26.600]  And the weird thing about anti-fascists,
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:28.560]  they're such cowards, they always target people
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:30.960]  in wheelchairs or in the streets.
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:33.760]  Target people in wheelchairs or on crushes or children.
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:39.240]  Imagine being so soulless that you have no form of God fear.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:41.760]  And they're compelled to attack children instead
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:45.200]  of compelled to protect children because that's their ethos.
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:46.160]  It's their engine.
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:47.240]  It's their spirit.
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:49.400]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:51.240]  And if they can destroy the children,
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:53.040]  they believe they've destroyed the future.

[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:01.000]  And I couldn't thank you all enough

[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:03.880]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:05.240]  I want to take the globalist on.
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:07.200]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:09.200]  If I bring in $35 million,
[1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:10.880]  half of that's the cost of the products
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:12.360]  because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:13.920]  I don't care if I'm not making money,
[1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:15.360]  but you need to buy the products.
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:17.760]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric,
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:18.720]  we got great toothpaste.
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:21.120]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus,
[1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:23.760]  but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months.
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:26.280]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:27.760]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:30.160]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil.
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:32.240]  And it cost us three times more
[1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:33.600]  because we have it put through
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:36.840]  the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:38.240]  Any type of krill oil you get
[1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:39.880]  that doesn't give you fish burps,
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:42.080]  which I don't like but gives you all the great benefits,
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:42.920]  isn't real.
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:45.000]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:45.920]  This has not been.
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:49.400]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:50.360]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:52.120]  Real krill oil folks is red.
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:53.680]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:55.480]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:59.280]  Looking for a way to support Alex Jones

[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:56.360]  the Infowars Store has to offer.
[1:18:56.360 --> 1:19:00.800]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:03.040]  that when our Republic was in trouble in the future,
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:05.400]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground,
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:08.080]  close to reality, who actually worked for a living
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:09.520]  that would end up saving the nation.
[1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:11.120]  And today the Communist Chinese
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:14.160]  have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:16.880]  And we've seen massive increases in polls
[1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:18.520]  to support for the President
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:20.160]  and what he's doing in this trade war
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:23.080]  once China put pressure on our farmers.
[1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:24.040]  That's beautiful.
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:26.000]  Americans aren't gonna be bullied
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:27.520]  and we aren't gonna back down.
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:30.720]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:32.320]  of the world that wanna intimidate people
[1:19:32.320 --> 1:19:35.200]  and tell us to back down, we're never gonna give up.
[1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:37.600]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:41.720]  The human spirit lives at infowarst.com and newswarst.com.
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:44.000]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do,
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.600]  spread those links because we are the light
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:48.640]  and the dark of the night, we are the resistance.
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:51.200]  We are 1776, worldwide.
[1:19:51.200 --> 1:20:16.280]  Welcome back to this live Sunday, August 18, 2019,
[1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:18.160]  global transmission.
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:21.200]  For watching on TV, you see this key infographic,
[1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:23.360]  Clinton body count, hasn't been updated
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:25.440]  with Jeffrey Epstein or thousands of others,
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:27.360]  but it's in the hundreds.
[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:29.560]  You look at the really big lists that are out there.
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:33.640]  Ah, but forensic pathologists says Epstein's fractures
[1:20:33.640 --> 1:20:35.680]  are the mark of murder.
[1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:38.800]  Only 29% of Americans believe that he committed suicide.
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:42.720]  Epstein prison guards not cooperating with the DOJ,
[1:20:42.720 --> 1:20:45.160]  they were held in the city run facility.
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:50.600]  Let's see an incest, Bob Barr, Robert Barr.
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:54.600]  They're saying the attorney general is the guy
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:55.400]  that's gotta be looked at.
[1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:56.320]  Always say Bob Barr.
[1:20:56.320 --> 1:21:01.240]  It's a, I want to go to our guest here.
[1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:05.960]  I want to go to Joe Biggs and if you're a TV viewer,
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:09.680]  again, let's put full screen this iconic photo,
[1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:13.560]  beautiful old glory, designed by George Washington,
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:16.720]  and sewed together by Betsy Ross,
[1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:19.200]  the great abolitionists from the top abolitionists
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:20.760]  in the country against slavery.
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:22.680]  That's why they say that he should be taken down
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.040]  because it's for slavery that Betsy Ross was a slaver.
[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:26.560]  The left hates her.
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:28.480]  They hate Martin Luther King
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:30.120]  because they were Republicans.
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:34.560]  And later, the party that developed other Republicans
[1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:35.920]  came out of George Washington.
[1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:37.840]  But as you can see right here,
[1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:39.280]  Thomas Jefferson found the Democrats.
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:42.200]  He was a pretty good guy, but you see this photo,
[1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:45.080]  this is beautiful, and they achieved
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:48.640]  what their main mission was.
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:51.520]  And Joe Biggs talked about that.
[1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:55.320]  The interview's up on infowars.com when he was fresh
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:01.320]  away from the area there in Portland, Oregon,
[1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:03.200]  at a nearby park.
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:05.280]  And he joined us and he joins us now
[1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:06.120]  for the balance of the hour.
[1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:07.280]  Look at these headlines.
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:10.600]  Anti-Becauses Disturbances,
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:14.600]  Long After Most Proud Boys Leave Portland Rally.
[1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:17.320]  And the Washington Examiner gets it right,
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:21.600]  but even AP reported that Antifa basically tore
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:24.000]  the town up after they left.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.520]  Antifa attacks little girl and her father.
[1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:31.080]  But Joe, you're saying you got what you wanted.
[1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:34.160]  So again, Joe Biggs, the former infowars.com reporter.
[1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:35.680]  I'm very proud he went off to his own thing.
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:37.680]  I encouraged him to do it.
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:39.640]  And he's got his own vision, which I agreed with.
[1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:40.920]  And now he's had a huge success.
[1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:42.440]  And I appreciate everybody holding
[1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:44.480]  while I covered that last segment.
[1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:46.720]  But I would call this a big success.
[1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:48.440]  You guys went in, you planted the flag,
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:50.000]  you had your stuff together.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.040]  Antifa went crazy, illustrating they are a terrorist group.
[1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:55.640]  So Joe and crew, thanks for joining us.
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:56.480]  Thank you very much.
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:22:58.160]  We appreciate it, Alec.
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:00.200]  So you guys have the floor for the next three segments.
[1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:01.880]  Got a great crew there with you.
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:04.200]  I mean, tell us the takeaway from this.
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:06.760]  The iconography, you're the Americans
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:09.080]  that are pro-free speech against these terrorists
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:11.400]  that are anti-free speech.
[1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:12.080]  Well, it's hilarious.
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:15.000]  A lot of these headlines on videos and articles
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.440]  say proud boys clashed with Antifa.
[1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:19.280]  There was no clashing at all.
[1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:21.080]  We never clashed with them at all.
[1:23:21.080 --> 1:23:24.800]  We met peacefully under a bridge right beside a fire station.
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:26.640]  And everyone showed up on buses.
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:28.400]  Then we marched, like we said, we
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:31.280]  were going to do out to the Waterfront Park.
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:36.280]  We did the Iwo Jima style flag post into the ground,
[1:23:36.280 --> 1:23:39.880]  set a prayer, Enrique and I spoke a little bit.
[1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:42.240]  And then we went back over to Vancouver, Washington,
[1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:44.040]  and partied until like four in the morning.
[1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:45.440]  I mean, we had a blast.
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:48.840]  And this is a big troll on the left in Ted Wheeler.
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:51.320]  They've been promoting this idea that we're
[1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:54.600]  going to come in with bats and guns and kill people
[1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:58.120]  to a point where I even get sued by the leader of Antifa
[1:23:58.120 --> 1:24:00.280]  in Portland, Oregon yesterday, saying
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:01.640]  that he fears for his life that I'm
[1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:04.520]  going to come over there and kill him yesterday.
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:07.680]  So they just built up this entire hateful, fearful
[1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:08.600]  environment.
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:10.560]  And we just kind of went in there like cool, calm,
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:13.240]  collected adults, did our thing, and walked off
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:14.560]  and had one elevate time.
[1:24:14.560 --> 1:24:16.520]  As we sat back and watched the news,
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:20.280]  we watched Antifa attack their own city, their own people.
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:23.320]  And it's proved the entire point of why we went there
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:26.480]  is that they have a huge criminal element in Portland.
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:28.880]  And Ted Wheeler's not willing to do anything about it.
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:32.120]  And these guys are running amok, destroying their own city,
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:34.280]  beating up little girls.
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:35.360]  It's disgusting.
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:37.680]  Beating up journalists, beating up old men.
[1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:39.440]  And again, for TV viewers and regulars,
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:41.200]  introduce some of these other folks in the room.
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:43.680]  And we'll start getting their take on things as well, Joe.
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:47.520]  All right, so we got Ruthio Piamman right here, the man.
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.880]  Enrique Tario, Brad Chadford in the back.
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:55.520]  These are another USA.
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:57.000]  Yeah, she wanted to introduce herself,
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.320]  so I'm going to let her do it.
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:00.240]  You got Joseph Oakman.
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:01.080]  God.
[1:25:01.080 --> 1:25:02.080]  And Zach Scott.
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:03.680]  A lot of these guys here helped us
[1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:05.560]  organize this.
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:08.920]  I want to get all their takes on this when we come back.
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:11.280]  But I mean, Joe, this was really dangerous,
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:12.800]  because these are terrorists you're up against.
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:15.040]  You had the FBI tell you, visit your family,
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:16.520]  and you tell you not to go.
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:17.880]  And you weren't trying to stir up trouble.
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:18.480]  You never were.
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:21.400]  They're saying conservatives can't be on the streets of America,
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:23.040]  don't let any Trump supporter rest,
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:25.280]  harass the members of Congress are pushing this.
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:26.720]  You had to do this.
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:28.960]  It's like the sheriff in a corrupt town in the old days
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:31.560]  saying, we don't allow outsiders here.
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:33.280]  Or like black folks going in and sitting
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:35.400]  at the lunch counter or at the front of the bus.
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:36.320]  You did the same thing.
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.920]  You had people telling you, as Americans, as veterans,
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:40.600]  you're not welcome to march here.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:43.840]  So you had to do this, and you did it successfully
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:45.360]  with your, you know what, together.
[1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:47.600]  And then they acted like monsters, which is exactly
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:49.680]  what you planned to illustrate.
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:50.320]  Yes, exactly.
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:53.240]  The whole point was to bait them out of the shadows,
[1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:55.680]  have them out there in the light where the world could see.
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:56.360]  And they did it.
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:57.240]  Hookline and sinker.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:59.920]  We carried them, baited them out there, and they did it.
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:01.160]  And none of us got hurt.
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:02.480]  None of us got arrested.
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:04.520]  We had one hell of a time in Portland yesterday.
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:05.240]  It was good.
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:07.560]  I got to tell you, yeah, none of your main group.
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:09.400]  But when a few folks tried to go home,
[1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:11.680]  that's when they caught them in parking lots and things.
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:13.960]  I mean, obviously, you've seen the shocking video of them
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:16.360]  beating up old men, taking their American flags away,
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:17.840]  attacking what looks like little girls.
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:20.160]  I mean, this is shocking footage.
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:22.080]  Throwing hammers at people.
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:22.840]  That's another one.
[1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:23.640]  That was huge.
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:25.920]  Yeah, one of the buses, they were the last ones out
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:28.480]  because I got a call from our liaison officer.
[1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:30.600]  When that yellow school bus and that black bus
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:33.920]  pulled out of there, Antifa started throwing hammers at it.
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:36.840]  They ripped open the door, started sparing bear spray
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:37.800]  in there.
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:40.160]  And at one point, they were shattering the glass.
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:42.720]  One of the girls that was riding in it, I interviewed her.
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:45.800]  She was covered in blood because they were throwing glass,
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:47.960]  beating stuff, hammers through the windows.
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:50.040]  And they got to a point where they couldn't see
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:51.480]  because of the spray in there.
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:53.400]  And one guy said he had to just start
[1:26:53.400 --> 1:26:56.240]  punching blindly just to keep people out of there
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:26:58.520]  because they were trying to get on the bus and rip people
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.960]  off in the street where they can then just beat them.
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.600]  We just showed the footage of them chasing him.
[1:27:02.600 --> 1:27:04.840]  Yeah, there's the footage of them trying to pour in.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.600]  And the guys fighting like three of them off,
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:09.040]  it's just totally un-American.
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:10.840]  It's dangerous.
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:11.360]  Yeah, it is.
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:13.640]  But I mean, look, this is what we wanted the world to see.
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:16.080]  And the world got to see it on every channel
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:18.480]  and every article, on every YouTube thing.
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:21.360]  We expose Antifa for what they are.
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:25.560]  We put an entire global spotlight on this problem.
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.440]  And now it's up to President Donald Trump, man,
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:29.280]  to get this job done, label them.
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:31.480]  A domestic terrorist organization.
[1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:34.640]  Let's get these anti-masking laws put in place
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:35.760]  throughout the country.
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:38.000]  And this is going to tear a lot of stuff from happening.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:38.920]  We get this done.
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:40.280]  Antifa will be a thing in the past.
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:42.160]  She won't see any more.
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:43.680]  Well, we've got a bunch of these clips
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:44.960]  we're going to play next segment.
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:46.920]  And the mic's OK as long as you're up close.
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:48.200]  So as we talk to each person, Joe,
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:50.040]  they're going to probably get what you're at.
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:52.160]  Or if you have an external mic, let's
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:53.520]  try to plug that baby in because I'm
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:55.880]  going to talk to each and every one of these great people
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:58.560]  that I see there in the background with a wall-set Rufio on.
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:27:59.160]  He's awesome.
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:27:59.960]  Everybody's awesome.
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:02.560]  We'll play some of the clips of you guys in the past being
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:03.640]  attacked like Rufio.
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:05.400]  And then he knocks a couple of them out.
[1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:06.640]  And the media says that's wrong.
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:09.960]  They're trying to hit Rufio with an extendable metal baton
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:11.480]  that you can kill people with.
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:13.720]  He dodges it, knocks the guy out,
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:15.600]  and then he's the bad guy.
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:16.840]  Yeah, there's one of the shots.
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:19.600]  But there's the one where they try to attack him with a baton.
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:22.080]  And again, the American flag flapping in the background,
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:24.960]  Hollywood could not come up with footage
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:26.680]  that is dramatic as this.
[1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:29.000]  So we'll cover it all with Joe Biggs, who said, look,
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:30.720]  I'm sick of watching him attack all these people.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.000]  I'm going to go there a month ago.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.480]  He went there yesterday.
[1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:36.400]  Close to 500, 600 people showed up.
[1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:38.080]  They marched in, planted the American flag,
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:41.480]  and it is really exposed just how terrorist Antifa is
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:43.000]  and how they're anti-American.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:44.760]  And the shooter in Ohio was Antifa.
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:45.480]  Evidence is bounding.
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:47.360]  The shooter in Texas was Antifa.
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:49.880]  The big next threat is them staging false flags.
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:51.760]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com.
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:56.920]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:00.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:02.480]  This isn't a law and order TV program.
[1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:03.960]  This is reality.
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:05.880]  And I'll say this, it's all of our birthright.
[1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:08.000]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:10.120]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:11.520]  We're seeing election meddling.
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:13.360]  And it's time to admit it and to realize
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:15.520]  we've seen a giant backdoor power grab.
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:16.960]  They didn't come like an enemy.
[1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:19.320]  From over the horizon, they came from inside.
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:21.920]  And they came through cyberspace, our republic,
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:24.800]  our constitutional little d-democracy has been hacked.
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:26.720]  And please remember, without your financial support,
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:28.920]  we wouldn't have stood this withering storm
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:30.960]  of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:33.480]  We have the new World Awakens mega sale,
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:35.120]  Globalist House of Cards collapsing
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:36.360]  end of summer super sale.
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:38.760]  It's the big giant 50% to 60% off,
[1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:40.720]  store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points,
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:44.160]  but only on 50-something items, not on every item,
[1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:46.080]  because a bunch of these are very close to selling out.
[1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:48.080]  Whether it's ultimate krill oil, bodies, turmeric,
[1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:49.960]  Rainforest Plus, knockout sleeping,
[1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:52.000]  herbophores, eight-pack power stack,
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:53.600]  it's all 50% to 60% off,
[1:29:53.600 --> 1:29:56.240]  and your purchases make it all possible here.
[1:29:58.080 --> 1:29:59.520]  I talk about this on the air,
[1:29:59.520 --> 1:30:00.920]  and I know it stinks into people,
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:02.600]  but I've decided that we're gonna kind of
[1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:03.920]  reboot all our supplements,
[1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:05.720]  in that if you go back five, six years ago,
[1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:07.200]  before all the censorship and attacks
[1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:08.640]  and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:10.520]  I would talk about how great the products are
[1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:12.200]  and how they were the best and why they were,
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:13.520]  and I'd have doctors on an expert's
[1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:14.800]  to explain why they were so good.
[1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:16.080]  And instead, the last few years,
[1:30:16.080 --> 1:30:18.000]  I'm like, hey, we need to really support us.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:18.920]  Or they'll shut us down.
[1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:20.600]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements,
[1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:21.440]  because they know how great they are
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:22.600]  and how wonderful they were.
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:24.320]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:27.200]  Joan sells unapproved supplements,
[1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:28.560]  and he claims they're supplements.
[1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:31.160]  No, under federal law since 1996,
[1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:34.520]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.560]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:37.840]  But then they say you've gotta say
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:39.200]  it's not approved by them,
[1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:40.880]  and all drugs are is the system
[1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:42.360]  trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature
[1:30:42.360 --> 1:30:44.160]  and manipulate it and do different things.
[1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:45.320]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[1:30:45.320 --> 1:30:47.200]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature,
[1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:49.120]  but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing
[1:30:49.120 --> 1:30:50.840]  about God's medicine chest.
[1:30:50.840 --> 1:30:54.800]  Infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three,
[1:30:54.800 --> 1:30:56.320]  three, one, three, nine.
[1:30:57.240 --> 1:31:01.680]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:03.920]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:06.280]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground,
[1:31:06.280 --> 1:31:08.920]  close to reality, who actually worked for a living
[1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:10.400]  that would end up saving the nation.
[1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:11.960]  And today, the Communist Chinese
[1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:15.040]  have banned all US farming goods a week ago.
[1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:17.800]  And we've seen massive increases in polls
[1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:19.440]  to support for the president
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:21.120]  and what he's doing in this trade war
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:24.000]  once China put pressure on our farmers.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:24.960]  That's beautiful.
[1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:26.920]  Americans aren't gonna be bullied
[1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:28.440]  and we aren't gonna back down.
[1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:31.640]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's
[1:31:31.640 --> 1:31:33.240]  the world that wanna intimidate people
[1:31:33.240 --> 1:31:36.120]  and tell us to back down, we're never gonna give up.
[1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:38.520]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[1:31:38.520 --> 1:31:41.320]  The human spirit lives at infowarstore.com
[1:31:41.320 --> 1:31:42.640]  and newswarstore.com.
[1:31:42.640 --> 1:31:44.360]  And I'm asking listeners,
[1:31:44.360 --> 1:31:45.760]  whatever you do, spread those links
[1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:48.440]  because we are the light and the dark of the night.
[1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:49.520]  We are the resistance.
[1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:52.040]  We are 1776, worldwide.
[1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:01.360]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development
[1:32:01.360 --> 1:32:05.720]  in free speech in the Western world's history.
[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:09.960]  This is a digital AI enforced gag order.
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:14.360]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or infowars.com.
[1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:21.080]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:22.280]  This is racketeering.
[1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:23.400]  This is cartels.
[1:32:23.400 --> 1:32:25.840]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:27.680]  We need it now.
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:29.400]  You can take on big tech.
[1:32:29.400 --> 1:32:32.640]  They saw info wars as a dominant, independent,
[1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:36.800]  anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:38.320]  populist organization.
[1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:41.320]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones.
[1:32:41.320 --> 1:32:44.440]  Then when people say, okay, take him off the air,
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:46.360]  everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:49.400]  The way to fight back is to support info wars now
[1:32:49.400 --> 1:32:51.920]  more than ever and make it a standard of freedom
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:52.760]  and free speech.
[1:32:52.760 --> 1:32:55.200]  Understand that they believe they can take us down.
[1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:56.800]  They'll take everybody else down.
[1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:07.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:07.800 --> 1:33:19.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:22.080]  broadcasting worldwide.
[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:24.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.200 --> 1:33:27.800]  So despite all the threats, they were gonna have guns,
[1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:28.920]  they were gonna have ball bearings,
[1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:29.760]  they were gonna kill them.
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:31.680]  They've already thrown concrete at people.
[1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:34.560]  Steel clubs, the police protect Antifa.
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:38.000]  But 500 plus patriots are more ended up showing up.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:39.800]  National news, the president tweeting.
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:40.960]  The police had to do their job,
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:44.040]  which they've been asking the mayor to do.
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:48.360]  And Antifa then rioted once, the proud boys
[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:50.480]  and the patriots left, true cowards.
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:53.560]  But if you wanna know who the left fears most,
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:55.360]  it's red blooded Americans.
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:56.680]  You may have different skin color,
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:58.720]  but love liberty and are proud of this country.
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:01.040]  And there's nothing wrong with being proud of this nation.
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:02.440]  They're trying to demoralize us
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:03.360]  and make us hate ourselves.
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:04.600]  It's not, none of work.
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:07.840]  But now with the internal New York Times documents
[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:08.800]  coming out two days ago,
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:10.440]  that they plan to cause a race war.
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:12.680]  We already knew this, but it's all there.
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:15.720]  74 minutes, the whole transcript saying,
[1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:18.120]  Russiagate didn't work, let's go with race war.
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:20.360]  And so now we're looking at a snapshot
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:22.280]  of how to counter these people,
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:24.640]  how to not let them control the narrative.
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:27.640]  No one is more protected than Antifa by media
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:30.200]  and by stay-behind grips and embedded grips
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:31.040]  in the government.
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:33.120]  So the White House is watching right now, obviously.
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:34.360]  Joe Biggs, this segment and the next,
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:38.240]  I wanna give you the floor to Traffic Cop,
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:40.440]  some of these great folks that are,
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:42.640]  we're there, these great Americans.
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:46.080]  So start introducing us to some of these people.
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:47.760]  All right, so I got Willie right here,
[1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:49.560]  Rufio Panman, you guys all know him
[1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:51.800]  from a lot of these videos out in the streets
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:54.960]  where he's been protesting in Portland against Antifa.
[1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:56.720]  You know, what was your thoughts of yesterday?
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:59.560]  You know, like what happened and all that?
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:01.560]  Well, overall, I thought it was really encouraging
[1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:04.960]  to see everybody come out regardless of all the threats
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:06.520]  and all the scare tactics,
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:08.640]  fear tactics there, but not there.
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:10.520]  You could tell the mayor was really trying hard
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:14.000]  when he put out all those arrests for prior rallies
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.200]  that had happened there to try and scare off everybody.
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:17.320]  And it worked to some extent,
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:19.600]  but we had a lot of good-hearted,
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:22.080]  good-spirited Americans come out yesterday that,
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:23.440]  you know, we all had a good time
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:25.360]  and Antifa showed their two colors
[1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:26.960]  and that's all I could ask for.
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:31.280]  Yeah, I mean, it was really interesting too
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:35.000]  to see Mayor Ted Wheeler come out yesterday evening too
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:36.320]  and just frightened.
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:39.360]  I mean, like, he's like, this cost us $2 million
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:40.680]  and we didn't get any blood shed.
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:44.280]  Like it seemed like Ted Wheeler wanted there to be blood
[1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:46.720]  and he wanted us to be the ones that were arrested
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.080]  when all it was was Antifa showing their actual true colors.
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:52.200]  They're the ones that got arrested.
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:53.040]  They're the ones that killed people.
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:54.200]  And you wouldn't have had to be there
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:55.280]  if they didn't tell the world
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:57.080]  there's no free speech in Portland.
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:35:58.920]  Yeah, Ted Wheeler says,
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:01.160]  I don't want Joe Biggs back in Portland ever.
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:03.200]  Well, guess what?
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:05.400]  If you don't do your job, I'm coming back again,
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:06.760]  and again, and again,
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:08.760]  and we'll continue to do it, Ted Wheeler,
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:10.320]  until you aren't elected again
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:13.080]  or until you actually do something about Antifa.
[1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:16.720]  Even the reporter, Mr. No, caught dozens of assaults
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:17.600]  once you guys left.
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:19.360]  They would follow people back to their cars.
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:20.720]  But what about what we don't see?
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:23.600]  We always know that we only see like 1% on camera
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:24.560]  of what really happened.
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:27.680]  What else went on, Rufio and Joe Biggs, that we didn't see?
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:32.680]  Well, shoot.
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:34.000]  I mean, one of the iconic things,
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.800]  I guess, would be that bridge.
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:38.040]  That bridge always gets closed down for these events.
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:40.920]  He said that's the first time they've ever opened up
[1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:44.760]  that lane and allowed someone to cross over it on foot.
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:47.120]  They said that was a pretty big moment.
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:49.560]  Even the police and a lot of the other professional
[1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:51.840]  photographers that cover these events in Portland,
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:53.920]  they said it's never been done before.
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:55.800]  And I guarantee you that's because
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:57.880]  we cooperated with the police.
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:36:59.480]  We kind of scared them a bit,
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:01.440]  throwing them a really weird route
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:03.200]  that Enrique came up with.
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:06.240]  They thought that we were gonna have all these crazy routes
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:08.480]  going through these Antifa parks.
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:09.960]  But we didn't, we came out there
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:12.000]  and let them know that we were just screwing around
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:12.840]  with them.
[1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:14.720]  What do you make of these cowards as soon as you left
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:16.520]  following a few people to their cars,
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:18.120]  watching them attack that little girl
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:20.320]  and they tase her, but it doesn't go in?
[1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:23.280]  I mean, those guys need to be charged with attempted murder.
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:24.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:37:24.200 --> 1:37:26.280]  I mean, these guys came out with tons of weapons.
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:28.520]  The police came to our side and made sure
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:31.840]  that we only had flag poles made with PVC pipe.
[1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:34.440]  So I'm curious as to what happened on that side.
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:36.520]  Did police not go through there and disarm them?
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:37.960]  Well, obviously not.
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:39.440]  We're the ones that are compliant.
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:41.160]  We're the ones that have to be disarmed.
[1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:44.600]  Yet these guys run around like rabid animals
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:46.720]  and they're allowed to bring in hammers,
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:49.640]  bear mace and all this stuff and really hurt people.
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:54.160]  Well, you guys have incredible restraint.
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:56.160]  I mean, I go back to Rufia where they're trying to get him
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:59.640]  with metal batons and stuff and then he's the bad guy.
[1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:01.640]  Whatever ended up happening to Joey Gibson,
[1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:04.280]  I know he got arrested for no reason.
[1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:09.200]  He was released, he was actually at the rally with us
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:12.320]  having a good time as well with his crew.
[1:38:12.320 --> 1:38:14.760]  Like I said, we're used to dealing
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:16.080]  with a lot of these extremists
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:19.000]  and because we had a good group of people
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.320]  and the cops actually were trying to do their job
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:24.400]  at least on our side during our rally.
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:26.040]  We didn't have to deal with any of that.
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:28.440]  We got to enjoy ourselves and really just focus
[1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:29.280]  on the metal baton.
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:31.080]  I gotta say, you guys pulled off 100%,
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:32.400]  but I think all glory goes to God.
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:35.800]  I know you guys prayed, right, Joe, before the event?
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:38.480]  Before and right, once we got into the field
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:41.560]  before we planted the flag, we had another prayer.
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.160]  And everyone took a knee.
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:45.720]  We got down there and really thanked God
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:48.840]  for this opportunity, for this worldwide stage.
[1:38:48.840 --> 1:38:51.000]  And it was truly a blessing.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:54.720]  I've been nervous for days just with the weight of all this.
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:56.960]  You hear all this stuff, mass arrests,
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:38:58.240]  everyone's saying, don't come here,
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:00.320]  we're gonna kill you, blah, blah, blah.
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:02.520]  And as the organizer, that's a lot on me
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:03.880]  because if someone gets hurt,
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:05.240]  that's something I'm gonna have to live with
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:06.480]  for the rest of my life.
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:08.240]  And I was just like, please God,
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:10.480]  let us go in here, let us do what we gotta do,
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:13.400]  let's get out, no one gets hurt, no one gets in trouble,
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:15.360]  and let's send a message and we did it.
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:17.480]  And I mean, I couldn't ask for a better event,
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:20.720]  a better group of patriots beside me, behind me,
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:21.560]  helping me out.
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:23.640]  I mean, this has just been an amazing time.
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:24.480]  It's beautiful.
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.720]  Okay, let's bring Henrique in here.
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:30.280]  I'm not supposed to say Henrique,
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:32.360]  I can barely speak even Texan,
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:35.160]  but I've had this guy on the show before, he's awesome.
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:37.640]  On Rikev, I'm saying it now, right?
[1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:39.360]  Am I saying it right or are you gonna punch me in the face?
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:41.080]  Henrique, Henrique, Henrique.
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:41.920]  I did say it right.
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:43.720]  See you guys are telling me to say it different.
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:46.040]  You're awesome being here with us,
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:47.840]  give us your take on what you saw.
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:53.960]  I think one of the biggest reasons for our success
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:57.880]  coming into Saturday is we went with an approach
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:00.400]  of the Saturdays for the boys.
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:05.240]  We went with smiles on our faces and loving our hearts.
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:08.040]  And we couldn't, I couldn't have done this,
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:09.160]  all of us couldn't have done this
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:11.960]  without the six organizers that put this together.
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:15.520]  Joe, Oak, Rufio, Mateo,
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:17.560]  and a big shout out to Jacob Engels.
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:19.560]  He couldn't be with us this weekend
[1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:20.920]  because he was working with Mr. Stone,
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:23.960]  but he helped us big time on the media front.
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:26.440]  We've been planning this for two months,
[1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:29.040]  getting it together, planning every single detail,
[1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:31.240]  every single deviation.
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:34.520]  It's been very fluid, fluid with the law enforcement
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:35.800]  and all that with law enforcement.
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:37.600]  Ken Ray Kay, what was it like though?
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:40.200]  You see these iconic photographs and things,
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:42.080]  but you really see a spirit of brotherhood
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:45.600]  and humanity there and how loving and open and strong
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:47.000]  you guys are, I'm sorry.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.840]  You look at Antifa, they look like somebody threw a bunch
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:52.640]  of, you know, what up against the wall.
[1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:55.440]  Yeah, and that's the biggest reason
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:40:57.680]  why our brotherhood is so successful.
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:40:59.440]  We're really tight knit.
[1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:02.040]  We work together, we talk to each other every day.
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:05.520]  And going back to that, the planning phase was so amazing
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:07.080]  because we have such a good relationship,
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:08.840]  such a tightly wound relationship.
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:12.200]  And we think of our guys first.
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:14.200]  I mean, we do events like every other day.
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.920]  We're almost at this point like brothers and sisters.
[1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:18.960]  I mean, we're a family.
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:21.080]  We've, in the past 60 days,
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:23.920]  I've been home probably about five days in a row.
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:26.760]  And we just continue to do this
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:28.520]  and we planned this very well.
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:31.920]  We were in communication with the Portland PD.
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:35.200]  That relationship was great up until like two days
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:37.440]  before the event, that relationship went sour,
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:38.760]  not because of the Portland PD,
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:40.240]  because it was an amazing job.
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:44.240]  But what we saw was a difference in communication
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:49.480]  between what the PD was telling us
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:51.480]  and what Ted Weider was putting out.
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:55.680]  And we caught wind of an attempt on like mass arrests
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:41:57.520]  on our side, so we couldn't put a risk
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:41:59.520]  on our guys.
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:01.040]  So we went in there.
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:03.400]  We took a knee as soon as we got in.
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:04.600]  We were in prayer.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:05.920]  We prayed for Antifa.
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:07.120]  We prayed for Portland PD.
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:09.320]  We prayed for our guys.
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:13.480]  We planted our flag and we were gone.
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:14.440]  That's it.
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:17.200]  It was just the exercise of you don't own this.
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:18.400]  This belongs to the American people.
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:20.280]  This is America and you're not gonna do this.
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:22.200]  Beautiful Henry K.
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:24.520]  And again, folks, this has to be a special thing
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:26.200]  to march into a leftist city today.
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:29.160]  Believe me, if you're not publicly known, you're lucky.
[1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:31.640]  When you're a Trump supporter and they know who you are,
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.920]  they spit in your food, they attack you,
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:35.720]  they come after your children,
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:38.160]  and they're just such horrible people.
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:40.760]  But we have to go challenge them
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:43.160]  to draw them out to expose them to the world.
[1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:44.360]  They're not the good guys, folks.
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:45.640]  They're the bad guys.
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:48.520]  They work for the globalists, the chai comms and others.
[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:49.920]  Their time is here.
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:52.240]  They're being brought down right now.
[1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:57.240]  Stay with us.
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:24.960]  The equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century,
[1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:27.280]  who ran American politics and ran American economy,
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:29.680]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:30.640]  after the Great Depression.
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:33.080]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:35.600]  the light of liberty across the world,
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:38.280]  to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:40.080]  to make real the original promise
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:41.240]  of an independent free press.
[1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:43.400]  Real collusion is big tech and big media,
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:45.200]  manipulating and working with each other
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:46.800]  to try to meddle with elections,
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:48.080]  to try to shake people's thoughts.
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:50.240]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time
[1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:51.080]  it's not happening.
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:52.720]  The ultimate form of gaslighting.
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:54.600]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:56.200]  Even it is what we just saw.
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:43:59.600]  An info warrior fan favorite formula,
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:02.280]  Survival Shield X2, continues to lead the way
[1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:04.720]  into the next generation of super high quality
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:06.640]  nascent iodine formulas.
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:10.280]  Derived from ancient sea salts found more than 7,000 feet
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:11.840]  below the Earth's surface,
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:16.720]  every drop of Survival Shield X2 contains 650 micrograms
[1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:18.480]  to keep you in your prime form.
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:22.240]  Even today, iodine deficiency remains a serious problem,
[1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:24.560]  with the World Health Organization estimating
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:27.360]  that nearly 50 million people still suffer
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:29.040]  from some kind of mental impairment
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:31.200]  related to iodine deficiency.
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:32.520]  That's why it's so important
[1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:34.840]  that you try Survival Shield X2.
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:39.040]  The only source of 99.999% ultra pure,

[1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.040]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:44:59.400]  Marcus here on the air, thanks for holding.
[1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:01.240]  Hey Alex, yeah, I just wanted to say,
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:02.720]  your show is a breath of fresh air.
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:05.000]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.640]  and one thing I could tell you is that
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:08.840]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:11.080]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately
[1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:13.360]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.840]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:18.320]  in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:19.160]  That's it.
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:20.280]  I mean, if Trump buys into this,
[1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:21.560]  it'll be the end of his presidency.
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:23.080]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated
[1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:24.280]  other than assassinating him.
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:25.720]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:26.560]  I agree entirely.
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:28.120]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:29.800]  is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:31.880]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:34.840]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:36.280]  I would love to see what you're talking about
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:38.360]  when you're 80, but if they do shut you down,
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:40.120]  no, you've gone into this war.
[1:45:40.120 --> 1:45:42.040]  You've won a lot of battles
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:44.200]  and there are a lot of people like myself
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:46.080]  and many others who are going to continue.
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:47.880]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:50.400]  And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:53.280]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:54.440]  fired up for liberty.
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:55.840]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.480]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:01.640]  And I couldn't thank you all enough
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:03.080]  for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:04.480]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:05.840]  I want to take the globalist on.
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:07.800]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:09.800]  If I bring in $35 million,
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.520]  half of that's the cost of the products
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:12.960]  because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:14.520]  I don't care if I'm not making money,
[1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:15.960]  but you need to buy the products.
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:17.560]  We got coffee, we got fish oil,
[1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:19.320]  we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste.
[1:46:19.320 --> 1:46:21.720]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus,
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:24.400]  but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months.
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:25.240]  For whatever reason,
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:26.960]  this became the most popular fish oil.
[1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:28.440]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:30.840]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:32.920]  and it cost us three times more
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:34.280]  because we have it put through
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:37.520]  the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:38.920]  Any type of krill oil you get
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:40.560]  that doesn't give you fish burps,
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:41.400]  which I don't like,
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:42.800]  but gives you all the great benefits,
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:43.640]  is it real?
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:44.880]  It's been boiled, it's been rillined,
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:45.720]  it's been homogenized.
[1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:46.640]  This has not been.
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:48.120]  This, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:51.080]  is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:52.880]  Real krill oil folks is red.
[1:46:52.880 --> 1:46:54.400]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:56.200]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:03.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:03.360 --> 1:47:07.560]  LATWS
[1:47:07.560 --> 1:47:19.760]  Waging War on Corruption.
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:22.800]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:25.400]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:32.400]  I was born in the soul of this.
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:35.120]  We really are here in defiance of the globalist.
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  I remember when I got totally banned off the internet
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:40.520]  like a year ago, I felt so good seeing Joe Biggs going viral.
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:43.280]  I just said the bigger he gets,
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:45.480]  the more they're going to fry him.
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:49.200]  And I'm not bragging, Matt Dredge came here four years ago
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:50.760]  and said, you better build your own stuff,
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:53.520]  your own infrastructure, you're going to be taken off.
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:56.680]  And I remember calling Joe going,
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:57.800]  you got to get your own website,
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:47:58.800]  you got to get your own thing.
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:01.160]  And he was like, man, I'm really busy doing all these rallies
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:03.360]  and stuff, but they got him.
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:05.080]  And I'm not see, I told you so.
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:09.400]  But it's scary now that one of the few places Joe Biggs,
[1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:10.920]  these great people can be heard
[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:13.680]  so they can't be lied about is here on the show.
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:15.440]  That's why M4 is so special.
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:19.760]  And I've done an hour and 50 minutes of broadcast
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:21.160]  and I haven't plugged one time.
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:22.080]  I'm just going to leave it at this.
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:24.880]  We got a big super sale end of summer,
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:27.400]  super sale running right now, one of the biggest ever.
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:29.800]  It's got to end very soon, m4store.com.
[1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:32.120]  Take advantage of if you want to support the broadcast,
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:33.360]  but I just want to thank everybody.
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:35.520]  So world awakens mega sale
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:38.040]  as the house of globalist cards collapses.
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:40.120]  I going back to Joe Biggs and a few of these other folks
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:43.840]  who want to get in here, Joe, this really is big
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:46.840]  because they were going to try to make it violent.
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:48.040]  They were going to try to derail it.
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:51.120]  They were going to demonize you no matter what you did.
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:54.240]  And if out of all the possible outcomes,
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:55.920]  when even the Associated Press admitted
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:58.600]  it was pretty much nonviolent except for the left
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:01.600]  and then Antifa tore the city up after you went.
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:03.960]  I don't see how you got an outcome this good.
[1:49:03.960 --> 1:49:05.080]  I said, go ahead with it
[1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:07.160]  because it's the right thing to do.
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:09.280]  And I'm glad you did and your folks are great,
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:11.520]  but you got to be thanking your lucky stars.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:14.320]  But I think it's when you put God on the deed
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:16.200]  and you didn't do it out of an arrogant thing.
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:18.040]  You're like, hey, God, please help us.
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:19.320]  God doesn't want to be a loser.
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:20.760]  And I think it's those prayers
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:22.840]  and the viewers and listeners prayers
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:24.520]  that took us across.
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:26.520]  But let me tell you, this was a dangerous maneuver.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.120]  It was the right maneuver.
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:30.840]  And it's just a very beautiful thing that happened.
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:34.240]  Yeah, I mean, look at that shot behind you.
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:36.720]  That's one of the most iconic photos ever.
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:38.280]  That's just going to be amazing right there.
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:42.240]  I mean, that just encompasses everything that we did.
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:44.160]  I mean, that looks like total victory right there.
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:45.440]  And that's what it was.
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:48.000]  We left out of there with our heads held high,
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:49.560]  brothers and sisters.
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:52.120]  And we went back to God and then you had
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:53.920]  the American Flag Day for so much.
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:55.480]  That's not as powerful as God,
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:49:57.320]  but it's been God inspired.
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:59.040]  It's another powerful symbol.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:00.840]  Yes.
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:02.960]  And he should frame it and put it in his office.
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:03.800]  He frames.
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:05.600]  Yeah, you guys got to get that frame.
[1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:08.200]  I'll give a donation to whoever has that flag.
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:10.400]  I want to frame that sucker.
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:12.880]  Because it takes on real energy.
[1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:14.880]  So tell me who this, I'm going to be perfectly correct.
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:17.160]  Who is this beautiful young lady here?
[1:50:17.160 --> 1:50:19.400]  This is my little sister right here at Adriana.
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:20.920]  That's your little sister.
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:21.760]  Wow.
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:27.120]  Yeah, so she runs demandfreespeech.org
[1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:29.560]  and she actually does a lot of the events
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:31.320]  that I go to and speak at as well.
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:33.320]  She did the one back in DC
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:35.720]  and then we have another one coming up in Miami, right?
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:36.560]  Yeah.
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:37.400]  Yeah.
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:38.240]  September 28th.
[1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:40.800]  So, you know, tell us about what you thought yesterday.
[1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:42.480]  All right, you know, yesterday, honestly,
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:45.320]  I felt was a big victory for our side.
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:47.480]  You know, being a woman, a small woman coming in,
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:50.280]  working with these men who defend our country
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:52.760]  who are considered terrorists in our country
[1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:54.000]  because that's what the left wants.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.280]  That's what these people want.
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:56.680]  They want these men.
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:50:58.840]  These men who work for our living,
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:01.880]  who support their family, who do right thing as chauvinists,
[1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:03.200]  respect their constitution.
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:05.040]  They are the terrorists of our country.
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:09.520]  So what we did yesterday was honestly a pillar point,
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:11.040]  you know, for everybody to look at.
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:13.760]  The media, everybody that was involved yesterday,
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:18.760]  they were able to see that Antifa chased this march.
[1:51:19.160 --> 1:51:20.280]  They came to us.
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:23.600]  We peacefully turned around, turned the cold cheek,
[1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:25.840]  walked away and they came towards us
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:28.600]  and they started domestically abusing their city
[1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:31.160]  and abusing people that they shouldn't be touching.
[1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:32.920]  You know, that 10-year-old daughter,
[1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:35.240]  she was maced, she was tasered.
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:36.320]  I mean, come on now.
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:38.360]  It's sad that a lot of people have to go in there
[1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:39.880]  and provoke things, yes.
[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:42.440]  But what we see out there is domestic terrorism
[1:51:42.440 --> 1:51:43.360]  and this needs to stop.
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:44.960]  And that's why we do events like this.
[1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:47.160]  We go, we want to be loud.
[1:51:47.160 --> 1:51:49.960]  We need to make things press, rudely heard.
[1:51:49.960 --> 1:51:52.920]  And if we don't, nothing's going to get changed.
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:54.560]  So that's what we're out here doing, you know,
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:56.280]  demandfreeswitch.org.
[1:51:56.280 --> 1:51:57.480]  You know, we're going to be in Miami,
[1:51:57.480 --> 1:51:59.080]  Laura Loomer running for Congress.
[1:51:59.080 --> 1:52:02.520]  We need to grasp, rudely, get our people into Congress
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:04.480]  to get these laws moving.
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:05.320]  You know, Antifa-
[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:07.440]  No, I totally agree, but let me just raise this.
[1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:09.080]  And I'm not trying to be cosmetic here,
[1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:10.920]  but like Trump goes off looks
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:13.000]  and you can be a little old man or whatever,
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:14.960]  it's the energy that you project.
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:17.360]  You look at Antifa, they look like vampire,
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:21.800]  methademons and then you see all the patriots.
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:23.240]  I mean, this is the, I mean,
[1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:25.720]  it's like Trump always says, central casting, God,
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:27.520]  look how good looking these people are.
[1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:29.080]  When he, you know, because, because the,
[1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:30.320]  I mean, it's statistically true,
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:32.400]  conservatives and nationals and patriots,
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:33.920]  they could be black, they could be Hispanic,
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:35.960]  they could be white, they could be anybody.
[1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:37.400]  I'm not saying I'm Mr. Movie Star,
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:38.760]  but compared to the leftist I am,
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:40.360]  why are they so ugly?
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:41.920]  I mean, what's wrong with them?
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:45.880]  Look at these beautiful faces in here.
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:48.720]  You know, seriously, Alex, honestly, you're not wrong.
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:51.080]  They really do have a different complexion towards them.
[1:52:51.080 --> 1:52:53.480]  I think it is because they're demeanor
[1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:54.880]  and how they live their lives.
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:55.720]  Evil.
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:52:56.560]  It's evil.
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:57.840]  We are in a spiritual war.
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:00.280]  You know, this is a huge spiritual war in our country.
[1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:02.840]  Like you've been reporting for many of years,
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:03.920]  this is what's happening.
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:05.120]  It's already begun.
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:07.160]  And we are the ones that are forefronting this
[1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:09.000]  and we are not scared to make sure
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.760]  that people understand what we are here for.
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:12.920]  You know, the one A, the two A.
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:15.760]  And by the way, notice Antifa will never talk to a camera.
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:17.120]  We, if I've been to a hundred events,
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:18.920]  you've been to a hundred or more.
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:21.040]  They'll never talk, they can't talk.
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:23.080]  I get a conservative or a Christian on.
[1:53:23.080 --> 1:53:27.280]  It's like eloquent oratory, like a volcano.
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:29.480]  It's total night and day.
[1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:31.760]  Anytime you see a member of Antifa
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:33.800]  trying to thank for themselves and speak,
[1:53:33.800 --> 1:53:36.640]  you always see that one arm come and grab that person
[1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:38.720]  and pull them back into what they call the black block
[1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:39.560]  or whatever.
[1:53:39.560 --> 1:53:40.640]  And that guy disappears
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:42.360]  because you're not allowed to think for yourself.
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:43.480]  They just want drones.
[1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:45.440]  They want people who are going to stay in there in mass,
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:48.880]  beat drums, spit like llamas and swing clubs at people.
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:49.720]  That's right.
[1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:51.880]  It's not communist slogans.
[1:53:51.880 --> 1:53:54.240]  I want to get you all back on this week.
[1:53:54.240 --> 1:53:55.080]  You're amazing.
[1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.200]  Let's talk to Joe Oakman here.
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:53:58.040]  I was seeing him.
[1:53:58.040 --> 1:53:58.880]  I would say he's a magician.
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:53:59.960]  He's eight feet tall.
[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:01.360]  Joe Oakman, give us your take.
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:02.920]  You were saying you're being doxed.
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:03.960]  Others are being doxed.
[1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:07.000]  These are terrorists that go to the Senate leader's house.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.640]  They go to Tucker Carlson's house.
[1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:09.840]  They've been to other people's houses
[1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:12.520]  but I'm not going to mention it for security reasons
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:14.320]  because we don't want to let them know they've been to my house.
[1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:16.600]  So they've been to a bunch of Alex Jones's houses.
[1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:19.160]  There's like 10 Alex Joneses in town that get calls saying,
[1:54:19.160 --> 1:54:20.520]  there's people banging on my door.
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:21.360]  What do I do?
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:23.000]  And I'm like, well, I'm over here with black water.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:26.680]  So, but, but I mean, that's how crazy this has gotten.
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:27.520]  What have you gone through?
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:29.560]  I mean, you're not a victim, but these are terrorists.
[1:54:29.560 --> 1:54:31.920]  Tell us what's happened, Joe.
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:33.480]  Alex, first of all, thank you for having us on
[1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:35.840]  and giving voice to what we're trying to do here.
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:37.760]  So thank you very much for your large audience.
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:38.880]  So thank you.
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:43.360]  Made personally since yesterday overnight in a weird way.
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:47.960]  I've kind of become Antifa's biggest, biggest,
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:49.480]  I don't know, I don't mean biggest.
[1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:52.520]  They're bitterly big as they have a crush on me.
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:55.600]  Nemesis, they've got some sort of weird crush on me.
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:57.640]  It's flattering, but at the same time,
[1:54:57.640 --> 1:54:58.480]  I'm knowing what they do.
[1:54:58.480 --> 1:54:59.520]  It's dangerous.
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:01.720]  I'm not the only one though.
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:02.720]  Anybody that's been put,
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:04.000]  that gets put in front of a camera
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.320]  and voices their opinion for free speech
[1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:09.320]  and in support of this country, they become their enemy.
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:12.320]  I just happen to be a very big target at the moment,
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:15.680]  but that's not going to deter myself or any of the.
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:18.440]  Well, I mean, if you're a hunchback green skin devil
[1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:21.680]  worshipper, you know, like a six foot, seven, you know,
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:24.440]  good looking guy, whether white or black, whatever,
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:25.560]  they're scared of that.
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:27.600]  I mean, imagine you've got what they want.
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:30.120]  You're an American, you're well spoken, you're good looking,
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:31.160]  you've got courage.
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.240]  They're methods that work for George Soros.
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:34.640]  So of course they hate you.
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:37.440]  Actually, it's funny to say that,
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:40.600]  but 30 second story, when I was there at the event last night
[1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:41.680]  after our march was over,
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:45.040]  while one degree was being a superstar and CNN,
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:49.080]  I was approached by a self described Intipa member
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:51.040]  and we had a conversation.
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:53.600]  It was actually surprisingly calm,
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:55.760]  but he made comments about, look at you, your appearance,
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:57.600]  you're comfortable in your masculinity,
[1:55:57.600 --> 1:55:59.920]  you take care of yourself, blah, blah, blah.
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:01.680]  And I said, yeah, is there something wrong with that?
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:05.240]  He said, well, kind of you, you have this weird approach.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:07.080]  Everyone thinks you're a violence
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:09.840]  because I respect myself and my friends.
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:11.400]  Like, why am I violent?
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:14.920]  And then let's just say it, the left is the left hand path.
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:15.760]  They're satanic.
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:18.000]  They don't have the power.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.360]  They want us to stand down because let's just say it,
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:21.600]  we already have the power.
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:23.480]  We built the country, we built the world.
[1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:24.760]  They all want to come take it.
[1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:26.040]  It's a spiritual issue.
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:29.960]  Alex, it's not just myself or the gentleman in this room.
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:33.040]  It's not just every proud boy chapter in this country
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:35.600]  from California to Florida to Michigan.
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:39.280]  It's every red-blooded American man and woman
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:41.040]  in this country that loves their country.
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:45.240]  It's in your blood and it motivates you to be better.
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:47.400]  And that's why they tell us America sucks
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:48.720]  because it doesn't suck.
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:50.640]  They want to conquer it.
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:53.520]  No, here's the best part about the United States.
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:55.000]  Oh, you mentioned that E.O.G. Malone.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:56.920]  That's a great segue to the military.
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:59.280]  You have two veterans here, three veterans here.
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:00.920]  I'm sorry.
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:02.480]  You can't conquer this country
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:04.360]  by bringing shifts to our shores.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:05.600]  Well, you sure can try to poison it
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:07.520]  by injecting a virus into it.
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:09.160]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:12.920]  They're trying to inject a virus of hate into this country
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:14.160]  and overturn it from within.
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:16.680]  You're not going to come to our shores with any ships.
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:18.120]  But you might be able to do that.
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:21.160]  I think what we did yesterday was plant our flag
[1:57:21.160 --> 1:57:25.000]  in that soil and say, no, that virus isn't coming here.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:26.720]  The United States will be defended
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:29.880]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:31.880]  And I can't think of a better way to end the broadcast.
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:33.200]  We salute you all.
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:34.360]  Great job.
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:35.360]  Re-transmission coming up.
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:39.640]  Infowars.com, share this video, share this live show.
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:40.480]  Great job, guys.
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:41.320]  We salute you.
[1:57:41.320 --> 1:57:42.640]  Great job to the crew and the listeners.
[1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:44.640]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:50.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:52.400]  This isn't a long order TV program.
[1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:53.880]  This is reality.
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:55.840]  And I'll say this, it's all of our birthright.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:57:57.920]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight.
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:00.040]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:01.440]  We're seeing election meddling.
[1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:02.720]  And it's time to admit it
[1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:05.480]  and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor power grab.
[1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:07.920]  They didn't come like an enemy from over the horizon.
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:10.840]  They came from inside and they came through cyberspace.
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:13.880]  Our republic, our constitutional little de-democracy
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:14.720]  has been hacked.
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:16.600]  And please remember, without your financial support,
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:18.840]  we wouldn't have stood this withering storm
[1:58:18.840 --> 1:58:20.840]  of censorship, attacks and lies.
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:23.400]  We have the new World Awakens mega sale,
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:25.040]  globalist house of cards collapsing,
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:26.280]  end of summer super sale.
[1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:28.640]  It's the big giant 50 to 60% off,
[1:58:28.640 --> 1:58:30.640]  store-wide free shipping, double patriot points,
[1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:34.080]  but only on 50 something items, not on every item,
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:36.040]  because a bunch of these are very close to selling out,
[1:58:36.040 --> 1:58:37.160]  whether it's ultimate krill oil,
[1:58:37.160 --> 1:58:38.920]  bodies, turmeric, brain force plus,
[1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:41.920]  knockout sleep bag, turbo force, eight pack power stack.
[1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:44.480]  It's all 50 to 60% off and your purchases
[1:58:44.480 --> 1:58:46.160]  make it all possible here.
[1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:49.560]  As we witness the most disastrous
[1:58:49.560 --> 1:58:52.720]  geological activity in recorded history,
[1:58:52.720 --> 1:58:55.600]  the globalists are backed into a corner
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:58.440]  and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[1:58:58.440 --> 1:59:02.560]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:05.280]  The world is going to change
[1:59:05.280 --> 1:59:08.320]  and how it changes will likely be decided
[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:10.760]  by those who are prepared to stay strong
[1:59:10.760 --> 1:59:12.680]  when the system fails.
[1:59:12.680 --> 1:59:14.680]  The system is vulnerable.
[1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:17.400]  Electricity could be gone in an instant
[1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:21.000]  and grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.920]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water
[1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:27.920]  will give you a fighting chance in the next level
[1:59:27.920 --> 1:59:30.800]  and being without puts you at the mercy of others
[1:59:30.800 --> 1:59:33.880]  or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[1:59:33.880 --> 1:59:35.560]  Buy storable foods
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:39.040]  and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today.

[1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:46.800]  and support freedom by buying from infowarstore.com.
[1:59:46.800 --> 1:59:56.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
