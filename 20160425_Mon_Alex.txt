[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:15.000 --> 00:44.000]  These are interesting times. I'm pretty much off of sight of here in the morning, so I've been here getting ready, getting geared up, and then I'm back there in the control room dealing with a lot of other irons and the fires.
[00:44.000 --> 01:10.000]  I'm not prepared to launch this live, worldwide broadcast, but I'll tell you this. The fact that this broadcast is exploding in popularity is really only an indicator of how much trouble this culture is in that the general population of this nation and the world understands now that what we're talking about really is closer to reality than what mainstream media is pushing by a billion light years.
[01:10.000 --> 01:24.000]  Look, we're not perfect, we don't have all the answers, but we know this. The globalists are tyrants, they're coming after our freedoms, this is a very important broadcast today. First, I'd love to kick off with a John Bowne report, gun control rising as new world order media dies.
[01:24.000 --> 01:37.000]  While mainstream media, the failed propaganda goliath, desperately wheezes for air, swimming upstream in a raging river of American truth and relevance, the force of the new world order's establishment mind control is getting bolder.
[01:37.000 --> 01:52.000]  With Justice Scalia on the bench, one of the few areas where the court actually had an inconsistent record relates to gun control. Sometimes the court upheld local and state gun control measures as being compliant with the Second Amendment, and sometimes the court struck them down.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  They say they believe the next time the court rules on gun control will make a definitive ruling.
[01:59.000 --> 02:13.000]  At this point, it should come as no surprise that government engineered propaganda was legalized in the United States in 2013, slipped into the tyrannical bulwark NDAA of 2013 while America slept.
[02:13.000 --> 02:35.000]  Yeah, the same NDAA that gives the government the power to detain U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism indefinitely without charge or trial. And considering the fact that the establishment's number one target is domestic terrorists labeled as constitutionalists or patriots or even documentary filmmakers, that authorization is highly disturbing.
[02:35.000 --> 02:53.000]  So it should come as no surprise that the puppets with their perfect hair and hubris filled blank teleprompter reading minds are being forced to ratchet up a full-on cannibalistic assault on their own deteriorating journalistic integrity.
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  We should spend more time listening to what others have to say, unless focusing on the grammar what they say it with.
[02:59.000 --> 03:11.000]  Supporting mindless disinformation like this.
[03:11.000 --> 03:32.000]  And firing people like ESPN's recent firing of Kurt Schilling over the exercise over what is simply Schilling's free speech. The more this occurs, the more the disgust for mainstream media grows. Investors business daily writes, more information travels faster to more consumers than ever before.
[03:32.000 --> 03:41.000]  So why does a new survey show trust in media at rock bottom? Because so much more accurate information is available elsewhere.
[03:41.000 --> 03:58.000]  There is no incongruity in the fact that a new poll conducted by the Media Insight Project, a joint project of the American Press Institute and the Associated Press Center for Public Affairs Research finds the American media's popularity way down with that of Washington politicians.
[03:58.000 --> 04:07.000]  With 2014 adult surveyed, only 6% expressed a lot of confidence in the press.
[04:07.000 --> 04:23.000]  And in its technological haste to sell meaningless swill through click fading rather than focusing on what people truly want, real verifiable journalistic truth, social media and online journalism also created its own hyperactive click trap.
[04:23.000 --> 04:39.000]  TheInformation.com writes, digital media companies are caught in the crap trap, mass producing trashy click baits so they can claim huge audiences and often higher valuations. But that model failed, heralded by mass layoffs.
[04:39.000 --> 04:54.000]  As the crow flies, the days of cable network media being the successful and reliable source of unfiltered information it once was in the archaic past, will be as distant a memory as Brian Williams' career.
[04:54.000 --> 05:10.000]  John Baum, for info wars.com.
[05:25.000 --> 05:42.000]  Local law enforcement agencies are also sending officers to learn how to use Geiger counters and contain nuclear hot zones. The Nevada National Security Site, which is about 85 miles from Las Vegas, is best known for the 1955 Apple II nuclear test in which an atomic bomb was placed on a tower to blow up buildings and structures known as Survival Town.
[05:42.000 --> 06:00.000]  The blast delivered an explosive yield equivalent to 29,000 tons of TNT, much larger than the atomic bomb which exploded over Nagasaki, Japan at the final stage of World War II.

[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.

[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, FUFX, NACIN, all the time.
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  Why? Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  What products are you taking?
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Winterson, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  I got my bottle of BrainForce right there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.000]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[07:49.000 --> 08:00.000]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[08:00.000 --> 08:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us as we kick off another broadcast week.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  It is the 25th day of April, 2016.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  We'll be here for the next four hours.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour from London, England.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  We have Pastor Manning joining us to take your calls, talk politics and news,
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  and the second hour, always interesting, informative, always thought-provoking and entertaining with Pastor Manning.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  I personally love listening to a show and watching the show. He's just a really great guy, really smart.
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  He has street smarts, but also world smarts, but also political and religious smarts.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  He's just an amazing guy. He's spiritually smart.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  So that is coming up. We have a lot of really important special reports I want to get to.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  We have Prince murdered by the Illuminati. A lot of evidence points towards that John Bowne has done a report.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  That's what you call organized crime that isn't Italian. It's basically the Illuminati.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.000]  People say, what is it? It's secret societies that engage in criminal activity and have systems of social control.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  I'm going to talk about that at the bottom of the hour and play that report.
[09:39.000 --> 09:49.000]  Another really important report dealing with New World Order defends its sale of baby parts as that expands.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  So they've gone from denying they're selling baby parts to just admitting it and saying how wonderful it is.
[09:54.000 --> 10:01.000]  We'll also get into Obama threatening Great Britain that if they leave the EU, that the US will basically break its ties with them.
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  Not the Chinese Communist killers in the Pope and everybody else and all these dictatorships like Saudi Arabia.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  Oh, I'm sorry. They call them monarchies when it's a family dictatorship like North Korea.
[10:14.000 --> 10:23.000]  Excuse me. The monarchy of Saudi Arabia threatening the US not to elect Donald Trump.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  He's a nationalist. And then England and the UK is being threatened that they're being screwed over by the EU.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  It signs them on to all these debts that controls most of their laws and regulations and Obama's been over there for days.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  So has Hillary. She hasn't been over there, but she's been on record telling them what to do, how to behave.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  This is global government. So that is some of what we're going to be breaking down as well today.
[10:47.000 --> 11:06.000]  There is a topic that I want to throw out here before we get into the latest on the big primary situation coming up tomorrow where Donald Trump is surging in all the polls in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island.
[11:06.000 --> 11:16.000]  And by the way, he's going to need it because the ringer Kasek has now teamed up with Lion Ted, the Canadian.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  Nothing wrong with Canadians. It's just that, you know, he's up there, you know, north by Alaska.
[11:23.000 --> 11:32.000]  We got Lion Ted, the royal mounted police commander, the mounting, riding around his moose down here in Texas.
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  There's nothing more Texas than a Canadian riding a moose down Congress Street in Austin, Texas.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  I'm here to tell you he is all hat and all moose, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  In fact, he's a moose farmer. He's got moose rancher moose meat.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  I'm sorry. I'm really going over the deep end here today.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  They have announced that they are joining forces to combine their delegates.
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  And then, of course, Ted just had some more victories over the weekend, a couple more states where they had voterless victories,
[12:03.000 --> 12:11.000]  where people appointed by the party leadership, they then decide who the superdelegates are.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  And then I guess it just goes from there, or the superdelegates for the party leadership side of the delegates are.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  And of course, Rand Paul is going to be one of the superdelegates in Kentucky.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  And they're saying they're just going to give all the votes to Ted Cruz again there.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  And this is just really getting scary.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  And they're saying, oh, this is our system. Well, they've never really implemented it to that level.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  So we're going to be going over that the big steel in front of everyone.
[12:40.000 --> 12:53.000]  But if Donald Trump sweeps tomorrow and then sweeps coming up places like New Mexico and California and all those other western states coming up in the next month or so,
[12:53.000 --> 13:01.000]  if he sweeps those and dominates those, still he will get the 1,237.
[13:01.000 --> 13:11.000]  So that's why previous and other Republican cats, other Republican bigwigs, with those, you know what, eating grins on their faces,
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  are all over CNN Fox News saying, hey, the same story over and over again.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  It's never been this way. The delegates always decide. The superdelegates always decide.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  And that's not true.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  And I just keep repeating this because they keep lying.
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  In 1976, the Republicans changed it to basically let the party officials come in and take over delegates and steal elections.
[13:31.000 --> 13:39.000]  But just because you pass a rule that flies in the face of public elections and claim that you run the election system in this country,
[13:39.000 --> 13:47.000]  that will not stand up for real challenge in court because we have one person, one vote laws and we have taxpayer money spent on elections.
[13:47.000 --> 13:58.000]  And you have held out for decades, even under this system that you've had, that it's one person, one vote, and the people decide you are con artist frauds.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  And I'm calling you out previous and all the rest of you.
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  They were all over TV this weekend, like a bunch of demonic parrots bleeding and blurping and chirping and squawking.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  It doesn't matter what you say. It doesn't matter what you say. We vote. We vote. We have the votes.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  We have the votes. We're the party officials. We're the party officials. We vote. We vote. We vote.
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  There's no popular vote. There's no popular vote. There's no popular vote. No popular vote. No popular vote.
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  They may not even go with Kasek. We may not even go with Cruz. No, no, it might be Paul Ryan, might be Paul Ryan.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  Then they start squawking over and over again. Party officials said, party officials said, we decide not you.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  Never was a vote. You're crazy. Over and over and over again.
[14:43.000 --> 14:51.000]  The same mindless talking points with these stupid politicos can hardly even say a Senate straight when it's a talking point.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  And they say it and get it out and then smile like puppies that just did their first trick.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  And then you kind of squirt on themselves like a puppy you'll do when you're petting it.
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  I got a treat and like pee on themselves and I'm sorry to use that analogy, but that's what it looks like.
[15:08.000 --> 15:17.000]  Priebus and Curly, Hewland and all the rest of them get up on TV and they say with a smile on their face.
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  Oh, listen, it's always been like this and it's just he's a sore loser. He's mad that the voters have spoken.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  This is voters. It's how it voters and they smile.
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.000]  Look, Mommy, I lied. Look, a British psych warfare firm told me these lies and wrote out four or five lines.
[15:36.000 --> 15:45.000]  And I'm a big boy now. I go on TV and I say my line like I'm in the kindergarten play.
[15:45.000 --> 16:06.000]  Meanwhile, I wish Donald Trump would do more of his Hillary Clinton impressions
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  because it's just comedy gold. He's got great body posture.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  He knows how to pull it off. And I personally want to have a big lectern and put on a wig this week, guys.
[16:16.000 --> 16:23.000]  And I want to dress up like Hillary and actually take one of her speeches with a teleprompter.
[16:23.000 --> 16:28.000]  I guess we can rent one loaded up and actually give real quotes.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  She's given about we're going to get the guns with executive orders. Amen.
[16:32.000 --> 16:39.000]  We need to put men in fun camps. Socialism is good. I mean, these are real quotes.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  And just show people the body language of.
[16:44.000 --> 16:53.000]  Hello, I'm lying. Hillary, it's good to see you. I'm glad you're here. We're going to give you lots of free stuff.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  And when you actually see Trump do that, that's what they look like when Hillary and Obama go up and just turn.
[16:58.000 --> 17:05.000]  But Hillary's even worse. She just looks at a teleprompter, reads a line, turns to the next line, turns to the next line.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  And it's pure garbage. Speaking of Hillary's cough, she says it's allergies.
[17:10.000 --> 17:21.000]  And you know what? Maybe it is because I have a mold allergy and it's been raining for months here in Austin almost every day.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  I was up almost all night and it is mold because I went for a hike this morning and it's the mold.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  And I'm just going to have to stop hiking when the mold count is so high because I feel like I have fire ants in my bronchioles right now.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  So excuse me for the coughing her today.
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  Not good. I had a huge coughing fit over breakfast with my children this morning as well.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  My son asked me, he said, Daddy, turn into Hillary Clinton.
[17:45.000 --> 17:54.000]  And I said, maybe about to dress up like hers. I can even hack and cough and it won't be acting because I'll really be hacking and coughing.
[17:54.000 --> 18:01.000]  When I do the line, Hillary imitation.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  So that's coming up today as well.
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  But I want to kick off a topic for listeners first and kind of a thematic thing.
[18:09.000 --> 18:17.000]  I think really of the week and really of the month because we need to focus on this.
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  We need to really, in my humble view, let me know what you think.
[18:22.000 --> 18:34.000]  Let's get the globalist plans for us and why they're engineering a global collapse and why that makes it basically inevitable.
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  And how that ties in to this little grouping of articles.
[18:39.000 --> 18:48.000]  Beyonce invokes urban terrorism in new video veiled encouragement of violence typical of pop star.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  Veiled encouragement. But I'm not mad at my writers for saying that.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  I mean, they're trying to be conservative.
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  But when a woman's running around blowing things up, beating things up, attacking, saying she hates men and saying she hates police,
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  it's clear she's trying to get young people to go out and act like this and do this.
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  And this ties into what the establishment wants and how they want to treat people to behave.
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  And it ties into the CIA and other big think tanks and foundations.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  You guys get me some lung cleanse. I forgot to use that. Thank you.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  And what they're up to.
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  And that ties into this Michael Snyder article. We should get him on about this this week because I want this to be really, again, a theme we cover.
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.000]  Unhappy America will the United States collapse due to an internal societal meltdown.
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.000]  All great nations eventually fall and the United States is not going to be any expectation, any exception.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  So that's coming up. We're going to be talking about will the Republic survive?
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  What are the globalists plan to replace it with? Can we defeat?
[19:48.000 --> 19:56.000]  This new planetary dark age is being introduced and brought into place by design.
[19:56.000 --> 20:18.000]  Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war.
[20:27.000 --> 20:52.000]  Thank you.
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  Thank you.
[21:22.000 --> 21:29.000]  Thank you.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  Thank you.
[22:22.000 --> 22:29.000]  Thank you.
[22:52.000 --> 22:59.000]  Thank you.
[23:22.000 --> 23:29.000]  Thank you.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  Thank you.
[24:22.000 --> 24:32.000]  Thank you.
[24:32.000 --> 24:42.000]  Thank you.
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  Thank you.
[24:50.000 --> 25:00.000]  Thank you.
[25:00.000 --> 25:10.000]  Thank you.
[25:10.000 --> 25:19.000]  Thank you.
[25:19.000 --> 25:29.000]  Thank you.
[25:29.000 --> 25:39.000]  Thank you.

[02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  Thank you.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  Thank you.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  Thank you.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  Thank you.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  Thank you.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  Thank you.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  Thank you.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  Thank you.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  Thank you.

[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  Thank you.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:26.000]  Thank you.
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  Thank you.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  Thank you.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  Thank you.

[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  Thank you.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  Thank you.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:34.000]  Thank you.
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:59.000]  Thank you.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  Thank you.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:52.000]  Thank you.
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  Thank you.
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:46.000]  Thank you.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:24:12.000]  Thank you.
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  Thank you.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  Thank you.

[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  Thank you.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  Thank you.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  Thank you.

[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:34.000]  Thank you.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  Thank you.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  Thank you.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  Thank you.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  Thank you.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  Thank you.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  Thank you.

[02:36:44.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  Thank you.

[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  Thank you.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  Thank you.
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  Thank you.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  Thank you.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  Thank you.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  Thank you.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  Thank you.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  Thank you.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  Thank you.
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  Thank you.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  Thank you.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  Thank you.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  Thank you.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  Thank you.
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  Thank you.
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  Thank you.
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:45.000]  Thank you.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:47:12.000]  Thank you.
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  Thank you.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  Thank you.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  Thank you.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  Thank you.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  Thank you.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  Thank you.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  Thank you.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  Thank you.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  Thank you.
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  Thank you.
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  Thank you.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:38.000]  Thank you.
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  Thank you.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  Thank you.
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:54.000]  Thank you.
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  Thank you.
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  Thank you.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:55:20.000]  Thank you.
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  Thank you.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  Thank you.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  Thank you.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  Thank you.
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  Thank you.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  Thank you.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  Thank you.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  Thank you.
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  Thank you.
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:48.000]  Thank you.
[02:59:51.000 --> 03:00:20.000]  Thank you.
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:46.000]  Thank you.
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  Thank you.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  Thank you.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  Thank you.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  Thank you.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  Thank you.
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  Thank you.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  Thank you.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  Thank you.
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  Thank you.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  Thank you.
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:46.000]  Thank you.
[03:05:46.000 --> 03:06:14.000]  Thank you.
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  Thank you.
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:07:10.000]  Thank you.
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:38.000]  Thank you.
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:08:01.000]  Thank you.
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:14.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:27.000]  Well, that is the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones show.
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  And I'm from England, a country where our own national flag is called racist and banned.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  But waving an ISIS flag next to Parliament is perfectly fine.
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  Yes, that actually happened if you remember the story.
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  And I'm from Britain, a country where we let in 300,000 immigrants net every single year,
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  yet still revel in our own collective white guilt and ban our own flags to avoid offending immigrants.
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  Can you imagine a situation in the United States where on the 4th of July,
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  the local governments, the city governments ban the US flag, ban the display of old glory,
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  because it might offend Mexican immigrants, because it might offend Muslims.
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  Well, St. George's Day is nowhere on the scale of the 4th of July,
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  but it is England's national day, supposedly celebrating its heritage.
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:38.000]  But that is no longer permissible in the new multicultural society that we're now living under in today's day and age.
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  We got this story out of the Express, which Alex touched upon earlier.
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  Angers, council officials say UK city is too multicultural to celebrate St. George's Day.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  Too multicultural to celebrate our own country to display our own flag.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:05.000]  An English city council refused to host St. George's Day celebrations because the area is too multicultural.
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  And you know, Bristol is not even compared to many areas of London.
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:12.000]  That quote, multicultural.
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  So if it's happening in Bristol, it's happening everywhere else.
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  Bristol City Council allowed the national day to pass without a single event for the patron saint,
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  despite its history, dating back to 1222.
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  Council chiefs said 91 different languages are spoken in the town,
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  and it would be very difficult to commemorate them all.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:36.000]  Some in the area feel as though the English symbols have been hijacked by far-right groups
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  and are concerned about being branded racist.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  There's that collective white guilt once again.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  We're racist, even though we're letting 300,000 immigrants into a country with a population of 60 million every single year.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  That means we're racist, even though we're the most tolerant country in Europe for this.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  Gotta get that white guilt going.
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  According to the Daily Star Sunday,
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  Kathna Wolfe, founder of 91 Bays to Build a Global City,
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  which aims to unite Bristol's multicultural communities,
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  said people can be frightened of the white and red St. George's flag.
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  So because it triggers people, because it frightens them, because it violates their safe space,
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000]  it's banned.
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  This is the national flag of England.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  This is the national day of commemoration of England's history,
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  going back to 1222.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  And it's banned because it might offend minorities,
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  because it might offend immigrants,
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  because it might offend Muslims.
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:40.000]  What's not banned is if you're walking around the houses of Parliament, Westminster,
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  the very heart of government in the capital city of the country,
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  waving an ISIS flag.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  That's perfectly acceptable.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  This is from back in July, and we covered it at the time.
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  Police criticised for not arresting men carrying ISIS flag near Parliament.
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  Police had been criticised for failing to arrest a man who was seen wandering near Big Ben,
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:06.000]  draped in an Islamic state flag.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  The man was photographed walking past a group of scouts
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:15.000]  outside the houses of Parliament as he wore a large ISIS flag on his back.
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  He was carrying a small child on his shoulders who was waving a smaller flag in their hand.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  And you can go to the Guardian article and see the picture.
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  Giant Islamic state flag draped over most of his body,
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  walking around central London,
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:34.000]  walking past the houses of Parliament,
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  walking past Big Ben, draped in an ISIS flag.
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  That's perfectly acceptable.
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  It doesn't matter if that causes offence to anyone.
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  The very symbol of a group that has decimated,
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  that has massacred Christians across the Middle East,
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  that has beheaded people,
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  that has put people into tanks and drowned them alive,
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  that has burned people alive in cages.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000]  You can support them. You can wave their flag.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  That's perfectly acceptable to the man who takes offence.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  But God forbid, would you want to wave the flag of England?
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  The St George's Cross on St George's Day.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:17.000]  This is the state of political correctness in Great Britain.
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:20.000]  If you think you've got it bad in America,
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  you ain't seen nothing yet.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  And of course, it's not the first time we've seen this.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  In fact, I put an article out three years ago, May 2013.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  Council vetoes display of English flag because it's quote,
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  offensive to Muslims.
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  A local council in England vetoed the display of St George's
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  cross flag over concerns it would be offensive to Muslims
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  while allowing the rainbow flag of the lesbian, gay,
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  bisexual and transgender pride movement to be flown.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  And of course, the dichotomy is, what are they going to do
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  given how intolerant Muslims are towards gay people,
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000]  towards transgender people?
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  What are they going to do when they demand that those flags
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  be taken down?
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000]  Because they cause offence.
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  Because of course, as we saw from a poll a couple of weeks ago,
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:16.000]  52% of Muslims think that homosexuality should be illegal
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  in the United Kingdom.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:20.000]  Should we take offence to that?
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:22.000]  Or are we going to accept this?
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  Are we going to accept them when they call for the rainbow flag
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:28.000]  of the gay pride movement to be removed?
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  Leftists are going to have a certain dichotomy
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  when it comes to that situation.
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  To be fair, in the past, when this has happened,
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:40.000]  they've talked to more mainstream Muslim groups
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:43.000]  and asked them, what do you think about this?
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  Are you offended by the display of the English flag,
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:48.000]  the St George's Cross?
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  And as is quoted in this article, in fact,
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  a spokesman for the Bristol Muslim Cultural Society
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  where this flag, the display of this flag,
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  the commemoration of St George's Day was just basically
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  not recognized by the council.
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  He said, quote, used by the far right is one thing,
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  but to say that Muslims are offended, I don't think is correct.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  We understand the flag is part of this country's heritage,
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  and in fact, many Muslims will identify as being British themselves.
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  So even the Muslims themselves, when they ask them,
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  they're not even offended by it.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  So who are they trying to protect here?
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  These are the same councils that, for example,
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  in Rotherham, in Oxford, in Rochdale,
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  in all these different areas of the United Kingdom,
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  covered up, in some cases, for over a decade,
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  child grooming, child sex abuse trafficking scandals,
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  again, being run, being overseen by groups of Muslim men,
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  predominantly Pakistanis.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  In Rotherham, the council covered it up for 13 years
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:57.000]  while these children, who were mainly white girls,
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000]  were being abused.
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  When asked why, they said, well, political correctness.
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  We don't want to cause offence by drawing attention to the fact
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:11.000]  that this is a huge problem amongst Muslim communities,
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  amongst Pakistani Muslim gangs, where they kidnap children,
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  they sell them into the sex trade, they abuse them.
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  A number of these scandals across the United Kingdom,
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:26.000]  which have come out over the past five years,
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  and they covered it up to not cause offence.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  Just like now, they're telling people they can't display
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  the St. George's flag not to cause offence.
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  And in fact, if you look at this article from 2013,
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  there are more examples.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:44.000]  During the World Cup, okay, so this is soccer.
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:48.000]  This is not even affiliated with any kind of national celebration.
[03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  God forbid we would want to express any pride in our own country, right?
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:57.000]  That's not allowed anymore under this new culturally diverse society.
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:02.000]  But even during the World Cup, in Bolton, in Coventry,
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:07.000]  people were flying the St. George's flag to support the England soccer team.
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:10.000]  They were told by councils to take it down,
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  because it could be deemed racist.
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000]  This is the flag of England.
[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:18.000]  This is not, you know, a swastika.
[03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  This is not a KKK flag.
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  This is the flag of the country in which we live.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  In 2009, Labour-run Sandwell Council withdrew funding for a St. George's Day Parade,
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  citing fears that it might attract far-right elements.
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  So this hasn't just happened now.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:39.000]  This hasn't started in 2016.
[03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  We've been documenting this for at least seven, eight years.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:48.000]  This is the state of multiculturalism in Britain today.
[03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:52.000]  And on that note, moving on to our next article,
[03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  and this is going to be posted up on infowars.com here over the next 10, 15 minutes.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:00.000]  Former US diplomat,
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  suicidal migration policies will cause Europeans to flee their countries.
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:08.000]  Listen to these amazing quotes.
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:11.000]  This is former US diplomat Adam Topolanski,
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  who worked for the US State Department between 1984 and 1988.
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:21.000]  He warns that Europeans will flee their own countries
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:24.000]  as a result of suicidal migration policies
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:26.000]  that have seen millions of Muslim asylum seekers
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:29.000]  pour into the continent over the last year.
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  In our article for Hungary today,
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  and the article links through to that original editorial,
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  Topolanski says that European countries like Hungary and Czech Republic
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  that have refused to bow to the migrant influx
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  and, of course, have been labelled racist and xenophobic
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:48.000]  for merely wanting to protect the integrity of their own borders,
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:52.000]  will become a refuge for European citizens
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  who will become migrants in their own land
[03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:58.000]  as a result of mass Muslim immigration.
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:00.000]  Listen to this quote.
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:04.000]  Tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of German, Dutch, French, Belgian,
[03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:09.000]  and other Western European citizens may opt to move to Hungary
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:15.000]  in the next 10, 20 to 30 years and settle there in the wake of the migration crisis.
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:20.000]  He adds that, quote, reverse migration is a predictable trend
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.000]  because European citizens, quote,
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:26.000]  will want to escape their leader's suicidal migration policies
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:30.000]  and will seek a safer place to retire.
[03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  This is a former top US diplomat, worked for the US State Department,
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  basically saying that European citizens
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  are going to become migrants on their own continent.
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  Western Europe is going to be overtaken by this mass wave of Muslims
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:50.000]  and that central Eastern European countries, like the Czech Republic,
[03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:55.000]  like Hungary, are going to become a new refuge for Europeans fleeing from the West.
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  We'll get into it more after the break. This is the Alex Jones Show Live, Stay tuned.
[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:30.000]  Meals like pasta, Alfredo, cheesy lasagna, breakfast, dessert, drinks and snacks,
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:33.000]  just add water and your family is eating delicious food

[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:02.000]  Are you concerned about the power grid?
[03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  About the new war on the power grid?
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:09.000]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000]  and the most valuable. Here's why.
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:17.000]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just been written.
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:21.000]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:24.000]  but only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:40.000]  Why do this? Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:43.000]  The answer is simple. America's power grid is in grave danger
[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:47.000]  and most Americans are clueless. Find out what's going on behind the scenes
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:50.000]  and why the most common question this author gets is,
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  do you fear for your life? Go to waronthegrid.com.
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  That's waronthegrid.com.

[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes to bat for you by in term life insurance.
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:13.000]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:17.000]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  I said, let me see.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated, price competitive companies we represent
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:30.000]  and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes,
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  experience and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.000]  How about you?

[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  We're going to be sending more reporters to Bilderberg this year.
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  And that doesn't come cheap when you're sending people not only all over the US,
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  but all over the globe to cover these developments.
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  So please show your support as you have done and continue to do so at infowarsstore.com.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:57.000]  So basically in Europe, we've got local government councils saying that
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:02.000]  it's offensive and racist to commemorate our own country's history,
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  but walking around the centre of London, right outside the houses of parliament,
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  waving an ISIS flag, is perfectly acceptable.
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  This is the attitude that leads to the dissolution of Western society.
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  The collapse of Western civilization, and that's exactly what this former top US diplomat,
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  Adam Topolanski, is warning about in his editorial,
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  suicidal migration policies will cause Europeans to flee their countries.
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:38.000]  So he's basically predicting that by 2050, Muslim migrants,
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  and this is just a statistical fact, if you drill down into the numbers,
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  that are being imported every single year, if that continues,
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  then these Muslim ghettos, which created the Paris massacre,
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  which created the Brussels metro and airport bombing,
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:04.000]  will not only continue to develop, but they will continue to spread to more areas of major cities.
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  And he's basically saying that the few countries, the likes of Hungary, Croatia, Czech Republic,
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  that have refused to bow down, that have actually defended the integrity of their own borders,
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  of their own national identity, those will become the safe havens for Europeans to go and live.
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  Simply to be safe, simply to avoid mass societal disorder and civil unrest,
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  which we know separately, the elite are preparing for.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:38.000]  Quote, whatever the future will bring, one thing is predictable.
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  The preferred place for all Europeans by the middle of the century
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  may wind up to be East Central Europe.
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  So what this top former US diplomat is saying about the migrant crisis,
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  that it's destabilized the continent, that it's, quote, altered the way of life,
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:27:00.000]  the religious and cultural fabric.
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  And that's exactly the point. I mean, Angela Merkel herself admitted back in 2010,
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  along with David Cameron, that multiculturalism has failed.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:16.000]  And you can see that with your own eyes, if you go into any of these so-called diverse areas
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:22.000]  in major European cities, go into Molenbeek, not very diverse.
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  Go into certain areas of Paris, again, not very diverse.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  Go into areas of East London, go into Whitechapel, go into Tower Hamlets.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  In fact, if you go on my Twitter, you can see a video walkthrough of Whitechapel in East London.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  See how diverse that is.
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  None of this is diverse.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  The very same white middle class liberals who preach all day about open borders,
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  they don't live in these migrant areas.
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:55.000]  There's no diversity because they don't want to live there,
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  because it's not a nice place to live. It's a crap hole, I'm sorry.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  Because these people have no loyalty to the country, and we've asked them in polls and they've said that.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  That's why these middle class liberals don't want to live there.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:13.000]  They talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk.
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  Diversity doesn't work. It hasn't worked.
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  It's created ghettos, which have become centers of radicalization for ISIS terrorists,
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  as ISIS said in their own manifesto, was their plan.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:35.000]  It's a hijacked the migrant crisis to create more radicalized ghettos in major European cities
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  to use as bases to launch new attacks.
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  That's exactly what we saw in Paris.
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  That's what we saw in Brussels, Belgium,
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:49.000]  and that's what we're going to see over the next 10 years throughout Europe.
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:52.000]  And every time there's another major attack,
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:58.000]  the left is going to go on Twitter and start a hashtag, you know, pray for Berlin,
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:02.000]  pray for Dresden, pray for Munich, wherever else it happens next.
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  They're going to go on the street, they're going to hug a Muslim,
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  and it's going to do absolutely nothing.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:11.000]  It's only going to embolden our enemies,
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  and it's only going to obfuscate and hide the fact that many of these extremists,
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  many of these jihadists have support from Islamists who are living in our communities.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:30.000]  That's how Salah Abdeslan was able to escape capture the Paris massacre culprit
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:36.000]  for three months living in Molenbeek amongst his friends and family, who protected him.
[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  And when the police showed up to try to arrest him,
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:44.000]  they were pelted with stones and rocks by the rest of the people in Molenbeek.
[03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:48.000]  That's your diversity, that's your multiculturalism, it's failed.
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:49.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:53.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.000 --> 03:30:20.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:25.000]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you, what I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:30.000]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:33.000]  And I'm really am asking you, it's more than a process question.
[03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:38.000]  It's an integrity of the election question, and everybody's asking me this question,
[03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:40.000]  so I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:45.000]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.
[03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:48.000]  Why do you do this every single time?
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:51.000]  But no, you gotta stop, every time I have you on the air.
[03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:21.000]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:06.000]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:11.000]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:16.000]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride,
[03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:19.000]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:22.000]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:29.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:36.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:32:36.000 --> 03:32:42.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:44.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:32:44.000 --> 03:32:50.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:25.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:31.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  You're back. It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show and that article I was talking about before the break.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:34:02.000]  So get that out. Again, amazing quotes.
[03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:11.000]  Switzerland, Norway, all of these countries who are saying that the pace of this, the breakneck speed of importing these millions of migrants
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  is going to lead to civil unrest, to social disorder. It's going to lead to mass resentment, as is already happening,
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  in Germany, which is why they have to cover up the fact that all these crimes, all these rapes are being committed by these migrants.
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:33.000]  That's why they had to cover up the Cologne mass molestation on New Year's Eve for days because they, quote,
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:41.000]  want to legitimize critics of mass migration. They care more about the narrative than they do about the safety of women
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  or the very existence of Western civilization. These people, these political leaders have completely sold us out.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:57.000]  And even in Sweden now, they're getting uppity about it. Sweden, the country where some of the politicians there want to give
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:07.000]  the ISIS jihadists jobs and welfare. That is the liberal basket case that Sweden has become, where the government demands that people
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:17.000]  hand over their garages to house refugees or you're a racist. But now Zero Hedge reports, Swedes revolt over refugees
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:23.000]  near schools, demand effing answers from Stockholm City Council.
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:29.000]  This is a quote, you can watch the video, you can't just sit there when we come here looking for answers and say you can't answer that.
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  That is not okay. There has to be some effing order in a democracy, but you are not answering our questions.
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:41.000]  We all want effing answers. We will stop shouting when you answer our questions.
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  So it was basically a council meeting during which they were debating the council's plans to relocate hundreds of Muslim migrants
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  right next to a school and these Swedish people in Stockholm aren't very happy about it.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:36:07.000]  Gee, I wonder why? Could it be because of the colossal amount of young girls and children being raped near schools?
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  Which is why a school in Bavaria, as we reported last year, sent a letter home to parents telling them not to let their daughters wear short skirts
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  because they housed migrants in a nearby gymnasium. In fact, the gymnasium was attached to the school.
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  They just turned it over to migrants because they basically got no space left in Germany.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:36.000]  They're kicking out Germans out of social housing to house migrants and they said, look, these people are from a different culture.
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  Some of them like to rape young girls. So it's not like, well, what should we do about that? That's a horrible culture.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:49.000]  Why are we importing that? What the hell is going on? No, it's you have to adopt to their bad culture.
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  Not we have to reject their culture in the first place. That's what's happening in Europe.
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  And now even Swedes are up in arms about it. Zero Hedge also reported this weekend.
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  Swedish Muslim politician quits after refusing to shake women's hands.
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:20.000]  Of course, we've seen that before. We saw it in England, a video a couple of weeks ago, one of the local councillors who supposedly, you know, represents the resident living in the town refuses to shake a woman's hand.
[03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:30.000]  Again, because he's from a terrible culture that is intolerant and that treats women little better than farmyard animals when you get down to it.
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  Kit Daniels just put up an article in infowars.com. Activists expose illegal Sharia law court.
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  Muslim migrants create their own state within a state.
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  The shocking video shows activists exposing a Sharia law court operating inside London and outside British law.
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:57.000]  The court, publicly known as the Islamic Sharia Council, is one of an estimated 100 Sharia law courts carrying out legal matters in the UK in accordance with Islamic law.
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:38:05.000]  And again, these are the courts that run parallel to British law, i.e. in direct violation of it, but that's OK.
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:08.000]  Because we don't want to offend the precious Muslims, of course.
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:11.000]  And in these courts, you know, women are disenfranchised.
[03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  Men can get divorced by just saying, I divorce you and that's it.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:24.000]  For women, it's virtually impossible, even if they're in an abusive relationship, which often they are because they're treated as second-class citizens.
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:28.000]  And then you look at polls support for Sharia law.
[03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  Again, huge numbers of Muslims living in the UK support it.
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  A majority of Muslims living in the Middle East support it.
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  And you know, eventually it doesn't just stop at disenfranchising women in divorce courts.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:52.000]  It extends to more glorious examples of good culture, like chopping people's hands off for stealing and stoning gay people to death.
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:56.000]  That Sharia law, as it operates in some countries in the Middle East.
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  And now it's slowly creeping into Britain.
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  Breitbart reports, and I've got a ton of this news.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:12.000]  I'm just going to keep going with it because it's just effusive every single week pouring out of every orifice, this takeover of Europe.
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  In Sweden, migrant wife beaten for wanting to learn Swedish.
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  So this is someone who is trying to assimilate. We can't have that.
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:24.000]  Let's beat the crap out of them.
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:41.000]  An asylum seeker living in Sweden beaten kicks his wife in the head because she was reading to learn Swedish police have confirmed the 37 year old Afghan migrant launched the attack on his 32 year old wife yesterday in an attack that was witnessed by other migrants at their asylum center.
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:55.000]  And again, a lot of these migrant attacks on even taking place, you know, in the streets, they're taking place in these migrant centers to the point where police in many towns and villages in Germany have just said we're not going to go there anymore.
[03:39:55.000 --> 03:40:09.000]  Because they're being so overstretched, they're being called out to riots to mass brawls in these migrant centers between people coming from different countries because of course most of them aren't Syrian, a lot of them are North African.
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  They're being called out for migrants, you know, beating and killing their wives.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  We had a case a couple of weeks ago where a migrant just killed his wife.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:24.000]  So this is what what's happening in these migrant centers. So it's not just out on the streets.
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  But don't worry because the Pope is coming to the rescue once again.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  Report. This is our truth revolve. Pope ditched two refugees once he found out they were Christians.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  One of the most appalling aspects of the current refugee crisis is that persecuted Christians across the Middle East have been completely ignored in favor of Muslim migrants and you can see the truth of that in the numbers.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  And in fact, CNS News does a new report on it every single week where they say, you know, number of Muslim migrants admitted to Europe over the past month.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  And it's something like, you know, thousands and thousands of Muslims and like three Christians.
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  And of course, the number of Muslims is going to be greater.
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  But not to that degree, unless there's a deliberate policy or there's more of an urge on behalf of Muslims to get to Europe.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:30.000]  So even when the world's most prominent Christian figurehead does nothing to help but instead worships at the altar of multiculturalism and its new world order, what hope is there for Middle East Christians fleeing genocide?
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  The disturbing report claims that when Pope Francis found out that two of the 12 Muslim refugees he recently planned to take back to the Vatican turned out to be Christians, he quote, dropped them like a hot potato.
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  This is the Pope we're talking about. Rula and Melek Abbo, a Christian brother and sister duo who hail from Syria, say they've been let down by the Pope after he left them behind at Lesbos refugee camp.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:01.000]  They were promised a new life in Italy.
[03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  The two were, two of the lucky chosen 12 refugees selected by the Vatican to be taken from the desperate camp and housed in Rome, but what seemed like the chance of a lifetime was cruelly snatched away.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:24.000]  When they were told the following day they couldn't go. Instead, three Muslim families were taken because we don't have enough Muslims pouring in, thousands and thousands compared to a handful of Christians.
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  The Pope rejected the Christians and again chose the Muslims.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  This is the same Pope who has completely betrayed Catholics by adopting this ridiculous one world order global religion, this global warming climate change crap which he constantly pushes.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  This is a Pope who has betrayed Christians and a very real world example that happened once again.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:43:02.000]  Daily Mail reports, Afghan couple who have nine children and received 5000 a month in benefits have asked for free IVF treatment after arriving in Austria.
[03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:11.000]  Again debunking the argument that we need all these migrants for cheap labor and that they're such a boon to the economy and they don't drain our resources at all.
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  Even though in countries like Sweden the majority of welfare payments go to migrants despite the fact that they only make up about 7% of the population, 58% of welfare payments in Sweden go to migrants because most of them of working age are not working.
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:47.000]  Again debunking that argument that we need them for cheap labor, that's disproven by the Czech Republic, a country that has had a stable population for 100 years that has had very limited immigration and yet which is the most thriving economy in Europe,
[03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:59.000]  high standard of living, affordable housing for the population, great place to visit for a holiday, you know, high quality of life because they've had a stable migration level.
[03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:10.000]  They took in skilled immigrants which is always a good idea. They've kept out the hordes of people who are just going to suck off the welfare system and their economy has prospered.
[03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:15.000]  So again debunking this argument that we need them all for cheap labor.
[03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  Over in France, they're feeling the full effect of this cultural enrichment once again.
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  Video shows migrant women beat 16 year old girl for wearing a dress. Video out of France shows a group of migrant women beat a 16 year old girl.
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  They labelled as a slot for wearing a dress. As the victim reportedly did not know the assailants, the attack appears to have been a random act of violence.
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  Fortunately a man was able to pull away the most vicious assault.
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  And if you look at this woman, she's literally like six foot four, a giant hunk of a woman, a land whale if you will, and she's basically beating the crap out of this poor girl.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  Because she's wearing a dress in France, in Western Europe, again another example of cultural enrichment. Need I go on?
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  Mail Online reports US Embassy worker who ran Bangladesh's only LGBT magazine is hacked to death by Islamist militants along with another person after receiving threats online.
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:24.000]  So LGBT advocates in countries like Bangladesh are being hacked to death for publishing magazines yet.
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  What is the British Foreign Office concerned about? Well they're concerned about North Carolina's bathroom law.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  And the fact that, you know, a tiny proportion of the population which identifies as transgender 0.03% might be offended by having to use the bathroom of the biological birth.
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:52.000]  Well, God forbid. Meanwhile, LGBT advocate hacked to death in Bangladesh. Nobody's talking about it, nobody cares.
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  Transgender bathroom's more important, of course.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:46:14.000]  Switching gears now, we're going to go to this Mark Dice video. He basically went out to the beach in San Diego and asked Americans what they thought about the fact that the word gullible had been removed from the dictionary. Here's the clip.
[03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:27.000]  Words that enter the public lexicon like selfie and twerking and they're added to the dictionary. The Webster's dictionary company has been removing words to make room for new words.
[03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  It removes, amongst other things, the word gullible from the 2016 dictionary edition to make words for like, twerking.
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:49.000]  Okay. Do you think that was the right decision to do? No. Do not. Do you think maybe they should have just added a few extra pages instead of removing words like gullible from the dictionary?
[03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:54.000]  Yeah, I agree. But I gotta run. Alright, thank you.
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:47:07.000]  This year, the dictionary has decided to remove some older words that aren't being used as much. One of those words is gullible. Not enough room in the dictionary, apparently, with all the new words coming into use.
[03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:15.000]  Do you think that's the right decision or should they just have maybe like added some extra pages to the new dictionary editions?
[03:47:15.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  Yeah, I believe it's always best to add to the dictionary, you know, because, you know, everybody is, you know, trying to learn more and, you know, add to life. So, yes, I believe you should add to it.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:36.000]  Do you think the word gullible is still relevant today? Yeah, I gotta call that yesterday. I gotta call that yesterday.
[03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  Oh, no. That's not fair. So you think gullible should still be included in the dictionary? Yeah. Any thoughts on the dictionary company removing the word gullible from next year's editions?
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:48:02.000]  It doesn't really make any sense because it wouldn't cost much just to add more pages and add more words. Why would you want to remove? It's like, why would you want to remove knowledge?
[03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  We're trying to find out. We're just getting people's thoughts. It doesn't appear to make any sense whatsoever.
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:33.000]  That's just a sample of the insanity that you'll find on my YouTube channel.
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:47.000]  Also, you went out in the beach and asked people what they thought about the word intelligence being removed from the dictionary. And of course, in every single example, they actually believed him that that was what was happening.
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:49:07.000]  There's an interesting article on The Guardian in relation to this by Sandy Mann, you know, trying to get to the bottom of why people appear to be more dumbed down, why they appear to be more tuned out of reality, despite the fact that the internet has given us basically the world's knowledge base at our fingertips.
[03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:24.000]  Why do people seem to be dumber, more zombie-like, more zoned out than ever before? Could it be the ubiquitousness of mass entertainment? Sandy Mann argues that constant over-stimulation and faster-paced amusements have resulted in attention spans shorter than those of goldfish.
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:38.000]  And that's been scientifically proven now. Less than eight seconds. Quote, we are hard-wired to seek novel to which produces a hit of dopamine. The feel-good chemical in our brains as soon as the new stimulus is noticed is no longer new.
[03:49:38.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  And after a while, it bores us to get that same pleasurable dopamine hit. We seek fresh sources of distraction. So again, it goes to the point of these knowledge-gathering tasks, you know, which require intense study over a period of hours becoming harder to perform because people just aren't using those mental muscles.
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  They're beginning to atrophy because people are just constantly distracted by the phone, you know, by watching the next two-minute YouTube clip, by whatever. They mentally can't sit down and let a significant amount of information wash over them to actually absorb it.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  They can't do it anymore because their brains have atrophied because they're so used to being distracted every eight seconds, their attention spans are now less than a goldfish.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  So what is the consequence? I mean, people don't absorb enough information. They absorb a little bit of everything which is so superficial, it's completely meaningless.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  Which is why, as Mark Dice has proven time and time again, people no longer know basic facts about their own environment, about their own history, about their own freedoms, but they probably know everything about Beyoncé.

[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  and how this is dumbing us down because of course we're being constantly distracted.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  One of those distractions as Alex has talked about at length today and he's been attacked for it is Beyonce.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  Now, this is a truly dreadful human being who is hurting black people. This is a soulless political prostitute.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:46.000]  She constantly hijacks these poisonous, divisive cultural narratives for profit.
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:54.000]  We saw it with the whole feminism gig, even though her husband Jay-Z has got the most misogynistic lyrics imaginable.
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:56:01.000]  He cheats on her, but of course she's a big feminist, she's a big icon, not because she gives a damn about women's rights.
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  I've never heard her talk once about female genital mutilation in the Middle East, about female drivers being treated as terrorists in Saudi Arabia.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:20.000]  No, it's all about the completely fraudulent myths that can be blamed on the non-existent Western patriarchy, the rape culture that doesn't exist,
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  the man-spreading, all the fallacious nonsense that feminists make up while ignoring real human rights, real women's rights issues.
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  So of course she's come out with this new music video, which is basically riot chic.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  It's timed perfectly to cash in on this divisive Black Lives Matter movement, which if you will recall, is based on their ideological inspiration, is on the FBI's most wanted domestic terrorist list,
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  as Sarta Shakur, she's a convicted cop killer. So it's no surprise that the more radical fringe elements of this movement have killed cops as part of Black Lives Matter revenge attacks as we saw in New York City.
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:17.000]  A couple of Christmases ago with Ishmael Brinsley, they've plotted to bomb police stations and they've openly marched down the street in their hundreds calling for dead cops.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  We played that video before. So now Beyonce is cashing in on that divisiveness with this riot chic video.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:30.000]  Of course, the mainstream media has been in the can for that narrative the whole time.
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:40.000]  You know, Time Magazine, Indefensive Looting after Ferguson, they've made it into something acceptable and it's incredibly harmful to Black people because it's teaching them,
[03:57:40.000 --> 03:57:48.000]  you don't need to work hard, you don't need to be intelligent, you don't need to concentrate on your education, you don't need to concentrate on building a business.
[03:57:48.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  You just need to be full of grievance and blame white people for everything and riot and burn down your own communities.
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:58:08.000]  And now Beyonce is feeding into that narrative, which is very odd because as little as six years ago, she was marching alongside riot police during her 2010 Grammy performance.
[03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:18.000]  So again, complete hypocrisy. She flipped flops from one narrative to the next, simply to cash in, simply to exploit these divisive cultural narratives.
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:24.000]  Now even Obama has come out and said that Black Lives Matter activists should stop yelling at people.
[03:58:24.000 --> 03:58:29.000]  So even Obama now has had a backlash against BLM.
[03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:39.000]  So that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour. Check out the radio show 11 Stoogs Tomorrow and Infowars Nightly News tonight, breaking news at infowars.com.
