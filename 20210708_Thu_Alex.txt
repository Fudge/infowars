[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  The more things change, the more they stay the same, it's July 8th, 2021 Thursday, as we are live.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  It's a war, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:18.000 --> 00:42.000]  Send in the clouds, don't bother their heels.
[00:42.000 --> 00:51.000]  Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer?
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you for joining us.
[00:56.000 --> 01:07.000]  I told you that you would see, about a month ago on air, public declarations on TV that were coming to have sex with your children.
[01:07.000 --> 01:18.000]  In the Old Testament, it talks about Sodom and Gomorrah, and they come to the door and give us your women, your men, your children, or having sex with them, a big gang of rapists.
[01:18.000 --> 01:30.000]  Well, you could say that's fiction if you want, but it's happening again, and now the San Francisco Orchestra of the San Francisco Choir is, quote, gay now, which really means pedophilia,
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  and they've come out and said, we're recruiting your children, we're coming, we're going to get them, we're coming for them.
[01:36.000 --> 01:44.000]  But we already know that, and this is the revolution of vampirism, of sucking the energy out of the innocents.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  They put it up on YouTube, got 99% downvotes, they pulled it, but we saved it.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  Here they are with their declaration of war on our children.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable than seeing it.
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone, no one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[02:19.000 --> 02:35.000]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up? You could be a drag queen superhero.
[02:49.000 --> 03:05.000]  Your children will care about their needs and justice for others. Your children will work to convert all their sisters and brothers.
[03:05.000 --> 03:26.000]  Then soon they're almost certain your kids will start converting you. The gay agenda is coming home. The gay agenda is here.
[03:26.000 --> 03:36.000]  But you don't have to worry about me. There's nothing wrong with standing by our side. Can I put an end to me?
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  Look how neat and aesthetic and like still stuck to all those men look.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  Raised on chemicals, totally fried, and now all they want is like zombies want brains.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  As in art times they don't have them, well they want the innocence of children.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  Will convert your children. It's a religion like Islam.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  Because we bow to it.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  These are men that are going to recruit your children and have a relationship with them and convert them.
[04:14.000 --> 04:38.000]  It's not the gay San Francisco choir, it's the pedophile promoting LGBTP.
[04:38.000 --> 04:47.000]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston public library as part of its drag queen story hour.
[04:47.000 --> 04:56.000]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens Tatiana Malanina is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[04:56.000 --> 05:11.000]  Oh really? It's not a woman? It's a man. It's like a woman raping kids. Who would have thought?
[05:11.000 --> 05:27.000]  It's like a woman trying to take over, trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[05:27.000 --> 05:42.000]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[05:48.000 --> 05:57.000]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[05:57.000 --> 06:04.000]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[06:04.000 --> 06:16.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:16.000 --> 06:26.000]  It is a unified globalist operation. They want our children, they want our wives, they want our husbands, they want our parents, they want us dead.
[06:26.000 --> 06:35.000]  But not before they ceremonially rape us genetically, financially, spiritually, culturally.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  This is all about conquest, it's all about dominance, it's all about power.
[06:40.000 --> 06:53.000]  You have the Bilderberg group, Davos meeting of Big Tech meeting in Idaho under armed guards and paramilitary forces and on the main agenda is the gay agenda for children.
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  They actually say teaching tolerance, LGBT.
[06:59.000 --> 07:16.000]  And now, the San Francisco Orchestra, the San Francisco Men's Choir, the Pedophile Choir, they said we will corrupt your kids, close quote, we will recruit them, we will take them over.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  They are ours, we are quote coming for them.
[07:21.000 --> 07:35.000]  These are quotes, but hey, I've got the head of the UN Global Rapid Response Force, Dr. Ryan saying a year ago that once they phase in lockdowns, they'll become permanent for any new flu or cold.
[07:35.000 --> 07:44.000]  And that they're going to go into our homes and take the children and others to isolation centers and he starts licking his lips.
[07:44.000 --> 07:55.000]  The children are the target, they illegally injected entire schools in Australia, the health minister said screw you, big deal, get over it, I've got that video coming up.
[07:55.000 --> 08:04.000]  We have in New Zealand, remember it's a global system just like in Canada, saying we will hunt you down if you don't take your shots, we will arrest you, that's coming up.
[08:04.000 --> 08:23.000]  But here's the White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, saying strike forces, that's a paramilitary term, remember Obama said, we need a civilian force just as big, just as strong as our military, they would do it under the guise of community organizing and health department checks.
[08:23.000 --> 08:33.000]  And globally, here it is, the UN in charge of what you can say, what your doctor can do, what treatments you have, who would have thought in the world government day one, the UN is in charge of your medical, the UN is in charge of your speech.
[08:33.000 --> 08:44.000]  The UN is in charge of your speech through big tech with AI enforcing it, but it's all here. So, Saki two days ago said, oh, we're going to come to your house, people couldn't believe it, then Biden said, no, we're coming to your house to give you the shot.
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.000]  Now they're saying, well, we're probably going to push it on you, it's going to be mandatory, we've got strike forces.
[08:50.000 --> 09:02.000]  He thought that was the Delta Force, the Navy SEALs, no, no, no, it's the leftist coming into your life to contact trace you via an app on your phone with little fake robot readers the size of a credit card reader
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  to quote PCR test you, or if you look like you're sick, they have this new authority outside of law to disappear you.
[09:08.000 --> 09:18.000]  It's called martial law takeover. Now the Canadian health minister said, oh, this is about control of information and our revolution. That's why the lockdowns continue.
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  While they bankrupt all the small businesses, this is economic warfare. This is the new warfare. It's here. We're inside the new order.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  The full video is on info wars.com. Here is the press secretary on strike forces coming to your house.
[09:32.000 --> 09:41.000]  First, is there a target for herd immunity for COVID vaccines? Is it 75%, 80%? What is that goal to the administration right now?
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  Well, Dr. Fauci has addressed this a number of times and has conveyed that herd immunity is kind of an outdated term.
[09:46.000 --> 09:56.000]  So we had set a goal of reaching 70% of adults by July 4th. We reached that goal of adults 27 and older by that date.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  And we're continuing to press to reach it. And we will in the next couple of weeks for adults over the age of 18.
[10:02.000 --> 10:13.000]  But our work doesn't stop there. And we are going to continue to press to get 12 to 18 year olds vaccinated to continue to work with communities where there's lower vaccination rates.
[10:13.000 --> 10:26.000]  That's one of the reasons we initiated these strike forces to go into communities and work with them to determine what they need to take a localized specific approach that works with elected officials and communities.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  But I don't have a new goal to set for you.
[10:29.000 --> 10:38.000]  Strike forces. Strike forces. Military. Oh, you wear a mask. You're dirty. Oh, you can't go outside unless you've had the shot. That's their goal.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  Oh, the strike force is for you. It's all the official plans. The Little Millindegates Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, they're all getting billions of taxpayer money.
[10:47.000 --> 10:59.000]  And they've trained up these groups to go out on TV and normalize, not just forcibly inoculating like you saw in California, of people's children that didn't want it or of disabled people.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  People in the wheelchair. No, please don't. Oh, we're sorry.
[11:02.000 --> 11:20.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be big tech surveilling you and tracking you with the apps they put on your phone, whether you were like it or not, you can't install them, sending these paramilitary forces to your homes.
[11:20.000 --> 11:30.000]  This has always been the plan. It's the same from Spain to New Zealand to Canada. And now next it's coming here, like I kept telling you, it's a UN Directive Global Plan.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  But Australia's made up of great people, but it was a penal colony, so they never got their real rights.
[11:36.000 --> 11:49.000]  And blue cities under global control, they don't have any other basic rights. And so they're beta testing it, perfecting it, testing the media there, making sure no one resists, and then rolling it out against the next group.
[11:49.000 --> 11:58.000]  We told you over a year ago it'll be variants. Oh, they locked down Sydney again. The Delta Plus variant inspired it.
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  Like it's artwork. Oh, no one's really dying, but don't worry. In the fall and winter, when people don't get enough vitamin D, folks will die from regular viruses.
[12:07.000 --> 12:17.000]  We're going to lock down again. Well, don't wait. They've already done it again. And Biden's considering new lockdowns to squeeze that middle class into oblivion.
[12:17.000 --> 12:35.000]  So here is the Australian health official. We'll get to in a moment, responds aggressively when asked about the government was embarrassed about mistakenly distributing COVID jabs forcibly to 160 grade 12 students.
[12:35.000 --> 12:45.000]  Just ordering them to was all beta test. But first let's play this next clip. New Zealand will hunt down those not vaccinated says the government with strike teams. Here it is.
[12:45.000 --> 12:53.000]  I think the early next year will be in the phase of chasing up people who haven't come forward to get their vaccination or have missed their bookings and so on.
[12:53.000 --> 13:00.000]  So everyone will be able to get a vaccine between now and the end of the year. But of course, you know, and I want every New Zealand to come forward.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  But human behavior suggests that there will be some people that we have to actually really go out and look for.
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.000]  And some of that may spill into next year. But our commitment is everyone will have the opportunity to get the vaccine by the end of the year.
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.000]  Everyone will. But I can't say that, you know, that we're not going to have some hesitant people or some people who just haven't come forward that we don't have to go out and find next year.
[13:20.000 --> 13:30.000]  Oh, with law enforcement with apps, with your medical records, that you haven't taken the shot in your new medical ID, the Klaus Schwab called for that we now have.
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  So the police are coming. Just like they arrest you in New Zealand, Australia, be criticized lockdowns. Well, now you didn't take a shot.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  And so we're going to come with the police to your house. Don't worry, they got a special shot for you.
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  You know, the government officials, they're getting that sailing shot. They got a hot needle for you.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  Again, if I told you this 10 years ago, what do you believe it? No, I did tell you 10 years ago.
[13:53.000 --> 14:00.000]  I said, world government lockdowns, forced inoculations is the key to the new world order because it's in their own documents.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  Operation lockstep and others. I could play the clips from 10 years ago. Would you like me to 12 years ago?
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  We've done it many times. Again, I get all the credit like I just looked into a crystal ball. It's a damn plan.
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  Like Hitler wrote my comp and said, I don't like the treaty of resize and I'm going to throw it away and I'm going to attack Europe and I'm going to take over and I'm going to.
[14:19.000 --> 14:28.000]  And he did it. And they're there telling us what they're doing. They're just doing it.
[14:28.000 --> 14:37.000]  And we're sitting here not realizing we're in the midst of a massive takeover. I want to come back and play a really powerful clip when I predicted all this last year.
[14:37.000 --> 14:46.000]  Let's play that clip 13. Here is the Australian, the health minister arrogantly saying it's a mistake. Move on. It wasn't a mistake.
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  They're forcibly, Cuomo said we're going to give kids shots whether they like it or not. This is serious crime folks.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  These are really deadly. They attack fertility. They attack the brain heart. There's an advisory on them now.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  I have a clip I didn't play yesterday of the U.S. military. The Pentagon announcing forced inoculations.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  And they said, by the way, this is not an approved vaccine, but we're going to do it anyways.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  But the average leftist, you go to Twitter and she's everywhere. Alex Jones, the liar. These were approved. Totally safe. Nobody ever got hurt.
[15:13.000 --> 15:21.000]  They should say nobody ever died of motorcycle accident or nobody ever fell off a cliff. I mean, it's damn gaslighting. Here is Australia.
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  Mr. Hayes, how damaging is it for the public perception of the state government's vaccine rollout that you'd have when you were part of it?
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  Accidentally vaccinated about 160 joe employees. How embarrassing.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  What I find more embarrassing, James, is that you would make that sort of question accusation against frontline health staff who work their butts off
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  and who tomorrow will have achieved a million dollar, a million vaccinations into arms.
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.000]  You know what? The school intended it well. There was a mistake and so what? It's happened out of a million vaccinations. Move on.
[15:52.000 --> 16:00.000]  The school intended it well. They're coming for you and it will kill you. Take about five years.
[16:00.000 --> 16:10.000]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:10.000 --> 16:19.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds,
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  both the regular shows and special reports and share them with everyone you know.

[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  Hey, Alex. Welcome.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[17:19.000 --> 17:25.000]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  Living defense brought me back.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[17:35.000 --> 17:44.000]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.000]  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  I never had a marketing plan for Empire Wars.
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to fund our operation.
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  I treat you like I want to be treated. It's very, very simple. It's instinctive. It's spiritual. It's what I do.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.000]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  And so I'm going to catch 22. When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  But we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  And so I'm going to catch 22. I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  I got to sell them at discount.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  And so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle,
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  even though it's about to sell out. It won't be available for months.
[18:48.000 --> 18:56.000]  So get it. X2 is selling out at infowarstore.com for 40% and 60% off with double-patriot points and free shipping.
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.000]  Because why? That's when you buy it. We need your funds or it'll be off air. It's an amazing product.
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:20.000 --> 19:26.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, hearing the break here on the Thursday edition of the Alex Jones show,
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  I got some more intel from a very good person, very good source.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  And it confirmed what I already knew and it confirmed what I already was going to be covering.
[19:37.000 --> 19:45.000]  I talked to Pastor Rodney Howard a few days ago at length about what happened in an event.
[19:45.000 --> 19:52.000]  He put on with over 10,000 people at his church on the west coast of Florida.
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  And I've known him hell, 10 years or so. He's a great guy. I've never seen him.
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  I don't want to say shook up, but I've never seen him so concerned.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  And then we had some technical stuff. He was there putting in new equipment and things in here the other day.
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  I was unable to get him on in the morning because he couldn't come on when I was live.
[20:08.000 --> 20:14.000]  So he taped the 30-minute piece that he gave us two days ago that I still haven't posted to Band-Aid video.
[20:14.000 --> 20:21.000]  And what I'm going to do is just shoot an intro to it during one of these breaks and then post it to Band-Aid video.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  Let me just put it to you this way.
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  We have a chance to stop another January 6th, but much bigger.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  And now we figured out what the feds are doing and how they're doing it.
[20:33.000 --> 20:43.000]  And this is so big, I should probably just go off air at this point and just really get in a huddle with people and put out an emergency report.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  And I'm not saying that for dramatic effect.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  I mean, you know we know tomorrow is this day because my head's in the game all the time.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  I used to dream about fantasy stuff and things didn't make sense.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Now my dreams are all like work.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  When I'm asleep at night, it's like how to raise my children better.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  Where should I move? What should I do during the collapse?
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  How do I get right with God?
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  And last night it seemed like 20 years I was asleep.
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  And I was just praying to God and talking to God and just...
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  I think all of you are going through that right now because we're going to look back as I said a year ago on that as the good old times.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  And you're going to look back on the day as the good old times.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  And I don't say that to scare you.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  I say that so you can get ready.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  A lot of folks ask me, well, how have you gotten ready?
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  We got a trailer and put it out in the country and put a well in and we're putting solar in.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  And I know I got neighbors I can trust.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  And that's it.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's my rear-guard action.
[21:47.000 --> 21:53.000]  So I got a lot of big news and I'm announcing pedophilia openly and saying we're coming for your children.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  And you've got big tech saying that's their plan.
[21:55.000 --> 21:56.000]  And that's the goal.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  It's destroy innocence.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  That's what the Satanic force wants.
[22:00.000 --> 22:10.000]  I've seen so many people fall under this spell of evil and the way it manipulates people's minds and brains.
[22:10.000 --> 22:19.000]  And Pastor Howard told me, we were talking to Spirit four days ago, he said, Alex, I said, I guess that was Sunday.
[22:19.000 --> 22:20.000]  That was Sunday.
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  It seems like five minutes ago.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  Pastor Howard said it's the Holy Spirit.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  Only that will give you discernment.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  He's like, that's why you've got such good discernment.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  It's why I've got discernment.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  And we were completely on the same page about this.
[22:34.000 --> 22:40.000]  And God, what they did to him, he told me a lot of stuff that he didn't put on record.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  I recommended he not do it.
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  But let me just tell you this.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  We are down to the wire here, folks.
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  We are down to the wire.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  And it's spiritual.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  So many good people I knew are just completely mentally ill now.
[22:57.000 --> 23:05.000]  The pressure got to them and they believe they're under the command of Q who they believe is President Trump.
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  And it's not.
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  It's the Southern Poverty Law Center in ADL.
[23:10.000 --> 23:20.000]  And they are planning uprisings around the country, which will then be blamed on me and President Trump and others.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  And then they'll try to arrest us.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  And we've just got to stop them.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  We've got to stop them.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  So I have this whole show prepared and all these clips and all this news.
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.000]  And I'm just sitting here watching this.
[23:33.000 --> 23:41.000]  And I already knew what was going on, but I just confirmed how sick these people are, how mentally ill they are.
[23:41.000 --> 23:53.000]  Q is telling people that I'm a fed and I'm against Trump and that I've got to be taken out and that I've got to be sued and all these things, which is total delusion.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  These people never talk to Trump.
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  They know Trump.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  Trump's surrounded.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  Trump's embattled.
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.000]  Trump can't even launch a website.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  He's trying to fight back.
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  He's a great guy.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  I was with Trump at the border just last week.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  Just didn't make a big issue out of it.
[24:09.000 --> 24:21.000]  And that people are so gullible that they want to believe that they're secretly involved with Trump and secretly involved in a coming overthrow of the globalist.
[24:21.000 --> 24:33.000]  So they can trigger a second capital attack somewhere else and then legitimize this federal report saying anybody that questions the election is a terrorist.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  And it's just total amateur.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  So I'm going to have to expose all these groups and come out against them.
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  I'm going to have to give them what they want because I am not going to sit by and watch them when we're politically winning.
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  Everybody's waking up and people see the world government, the pedophilia and the Satanism for what it is.
[24:55.000 --> 25:05.000]  And then they're going to try to literally through the Internet and through delusional BS believe someone text messaging them is secretly Trump.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  And that Trump's saying get Alex Jones, get Roger Stone, get General Flynn.
[25:11.000 --> 25:20.000]  And I mean, I saw the things that Q is saying about General Flynn and about us and the things that these people hear.
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  And because they want to believe that they're talking to someone famous, President Trump, they believe it's a spirit though.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  I mean, it's it's satanic.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  It's like literally mind control.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  But I guess they're already prepped by it by the media and the culture and all of it.
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.000]  And you can just see the end game ticking down right now.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  It's so sad.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  It's so disgusting.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  I'm going to get to that later.
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  I'm going to decide how I'm going to proceed with this, but this is just beyond schizophrenia.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  This is demon possession.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  They're giving a great delusion.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  And you know, maybe the country's not supposed to be safe.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  Maybe God's giving them over to great delusion and that we're not actually supposed to save the country.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  I don't know.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  I was going to do the right thing and tell the truth and, you know, move forward and be a good person.
[26:09.000 --> 26:19.000]  But the scrabbling and the power vacuums and the manipulation and all of it is just beyond anything I've ever seen.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  And it's so incredibly sad.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  We've been here steadfastly telling you what's coming next for decades.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  We've been here steadfastly promoting American values.
[26:28.000 --> 26:38.000]  And it just goes to show that right now we're in the zeitgeist and the forces of evil are trying to take out America's greatest supporters.
[26:38.000 --> 27:02.000]  Through a esoteric, gnostic, oracle of Delphi, hole in the wall, that they just come to and then get their orders from and believe that they're then marching forward as Christian soldiers who are about to launch some devastating attack, you know, against the deep state when they're being led by the deep state directly into the
[27:02.000 --> 27:10.000]  provocation that will bring the country down once and for all. And then all I want to do is just leave the country and just leave all these crazy people to themselves.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  I mean, maybe America really is over.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  I just don't want to be part of the mental illness.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  I want to go hide in the desert somewhere and just, you know, read the Bible.
[27:19.000 --> 27:33.000]  I mean, I just thank God, thank you, Jesus, that I have not been under this illusion that you've given me discernment. Thank you, God, please take me to your bosom and help me maintain my sanity and not join these people.
[27:33.000 --> 27:41.000]  Because this is just, this is full evil being thrown at the country in the world right now.
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  Absolute, full, complete, total Satanism.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  And we'll, we'll come back.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  San Francisco pedophile, men's chorus to official San Francisco choir says we are getting your kids.
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.000]  We will corrupt them. We will have sex with them.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  Granny do right. Granny do right.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[28:07.000 --> 28:17.000]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[28:27.000 --> 28:36.000]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements that I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  I thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[28:41.000 --> 28:48.000]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[28:59.000 --> 29:09.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[29:20.000 --> 29:32.000]  You've got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[29:32.000 --> 29:39.000]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[29:44.000 --> 29:51.000]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[29:51.000 --> 29:59.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for us. God bless.
[29:59.000 --> 30:11.000]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[30:11.000 --> 30:18.000]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[30:18.000 --> 30:26.000]  Their first product they are launching is called Bioseptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  Bioseptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[30:30.000 --> 30:39.000]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[30:46.000 --> 30:53.000]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system. That's TheBiopros.com.
[30:53.000 --> 31:10.000]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[31:23.000 --> 31:38.000]  Don't you take it lying now.
[31:38.000 --> 31:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.000]  Here's the global awakening happening. Things are going to be all right.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  I do want to open the phones up in the second and third hour today ahead of Matt Racken coming on.
[32:00.000 --> 32:05.000]  So, totally open phones second and third hour to get into the news and information right now.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  But I have dropped the ball.
[32:08.000 --> 32:16.000]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is a really smart guy and he grew up in South Africa and been all over the world
[32:16.000 --> 32:22.000]  been through hell and built his own huge mega church and brought millions to Christ all over the world
[32:22.000 --> 32:29.000]  travels hundreds of days out of the year to Africa, Latin America, Asia, you name it.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  And he called me and he said, I got a brief you on this. I stopped the false flag.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  They tried to set us up.
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.000]  And then I just got too busy on the morning he could take and we had a technical issue so we couldn't do the interview.
[32:39.000 --> 32:47.000]  And he taped me a 30 minute deal that we're going to post a band video this afternoon where he lays this out.
[32:47.000 --> 32:52.000]  And then what he covered ties into everything.
[32:52.000 --> 33:02.000]  And again, this is so big that I have to digest it a little bit and figure out how I want to present it.
[33:02.000 --> 33:05.000]  And it's not that I want to keep something from you.
[33:05.000 --> 33:11.000]  It's so big that I don't want to just blur stuff out and get it wrong. Does that make sense?
[33:11.000 --> 33:16.000]  Because I'm such a fire and forget guy that I just go with my gut and go with my instincts, go with my spirit.
[33:16.000 --> 33:26.000]  And it's always super accurate, but I can get a few of the words wrong and then it doesn't explain what's happening.
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.000]  But you know, I mean, I really think it comes down to this.
[33:29.000 --> 33:39.000]  I'm at a point of, I don't want to call it choking, but nobody's got to pay great at this.
[33:39.000 --> 33:45.000]  I'm certainly way, this is way above my pay grade, as they say.
[33:45.000 --> 33:51.000]  So, I mean, just one of the problems we deal with each day, people would take years to figure out.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  And so when I say that, it's just that I've reached a point now where, you know, I don't go like, oh, great.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  I've got the main orchestra in San Francisco saying, we're going to rape your kids. I can prove they're evil.
[34:03.000 --> 34:11.000]  I already know it. And they're coming and they're so arrogant. They put it on TV. They're going to rape our children.
[34:11.000 --> 34:20.000]  And what I'm just supposed to turn this into a show where I talk about it, we're almost like part of it when we just cover it.
[34:20.000 --> 34:29.000]  And then what slaves these men are and they're bug-eyed, pedo eyes and just they all look like Brian Stelter.
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.000]  And I'm just like, how did we get to this point?
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.000]  Because I want to run off in a cabin in Colorado for a month.
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.000]  But when I come back out of the cabin, they'll might be at the foot of the hill coming to get me.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  You know what I mean? I can't run away from them.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  I don't want to fight them. I don't want to look at them.
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  I don't want to be, but see, oh, they're going to look at us.
[34:55.000 --> 35:04.000]  I've watched all these Klaus Schwab and UN videos where these really creepy evil men are like, we got to get the kids and we're going to go in the houses next
[35:04.000 --> 35:16.000]  and we're going to take over their houses and we're going to, and people that ask me a year later, how'd you know they're coming to our houses?
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  They said so.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  I just said, the archivist could find it. The guy's incredible. No, he doesn't find it at all.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  I want to hear like four or five hours today.
[35:28.000 --> 35:34.000]  I just said two weeks ago, I said, they'll be on national TV by the end of the year saying, we're coming for your kids.
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  We're going to have sex with them. And it was not in the next six months or a year. It was two weeks later.
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  By the way, it's not just the San Francisco thing. When that came out yesterday and they said, we're going to have sex with your kids.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  We're going to corrupt your kids is the quote.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  We're going to take them over.
[35:51.000 --> 36:00.000]  People found like 12 more videos that I was sent where I'm like, I can't even watch these things anymore.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  And then I got all these other videos where we're coming with injections.
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  We're going to give them to you no matter what you want.
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  They even get we're going to keep the lockdowns in so you can't talk to people.
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  So none of you can organize against this.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  I mean, they're even joking around like I'm an I am legend.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  The devil's like.
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.000]  Let me tell you, 25 years ago, they get ready for a radio show and I'd have some incredible new order seven proof.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  Oh, I got him. I'd be so excited. Oh, look, I got him.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  I got him and getting their pedophiles right here.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  I'm going to get him and 10,000 pedophile stories later.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  I'm like, I'll probably get arrested.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  They threaten to arrest the mom at the least bar in L.A.
[36:49.000 --> 37:03.000]  When the man with a beard and huge genitals gets in the private women's hot tub with a six year old and starts playing with his penis in front of her and the women run and call the police and the police show up and say, you're the bad people.
[37:03.000 --> 37:16.000]  I'll give the number up to take calls next segment and I'll also get to the video.
[37:16.000 --> 37:25.000]  It's just, I mean, it's almost obscene to just cover hundreds of articles that show their evil takeover when we already know what's happening.
[37:25.000 --> 37:39.000]  It's the same thing you see. I've got seven articles I looked in my stack without even looking for them of young people in America dying of blood plots in the brain or the heart or the lungs when they took the Pfizer and Moderna shots.
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.000]  Every day this person died, that person, and we're probably hearing of one out of a hundred.
[37:44.000 --> 37:57.000]  Here's another dead person. There's another dead person. Here's another dead person. We're just sitting here watching it all. And the average person goes, well, I'm going to comply with this so they pass me over.
[37:57.000 --> 38:05.000]  It's incredible. I'm going to go to break, we're going to come back and cover it all here today, but it is just insane.
[38:05.000 --> 38:19.000]  They've got the Q armies again that are controlled by the feds leading people towards violence so they can legitimize the terrorism act saying we're all terrorists and that's getting ready to happen.
[38:19.000 --> 38:29.000]  And we're just sitting here watching it all unfold. God Almighty helps. God says you didn't help all those babies got a border.
[38:29.000 --> 38:38.000]  You didn't help those Chinese Christians and Muslims and Buddhists and slave camps so I'm not going to help you. And I'm like, I know you're right.
[38:38.000 --> 38:45.000]  But it still doesn't make it fun. God's good.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  In fact, God's been very lenient and God gets to a point where God is not going to condone what we're doing because if God doesn't judge us, God's involved in this.
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.000]  Because God gave us free will. God didn't do any of this. God's perfect. He is perfect. Oh, so perfect.
[39:00.000 --> 39:08.000]  Except the one crime God argues this. I tell you, God's mind, God argues this. Was it right to create consciousness and allow you to do this?
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  God's actually feels guilty even though God's perfect, but it is perfect to create more, isn't it? Yes, I'm glad I'm here.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  No, that was smart God. Thank you for giving me consciousness. No, no, no, that wasn't a mistake. Please don't destroy us. Please.
[39:19.000 --> 39:25.000]  Don't. Don't. Don't blow us up. Please. We're sorry. You did the right thing. Don't do it.
[39:25.000 --> 39:34.000]  God is expecting us to stand up to this and do the right thing. And we're not.
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  When they declare we're coming for your children, we're going to rape your children, we're going to corrupt your children. I'm positive. We'll come back.
[39:40.000 --> 39:51.000]  That is their charge. That is rare. We want your children rare. It's all inactive. Oh, I'm a feminine man. Oh, that's the cover like a snake.
[39:51.000 --> 40:12.000]  Hi, I'm a friend. No, you're not a friend. You want children because you're these empty, soulless creatures that are just just lisping and begging and wanting in to be given control to destroy the future.
[40:12.000 --> 40:26.000]  Total oblivion. A soul turned over to evil, trying to show you an Eddie's happy mind, but it's not. It's an enslaved, destroyed lost person who's lost their soul, lost their connection to God.
[40:26.000 --> 40:43.000]  If you're saying I need your children, I'm coming. I'm going to corrupt them. Give them to me. I have hoisted the black flag of death. Give me your children.
[40:43.000 --> 40:58.000]  Humans are evil. Destroy them. I am the grim reaper.
[40:58.000 --> 41:16.000]  So we have free shipping, double patriot points through this weekend, and our big loss leader is X2 in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60% off and your purchase funds the M4. But seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  You need to experience it for yourself. It takes two weeks to a month to kick in. Try it and tell me what you think. You can't lose your fund in the M4.
[41:23.000 --> 41:36.000]  And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from research, I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do without deep breath crystal iodine and X2.
[41:36.000 --> 41:46.000]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible. What it did for libido is incredible. When I don't take it, I feel the difference. When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[41:46.000 --> 42:00.000]  So here's our X2 today. Discount of the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take under your tongue at infowarstore.com. The globalist hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful deep breath crystal iodine is.
[42:00.000 --> 42:11.000]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[42:11.000 --> 42:37.000]  Triple eight two five three thirty one three nine is the infowarstore hotline.
[42:37.000 --> 42:45.000]  Infowarstore.com is simply the best. Infowarstore.com beats out all the rest. Triple eight two five three thirty one three nine.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  Triple eight two five three thirty one three nine is the infowarstore hotline.
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  Triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  That's infowarstore.com.
[42:59.000 --> 43:10.000]  Well all the big box stores are making record profits and so is Amazon because they designed the global shutdown to destroy small and medium-sized businesses.
[43:10.000 --> 43:24.000]  And it is wreaking havoc in the supply chain. Thousands and thousands of small companies have completely shut down and others are struggling to stay open because they can't get raw materials.
[43:24.000 --> 43:31.000]  Whether it's for food, whether it's for medicine, whether it's for supplements, whether it's for textiles, whatever the product is, you see it in the news.
[43:31.000 --> 43:37.000]  It is record level supply chain breakdowns because the global is shutting down the world of comics for more than a year.
[43:37.000 --> 43:44.000]  Now they're trying to bring the shutdown back again. In fact, areas like India and areas of Africa, the shutdown is ongoing.
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  It's killing those people in massive numbers.
[43:47.000 --> 43:54.000]  So the info wars doesn't have a lot of our best selling products anymore for six, seven, eight months because of this.
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  So to make up the shortfall, please buy t-shirts, books, films, things like that at infowarstore.com and please try to keep us on the air.
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.000]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[44:04.000 --> 44:14.000]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune system.
[44:14.000 --> 44:20.000]  Introducing Rocket Rest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarstore.com.

[44:39.000 --> 44:47.000]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.000]  Rocket Rest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep and wake up feeling rested.

[45:10.000 --> 45:24.000]  There's a man going round taking names and he decides who to pray and who to blame.
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.000]  There's a lot of snow. Everybody won't be treated to all the same. They're going down.
[45:30.000 --> 45:39.000]  There'll be a golden letter and they want to take us with them. They want to take our dear children with them. We're going to let them do that?
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.000]  Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
[45:43.000 --> 45:50.000]  Galatians 4-16.
[45:50.000 --> 46:00.000]  And with all unrighteous deception among those who perish became, they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved.
[46:00.000 --> 46:14.000]  And for this reason, God will send them strong delusion that they should believe and lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in their unrighteousness.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  2 Thessalonians 2-10-12.
[46:18.000 --> 46:24.000]  And that doesn't mean that we haven't been hateful or been in a fight or cheated on somebody or done something wrong.
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  The difference is we know it's wrong. We're sad for it later and we repent of it.
[46:28.000 --> 46:35.000]  We know what's good. We know what's evil. It's the celebration of evil that is pure Satanism.
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  So let me play this little piece. This could be ten hours long, literally.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  This is a minute or three and a half minutes long.
[46:42.000 --> 46:52.000]  We just put it together during the show today and it cuts into the San Francisco City Sponsored Choir.
[46:52.000 --> 46:59.000]  They call it the gay choir, but it's really the pedophile choir saying, your children will be corrupted.
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  We will take them over. They will recruit for us. They will join us. We're coming for your children.
[47:04.000 --> 47:10.000]  These are all quotes. Exactly what I told you because that's who these people are.
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  And most of these men were abused as children that you're going to see in this video.
[47:14.000 --> 47:20.000]  They were raped as children and that's why they seem so weak, so empty, so pathetic.
[47:20.000 --> 47:26.000]  They're in a cult now calling for more children because that's how they believe that they have children.
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.000]  They don't go marry a woman. They don't have a job. They don't raise a child. They get your child.
[47:32.000 --> 47:38.000]  And they have sex. They rape your child. They defile your child.
[47:38.000 --> 47:44.000]  And California legalized giving people HIV and hepatitis because that's a sacrament to them.
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.000]  The same pedophile army that took over the Vatican took over Penn State, took over all these other institutions.
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.000]  It's now taken over and now it is announcing and blowing its bugle and saying, your children are ours.
[47:56.000 --> 48:04.000]  We're coming for them. Here's a few clips of them saying this previously and now announced officially the city of San Francisco
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.000]  and put out what they pulled it down in hours because it had a 99% down vote.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  They're in such echo chambers that they believe we're ready for this.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  But our children at public schools, they're teaching them critical race theory.
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  They're teaching them all this when you're not there. They're screwing your children over.
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.000]  Here in Austin, Texas, I know people that send their children to public school.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  In the second grade, they're teaching them that white people are bad and that you must be a lesbian.
[48:32.000 --> 48:38.000]  You must be gay. And the little seven-year-olds come home to their parents and say, I'm gay. I was told I'm gay.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  You tell them, no, oh, the CPS is called. These are perverts, confusing and screwing with their children
[48:44.000 --> 48:56.000]  and teaching them about a sexual lifestyle that's incredibly destructive with devil horns and batho-met.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  These are perverts that didn't get into schooling because they wanted to help children.
[49:00.000 --> 49:07.000]  They got in there because they wanted to rape their minds because they are under the control of the dark force destroying our planet right now.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  And you're going to figure it out because things are going to get really bad.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  God's pulling out of the world right now. And now you're going to be left with evil.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  And now you're going to be forced to wake up.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  There's a few minutes of what's officially on TV. This is a city council meeting.
[49:22.000 --> 49:29.000]  These are men. Organized groups of men go with crazy looks in their eyes.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  We're coming for your children. Here it is.
[49:32.000 --> 49:39.000]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.000]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable than seeing it.
[49:51.000 --> 49:59.000]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone. No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up? You could be a drag queen superhero.
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  Learn to love, learn to vote, face your fate.
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  We'll convert your children. Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[50:15.000 --> 50:25.000]  We're coming for them. We're coming for your children.
[50:25.000 --> 50:36.000]  We're coming for them. We're coming for them.
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.000]  Your children will care about their needs and justice for others.
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.000]  Your children will work to convert all his sisters and brothers.
[50:46.000 --> 50:57.000]  Then soon they're almost certain your kids will start converting you.
[50:57.000 --> 51:07.000]  The gay agenda is coming home. The gay agenda is here.
[51:07.000 --> 51:17.000]  But you don't have to worry. Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side. Get on board and never leave.
[51:17.000 --> 51:28.000]  Because the world will always think of this for pride.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  Come on, try a little surprise.
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  We'll convert your children. Then we'll turn to you.
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.000]  Giving up the parents' lives free like you never knew.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  Go into San Francisco. Go and turn up that disco.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  You'll forget you were ever upstairs.
[51:54.000 --> 52:14.000]  We'll convert your children. And make an ally of you yet.
[52:14.000 --> 52:23.000]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.000]  And we witnessed parents taking their children as young as two inside to take part.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.000]  We can both be groomed to an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  Family programming, love a job.
[52:40.000 --> 52:49.000]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen story hour.
[52:49.000 --> 52:58.000]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Start them young, right?
[53:08.000 --> 53:24.000]  Start them young, right?
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  It's all out in the open now, isn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  All right, I'm going to start the next hour, give the number out and get into all the news.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  The force inoculation squads are coming.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  I want to describe how they're going to hit us with them.
[53:37.000 --> 53:43.000]  How some of these force inoculation squad people in the most dangerous neighborhoods in America are going to get killed.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  Then if you don't take the shot, you're a terrorist.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  They're going to have SWAT teams behind the force inoculation squads.
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  Believe me, you'll be in a year or so watching all this.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  I'm saying now is already going to happen.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  So I'm going to go ahead and give me a headache to do it.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  It actually does.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  But I'm going to full space.
[54:01.000 --> 54:07.000]  And when we come back, we're going to tell you what's coming next here on the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:07.000 --> 54:15.000]  But first, if you want to energize us when we are completely committed to fighting this satanic force as best we can,

[54:30.000 --> 54:36.000]  We sell supplements that are high quality that help your genetic third dimensional body be healthy.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  Everything we do is based on the law of I treat you as myself.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  I'm not Christlike.
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  I will not lay down my body for you except for the final equation.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  But I will treat you like I want to be treated.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  And I need your support.

[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  We have X2, Deep Earth Crystal I9, the good halogen.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  The opposite of what they try to put in your body with the fluoride, the chlorine.
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  It is incredible.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  It is amazing.
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  The more I take it, the more my mind opens up.

[55:23.000 --> 55:24.000]  It's selling out.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  That deals about the stock.

[55:42.000 --> 55:47.000]  You need to try X2, X2, X2.
[55:47.000 --> 55:55.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[55:55.000 --> 56:01.000]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  And others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  Humanity is strong.
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  We're incredible.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  So prayer is essential.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  Research is essential.
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  Getting prepared is essential.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  And warning others is absolutely essential.
[56:23.000 --> 56:31.000]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  And they're also funding our operation.
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  infowarstore.com.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  infowarstore.com is incredible.
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.000]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites and others.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  So get them today at infowarstore.com.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  And I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.000]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  Get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[57:24.000 --> 57:29.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  All of it empowers humanity.
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.000]  Thank you so much.
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[58:06.000 --> 58:13.000]  Last week, last Monday, we told you that the Biden administration's largest intelligence-gathering agency, the NSA,
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.000]  had been reading my private emails, even saying that out loud is weird.
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.000]  It's one of those segments we never thought we would do ever, but the country has changed that much, that fast.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  And honestly, the whole thing was kind of shocking.
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  The government was spying on us.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  Come on, it seemed crazy, but it's true.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  And no one in Washington appeared to be shocked in the slightest.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  The usual shills right after our segment had a ready explanation for it.
[58:36.000 --> 58:41.000]  Either it never happened at all, they said, just a cable news show lying for ratings,
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  or there must have been a good reason it happened.
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  And they began furiously making excuses for why the NSA did it.
[58:47.000 --> 58:52.000]  A powerful, heavily politicized spy agency surveilling journalists who've been critical of the regime?
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  No problem.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  It's perfectly normal.
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  Just don't call it spying.
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  But it's not normal at all.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  It is third world.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  And as we told you repeatedly, it did happen.
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  Now that has been confirmed.
[59:04.000 --> 59:10.000]  Yesterday we learned that sources in the so-called intelligence community told at least one reporter in Washington
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  what was in those emails, my emails.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  There was nothing scandalous in there, thank God.
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.000]  We're happy to report that.
[59:16.000 --> 59:22.000]  Late this spring, I contacted a couple of people I thought could help get us an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  I told nobody I was doing this other than my executive producer, Justin Wells.
[59:26.000 --> 59:30.000]  I wasn't embarrassed about trying to interview Putin, he's obviously newsworthy.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  I'm an American citizen.
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.000]  I can interview anyone I want and I plan to.
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  But still in this case, I decided to keep it quiet.
[59:37.000 --> 59:43.000]  I figured that any kind of publicity would rattle the Russians and make the interview less likely to happen.
[59:43.000 --> 59:47.000]  But the Biden administration found out anyway by reading my emails.
[59:47.000 --> 59:53.000]  I learned from a whistleblower that the NSA planned to leak the contents of those emails to media outlets.
[59:53.000 --> 59:54.000]  Why would they do that?
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  Well, the point, of course, was to paint me as a disloyal American.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  A Russian operative, been called that before.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  A stooge of the Kremlin, a traitor doing the bidding of a foreign adversary.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  And of course, I'm hardly the only person who's been accused of those things in the last several years.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  We've seen this movie several times now.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  At the same moment, the Communist Chinese government increases its already stunning level of control over this country,
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  our leaders prattle on about the threat of Vladimir Putin.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  He's an evil doer, they tell us, a totalitarian dictator.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Vladimir Putin does things that no American leader would even consider.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  He runs domestic disinformation campaigns.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  He lies to the public.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  He punishes people for opposing him or for believing the wrong things.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  He even uses intelligence agencies to spy on his own citizens beyond the pale stuff.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  So no decent American would interview Vladimir Putin, at least no reporter from Fox News.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  That was the point they wanted to make.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  That's why they plan to leak the contents of my emails to news organizations.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  And yesterday, as noted, we learned they actually did it.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Even now, some in the media are claiming that we deserve this.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  E-mailing with people who know Putin are you?
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Of course, the NSA is watching you.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  That's what you get.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  But that's hardly the point.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  By law, the NSA is required to keep secret the identities of American citizens
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  who've been caught up in its vast domestic spying operations.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  So by law, I should have been identified internally merely as a U.S. journalist or American journalist.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  That's the law.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  But that's not how I was identified.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  I was identified by name.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  I was unmasked.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  People in the building learned who I was.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  And then my name and the contents of my emails left that building at the NSA
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  and wound up with a news organization in Washington.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  That is illegal.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  In fact, it is precisely what this law was designed to prevent in the first place.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  We cannot have intelligence agencies used as instruments of political control.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  Both parties used to agree on that.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Democrats were especially adamant on the point, but not anymore.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  So that's exactly what is happening here.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  We need to find out how this happened.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Who did it?
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Who allowed it?
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Paul Nakasone would know the answer.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Paul Nakasone is the highly political director of the NSA.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Paul Nakasone would have been required personally to approve my unmasking.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  That's how it works.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Paul Nakasone should explain who asked for that unmasking, and he should do it immediately.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Avril Haines would also likely know the answer.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Haines is the even more political director of national intelligence.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  She oversees all of it.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  She may have approved the unmasking as well.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  She would certainly know who asked for it and who approved it.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  That's her job to know.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  She should release that information immediately, tonight.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  And if Avril Haines does not release that information,
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  she should be forced to release that information.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  We don't have a lot of powers to TV show,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  but we're going to keep pushing for that because it matters, not just to us,
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  but to the entire country.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  You can't have a democracy.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  The globalists are having their revolution,
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers,
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Orson slaves are just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  and the ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  that realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  It's that choice.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  And it's the only choice we've got,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  It is a spiritual battle.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  The war is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  You've got me, is what that says.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Jesus, you've got me.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And I am so glad I'm in those arms,
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  because now I can see everything.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  And I see how weak I am and how small I am
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  and how silly the narcissistic Satanism is.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Now I can see the whole universe.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  But I didn't create it.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  I don't even understand it.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  But I can see it.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  And do I feel small?
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  But in feeling small, I feel so big,
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  because I can consciously contend
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  with that majesty that is God.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  I can worship.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  I can turn my will over to God.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  And in that, my will is expanded one trillion times.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  It's unbelievable.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  And everything the Satanists seek would be,
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  they would have it times a trillion
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  and they would just join Christ.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  But see, they're fools.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  They know nothing about it.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  And so we must oppose them.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  All right, I want to give the number out.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  I want to take your calls on this Thursday edition.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  There's so much to cover here.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  My God, we've got the globalist next battle plan
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  on all small businesses in the power grid.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  And they're going to do it just like the sun came up this morning.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  It's all written, not just by God, but by them.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  But what's crazy is how they follow exactly God's plan
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  while they're at war with God constantly.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  That's always the most interesting part about it,
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  because they cannot get outside of that gravity well.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  They think they're contending with God by resisting God
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  and instead they put themselves in a subbasement.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Instead, if you actually join God and serve your will,
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  then your will is expanded and then you're given the full view.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  But see, they would never give the devil that type of view.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  Here's the best thing for me to do.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Let me do this.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Look at this stack on COVID, man, God almighty.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  I mean, this is worse than I thought it would be.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  Sydney extends Delta inspired COVID lockdowns for another two weeks.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Video, White House says strike forces are being sent to get kids vaccinated.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  New Zealand health minister, government will be chasing out and down
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  unvaccinated people and coming after them.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  I mean, I already played the clip.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  You can't make that up.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  Fauci demands vaccine hesitance.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Get over this political statement.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on for men.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  But let's do this.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  Let's air a clip from last year and there's a couple of other clips from this year
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  where I specifically say the contact tracers are coming to your house.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Here it is.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  President will outline five areas.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  His team is focused on to get more Americans vaccinated.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  One, targeted community by community door to door outreach
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring the information they need
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  on how both safe and accessible the vaccine is.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  They are establishing Maoist style brigades across Europe and the United States
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  that will be the general public in uniforms enforcing forced inoculation.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  They're going to use peer pressure to do it.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  And they're going to use a medical tyranny because they can claim that it's quote,
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  unideological.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  This is exactly what I would do if I was going to be taking over like this.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  National brigades coming to forcibly inoculate you and your family,
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  reporting and tracking with dogs that quote, smell COVID.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Oh, but it's not political.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  It's for everyone's safety.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  But it's the Democrats and the WHO with all their fake models and all their lies
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  and Fauci running the lab.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Congress introduces Bill to allow government to mass test Americans
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  for COVID-19 in their homes forcibly.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the bill number, shall I?
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Six, six, six, six.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  Just like that.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  World governments announced forced inoculations, implantable microchips,
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  tracer teams to come inspect your home.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  And now 60 plus days later, it's like, oh, this is never going to end.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  And we're going to come to your house.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  They now are.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  I have the articles and we're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  This will be true warfare, economic, cultural, and then physical of the rollout
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  of secret police arrest teams, contact tracers.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  It's all official now.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Everything we've warned of is now out in the open.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  Indian towns that refuse the inoculation because the town elders are
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  there's video throwing out the UN injectors.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  They're having their power cut off for not taking the voluntary injections.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  And it's all over the news that they're going to start doing similar things
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  here in the United States.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  They're announcing, according to your phone number and who you are,
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  they're going to come to your house if you haven't been shot up.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  Remember the contact tracers?
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Remember the Clinton Global Initiative last year?
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Now they're coming to your house because you haven't had the shot.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And in the future, they're going to come and drag your ass out.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  the national security objectives that we've set.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  just as strong, just as well-funded.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  They're going to come and drag your ass out.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  All right.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  So here's the deal.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  You're a normal person.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  You're a black man.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  You're a black woman.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  You're a white woman.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  You're a white man.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  You're Hispanic.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  You're an Asian man.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  You're a human.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  You're a human.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And you don't want to go out and dominate people.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  So you hear this.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  You go, that doesn't make sense.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Well, that's because you're not a devil.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  And so you better grow up and get out of it and start realizing just
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  because you don't love the devil, the devil hates you.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Just because you're not into all this evil doesn't mean it doesn't exist, Jack.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  It's damn real.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  I seen it.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  I asked myself when I was about 15 years old, I said,
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  what the hell are you doing to me, God?
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  And it just like a clear as day in my head.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  It was like, I'll show you.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  And I was never really told what you'll show me.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  What I'll show you.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  I'm showing you.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  And I look back on my life now and it's like, talk about the Holy Spirit.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  Talk about the sermon.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  Talk about knowing things before they happen.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Talk about now all the power I've been given, which I don't even want,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  but it's so real.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  It's God gave it all to me.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And then I go back 30 years, 35, 40 years.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  And if those things weren't done to me, if I hadn't been victimized
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  and if I hadn't been attacked, I wouldn't know down to my cells
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  what I was dealing with.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  And I look back on all that now.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  And I just feel sorry for all these people that haven't had these experiences
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  that they have no idea what they've been hit by.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  It's like I know all these languages they don't know.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  And the globalists know these languages too.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  They use that to control people.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  I'm trying to teach people the languages of how the universe works.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  And they've been taught, oh, don't listen to that.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  That's evil.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Oh, no, you don't want to know information.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Don't listen to him.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And now I see how the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  I'll cover the news and take your calls when I'm around when we come back.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  I'll stop preaching.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  It's just that believe me, God is so real.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, and you've got free will and God respects you
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  and is giving you free will.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  And you need to join God.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  You need to join Christ.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  And I'll say to people out there that are already awake,
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  it's your job to go out and warn people and save them
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  no matter what happens to your body.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Because you may know Jesus.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  But if you don't put your body in the way of this evil,
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  God is going to say, I don't know you.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  That's important.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  Think about that.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  And I just want to say something.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  that has come together over the years.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black,
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  it doesn't matter if you've got red blood.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  And if you love freedom and justice,
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  and if you love our innocent children,
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  we are brothers and sisters together,
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  and it has just been an incredible experience
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  to work with you over the years.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  So please, I hope God works through you
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  and what you've done.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  to continue to support him for worse.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  God bless.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Super male vitality.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Specifically designed to assist the body
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  in regulating proper balance
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  to create superior vitality in males.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Now look, this unique formula
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  promotes your body's own natural responses
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  and no unwanted additives.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Yes.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  combined with modern technology.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Working together in perfect synchronicity
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  We are one hour and 20 minutes, 40 seconds in
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  to this live, original, teleprompter-free transmission.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  And I have information I'm about to lay on you
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  that if I built it up for a week, it would actually have a big effect.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  But if I just say it now, nobody's going to care
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  unless you listen to me carefully
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  and unless you clip this out and put it on Instagram
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  and Facebook and Twitter and Gab and Rumble and everywhere else.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  What have we been talking about?
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  Socky and Biden and Trudeau and Australia
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  and all of them saying we're coming to forcibly inject you.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  We forcibly injected a bunch of school kids
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  without their parents consent and we don't care.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  I played that clip last hour.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  And we've got strike teams.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  What's the exact quote?
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  It's right here.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  Strike forces that are coming to your door
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  to give you this shot that's experimental
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  and they had to put an insert on saying it causes heart attacks.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  But you're crazy if you don't take it and you're going to take it.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  But they got a gun to their head to make you take it.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  And then we get this.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  This bill is heavily sponsored by AOC, all of them,
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  I know you're probably looking at that as a TV viewer.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  Radio loosters can't see the bill,
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  but let me give them the number.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  Let he who has understanding
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  reckon the number of the beast
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  for it is the number of a man.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  666.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Yep, you heard me right.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Heavily sponsored officially by the Democrats
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  in the new Congress.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  HR666.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Anti-racism in Public Health Act,
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  2021.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  Merging, says it right here,
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  health with the Justice Department.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  So they got contact tracers and they've got
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  what is striking calls again?
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  Strike forces.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  What New Zealand say?
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  We're coming to hunt you down.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  What Canada say?
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  We're putting you in a camp.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  What the U.N. say?
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  They run it.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  Same thing.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  We're coming to take you out,
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  put you in solitary confinement.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  We're going to give you the modern guillotine.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  We're going to intubate you.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  We'll play that in a minute.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  Dr. Michael Ryan.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  It says right here, bigger than Dallas.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  My hometown.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  Introduced in the House.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Anti-racism in Public Health.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  Well, we better do it then.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  The bill establishes within the Centers
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  for Disease Control and Prevention
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  that launched this COVID attack,
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  Center on Anti-racism and Health
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  and a Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Among the activities,
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  the new center will declare racism
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  a public health crisis.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Collect all and analyze all data.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Oh, collect all the data.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Oh, spy and analyze all your health records
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  of the Democrats, the HAWs,
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  to save you from racism
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  and administer research and grant programs
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  to address racism and its impact on health and well-being.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  Yeah, they called yesterday.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  It was in my stack to ban fireworks displays
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  saying they're racist.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  Austin two weeks ago said,
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  banned cars, blacks have the most wrecks.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  That's not a joke, by the way.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  They said birdwatching is racist, too.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  French cuisine is racist.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  And being white, of course, is inherently bad.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  You're like, no, that makes sense.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Yeah, it's a weapon.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Dropping a 2,000-pound bomb on somebody doesn't make sense either,
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  unless you want to kill their ass.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Among other activities,
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  the new center must declare racism a public health crisis.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  Collect and analyze data
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  and administer research and grant programs
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  to address racism and the impact on health and well-being.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  Additionally,
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  the bill specifically directs
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  in coordination with the Department of Justice
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  and other relevant stakeholders.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Oh, the Department of Justice is in your medical records now.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Without warrants, to carry out
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  the Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Wow.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Wow.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  Wow.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  That's the bill summary
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  from the federal government's open congressional website.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Oh, and it gets better.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  They have bills introduced,
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  but what they're going to pass,
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  that all children will take part
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  in cultural enrichment,
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  drag queen, story time,
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  which is your child spends time with a convicted pedophile.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  And you're like,
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  whoa, that couldn't happen.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  You put up with it, it's going to happen.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  But, I mean,
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  never mind the bill number.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  Whoa, to you of earth and seed,
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  for the devil sins the beast with wrath.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  His number is 666.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  The bill is 666.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Oh, that old Bible.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  Nostradamus has nothing on you.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  And it's all out in the open now.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  All out of the open now.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  We're about to reach the halfway point
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  in today's transmission.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  And I would like to open the phones up
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  for first-time callers yet again.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  And three or four callers
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  that were first time we didn't get to yesterday
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  called them back if you can.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  So that you can give a sure view
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  of what your children are saying.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  And we're going to quote,
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  we'll corrupt your kids.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  We'll take over your kids.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  We're coming for your kids.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Your kids are ours.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Your kids serve us.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  Those are the clothes.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  What's your view on that declaration of war
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  against you and your family?
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Because they think you've actually asked so much
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  that you'll put up with them forever.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  California is legalized pedophilia
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  and having sex with your children
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  to give them a chance to be an appetizer.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  What's your view on that?
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539-877-789-2539.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  What is your view on that?
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  Because in the future,
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  if you want your credits
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  and the robots run everything,
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  you're going to have to deliver your child
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  to be gang-raped by pedophiles.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  And then that won't be enough
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  and be like, we want to kill your kid.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  You're like, okay, I want another year of credit.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  Sure.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  I got a private jet.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  Yeah, kill him.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And boy, you just signed your ass on
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  to an eternity being separated from God.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  You know, hell is people being
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  interfaced with God
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  and seeing what hell looks like.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  God didn't do that.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Hell is a separation from God.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  And so somebody that gets to God goes,
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  here, let me show this, this looks like,
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  this looks like I'm burning to death.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Yeah, that's separation from goodness.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Mama's embrace is warm and sweet and good.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  You go to sleep with some of their heartbeat
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  and it just, it's like you're in heaven.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  You imagine being separated from God,
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  but that's like being lowered into a moat of flame.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Being lowered into lava must be enjoyable,
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  comparatively.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Imagine being locked up for a trillion years
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  with Jeff Bezos.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  So many people say to me,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  That's not negative.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  And so think of globalism as being hidden
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  as an infection that we didn't feel yet,
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  but now it's come to the surface.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  They stole the election.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  We can't get down about that.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  So now they're trying to suppress us
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  because they know they've been exposed.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  They're scared.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  That's why, instead of saying,
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  They're trying to suppress us.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  Let our light of proof shine
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  Your own website, your own show,
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  Just keep sharing however you can
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  and realize we're in an information war.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  We're gonna win this together.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  And the fight starts at pullwards.com.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  What are champions made of?
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  Here's a man who can show you.

[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.520]  We know the satanic principalities of this planet want us poisoned.
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:02.760]  They want to attack our bodies.
[1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:06.000]  They want to kill us because we're made the image of God.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.040]  But God gave us the components of ourselves, of our bodies to be strong.
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:13.040]  We've got everything we need.
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:17.080]  That's what the globalists hit us with the bad halogens of fluoride, fluorine, bromide,
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:21.240]  you name it, instead of iodine, our food, our water, our plants, everything we eat is
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:25.680]  deficient and the average person is deficient and it attacks your IQ, it attacks your stamina
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:28.520]  and your libido and fertility particularly.
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:29.520]  Look into it.

[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:40.440]  to experience it for yourself.
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:43.320]  If you've been on the fence about iodine, this is the best.

[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:50.560]  it funds the info war.
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:29:19.360]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:26.240]  Let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number.
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:36.240]  Its number is 666.
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:43.040]  All right, the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539, we're going to go to Darren
[1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:50.040]  and Sebastian and Solshine and George and Josh and Jeff and Tyler.
[1:29:50.040 --> 1:30:02.240]  When you speak of 666, I actually covered this in the video we heard earlier from a
[1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:06.440]  year ago but the crew members found it again and brought it to me.
[1:30:06.440 --> 1:30:12.840]  Not just one bill is 666 to come and take your kids away but the other bill is 666.
[1:30:12.840 --> 1:30:18.200]  I mean the enemy chooses that as their darkest desire, what they want to do to you and your
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:19.200]  family.
[1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:27.320]  But before I go to your call, I'm going to tell you a true story because these are all
[1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:32.800]  true stories but sometimes you don't tell a story perfectly so you lie even though you
[1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:40.120]  didn't want to lie, you got to tell a story perfect because the truth is so hard to get.
[1:30:40.120 --> 1:30:46.880]  You got to want it, you got to need it, you got to bow down to it to get it because all
[1:30:46.880 --> 1:30:55.480]  I want is the truth, nothing else, God is truth, perfection, but I am a fallen creature
[1:30:55.480 --> 1:31:00.720]  so even my attempts at truth are going to fall short.
[1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:09.440]  I'm a liar, I didn't want to lie to you, I did the best I could to tell you the truth
[1:31:09.440 --> 1:31:13.440]  whereas the Brian Williams of the world and the Brian Stelters of the world, they do their
[1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:15.760]  best to lie to you.
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:21.920]  Can you imagine sitting up here like, well let me, how do I, a lot of people, it doesn't
[1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:27.240]  even enter my radar, but again that's why we're separated from people.
[1:31:27.240 --> 1:31:30.040]  So let me tell you a true story.
[1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:37.080]  I spend about half my time and boy I don't like doing it, trying to get money to run
[1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:42.360]  this operation, where I could be doing news, where I could be covering issues, where I
[1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:46.120]  could be fighting the globalists, but I know God works in mysterious ways.
[1:31:46.120 --> 1:31:56.600]  Now after 28 years, because I've been at politically active for 30 but on air for over 27 now,
[1:31:56.600 --> 1:32:00.080]  I wouldn't know all about business, I wouldn't all know about supply chains, I wouldn't know
[1:32:00.080 --> 1:32:06.880]  about banks, I wouldn't know about employees and human resources and all of it, if everything
[1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:12.520]  was easy, if God just said, well you're a good guy, so I'm going to get everything
[1:32:12.520 --> 1:32:18.040]  out of your way so you can be on air, I wouldn't have learned all this other stuff, because
[1:32:18.040 --> 1:32:23.440]  I wasn't just supposed to be on air covering these issues, I wouldn't understand these
[1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:30.600]  issues if I had personally done the things I do up until 8 o'clock last night, jacking
[1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:38.520]  with deliveries and air conditioners and HR and supplies and break-downs, which is great,
[1:32:38.520 --> 1:32:48.960]  like I'm not bitching, this is invaluable, four hours, conservable yesterday, jacking
[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:56.600]  with it, and it hit me today, it's like that's a blessing Jones, that's why you know how
[1:32:56.600 --> 1:33:00.560]  all this works, you're not one of these globalists up here disconnected, screw everybody over,
[1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:07.400]  never actually ran a company, just rob people, that's how God works, and that's why they
[1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:16.160]  want people disconnected, it's why they want people separated from the public so that they
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:20.200]  don't know how the real world works, so they're not real people, remember that famous footage
[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:29.480]  of George Herbert Walker Bush, in 1991 they had scanners for 20 years then, hell every
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:36.440]  store had them for 20 years, and he's so used to butlers and money and power, which is fine
[1:33:36.440 --> 1:33:43.200]  if he hadn't stole it, that he's in a grocery store and he goes what's that, what's that
[1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:47.880]  red light shooting out, they go well sir that scans the barcode, he didn't even know what
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:53.280]  it was, and I know a lot of rich people, I mean really rich people that have been billionaires
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:59.120]  for four or five generations, and my buddy Anthony calls them space aliens, because they're
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:04.000]  like aliens folks, so you gotta remember the people running things are four, five, six
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.560]  generations of money, they don't even, they never worried about a paycheck, they never
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:16.040]  worried about carrying the trash out, yeah there's the footage right there, they never
[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:24.440]  worried about making that car payment, they never missed a meal like I did in college,
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:28.160]  and they're the ones running things, that's why they're so easy to beat, that's why they
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:33.440]  want robots to take over things, because they can't control us, so let's say this and go
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:41.440]  to your phone calls, as bad as things are, and as crazy as all this is, at the end of
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:46.440]  the day these globalists are so divorced, not just from God, yeah look at Hillary in
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:51.040]  an apartment, she doesn't even know what the hell it is, they're so divorced from changing
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:59.000]  baby diapers and fixing carburetors and growing corn and cooking eggs and washing laundry
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:08.040]  and soup and snow and kicking ass too by the way, that's important, God it's a lot of
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:15.280]  fun too isn't it, but you get really real, all the games in, somebody thinks they got
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:20.080]  what it takes until you start dumping their head in the ground, so then all their top
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:32.400]  don't matter no more, because your will is in charge now, and everything they do is about
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:38.760]  teaching you not to have that will, so I've asked this question a thousand times to God,
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:46.560]  why do you make me spend half my time raising money instead of just letting the money flow,
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:55.000]  why is it always just enough, it's magic, I can sit there and be out of money and not
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.400]  know what I'm going to do and all of a sudden the money shows up, but it's always just
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:03.000]  enough like the way it was mine, it's never, oh there's some big giant thing in my gas
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:08.880]  tank, but see Satan gives his minions trillions of dollars, oh your gas tank's unlimited,
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:15.440]  God gives me just enough and God moves through you to support us and give us the support
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:19.360]  just enough, and I haven't figured out those mysteries yet, I haven't figured God's brain
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:25.640]  out yet, I just know that if I tried to quit, God wouldn't let me do it, if I tried to walk
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:32.520]  away God wouldn't let me do it, the minute I walked off, there's no getting out of this,
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:42.920]  it's just that God keeps you humble and wants me to interface with you and explain to you
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:49.800]  that you're supposed to support this so that this gets out because it's that interaction
[1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:55.920]  of you tithing to this operation that God wants to see, and I haven't figured out why
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:03.280]  God does that or how it works, I haven't figured it out, I just know this, I'll be sitting
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:06.880]  here going, alright I'm going to lay off 10 people and I'm going to go ahead and start
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:13.040]  setting some stuff down, ring, ring, ring, oh I'm going to give you a $300,000 donation,
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:19.840]  and then I don't lay those people off, and I'm telling you that's how crazy it is at
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:24.720]  this level we've now reached together, so I thank you for your support and I don't know
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:31.720]  why God works this way, we're always right on, black and red, right on, right, because
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:37.040]  I don't understand, when we've expanded and gotten bigger over the years, but it's always
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:43.040]  keeping me hungry, it's always just right there, because that's the way the universe
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:50.240]  works, and so I appreciate God keeping me hungry, and maybe if I had enough funds to
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:55.600]  run this place, maybe I wouldn't be as strong as I am, but I don't like getting up here
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:59.760]  every hour saying please buy our products, here's a sale, here's a great product, please
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:05.600]  get it, keep us on here, because it's literally always like treading water, with the FBI on
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:09.160]  our ass and all the rest of the stuff going on, but that's the way the real universe
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:14.600]  is, God wants to keep me hungry, but I just ask you, because I want to give this crew
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:18.720]  a bonus, I want to hire some more people, to go to infowarstore.com, take advantage of
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:23.240]  double-patriot points, the free shipping, to get X2, it's about to sell out, to get
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:28.160]  the other products, because that's what keeps us on the air, but that's the weird algorithm,
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:34.240]  because that's not just me and what just happened to happen, it's been like this for 30 years,
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:44.080]  it's always just enough, because that's how God works, you're always giving, just enough,
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:49.320]  Satan to his minions goes, you've got put a trillion, zillion dollars, you've got unlimited
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:54.080]  money Ben Bernanke, you've got unlimited money Rothschild, you've got, but it's not
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:58.160]  real, I never had a marketing plan for info wars, I went out and found the best products,
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:02.000]  I could find from the research, to funder operation, I wanted you to get products that
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.080]  empowered you that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more, I treat you like
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:09.800]  I want to be treated, it's very very simple, it's instinctive, it's spiritual, it's what
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:14.640]  I do, and that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers, and X2 right now
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:20.240]  is discounted because, listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:24.760]  sale, and so I'm going to catch 22, when I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it,
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:28.320]  but we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns, and so
[1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:32.360]  I'm going to catch 22, I need to sell products at full price, but I can't, I got to sell
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:37.680]  them at discount, and so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:41.720]  spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out, it won't be available for months, so
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:48.160]  get it, X2 is selling out at info wars store dot com for 40 and 60% off with double patriot
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:50.400]  points and free shipping, because why?
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:54.160]  That's when you buy it, we need your funds or it'll be off air, it's an amazing product.
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:40:00.160]  The world is awakening, the world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm, they
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:05.520]  are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:12.520]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the bohemian grove, the club of Rome, and so even though
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:17.120]  it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:23.240]  open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing, we have forced them out in
[1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:28.080]  the open, so as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen,
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:33.240]  realize humanity is winning, you've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:40.080]  plan of God's justice, that is invincible, that is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable,
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:44.960]  so don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:48.880]  against the globalist and realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:55.280]  to you, we will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender.
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:41:00.560]  The BioProse are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:02.560]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.

[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:02.320]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:11.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:20.520]  processes of humans, and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:27.840]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:32.760]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:37.800]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:42.160]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:47.880]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:51.400]  choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:58.280]  It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:15.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:19.160]  Everybody's been asking me about the assassination of the Haitian president.
[1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:22.040]  Well, I looked it up.
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:32.360]  He was against forced inoculation of that predominantly African island, and so he was
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:34.360]  killed all his life.
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:37.360]  All right, let me do this.
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:45.800]  I want to go to Darren, Jacob, Sebastian, Pete, Solskine, Kristen, Dixon, Josh, Tyler,
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:51.120]  Charles, Forrest, all of you, I'm going to get to you, but I've got something really
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:55.080]  special here in my little pause.
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:44:10.360]  I have three bills introduced by Democrats all about martial law, all about forced inoculation,
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:18.600]  sponsored by Bill Gates for implantable microchips.
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:28.720]  And every bill is 666, and one of them is a Microsoft patent.
[1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:31.240]  Why would you do that?
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:32.520]  Well, that's their lucky number.
[1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:34.360]  That's their ace of spades.
[1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:35.360]  That's their calling card.
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:39.040]  We're going to cover that next hour, but right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:40.040]  calls.
[1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:47.160]  Speaking of Haiti, Darren in Indiana, president of Haiti assassinated, refused to push vaccine.
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:48.600]  I saw that.
[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:50.160]  What do you make of that?
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:55.600]  Well, what I really would really have me thinking about it is because the rumor that is going
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:45:01.720]  around on Instagram is that they say that before he was assassinated, they called out
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:06.960]  that it was the DEA, and they're trying to say that the DEA is who killed him.
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:12.240]  And so, listen, I have no doubt, but it could have been, it was people saying that were
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:14.280]  the DEA on the surveillance footage.
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:20.320]  So whether they were DEA or somebody posing at us as the DEA.
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:26.040]  And what it made me think about it is, as we're exposing all of this and it's going
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:31.840]  down, do you think that they'll probably try to set America up in front of the other countries
[1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:39.280]  as that this is all our fault, just how they did Germany in total?
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:40.280]  That's an interesting point.
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:41.280]  Elaborate on that.
[1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:46.680]  It just made me think that if they're saying it's DEA, because the people that I watched
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:49.680]  it from on the Internet, they were outraged with America.
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:51.760]  We have to say, ah, this is America.
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:56.200]  And if they're doing things like that, assassinating people and saying it's in America's name,
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:46:01.000]  they can make our entire country look like Germany, and especially with them already
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:06.800]  dividing our country within the country, and half of our country is saying the Patriots
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:11.360]  are Nazis, if they're able to do that on a world stage, they can kind of turn the countries
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:12.360]  against us.
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:13.360]  No, I agree.
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:17.160]  Why would you ever going to assassinate a president?
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:21.120]  Why would you show up and say you're DEA, here's some of the surveillance footage for
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:22.280]  TV viewers?
[1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:27.600]  I think the whole thing is very, very suspicious, and I think you're absolutely right, sir.
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:28.600]  And thank you.
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:32.760]  And the one thing I wanted to add, too, is I feel like we have to attack the stores more.
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:37.920]  We have to, like the same way you're branding shirts with the frogs, we have to, the thing
[1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:43.560]  with these bankers and some of these corporates, that's really the source of the problem.
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:49.040]  We got to, whether it's shirts that say bankers are drug lords, because, you know, Chase Bank
[1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:55.480]  was caught two years ago, importing a billion, 1.3 billion worth of cocaine into the U.S.,
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:46:59.920]  or just something like that, that's more something they've been caught for, because when you
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:03.560]  try to get into all they fund, the politicians and all that, that's where just people get
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:04.560]  lost.
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:06.640]  Just something that's in the open blatant.
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:11.800]  And when I tell my friends that and people that I openly show them the articles of these
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:17.440]  companies just getting caught for things, I've had more friends openly talk about going
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:21.280]  away from Chase Bank and stuff like that by showing them that these are really the criminals
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:22.280]  brand.
[1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:23.280]  No, I hear you.
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:24.280]  Great points, brother.
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:26.920]  I'm glad you raised that, because I wanted to get into the assassination of the Haitian
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:32.960]  president and his wife and, and reportedly others, and the footage looks very suspicious,
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:33.960]  very bad.
[1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:37.760]  And hell, Biden's so arrogant and so out of control, who knows, it might have been the
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:38.760]  U.S.
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:41.520]  government, because our government's basically gone, but it might have probably was another
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:43.200]  group posing as U.S.
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:49.840]  government if just on average, and again, on average, you're not going to have the U.S.
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:53.440]  government try to do that or dress up and say it's the DEA.
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:55.480]  And I watched some of the goons running around out there.
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:48:01.200]  And they just didn't quite have the bearing of some of the folks that would do that.
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:04.440]  If they were going to kill the president, they'd drop a bomb on them and say somebody
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:06.600]  blew the house up, they'd use a drone.
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:08.240]  I just don't see the U.S.
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:10.320]  government doing something that obvious.
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:14.160]  But who knows, my God, things are so out of control, they can pin anything they want
[1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:15.160]  on Biden.
[1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:16.240]  So they might as well just go ahead and do it.
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:17.560]  So all bets are off.
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:18.720]  The common sense is out the window.
[1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:19.720]  I don't know.
[1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:22.360]  I'm not going to speculate, but we took your call.
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:23.360]  Thank you.
[1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:28.720]  Let's go to Kristen in Pennsylvania, says Trump coming back, question mark, and the
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:29.720]  A.I.
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:30.720]  Antichrist.
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:31.720]  Welcome.
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:32.720]  How you doing, Alex?
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:33.720]  I'm good to talk to you.
[1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  Go ahead.
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:35.720]  Okay.
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:37.880]  So real quick, I want to make a comment.
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:42.120]  I refer to you as Alex Jonah, because I know you hate reporting on this stuff and you'd
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:47.720]  rather run away from it all, but you keep coming back because you're such a great man.
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:53.160]  So Trump, we all love him, but we've got to keep in mind that it's not a coincidence
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:56.320]  that Trump pents trumpets.
[1:48:56.320 --> 1:49:01.480]  It says in the Bible that the trumpets of revelation will sound at God's last trump.
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:05.160]  When he comes back is when things are going to get really bad for the world.
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:08.200]  So we need to get ourselves prepared.
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:14.840]  And another thing is, I think a lot of people have what is written in revelation mixed up
[1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:16.200]  and confused.
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:18.920]  The false prophet isn't going to be some guy.
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:24.000]  It's mainstream media is the false prophet and the Antichrist is A.I.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.440]  It says that the Antichrist will be seated in the temple of God.
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:30.360]  We are the temple of God.
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:33.840]  That's going to happen when Neuralink is implanted into people's brain.
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:38.040]  The Antichrist will be in us, the temple of God.
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:42.960]  Well, there's no doubt it's religious for the globalist to make us take the shot, which
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:45.760]  is killing a bunch of people, but I think that's a side effect.
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:50.720]  I think death's a side effect, there's something else the shot's doing mutating us, turning
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:51.720]  us into something new.
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:53.320]  This is really religious.
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:57.120]  When you look at the globalist pushing it, they get really excited, and it's not just
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:58.400]  about killing people.
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:00.360]  They're excited about what they think they're doing.
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:03.000]  What do you think that is?
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.640]  They're making us over into the image of the beast.
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:10.240]  They're rebuilding the temple of God, the third temple.
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:16.040]  I think the first temple was when Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, and they had
[1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:17.560]  a spiritual body.
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:23.560]  The second temple is us, and the third temple is man with made into machine, basically.
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:28.360]  That's what they said they were doing, thank you for the call, Chris, and the great points.
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:33.080]  Up next is, gosh, there's so many callers here, who's been home the longest.
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:34.080]  I'll just do that.
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:37.000]  It's easier just to go to who's been home the longest.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.920]  Let's go to Tyler in Maine.
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:40.920]  You're on the year.
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:41.920]  Thanks for holding.
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:42.920]  Go ahead.
[1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:43.920]  Hey, Alex.
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:44.920]  It's great to be on with you.
[1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:45.920]  It's an honor.
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:46.920]  Honor, talk to you.
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:47.920]  Awesome.
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:56.560]  First thing I wanted to do is say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:51:02.200]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[1:51:02.200 --> 1:51:03.200]  for a few of you.
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:04.200]  It definitely works.
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:05.200]  It's not a joke.
[1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:06.200]  Absolutely.
[1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:13.680]  And number two, I know you were talking about bugs and certain programming for the kids
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:16.440]  and for us to eat bugs.
[1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:22.080]  And my 10-year-old goes to a summer camp, I won't say the company, but they have an
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:29.600]  all things bug day coming up in August, including a complete edible bug buffet.
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:33.480]  And we've already told them that that's probably not going to happen and don't touch it.
[1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:39.240]  It's just crazy between the pedophilia and the programming of all the different things
[1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:40.240]  that they have going on.
[1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:43.360]  It's all about getting us to do things that we are against.
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:44.360]  Absolutely.
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:47.960]  It's all about getting us to not be repulsed by things we should.
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:51.760]  Yeah, in a starvation situation, there's some insects humans eat.
[1:51:51.760 --> 1:51:52.760]  Fine.
[1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:54.560]  But it doesn't mean we do it on a routine basis.
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:55.560]  We choose to do it.
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:59.000]  Like, I'll tell, I mean, it's a gross story, but I'm sitting there on the toilet yesterday
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:01.200]  morning at like 6 a.m.
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:03.720]  And a damn brown recluse runs onto my foot.
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:04.720]  I thump it.
[1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:05.720]  I kill it.
[1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:07.400]  I'm sure it's hell not going to eat it.
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:09.520]  You know, a brown recluse can kill your ass.
[1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:14.280]  So just the idea that we're going to ingest these things is insane.
[1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:19.720]  Completely disgusting and it's absurd what they're trying to do to our kids and to us.
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:21.960]  Well, it's about the filing us.
[1:52:21.960 --> 1:52:25.320]  What do you make of the San Francisco choirs saying your kids are ours.
[1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:27.240]  We're going to have sex with them.
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:28.760]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:31.960]  And it was one of those things that me and my better half were just watching it when
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:35.360]  you played it and and she says, you made the comment.
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:41.040]  I think everybody in America should have to watch this video, whether they they feel
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:45.240]  like they can't stomach it or not, because it's something that's so important that's
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:46.240]  happening right now.
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:47.240]  Well, exactly.
[1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:48.240]  That's it.
[1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:50.440]  It's not about acceptance and being nice people.
[1:52:50.440 --> 1:52:51.680]  I'm nice.
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:52.680]  They don't want us to accept.
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:54.280]  They want to take us over.
[1:52:54.280 --> 1:52:56.640]  They want our children, their pedophiles.
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:02.040]  They should leave us alone and we should start saying no to them and boycotting and suing
[1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:03.760]  schools and everything they're doing this.
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:08.200]  But they've gotten a bunch of Stockholm syndrome women that run schools predominantly to let
[1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:12.520]  all these perverts, sick men in that are really pedophiles.
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:14.160]  And so this is the pedophile invasion.
[1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:17.080]  They want our children so bad.
[1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:18.720]  They engineered this whole thing.
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:23.040]  All right, forest, Charles, Josh, Jeff, Jason.
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:31.280]  It all shines up next, Pete, Sebastian, Jacob, Eric, we're getting to all of you in our number
[1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:35.000]  three that is only two minutes away.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:38.960]  And remember wherever you're listening to us, radio, TV station or the Internet, tell
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:44.280]  folks to join the broadcast pedophiles for three, three.
[1:53:44.280 --> 1:53:49.360]  So we have free shipping, double patriot points through this weekend and our big loss leader
[1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:56.520]  is X2 in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60% off and your purchase funds
[1:53:56.520 --> 1:53:57.520]  the M4.
[1:53:57.520 --> 1:54:01.320]  But seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because
[1:54:01.320 --> 1:54:02.520]  of lack of iodine.
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:06.240]  You need to experience it for yourself, takes two weeks to a month to kick in.
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:07.400]  Try it and tell me what you think.
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:09.240]  You can't lose your fund in the M4.
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:14.800]  And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:15.800]  research.
[1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:22.440]  I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do without deep breath, crystal iodine and X2.
[1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:25.800]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible.
[1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.080]  What it did for libido is incredible.
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:30.080]  When I don't take it, I feel the difference.
[1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:32.000]  When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:37.200]  Get your X2 today, discounted the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take it under
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:39.400]  your tongue at infowarstore.com.
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:45.600]  The globalist hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful deep breath, crystal iodine is.
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:46.600]  Harold of South Carolina.
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:47.600]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:48.600]  I'm trying to move quicker.
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:49.600]  Hey, Alex.
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:50.600]  Welcome.
[1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:54.200]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:55.200]  stupidity.
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:54:58.280]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:05.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:06.480]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:10.840]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:12.240]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:17.960]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:24.720]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:29.680]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:35.080]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:36.800]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:41.240]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:48.480]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:57.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:55:57.160 --> 1:56:13.040]  Look, as negative as things are, at least we were aware of what was coming and we're
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:14.880]  not being caught flat footed.
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:20.880]  But if we simply say no and speak up and know that God is there with us at the same time,
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:21.880]  we can't lose.
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:23.520]  Let's move through a lot of your calls.
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:25.120]  These are amazing callers so far.
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:30.720]  Sebastian in Washington says the media manipulation and how it brainwashes families.
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:32.720]  Give us your take on that.
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:37.640]  Well, let me just say I'm a first on caller and what I've had to deal with with my family
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:43.840]  has been mostly sad, but in a way it's so sad that it actually is funny in a way.
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:48.560]  Like I'll just say I have a background in journalism and broadcasting.
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.840]  I studied journalism for three years.
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:53.440]  I've done six years as a radio DJ.
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:57.880]  And I kind of learned about the media and why I can't really trust it.
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:02.520]  So I tried to tell my family, I'm like, look, they're just so brainwashed by the mainstream
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:06.200]  media, every single thing that they see, they take it to heart.
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:10.520]  They sit there at the edge of their seat every time they see the news, they have to live
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:11.520]  by it.
[1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:16.320]  I've had some of them, the second that a shot came available, they had to leave a family
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:18.680]  meeting and run and take it.
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:25.680]  And the level of manipulation that there, I was around my brother and his fiance a few
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:26.680]  months ago.
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:31.240]  I had to move out of my house at the time and I had to drop what I was doing out of
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:33.560]  the kindness of my heart to help them.
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:37.600]  This is the kind of craziness that they're doing because I was around them in a near
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:44.000]  vicinity for two weeks after I left their home.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:50.360]  My brother called me and complained and said, well, my fiance, because you were around us,
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:53.920]  she's going to be wearing a mask around the house for the next two weeks.
[1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:58.240]  Now this isn't like a BDSM 50 shades of gray type mask.
[1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:00.280]  No, this is a cloth based diaper.
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:05.520]  Sure, but they're all into the hysteria and using it to be a victim that they're like
[1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:08.240]  interfacing with the media and like, oh, it's so cool.
[1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:09.240]  I'm doing this.
[1:58:09.240 --> 1:58:10.240]  They're idiots.
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:11.240]  And I'm sorry.
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:14.400]  If you're a family member, it's not going to end well with that woman.
[1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:17.240]  She is satanically connected a lot.
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:18.440]  Oh, yeah.
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:24.080]  And a total like social justice keyboard warrior were like, to the point where like, if someone
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:28.960]  goes out in the street and yells, I identify as a duck pill platypus and you don't, you
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:34.840]  do something as anything shy of throwing them a parade with confetti flowing through the
[1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:35.840]  air.
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:36.840]  You're a racist.
[1:58:36.840 --> 1:58:37.840]  You're a bigot.
[1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:40.640]  You know, you can laugh at her and say she's an idiot.
[1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:43.920]  She's a woman and a lot of women rebel against tyranny.
[1:58:43.920 --> 1:58:46.760]  But many women, men too, they stock home.
[1:58:46.760 --> 1:58:50.920]  They go, I will join with the authority of the Japanese or tough folks, but they will
[1:58:50.920 --> 1:58:51.920]  go under authority.
[1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:52.920]  It's the same thing.
[1:58:52.920 --> 1:58:53.920]  Oh, yeah.
[1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:57.400]  She's like, well, the authority says this and she's just trying to conform sheet to
[1:58:57.400 --> 1:58:58.400]  her.
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:03.280]  You see, even though it's her own destruction, she's trying to conform to what she believes
[1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:04.280]  is victory.
[1:59:04.280 --> 1:59:05.280]  Yeah.
[1:59:05.280 --> 1:59:11.320]  And it's just the, I've like, obviously like, I've been kind of the black sheep in my family,
[1:59:11.320 --> 1:59:15.400]  like most of my life, but I'm the one who out throughout this whole pandemic was trying
[1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:19.280]  to, you know, get the family together and be like, you know what?
[1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:21.520]  We may have our differences, but we are a family.
[1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:24.280]  What really matters is that we should be a family.
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:28.560]  Let's treat each other as such, but the division has never been worse.
[1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:33.920]  And when these shots first started coming out, like at the beginning of the year, my
[1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:39.760]  family said what we should do is we need to gang together and we need to force my 93 year
[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:42.960]  old grandmother to take the shot.
[1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:49.120]  The first day it rolls out that we need, and then when she dies, we, we, we, we fetish
[1:59:49.120 --> 1:59:51.280]  it and kind of get off on a little bit.
[1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:52.280]  Yeah.
[1:59:52.280 --> 1:59:57.080]  And Alex, it's the craziness is I, I'm the only, everyone else was like, yes, yes, we
[1:59:57.080 --> 1:59:58.160]  need to make her do it.
[1:59:58.160 --> 1:59:59.920]  We need to make her do it.
[1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:05.720]  I am the only one in the family to go, you know, maybe we should let her make a decision
[2:00:05.720 --> 2:00:07.200]  on her own.
[2:00:07.200 --> 2:00:10.320]  Oh, I got backlash, like crazy.
[2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:11.440]  I was ridiculed.
[2:00:11.440 --> 2:00:16.800]  I was chastised and I was, I was wrong in every way shape or form.
[2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:18.080]  How dare I open my mind?
[2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:19.080]  How dare I disagree?
[2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:21.080]  So what happened to her?
[2:00:21.080 --> 2:00:23.200]  Oh, she took the shot.
[2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:24.200]  They ended up getting her.
[2:00:24.200 --> 2:00:29.880]  I'm the, now I'm the only person in my family to not take the shot and it's crazy.
[2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:32.120]  I have the messages I could even send over.
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:33.760]  Hey, brother, they don't respect you.
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:35.600]  They're in a hypnotized state.
[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:36.600]  I still love your family.
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:37.760]  Don't let the dead bury the dead.
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:40.760]  I'd move on and create your own family with the one that knows what's going on.
[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:42.760]  So sorry to hear that.
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:43.760]  Yeah.
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:44.760]  We'll be right back.
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:45.760]  Stay with us.
[2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:47.760]  More calls in 60 seconds.
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:59.160]  We know that the satanic principalities of this planet won us poison.
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:00.160]  They want to attack our bodies.
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:03.640]  They want to kill us because we're made in the image of God.
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:08.680]  But God gave us the components of ourselves, of our bodies to be strong.
[2:01:08.680 --> 2:01:10.160]  We've got everything we need.
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:14.720]  That's what the globalists hit us with the bad halogens of fluoride, fluorine, bromide,
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:18.920]  you name it, instead of iodine, our food, our water, our plants, everything we eat is
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:23.320]  deficient and the average person is deficient and it attacks your IQ, it attacks your stamina
[2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:26.160]  and your libido and fertility particularly.
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:27.160]  Look into it.
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:31.040]  On the other side, you're going to find anywhere on the planet in X2 and it's discounted right
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:33.560]  now with free shipping for 40% off in the dropper bottle.
[2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:35.400]  We have it for 60% off in the spray bottle.
[2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:38.240]  It's the exact same formula but I want you to experience it for yourself.
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.920]  We've been on the fence about iodine.
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:40.920]  This is the best.
[2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:41.920]  Try it today.
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:43.720]  It takes about 15 days to kick in.
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:48.440]  It's exclusively available at mfoldwarestore.com right now and it funds the M4.
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:02:01.840]  The way you fail is not taking action.
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:05.680]  In 1814, we took a little trip.
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:11.160]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:15.120]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:19.320]  the town in New Orleans, we fired our guns and the British kept becoming.
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:23.920]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago, we fired one small one and they began
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:29.920]  to run in on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:33.320]  We looked down the river and we see the British come and they must have been...
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:34.320]  All right.
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:38.560]  Let me hit this controversy that I want right back to your phone calls, loaded phone lines
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:39.560]  here.
[2:02:39.560 --> 2:02:44.720]  Soul shines up next and so many others but it became a big controversy this week.
[2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:50.600]  With Brian Stelter with almost no viewers, I mean literally they had like a half million
[2:02:50.600 --> 2:02:57.520]  viewers on CNN just dead last in the TV cable news area but on Twitter they had 20 million
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:02:58.520]  views.
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.200]  On Facebook they had millions of views.
[2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:06.480]  I mean it was a huge story this week but only because they attacked Tucker Carlson and Alex
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:13.600]  Jones and then Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy became these giant laughing stocks and I predict
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:18.800]  this weekend when they air their show it'll be even lower ratings.
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:20.920]  It's the lowest it's ever been for him.
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:26.800]  So my old friend lives here in Austin now Joe Rogan waited into this with Adam Curry,
[2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:33.160]  the founder of podcast yesterday and defended myself and Tucker Carlson.
[2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:39.440]  I appreciate the defense of reality but it's got them in full panic mode because you know
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:44.560]  Joe Rogan's got his average podcast gets watched about 10 million times.
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:50.240]  The big ones 50, 60, 100 million times and now you think Brian Stelter can't get a half
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:51.240]  million viewers.
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:57.960]  Imagine the soap appointed CNN, you know big tech, Time Warner funds him, he's supposedly
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:04.680]  God and then here's Joe Rogan with oh my small show's 10 million, my big show's 80 million,
[2:04:04.680 --> 2:04:07.160]  my top show's 150 million.
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:11.920]  Oh yeah I've done Joe Rogan's shows with 150 million viewers, you count all the different
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:12.920]  systems up.
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:16.640]  Elon Musk is the only one that's got a bigger podcast than me.
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:19.760]  He's got 150 million, I got like 110 million.
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:27.480]  So again people want freedom, it's not about oh I've got 100 million viewers, it's not
[2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:32.640]  about that, it's about you want freedom, it's not me, it's that you want that, you love
[2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:39.720]  freedom, you're with it, you get it and they want to gaslight and say that's a bad thing.
[2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:46.400]  But it doesn't work because a little Joe Rogan show has 10 million viewers and a big Joe
[2:04:46.400 --> 2:04:51.640]  Rogan show has 70 million viewers and a hot Joe Rogan show has 100 million viewers and
[2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:54.920]  a record Joe Rogan show has 160 million viewers.
[2:04:54.920 --> 2:05:02.480]  It's all known, what are you going to do about that when all the shows got 110 million viewers.
[2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:06.760]  Well, you call for it to be shut down don't you because you can't compete because the
[2:05:06.760 --> 2:05:09.360]  people are actually good, they want the truth.
[2:05:09.360 --> 2:05:13.560]  So here's Adam Curry and Joe Rogan yesterday.
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:18.760]  Everywhere there's all kinds of, it's information war, I give Alex Jones that 100%, I've always
[2:05:18.760 --> 2:05:23.120]  been jealous of info wars because that's what we're living in, it's truly information
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:28.680]  war and this has been waged on us going back to the 60s.
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:33.200]  There was a funny thing where Brian Stelter was on CNN comparing Tucker Carlson to Alex
[2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:34.200]  Jones.
[2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:35.200]  I saw that this morning.
[2:05:35.200 --> 2:05:38.800]  And they were showing things that Tucker Carlson said versus things that Alex Jones
[2:05:38.800 --> 2:05:43.440]  said and they were like, are these guys, he said it in such funny dismissive ways, like
[2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:46.800]  are they bros, are they exchanging information?
[2:05:46.800 --> 2:05:54.120]  But what he didn't show by doing this, by pointing out the two things that Alex Jones
[2:05:54.120 --> 2:06:04.040]  talked about and Tucker Carlson talked about, both men were saying things that are logical.
[2:06:04.040 --> 2:06:09.120]  They're both saying what you said earlier, like there was most likely agent provocateurs
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:16.440]  that at least had some part in that January 6th invasion of Capitol Hill.
[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:17.920]  That's not an outrageous thing to say.
[2:06:17.920 --> 2:06:24.600]  So just by connecting him to Alex Jones, he's trying to dismiss Tucker Carlson.
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:29.520]  But what he's not dismissing is the actual veracity of the statements.
[2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:30.520]  He's not...
[2:06:30.520 --> 2:06:31.520]  Of course not.
[2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:37.040]  But the things that he's saying aren't that outrageous, like what were the things that
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:38.040]  they pointed out?
[2:06:38.040 --> 2:06:42.400]  See if you can find that, but there's a clip that's online.
[2:06:42.400 --> 2:06:43.880]  It was all about January 6th.
[2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:46.160]  It was several things.
[2:06:46.160 --> 2:06:48.080]  But those things were not outrageous.
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:53.200]  It's not like the gender-dimensional choplisters are coming through your window.
[2:06:53.200 --> 2:06:55.120]  You do such a good thing with Alex Jones.
[2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:57.240]  I know the guy forever.
[2:06:57.240 --> 2:07:01.560]  I need like a jingle, like Alex Jones' Adam Curry jingle from you just so I can do it.
[2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:05.520]  I actually play Alex Jones in Sturgill Simpson's album.
[2:07:05.520 --> 2:07:11.360]  Sturgill Simpson's and his most recent album, the opening segment a guy gets in the car
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:15.960]  and he's spinning through the radio dials trying to find something to listen to.
[2:07:15.960 --> 2:07:20.560]  And there's Alex Jones ranting and raving about the Illuminati and that's me.
[2:07:20.560 --> 2:07:21.560]  Really?
[2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:22.560]  Yeah.
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:23.560]  Oh, wow.
[2:07:23.560 --> 2:07:24.560]  You're good, man.
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:25.560]  That's good.
[2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:26.560]  That's good.
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:27.560]  You got it down.
[2:07:27.560 --> 2:07:28.560]  Yeah.
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:29.560]  Okay, so here it is.
[2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:30.560]  This is Oliver Darcy.
[2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:31.560]  Is this a...
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:32.560]  Is this a smokable one?
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:33.560]  Yeah.
[2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:34.560]  Yeah.
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:35.560]  Yeah.
[2:07:35.560 --> 2:07:36.560]  Oh, here so.
[2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:37.560]  You got to let it.
[2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:38.560]  January 6th.
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:39.560]  Let's hear what the things are.
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:40.560]  All right.
[2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:41.560]  Go.
[2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:42.560]  Press it from the beginning.
[2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:43.560]  E-mails.
[2:07:43.560 --> 2:07:44.560]  It's not that I think the government...
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:45.560]  My God.
[2:07:45.560 --> 2:07:46.560]  This is 2011.
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:47.560]  It's admitted that they do it.
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:49.260]  It is a lie to say there are no risks.
[2:07:49.260 --> 2:07:51.560]  There are risks in everything, including in...
[2:07:51.560 --> 2:07:52.560]  No, no, no.
[2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:53.560]  Please go back from the beginning.
[2:07:53.560 --> 2:07:54.560]  Go back from the beginning.
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:55.560]  You got killed.
[2:07:55.560 --> 2:07:56.560]  No, no, no.
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:07:59.160]  We didn't hear the beginning because he said something in the beginning about them spying
[2:07:59.160 --> 2:08:03.560]  on him because Tucker Carlson is saying the government's spying on him and then Alex
[2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:06.560]  Jones from a long time ago was saying that they're spying on him.
[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:07.560]  So listen to this.
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:08.560]  E-mails.
[2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:11.520]  It's not that I think the government spies on me.
[2:08:11.520 --> 2:08:12.520]  It's admitted that they do it.
[2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:14.640]  It is a lie to say there are no risks.
[2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:18.520]  There are risks in everything, including in getting a vaccine.
[2:08:18.520 --> 2:08:22.000]  Everybody's got family that got killed or got sick from a vaccine.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:29.120]  So FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6th, according to
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:30.320]  government documents.
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:38.760]  It is overwhelming the evidence that criminal elements of the federal government provocateur
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:41.120]  and staged January 6th.
[2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:42.120]  Okay.
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:43.120]  Pause.
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:44.120]  All right.
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:48.640]  So that, what he just showed, none of that is outrageous.
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:55.480]  First of all, we know from Edward Snowden that the NSA has been monitoring e-mails and
[2:08:55.480 --> 2:08:56.480]  everything.
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:08:57.480]  So that's fact.
[2:08:57.480 --> 2:08:59.400]  Well, it's a little different.
[2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:03.120]  They collect everything and then when they need it, they go in and get it.
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:04.120]  Exactly.
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:08.240]  But the idea that they're not monitoring Alex Jones is insane, right?
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:09.240]  Of course.
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:14.160]  But whether or not they're monitoring Tucker Carlson, I don't know, I don't know, but we
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:16.160]  know that they have the ability to do so.
[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:20.240]  When Edward Snowden exposed this, this is truth, right?
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:21.360]  They've admitted it.
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:23.240]  This is why he's living in Russia now, right?
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:24.860]  This is why he's on the run.
[2:09:24.860 --> 2:09:26.360]  So there's that.
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:32.600]  Then he, Tucker Carlson said that there's some risk to the vaccines.
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:35.380]  There is a risk to every medication that people take.
[2:09:35.380 --> 2:09:41.440]  It's a relatively small risk, like if 170 million people have been vaccinated, if it
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:48.480]  was just 1% died, we would have a million, 700,000 deaths from the vaccine.
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:50.640]  That's outrageous and it's not the case.
[2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:54.160]  So it's a very small risk, relatively.
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:55.160]  I don't know.
[2:09:55.160 --> 2:09:58.200]  I mean, there's no numbers that I can look at.
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:09:59.720]  So that's true.
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:01.080]  So what he said is true.
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:03.960]  He didn't say that it's a terrible thing.
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:04.960]  Don't get it.
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:05.960]  He's not killing everybody.
[2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:06.960]  He's not what he said.
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:08.680]  He said there is a risk.
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:14.200]  Alex Jones says everybody knows someone who's died or who's been hurt by the vaccine.
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:16.160]  I know people that have had strokes.
[2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:18.680]  I know people that have had adverse reactions.
[2:10:18.680 --> 2:10:20.480]  That's why the VAERS report exists.
[2:10:20.480 --> 2:10:24.160]  Now, do I know that they absolutely got those strokes from the vaccine?
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:25.840]  Of course I don't.
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:27.080]  There's a lot of correlation.
[2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:28.320]  Does that mean causation?
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:29.320]  We don't know.
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:30.320]  We don't know what we don't know.
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:31.320]  What he factually said was not.
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:33.520]  But what he said is not outrageous.
[2:10:33.520 --> 2:10:39.520]  So they're comparing these things in this really weird, disingenuous way to try to make
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:45.120]  it look like everything that Tucker Carlson is saying is insane because Alex Jones says
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:46.120]  something as well.
[2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:51.160]  If Alex Jones says drink water and take vitamins, and I say drink water, take vitamins, am I
[2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:52.160]  Alex Jones?
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:53.400]  What does that mean?
[2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:56.080]  The other thing that he said was the Capitol Hill thing.
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:11:01.240]  Now if there are government files that if you could read these government papers that
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:07.000]  actually do say that there were agent provocateurs that had something to do with the Capitol
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:13.880]  Hill attack, if Alex Jones says that and Tucker Carlson says that, but yet the fact remains
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:16.120]  that it's true, who gives a fuck?
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:18.040]  And how are they making that connection?
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:19.800]  That connection is so weird.
[2:11:19.800 --> 2:11:23.200]  And the connection is just to try to discredit Tucker Carlson.
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:25.400]  But that this is your news.
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:26.400]  This is coming from America.
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:27.400]  That's right.
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:28.400]  They're scared.
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:29.400]  Right.
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:30.400]  And that this is how this is.
[2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:35.640]  And the full video of Adam Curry and Joe Rogan is that in FullWars.com.
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:36.640]  It's also in Spotify.
[2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:37.640]  Hi there.
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:38.640]  Thank you, Joe.
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:41.520]  I told you, folks, once Joe got free, he was going to be hardcore now.
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:42.520]  You're all seeing it.
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:43.520]  I told you six, eight months ago.
[2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:44.520]  I told you a year ago.
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:45.520]  And I see it now.
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:46.520]  We'll be right back.
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:47.520]  Stay with us.

[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:02.000]  It changes the world.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.580]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:12:04.580 --> 2:12:06.080]  They know you're angry.
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:10.440]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:11.440]  we've got.

[2:12:57.560 --> 2:12:58.560]  Granny Dewright.
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:00.260]  Oh you're on the air, go ahead.
[2:13:00.260 --> 2:13:06.080]  Yeah, first of all, let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:11.080]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sun
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:16.280]  spots or H spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X-2 for the last couple
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:20.000]  of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.320]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:13:23.320 --> 2:13:27.400]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:31.620]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started
[2:13:31.620 --> 2:13:36.580]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started
[2:13:36.580 --> 2:13:41.700]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[2:13:41.700 --> 2:13:48.020]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:52.300]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:13:52.300 --> 2:13:56.580]  I never had a marketing plan for ImpalWars. I went out and found the best products I could
[2:13:56.580 --> 2:14:00.860]  find from the research to funder operation. I wanted you to get products that empowered
[2:14:00.860 --> 2:14:04.700]  you that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more. I treat you like I want
[2:14:04.700 --> 2:14:08.340]  to be treated. It's very, very simple. It's instinctive. It's spiritual. It's what I
[2:14:08.340 --> 2:14:13.140]  do. And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers and X2 right now is
[2:14:13.140 --> 2:14:19.660]  discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[2:14:19.660 --> 2:14:23.220]  And so I'm going to catch 22. When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it, but we're
[2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:26.820]  selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns. And so I'm going
[2:14:26.820 --> 2:14:31.340]  to catch 22. I need to sell products at full price, but I can't. I got to sell them at
[2:14:31.340 --> 2:14:36.260]  discount. And so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray
[2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:41.140]  bottle, even though it's about to sell out. It won't be available for months. So get it.
[2:14:41.140 --> 2:14:46.780]  X2 is selling out at ImpalWarsTour.com for 40 and 60% off with double patriot points
[2:14:46.780 --> 2:14:50.660]  and free shipping because why? That's when you buy it. We need your funds or it'll be
[2:14:50.660 --> 2:15:16.180]  off air. It's an amazing product. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. It's not a confidence
[2:15:16.180 --> 2:15:21.780]  game that I'm scared to cover this news. It's the opposite. I don't feel confident right
[2:15:21.780 --> 2:15:27.500]  now. I'm sitting here with the keys to destiny. I'm sitting here with the answers to defeat
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:34.540]  the globalist. And I feel pathetic. I don't know what to do. I got a loaded phone line
[2:15:34.540 --> 2:15:41.700]  with so many incredible souls calling here. My soul shined. And right here I got patents
[2:15:41.700 --> 2:15:53.260]  and bills all named 666, which are the corporate filings on our destruction. And if I cover
[2:15:53.260 --> 2:15:59.780]  it, nobody cares. It's weird. If I sat here for a month saying I'm going to release the
[2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:04.940]  ultimate secret, I'm going to defeat them, I'm going to annihilate them, and then I did
[2:16:04.940 --> 2:16:12.180]  it. We beat them. But that doesn't feel like me to sit on this like I'm sitting on some
[2:16:12.180 --> 2:16:26.140]  egg or something. I don't know what to do. You know, if I could like cut my fingers off
[2:16:26.140 --> 2:16:31.740]  to defeat the globalist, I'd do it. Cut my arm off. I mean, I'd do anything to beat them.
[2:16:31.740 --> 2:16:37.660]  I really do want to beat them. But see, I can't do that alone, can I? Because what does it
[2:16:37.660 --> 2:16:48.860]  matter if I tell you this? That's the old Rush Limbaugh thing you do. God bless you.
[2:16:48.860 --> 2:16:57.300]  I mean, because if I just mention this, nobody gives a damn. Nobody cares. You know, I never
[2:16:57.300 --> 2:17:04.260]  figure out the Internet. It decides what to take from the show and make big. I've just
[2:17:04.260 --> 2:17:09.260]  got all these bills with 666 on them and total world government force inoculation and taking
[2:17:09.260 --> 2:17:13.300]  you and putting you in a FEMA camp. I mean, it's all right here. I mean, the Democrats
[2:17:13.300 --> 2:17:26.020]  ought to be arrested for creating this. You know, people used to get bomb in circumstance
[2:17:26.020 --> 2:17:30.620]  too. Like when I was a little kid, my dad go, your mom's tired. She wants us to buy this
[2:17:30.620 --> 2:17:35.180]  for the Sunday dinner in the neighborhood store. We'll go to the grocery store. I'd
[2:17:35.180 --> 2:17:40.780]  be driving through Dallas and say, Dad, look, there's spotlights. That means a movie theater.
[2:17:40.780 --> 2:17:44.140]  That means a new movie. Can we go to a movie? Sometimes you go, yeah, let's go out and go
[2:17:44.140 --> 2:17:48.700]  see that movie. One time it was Raiders of the Lost Ark. We pull in, I get milk duds
[2:17:48.700 --> 2:17:53.940]  and popcorn and a Coca-Cola and that go in. We're supposed to go grocery shopping because
[2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:59.780]  mom's tired. We didn't do that. We ran off being dad. We watched Raiders of the Lost
[2:17:59.780 --> 2:18:09.020]  Ark. There were other times too. Like I say, Daddy, that's the big spotlights. That's a
[2:18:09.020 --> 2:18:18.220]  movie. They say, oh, that's a car dealership. But the point is, if we don't make a big deal
[2:18:18.220 --> 2:18:23.380]  about this with all the sea of entertainment and movies and stuff, which they got, everybody
[2:18:23.380 --> 2:18:31.780]  mesmerized with, they don't wake up. How do we break the trance to get people to care
[2:18:31.780 --> 2:18:42.020]  about real stuff that's happening? I've got two bills and a patent called 666 for a world
[2:18:42.020 --> 2:18:50.740]  ID total lockdown martial law system introduced officially by Nancy Pelosi. I mean, this is
[2:18:50.740 --> 2:19:02.540]  what they want. So I ask you again, if I read this to you right now, you wouldn't care and
[2:19:02.540 --> 2:19:12.940]  it would have no effect. So what do I do? What do I do? I don't know what I do. I just
[2:19:12.940 --> 2:19:19.860]  know this. We're in a lot of trouble, ladies and gentlemen. So I want to take your calls
[2:19:19.860 --> 2:19:26.340]  right now. So the next 45 minutes, I want to get to every person that's holding before
[2:19:26.340 --> 2:19:39.700]  J. Dyer takes over in the fourth hour today. But there's something particularly disgusting
[2:19:39.700 --> 2:19:54.300]  about reading the enemy bragging what they're doing to us because I love everybody legitimately.
[2:19:54.300 --> 2:20:10.060]  Hell, I love my cat. I love my dog. I love my daughter. I love my son. I love my daughters.
[2:20:10.060 --> 2:20:16.700]  I don't need to say I'm not a racist. I like black people. It's almost sick to say that
[2:20:16.700 --> 2:20:21.300]  I'm not a racist. I really like you. But do I like you when you say I'm back as I'm white
[2:20:21.300 --> 2:20:24.580]  and you're all in my face and you've been told you to do what you want to me because
[2:20:24.580 --> 2:20:29.580]  I'm white? No, to a certain point, it's like, I don't want to war with you because of what
[2:20:29.580 --> 2:20:33.860]  color you are, but I'm not going to bow down to you because you're buying into some corporate
[2:20:33.860 --> 2:20:44.980]  lie. And that's really where we're at. We either transcend this now or we're done. So
[2:20:44.980 --> 2:20:47.220]  I'm going to go to break. I'll come back. I'm going to promise I'm going to take every
[2:20:47.220 --> 2:20:54.980]  damn color we got. I like 20 people on here, but forest and Charlie and soul shines up
[2:20:54.980 --> 2:20:59.220]  next. We're going to get to all of you. And if I don't say this, I won't be here. So let
[2:20:59.220 --> 2:21:03.220]  me go ahead and say this again to everybody. Plus, these are amazing products. Let me just
[2:21:03.220 --> 2:21:06.220]  go ahead and get this out to everybody right now because we won't be here if you don't
[2:21:06.220 --> 2:21:11.340]  support us. And I guess that's God's game. That's how God works. I haven't figured it
[2:21:11.340 --> 2:21:18.140]  out yet, but if you don't support us, we won't be here. You know, if I had trillions of dollars
[2:21:18.140 --> 2:21:21.820]  like the globalists, I'd beat them, but see, I'm not Satan. So I don't have that. Do I?
[2:21:21.820 --> 2:21:27.620]  And I'm not complaining. I'm not a victim. I've got the deed of this planet just like
[2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:34.220]  you do. I got the deed to Jesus Christ and a new soul and a new system and to be forgiven
[2:21:34.220 --> 2:21:41.420]  and to transmute all that and go to the next level. But I still just can't sit back on
[2:21:41.420 --> 2:21:48.020]  my laurels and watch all this evil take place. I've got to take action. So it's simple.
[2:21:48.020 --> 2:21:54.660]  I'm sponsored by you, not the Satanist. You can go to infowarstore.com right there. It
[2:21:54.660 --> 2:22:00.100]  says become a sponsor. We can make a one time donation or a regular donation. You can cancel
[2:22:00.100 --> 2:22:04.580]  any time it's there. That funds our operation. But let me tell you what's happening. We've
[2:22:04.580 --> 2:22:08.460]  got free shipping this weekend, double paid credit points, and then it's over. We're going
[2:22:08.460 --> 2:22:15.220]  to have free shipping and stuff till November. And we have everything we've got on sale.
[2:22:15.220 --> 2:22:19.900]  Even though selling out of it means we won't have money in the future. I'm not bitching,
[2:22:19.900 --> 2:22:24.620]  but the breakdown in the supply chain is a problem. But it doesn't matter. You've got
[2:22:24.620 --> 2:22:27.980]  to get the money in. So if you've got to sell stuff discounted, even though more is not
[2:22:27.980 --> 2:22:34.540]  coming in, you do it. Here's what you should know. We have survival
[2:22:34.540 --> 2:22:39.300]  shield X2 that is the highest quality pure deep breath crystal iodine at 40% off with
[2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:44.380]  free shipping double paid your points. And it's available right now despite the fact
[2:22:44.380 --> 2:22:48.700]  that current sales rates, it'll be sold out within two weeks. And we have the exact same
[2:22:48.700 --> 2:23:01.740]  X2 but with a spray bottle top for 60% off at $12 a bottle. It cost us $9 a bottle.
[2:23:01.740 --> 2:23:06.420]  But that's the point I've reached where I'll just sell what I've got even though I won't
[2:23:06.420 --> 2:23:09.700]  have money to buy stuff in the future. I'll get on the phone, I guess to a bunch of big
[2:23:09.700 --> 2:23:14.340]  donors and beg for money because I'm going to go down swinging. But this is what's going
[2:23:14.340 --> 2:23:23.700]  on. We have the X2 spray bottle. We have the X2 dropper bottle 40 and 60% off with free
[2:23:23.700 --> 2:23:29.300]  shipping double paid three points, lost leaders to fund their operation. Then force for calm
[2:23:29.300 --> 2:23:33.940]  because listen, how do you think it works in this universe? I'm not on air. I'm not
[2:23:33.940 --> 2:23:39.740]  here attacking the globalist without support. And we've got turbo force discounted. We've
[2:23:39.740 --> 2:23:44.460]  got alpha power, vaso beans, bottom block, thermal vitality, bio tricillinium, ultimate
[2:23:44.460 --> 2:23:54.700]  krill oil, water filtration, all of it discounted until Sunday at infowarstore.com. Your voice
[2:23:54.700 --> 2:24:00.620]  counts. When you share information be it over the internet or in person, it changes the
[2:24:00.620 --> 2:24:05.420]  world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And now
[2:24:05.420 --> 2:24:10.300]  to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:25:31.860 --> 2:25:56.940]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked
[2:25:56.940 --> 2:26:00.620]  about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but
[2:26:00.620 --> 2:26:04.340]  I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have
[2:26:04.340 --> 2:26:08.700]  so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have
[2:26:08.700 --> 2:26:12.060]  time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons, I can't tell
[2:26:12.060 --> 2:26:16.100]  you what's going on. But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end, we're
[2:26:16.100 --> 2:26:21.180]  going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products
[2:26:21.180 --> 2:26:24.980]  and then forward store.com. They're great products. Plus, they fund the operation.
[2:26:24.980 --> 2:26:28.940]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom?
[2:26:28.940 --> 2:26:33.900]  No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the
[2:26:33.900 --> 2:26:38.260]  whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:26:38.260 --> 2:26:42.100]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air. So while you're
[2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:45.820]  at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've
[2:26:45.820 --> 2:26:49.620]  done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[2:26:49.620 --> 2:26:52.340]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:26:52.340 --> 2:26:57.740]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021. And I just want to say something.
[2:26:57.740 --> 2:27:02.100]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[2:27:02.100 --> 2:27:06.420]  the years and is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[2:27:06.420 --> 2:27:10.420]  you, the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[2:27:10.420 --> 2:27:14.020]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter. You've got
[2:27:14.020 --> 2:27:18.860]  red blood. And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we
[2:27:18.860 --> 2:27:24.100]  are brothers and sisters together. And it has just been an incredible experience to work
[2:27:24.100 --> 2:27:27.980]  with you over the years. And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the
[2:27:27.980 --> 2:27:33.900]  future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works
[2:27:33.900 --> 2:27:38.620]  through you and puts a message in your heart to support us. But again, that's up to you
[2:27:38.620 --> 2:27:42.300]  and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support
[2:27:42.300 --> 2:27:46.220]  you've given us and what you've done. And just ask you again to pray to God and ask
[2:27:46.220 --> 2:27:50.460]  what God's vision is for you. And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support
[2:27:50.460 --> 2:27:54.940]  us. God bless.
[2:27:54.940 --> 2:28:20.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:36.540]  Look, evil is going to make us run as humanity. And so we look at what's happening and it's
[2:28:36.540 --> 2:28:42.580]  totally scary out of control. But it's all right. It's part of God's plan. I was talking
[2:28:42.580 --> 2:28:46.980]  to an old shroyer who takes over here about an hour and a half. And he was just like,
[2:28:46.980 --> 2:28:51.300]  what do we do? How do we respond to this? At a certain point, you just can't politically
[2:28:51.300 --> 2:28:55.740]  even cover the news anymore. You've got to just cry out to God. And really, that's what
[2:28:55.740 --> 2:29:05.780]  it comes down to. We're going to be faced with political and cultural dilemmas that
[2:29:05.780 --> 2:29:11.100]  are so destructive, we're just going to have to give it to God. And that's when it becomes
[2:29:11.100 --> 2:29:17.420]  metaphysical. That's when it becomes spiritual. It's when you're down and you don't have anything
[2:29:17.420 --> 2:29:23.540]  left but God and you fire that bat signal up into the universe. And let me just give
[2:29:23.540 --> 2:29:27.820]  you a little nose flash.
[2:29:27.820 --> 2:29:33.180]  You do that sincerely. It's not for some woman. It's not for your kid to live. It's not for
[2:29:33.180 --> 2:29:40.140]  grandma to get better. It's for humanity. God's going to answer. The question is, are
[2:29:40.140 --> 2:29:48.220]  you ready when those orders come down from the big guy? You ready to follow those orders?
[2:29:48.220 --> 2:29:57.740]  You ready for that power? You ready? To every cell in your body taken over? Because the
[2:29:57.740 --> 2:30:03.540]  enemies energized. They're against our children. They've already been overtaken. God didn't
[2:30:03.540 --> 2:30:13.940]  trick us like Satan did to turn over our will. God's like, I'm ready to take over. Flip
[2:30:13.940 --> 2:30:26.140]  the switch. But here's what it means. You ready to flip that switch? That's a big question
[2:30:26.140 --> 2:30:27.140]  everybody's got to ask.
[2:30:27.140 --> 2:30:33.660]  We've got like $20. Let's go to Soul Shine in South Carolina. You're on the air. Thanks
[2:30:33.660 --> 2:30:34.660]  for holding.
[2:30:34.660 --> 2:30:39.820]  It's my first time calling in today and my first time making a purchase too.
[2:30:39.820 --> 2:30:41.820]  Well, you love you. Go ahead.
[2:30:41.820 --> 2:30:48.780]  Well, for the past, well, since COVID started, I've been tuning in pretty regular listening.
[2:30:48.780 --> 2:30:53.700]  My husband's been a fan for 20 years. I'm going to try to be as articulate and...
[2:30:53.700 --> 2:30:57.580]  Well, you're on air, sweetheart. You go ahead and talk about it.
[2:30:57.580 --> 2:31:03.500]  I'm going to try to be quick and make it as clear as I can. But for the past few weeks,
[2:31:03.500 --> 2:31:08.180]  I've been asking the Holy Spirit a question. And I have this thing where I don't really
[2:31:08.180 --> 2:31:13.980]  trust anyone about spiritual and stuff. I go straight to the force. But I usually open
[2:31:13.980 --> 2:31:18.020]  up the day with, if there's something you want me to hear, I'm ready to listen. If there's
[2:31:18.020 --> 2:31:22.700]  something you want me to see, I'm ready to see it. And I'm up to see it. I'm getting
[2:31:22.700 --> 2:31:29.580]  emotional because every now and then you get one little glimpse. And it's so overwhelming,
[2:31:29.580 --> 2:31:32.580]  you don't know what to do with it.
[2:31:32.580 --> 2:31:41.380]  So I was listening to you talk about, they want to just get rid of it. And I agree. They're
[2:31:41.380 --> 2:31:48.700]  after us. This is the end of nigh, as they say. But I was wondering, you know, these
[2:31:48.700 --> 2:31:54.820]  beliefs, what's in it for them? It's over and done with. What's in it for them because
[2:31:54.820 --> 2:31:55.820]  there's not going to be...
[2:31:55.820 --> 2:32:00.300]  You can understand that there's slaves to Satan. But that's it. They're trying to kill
[2:32:00.300 --> 2:32:05.300]  everybody because they believe if they kill people, they get all the wealth. It's very
[2:32:05.300 --> 2:32:09.980]  stupid. We could build trillions of worlds. We have unlimited power. But they're told,
[2:32:09.980 --> 2:32:15.580]  kill everybody and you'll be empowered. They're just fools. So I wouldn't worry about them.
[2:32:15.580 --> 2:32:21.340]  Absolutely. But I posed the question to the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit understands
[2:32:21.340 --> 2:32:25.460]  your question better than anybody else and knows how to answer it. So I was sitting here
[2:32:25.460 --> 2:32:31.020]  watching your piece on the little children coming across the border and thinking about
[2:32:31.020 --> 2:32:37.580]  how sick and disgusting that was. And you mentioned, I can't remember now where it is,
[2:32:37.580 --> 2:32:42.700]  but you mentioned the engraving or picture of something that says you will have nothing.
[2:32:42.700 --> 2:32:44.700]  You will be nothing and you'll like it.
[2:32:44.700 --> 2:32:46.700]  Yeah, that's Claus Schwab.
[2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:52.940]  Yeah. Okay. Well, I was sitting there and that picture came to mind. And I was like,
[2:32:52.940 --> 2:32:56.860]  well, Holy Spirit, I don't know what you're trying to tell me. Just go ahead and speak.
[2:32:56.860 --> 2:33:04.660]  Well, very clearly it said they're not just for sex. They're not just to torture. They're
[2:33:04.660 --> 2:33:11.180]  your replacement because they're not going to have to be reeducated. They'll just be
[2:33:11.180 --> 2:33:15.500]  educated. They'll be put in these places and they'll be taught to be.
[2:33:15.500 --> 2:33:19.660]  Oh, you want to admit that? I thank you for your call, so shy. Thank you. That's exactly
[2:33:19.660 --> 2:33:24.860]  the omitted plan of the UN. All right, up next is one of the longest now. That would be
[2:33:25.580 --> 2:33:31.820]  Charles in Vegas. White's her evil agenda, race baiting. What do you make of that? Go ahead.
[2:33:31.820 --> 2:33:36.940]  You're on the air. Well, Alex, I hate to hear you talk the way you talked a few minutes ago
[2:33:36.940 --> 2:33:42.380]  that you don't know what to do and you feel pathetic. You do know what to do. You do it every day
[2:33:42.380 --> 2:33:46.220]  and you got a little week there for a minute. You're like that. I'm not saying you're
[2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:51.100]  missing what I'm saying. I'm saying I am weak. God is strong. You know, so there was
[2:33:53.740 --> 2:34:00.380]  the John John Wayne level Patriot American. So I just want to say that it's so obvious what
[2:34:00.380 --> 2:34:06.060]  they are doing. First, it was locking up our Patriots when they did nothing at the rally.
[2:34:06.060 --> 2:34:12.540]  Then it's trying to start a race war all summer. They're hoping right now, now they're doing the
[2:34:12.540 --> 2:34:18.940]  transgender in our face. But see, nothing worked. So now it's the kids and they were sure that that
[2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:25.660]  would trigger white people going off. If we ever decided to have a race war, they know that white
[2:34:25.660 --> 2:34:30.140]  people from, see, they're thinking like back in the seventies because they're all old fogies.
[2:34:30.140 --> 2:34:33.900]  I mean, in the seventies, when there was gay bashing, when I grew up,
[2:34:33.900 --> 2:34:38.140]  yeah, that would have worked. And white people would have went out and there would have been
[2:34:38.140 --> 2:34:44.300]  murder everywhere. But see, that's not working. You're working with 90 year old crazy people
[2:34:44.300 --> 2:34:49.020]  like Charlie Munger trying to start a race war. How do we counter these old demonic pieces of
[2:34:49.020 --> 2:34:56.140]  felt? Well, don't get upset and let them see you get upset about that six, six, six. It's so obvious
[2:34:56.140 --> 2:35:02.220]  that they don't even have the shame or faith to be embarrassed for what the people around the world
[2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:08.060]  think of them. They're kind of like twisted minds and it's all going to just like foam coming out
[2:35:08.060 --> 2:35:13.340]  of the ocean. It's all going to play out. But the fact of the matter is, as far as the vaccines,
[2:35:13.340 --> 2:35:18.060]  the doctors, nurses and a medical world, them are the disappointments to me.
[2:35:19.180 --> 2:35:24.620]  When you see those, play those videos of people going to school boards for critical race theory
[2:35:24.620 --> 2:35:30.460]  against, you know, in the classroom, there's 20, 50 people. There should be 20,000 people.
[2:35:30.460 --> 2:35:34.780]  See, America got weak. These kids are at what, on their knees in the middle of the street,
[2:35:34.780 --> 2:35:41.740]  kissing black people's sneakers, apologizing for being white. That could never be when I grew up.
[2:35:41.740 --> 2:35:47.980]  So if that's what America's really come to, let it fall, let it wash itself out and that'll be the
[2:35:47.980 --> 2:35:53.820]  reset. That'll be the good reason. No, I agree. They know their system's going down. So they called
[2:35:53.820 --> 2:35:59.660]  the reset and act like they did it. They're smartest thing I heard the last year. They are falling
[2:35:59.660 --> 2:36:04.300]  the globalist satanic systems falling. So they want to make it a race war as an attraction
[2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:08.860]  when it's really a human war against them and they have discredited themselves.
[2:36:08.860 --> 2:36:13.180]  They are the great reset. Their collapse is the great reset. Their great reset
[2:36:13.180 --> 2:36:19.100]  isn't our takeover. It's their fault. So when Schroder had the journalist or he played the
[2:36:19.100 --> 2:36:25.260]  journalist asking college kids, did they think America is the greatest country in the world?
[2:36:25.260 --> 2:36:32.860]  Half of them said no. See, this country is a bunch of mush mouses. We had a stronger generation,
[2:36:32.860 --> 2:36:37.180]  or I did. I don't really know how old you are, but I could tell you're true American.
[2:36:37.820 --> 2:36:43.340]  My father fought Korea, his brother, World War II. These kids, they should be teaching about world
[2:36:43.340 --> 2:36:49.180]  history and how, why they have their freedoms, history in college. Yeah, they don't get their
[2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:53.500]  power is embracing America that's theirs. They're being taught to hate their birthright.
[2:36:53.500 --> 2:36:59.020]  Yeah, I do. I love you. I don't want to see ever.
[2:36:59.020 --> 2:37:02.940]  No, I appreciate you, Charles. Listen, when I get all waxing sad about things,
[2:37:02.940 --> 2:37:08.460]  it's not that I'm being a wimp. It's the opposite of that, brother. I can act powerful all day and
[2:37:08.460 --> 2:37:10.460]  say, I'm gonna do this and that. I'm very sad.
[2:37:12.940 --> 2:37:16.300]  But I'm ready for war and I'm not gonna back down. So don't take,
[2:37:17.260 --> 2:37:21.180]  this thing is, I'm not gonna act tough. Okay. That's already been done before.
[2:37:21.180 --> 2:37:28.860]  Okay. I'm not gonna sit here like John Wayne, just at a movie screen, just act like everything's
[2:37:28.860 --> 2:37:35.340]  not affecting me. No, I've already, already paid a lot. You have no idea. I'm happy to do it.
[2:37:39.180 --> 2:37:41.580]  Don't worry if it's war they want, it's war they'll get.
[2:37:41.580 --> 2:37:52.700]  We're back in a few minutes more of your phone calls to us. So we have free shipping,
[2:37:52.700 --> 2:37:59.740]  double patriot points through this weekend and our big loss leader is X2 in the dropper and in
[2:37:59.740 --> 2:38:05.740]  the spray bottle for 40 and 60% off and your purchase funds the M4. But seriously, the UN admits
[2:38:05.740 --> 2:38:10.380]  two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine. You need to experience
[2:38:10.380 --> 2:38:14.220]  it for yourself, takes two weeks to a month to kick in, try it and tell me what you think.
[2:38:14.220 --> 2:38:19.660]  You can't lose your fun in the M4. And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our
[2:38:19.660 --> 2:38:26.620]  information is dead on from research, I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do without deep breath
[2:38:26.620 --> 2:38:33.100]  crystal iodine and X2. Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible. What it did
[2:38:33.100 --> 2:38:37.900]  for libido is incredible. When I don't take it, I feel the difference. When I do take it, I'm so
[2:38:37.900 --> 2:38:43.900]  empowered. Get your X2 today. Discount in the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take
[2:38:43.900 --> 2:38:48.620]  it under your tongue at infowarstore.com. The globalist hope you don't explore how incredibly
[2:38:48.620 --> 2:38:54.060]  powerful deep breath crystal iodine is. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our
[2:38:54.060 --> 2:38:59.020]  last broadcast. I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But
[2:38:59.020 --> 2:39:03.660]  let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications
[2:39:03.660 --> 2:39:07.660]  are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to
[2:39:07.660 --> 2:39:12.300]  keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[2:39:12.300 --> 2:39:18.940]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt,
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:24.460]  get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:39:24.460 --> 2:39:29.740]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it
[2:39:29.740 --> 2:39:34.940]  if you don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you
[2:39:34.940 --> 2:39:41.340]  can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[2:39:41.340 --> 2:39:46.780]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[2:39:46.780 --> 2:39:51.660]  All of it empowers humanity. All of it is pro-human and pro-god. Thank you so much.
[2:39:53.660 --> 2:39:59.340]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit
[2:39:59.340 --> 2:40:04.140]  to what you're told and it's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians, if you study the
[2:40:04.140 --> 2:40:08.060]  globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta
[2:40:08.060 --> 2:40:11.980]  and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because the globalists
[2:40:11.980 --> 2:40:16.700]  see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And they are collapsing the
[2:40:16.700 --> 2:40:21.340]  third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will
[2:40:21.340 --> 2:40:27.980]  use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN
[2:40:27.980 --> 2:40:31.580]  whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood
[2:40:31.580 --> 2:40:38.060]  of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber
[2:40:38.060 --> 2:40:44.380]  saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates
[2:40:44.380 --> 2:40:50.780]  ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money. And that's why
[2:40:50.780 --> 2:40:57.900]  we have to really get educated about the globalists. We know that the satanic principalities of this
[2:40:57.900 --> 2:41:02.540]  planet want us poisoned. They want to attack our bodies. They want to kill us because we're made
[2:41:02.540 --> 2:41:09.100]  the image of God. But God gave us the components of ourselves, of our bodies to be strong. We've
[2:41:09.100 --> 2:41:13.900]  got everything we need. That's why the globalists hit us with the bad allergens of fluoride,
[2:41:13.900 --> 2:41:18.620]  fluorine, bromide, you name it, instead of iodine, our food, our water, our plants,
[2:41:18.620 --> 2:41:22.620]  everything we eat is deficient and an average person is deficient and it attacks your IQ,
[2:41:22.620 --> 2:41:27.180]  it attacks your stamina and your libido and fertility particularly. Look into it. We have
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:31.500]  the purest iodine you're going to find anywhere on the planet in X2 and it's discounted right now
[2:41:31.500 --> 2:41:35.820]  with free shipping for 40% off in the dropper bottle. We have it for 60% off in the spray bottle.
[2:41:35.820 --> 2:41:38.940]  It's the exact same formula, but I want you to experience it yourself. If you've been on the
[2:41:38.940 --> 2:41:44.300]  fence about iodine, this is the best. Try it today. It takes about 15 days to kick in. It's
[2:41:44.300 --> 2:41:49.660]  exclusively available at mfoldwarestore.com right now and it funds the M4. Only way you fail is not
[2:41:49.660 --> 2:41:58.460]  taking action. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:41:58.460 --> 2:42:17.180]  We are back live on this Thursday, July 8th, transmitting.
[2:42:17.180 --> 2:42:30.780]  Alex, thanks for taking my call. You hear me okay? Yes, sir. Thank you.
[2:42:31.580 --> 2:42:35.660]  All right, great. Well, I just wanted to call and give you a couple of facts. It's very,
[2:42:35.660 --> 2:42:42.300]  very truthful. My dad was stationed at an airport space overseas in Japan
[2:42:42.300 --> 2:42:50.220]  and when I was in middle school, they taught us in seventh grade geography that America was going
[2:42:50.220 --> 2:42:58.060]  to be reformed into different territories and they showed us the FEMA map. This was in 1995,
[2:42:58.060 --> 2:43:12.540]  1996, I believe. That's just the truth. Before the FEMA maps in 1979, in 1936, the New York Times had
[2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:16.940]  those maps as part of a world government. I've got a copy of that somewhere in the office.
[2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:21.580]  That's incredible. Tell us. You were in a government training center and they were
[2:43:21.580 --> 2:43:28.540]  telling you about FEMA takeover. Absolutely. It was in geography class and what was really
[2:43:28.540 --> 2:43:33.100]  strange is when the teacher was showing us the map, it's like he was reading our reactions,
[2:43:33.100 --> 2:43:40.220]  like he was data mining our reactions almost. He showed us and it was very, very strange.
[2:43:40.220 --> 2:43:47.900]  I remember it very clearly. I also want to add now, I have a friend and their grandma, grandpa
[2:43:47.900 --> 2:43:53.180]  and their uncle went and got the COVID shot a few weeks ago. Grandpa died, grandma got a heart
[2:43:53.180 --> 2:44:01.820]  attack and the uncle got a stroke. It's a list of this. I live in Idaho and I work in Washington.
[2:44:01.820 --> 2:44:07.500]  Now, in Washington state, this communist governor, Inslee, put in a new mandate that if you're not
[2:44:07.500 --> 2:44:12.860]  vaccinated, you have to wear a mask. So they're segregating people even more and more and they
[2:44:12.860 --> 2:44:18.780]  got all kinds of signs up at my work. Oh yeah, they're saying we're going to come and rescue
[2:44:18.780 --> 2:44:24.060]  whether it's New Zealand or the US. It's the same thing. Force inoculation. Well, hey,
[2:44:24.060 --> 2:44:30.140]  I'd rather resist them than be dead. What do you think? Oh, absolutely. It's just crazy.
[2:44:31.900 --> 2:44:36.380]  They got people at my church wearing black masks at church. I don't know how these people sleep
[2:44:36.380 --> 2:44:40.300]  at night thinking they're on the right side of anything. It's very, very strange. They're
[2:44:40.300 --> 2:44:43.900]  followers, brother. Just feel sorry for them and try to wake them up.
[2:44:45.500 --> 2:44:51.260]  Totally. I mean, I give people your DVDs and information way back in the day in 2008.
[2:44:51.260 --> 2:44:56.140]  And I have like grown men give it back to me like, hey, I'm divorced. I'm in debt. I can't handle
[2:44:56.140 --> 2:45:02.140]  this information. And that was back in like 2008. And we're just domesticated. And I think
[2:45:02.140 --> 2:45:08.300]  you watch these slaves like your governor, we just showed they're just pretending like they're
[2:45:08.300 --> 2:45:12.700]  in charts. They know they're doing evil. They know they're destroying humanity. Thank you for us.
[2:45:13.500 --> 2:45:20.060]  All right. Up next after you is Jacob. Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead.
[2:45:21.580 --> 2:45:27.420]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep
[2:45:27.420 --> 2:45:32.540]  supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting,
[2:45:32.540 --> 2:45:39.900]  demoralization and absurdity. It's like we're living in the twilight zone. We're living in
[2:45:39.900 --> 2:45:44.060]  the criminal corporate takeover. The big banks have unlimited money and they've got all these
[2:45:44.060 --> 2:45:53.500]  traders. Yeah. Yeah. I can't believe we deal with all this. I also wanted to talk about the
[2:45:53.500 --> 2:45:59.900]  degenerate transgender story time we're dealing. You brought up earlier in how the official San
[2:45:59.900 --> 2:46:05.340]  Francisco choir says, quote, we are going to corrupt your children. We're going to take them
[2:46:05.340 --> 2:46:11.820]  over. We're going to recruit them. We're coming for your children. Yeah. It's unbelievable what we
[2:46:11.820 --> 2:46:17.500]  put up with. And I used to stay up for nights thinking about what I should do to punish these
[2:46:17.500 --> 2:46:24.780]  monsters. And then one night God came to me and I was given a dream. He told me that he would
[2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:31.500]  cleanse the evil and that there was a plan, a timeline. And so I consoled myself with knowing
[2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:37.900]  God's wrath will bring justice and to not take this into our own hands. And all we can do is
[2:46:37.900 --> 2:46:49.100]  lost. I too, Jacob, have been shown that. Wow. And justice, we're filled with rage when we see
[2:46:49.100 --> 2:46:55.420]  transvestites bounce our children on their crotch. God feels rage too. And as long as we're doing
[2:46:55.420 --> 2:47:01.660]  our part to stand against it, God will do his part when it's time. Yeah. It's all these creepy dads
[2:47:02.300 --> 2:47:08.060]  taking their children to similar lab of convicted bettavals. This is so satanic. It's all a big
[2:47:08.060 --> 2:47:13.740]  ritual to ask your children up, show how good you are. And it's just so, it's so sick.
[2:47:13.740 --> 2:47:23.100]  All right. I tune in to your show every day and I'm listening to all of this, all of this crap
[2:47:23.100 --> 2:47:29.980]  going around. And it's demoralizing it. You know, I kind of hope that, you know, maybe we can
[2:47:30.940 --> 2:47:36.220]  be more upbeat when I listen to your show because some days I can't even tune in. It's just,
[2:47:36.220 --> 2:47:40.540]  it's just too much to deal with. No, I hear you, brother. I'm the same way. But, you know,
[2:47:40.540 --> 2:47:46.140]  we're going to put the transmission out and that's the end of it. Thank you. All right. Eric
[2:47:46.140 --> 2:47:50.860]  in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:56.620]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product, one of the product. The X2,
[2:47:56.620 --> 2:48:01.660]  which is on sale right now, does wonders. I recommend it to everybody here on the fence
[2:48:01.660 --> 2:48:06.380]  about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the ample war. We need everybody in
[2:48:06.380 --> 2:48:11.580]  the fight so we can put an end to this madness. No, I agree. Is it not crazy how out they open
[2:48:11.580 --> 2:48:18.860]  it is now? Yes, unbelievable. But the reason I called was Tuesday night, I received a phone
[2:48:18.860 --> 2:48:25.580]  call in what I believe is phase one of Biden's COVID task force plan here from the Centers
[2:48:25.580 --> 2:48:30.860]  for Disease Control wanting to take a survey about my COVID-19 vaccination and any other
[2:48:30.860 --> 2:48:37.740]  vaccination that I may or may not have. Absolutely. This is all about
[2:48:39.180 --> 2:48:43.260]  creating, making you a criminal because their PCR test says you're positive.
[2:48:43.260 --> 2:48:47.980]  It's a perfect way to arrest whoever they want. Yeah. And I think phase two is going to be the
[2:48:47.980 --> 2:48:52.460]  contact tracers knocking at the door and then phase three is probably going to be, you know,
[2:48:52.460 --> 2:48:58.700]  just strike teams or whatever socket you're on it. Well, there's no doubt that's our plan.
[2:48:58.700 --> 2:49:03.580]  This is, they want to arrest their political dissidents. They're going to intubate you and
[2:49:03.580 --> 2:49:12.540]  kill you with a intubation. So that's their plan. Yeah. Well, you asked us a couple of months ago,
[2:49:12.540 --> 2:49:16.060]  Alex, when we were learning about sandwiches and, you know, I just want to put it out there that
[2:49:16.060 --> 2:49:21.660]  my unit is absolutely 100% of the vaccine. I will not be forced inoculated. I will not.
[2:49:21.660 --> 2:49:30.860]  No, I agree with you, brother. And look, when you look at Saki and Biden, they look scared,
[2:49:30.860 --> 2:49:37.340]  brother. These are slaves. So it's intimidating as it says, take heart. They know they're losers.
[2:49:37.340 --> 2:49:43.980]  You understand that? Yes, sir. I think they do too. Oh, they know they're losers, brother.
[2:49:43.980 --> 2:49:52.060]  They're slaves and they're about to execute an operation that will destroy them.
[2:49:52.060 --> 2:49:57.100]  Can you imagine being the FBI when the official national security director was war with all gun
[2:49:57.100 --> 2:50:04.140]  owners, war with all whites, war with all veterans? I mean, it's designed to destroy the FBI and the
[2:50:04.140 --> 2:50:08.380]  police in a war. Then the CHI comes and you and come in. We don't want this civil war,
[2:50:08.380 --> 2:50:11.980]  but they're going to start it. So we're like, Hey, please don't do it. Please stop. Please.
[2:50:11.980 --> 2:50:17.260]  But we're lawyers. We're liberals. We're going to have war with you like Waco,
[2:50:17.260 --> 2:50:23.100]  Waco times a billion, and they're just going to do it. So we're trying to fix it. We're saying,
[2:50:23.100 --> 2:50:28.620]  please stop. But when you're a leftist liberal lawyer with a machine gun, you want to kill
[2:50:28.620 --> 2:50:34.620]  Republicans. You want to taste man flesh. You want to make your bones. And that's what they're
[2:50:34.620 --> 2:50:42.540]  going to do. So they metaphysically need this confrontation. Understand that?
[2:50:44.460 --> 2:50:53.580]  Thank you, Eric. Let's jam in one more right now. Let's talk to Pete in New Jersey. Pete, go ahead.
[2:50:55.820 --> 2:51:01.980]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me? I can. So I'm going to be as concise as possible. Let me,
[2:51:01.980 --> 2:51:05.020]  you know, because this is an important issue, but let me first say why I love you.
[2:51:06.380 --> 2:51:12.540]  About seven years ago, I was introduced through your show to a preacher who actually led me to
[2:51:12.540 --> 2:51:17.420]  Christ. And so now I have eternal life. I'm a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. So I thank you
[2:51:17.420 --> 2:51:23.740]  for that. I'll always love you for that. But I want to talk about this issue of, you know, the LGBT
[2:51:23.740 --> 2:51:30.220]  movement or what the Bible just, you know, satanic cut of all movement. Yep. Yes, exactly. Or what the
[2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:38.780]  Bible just calls sodomite. So I think it's so important that our verbiage as Christians and in
[2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:44.220]  the conservative movement, the patriot movement, what have you, we need to use the verbiage that
[2:51:44.220 --> 2:51:51.660]  the Bible uses because the reason that the Bible uses such fighting language about this issue
[2:51:52.460 --> 2:51:57.900]  and issues such dire warnings, because God knew this is how the attack would come.
[2:51:57.900 --> 2:52:02.460]  I wonder, why is the Bible so upset with gay people? Because it's not gay. It's an attack on
[2:52:02.460 --> 2:52:10.140]  the biology. It's an alien assault. Well, if you look at the first mention of, we find the first
[2:52:10.140 --> 2:52:16.460]  story of a homosexual act in the book of Genesis with, uh, with lot and, you know, or I'm sorry,
[2:52:16.460 --> 2:52:23.180]  with Noah and it's not ham. It's basically someone, um, of, you know, abusing their abuse.
[2:52:23.180 --> 2:52:28.780]  Hello, no, no, no, no, I'll come back to you. And it's not that we hate anybody folks, but humans,
[2:52:28.780 --> 2:52:34.860]  man, woman coming together and splicing humans is a religious act. I mean, this is heavy.
[2:52:34.860 --> 2:52:39.340]  It's just like hydrogen bonds and God doesn't like playing into it.
[2:52:41.100 --> 2:52:45.500]  I never had a marketing plan for him for worse. I went out and found the best products I could
[2:52:45.500 --> 2:52:49.900]  find from the research to fund her operation. I wanted you to get products that empowered you,
[2:52:49.900 --> 2:52:54.140]  that you loved. So you'd want to come back and buy more. I treat you like I want to be treated.
[2:52:54.140 --> 2:52:58.460]  It's very, very simple. It's instinctive. It's spiritual. It's what I do. And that said, our

[2:53:13.660 --> 2:53:17.740]  because of supply chain breakdowns. And so I'm going to catch 22. I need to sell products at

[2:54:45.260 --> 2:54:47.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:54:57.100 --> 2:55:04.220]  All right, Pete, New Jersey, finishing up with a quote gay agenda. It's a dehumanizing agenda,
[2:55:04.220 --> 2:55:08.460]  an anti human agenda. We're not attacking people that are been sucked up in this.
[2:55:10.140 --> 2:55:15.180]  They're saying now in national announcements, your children are ours. We're coming for you. This
[2:55:15.180 --> 2:55:21.420]  is an army. This is a new colonialism. This is a system that's conquering the planet. Even world
[2:55:21.420 --> 2:55:28.620]  leaders are saying that. How do we extricate ourselves from this? Well, the way you it's
[2:55:28.620 --> 2:55:34.060]  basically the Bible says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray
[2:55:34.060 --> 2:55:40.140]  and seek my faith. And then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will
[2:55:40.140 --> 2:55:44.300]  heal their land. So it actually starts with us. It starts with Christians and starts with us getting
[2:55:45.180 --> 2:55:49.900]  sin out of our lives and turning to God and praying. But that's right. We have to receive the
[2:55:49.900 --> 2:55:56.860]  spirit and the transmission of God, not the spirit of the new order. Of course. And so the
[2:55:56.860 --> 2:56:02.780]  reason it's such an issue that pertains to everybody in the world and specifically in,
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:07.580]  you know, the United States of America where this is so pervasive. And it's like it's like the
[2:56:07.580 --> 2:56:13.260]  headquarters of this LGBT agenda being pushed around the world. I mean, even Donald Trump set
[2:56:13.260 --> 2:56:19.980]  off an initiative to basically spread as LGBT propaganda around the world. That was one of his
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:25.740]  his administration's stated goals. And look how they treated it. Well, the Bible says
[2:56:25.740 --> 2:56:31.580]  when a nation is given over to these abominations, there's a spiritual principle that the land
[2:56:31.580 --> 2:56:38.140]  itself will vomit out its inhabitants. So the problem is when we put up with this and when we
[2:56:38.140 --> 2:56:43.020]  just we cower to these bullies and that's what they always are in the Bible. They're bullies
[2:56:43.020 --> 2:56:48.380]  because a man and a woman is a huge ritual of two two different creatures coming together
[2:56:48.380 --> 2:56:54.300]  to create a new entity. This is magic. This is high art. This is the highest thing. You
[2:56:54.300 --> 2:57:00.220]  let things get in the middle of that. You create abomination. Thank you, Pete. Sly in Texas on
[2:57:00.220 --> 2:57:08.460]  the LGBTQ P after kid CDC, they've declared we're coming for your kids to rape them in national TV
[2:57:08.460 --> 2:57:14.860]  shows. Why are they declaring it? What do we do about this, Sly? Well, Alex, God bless you first
[2:57:14.860 --> 2:57:21.900]  and foremost, fantastic callers. I hope I can follow up well. I actually think this might have
[2:57:21.900 --> 2:57:28.620]  to be some kind of sigh up like operation training or something because it's in everybody's faces.
[2:57:28.620 --> 2:57:33.660]  It's everywhere and I've had several gay friends throughout my life and none of the gay people
[2:57:33.660 --> 2:57:41.660]  I know act that way. Hello? I'm right here. Listen to your brother. So what's your view?
[2:57:42.620 --> 2:57:49.820]  Yes, sir. Well, I think it's got to be some kind of sigh up or something because it's in
[2:57:49.820 --> 2:57:54.140]  everybody's faces. It's everywhere. It didn't used to be that way. Well, exactly. They go,
[2:57:54.140 --> 2:58:01.180]  we're the government. We're black. We're gay. It's exactly. It's not the average gay person
[2:58:01.180 --> 2:58:08.860]  that's even pushing all this. What is it? Well, I think I did a good video on this years back.
[2:58:09.580 --> 2:58:15.340]  Everything is inverted. You know, if you spell live backwards, it's evil. It's everything is
[2:58:15.340 --> 2:58:20.380]  the opposite of what it's supposed to be. Our government that's supposed to protect us is
[2:58:20.380 --> 2:58:25.740]  harassing patriots that actually are protecting citizens. The DHS is trying to kill you.
[2:58:26.620 --> 2:58:33.900]  The FDA approves poisons. The church is going along with Satan. This is Satan's time on this
[2:58:33.900 --> 2:58:41.020]  planet to rule. Everything is backwards. And it really is backwards. I mean, all of it is so
[2:58:41.020 --> 2:58:48.940]  transparent, is so ridiculous. Thank you, Sly. All right. Jason and Dixon. Not Mason and Dixon.
[2:58:48.940 --> 2:58:53.900]  It's Jason and Dixon. We're out of time. Give us your number. We'll call you back tomorrow
[2:58:53.900 --> 2:59:00.140]  when I'm on Friday live. But the J. Dyer, great author, great researcher, is about to take over.
[2:59:00.140 --> 2:59:06.460]  Please remember, listeners, it is a revolutionary act to take clips out of the show and share it
[2:59:06.460 --> 2:59:11.020]  on Instagram and Google and YouTube and Twitter. Keep doing it. You're having a huge effect.

[2:59:40.380 --> 2:59:44.940]  or get a Save the Frog T-shirt. Then infowarstore.com. And thanks for keeping us on the air.
[2:59:44.940 --> 2:59:53.660]  It is you that keeps us on the air. Well, all the big box stores are making record profits,
[2:59:53.660 --> 3:00:00.620]  so is Amazon, because they designed the global shutdown to destroy small and medium-sized businesses.
[3:00:01.260 --> 3:00:08.620]  And it is leaking havoc in the supply chain. Thousands and thousands of small companies
[3:00:08.620 --> 3:00:14.940]  have completely shut down. And others are struggling to stay open because they can't get raw materials,
[3:00:14.940 --> 3:00:18.220]  whether it's for food, whether it's for medicine, whether it's for supplements,
[3:00:18.220 --> 3:00:23.740]  whether it's for textiles, whatever the product is, you see it in the news. It is record-level
[3:00:23.740 --> 3:00:28.220]  supply chain breakdowns because the global has shut down the world of comics for more than a year.
[3:00:28.220 --> 3:00:32.620]  And now they're trying to bring the shutdown back again. In fact, areas like India and areas of
[3:00:32.620 --> 3:00:39.340]  Africa, the shutdown is ongoing. It's killing those people in massive numbers. So the info wars
[3:00:39.340 --> 3:00:42.940]  doesn't have a lot of our best selling products anymore for six, seven, eight months. Because of
[3:00:42.940 --> 3:00:47.740]  this, so to make up a short call, please buy T-shirts, books, films, things like that,
[3:00:47.740 --> 3:01:09.180]  and info wars.com. And please try to keep us on the air. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:01:09.180 --> 3:01:15.500]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jason Alton. Alex put out a great documentary this last week,
[3:01:15.500 --> 3:01:22.220]  a little mini documentary about three evil sites in New York. And one of those sites relates to
[3:01:28.060 --> 3:01:35.100]  books of the elite. That is the writings of the elite themselves that go into great detail as to
[3:01:35.100 --> 3:01:40.140]  how they would conduct the next phase of their business plan to bring in the technocratic
[3:01:40.140 --> 3:01:47.100]  global order. Of course, the magnum opus of that is Tragedy and Hope by Carol Quigley. But a lot
[3:01:47.100 --> 3:01:53.500]  of people don't know that Quigley wrote another book. He was the professor at Georgetown, the
[3:01:53.500 --> 3:01:59.420]  military historian archivist for the CFR. His book Tragedy and Hope, of course, was given to CIA
[3:01:59.420 --> 3:02:06.300]  operatives back in the 70s, 60s, Cold War era to help them understand why would we as Western powers
[3:02:06.300 --> 3:02:12.380]  be aiding at times communists? Doesn't that seem to go against the logic of the Cold War?
[3:02:13.260 --> 3:02:19.100]  And so the apologetic of Tragedy and Hope is geared towards explaining a lot of these kinds
[3:02:19.100 --> 3:02:25.260]  of seeming contradictions in the Western approach to the Cold War. And as we all know, Quigley's
[3:02:25.260 --> 3:02:31.740]  whole thesis is that the tragedies were the two World Wars and the Cold War. And the hope was
[3:02:31.740 --> 3:02:40.300]  Western globalist capitalist democracy. Of course, capitalist there means neo-liberalism in the sense
[3:02:40.300 --> 3:02:48.140]  of crony capitalism in the sense of top-down control corporatism. So we're not talking about
[3:02:48.140 --> 3:02:55.180]  the older free market model. We're talking about the control of the oligarchs. But what a lot of
[3:02:55.180 --> 3:02:59.340]  people don't know is that Quigley wrote another important book. In ways, it was more important
[3:02:59.340 --> 3:03:05.180]  than Tragedy and Hope due to a lot of the details that he spilled in terms of who actually ran
[3:03:05.180 --> 3:03:11.340]  the global government. So while Tragedy and Hope gives you this 1300-page history and
[3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:17.580]  kind of apologetic defense of what was going on and why the elite engineered the two World Wars
[3:03:17.580 --> 3:03:23.580]  and the Cold War, the Anglo-American establishment tells you who's behind it.
[3:03:23.580 --> 3:03:29.020]  So we're going to be going through some of this forgotten classic here, the Anglo-American
[3:03:29.020 --> 3:03:36.140]  establishment. And again, it parallels very well with Alex's documentary. So Quigley starts
[3:03:36.140 --> 3:03:42.060]  up by talking about in the early phases of the British, excuse me, of the 20th century,
[3:03:42.060 --> 3:03:48.620]  by about 1920s, the British Empire had come up with a plan that they called the Commonwealth
[3:03:48.620 --> 3:03:53.980]  of Nations. And so this is where we get Chatham houses, where we get the Clived and Set. We get
[3:03:53.980 --> 3:04:01.340]  these sort of circles of elites and lords who said, all right, look, the British Empire represents
[3:04:01.340 --> 3:04:07.100]  the greatest ascent in human evolution, quite literally. They thought that it was the apex
[3:04:07.100 --> 3:04:12.620]  of evolutionary ascent. And this is tied in, of course, with Darwinism or the adoption of the
[3:04:12.620 --> 3:04:19.420]  Darwinistic religion, really. If you read what Darwinism actually is, it goes back to ancient
[3:04:19.420 --> 3:04:24.620]  Hinduism. You can see then, of course, the British preference for the Hindu caste system,
[3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:31.180]  if it meshes perfectly with the Darwinian social Darwinian perspective of how to
[3:04:31.180 --> 3:04:38.060]  structure society in this way. And so Quigley points out certain figures and thinkers who were
[3:04:38.060 --> 3:04:43.820]  kind of the ideologues. There's John Ruskin, who thought that we should instantiate a global
[3:04:43.820 --> 3:04:49.180]  socialism under the British Empire. There's Toynbee. There's H.G. Wells, right, these different
[3:04:49.180 --> 3:04:54.460]  thinkers who said, let's divide up the world and put it under the ages of the British Empire.
[3:04:56.300 --> 3:05:00.940]  In fact, Toynbee would be the key to giving us the ideology or giving them the ideology, I should
[3:05:00.940 --> 3:05:08.540]  say. And by 1938, through this secret society at Oxford, Cambridge, and other schools, through the
[3:05:08.540 --> 3:05:17.980]  support of banking elites like the Morgan's, the Rothschilds, the Rhodes Trust, the Byte Trust,
[3:05:18.540 --> 3:05:25.580]  Lazard Brothers and Company, they had essentially taken over the entire intellectual apparatus of
[3:05:25.580 --> 3:05:31.740]  the British Empire. So this was the dominant force by that time, by the 30s and 40s. We can see
[3:05:31.740 --> 3:05:35.820]  that this will lead to, of course, not just the creation of the League of Nations earlier than
[3:05:35.820 --> 3:05:40.620]  that, but it will even lead to the creation of the United Nations by the same power structure,
[3:05:40.620 --> 3:05:47.420]  because they're allied with the Rockefeller power structure, the J.P. Morgan-Mellon Carnegie
[3:05:47.420 --> 3:05:53.420]  Trust in the U.S. They're linked together. But Quigley goes on to talk about the fact that
[3:05:53.420 --> 3:06:00.620]  by the 1920s, 30s, 40s, they had not just controlled the universities in the U.K., but that they'd
[3:06:00.620 --> 3:06:06.140]  also gain control of the Church of England. The whole Anglican apparatus, which was always kind
[3:06:06.140 --> 3:06:15.180]  of a tool of the British crown all the way back to Henry VIII, they had co-opted the ministers
[3:06:15.180 --> 3:06:20.940]  in the Church. And this is paradigmatic for the way it works now. Remember that this is not
[3:06:20.940 --> 3:06:26.780]  different. This superstructure, this octopus operates the exact same way now. They do the exact
[3:06:26.780 --> 3:06:34.540]  same thing where they co-opt and buy off churches and religions to be the arms of this global
[3:06:34.540 --> 3:06:40.060]  technocratic order. Now, it's true that we're not under the old British imperial system anymore,
[3:06:40.780 --> 3:06:47.260]  but what the Pax Americana became, as we'll see here in a little bit, was laid out by these
[3:06:47.260 --> 3:06:54.460]  royal society strategists. Now, the royals also bird this steering committee idea of the Royal
[3:06:54.460 --> 3:06:58.380]  Institute for International Affairs. And this is the Milner group and all the same people involved
[3:06:58.380 --> 3:07:04.460]  in what I'm talking about now. They set up this idea of, let's have a modern kind of round table
[3:07:04.460 --> 3:07:12.060]  of knights or elites who will steer the globe into the liberal world order. Now, you think, well,
[3:07:12.060 --> 3:07:17.660]  doesn't that sound good? Don't we want a free world order where everybody can freely exchange
[3:07:17.660 --> 3:07:22.460]  ideas and goods and it's a free market? No, no, that's not what it means. You have to understand
[3:07:22.460 --> 3:07:27.020]  that this is an inversion. Most of the time when you see them saying that kind of stuff,
[3:07:27.020 --> 3:07:32.860]  it actually means the opposite. Now, they were at this time in the 20s and 30s, if you read
[3:07:33.500 --> 3:07:39.660]  Lord Birkenhead's famous essay in Cosmopolitan, they had already bird the idea of a technocracy.
[3:07:39.660 --> 3:07:47.020]  Yes, this early, back in the 1910s, 20s, 30s, people like H.T. Wells were already kind of forming
[3:07:47.020 --> 3:07:52.460]  the future projections. Everybody knows about Huxley and Brave New World for this group. So,
[3:07:52.460 --> 3:07:58.940]  you have to understand it is this group that is the Illuminati, so to speak, 100 years ago. And
[3:07:58.940 --> 3:08:03.740]  we're going to get into who makes up this group, what the actual structure of this group was,
[3:08:03.740 --> 3:08:09.100]  how it functioned, how they recruited people. It's all in this book, by the way. Now, keep in
[3:08:09.100 --> 3:08:16.460]  mind that Cecil Rhodes was, of course, the famous Freemason, and he is sort of the front man at that
[3:08:16.460 --> 3:08:21.580]  time for this conspiracy. You could think of him like the clout swab of his day. Now, certainly,
[3:08:21.580 --> 3:08:27.260]  Cecil Rhodes was a wealthy, powerful man, but he was more or less, according to biographers of him,
[3:08:27.260 --> 3:08:33.420]  John Roberts has a famous biography, essentially an agent of the Rothschilds. So, Cecil Rhodes is
[3:08:33.420 --> 3:08:40.940]  nothing more than a front man, a kind of operator, like Rhodes or like a swab or gate, to essentially
[3:08:40.940 --> 3:08:46.940]  set up these kinds of structures in other countries. So, they ran a lot of experiments in Africa
[3:08:46.940 --> 3:08:51.820]  through the Rhodes Trust and through how they would structure people in terms of camps,
[3:08:52.460 --> 3:08:57.980]  right, the diamond mines. That's all what was going on in Africa under this structure of the
[3:08:57.980 --> 3:09:04.700]  British Empire. Other famous lords would be people like Lord Halford MacKinder, Lord Curtis,
[3:09:04.700 --> 3:09:11.900]  Lord Lionel Curtis, and they hatched this plan, get this, the second chapter of Quigley's book
[3:09:13.180 --> 3:09:19.260]  deals with how to infiltrate and co-opt all areas of society. Now, this is 100 years ago.
[3:09:19.900 --> 3:09:25.020]  We're not talking about speculating, use their conspiracy today. Well, I don't know, maybe.
[3:09:25.020 --> 3:09:31.900]  Now, we're talking about 100 years ago. They openly talked about it, okay. They came up with
[3:09:31.900 --> 3:09:38.620]  what they called a triple point plan. The triple point plan as hatched by Lord Rothschild and
[3:09:38.620 --> 3:09:46.220]  Cecil Rhodes would be to get into every area of public life, mainly education, media, and politics.
[3:09:46.780 --> 3:09:52.620]  If they could control education, media, and politics, and if they could voice that same model
[3:09:52.620 --> 3:10:00.540]  in other countries, then the Commonwealth of God model of the British Empire could be a truly
[3:10:00.540 --> 3:10:07.740]  global government, okay. So, again, remember, the global government plan was hatched over 100 years
[3:10:07.740 --> 3:10:13.180]  ago. Now, yes, there were globalists prior to that. The Jacobins were globalists. Immanuel
[3:10:13.180 --> 3:10:17.740]  Caunt wrote a famous essay calling for globalism. And every empire in the history of the world was,
[3:10:17.740 --> 3:10:23.260]  in some degree, globalist, right. But the modern New World Order that we always talk about, it comes
[3:10:23.260 --> 3:10:30.620]  from this. This is a crucial book that outlines the whole superstructure, the strategy, the infiltration,
[3:10:30.620 --> 3:10:37.500]  co-opting every area of society. And ultimately, yes, to bring in a technocracy. And you have to
[3:10:37.500 --> 3:10:42.540]  read. Just go look it up online. It's called Lord Birkenhead's essay in Cosmopolitan Magazine.
[3:10:42.540 --> 3:10:49.500]  I think it was 1919 or 1920. Way ahead of time. So, you're right there. This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:10:49.500 --> 3:10:55.260]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone for beta
[3:10:55.260 --> 3:11:00.620]  testing to operational. The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation
[3:11:00.620 --> 3:11:05.500]  takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is, we've been working and you've been working,
[3:11:05.500 --> 3:11:09.260]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[3:11:09.260 --> 3:11:13.900]  to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the
[3:11:13.900 --> 3:11:17.980]  attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance,
[3:11:17.980 --> 3:11:22.540]  we will defeat it. So, prayer is essential. Research is essential. Getting prepared is
[3:11:22.540 --> 3:11:27.260]  essential. And warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting
[3:11:27.260 --> 3:11:31.740]  Info Wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great

[3:13:11.980 --> 3:13:16.220]  Welcome back to the Outstanding Show on your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.

[3:13:22.220 --> 3:13:25.180]  We won't be here unless you support the work that we're doing.
[3:13:25.900 --> 3:13:31.900]  Now, we were talking about the technocratic plans that were already in play back in the
[3:13:31.900 --> 3:13:37.180]  teens and 20s on the part of the British Empire, the British Commonwealth. In fact,
[3:13:37.180 --> 3:13:40.700]  one of these characters who was one of the key architects of the League of Nations,
[3:13:40.700 --> 3:13:46.060]  which was the sort of nascent plan for global government at that time, was Lord Robert Cecil.
[3:13:46.060 --> 3:13:51.260]  And he was given the Nobel Prize, which is interesting. So I think we could even speculate
[3:13:51.260 --> 3:13:57.180]  that the Nobel Prize was a kind of propaganda joke all the way back then, right? Because we know that
[3:13:57.180 --> 3:14:02.620]  the League of Nations wasn't really about creating a peaceful world order. It was a
[3:14:02.620 --> 3:14:08.780]  monetarist plan to restructure the world and get it into debt. And that's the key thing here,
[3:14:08.780 --> 3:14:13.820]  especially if you read Tragedy and Hope. When the bankers have these big Yalta meetings,
[3:14:13.820 --> 3:14:18.940]  Marshall Plan meetings, when they have these big meetings to settle the post-war era,
[3:14:18.940 --> 3:14:24.300]  it's really to get the future generations into infinite debt. That's why all these countries
[3:14:24.300 --> 3:14:31.260]  have huge deficits, right? All the wars, oh, we still owe, right? The banking elites for World War
[3:14:31.260 --> 3:14:36.780]  II. So you're in debt for the next several generations. And that's really the ultimate
[3:14:36.780 --> 3:14:44.060]  long-term goal of why wars are so beneficial to banking elites. And in fact, even famous generals,
[3:14:44.060 --> 3:14:49.820]  right? General Smedley Butler realized this, that war is a racket. It's merely a kind of
[3:14:49.820 --> 3:14:56.460]  business plan for extremely wealthy people. So the League of Nations, of course, was the
[3:14:56.460 --> 3:15:00.940]  brainchild of the Royal Institute for International Affairs. As we said, we were talking about how
[3:15:00.940 --> 3:15:07.340]  they had come up with this triple threat plan to infiltrate the three areas of society, media,
[3:15:07.980 --> 3:15:15.900]  education, and politics. So even at that time, they had figured out that let's just have puppet
[3:15:15.900 --> 3:15:21.100]  politicians, right? We don't really have to worry about what they say in terms of their policies.
[3:15:21.100 --> 3:15:26.220]  You let them yap and say what they want. We'll just buy them off. And if you print the money,
[3:15:26.220 --> 3:15:33.420]  you control the printing press, right, through the Fiat Federal Reserve Banking System, which the
[3:15:33.420 --> 3:15:38.060]  Bank of England was one of those Fiat Federal Reserve private banking systems, right? You can
[3:15:38.060 --> 3:15:41.660]  control the politicians. You can print as much money as you want, buy off whoever you want.
[3:15:43.420 --> 3:15:47.900]  But as they began to infiltrate the education system and specifically higher education, the
[3:15:47.900 --> 3:15:56.460]  elite universities, one of the things they did was recruit from Oxford, Cambridge, All Souls, etc.
[3:15:57.340 --> 3:16:02.540]  And that's what's going on in the UK, right? There was similar patterns, remember, in New York,
[3:16:02.540 --> 3:16:08.620]  when Chatham House is set up, Pratt House is set up, you've got the same model going on in the US,
[3:16:08.620 --> 3:16:15.500]  and this is why the US elite set up similar steering committees, right? You get CFR. You get
[3:16:15.500 --> 3:16:20.220]  trilateral commission. You get the Institute for Pacific Relations by, you know, David Rockfield,
[3:16:20.220 --> 3:16:25.100]  right? These are the same models, the same strategies and plans being done on both sides
[3:16:25.980 --> 3:16:33.500]  of both continents. So when they had converted enough, the Anglican ministers, when they had
[3:16:33.500 --> 3:16:38.140]  converted enough of the technocratic, excuse me, the educational elite,
[3:16:38.140 --> 3:16:48.300]  then it became a situation where they wanted to call it literally a secret society. And,
[3:16:48.300 --> 3:16:52.860]  believe it or not, this is not, again, this is not a conspiracy book. This is a classic
[3:16:52.860 --> 3:16:59.180]  tone of geopolitics, okay? Not conspiracy, just the history of geopolitical intrigues
[3:16:59.180 --> 3:17:05.660]  by a military historian. And the third chapter is called The Secret Society of Cecil Rhodes,
[3:17:05.660 --> 3:17:11.980]  right? And they said, well, we'll just recruit people into this by giving them scholarships.
[3:17:12.940 --> 3:17:20.220]  So the next generation of the intellectual elite will give them free scholarships,
[3:17:20.220 --> 3:17:25.260]  and that's how we'll just control everything. And we'll have the key seats in the universities
[3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:31.180]  chaired by people that are part of our system. Now, you think, well, how could they pull this
[3:17:31.180 --> 3:17:37.980]  off? How could they do this? Well, they had a structure. And in fact, Quigley explains and lists
[3:17:37.980 --> 3:17:45.180]  the structure. Now, the first thing that will probably surprise you is that they chose the
[3:17:45.180 --> 3:17:51.740]  Jesuit order as the model for how to structure the society. Now, that doesn't mean that the
[3:17:51.740 --> 3:17:57.340]  Jesuits run the New World Order. The Jesuits play a role. The Jesuits have for a long time,
[3:17:57.340 --> 3:18:03.980]  right? Been agents of globalism, been agents of and connected to the CIA. That's well established,
[3:18:03.980 --> 3:18:09.340]  well documented. And so they play a role, but I don't think the Jesuits as an order are at the
[3:18:09.340 --> 3:18:14.460]  top of the pyramid, but they certainly play an important role in globalism. In fact, Jesuits were
[3:18:14.460 --> 3:18:20.300]  the great evangelizers of Darwinism across the world. So in a way, they were kind of helping
[3:18:20.300 --> 3:18:26.940]  the British Empire and spreading the myth of the Darwinian ethos that the British Empire was the
[3:18:26.940 --> 3:18:34.300]  apex of human evolution. But Quigley notes that the structure that Cecil came up with
[3:18:34.940 --> 3:18:39.420]  and Rhodes, excuse me, Cecil Rhodes and the Rockefeller, the Rothschilds came up with
[3:18:40.140 --> 3:18:48.060]  would be modeled on the Jesuit structure. So as you know, right, there's a secret black pope
[3:18:48.060 --> 3:18:51.580]  amongst the, who's the head of the Jesuits, and he's called the black pope because he's
[3:18:51.580 --> 3:18:56.380]  typically had quite a bit of power in the Roman Catholic super structure, right? He may not be
[3:18:56.380 --> 3:19:02.220]  the pope in Rome, but he's kind of a secret order or secret head within the Roman Catholic structure,
[3:19:02.220 --> 3:19:07.980]  and we've seen, of course, this come to the fore in the last few years through the stepping down
[3:19:07.980 --> 3:19:14.300]  of Benedict and the rise of Bergoglio, right, who was a Jesuit. But what's interesting is that on
[3:19:14.300 --> 3:19:23.340]  page 33 Quigley says that Rhodes and Rothschild hatched a plan to bring America back under the
[3:19:23.340 --> 3:19:32.060]  sway of the British Imperium. This is crucial. This is why America changed so much throughout
[3:19:32.060 --> 3:19:37.820]  the 20th century. Everybody knows, of course, the founding fathers had a very non-interventionist,
[3:19:37.820 --> 3:19:45.020]  right, stay out of the European wars attitude. Why was that? Well, the founding fathers knew
[3:19:45.020 --> 3:19:49.820]  that this would entangle the U.S. back in all of those conflicts that would lead to,
[3:19:49.820 --> 3:19:56.060]  that would tempt the United States into stepping in as a policeman of the world,
[3:19:56.060 --> 3:20:02.540]  as a global actor, as a new Imperium. And as we will see, that's exactly what happened. We even
[3:20:02.540 --> 3:20:07.340]  know who did it. We know all the people. We know the British agents who came over and set up the
[3:20:07.340 --> 3:20:21.980]  OSS and CIA. It was all done as planned by Rhodes and Rothschild. We must bring the Union. Now,
[3:20:21.980 --> 3:20:27.420]  it didn't exactly work out as they hoped because, as we know, throughout the 20th century, the British
[3:20:27.420 --> 3:20:34.700]  Empire eventually kind of goes bankrupt, fades away, but it prepares the way for the Pax Americana.
[3:20:34.700 --> 3:20:38.780]  So the elites that ran Britain, okay, we're not talking about the British people. We're talking
[3:20:38.780 --> 3:20:46.140]  about the Royal Society, the RIAA, the milliner group, these people working with the Rothschilds.
[3:20:46.140 --> 3:20:53.420]  Those are the people who said, I know, who cares about the Brit Empire? We'll just rebrand this
[3:20:53.420 --> 3:21:00.860]  as the American Imperium. And we'll set up a secret structure. This is the inner party.
[3:21:00.860 --> 3:21:09.020]  When Orwell talks about an inner party and an outer party, this is it. And you say,
[3:21:09.020 --> 3:21:12.540]  but wait a minute, how can socialism be compatible with all this? Wasn't Orwell
[3:21:12.540 --> 3:21:19.500]  talking about Ingsoc, English socialism? Yes, Orwell is telling you that they control the elite,
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:24.460]  control both sides of this. It doesn't matter whether it's capitalist or whether it's socialist
[3:21:24.460 --> 3:21:31.420]  or communist, the elite families are above that dialectical fray. Now, there's really people
[3:21:31.420 --> 3:21:37.180]  fighting it out between those two sides, but the super rich, they're above that, and they will fund
[3:21:37.180 --> 3:21:43.020]  both sides of that conflict. When we get into the next section, I'm going to show you, according
[3:21:43.020 --> 3:21:48.460]  to Quigley, the actual structure of the actual inner party, Illuminati. This is the OJ Jones
[3:21:48.460 --> 3:21:52.860]  show. Don't go anywhere. You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes
[3:21:52.860 --> 3:21:59.580]  me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial
[3:21:59.580 --> 3:22:04.700]  support, and for word of mouth. And then we're all in this together. And you know, it gets old
[3:22:04.700 --> 3:22:07.980]  having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on
[3:22:07.980 --> 3:22:11.740]  air. But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes
[3:22:11.740 --> 3:22:16.700]  liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and
[3:22:16.700 --> 3:22:20.780]  almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups. And we're still here. And as
[3:22:20.780 --> 3:22:25.740]  this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got
[3:22:25.740 --> 3:22:29.500]  to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other
[3:22:29.500 --> 3:22:34.620]  nations as slaves. And America is still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven
[3:22:34.620 --> 3:22:38.780]  right. Be it on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think
[3:22:38.780 --> 3:22:43.980]  stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com. Get some great 2020

[3:23:48.700 --> 3:23:55.580]  bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[3:23:55.580 --> 3:24:00.060]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[3:24:00.060 --> 3:24:05.100]  and degrade targeted pollutants. For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public
[3:24:05.100 --> 3:24:10.140]  market a suite of bio remediation products to the everyday consumer. Their first product they are

[3:24:55.180 --> 3:24:59.500]  want us poisoned. They want to attack our bodies. They want to kill us because we're made the image
[3:24:59.500 --> 3:25:06.780]  of God. But God gave us the components of ourselves of our bodies to be strong. We've got everything
[3:25:06.780 --> 3:25:11.580]  we need. That's why the globalists hit us with the bad halogens of fluoride, fluorine bromide,
[3:25:11.580 --> 3:25:16.460]  you name it, instead of iodine. Our food, our water, our plants, everything we eat is deficient
[3:25:16.460 --> 3:25:21.500]  and the average person is deficient and it attacks your IQ, it attacks your stamina and your libido
[3:25:21.500 --> 3:25:25.500]  and fertility particularly. Look into it. We have the purest iodine you're going to find anywhere
[3:25:25.500 --> 3:25:30.220]  on the planet in X2 and it's discounted right now with free shipping for 40% off in the dropper

[3:26:15.100 --> 3:26:23.740]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. We want
[3:26:23.740 --> 3:26:30.060]  signed copies of my book that breaks down a lot of this material through the lens of Hollywood
[3:26:30.060 --> 3:26:36.140]  and pop culture. Go to Jay's Analysis and then to shop. You can find signed copies. You can also
[3:26:36.140 --> 3:26:41.980]  subscribe to my website. Get access to the last five years of my lectures that deal with these
[3:26:41.980 --> 3:26:49.180]  very topics. Now we were talking about the Rhodes Milner Rothschild plan to utilize the secret
[3:26:49.180 --> 3:26:54.620]  society inner structure like that of the Jesuits and in fact they even went so far as to say that
[3:26:54.620 --> 3:27:01.260]  we would like to see the English Imperium supplant and take over the Roman Catholic religion. So
[3:27:01.260 --> 3:27:06.780]  they actually wanted something modeled on the Vatican and the Roman Catholic superstructure
[3:27:06.780 --> 3:27:14.060]  to supplant and take over what that church or that group represented. Hence again the plan
[3:27:14.060 --> 3:27:18.940]  to model it after the Jesuits. And one example by the way that quickly gets into of the controlled
[3:27:18.940 --> 3:27:25.420]  chaos divide and conquer strategy was that he mentions the Rothschild support of the Boer War.
[3:27:25.420 --> 3:27:30.220]  That was actually a plan of the British Empire to foster chaos and destruction in that region
[3:27:30.220 --> 3:27:35.180]  so that they could come in and have the monopoly on the diamond mining. One other point I would
[3:27:35.180 --> 3:27:42.620]  add too is that this is not divorced from the esoteric. As we said of course Cecil Rose was a
[3:27:42.620 --> 3:27:48.700]  fairly high level Freemason 32 or 33rd degree if I remember correctly. But a big part of the
[3:27:49.980 --> 3:27:59.580]  religious arm of the Anglo-American establishment was the Society for Psychical Research and this
[3:27:59.580 --> 3:28:08.780]  was founded by many of the members of the Balfour group, the Milner group and the RIIA. And what
[3:28:08.780 --> 3:28:15.180]  they wanted to do was utilize a kind of religion that they could come up with that they thought
[3:28:15.180 --> 3:28:21.660]  would be maybe modeled after psychicalism or mesmerism that was very popular at this time.
[3:28:21.660 --> 3:28:30.700]  And they were hoping to tap into some kind of literally pre-New Age philosophy and esoteric
[3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:36.780]  system that they could use as a kind of global religion. Yes on page 32
[3:28:38.220 --> 3:28:43.020]  Quigley talks about how they hoped that they could tap into something that could be a potential
[3:28:43.980 --> 3:28:49.340]  global religion that they could run and control. Again they had already the Church of England,
[3:28:49.340 --> 3:28:54.300]  they had other groups that they had co-opted and eventually I believe they co-opted the Jesuits
[3:28:54.300 --> 3:28:58.940]  even though they modeled themselves on it. Eventually this elite the same power structure
[3:28:58.940 --> 3:29:04.060]  which is more or less kind of what runs things today even though all these people are dead and
[3:29:04.060 --> 3:29:11.020]  gone their successors run things today. Now here's the structure that Quigley gets into. He says,
[3:29:11.020 --> 3:29:17.100]  all right Rosso came up with this idea for the Society of the Elect and this is the
[3:29:17.100 --> 3:29:22.700]  secret society inner core that I was mentioning with Cecil Rhodes. That's what the chapter is
[3:29:22.700 --> 3:29:28.780]  talking about the secret society of Cecil Rhodes. This inner core would be the top elites amongst
[3:29:28.780 --> 3:29:36.780]  the families lords right and so it's listed at this time I think back in the 1890s into the early
[3:29:37.340 --> 3:29:46.140]  1900s. This is the society as drawn up in 1891 so notice this secret society was already structured
[3:29:46.140 --> 3:29:53.660]  in 1891. The head of this society would be Rothschild's and Rhodes right so Rothschild's
[3:29:53.660 --> 3:29:59.100]  will be kind of the funder that the money behind it and then the general of this order would be
[3:29:59.100 --> 3:30:06.140]  Cecil Rhodes. Underneath him would be Lord Stead Lord Brett and Lord Milner. Under them would be a
[3:30:06.140 --> 3:30:14.380]  circle of initiates called well namely Cardinal Manning so here we have a Roman Catholic who's
[3:30:14.380 --> 3:30:21.820]  part of this society structure already at this time. A surprising figure general Booth of the
[3:30:21.820 --> 3:30:28.300]  Salvation Army that's an odd one. Some other lords in this including Lord Gray and Lord Balfour
[3:30:29.180 --> 3:30:32.860]  and of course we all know about Balfour Declaration you can see why that plays into
[3:30:32.860 --> 3:30:39.100]  this British imperial strategy as well and then outside of these elect would be what they call
[3:30:39.100 --> 3:30:47.900]  the helpers. The society of helpers. Yes so what is the society of helpers? This is the thousands
[3:30:49.580 --> 3:30:57.180]  of academic elites that they would recruit at the universities the doofs the idiots and the
[3:30:57.180 --> 3:31:03.740]  patsies who thought that they would be benefiting from this global government. This was in the 1890s
[3:31:03.740 --> 3:31:10.940]  you see that they had they had set up this plan to create at that time that's a different society
[3:31:10.940 --> 3:31:18.940]  of helpers. This is the inner core of the society of helpers that Rothschild and Rhodes had set up
[3:31:18.940 --> 3:31:25.580]  that was basically just Cambridge Oxford elites. So a lot of academic people thought oh you know
[3:31:25.580 --> 3:31:32.460]  we're being brought into this this great plan of you know Cecil Rhodes and Lord Rothschild and Lord
[3:31:32.460 --> 3:31:37.740]  Johnston and Lord Stead and Lord Brett Lord Milner and they're going to set up a great free
[3:31:38.380 --> 3:31:43.020]  democratic global government and they literally called it the commonwealth of God that's what
[3:31:43.020 --> 3:31:48.380]  they thought at that time would be a good kind of spin well if we call it the commonwealth of God
[3:31:49.500 --> 3:31:52.780]  then everybody will believe in it because who wants to go against God right I mean it was
[3:31:52.780 --> 3:31:59.100]  literally that dumb but it apparently worked pretty well because although this didn't achieve
[3:31:59.100 --> 3:32:05.420]  the actual global government in their day it did lay the plans and the strategies for what would
[3:32:05.420 --> 3:32:10.460]  become the global government eventually that we're now dealing with that's the key here is that
[3:32:10.460 --> 3:32:16.700]  we are dealing with what this was planning a hundred years ago this group. Also obviously
[3:32:16.700 --> 3:32:20.620]  important to this would be the intelligence networks and Quigley covers this in this same
[3:32:20.620 --> 3:32:27.260]  chapter that that really this society of helpers functions like a kind of British intelligence
[3:32:27.260 --> 3:32:32.620]  network and that's really what it was there's another famous historian Jessica Harlan Jacobs
[3:32:32.620 --> 3:32:38.700]  who wrote a book about the builders of the empire and that book is a history of the British empire's
[3:32:38.700 --> 3:32:45.420]  usage of the freemasonic lodges and her thesis is just basically that really the British empire
[3:32:45.420 --> 3:32:49.820]  used Freemasonry as a kind of intelligence network that's all it was if you've never seen
[3:32:49.820 --> 3:32:56.620]  the movie the man who would be king with Sean Conrad, go watch the man who would be king and
[3:32:56.620 --> 3:33:00.300]  you will see exactly what I'm talking about because those two scallywags are basically
[3:33:00.300 --> 3:33:06.140]  British intelligence spies and they just romp around Europe and go into I think again the
[3:33:06.140 --> 3:33:12.060]  Himalayas or somewhere and they set up a cult right so and Sean Conrad passes himself off as
[3:33:12.060 --> 3:33:17.980]  the reincarnation of Alexander the Great. It's a good insight into the Masonic philosophy and how
[3:33:17.980 --> 3:33:24.700]  the British empire used this kind of intelligence apparatus but the idea was of course that there
[3:33:24.700 --> 3:33:29.100]  would be a global government that would set up that would be liberal that would be using the name
[3:33:29.100 --> 3:33:35.020]  God the commonwealth of God and Cecil Rose says well we're just going to buy everybody off
[3:33:35.020 --> 3:33:40.060]  Lord Milner says we're going to use mass of the propaganda and then Milner said let's set up a
[3:33:40.060 --> 3:33:46.460]  giant welfare system this was a key point here Lord Milner said if we can if we can have everybody
[3:33:46.460 --> 3:33:55.900]  on a dole right so they're implementing elements of socialism as well as elements of big banking
[3:33:55.900 --> 3:34:01.900]  capitalism right monopoly capitalism usury is a big part of the system by the way then they
[3:34:01.900 --> 3:34:07.900]  thought they could combine these into a perfect technocratic order what do we see nowadays with
[3:34:07.900 --> 3:34:14.140]  China right China says we are the apex of the blending of communism and capitalism into the
[3:34:14.140 --> 3:34:20.860]  perfect system that's nothing new that's all that's what what John Ruskin and these people were posing
[3:34:20.860 --> 3:34:25.980]  a hundred years ago was that model and in fact they even noted and what's the chapter that's
[3:34:25.980 --> 3:34:31.980]  called Milner's kindergarten this is Lord Milner's plan to set up these educational brainwashing
[3:34:31.980 --> 3:34:39.340]  centers to brainwash people into this that basically the state is God we will create a liberal
[3:34:39.340 --> 3:34:48.380]  imperium a liberal order in a liberal league and they even called it liberal imperialism
[3:34:49.500 --> 3:34:56.620]  that Lord Gray formed the liberal league which was based on liberal imperialism
[3:34:57.420 --> 3:35:02.700]  with Lord Milner closely associated with it then of course they bought off people in other
[3:35:02.700 --> 3:35:08.460]  churches the church of Scotland right the church of then they brought in Canada forgot to mention
[3:35:08.460 --> 3:35:13.420]  it so Canada plays a key role in this so Canada was obviously co-opted as one of the common wells
[3:35:13.420 --> 3:35:18.460]  brought into this superstructure and it will actually be an important Canadian intelligence
[3:35:18.460 --> 3:35:26.860]  asset who will play a key role in bringing the US into this power structure the Dawes plan was
[3:35:26.860 --> 3:35:33.260]  drawn up by the banks and that would be another key choke point to bring people into this debt
[3:35:33.260 --> 3:35:41.020]  based banking order Lord Curtis is the one as I said who came up with this idea to transition
[3:35:41.020 --> 3:35:47.100]  the British Empire into the liberal commonwealth of God so when we come back we'll see some more
[3:35:47.100 --> 3:35:51.820]  of this and how it transitions the US. We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever
[3:35:51.820 --> 3:35:58.460]  Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com. Kava is one of the hottest
[3:35:58.460 --> 3:36:03.500]  new breakthroughs in the natural health world today though it has been used for hundreds of years
[3:36:03.500 --> 3:36:09.100]  in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan
[3:36:09.100 --> 3:36:15.260]  legend Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa who they considered to be the supreme
[3:36:15.260 --> 3:36:21.020]  ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[3:36:21.020 --> 3:36:26.460]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many
[3:36:26.460 --> 3:36:32.460]  who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend

[3:36:45.740 --> 3:36:53.820]  visiting InfoWarsStore.com. The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist
[3:36:53.820 --> 3:36:59.500]  paradigm. They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the
[3:36:59.500 --> 3:37:07.100]  trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome and so even though
[3:37:07.100 --> 3:37:12.860]  it seems like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack
[3:37:12.860 --> 3:37:19.420]  human freedom because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open so as bad
[3:37:19.420 --> 3:37:24.700]  as these times are and a lot of negative things are about to happen. Realize humanity is winning.
[3:37:24.700 --> 3:37:31.180]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible.
[3:37:31.180 --> 3:37:37.660]  That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable. So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and
[3:37:37.660 --> 3:37:42.140]  direct your soul and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment
[3:37:42.140 --> 3:37:47.740]  from Alex Jones and my crew to you. We will never back down from the globalists and we will never
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:55.020]  surrender. I am a very humble person but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with
[3:37:55.020 --> 3:37:59.020]  the globalist attacking humanity with all the terrible things that are unfolding I want you to
[3:37:59.020 --> 3:38:05.500]  know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure so I get to see things
[3:38:05.500 --> 3:38:10.620]  zero public doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress
[3:38:10.620 --> 3:38:17.580]  or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry people are really really away from the
[3:38:17.580 --> 3:38:22.460]  establishment. They don't want to go along with the globalists but they're scared, they're looking
[3:38:22.460 --> 3:38:28.380]  for leadership. Well that's where M4 comes in. You fund us, you support m4sore.com, you get
[3:38:28.380 --> 3:38:33.820]  rape policy at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular
[3:38:33.820 --> 3:38:38.700]  but the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to
[3:38:38.700 --> 3:38:45.420]  take the heat. That's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the
[3:38:45.420 --> 3:38:53.260]  shock groups in the information war. Fund us at m4sore.com. The globalists are having their
[3:38:53.260 --> 3:38:59.180]  revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution. We have to first recognize this
[3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:08.220]  anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into
[3:39:08.220 --> 3:39:17.660]  these artificial corporate controlled slaves, worsted slaves, just just property from cradle
[3:39:17.660 --> 3:39:24.540]  to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of
[3:39:25.180 --> 3:39:30.300]  dominance and satanic control. We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world
[3:39:30.940 --> 3:39:33.900]  which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[3:39:33.900 --> 3:39:39.580]  that is the opposite of their dystopia. It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to
[3:39:39.580 --> 3:39:44.940]  change the world and it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[3:39:45.740 --> 3:39:48.940]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[3:39:48.940 --> 3:40:18.780]  All right, as we finish up here with the Carol Quigley classic book,
[3:40:19.020 --> 3:40:24.300]  Angle American Establishment. Quigley moves on to talk about the function of the state and the
[3:40:24.300 --> 3:40:30.300]  liberal imperium was to basically become a kind of quasi-religion. It would be a religious level
[3:40:30.300 --> 3:40:37.100]  status by which people would accept the imperial philosophy that would supplant belief and trust
[3:40:37.100 --> 3:40:44.060]  in their own nation-states. Literally they propagandized this into the mass mind by
[3:40:44.060 --> 3:40:49.020]  using all of the outlets that they had bought. In fact, they had bought most of the media outlets
[3:40:49.020 --> 3:40:55.020]  in the UK by the 30s and 40s including the Times, the Independent, all of those the economists were
[3:40:55.020 --> 3:41:00.860]  owned by the Rothschild Rhodes-Millner network. By these media outlets they were beginning to
[3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:08.380]  inculcate the idea that the Atlanticist goals would be disseminated through every outlet,
[3:41:08.380 --> 3:41:14.620]  educational media, and it would include the idea of removing the belief in individual sovereignty,
[3:41:14.620 --> 3:41:20.300]  getting rid of the idea of the nation-state, getting rid of the idea of family and loyalty to
[3:41:20.300 --> 3:41:27.660]  family and God and supplanting that with loyalty to international ideals through the promotion of
[3:41:27.660 --> 3:41:36.540]  generic ideas like freedom. Just freedom, man. There's an amazing section where I think Quigley
[3:41:36.540 --> 3:41:45.580]  wrote this back in the 80s, 81. I don't know if he wrote that, but my copy came out in 8081.
[3:41:46.140 --> 3:41:52.700]  But what's amazing is that there's a section where they even talk about this like it is the
[3:41:53.420 --> 3:42:01.580]  logical outgrowing of a series of revolutions. Now, we know that Alta-Stoxy called this the
[3:42:01.580 --> 3:42:08.060]  final revolution, right? And so there's a section where they even talk about the logical process,
[3:42:08.060 --> 3:42:13.420]  so-called of evolutionary thought and evolution as a kind of mystical religion.
[3:42:14.860 --> 3:42:19.740]  And Quigley says, yes, that is the attitude of the British Empire, that they thought it was a
[3:42:19.740 --> 3:42:25.820]  logical process of a kind of Luciferian evolution. Now, he doesn't use the word Luciferian, I do.
[3:42:25.820 --> 3:42:31.820]  But he does talk about on page 186 the fact that this secret society had by
[3:42:33.500 --> 3:42:39.740]  the middle of the century basically set up 2,500 royal and super-international affairs
[3:42:39.740 --> 3:42:46.060]  members. There were 100 people in the Milner group and then the Society of Elect being 12 people
[3:42:46.060 --> 3:42:50.780]  and then the Society of Elect being run by the top three. So again, you've got the Lord
[3:42:50.780 --> 3:42:56.780]  Rothschild, Rhodes and Milner, the top three, under them the Society of Elect, 12 people,
[3:42:56.780 --> 3:43:01.740]  which is almost kind of a weird version of the apostles, right? Under them the Milner group,
[3:43:01.740 --> 3:43:06.460]  which has 100 people and they're over the 2,500 members of the Royal Institute for International
[3:43:06.460 --> 3:43:15.900]  Affairs and that's who sets up the American branches of CFR, et cetera. So this is a real
[3:43:15.900 --> 3:43:21.820]  historical entity with an actual structure like a pyramid, right? I even drew a little
[3:43:21.820 --> 3:43:28.620]  helpful pyramid there to let you know what this is talking about. And we even know who's behind
[3:43:28.620 --> 3:43:35.900]  this and we know that they carved up the globe in the 20th century. They're the people who set up
[3:43:36.700 --> 3:43:43.980]  nations like Iraq, right? They're the one, this is the the entity that sent T. E. Lawrence in to
[3:43:43.980 --> 3:43:53.580]  divide up Saudi Arabia, right? The great British spy T. E. Lawrence. So if you've never seen Lawrence
[3:43:53.580 --> 3:43:58.540]  of Arabia, by the way, go watch the Peter O'Toole movie. It's making this same point, right? So you
[3:43:58.540 --> 3:44:02.860]  get an insight into the way the British Empire function. Now, I mentioned that they were able
[3:44:02.860 --> 3:44:07.820]  to co-opt the U.S. into coming back under this superstructure particularly at the time of World
[3:44:07.820 --> 3:44:13.660]  War II. And how did this come about? Well, there was a couple spies, actually a handful of them,
[3:44:13.660 --> 3:44:19.580]  who were very crucial to doing this. And amazingly, they weren't just unknown spies. They were actually
[3:44:19.580 --> 3:44:25.660]  people involved in Hollywood. They're called the Irregulars, right? So here we have the Irregulars,
[3:44:25.660 --> 3:44:31.580]  that is people like Roald Dahl, people like Ian Fleming. Yes, Ian Fleming helped Bill Donovan
[3:44:31.580 --> 3:44:37.500]  set up the OSS. And another important figure from Canada, Canadian intelligence named William
[3:44:37.500 --> 3:44:43.980]  Stevenson, codenamed Intrepid. So together, this coterie of British intelligence assets working
[3:44:43.980 --> 3:44:52.220]  for this group that Quigley's talking about, were able to convince our president at the time of his
[3:44:52.220 --> 3:45:01.740]  FDR, right, to help set up this secret inner core of spies in the intelligence security state,
[3:45:01.740 --> 3:45:08.620]  right, the National Security Act in 1942. And all we got to do this to protect America against all
[3:45:08.620 --> 3:45:14.460]  the, you know, the threats to our freedom. And the earlier, right, we had already had a co-opting
[3:45:14.460 --> 3:45:21.180]  of the banking through Colonel Edwin Mandelhouse under Woodrow Wilson, right, and the 14 points.
[3:45:21.180 --> 3:45:26.700]  Well, under FDR, it's the four freedoms, right? So it's the same group that had taken over the
[3:45:26.700 --> 3:45:33.740]  Federal Reserve Bank of the country back in 1913 through Colonel House as their agent.
[3:45:34.540 --> 3:45:41.740]  They make another huge move, right, under FDR, they're setting up the secret deep state
[3:45:41.740 --> 3:45:49.420]  national security state, which is again an agent of this entity, okay, Quigley even goes into the
[3:45:49.420 --> 3:45:54.460]  inquiry, right, the inquiry inquiry was already there. It was already present. That was the post
[3:45:54.460 --> 3:46:02.060]  World War I sort of nascent intelligence agency that was forming. But it's these same people,
[3:46:02.060 --> 3:46:07.660]  right, part of the inquiry together with these irregulars, these British spies who set up our
[3:46:07.660 --> 3:46:13.660]  national security state, which from that point on is the real controlling power of the country.
[3:46:13.660 --> 3:46:19.500]  It's that simple. It's not draconians. It's not we have to sit around and speculate about aliens.
[3:46:19.500 --> 3:46:23.820]  We don't have to wonder. I mean, there's a demonic element to it. Yeah. But we don't have
[3:46:23.820 --> 3:46:31.420]  to wonder who was behind all this. Who transitioned the country from a non-interventionist into a
[3:46:31.420 --> 3:46:37.980]  totally globalist, right, role-player Pax Americana. These people, we know it. It's in the books.
[3:46:38.860 --> 3:46:42.700]  There's no mystery here, right? Well, I don't know. Maybe there's a conspiracy. Maybe something's
[3:46:42.700 --> 3:46:48.620]  going on. Who knows? Is it this group? Is it that group? They're all part of the same group,
[3:46:48.620 --> 3:46:52.380]  right? The same people that go to CFR, go to the Tri-Lateral Commission and they go to
[3:46:52.380 --> 3:46:57.420]  Bilderberg. It's just revolving doors. In fact, Quigley even has a discussion of revolving door
[3:46:57.420 --> 3:47:04.460]  stuff in here. So this is where we get after World War II and into the Cold War, right?
[3:47:04.460 --> 3:47:11.980]  The purpose of the Cold War is to get the whole world involved now in a new conflict that allows
[3:47:11.980 --> 3:47:18.380]  for the erecting of the technocratic infrastructure. Yes, that's the purpose of the Cold War in the
[3:47:18.380 --> 3:47:24.860]  long term, right? We wouldn't be where we are now with computers everywhere without the Cold War.
[3:47:25.580 --> 3:47:29.260]  And as I always point out, in the middle of Tragedy and Hope, there's that important chapter
[3:47:29.260 --> 3:47:34.700]  about the managerial society. The managerial society, as Quigley said back in the 60s,
[3:47:34.700 --> 3:47:40.860]  is the technocratic society. Quigley said computers, AI, they will run the world. They will run your
[3:47:40.860 --> 3:47:46.620]  cities. They'll run your houses. They'll run your life. So he knew and they have had this planned
[3:47:46.620 --> 3:47:52.060]  way back then because Quigley is an agent of these people. He's an apologist for these people.
[3:47:52.700 --> 3:47:57.180]  And he, oh, it's going to be great, right? It's going to fix all the problems.
[3:47:57.180 --> 3:48:00.700]  We're going to have to just kill everybody. He's another, he's a big depopulation advocate,
[3:48:00.700 --> 3:48:05.580]  just like all these people, because they adopted the Darwinian, Malthusian worldview.
[3:48:07.100 --> 3:48:12.860]  That is the operating system of this worldview. And it's directly connected to transhumanism.
[3:48:12.860 --> 3:48:17.820]  Again, Lord Birkenhead was talking about transhumanism before Aldous Uxley was,
[3:48:17.820 --> 3:48:23.500]  in the teens, in the 20s. The British Imperial Royal Society structure had already drawn up these
[3:48:23.500 --> 3:48:35.980]  plans. And so what we see playing out is not run by all the same British elites, right? It's the
[3:48:35.980 --> 3:48:41.020]  same power structure. There are some of the same families involved in this, but now it is passed
[3:48:41.020 --> 3:48:48.700]  on to the technocratic elite. There's still, yes, powerful Rockefellers. There's still powerful
[3:48:48.700 --> 3:48:55.340]  Rothschilds. There's still powerful families who engaged in this conspiracy 100 years ago,
[3:48:56.540 --> 3:49:05.420]  whose same power structure, the inquiry, the OSS, the CIA, those are adjuncts and busy bodies for
[3:49:05.420 --> 3:49:12.140]  the banking elite. And that's who runs things now. That's who set up Silicon Valley. That's who runs
[3:49:12.140 --> 3:49:17.180]  the world almost. And that's who we're fighting. So meanwhile, everybody's distracted by a bunch
[3:49:17.180 --> 3:49:21.740]  of politics. And I'm not saying everybody involved in local politics is bad or anything like that.
[3:49:21.740 --> 3:49:27.740]  But quickly said 100 years ago, the politicians are kind of a punch in duty show or what,
[3:49:27.740 --> 3:49:31.580]  or like a puppet show or something like that. Because these are the real people that nobody
[3:49:31.580 --> 3:49:35.580]  actually can ever figure out. Even though it's publicly in the books, the people can't figure
[3:49:35.580 --> 3:49:40.460]  out who runs this stuff. And it's the same people like Klaus Schwab. They represent this people,
[3:49:40.460 --> 3:49:47.100]  right? Prince Charles was just on Klaus Schwab's podcast or whatever a few months ago, right?
[3:49:47.100 --> 3:49:54.060]  Talking about how we've got to have this nasty population. This is the crew. This is the group.
[3:49:54.060 --> 3:50:00.220]  It's the same, at least, structure of an inner party that Orwell talked about, right? And remember,
[3:50:00.220 --> 3:50:04.860]  Orwell was talking about English socialism. But the people who ran this system said,
[3:50:04.860 --> 3:50:09.740]  we're just going to combine the best, well, actually the worst elements, right? They would
[3:50:09.740 --> 3:50:14.300]  say the best, but the worst elements of capitalism and socialism into a third way,
[3:50:14.300 --> 3:50:19.980]  which will be the global technocratic government. And that's why the Cold War was necessary to set
[3:50:19.980 --> 3:50:26.060]  up the tech infrastructure across the globe, right? The spy satellites, which will become this
[3:50:26.060 --> 3:50:31.180]  network of interlinked Internet of Things, right? This all comes out of the Cold War.
[3:50:31.180 --> 3:50:59.260]  And that's what they had planned the whole time. So you don't know this is a key book.
