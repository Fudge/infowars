[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:27.400]  welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Monday September 2nd Labor Day and this
[00:27.400 --> 00:31.760]  has been an amazing weekend we have some amazing news and I'm sure you've heard
[00:31.760 --> 00:37.400]  it by now but we still keep looking at this what Obama said on Saturday
[00:37.400 --> 00:41.920]  basically that he was actually going to follow the Constitution but wait he
[00:41.920 --> 00:46.080]  didn't really say that it was a bit confusing when you saw the announcement
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.400]  and he said at first that he had the right to strike anytime he wanted to and
[00:50.400 --> 00:54.600]  then he said might happen tomorrow might happen in a couple of days it might
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.160]  happen the next week but he said he had the authority to do it and then he
[00:57.160 --> 01:02.200]  started saying he was going to go to Congress so basically he's kind of you
[01:02.200 --> 01:07.800]  know making the the case that he can do it at any time he wants he still has the
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.800]  authority to do this but he's going to actually follow the Constitution but now
[01:12.800 --> 01:17.080]  we hear from Fox News they've been told what from the State Department that he's
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.320]  gonna he plans on doing this anyway whether he gets congressional approval
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.440]  or not so we'll have to wait and see but either way this is a huge huge sea
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.840]  change it was a big deal when the British Parliament the end of the week
[01:30.840 --> 01:36.520]  voted down the Prime Minister as the first time since 1782 that they voted
[01:36.520 --> 01:40.800]  down a Prime Minister's recommendation for war at that time they were
[01:40.800 --> 01:46.200]  recommending to go to war against continue the war against America and they
[01:46.200 --> 01:50.600]  voted that down but since then they have not gone against a Prime Minister's
[01:50.600 --> 01:55.880]  recommendation and they did and then on Friday night I was eating in a restaurant
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.080]  I was looking at CNN on television and I was just the sound was down so I was
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.560]  just looking at the subtitles and the lower thirds and they kept putting up
[02:05.560 --> 02:11.480]  there on the lower thirds that Obama was war weary well you know he's not war
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.720]  weary it's the American people that are tired we're tired of war and more
[02:16.720 --> 02:21.720]  importantly we're tired of being lied to and this is a revolution that's being
[02:21.720 --> 02:27.240]  led by info wars and alternative media people are waking up only a 9% approval
[02:27.240 --> 02:30.520]  rating he could see where this was heading he could see that they had
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.360]  blinked in the UK he could see that people were very mad even in France
[02:35.360 --> 02:39.720]  because both France and the UK they had about 70% of the people who opposed the
[02:39.720 --> 02:43.560]  war the French went ahead and approved it but now that looks like even that's
[02:43.560 --> 02:49.480]  going to be questioned it was thrown out in England but instead of 70% of the
[02:49.480 --> 02:55.480]  people opposing it here in America it was 90% opposing it so that's why they
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.120]  pulled back it isn't that he wants to go to Congress he doesn't want to go to
[02:59.120 --> 03:03.160]  Congress he doesn't even want to go to the UN he wants to do whatever he wishes
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.880]  to do but he's doing it and we've got major figures like Ron Paul Pat Buchanan
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.280]  saying for the first time this is a false flag you know that's not the kind of
[03:13.280 --> 03:18.920]  terminology you heard anywhere except info wars until the Boston bombing then
[03:18.920 --> 03:22.800]  that term got discussed quite a bit we made a very good case that it was a
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.600]  false flag attack there now everybody is aware of the technique of a false flag
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.360]  and you see people not afraid to come out and say that this is exactly what's
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.080]  going on now Vladimir Putin didn't say that but he actually defined what a
[03:37.080 --> 03:40.520]  false flag was he said this is utter nonsense and then he talked about how
[03:40.520 --> 03:43.880]  they're using this narrative to do what they want to do this this false
[03:43.880 --> 03:48.560]  constructed narrative but this is really really blowing up in their face even
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.680]  after he said that he was going to go to Congress now we've got this this thing
[03:53.680 --> 03:58.760]  that's going viral first we had one naval officer who held up a sign that
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.280]  said he wasn't going to go fight an Assyrian civil war on the side of Al Qaeda
[04:03.280 --> 04:09.080]  and it is exploding all over the social media you've got all kinds of soldiers
[04:09.080 --> 04:15.640]  and sailors holding up signs essentially saying the same thing that brings up a
[04:15.640 --> 04:21.640]  danger that they may actually do a false flag that's even bigger here even
[04:21.640 --> 04:25.080]  they might do something because people are not seeing that this is something
[04:25.080 --> 04:28.360]  that we need to be involved in we don't have a dog in this fight so they may
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.880]  try to do something here we're going to have a special report coming up from
[04:32.880 --> 04:36.080]  Alex Jones he's going to be joining us in the studio at the midpoint of the

[04:40.000 --> 04:45.640]  where we are the sea change and the danger that comes up of a new false flag

[07:59.120 --> 08:19.720]  today welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for
[08:19.720 --> 08:32.520]  Alex Jones that's right we're right here from Austin and I'm filling in for
[08:32.520 --> 08:37.200]  Alex Jones my name is David Knight this is Monday September the 2nd Labor Day
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.360]  and we were talking just before the break about what an amazing revelation
[08:42.360 --> 08:48.240]  we've had this week of the Obama regime backing down I use the term regime you
[08:48.240 --> 08:53.040]  know they they love to say that it's the Obama administration and it's the
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.560]  Syrian regime or it's the Iranian regime or it's whoever they're trying to demonize
[08:57.560 --> 09:02.040]  at the moment they have a regime but we have an administration well we have an
[09:02.040 --> 09:05.680]  administration when they start following the Constitution and they haven't been
[09:05.680 --> 09:10.360]  doing that but it looks like maybe they will except that we then learn from Fox
[09:10.360 --> 09:15.760]  News that the State Department has said no regardless of what Congress says he's
[09:15.760 --> 09:20.040]  going to attack so we'll see what happens we've got about a week before
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.760]  Congress comes back and the UN inspectors have left Syria and they're
[09:24.760 --> 09:28.120]  saying it's going to take them about a week to analyze the data now the last
[09:28.120 --> 09:34.560]  time the UN inspectors went and it went into Syria and looked at the as a
[09:34.560 --> 09:40.440]  supposed gas attack they ruled that it indeed was sharing gas and they ruled
[09:40.440 --> 09:44.720]  that it was the rebels and one of the reasons they did was because both the
[09:44.720 --> 09:49.640]  way that it was delivered they were homemade rockets and the sarin gas
[09:49.640 --> 09:55.800]  itself was homemade you know it doesn't take a military industrial complex to
[09:55.800 --> 10:02.000]  make sarin gas the most famous sarin gas attacks outside of what Saddam Hussein
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.840]  did the most famous ones were the ones that happened in Japan and those were
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.920]  done by a small cult so it doesn't take a military industrial complex to do a
[10:10.920 --> 10:15.520]  sarin gas attack and what they found in May that was just a couple of months ago
[10:15.520 --> 10:21.360]  they found that it was a rebel attack that it was a false flag attack they
[10:21.360 --> 10:26.000]  were trying to blame it on Syria to try to draw in or to give an excuse for the
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.360]  US which is actually not reluctantly drawn in we're not we don't have a
[10:30.360 --> 10:34.600]  government that as CNN likes to characterize it is war weary
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.640]  Obama is not weary of war at all as a matter of fact over the weekend he was
[10:39.640 --> 10:43.960]  still doing drone strikes he had six people killed in Yemen he had another
[10:43.960 --> 10:50.760]  three that he killed in Pakistan what we have here is a president who is
[10:50.760 --> 10:55.480]  killing people all the time with drone strikes what it looks like is really
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.680]  just a couple of thugs going at it like the Bloods and the Crips you know they
[11:00.680 --> 11:04.560]  have their drive-by shootings in the neighborhood where they try to set up
[11:04.560 --> 11:09.600]  their turf wars well Obama's got fly-by shootings you know he comes in and
[11:09.600 --> 11:13.120]  basically goes against this other gang the only place where this analogy breaks
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.840]  down is the fact that he actually creates and controls that other gang you
[11:17.840 --> 11:24.000]  know the Al Qaeda was created by Zbigniew Brzezinski during the Carter
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.440]  administration which eventually became Al Qaeda it was the Mujahideen is what
[11:28.440 --> 11:32.640]  they call themselves at the time and they were Reagan's freedom fighters and
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.720]  they're still allied with us in many areas especially in Syria as Kosenich
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.440]  said we would be going in on the side of Al Qaeda we would be their air force
[11:42.440 --> 11:48.640]  and he and Ron Paul and many people are asking why we would do this well why
[11:48.640 --> 11:51.280]  have we had the kind of foreign policy that we've had since World War two why
[11:51.280 --> 11:56.280]  do we get involved in every civil war every struggle everywhere usually we
[11:56.280 --> 12:02.560]  wind up arming both sides making enemies of both sides and then selling even more
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.920]  weapons when we go in and take out both sides and it looks like that's what
[12:06.920 --> 12:10.840]  they're trying to do again now this has been a this is a huge sea change and
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.280]  Alex Jones is going to be here at the midpoint of the show and he's going to
[12:15.280 --> 12:19.600]  be talking about the implications of this this has been so big there's been a
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.360]  moving revolt on social media we've got people holding up signs who are sailors
[12:24.360 --> 12:28.320]  and soldiers saying they're not going to go fight in a civil war on the side of
[12:28.320 --> 12:33.640]  Al Qaeda this is really huge only 9% of the people support this remember during
[12:33.640 --> 12:40.360]  the Iraq war Bush had about 72% approval rating but that was BS that was
[12:40.360 --> 12:44.800]  before Snowden that was before the alternative media info wars were
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.080]  vindicated and verified about what we've been telling the public about
[12:49.080 --> 12:52.560]  government spying for quite some time let's look at some of the news is
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.720]  breaking today we've got from the New York Times drug agents use vast phone
[12:57.720 --> 13:03.720]  trove eclipsing the NSA yeah it turns out that the DEA and the war on drugs
[13:03.720 --> 13:10.040]  the I would say the war of drugs has been attacking the American people and
[13:10.040 --> 13:15.840]  the Bill of Rights up until the point we had the war of terrorism and it's now
[13:15.840 --> 13:20.720]  the DEA they're finding out was doing far more spying on America than even the
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.200]  NSA so this is revelation that's coming out and this is something of course that
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.320]  Obama doesn't want us thinking about he also doesn't want us thinking about the
[13:29.320 --> 13:34.920]  fact that the IRS is continuing to hound Tea Party Patriots this is something
[13:34.920 --> 13:40.120]  that was reported by the Washington Times IRS continues to hound Tea Party
[13:40.120 --> 13:45.000]  Patriots demands even more data for tax exempt status so they've got their
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.080]  enemies list just like Richard Nixon did they're breaking the law they're
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.600]  violating the Constitution they're not just he's dropping or breaking in on a
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.520]  few on the Democratic headquarters they're eavesdropping and breaking in on
[13:56.520 --> 14:01.320]  people all over the United States on everybody in the United States people
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.320]  are upset about this foreign governments are upset about this all of this all of
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.400]  this is tied together the lack of support the fact that we can't get Britain
[14:12.400 --> 14:17.440]  who's historically always been our ally we can't get them to sign on to this
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.480]  because they distrust us even more revelations today about Brazil and Mexico
[14:21.480 --> 14:26.640]  being spied on by the NSA we are spying on everyone and now we see that you know
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.840]  Facebook one of the one of the organizations Facebook and Google are
[14:30.840 --> 14:36.400]  part of the control grid Facebook is now going to add your profile your photo
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.200]  profile to facial recognition databases now they've been tagging people all along
[14:41.200 --> 14:46.640]  they're going to take this to a new height so this is this is also something
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.040]  people Facebook is really kind of like a training wheels for people gets you used
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.520]  to the fact that you're going to be watched everything that you do is going
[14:54.520 --> 15:01.680]  to be followed Facebook is a wonderful tool for the system to get the especially
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.120]  the younger generation to not really understand the importance of privacy and
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.680]  we've seen over and over again how people are burned by things they put on
[15:09.680 --> 15:13.320]  Facebook but people continue to put that out there but we're going to be taking
[15:13.320 --> 15:16.600]  your calls today because we're going to have in the next segment we're going to
[15:16.600 --> 15:21.560]  start to talk about a multiple-choice quiz we're going to talk about what
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.240]  really happened in Syria you know there's been so many explanations put out
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.640]  there for what happened we really want to know you know what you think this is
[15:31.640 --> 15:34.560]  a debate that we're going to have as a nation this is something we need to keep
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.440]  on our elected representatives we need to really put pressure on them and so
[15:39.440 --> 15:42.560]  it's important that we have this discussion so we're going to put out
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.880]  there's a lot of explanations that have been offered on either side and a lot of
[15:47.880 --> 15:52.560]  contradicting explanations put out by the State Department and by the American
[15:52.560 --> 15:57.040]  regime so we want to see what you think about that we've got some reactions in
[15:57.040 --> 16:02.640]  Congress of course Peter King former homely and security chairman is
[16:02.640 --> 16:07.760]  absolutely horrified horrified that Obama would not go to war that he would
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.960]  actually even consult with Congress he said President Obama is abdicating his
[16:12.960 --> 16:17.160]  responsibility as commander-in-chief and he is undermining the authority of
[16:17.160 --> 16:22.520]  future presidents he said the president doesn't need 535 members of Congress to
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.800]  enforce his own red line well Peter King have you even read the Constitution
[16:28.800 --> 16:32.400]  that you swore to or is it like those bills that you sign all the time that
[16:32.400 --> 16:37.440]  you don't ever read I mean this is just amazing we need to get rid of Peter King
[16:37.440 --> 16:41.400]  in New York we need to get rid of Lindsay Graham in South Carolina and he's got
[16:41.400 --> 16:45.240]  some competition coming up in South Carolina I just hope it's not so many
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.480]  people running against him that they delude each other and and and get him
[16:49.480 --> 16:53.160]  reelected now we've also got Mike Rogers chairman of the House Intelligence
[16:53.160 --> 16:59.040]  Committee and he's the fellow who pushes for CISPA all the time and he says this
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.640]  is really about the credibility of the United States of America standing up for
[17:03.640 --> 17:07.720]  anti-proliferation and the use of chemical and biological weapons it's that
[17:07.720 --> 17:12.520]  serious you see it's about our credibility we drew a line in the sand
[17:12.520 --> 17:17.280]  and we have to stand by that line you know it's kind of like the bully you
[17:17.280 --> 17:20.520]  know when the bully draw draws a line in the sand and you cross that line he's
[17:20.520 --> 17:24.480]  got to do something about it and that's really the overarching justification
[17:24.480 --> 17:29.360]  that John Kerry and Obama and Mike Rogers and Peter King and do you notice
[17:29.360 --> 17:34.160]  how it's always the people who are always against due process who are always
[17:34.160 --> 17:38.160]  for the police and surveillance state the Peter Kings the Mike Rogers the
[17:38.160 --> 17:44.440]  Lindsey Graham's and the John McCain's they're always always for war as well
[17:44.440 --> 17:49.320]  right it's war and the police state it's always the same people on the wrong
[17:49.320 --> 17:53.680]  side of all these vital issues but we do have some people on the other side
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.200]  Justin Mosh said it's unfortunate that it's gotten to the point where I have to
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.040]  thank the president for following the Constitution and the law and then he goes
[18:02.040 --> 18:08.200]  on to say President Obama hasn't come close to justifying war in Syria I look
[18:08.200 --> 18:11.640]  forward to this debate the president must comply with a vote of Congress that
[18:11.640 --> 18:16.880]  is not optional well good for Justin O Mosh he's a of course a congressman from
[18:16.880 --> 18:23.040]  Michigan and then Rand Paul had a great statement yesterday on meet the press he
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.680]  said how can you ask a man to be the first one to die for a mistake and of
[18:28.680 --> 18:34.520]  course that's a paraphrase from John Kerry John Kerry had said famously at the
[18:34.520 --> 18:38.840]  end of the Vietnam War he said how do you ask a man to be the last one to die
[18:38.840 --> 18:44.080]  for a mistake and he's now on the side of asking someone to be the first one to
[18:44.080 --> 18:49.560]  die for a mistake now we have to have that clip ready for of Rand Paul yeah
[18:49.560 --> 18:53.520]  let's take a look at what Rand Paul said that's not getting as much coverage about
[18:53.520 --> 18:57.080]  this whole thing about the red line go ahead and play that so it seems to be
[18:57.080 --> 18:59.640]  senator that what the president is saying in this
[18:59.640 --> 19:03.960]  a drafted resolution that he'd like Congress to authorize that the United
[19:03.960 --> 19:08.480]  States must draw a line at the use of chemical weapons any weapons of mass
[19:08.480 --> 19:14.200]  destruction in war that you simply cannot allow it and that if we strike Assad
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.840]  and he uses them again I heard Secretary Kerry say that the United States might
[19:18.840 --> 19:22.920]  strike Assad again if he uses the weapons why not draw that line in the
[19:22.920 --> 19:28.560]  sand as the president wants you to and say we can't allow WMD to be used I
[19:28.560 --> 19:33.120]  think the line in the sand should be that America gets involved when American
[19:33.120 --> 19:37.320]  interests are threatened I don't see American interest involved on either side
[19:37.320 --> 19:41.880]  of this Syrian war I see Assad who has protected Christians for a number of
[19:41.880 --> 19:46.200]  decades and then I see the Islamic repels on the other side who have been
[19:46.200 --> 19:49.480]  attacking Christians I see all right that's good we're coming up to break
[19:49.480 --> 19:54.960]  that's really important it's like don't draw a line in a stupid place and then
[19:54.960 --> 19:58.120]  back yourself into a corner where you've got to go to war and you've got to kill
[19:58.120 --> 20:01.360]  people we're gonna be right back and we're gonna take your calls those

[24:13.040 --> 24:16.480]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex but
[24:16.480 --> 24:19.360]  Alex is going to be joining us at the midpoint of the show he's going to be
[24:19.360 --> 24:23.200]  joining us at about 12 30 central time and he's going to be talking about the
[24:23.200 --> 24:27.760]  major sea change that we've seen happen in just the last week you know people
[24:27.760 --> 24:31.920]  are not just talking about false flags we've got Ron Paul we got Buchanan
[24:31.920 --> 24:35.960]  Pat Buchanan people talking about false flags everyone is aware of this
[24:35.960 --> 24:41.640]  after the Boston bombing we've also got a public that is rejecting the war
[24:41.640 --> 24:47.640]  narrative 90% of the public is rejecting that you know when Bush put out his
[24:47.640 --> 24:54.880]  narrative he had 70% in favor now there's 90% opposed a huge huge change and
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.320]  that's because of info wars and the alternative media that that's happening
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.200]  we've got soldiers and sellers everywhere holding up signs saying they're
[25:02.200 --> 25:07.160]  not going to go fight and die in a Syrian civil war on the side of al-Qaeda and
[25:07.160 --> 25:11.440]  that's exactly what's happening they know exactly what's happening but we
[25:11.440 --> 25:16.200]  still have an administration that says that they have drawn this red line they
[25:16.200 --> 25:20.480]  are going to stand on this that our credibility is on the line it's not our
[25:20.480 --> 25:24.800]  credibility is the Obama regime's credibility it's not the American
[25:24.800 --> 25:28.640]  credibility in America and the Obama regime lost their credibility with
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.640]  everybody with the NSA leaks and with all the other lies that they told about
[25:33.640 --> 25:37.920]  the first or about the Iraq war that happened the second Iraq war the lying
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.840]  narrative about that and just before the break we had Rand Paul was on meet the
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.640]  press yesterday with David Gregory and you heard the questions that David
[25:47.640 --> 25:51.520]  Gregory just asked him basically David Gregory was essentially being a
[25:51.520 --> 25:56.040]  sycophant for the Obama administration towing this line that well we have to
[25:56.040 --> 25:59.920]  do something now because the red lines been drawn and saying what Peter King
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.480]  has said oh this this diminishes the presidency well let's hope so because the
[26:03.480 --> 26:09.120]  presidency has started acting like a dictatorship in in Libya as well as in
[26:09.120 --> 26:14.160]  Syria he's assuming that he can just go in and invade countries just like he goes
[26:14.160 --> 26:18.960]  and kills individuals in foreign countries with his drone strikes kills
[26:18.960 --> 26:24.000]  American citizens without due process with his drone strikes let's continue
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.280]  with this reply from Rand Paul because he really pushes back against this
[26:28.280 --> 26:33.280]  ridiculous idea that because Obama drew a red line now the credibility of the
[26:33.280 --> 26:38.880]  United States is at stake I think the line in the sand should be that America
[26:38.880 --> 26:42.760]  gets involved when American interests are threatened I don't see American
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.200]  interests involved on either side of this Syrian war I see Assad who has
[26:47.200 --> 26:51.520]  protected Christians for a number of decades and then I see the Islamic
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.760]  rebels on the other side who have been attacking Christians I see Al Qaeda on
[26:55.760 --> 27:00.240]  one side the side we would go in to support and I see it to be murky and I
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.680]  don't see a clear cut American interest I don't see either party that is
[27:04.680 --> 27:09.960]  victorious if either party is victorious being an American ally you are a
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.880]  United States senator that's good you may let's lay that right there excellent
[27:14.880 --> 27:19.560]  point you know you don't draw a red line in the sand and then say if you cross out
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.720]  we're gonna go to war for you now they're trying to make this a a humanitarian
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.080]  mission right they're always trying to say that we're going to rescue somebody
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.680]  how is launching cruise missiles into a country going to save it it's just gonna
[27:33.680 --> 27:36.920]  kill more people and the people understand that there's been a massive
[27:36.920 --> 27:42.400]  exodus of refugees out of Syria they know what's gonna happen when we saw
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.560]  this buildup on Friday night when it looked like Obama was going to announce
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.160]  on Saturday that he was going to launch the missiles and was going to launch
[27:50.160 --> 27:55.680]  the missiles because he was sending in a tremendous armada off the coast of
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.000]  Syria everything was prepared we had reports at the end of the week that
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.080]  bombers were on their way to the Middle East so it looked like they were going
[28:03.080 --> 28:09.360]  to launch an attack and CNN was part of that CNN was building that up CNN was
[28:09.360 --> 28:14.720]  running this narrative talking about how Obama was tired of war but he had to
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.960]  do this for humanitarian reasons then they started talking about how they were
[28:18.960 --> 28:24.240]  going to surgical strikes they started talking about how accurate the bombs were
[28:24.240 --> 28:29.280]  give me a break I mean look at the drone strikes that Obama is doing all the
[28:29.280 --> 28:33.880]  time are those surgical are those accurate yeah he killed some more people
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.560]  this weekend he killed six in Yemen I think that was on Friday then on Saturday
[28:38.560 --> 28:43.920]  he killed another four in Pakistan he says we don't know how many other people
[28:43.920 --> 28:47.520]  were killed how many other innocent bystanders were killed you know this
[28:47.520 --> 28:52.280]  has gone into the thousands Lindsey Graham was bragging about how it was over
[28:52.280 --> 28:56.880]  4,000 people that the United States had killed with drone strikes and of course
[28:56.880 --> 29:02.600]  there was the famous drone strike against an American who did not have due
[29:02.600 --> 29:06.320]  process and that's the problem just as who pointed out before in the last
[29:06.320 --> 29:10.440]  segment when you have people like Peter King people like Mike Rogers who are
[29:10.440 --> 29:13.360]  pushing for the police state pushing for the surveillance state and pushing for
[29:13.360 --> 29:17.880]  war do you think that they're going to be concerned when that same kind of
[29:17.880 --> 29:22.360]  activity comes back to America if they don't see these other people as human
[29:22.360 --> 29:25.600]  beings in other countries if they can kill them with impunity they think
[29:25.600 --> 29:29.040]  they're going to do that here as well it's the same people who have nothing
[29:29.040 --> 29:31.760]  but contempt for the Constitution the Bill of Rights who are the biggest
[29:31.760 --> 29:36.360]  warmongers and they are going to attack American citizens mark our word on this

[33:35.240 --> 33:41.160]  show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex Jones on this Labor Day 2013 and we
[33:41.160 --> 33:45.560]  had amazing news that we're talking about and that is Obama the Obama regime
[33:45.560 --> 33:48.920]  I'm not gonna call it administration if they if they call other governments
[33:48.920 --> 33:52.440]  regimes will call them a regime and we'll call them a regime until they start
[33:52.440 --> 33:56.280]  following the Constitution then there'll be an administration then there'll be
[33:56.280 --> 34:00.680]  somebody who is actually being a faithful steward as opposed to usurpers
[34:00.680 --> 34:04.120]  but until they do that we're gonna call them the regime the Obama regime
[34:04.120 --> 34:09.320]  blinked this weekend and said that they're going to try to get the Congress
[34:09.320 --> 34:16.040]  to approve striking Syria now they subsequently leaked that the State
[34:16.040 --> 34:21.000]  Department senior officials leaked to Fox News that they intend to strike anyway
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.840]  we'll see what happens about that but you know a lot of the people in the
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.280]  Republican Party I think they're they're counting on Warhawks and the
[34:29.280 --> 34:32.680]  Republican Party decide with them and I think they're gonna pull strings as far
[34:32.680 --> 34:39.200]  as party loyalty for the Democrats but you know there was resistance and both
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.840]  the Democrats and the Republicans to this they were demanding they were
[34:42.840 --> 34:47.440]  sending letters demanding that John Boehner call them back to session so
[34:47.440 --> 34:51.800]  they could have a vote they were sending letters to Obama you had Democrats who
[34:51.800 --> 34:55.800]  were coming out against the Democrat Party leadership you had Republicans who
[34:55.800 --> 34:59.280]  are coming out against the Republican Party leadership it's not the leadership
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.280]  in these two parties it's the congressmen and the senators who are lower down
[35:04.280 --> 35:08.040]  that are having a problem with this but of course they're gonna count try to
[35:08.040 --> 35:11.320]  count on party loyalty of the Democrats and they're gonna try to count on knee
[35:11.320 --> 35:15.120]  jerk militarism and war mongering that's evident in a lot of their Republican
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.960]  Party but for the Republicans let's talk about this let's talk about the cost
[35:18.960 --> 35:24.200]  as one person put on Facebook a one and a half million dollars per missile to
[35:24.200 --> 35:28.560]  shoot at Syria yet we don't have the money to open the White House tours or
[35:28.560 --> 35:34.360]  to serve our troops hot meals that's right according to roll call a cruise
[35:34.360 --> 35:39.120]  missile strike against Syria could cost the Pentagon not the Pentagon American
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.200]  taxpayers it could cost the American taxpayers hundreds of millions of
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.480]  dollars and weapons the first few weeks of the Libyan operation costs the
[35:47.480 --> 35:53.760]  United States about six hundred million dollars see that's the real cause of
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.120]  this war the real cause of this war is to make money for the military industrial
[35:58.120 --> 36:02.640]  complex and of course the bankers profit from this too they don't profit if
[36:02.640 --> 36:06.200]  the stock market doesn't go up or down but they always make money when it
[36:06.200 --> 36:09.920]  changes so if it goes down they make money if it goes up they make money
[36:09.920 --> 36:14.120]  especially if they're the ones who know that they're driving it up or know that
[36:14.120 --> 36:17.360]  they're going to drive it down that's what this is about this is about the
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.520]  military industrial complex this is about bankers who make their fortunes off of
[36:21.520 --> 36:25.760]  war that's why they were originally called war mongers you know mongers are
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.720]  people who sold things like a fish monger sold fish or flesh monger sold
[36:30.720 --> 36:36.520]  people he was a prostitute a war monger was somebody who sold war they don't just
[36:36.520 --> 36:42.160]  support action they're selling war it's a financial exchange here for their the
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.160]  real masters who are running this government the real corporates are
[36:45.160 --> 36:50.160]  running this government but I want to go to a clip right now from the plate on
[36:50.160 --> 36:56.000]  MSNBC over the weekend they had a panel and one person on the panel was not
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.400]  trying to justify war this was Hillary Mann Leverett of the American
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.640]  University and she's a former Bush administration person now working at the
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.800]  university and this is what she had to say it is strikingly similar to the
[37:11.800 --> 37:15.040]  lead up to the warning rock I was in the Bush administration in the Bush White
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.040]  House dealing also with congressional Democrats and with people members of the
[37:19.040 --> 37:24.720]  media within New York Times with the NBC the herd mentality that took over to buy
[37:24.720 --> 37:28.960]  into the Bush administration's narrative that Saddam Hussein had to have
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.720]  chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction he was determined to use them
[37:32.720 --> 37:37.920]  against us with something unquestioned I remember going with a key member of the
[37:37.920 --> 37:41.880]  Bush National Security team to see President Clinton and he putting his arm
[37:41.880 --> 37:45.720]  around her telling her not only was the Intel right but she was doing the right
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.160]  thing morally it was not only a mistake it was based on manufactured evidence
[37:51.160 --> 37:56.280]  here nobody is asking this basic question except for our friends in Moscow
[37:56.280 --> 38:01.520]  what if Assad didn't order this what if this wasn't a Syrian troop chemical
[38:01.520 --> 38:06.040]  attack what if this was perpetrated by al-Qaeda affiliated oppositionists the
[38:06.040 --> 38:10.120]  consequences here for going into Syria are even more great than Iraq because if
[38:10.120 --> 38:15.080]  we go into Syria and we degrade and we weaken Assad to the extent the Jabhat al-Nusra
[38:15.080 --> 38:18.880]  and the other al-Qaeda affiliated oppositionists get away with mass chemical
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.480]  warfare if that's what happened and we think they're gonna stop there that's
[38:23.480 --> 38:27.960]  the definition of insanity when you know that's because I let's leave it right
[38:27.960 --> 38:33.080]  there she knows her stuff she went on to say because this is one of the scenarios
[38:33.080 --> 38:37.880]  that the government that the White House has put out talking about how they
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.280]  had intercepted battle plans over the phone and she pushed back against that
[38:42.280 --> 38:45.440]  in that interview you really need to see that entire interview it's too long
[38:45.440 --> 38:49.800]  for us to play here but she said the Syrian government doesn't do its battle
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.640]  plans over the phone this is just ridiculous and everybody knows that
[38:55.640 --> 38:59.960]  the narrative that the White House is putting out is that is ridiculous if you
[38:59.960 --> 39:09.320]  go to the White House website they have a file there it's it's called the
[39:09.320 --> 39:12.840]  government assessment of the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons on
[39:12.840 --> 39:18.140]  August 21st 2013 we've got a shot of it right up there on the screen if you're
[39:18.140 --> 39:24.360]  watching and in this they basically make their case and I want to go through and
[39:24.360 --> 39:29.200]  look at some of the arguments some of the absurd arguments that that our regime
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.200]  is making in terms of trying to get us involved in the Syrian civil war on the
[39:33.200 --> 39:37.880]  side of al-Qaeda the first thing that they say in there is that we have
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.680]  identified 100 videos that were attributed to the attack many of which
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.080]  show large number of bodies exhibiting physical science consistent with but not
[39:46.080 --> 39:50.960]  unique to nerve agent exposure they go on to say we assess that the Syrian
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.600]  opposition does not have the capability to fabricate all these videos so there
[39:55.600 --> 40:01.600]  you go it's the YouTube argument that you know we've seen all these videos so
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.200]  you know we've seen people who appear to be dying who appear to be suffering we
[40:06.200 --> 40:09.760]  don't know what it's from there's some people have even questioned whether or
[40:09.760 --> 40:14.560]  not that is real or whether or not that is staged and yet because we see people
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.440]  dying and there's a lot of evidence that people did actually die but we don't
[40:18.440 --> 40:22.400]  know what from we don't know who did it but that's a reason for us to get
[40:22.400 --> 40:27.040]  involved and as Kerry later said it doesn't matter who did it we need to get
[40:27.040 --> 40:29.600]  involved because they're saring gas there and we'll talk a little bit about
[40:29.600 --> 40:36.880]  that further down in the same document here's US version B of what they want to
[40:36.880 --> 40:41.080]  do we'll have a multiple choice question here for people when they tell us which
[40:41.080 --> 40:44.120]  one of these things they buy they say they intercepted intelligence and
[40:44.120 --> 40:50.360]  that's what we just said from Hilary Leverett Hilary man Leverett that they
[40:50.360 --> 40:54.440]  don't send their plans out by phone but in this particular one they're
[40:54.440 --> 40:59.200]  essentially saying that they have intelligence that leads us to assess
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.720]  that Syrian chemical weapons personnel we're preparing chemical munitions prior
[41:03.720 --> 41:08.040]  to the attack three days prior to the attack we collected streams of human
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.080]  signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we
[41:12.080 --> 41:16.120]  assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack now this
[41:16.120 --> 41:20.840]  was something that was leaked by foreign policy on Friday actually I think it
[41:20.840 --> 41:25.240]  came out on Saturday and the question that first came up in everybody's minds
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.040]  was that if they had this information and they said that they had it three days
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.080]  ahead of time that they had all this intelligence that they had intercepted
[41:33.080 --> 41:36.480]  and that they observed and they saw people moving they knew gas masks are
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.560]  being put out by the Syrians well the question people are asking is why didn't
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.720]  you tell anybody in these towns they were very specific about where they saw
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.360]  this they said and this is the White House statement Syrian chemical weapon
[41:49.360 --> 41:55.360]  personnel were operating in the Damascus suburb of Adra from Sunday August 18
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.840]  until early the next morning on Wednesday August 21st so they're saying for three
[41:59.840 --> 42:03.360]  days they were observing this and yet they didn't tell anybody there so you
[42:03.360 --> 42:08.280]  have Razan Zaitouneh an oppositionist an opposition activist in the town of
[42:08.280 --> 42:11.440]  Douma one of the towns hit in the August 21st attack according to foreign
[42:11.440 --> 42:17.920]  policy said that she had no indication of a major chemical attack she said when
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.120]  it hit we thought it was unusual and limited not strong and it's unbelievable
[42:22.120 --> 42:26.560]  that they would not warn people or try to stop the regime see that's the very
[42:26.560 --> 42:30.560]  if that is true if what the White House is saying is true here they're
[42:30.560 --> 42:37.480]  admitting that they did a false flag see a false flag is not necessarily staging
[42:37.480 --> 42:41.320]  or planning or creating the attack that can be a false flag a false flag can
[42:41.320 --> 42:46.440]  also be if you understand that somebody else is going to do it and you keep it
[42:46.440 --> 42:51.040]  secret because you're gonna you're gonna use that for political purposes so if
[42:51.040 --> 42:55.080]  the United States government if what they said and the White House document
[42:55.080 --> 43:00.240]  here that they knew three days in advance is true then they're guilty of not
[43:00.240 --> 43:03.120]  only allowing these people to die because they didn't do anything but
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.760]  also using it as a false flag then we have the Israeli version and this is
[43:07.760 --> 43:13.320]  also referenced in the White House report the Israeli version says that they
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.080]  have evidence that incriminates the Assad regime because they intercepted
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.720]  communications by US intelligence I'm sorry by Israeli intelligence that
[43:23.720 --> 43:28.720]  indicated that some lower level people shot this and there was a lot of chatter
[43:28.720 --> 43:33.880]  from higher ups saying what are you doing confusion telling them to stand
[43:33.880 --> 43:38.440]  down so they said well it looks like it was done by somebody at a low level not
[43:38.440 --> 43:42.280]  by the Assad regime but of course they're responsible for everything that
[43:42.280 --> 43:46.440]  people lower down do unlike the Obama administration right they're not
[43:46.440 --> 43:49.840]  responsible for anything that happens at the IRS or in these other agencies and
[43:49.840 --> 43:55.360]  other rogue actions that are taken with fast and furious none of that ever goes
[43:55.360 --> 44:01.080]  back to the this administration and that is also referenced in the White House
[44:01.080 --> 44:07.680]  report that contradicts the first report right the first report says oh we
[44:07.680 --> 44:11.920]  have information that this is being planned three days in advance then they
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.320]  come in and they pull in the Israeli quote-unquote intelligence which says
[44:16.320 --> 44:20.680]  oh this was accidentally done by somebody at a lower level was it an accident
[44:20.680 --> 44:25.520]  or was it planned well the White House regime wants to tell us it was a both
[44:25.520 --> 44:31.360]  okay then we have a report that was exclusive from Info Wars where we have
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.320]  an AP NPR BBC correspondent someone who's done reports for all those
[44:36.320 --> 44:41.280]  organizations a very credible correspondent Dale Gavlik she went to
[44:41.280 --> 44:46.640]  the area and she interviewed villagers there what they told her was that the
[44:46.640 --> 44:50.840]  Saudis had given them weapons of mass destruction they weren't sure that they
[44:50.840 --> 44:54.000]  they didn't know that they were these are chemical weapons they didn't know how
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.800]  to handle them these people were telling this reporter that it was an
[44:57.800 --> 45:03.280]  accidental discharge yet another version final version we're going to go over and
[45:03.280 --> 45:08.920]  that is hacked emails now this just surfaced yesterday we have someone who
[45:08.920 --> 45:15.880]  hacked into the email accounts of an army intelligence colonel and Anthony
[45:15.880 --> 45:22.000]  let's see what's his name here Anthony J. McDonald and he has a LinkedIn
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.440]  account and when I went to verify that his LinkedIn account has been removed
[45:27.440 --> 45:33.160]  now but it's been cashed and you can see his cashed account if you look him up on
[45:33.160 --> 45:36.880]  YouTube and you can see that yes indeed he was involved with the Defense
[45:36.880 --> 45:41.800]  Intelligence Agency at a very high level he was in Afghanistan he was involved in
[45:41.800 --> 45:46.600]  counterintelligence he was involved in human intelligence and what this hacker
[45:46.600 --> 45:53.280]  came up with were some emails that were very incriminating what he had was some
[45:53.280 --> 46:00.160]  correspondence between Colonel McDonald and a person named Eugene first and in
[46:00.160 --> 46:05.760]  this correspondence Eugene writes to the colonel and says by the way I saw your
[46:05.760 --> 46:13.080]  latest success my congratulations good job and he links this article from the
[46:13.080 --> 46:17.600]  Washington Post which says that Syrian activists are accusing the government of
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.760]  deadly chemical attack near Damascus now that was the article from August the
[46:21.760 --> 46:29.520]  21st in that article there was nothing about any kind of PR I don't know why
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.760]  he would be congratulating him on this this is simply stating what they knew
[46:34.760 --> 46:39.040]  at the time that there had been a gas attack what they believed at the time
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.000]  was a gas attack that chemical weapons had been launched in the Damascus suburb
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.440]  it's a very matter-of-fact dry statement a news report and it said that some
[46:48.440 --> 46:53.080]  people were blaming it on Syrian rebels if confirmed use of toxic agents would be
[46:53.080 --> 46:57.320]  the most serious in decade that sort of thing this was the August the 21st report
[46:57.320 --> 47:01.800]  from the Washington Post so this person writes this Colonel and says by the way
[47:01.800 --> 47:07.360]  I saw your latest success my congratulations good job he replies to
[47:07.360 --> 47:13.120]  the Colonel he says as you see I'm far from this now but I know our guys did
[47:13.120 --> 47:18.040]  their best so there was nothing in that article about Americans doing anything
[47:18.040 --> 47:22.360]  there was nothing in that article about Americans characterizing anything or
[47:22.360 --> 47:27.200]  doing any research or being present there he says I enjoy catching up with
[47:27.200 --> 47:33.320]  you hope to see you again soon that's very very suspicious then combine that
[47:33.320 --> 47:38.160]  with an email from his wife who is corresponding he also hacked into some
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.360]  email accounts from his wife she's corresponding to a friend and in this
[47:42.360 --> 47:46.680]  particular case what she says is his friend is writing her and there's a lot
[47:46.680 --> 47:50.080]  of personal information and at the end she says you know I can't stop thinking
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.640]  about that terrible gas attack in Syria now did you see those kids I was really
[47:54.640 --> 48:00.480]  crying they were poisoned they died when is it over I can see their faces when I
[48:00.480 --> 48:05.640]  sleep what did Tony say to you about this and she writes back and she says I
[48:05.640 --> 48:11.160]  saw it and I got very afraid I got afraid very much but Tony comforted me he
[48:11.160 --> 48:17.520]  said the kids weren't hurt it was done for the cameras you hear that her Colonel
[48:17.520 --> 48:22.280]  who is an Army counterintelligence in Afghanistan very high-level Colonel he's
[48:22.280 --> 48:25.640]  been in for quite a while he if you look at his resume that you can still see on
[48:25.640 --> 48:31.400]  LinkedIn he's very well connected he said the kids weren't hurt it was done
[48:31.400 --> 48:38.720]  for the cameras so don't worry my dear then a follow-up message from her friend
[48:38.720 --> 48:44.680]  that says you see I'm still thinking about those Syrian kids thank God they're
[48:44.680 --> 48:51.800]  live I hope they got some kind of a present or some cash well that's
[48:51.800 --> 48:56.520]  interesting okay let's take some phone calls let's go to Chris and Georgia
[48:56.520 --> 48:59.920]  Chris what do you think of this what's your what do you think about this
[48:59.920 --> 49:07.040]  Syrian attack hi you guys are doing a great job I gotta say though someone on
[49:07.040 --> 49:11.760]  the show you have to have a good discussion about Zionism and I'm not
[49:11.760 --> 49:15.880]  one of those I'm not one of those that say it's time to pack up there's a real
[49:15.880 --> 49:20.240]  and send everyone back to Poland and Russia I don't think like that it's
[49:20.240 --> 49:26.920]  just that the historical antecedents of the creation of Israel are much more
[49:26.920 --> 49:33.760]  important to this and a lot of your listeners may have realized that's one
[49:33.760 --> 49:39.840]  reason but then also the other reason to have this discussion is because there
[49:39.840 --> 49:46.240]  are a lot of people that are wondering about Alex's treatment of Israel if you
[49:46.240 --> 49:51.920]  know what I mean and it would really behoove the show to have one good long
[49:51.920 --> 49:58.480]  hour discussion on that subject the pros and cons the difference between
[49:58.480 --> 50:03.640]  Zionism and Judaism because they're absolutely not the same thing right I
[50:03.640 --> 50:08.560]  understand I understand and I can tell you from from here that you know I've
[50:08.560 --> 50:14.760]  been here a year and this is this is we're not shills for Zionists anything
[50:14.760 --> 50:19.240]  but and you know Zionism is something that you know people there's a lot of
[50:19.240 --> 50:23.680]  people who are fundamentalist Christians who are born again Christians who are
[50:23.680 --> 50:28.080]  people who believe they're taking the Bible literally and they basically want
[50:28.080 --> 50:32.400]  to give a blank check to anything that the government of Israel does and you
[50:32.400 --> 50:36.360]  know here at info wars we don't just because we're pushing back on this war
[50:36.360 --> 50:41.120]  in Syria doesn't mean we're siding with the Syrians and as I mentioned just
[50:41.120 --> 50:45.920]  here this intelligence that we got from Israel I don't find that at all credible
[50:45.920 --> 50:49.360]  so yes there's a difference between the Israeli government and between Judaism
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.320]  we understand that we'll be right back right after the break stay tuned
[50:59.960 --> 51:03.840]  September is National Preparedness Month that's right we like to call it

[54:08.520 --> 54:14.120]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Labor Day Alex is going to be
[54:14.120 --> 54:19.160]  joining us at the midpoint of the show at about 12 30 central time but and he's
[54:19.160 --> 54:23.280]  going to have a special report about the sea change that is happening this is
[54:23.280 --> 54:28.120]  dramatic dramatic what happened last week the British Parliament rejected the
[54:28.120 --> 54:31.920]  Prime Minister for the first time in a couple hundred years and we had Obama
[54:31.920 --> 54:36.800]  blink and say he's actually going to talk to Congress this is something that
[54:36.800 --> 54:43.680]  we saw Panetta with Senator Jeff Sessions just say we're not gonna it's a
[54:43.680 --> 54:47.600]  confirmation here so we're not gonna bother to get congressional approval we
[54:47.600 --> 54:51.480]  may talk to NATO we may talk to UN but we don't really need to get congressional
[54:51.480 --> 54:54.800]  approval and then you had the same thing happen with John Kerry during his
[54:54.800 --> 54:58.720]  confirmation hearings from Rand Paul Rand Paul asking these questions and
[54:58.720 --> 55:04.160]  of course the president can call up the military if the United States is attacked
[55:04.160 --> 55:09.760]  or if there is an imminent attack that is not the case what they're trying to do
[55:09.760 --> 55:15.320]  is make a case for us to get involved in a Syrian civil war on the side of Al
[55:15.320 --> 55:19.520]  Qaeda and you've got people in the military pushing back all over social
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.280]  media so Alex Jones is going to be in at the bottom of the next hour and he's
[55:23.280 --> 55:27.280]  going to be talking about this major sea change and the danger that is involved
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.800]  because the government at this point they are losing so badly losing the
[55:31.800 --> 55:36.600]  narrative so badly they may in fact do a big false flag they may do something
[55:36.600 --> 55:41.400]  here to try to win public support as a last resort now the sponsor for this

[56:17.440 --> 56:21.200]  now we've got some of your calls lined up here and in the last segment we talked
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.280]  about all the different different things that we're being fed by the White
[56:26.280 --> 56:29.160]  House they've got several different versions several different narratives
[56:29.160 --> 56:32.720]  they can they contradict themselves one of the narratives that they have is
[56:32.720 --> 56:36.360]  well we knew three days in advance that they were going to attack yet they
[56:36.360 --> 56:39.600]  didn't tell anybody they didn't do anything to stop anyone then they
[56:39.600 --> 56:42.800]  further go down and then they say that they got intelligence from the
[56:42.800 --> 56:47.520]  Israelis that said that this was an accident at a lower level so those two
[56:47.520 --> 56:53.400]  contradict each other we also have information firsthand report from a AP
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.000]  NPR BBC correspondent Dale Gavleck that we've carried here exclusively at
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.120]  Infowars not too many people have picked this up but she actually went in and
[57:01.120 --> 57:05.600]  talked to people they believe that it was nerve gas that was supplied to them
[57:05.600 --> 57:11.240]  by the Saudis they did not know what was in the armaments they didn't know how
[57:11.240 --> 57:14.120]  to handle them properly and they accidentally exploded and then we have
[57:14.120 --> 57:19.840]  another version that it was actually a staged version it appears from
[57:19.840 --> 57:25.160]  correspondents and hacked emails from a high-ranking Army Colonel Colonel
[57:25.160 --> 57:29.640]  Anthony McDonald so we want to go to your calls and and see what you think
[57:29.640 --> 57:33.240]  which one of these multiple choice which one of these is the reason for us to go
[57:33.240 --> 57:37.240]  to war and do you think we ought to go to war if you believe these are true or
[57:37.240 --> 57:41.960]  as James Clapper would say the least untruthful of these which which of these
[57:41.960 --> 57:47.320]  do you think is the least untruthful bill in California
[57:47.320 --> 57:54.080]  hello it is sure a pleasure to have a sane man behind the microphone but I'd
[57:54.080 --> 58:02.320]  have to say none of the above as far as the reasons we don't know what the
[58:02.320 --> 58:09.600]  reason is somebody leaned on both England France and America to do it but we
[58:09.600 --> 58:19.440]  don't know it's time to get more pressure on our elected representatives
[58:19.440 --> 58:23.920]  that's right we're coming up across here I agree we're coming up to the
[58:23.920 --> 58:27.760]  break sorry but that's a vote for none of the above and we're going to take some
[58:27.760 --> 58:32.840]  more calls on the other side of the hour we write back at Info Wars for Alex
[58:32.840 --> 58:37.120]  Jones and he's gonna be joining us at the bottom of the hour

[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:23.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:31.080]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Labor Day 2013 and the news is all
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.960]  about Syria and about the sea change that we see happening people have had
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.840]  enough of the false narrative you know it's changed from 70% in favor of the
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:48.320]  Iraq war which was now we know based on lies and twisted intelligence and the
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.440]  American public is basically woken up to that thanks to info wars the
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:57.800]  alternative media today it is 90% against a complete change from 70% for
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:06.320]  to 90% against and that's that 70% was BS that was before Snowden but of
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.000]  course it wasn't this didn't all just happen with Snowden what I did was that
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.200]  validated and verified what info wars and others in the alternative media have
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.640]  been telling the public about our criminal government violating the
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:25.120]  Constitution you know it was right after September 11th in 2001 that you had four
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:31.520]  NSA employees become whistleblowers and talk about the fact that the government
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:39.960]  was going to a broad-based surveillance of the American public and they fought
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:46.640]  against the government doing that they went through proper channels they but
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.400]  they were still persecuted by the government one of them was prosecuted
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.720]  but beat that prosecution but that narrative never got any attention
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.320]  finally finally when Ed Snowden did it that got attention but it verified what
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.800]  we've been telling everybody even before those whistleblowers came out it was
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.200]  clear what was happening this is people have had indications that the
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.720]  government has been spying on all of our communications going back for decades
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.720]  but it just keeps keeps building and with the Snowden affair it got really large
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.200]  and there's an image that's just come out that's on the Daily Mail the image
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.080]  John Kerry won't want you to see US Secretary of State pictured dining with
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.880]  Assad and his wife at a Damascus restaurant before the war broke out in
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.600]  Syria yes this is the man as they point out that John Kerry this this last
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:42.320]  weekend characterized as being the same as Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein we
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.640]  see him dining with that same individual it's kind of like you know
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:53.720]  remember al alaki the American citizen who was killed by a drone attack without
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.040]  a trial without being convicted of anything he was someone who repeatedly
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:06.880]  was giving presentations at the Pentagon who was actually a CIA agent like most
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:12.840]  of Al Qaeda and yet he was shot down with a drone and his teenage son who was
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.120]  never involved in anything was shot with a drone there wasn't any imminent
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.360]  danger to the United States from him he was essentially someone who was
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.800]  involved in the writing area in the propaganda area if you will of Al Qaeda
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:32.640]  he was not a arm-carrying troop but they shot and killed him just as Obama
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:39.920]  killed three on Saturday and six on Friday Al Qaeda presumably we don't have
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.560]  any word yet how many innocent people were killed with those drone strikes I
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:50.520]  guess those Al Qaeda were bad Al Qaeda unlike the good Al Qaeda in Syria I
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.240]  guess those were a wall Al Qaeda they were Al Qaeda without leave they were
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.920]  not where they were supposed to be which is in Syria fighting the regime that
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.480]  used to be our best buddies just looks more and more like Iraq all the time
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.360]  doesn't it and we had someone who was in the Bush administration who pointed that
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.640]  out on MSNBC we played a clip in the last hour and she was making the case
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.480]  how this looks more and more like what happened in the build-up to war we've
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.720]  got some callers on the line and we want to hear what you have to say about
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.600]  this but we're gonna come to that right after the break because we don't have
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:33.320]  too much time here we do have breaking news going on it's not just not just the
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:40.080]  NSA that's spying on people we have the DEA and it is eclipsing the NSA
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.160]  according to the New York Times it is dwarfing anything that they did and of

[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.280]  joining us at the bottom of the hour and he's got a special report on the major
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:37.520]  sea change that is happening and we had a we've got an article up on info wars
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.760]  dot com this is actually something that was from Ben Swan and we've got some
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:48.440]  protesters who are out protesting the war they've got Ben Swan signs they've
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.200]  also got info wars t-shirts take a look at this if you're watching on this let's
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.560]  let's run that video we don't don't think we really need to get the audio on it
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.720]  they're out there protesting and what happens what makes this newsworthy I
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.680]  guess is that they get approached by a policeman who tells them that they don't
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.200]  have a permit to protest and the protesters not only know what's going
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:16.620]  on in Syria but they know their rights and they said we have a permit is in the
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:21.060]  Constitution for right to peacefully assemble there you go you got a cop
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.240]  there you got a guy with info wars shirt you got another guy holding up a Ben
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.440]  Swan sign this is about the alternative media waking people up this is the sea
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.240]  change that is happening this is what Alex Jones is going to be talking about
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.000]  at the bottom of the hour people are waking up these are not a bunch of
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.840]  college kids with time on their hands like you saw in the 1960s these are what
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.280]  we'd like a better term would call middle-class Americans who are out on
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.600]  their weekends protesting the war because they oppose it on so many different
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.760]  levels on moral levels on at a legal level that violates the Constitution
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.760]  even on a fiscal level here we're told that the US is bankrupt we're having to
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.440]  borrow money from China so we can launch missiles into Syria is this crazy
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.920]  this absolutely insane this is going to be hundreds of millions of dollars for
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.920]  this so-called surgical strike that's going to kill a lot of people a lot
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.880]  more people than they're claiming were killed in the Syrian attack and you know
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:24.120]  even that even that was phony they referred to the statistics from doctors
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.840]  without borders and the doctors without borders pushed back on this and said all
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.360]  we did was say that it that the videos that we saw showed signs that were
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:41.080]  consistent with a neurotoxin attack and the casualty figure that they came up
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:47.920]  with was 355 but what they said the US regime did was went through and cherry
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.520]  picked information out of that report that's what they objected to they cherry
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:55.440]  picked information out of that they spun it then they went with a really high
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.840]  casualty figure of over 1400 that was being supplied to them by the rebels and
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.800]  the Red Cross is pushing back against this false narrative to everybody
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:11.760]  is aware of the tactics that the American government has is using and they
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.280]  don't change we've talked about how with false flags are always running drills
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.160]  that when they do it in the US like they did in the Boston Marathon they're
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.080]  always running drills are always that gives them cover in case they get caught
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.280]  it also creates confusion because people don't know if it's real or if it's a
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:31.360]  false flag attack or if it's just a drill so they do certain things like that
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.680]  with these false flags they have a MO a method of operation that they do over and
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:41.080]  over again when they want to start a war they have the same sort of little MO
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.680]  they go in and claim that they've got to come in for humanitarian reasons because
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.440]  babies have been pulled out of incubators or because there's been a gas
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:54.200]  attack or whatever or the the regime that they're going after has weapons of
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.920]  mass destruction they always use the same type of template it's just just a
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.520]  cutout thing and then we find out later that this is this this woman who's
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.240]  talking and crying in a congressional testimony about babies being taken out
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.360]  of incubators that she's a daughter of an ambassador that she wasn't there we
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.840]  find out that the weapons of mass destruction didn't exist that they
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.040]  twisted that narrative we're finding out similar things with this as well when
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.160]  you look at the White House documented their justification for war they even
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.080]  contradict themselves at one point of the document they say that it's because
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.120]  they had intelligence three days ahead of time that the administration was
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:34.320]  planning this then they refer to some intelligence that came from the Israeli
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.560]  government that says that no in fact we got intelligence that the
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.520]  administration was surprised that this happened and we heard phone calls where
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.800]  they were going back and saying what are you doing stand down so they even
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.160]  contradict themselves in that phony narrative they talk about how well they
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.200]  know this is for real because they have so many YouTube videos that they saw of
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.640]  it and of course the Syrians couldn't fake YouTube videos but then we have an
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.920]  email that was hacked from a high-ranking military colonel in the US Army an
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.280]  Anthony McDonald and this hacker got into his LinkedIn account you can still
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.040]  see his LinkedIn account cached on Google and you can see that he was in
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.880]  fact a very high-level intelligence officer in Afghanistan working in
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:25.320]  counterintelligence working in human intelligence and there's a series of
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.840]  emails between him and someone else that essentially make this look like it
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:36.000]  was a false flag makes it look like it was staged an email from a friend of
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.440]  his wife to his wife said she was really really upset about the pictures that she
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.520]  saw the children dying and the wife of this colonel says don't worry he told
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.800]  me it was all staged that nobody died and the other one says oh I'm so glad and
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.040]  relieved to hear that I hope they got some prizes or some cash for that so
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.840]  that is a real eye-opener that just broke yesterday so we want to take your
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.680]  calls and we've got some people here online and I'd like to know what you
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.760]  think I mean is this something that was totally faked by the United States
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.440]  government was this something that was organized by the United States government
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:17.760]  and the rebels or organized by the rebels and the Saudis for example or did the
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.960]  Americans know that this is going to happen allow it to happen so they could
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:28.000]  use it for the military industrial complex creating another war or were they
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.600]  right all along was it really the Syrian government were they really did they
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.840]  really say you know what we're winning on the battlefield so let's just for the
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.880]  heck of it let's just drop some bombs because we know the Americans will
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.080]  attack us and it'll get a little bit more interesting and more challenging Ed
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.380]  in New York what do you think do you which of those you think is as James
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:55.080]  Clapper would say the least untruthful Ed in New York right there I think we
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:04.120]  lost Ed in New York let's go to Lauren in Ohio sorry oh Ed okay I think we're
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.440]  getting some feedback on your radio do you have a little bit of feedback from
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.800]  the prison planet TV okay can you rephrase the question again yeah yeah
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.600]  which of those do you think is least untruthful do you think that the US
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.840]  government faked it do you think they aided it do you think that the Syrians
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.160]  actually did it I believe that they are I think yeah I think it's like they in
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:31.960]  the middle I think they are it's that they aided it it didn't actually carry
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.320]  out the attack although I wouldn't put anything past the CIA these days of a
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:42.040]  thought but um obviously uh like uh one of the questions that the judges used
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:48.920]  to ask in Rome was quibono which means who benefits when you want to see if
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.720]  you if you want to understand the motivation you want to understand who
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:56.120]  was really behind or police would have been dorks have supported an attack like
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.640]  this I would say just ask that question and always usually always leave your
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.040]  right to the answer and who do you think benefits from a war in Syria do you
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.200]  think it helps the people you know we're told we have to do this for
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.560]  humanitarian reasons we're told that we had 1,400 people killed so we should do
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:16.840]  a major missile strike against them to teach them a lesson do you think that
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.040]  benefits the Syrian people does that benefit the American people like
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.880]  propaganda you know some peace missiles and you know show them your love that's
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.080]  right the most ridiculous thing I ever heard especially when the Assad regime
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.360]  is far less violent than as Rand Paul said earlier today than the Al Qaeda
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.440]  rebels could ever be I mean it's mind-boggling how we can be supporting
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.520]  the same people who attacked us on 9-11 you know right well but you know that
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.520]  that CNN was running this through all on Friday when it looks like it's gonna
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.640]  happen on Saturday they're running this through and they were talking about what
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.720]  a surgical strike it was going to be how accurate these missiles are going to be
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.920]  in other words nobody but you know they're gonna find mysteriously find
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.200]  all the bad guys and not hurt anybody else I do you believe that no it sounds
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.760]  just like the those drone strikes right right even the drone strikes I mean
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.960]  they're not that big of bombs but even the drone strikes have killed score have
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.200]  killed thousands of innocent people thousands of innocent people well yeah
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.760]  listen I just want to let you guys know that I think you're doing a wonderful
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.600]  job especially recently um it really helped when the NSA weeks came out of
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.000]  you mentioned you know just people about my job people my age I'm only 22 year
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.800]  I'm 23 now I know I'm just a waiter I work at the catering
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.920]  hall out here and I had a couple of guys most of them were veterans you know
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.640]  we're bartenders that we're pretty much aware of what was going on I didn't
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.400]  even really get I have to say I am fortunately voted for Obama in 2008
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.200]  2012 I only got into this pretty recently the Piers Morgan interview helped a lot
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.760]  yeah that's how I found Alex Jones and um good I want to tell you that the young
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.240]  the younger generations waking up you know I had people come to me after the
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.840]  NSA weeks and they realized I wasn't really that out of my mind yeah and now
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.680]  again with this I said it's only 90% of the 90% of the American population is
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.160]  against war in Syria had a couple of my co-workers say you know where where you
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.240]  get an oldest information from it seems like it's checking out that's why I
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.040]  showed them the UN inspector or that is the least tentative that the rebels
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.120]  are committed to tax and I showed them info wars natural news I even gave them
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.960]  a blade you know we we have to work out as well with that but yeah exactly we
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.200]  have to document our stuff so much more carefully because it's a different
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.400]  narrative than they're hearing from the mainstream media if you listen to CNN
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:38.920]  what you hear is all this stuff about how they're going to do surgical strikes
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.800]  we're asking the questions like who benefits from this like you just
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.080]  mentioned we're asking why would we do this where do we get the information
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.760]  about this and why are we doing this when it was only back in May that you had
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:55.040]  you and inspectors going there saying it was the rebels who used sarin gas and
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.200]  they did it as a false flag trying to draw the United States today was that
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:05.680]  within USA today that was reported in a lot of different media that was back in
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:12.480]  May and we also had a former Bush administration person who was her name
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.600]  was Hilary Mann Leverett and she was pointing out the fact that what they
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.400]  learned when I went in and tested in May they knew that this was not the Syrian
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.600]  government these were not that the missiles that were used were not missiles
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.040]  that were military industrial you know they were homemade missiles as well as
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.960]  the sarin gas itself was homemade and we know that that can be done homemade
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.800]  because that's what happened in Japan what you were talking about it is
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.120]  exactly what Alex is going to be talking about he's going to be here at the

[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.680]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.400]  momentarily Alex is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour he's got a
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:31.080]  special report about what happened this weekend with Obama essentially backing
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:35.320]  down from striking unilaterally without congressional support without
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:40.280]  constitutional authority it is a sea change it is something that we saw
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.720]  happening all over the world but especially here in the US because if
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.680]  you've noticed what's happening on the social media we've got soldiers and
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:52.000]  sailors all over the place putting up signs saying they're not going to go
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.600]  get involved they didn't enlist to get involved in a Syrian civil war and fight
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.360]  on the side of al-qaeda so Alex is going to be talking about that talking
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.240]  about how people are waking up because of info wars and the rest of the
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:09.760]  alternative media we're seeing people getting getting essentially tired and
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.800]  fed up of being lied to about what's going on and being manipulated by the
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:20.080]  government you know we had 72% of the people who supported the Iraq war that
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.560]  was a war that was based on lies and now people have woken up to that same
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.880]  tactic they're still using incredibly they're still using the very same tactic
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.520]  but I want to tell you about a couple of things here we've got our sponsor for
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.500]  the for this hour is supernatural silver you know antibiotics are getting
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:42.840]  ineffective because they're being overused and misused but new supernatural
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.840]  silver offers a safe and effective means of killing pathogens where antibiotics
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.000]  and other drugs are failing you know this is something that has been used for
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.640]  a very very long time people have known that if you put silver in wounds you can
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.960]  kill bacteria silver pitchers were not just beautiful but they had a very
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:04.720]  functional use supernatural silver is a way that you can protect your family and
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.120]  yourself go to supernaturalsilver.com and use a promo code Alex says for a
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.120]  20% discount and also we have the new info wars magazine which just came out
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.280]  this is the cover is really appropriate and so Obama says thou shalt not have
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:28.480]  any other gods above the state and in so many ways that is true take a look at
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.360]  this this recent story this is something that is happening right now that
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.320]  illustrates that essentially this is a a German home school family and that
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:43.320]  really is the attitude in Germany they want to get the children at a very
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.120]  early age government schooling essentially was pioneered in Germany
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.560]  kindergarten that sort of thing has been there for centuries it's thoroughly
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.560]  ingrained and of course when the Nazis took over all they had to do was to
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.960]  change the curriculum so as long as you've got a government infrastructure
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.480]  there to brainwash children at an early age the government can use that any way
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:09.560]  that they see fit and so the German government and even other governments in
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:14.440]  Sweden are very very intolerant very authoritarian of anybody who wants to
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.800]  take their children out of school and of course what they're having a conflict
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:22.240]  with are Christians in those schools because they don't like the religion
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.280]  that's being taught in the schools that's right the schools are not just
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.200]  secular they are teaching a religion you know atheism and secularism is a
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.560]  religion you know it's not a question of whether religion is going to be taught
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.600]  it's not a question of what whose values or whether or not values are going to be
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:42.120]  taught it's just a question of which religion and whose values are going to
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:47.960]  be taught and so what you had was simply a family in Germany the Ramaki family
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.200]  that wanted to homeschool their children and they were threatened with having
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.240]  their children taken away they escaped from Germany came to the United States
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.720]  were given asylum in Tennessee by a judge in 2010 and then a little over two
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:08.200]  years later homeland security homeland security came after them and the
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.840]  Holder administration the Eric Holder's Justice Department that regime has been
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.480]  trying to get them thrown out I find it interesting that it started with
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.800]  Homeland Security and not with immigration it's Homeland Security who came
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:26.000]  after these homeschoolers and of course we've seen some very disturbing briefs
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.560]  filed on the part of Eric Holder in the Justice Department saying that freedom
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:38.240]  of religion is not a justification for them to be to be able to homeschool
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:43.440]  very very disturbing you know it doesn't really mean anything to have a
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.240]  First Amendment that says we have freedom of speech and that we have
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.600]  freedom of religion if we don't have freedom of education because education
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:55.000]  is about both of those issues if you are going to say that we don't have freedom
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.840]  of education you're going to be infringing on people's freedom of speech
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:01.540]  their freedom of thought and on the values that they're trying to teach their
[01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:06.320]  children I homeschooled both of my sons and I can tell you I can tell you that
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.080]  they have a very different understanding of history and political science than
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.000]  they would if they had been taught by the government what you see in the
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  government schools is an education of the government by the government and for
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  the government and that's not what you're going to get at home we're going
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.720]  to be right back and Alex is going to talk about this sea change that is
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.760]  happening that we saw as Obama backed down be right back with Alex Jones stay

[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:53.520]  host Alex Jones David Knight is hosting most of the broadcast today I will be
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:00.640]  here until midnight tonight on Labor Day working on Obama deception to with my
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:10.080]  great film crew Rob Jacobson Darren McBrain and of course Rob do and I want
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.080]  to say great job of the crew in here today working as well on the radio side
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:19.280]  as well as one of our informers nightly news host David Knight we are here Monday
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:28.800]  through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. central standard time the information
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:36.600]  I'm about to cover is so unbelievably momentous that I want to be clear here I
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:44.480]  do not feel worthy to bring you this information all the facets the depth the
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:54.280]  breadth the multivariate multifaceted systems that bring me to the 100%
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:35:01.120]  ironclad conclusion that we are on the verge of the collapse of this current
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:07.880]  incarnation of the New World Order now to be clear there will still be the same
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:13.680]  power structures in place at many levels to be clear the general population of
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.400]  the West because we've had so much Liberty has had incredible plenty so we
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:24.440]  become very very decadent and so the problem of general corruption and general
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:33.120]  evil will still be there but as for the current power structure that is in place
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:40.840]  driving the dominant global system of the three power structures that are
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:47.200]  present in the geopolitical system the Anglo-American establishment is
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:55.000]  basically on fire exploding and is a ship now listing at about 90 degrees and
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.360]  about to go under and I'll be honest with you the only way they're going to be
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:08.880]  able to avert fully capsizing and then sinking and breaking up on the surface
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:18.800]  is staging the false flag attacks the order of magnitude so huge that I don't
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.240]  believe even that will get them out of it because the understanding of false
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:34.520]  flag is now so widespread so ubiquitous as you know in the last few months I
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:40.400]  have made the point that when I run into military on the streets in California in
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:51.920]  Texas in Arkansas in Florida in DC in England places I've been in the last
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:37:01.880]  year half the military and police in many cases that I walk by wink at me and
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:07.520]  say we're awake we know what's going on we're not bad we're just waiting for the
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:13.720]  right cue to take action and they'll say what do you think that is and I'll say
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.440]  I don't know and they'll say that's why we really respect you because you don't
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:25.360]  just sit up there and make stuff up let me tell you it's very humbling very
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.680]  very humbling to know that the armed services of the United States a large
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:36.760]  portion of them listen to this broadcast every week and I have talked about the
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:43.680]  fact before it came out three weeks ago that the Pentagon the higher level you
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.240]  get them the higher percentage it's well over 50% that listen to this
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:54.360]  broadcast every single day and that absolutely freaks out the globalists
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.280]  that have hijacked our country now I'm not trying to make this incredible news
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.440]  I'm about to cover about info wars calm or about Alex Jones it's just it's a
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:13.120]  fact and we are in the middle of it and we also need your prayers and contrary
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:21.560]  you know to it making me become arrogant and hubris filled it is extremely
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:32.520]  extremely waiting on my spirit the responsibility we have and when you're
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.960]  trying to break down something this big it's it's it's it's very very hard
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.200]  because there's so many facets to it so let me just do this let me try to just
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.280]  break down what's happened and then I'll go through and back up the
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.480]  information I'm going to cover I tend to never get to my full presentations
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:57.160]  because I will focus in on each strata area of the larger program but here's
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:01.760]  the bottom line humanity wants to be free humanity has an incredible survival
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.280]  instinct and they may have dumbed it out of the general public because they've
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:10.400]  had it good for so long they have not dumbed it out of killers they have not
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.720]  dumbed it out of the military they have not dumbed it out of the tacticians they
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:20.760]  have not dumbed it out of the strategist and most of the strategist and
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:26.680]  killers and tacticians and special forces type people are not evil they have
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.720]  been manipulated they have been brainwashed and they're now
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:35.640]  decompartmentalized and aware of it and they are not even angry they're trying
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:42.840]  to figure out how to save this country and that's why I've been willing to
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:48.880]  risk my name my treasure everything but I I quite frankly can't believe our
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:55.920]  success is so devastating I mean if you studied this like I do 18 hours a day
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.840]  ladies and gentlemen when I intellectually look at this and see what's
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:05.520]  coming out of my electrochemical computer the the the equations the answers
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:12.640]  the the political sense the the the the gestalt that my brain and all the other
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.120]  intellectuals I talked to and people that study political systems they're
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.040]  coming to the same conclusion as well and again Info Wars is a large part of
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:25.000]  this but thank God there's many others that are prominent as well this is a
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:33.760]  very dangerous position to be in the New World Order is melting down right now
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:40.480]  and the scary thing is historically when when tyrants start losing on the
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.880]  western front they turn east when Napoleon starts losing in Europe he
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:51.280]  turns into Russia when Hitler starts losing in North Africa and and against
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:41:01.240]  England and the US he turned east into Russia when when when Romans
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.320]  historically began to lose some of their conflicts they'd launch even more
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:12.520]  wars that's the instinct of bullies that have learned to dominate their answer
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:17.440]  is to double down and so I want to be clear here before I get into the big
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:23.440]  news I'm breaking down the reason we're in so much danger is because we are
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:28.080]  basically now not just in the fight against the New World Order we've now
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:34.320]  gained the initiative we've basically torn the nose off the globalist they are
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:42.200]  on their knees right now politically seeing stars and we have got to move in
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:47.920]  and start stomping them politically to take them out or ladies and gentlemen
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:53.200]  they're going to supercharge and open up a can of false flag on us and we're
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:57.400]  going to be the ones on the ground I'm telling you right now they are looking
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.440]  at every angle with their supercomputers but they're fighting on an organic
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:07.440]  supercomputer of billions of humans who want freedom and so if we simply
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:14.720]  realize we can win and understand the battlescape and understand the the the
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:23.720]  political landscape and if we go on the initiative on the offensive we can shape
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:29.320]  the entire future battlescape and win we'll still have a lot of problems but
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.400]  we can really cripple the globalist then the globalist will start funding Russia
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.000]  and China and letting them do horrible stuff so they can then get us to give up
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.040]  our liberties again that's why the globalist said above the nations playing
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.600]  us all off against each other but the minute we figure that out and come
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.080]  together around a culture of liberty and honor and due process and anti-corruption
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:55.480]  and make the world economy about about who is trustworthy who is inventive who
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:00.560]  builds good products and have long-term relationships instead of the globalist
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:08.400]  gang relationship scam the minute we rediscover that it's over for them so
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:16.000]  I've given you some basics here what am I getting at what's so big the military
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.520]  is awakening to their duty the establishment has jumped the shark the
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:28.040]  world does not like seeing all the major militaries of the West ganged up on
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.960]  Syria for two and a half years injecting al-qaeda in there to commit
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.960]  unspeakable atrocities and blow up churches and make fathers commit
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:41.560]  suicide bombings or they kill them and the military knows this because the US
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:47.840]  military is there giving intel with drones and intel with satellites to the
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:55.480]  al-qaeda forces and being forced to train them in Jordan Iraq Turkey and
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:03.760]  Israel and so now this information is confirmed in the military they now know
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.160]  our information about how criminal elements of our government have been
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.680]  running al-qaeda all along there's now a mass epiphany that is already spread
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:24.400]  viral and there's no putting it back in the box even if the globalist stage new
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.720]  big events the process of unwinding this propaganda there's no putting the
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:37.480]  genie back in the bottle you have Pat Buchanan you have Ron Paul and now
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:43.880]  Rand Paul all coming out saying our government's running al-qaeda see I and
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:47.800]  others have made it safe for them to talk about the elephant the room the
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:58.200]  military is coming out in mass talking about it this is so historical and now
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:05.400]  Kerry said last week we don't need Congress yeah keep going through that
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.280]  keep showing people watching on TV all the military people saying I will not
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.880]  fight for al-qaeda in Syria and and holding up signs saying it by the
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.400]  thousands flooding Twitter and Facebook we have the article up on info wars
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:24.480]  calm talking to my crew here of your radio listener Kerry imagine the
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:27.720]  globalists come out they've been able to attack any country they want by
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:33.000]  staging attacks against our forces or staging attacks and then blaming it on
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.560]  their political enemies they've gotten away with this over and over and over
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.920]  again and now they tried to openly for two and a half years use al-qaeda in
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:50.960]  Libya Syria Egypt and other areas and now the Egyptian military has turned
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.480]  against them and is arresting the Muslim Brotherhood in al-qaeda and
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:58.760]  pointing out with documents that that our own criminal government has been
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.640]  funding them it's all coming out it's not just the Russians it's not just the
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.480]  European press it's our own military everybody is seeing it for what it is a
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:13.680]  menace to humanity and it's turning against it and if the globalists lose
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:21.440]  on this front they will lose on every front so Obama comes out Saturday comes
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.720]  out yesterday as well through his surrogates like Kerry and says okay
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:29.560]  we've decided we're gonna strike Syria they've already been striking them with
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:33.600]  surrogates for two and a half plus years but we're gonna go to Congress to get
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.120]  approval but then he has his surrogates come out and say Kerry yesterday we
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:44.280]  don't need to get approval but if you want to fine just like a year ago they
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:50.080]  said Congress wasn't over war anymore NATO was see it's about reclaiming due
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.560]  process and once it begins and once these bullies have been shown to be
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.640]  frauds just because they're wearing fancy suits and speaking from the Rose
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:03.680]  Garden or speaking from some gilded ivory tower doesn't mean they're better
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.840]  than us doesn't mean they aren't kleptocratic liars and so the veil is
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:13.000]  dropping similar and here's the key to what we saw with the fall of the Berlin
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.120]  wall in 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the fall of the Soviet
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:24.880]  Union was real because they had no more support they did try to regroup and
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.720]  still keep socialism and communism going but the fall was real it's just that
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.120]  they tried to regroup so some of it was playing possum and they'll do this again
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.960]  here but the fact is we just have a gangster criminal foreign banking
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:43.160]  oligarchy in control it's playing all our nations off against each other and
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.920]  one big reason everybody's turning against this two and a half year
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:55.400]  disgusting Syria's funded civil war using jihadis from Qatar Saudi Arabia and
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.600]  other areas is because my mother said this last night and I was already
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.960]  thinking it it was like a psychic moment almost I'm over at their house at
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.760]  night swimming around in their pool in their hot tub of my kids and my wife and
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:13.920]  my mother goes you know the reason people don't like this Syria thing it's
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.240]  something I've been thinking for days but hadn't said on air she goes was the
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:23.000]  same reason everybody got behind Israel in the 50s and 60s and 70s because you
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.920]  saw all these big nations ganged up on this little country attacking it and
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:35.200]  everybody rooted for the underdog I remember growing up rooting for Israel
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.040]  you know at church and all the rest of it and seeing all these countries gang up
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:45.560]  with superior military force and you know cheering Israel on as Israel
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:51.360]  defeated the people that were attacking them and again you can take sides either
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.600]  way now I'm sophisticated enough to not take any side because I get the
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:59.600]  globalist or above it playing the countries off against each other the
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:02.720]  Arabs you know say they want to kill all the Israelis and the Israelis say all
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:06.240]  let's go ahead and kill all the Arabs because it's tribal warfare I want to end
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.080]  that I want people to come together around a culture of liberty and freedom
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.400]  probably will never happen on the Middle East but it could happen in America
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:20.240]  that's why the globalist media is trying to divide and conquer us here because
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.680]  they don't want us to ever unify around a true culture of rediscovering what
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:29.640]  made the Western world the Magna Carta the Bill of Rights the Constitution the
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:32.600]  flower of the Renaissance the Enlightenment they don't want that to
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:38.560]  come back and so now it's safe to say the government runs al-Qaeda now people
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.480]  say false flag when no one knew what it was 10 years ago when I was using the
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:48.800]  term it shows how we have affected history you my listeners more than
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:53.880]  anybody spreading the word you are at the heart of this drudgereport.com
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.920]  pointing out the last few years that the West was funding al-Qaeda he would link
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.040]  to European newspapers that were covering it before American media
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:08.080]  covered it and Bilderberg two years ago from our sources had meetings about how
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.600]  upset they were that it was out that they ran the radical Muslims and it
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:15.760]  actually been stirring them up and funding them for almost a hundred years

[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:22.040]  I'm in a big deal about it about a three and a half weeks ago because it was a
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:27.840]  big deal they had about 200 top brass in the head PR flax and scyop officers
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:33.200]  civilian and military scyop officer psychological warfare at the Pentagon
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.320]  briefing with the undersecretary of defense admitting they're engaging in
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:42.760]  domestic scyops and saying the public doesn't believe us and the public is
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:47.960]  absolutely freaked out and they had officers get up and in teary-eyed you
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.280]  can see tears in their eyes say we don't want to lie people don't believe us
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:56.640]  anymore and they tried some of their scyops and things to roll out domestic
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:00.160]  scyops that now we're going to tell the truth because now we're going to have the
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.840]  CIA and Pentagon to operating domestically and everyone looked
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.720]  completely freaked out in the audience and we're shaking their heads and I
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.160]  happen to know why and I told you why because I know a lot of people in the
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:18.640]  military I'll just leave it at that they all know our government runs al-Qaeda
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:22.680]  they all know our government's foreign they tried to teach it at the army war
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:27.240]  college they had people like Thomas Barnett in the last decade give courses
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:31.360]  how our military now works for the new world order and globalism and they
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.480]  tried to hide it in plain view and the new army manuals came out in bad mouth
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:39.960]  George Washington and the founding fathers we showed that last week it was a
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:46.680]  big national news story that's not even a classified army manual all officers
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:53.560]  including non-commissioned sergeants and up folks are given that bad mouthing the
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:59.240]  founding fathers people think this is a joke then they're told no soldier George
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:05.040]  Washington is bad he wouldn't be welcome in our military they all know he was the
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:11.200]  first member of the US Army they all know that's treason these people jumped
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:18.040]  the shark they thought we would get behind al-Qaeda publicly publicly they
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:22.200]  tried to assassinate my character forever exposing that didn't work I didn't
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:27.600]  care because I said I was here to hit the barbed wire folks I was here to hit
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.080]  the barbed wire so it was safe for Ron Paul and safe for Pat Buchanan I told
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:36.320]  you this hundreds of times because I understand warfare ladies and gentlemen
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.720]  and I understand the truth is a weapon and I use it every day and I will go up
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:45.000]  against the dragon and ladies and gentlemen you need to go up against it
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.800]  as well and the minute you make the decision to reclaim your honor I don't
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.040]  care if you're in the military the government a private citizen whatever it
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.200]  is the minute you admit you haven't taken action against this and that you're
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:01.600]  gonna do something every day is the minute you're gonna start living the
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:05.240]  minute God's gonna start smiling at you and the minute we're gonna really turn
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:10.200]  this around because with a minority of us speaking out and taking action the
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:16.240]  globalist are in full-fledged panic and here's the scary news my gut tells me
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:22.040]  nerve gas attack bio attacker nuke in the Western world I'll guarantee it's
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:25.360]  being thought about right now by the globalist they didn't get in charge for
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:30.520]  for being shrinking violence shrinking violence they're bold and their
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:34.600]  fortunes evil and tyranny and fortune favors the bold and they know that so

[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:59.080]  through history every great leader has had to understand the potential of
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:04.840]  information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:10.600]  at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:15.400]  Hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:19.400]  ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:23.240]  between you observing and testing it out and verifying if they can take total
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:26.960]  control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:31.720]  of the game how to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would
[01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:41.200]  not only endorse but demand war because there's a war on for your mind get your
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:46.720]  copy of state of mind the movie at info wars dot com and remember every order at

[01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:00.520]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:20.000]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:29.160]  alex jones all right so ladies and gentlemen history is happening right
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:35.960]  now and the military is waking up in mass saying I will not fight for al-qaeda
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:39.200]  the globalists say oh we're gonna torture to see if we'll go along with
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:42.160]  that or oh we're gonna secretly arrest citizens to see if I go along with that
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:46.200]  and every time they get a public backlash they then back off and say we
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:50.680]  never said that they play mind games with us to make us feel powerless or
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:55.920]  now discovering that we do have power and now carry vows obama will violate
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:59.880]  constitution ahead of syria group meeting but again the big victory is
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:04.040]  they were going to attack they said they didn't need congressional approval now
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.800]  they're going to get it because they're afraid these criminals always get
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:14.360]  committees to agree large groups so not one person can be blamed for it they
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:19.640]  like to hedge their bets and confuse things with a bunch of legalese just
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:24.520]  like derivatives and credit default swaps it's the same thing with war they
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:28.760]  get a whole bunch of different organizations like NATO and the UN and
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:34.920]  and the EU and others to sign on every group to sign on except for the group
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:39.320]  that has the authority the american people's representatives the congress
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.600]  just as Obama said in his speech so he acts like he's gonna obey the forms
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.640]  while double-crossing it at the same time but it shows their incredible
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:54.160]  weakness this is a big deal now here's another Pat Buchanan clip with him on
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:02:04.440]  Newsmax just Friday what we should do here is first this thing weeks of a
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:10.520]  false-flag operation I would not understand or comprehend that a
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:17.480]  basher al-Assad no matter how bad a man he may be would be so stupid as to
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:22.440]  order a chemical weapons attack on civilians in his own country when the
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:26.880]  immediate consequence of which might be that he would be at war with the United
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:34.280]  States so this week of a false-flag operation all right now Ron Paul said
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:37.400]  the same thing Rand Paul came out and said we're on the side of al-Qaeda it
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:42.600]  looks like the rebels may have done this I have been here and I didn't even
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:46.480]  realize this 15 years ago or so but that's what what I've served the purpose
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:50.520]  of of moving the Overton window if you don't know what the Overton window is
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:56.280]  in psychology when they try to teach five-year-olds how to have brutal
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:01.560]  hardcore unhealthy sex if they can get you to accept that you'll accept
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:05.840]  anything so they take you a trillion miles even if you push it back a few
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.280]  billion you're still you know way down the road towards tyranny okay they try
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.440]  to normalize all their corruption they try to normalize saying your kids
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:18.680]  belong to the state and they're going to force inoculate you and homeschooling
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:23.800]  is illegal and then call you radical because you want basic freedom that's
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:27.160]  the same thing with this war making oh we're going to torture oh we're going to
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:31.640]  fund al-Qaeda oh we're going to do this word that but when people finally revolt
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:36.080]  against it it can boomerang back on them and their whole system can collapse
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.400]  because when you've ramped up an Overton window towards tyranny if people
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:45.560]  finally switch back the pendulum can swing so hard it flies out the other
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:50.800]  end of the building it can boomerang and so I've been here to move the Overton
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.720]  window back to common sense back to history and I don't care of a bunch of
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:04:00.040]  extremist and weirdos and kleptocratic control freaks get up on CNN Fox news
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:06.600]  MSNBC talk radio and say I'm the devil I'm a demon I'm a piece of trash I'm a
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:12.880]  liar I'm a scumbag just all sorts of I'm a racist I don't care because I am a
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:18.760]  soldier in the info war who's meant to blow a hole in their wall and by the way
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.680]  folks we haven't just blown a hole in their wall we've breached right through
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:27.800]  the main gate blown out dozens of giant holes we are now sieging the enemy
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:33.240]  emplacements in the citadel within the citadel the enemy is on fire now they
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:36.880]  may try to blow something up down the road to get us to run and fight that or
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:43.080]  whatever but the point is is that the New World Order is in disarray is in
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:48.840]  shambles and many other analysts are saying that crowdhammers saying it Dr.

[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:29.600]  is such a big news story we wanted to talk a little bit more about this sea

[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.440]  listing on 770 in Ohio and so many others that are holding and then we're
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:44.400]  gonna get at the bottom of the hour to the very informative report that you
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:53.120]  guys have put together dealing with the protest against the war that happened
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:09:00.840]  here happened here this weekend but the main issue that I wanted to talk about
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:08.640]  here again for some stations that some stations that just joined us is that
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.560]  folks know that I don't get on air people see this time and time again I
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:17.560]  really tell you what I believe is happening in the world and I don't ever
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:23.400]  lie to myself about the analysis that I and others that I respect have come up
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:29.720]  with and to understand that just with human intelligence what I've seen on
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.520]  the street about half the military or listeners and they listen about every
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:36.960]  week or so I've done informal surveys on the street and then and now we see that
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:43.280]  coming out of the Pentagon and I'm just one node in this overall fight you're
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:48.160]  just one little one little node in this overall fight it is just so
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:53.840]  incredibly historical to now see it be mainstream kitchen table talk why is our
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:57.480]  government run al-qaeda why does our government stage false flags and the
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.240]  videos come out and they have world net daily join us and drugs join us it's not
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:06.120]  just in full wars and to have Rand Paul and Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan and to
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:11.720]  have the general public get it and to be I went to a bowling alley with my son
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:17.840]  yesterday and some friends and I was given three bowling games and shoes
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:23.840]  everyone was listeners never been there before until this week people came over
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:28.480]  from both sides where we're bowling were listeners I ran into the off-duty cop
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:33.360]  that was their security he was a listener I went up to get some drinks at
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:39.000]  the bar the bartenders were listeners and again I'm not sitting here bragging
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.520]  oh I'm a big deal people know who I am no no no it wouldn't matter if it was they
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.680]  knew who I was because I was some rapper or I was some basketball player I was
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:52.320]  some football player I was some you know reality TV star these are people that
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:55.360]  are listeners that are like can you believe they're running al-qaeda it was
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.280]  the things they were saying and it's almost like fight club because a lot of
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.320]  times they'll just be like like I mean it's really if this is good again this
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:07.440]  has got a I want the people out there to know David that the awakening is on and
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.760]  now for the first time in a hundred years they can't launch a false flag and
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:17.960]  get away with it and this is Soviet Union pre-Soviet Union collapse Romania
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:22.400]  Chilchescu collapse level stuff what do you say to that well just like Ed from
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:26.640]  New York was saying when I took him one of the callers we had last hour he said
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:29.640]  he found you with the Pierce Morgan thing and it's the Pierce Morgan thing
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:35.800]  it's the the Boston bombing that happened when that happened and and Dan
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.360]  Bonondi bless him he got up there and they were trying to do everything to
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.960]  intimidate him to ridicule him but he got the message out about false flags and
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:48.280]  you saw the media running reports about oh what is a false flag and I mean it was
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.520]  a brand-new term it was the biggest story exactly for a couple days well that
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:56.480]  and that's what this show there he got it on there and people understood and then
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.280]  what a false flag is and so and it becomes such a pervasive thing that now
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:04.480]  you've got people feel like you said you hit the you hit the bar bar first and so
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:07.840]  now it's it's something that people can talk about they understand that it's
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:11.320]  there and very few people pushed back on it we just had a salon article where
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:14.520]  they pushed back on it said according to false flag lore there was the Reich
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:19.720]  Togfire and it's like according to lore you don't know anything about history you
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:23.640]  don't know about the Reich Togfire Tomkin and that is exactly operation Ajax
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.920]  but I mean the Northwoods fire is like the archetype but there's been so many
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:31.600]  and we've documented it you know Operation Gladio all these different things
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:34.960]  and people are understanding that now it caused a discussion back with the
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:38.720]  Boston bombing and we see that it's the same kind of template they have this
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:41.960]  MO that they use over and over again when they do a domestic false flag they've
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:45.000]  got another MO that they use when they want to invade a country like we saw
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.640]  with the Iraq war about weapons of mass destruction now we see again with the
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:54.880]  Syrian war absolutely and and so I'm not up here saying hey our shows big I'm
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:58.560]  explaining this for people out there that aren't well known who feel like
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:03.000]  they're all alone I can't go anywhere now was the hiking bike trail this morning
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.600]  when my dad ran into multiple listeners out of just 20 people we passed I just
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:11.240]  want to give people the good news is that America and the world is awakening
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:17.560]  Dempsey tells them the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman don't attack Obama comes
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:22.160]  out and lies Friday or Saturday and says you know the chairman supports me
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:27.360]  thinks this is a good idea the fact is is that once the confidence is lost in
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.800]  the confidence man once people finally understand it's like that in-scene and
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:37.360]  facing the crowd that's got Andy Griffith in it or whatever where where he
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.280]  gets caught admitting he's a con artist then the whole thing basically implodes
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:46.600]  and look at all the Twitter being flooded and people can retweet it real
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  Alex Jones these thousands of photos of military officers but also enlisted
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.760]  holding up signs saying I will not fight on the side of Al Qaeda in Syria but
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:01.080]  what do you make of my point and then I'll get out here and go to calls that
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:06.800]  it's the ganging up to people instinctively get that that the whole
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:11.440]  world is the whole Western world is ganging up on little Syria and I think
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:15.640]  it's the same thing that endeared people to Israel even though Israel wasn't
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:19.040]  perfect you know no country is is that the image of a little country being
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:22.800]  ganged up on we all instinctively don't like that good people don't like that
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:26.600]  that's right and what you said about people kind of pushback the overton
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:32.400]  window you've got a Bush administration person who was on that MSNBC clip they
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.240]  played earlier her name is Everett and she was saying this is exactly what we
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:42.400]  saw and she talks at great length to the people at MSNBC passionately about how
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:45.360]  we were lied to how they twisted the narrative and saying they're doing
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.520]  exactly the same thing people understand that they were lied to about that they
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:53.480]  understand that it's a template that the administration is using they see that
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.720]  same template being used again it's like come on I'm not falling for that
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.360]  well that's it and that's why I say it's jumping the shark yeah it's jumping the
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:06.320]  shark to do this over and over again and then their own jihadis are so badly
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:11.760]  coordinated they upload videos that day of them shooting off the mortars I mean
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.640]  that's what's insane about this is is they don't even try to hide it anymore
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:19.920]  and then and then Obama says I don't need Congress's authority then he goes
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:24.280]  okay I do but then Kerry doubles back and says but we really don't and again
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:28.360]  they may end up being able to get their Syria attack I think right now they
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:32.320]  won't I even thought last week that they might but if they did it would be the
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:36.120]  beginning of the end for them and I think even more intelligent members the
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:40.520]  establishment who aren't even good people realize this is reckless and the
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:45.440]  Russians are involved the Chinese are involved and I'm not I'm not romanticizing
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:50.360]  them but it's been said so many times that national sovereignty is a firewall
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:56.080]  and just as just as there were a lot of nations that could oppose Hitler what
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:58.920]  have we already had a UN and Hitler could have got control of that there
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:02.400]  would have been no opposing a global government run by Hitler and these
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:06.160]  eugenicists basically created Hitler they didn't they didn't run him they
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.600]  created him like Frankenstein and let him out in the in the countryside
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:13.440]  pun intended because Frankenstein's German folks and that's what happened and
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:18.440]  now they've created or helped reanimate the al-Qaeda Frankenstein that's what
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:21.960]  they're and then they pose as the saviors as Frankenstein runs around the
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:27.960]  the village in the countryside killing people and we're tired of this and we
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:32.160]  don't like losing our liberties our birthright in the name of al-Qaeda while
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.000]  criminal elements the government run it and I'm telling you there's a thousand
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.440]  points is why get so frustrated when I'm laying there in bed at night or sitting
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.720]  there thinking or writing notes of why this is so big but anybody out there
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:47.760]  who's followed this you know all those points as well this news is so
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:52.320]  incredibly good that I feel like I just want a billion-dollar lottery well it's
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.920]  what is the big new presence case that last week he said there's a global
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:57.960]  awakening and then and it is there's another one of the data points in my
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:01.480]  notes exactly talk about you got you got well look at turkey for example okay
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:05.840]  turkey last week their parliament voted down the idea that they were going to
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:10.640]  play host to 60,000 American troops don't talk about this just being a
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:15.680]  surgical strike that's not what's this is boots on the ground absolutely even
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.120]  today when the Obama administration met with some of these congressmen who
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:23.840]  happen to be in town they're coming back and saying well this is really broad
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.800]  this is gonna have to be narrowed down this really isn't just a surgical
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:30.560]  missile strike this is a very broad authorization so they they already
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:34.240]  turkey's not saying oh we'd like 60,000 American troops here on their own
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:37.440]  they're already being told that by the US government that's what they'd like to
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:41.320]  prove exactly I just realized that's a huge article that you just mentioned that
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:44.960]  was buried in the news today with the turkey saying you know they want more
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.080]  in Reuters and the New York Times but the headline should be Obama caught
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:53.360]  lying plans boots on the ground right because because there's the proof but
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:57.560]  it's part of it being a global awakening the Turkish Parliament voted it down
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:02.520]  exactly okay the British Parliament for the first time since 1782 that's right
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:06.120]  exact now the French want to vote that's right and so the question is the
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:10.400]  article that's up on info wars right now is can I think is Paul Craig Roberts
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:15.720]  wrote it can Obama buy off the Congress and the military industrial complex that
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.840]  Obama represents the corporates that he represents can he buy off Congress and
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:23.400]  get his war authorization or blackmail him with all the NSA stuff exactly
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:27.840]  exactly so that's the key people need to get active they need to hold their feet
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.720]  to the fire they need to awaken their neighbors they really need to create a
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:34.760]  firestorm and see right there's why I was so frustrated and said I got to come
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.840]  back in on air even though I'm a pretty working Obama deception today you're
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.280]  doing a great job as I'm like I didn't make all the points and the yeah
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:44.120]  Brzezinski says the alternative media is destroying us all hands on deck
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:48.640]  they're exposing our false flags all these parliaments are voting it down
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:52.560]  it's incredible what's happening it really is a global awakening and this
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:57.800]  is Brzezinski said this Brzezinski the guy who was the founder of the Trilateral
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:02.320]  Commission and you know the guy he's Obama's advisor on this yeah it created
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:05.920]  al-Qaeda in the first place okay he knows how this game is played and he's
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:09.240]  saying this game is not working anymore they've got to come up with some kind of
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:14.200]  a new way to Jimmy this and again the question is are these Republicans
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:19.120]  gonna fall in line because they just knee-jerk reflexively support military
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.520]  I agree I know you're going to break them back with calls you got that report
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:24.360]  coming up great job David I'm gonna go work on Obama deception to up here on
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:27.760]  the holiday God bless everybody out there I just want to throw in here at
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:32.160]  the end that my point is we may be able to stop this they may do a false flag
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:38.120]  we may not be able to stop it but look at how the game's slowing down we're
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:41.800]  winning more and more points we're getting the momentum the awakenings
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:46.080]  there if they go ahead with this in front of everybody it'll only blow up in
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:49.800]  their face bigger down the road that's what I'm saying David I've looked at the
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:54.800]  angles we win no matter what they do it's just gonna get really nasty so if the
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:59.000]  awakening explodes even faster we may be able to back them off and have a total
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:02.600]  collapse God bless you we'll be right back after 22 years of nutritional

[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.880]  I'm David Knight and I'm gonna be finishing out the show today as Alex
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:35.720]  works on the documentary The Obama Deception 2 and as that song said we
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:40.320]  are men of constant sorrow because we've got to constantly watch our
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:44.040]  government watch what they're doing one of the things we didn't mention in the
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:48.760]  last segment I started talking about the home school situation these are
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:53.520]  authoritarians who are here look at the way they acted with these this home
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:57.480]  schooling family that escaped from Germany it's now our Attorney General who's
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:25:01.680]  saying no they don't deserve any asylum they don't deserve the freedom of
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:04.760]  religion they don't deserve the freedom of speech they don't deserve to home
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.360]  school they need to be sent back to Germany where their kids can be taken
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:12.200]  away this is their attitude this is what's going to come out here at home
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:16.560]  and it's also very frightening I find that it's the same representatives the
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:21.800]  Peter Kings the Mike Rogers the John Kerry's the Obamas who are always always
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:26.280]  in favor of indefinite detention of spying unconstitutionally on
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:31.400]  everything that we all of our communications and also supporting
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:36.680]  killing people without due process abroad using drones always supporting the
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:41.200]  cause of war understand that these are authoritarians regardless of the party
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:44.040]  that they're in whether they call themselves Democrats or Republicans
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:49.720]  this is the war party and the war party is also the anti-civil liberty the
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:54.960]  anti-bill of rights party there needs to be a realignment this this division
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:00.400]  between Democrats and Republicans is phony absolutely phony it needs to be
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:04.720]  between the authoritarians like Mike Rogers and Peter King and Obama it
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.680]  needs to be between the authoritarians and the libertarians like Justin Amash
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:13.840]  Rand Paul Ted Cruz this is going to be the fundamental alignment this is where
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:18.000]  we need to focus we need to look beyond this we need to look at Democrats like
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.640]  Kucinich who said why are we doing this we're going to be the Air Force for
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:26.520]  Al Qaeda there are good people on both the Democrats and the Republicans side
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.480]  and they're bad people on both sides and we need to be able to sort them out as
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:34.720]  to where they fall on civil liberties where they fall on war this is a life
[02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:39.280]  and liberty issue those things need to come first but it's also about fiscal
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:43.480]  issues we cannot afford to do this even for the hardcore Republicans who want
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:48.120]  to reflexively fall in line between any war always support they think the
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:51.360]  military industrial complex they need to start supporting our troops they need
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:54.720]  to understand that our troops are put in danger they need to stop having our
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:57.640]  troops using depleted uranium you want to talk about weapons of mass
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:02.440]  destruction let's talk about the long-term permanent effects of depleted
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:05.920]  uranium wherever it's used let's talk about the long-term effects of depleted
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:11.200]  uranium on our soldiers what if we had sarin gas what if what if the sarin gas
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:16.280]  that the Syrian soldiers were using caused cancer increase and the people
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.360]  who were using it the soldiers who were using it what if it caused birth defects
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:24.240]  for their children what if it lingered in the area for thousands of years tens
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:28.640]  of thousands of years sarin gas as horrible as it is doesn't do that our
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:33.320]  weapons do our depleted uranium does and it was the same time that they tried to
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.440]  take the moral high ground say we're not going to use sarin gas anymore that they
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:42.320]  went in and they started using depleted uranium now earlier we had a clip of some
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:46.960]  people who were doing protests over the weekend protesting the war they had
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:51.000]  info war shirts on they had been swan signs on these are people who have been
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.240]  woken up by info wars arrest the alternative media and they were getting
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:58.620]  hassled by the police saying they didn't have permit to demonstrate and they
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:01.600]  said well our permit is actually the Constitution and they stood them off and
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:06.760]  the police in that particular case stood down we also had that happening here in
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:12.600]  Austin we had a demonstration we didn't have a stand stand down situation but we
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:16.920]  had our reporters go out and judge jacari Jackson went and recorded it this this
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:19.920]  last weekend on Saturday and we've got a report of that right now let's roll that
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:36.840]  report guys my name is Ben Kessler I was in the Marine Corps from 2002 to 2006
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:42.320]  I was infantry served in Afghanistan in 2004 I'm out here today because I don't
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:46.800]  want to see us starting a war in Syria I'm Dr. Laura Presley and I'm out here
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:51.240]  for the rally against the war in Syria that President Obama has been proposing
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:58.120]  proper action for us to take is to help in a diplomatic process I mean there's a
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:03.040]  lot of different options that don't involve bombing or sending troops to
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:07.560]  Syria and all of those options are better than the military options this
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:13.120]  president needs to remember that he was awarded the peace prize his first term
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:19.920]  and that war is not peace and yesterday I called Cornyn's office senator Ted
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:23.840]  Cruz's office and representative congressman Mike McCall's office and
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:28.840]  said they need to be taking a leadership role here in the state of Texas and hold
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:33.160]  President Obama accountable for this that's right you need to get involved
[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:36.560]  you need to put pressure on your congressman they need to hear from you

[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:43.840]  season but it's not to say that we won't have some and you want to be prepared in
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:48.400]  case that happens we have very short lines of supply in America you know it's

[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:56.920]  are it's a very efficient thing for the companies that do it but it also means
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:00.360]  that our supply lines are very very short if there's something like a
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:05.680]  hurricane or there's something like a war or a false flag attack or a terrorist
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:11.480]  attack you're not going to have very much food and the chain of supply so you

[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:37.800]  we're going to go back and we're going to talk to callers who've been waiting
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:41.080]  quite a long time but I've alluded to this a couple of times and have it
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:46.000]  really explained it this is a breaking story today there actually came out
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.080]  yesterday I should say from the New York Times talking about how the DEA is
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:55.240]  using phone records and spying on people listen to this for the last six
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:58.240]  years law enforcement officials working on counter narcotics programs have had
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:02.280]  routine access using subpoenas to an enormous AT&T database that contains
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:06.480]  the records of decades decades of Americans phone calls it's called the
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:11.880]  hemisphere project now this only involves records from AT&T but AT&T has
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:19.680]  records that go back to 1987 26 years worth of data that's dwarfed by what the
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:25.560]  NSA claims that they're holding only five years worth of data and this includes
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.520]  every call this isn't just AT&T customers this is every call that passes
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:36.000]  through an AT&T switch going back for 26 years and the thing I find interesting
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.080]  about this is that as always the government likes to try to wiggle
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:43.400]  around all this by saying well this is something that the third party is
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:48.520]  supplying to us so we don't have to get a judge to give us authorization to take
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:53.280]  a look at this they say that well this this information is being stored by
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:57.640]  AT&T and not by the government therefore it's not a problem right no it is a
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.200]  problem but that's what they're using with CISPA and these other programs to
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:09.440]  try to get around it they're saying well if Facebook or Google or someone else
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:14.040]  has your emails or has your data that third party can voluntarily turn it
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:16.720]  over to the government well of course they're going to voluntarily turn it
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:19.840]  over because the government gives them a lot of money and also holds a gun to
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:23.240]  their head to try to do you know try to force them into doing it so they get
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:27.240]  both a carrot and a stick and then they say we don't need to go before a judge
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:31.160]  and get a search warrant because we're just asking this third party who's
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:35.440]  holding this data and they're voluntarily turning it over to us I hope
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:39.560]  some lawmakers who have a conscience are listening to this because that's where
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:42.480]  the law needs to be changed needs to be clear that the government doesn't get
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:48.200]  any information on us even from third parties unless they have a judge's
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.360]  search warrant now let's go to some of the callers who we've had Lauren in
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:56.040]  Ohio waiting for quite a while Lauren what do you think about this so what
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:03.800]  what do you think is the least untruthful scenario for Syria well I I kind
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:07.040]  of come at it a different way I think that they just got caught pulling the
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:11.160]  app so because why would that guy you know the one who said oh my son was
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:17.920]  involved and they just didn't handle them right I mean it just I think they
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:21.240]  did it they got caught because everybody is looking for them to do it and so now
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:24.640]  they want somebody else to take the blame for it but in the end we have to
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:28.320]  kind of change the way I've got solutions and then I've got some kind of funny
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:32.120]  things because I was I kind of was taking notes while you were talking hey
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:39.080]  so let's start saying all CIA you know what I mean right I'll see a public
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:45.400]  things that they catch on you know what I mean right all CIA I mean come on
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:51.920]  everybody should know this and the other one is QE for ever 80 billion dollars a
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:55.200]  month and we don't have a problem that's right we have an arms over this
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:58.880]  because we've all been in public schools and they of course are run by the
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:03.560]  globalists that lie to you so since we're made up of lies and wed to lies
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:07.720]  then lies is what we get but well they keep bringing up these different things
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:13.280]  to you know it's almost I've had so many different scandals it's almost like
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:15.960]  they're bringing up another scandal so that they take our mind off of the
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:18.600]  previous one we don't pay attention it's like you know don't look at that look
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:22.120]  at this next thing and this whole thing in Syria is a way to get people's minds
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:26.480]  off of government spying and violation of the Fourth Amendment the IRS
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:30.000]  targeting particular people vice continues to go on and nothing has been
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.760]  done about that nothing's been done about fast and furious none of these
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:36.360]  scandals have been addressed they've just shoved them under the rug moved on
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:41.720]  to the next thing right but that's the whole thing about we what we have to do
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:47.040]  is shatter the illusion that somehow or another government which is mind control
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:52.520]  control men the Constitution shows you exactly what the government for it is a
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:57.480]  body of negative law to limit the maids in the butler it has nothing to say
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:02.600]  about what we free kings in this country can do and you can tell as you look at
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:08.360]  the document the large C the capital C changes to a lowercase C these things
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:13.520]  mean things but anyway oh absolutely solution we need to obey God if we did
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:18.040]  things his way like all these soldiers standing up and saying I'm not going to
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:23.280]  fight along all CIA duh because they are unwilling to do that which is
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:28.080]  corrupt and destructive well you need the globalist don't have any control you
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:31.160]  need to get a lot of people you need to convince a lot of Christians about the
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:35.520]  proper understanding of Romans 13 it isn't just doing whatever the government
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:39.480]  tells you to do it's when the government gets out of line of moral
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:42.480]  authority when the government gets out of line of its legitimate legal
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:46.920]  authority they swear to uphold the Constitution and when they ignore the
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:51.240]  Constitution which is the rightful king they are out of they no longer have any
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:54.640]  legitimate authority that's why I'm calling them not the Obama administration
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:58.160]  because they're not administering the government they're not administering the
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:02.080]  Constitution they're not following their oath of office they're nothing but a
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:06.040]  regime you understand how they they use these words everybody their enemies are
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:08.640]  always regimes but they're an administration they're not an
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:11.480]  administration they're done have any legitimate authority because they've
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.400]  denied the Constitution well thanks thanks and one more thing I just for
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:19.360]  control so that because we don't have to all get together in some group keep your
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:22.600]  money in your pocket stop paying taxes you don't know and keep your children in
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:27.280]  your home teach them the truth or pay somebody private teacher whatever get
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:30.480]  together with the neighbors on the block but when we put our kids in these
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:35.600]  institutions where they lie to them and then pump yeah generation what can we
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:39.120]  expect but that they don't understand the Constitution what can we expect it
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:43.200]  they're not exposed to 10 little commandments like don't steal and kill
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.720]  people that never did anything to you and don't covet what they have especially
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:53.120]  when we're sitting on the wealth of what we're sitting on absolutely you know
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:56.880]  Lauren so that's the sea change that's happening in society that you guys were
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:00.040]  talking about earlier I couldn't agree with you more you know they've had a
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:05.120]  judge say we had a situation in Massachusetts where a fellow was not
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:09.320]  happy with what his children were being taught in school and he wanted to come in
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:12.200]  and see what was going on there and they said no you can't come in you can't
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:15.840]  know what they're teaching these little kids in terms of sex education they had
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:21.040]  him arrested and he took the case to court and the judges said you have when
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:24.600]  you take your children to the government school you have abandoned your child to
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:27.680]  the state that's what they said I'm that's not my words that's their words
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:30.440]  that's a quote from them you have abandoned your children to the state
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:34.720]  the official term the legal term for that is in local parenis they're going to
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:39.920]  act in place of the parents they that's the way they see this they see it as
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:43.520]  they have now control over your children and they are going to instill the kind
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:48.000]  of values that they want we've got a report here that I think is really
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.840]  interesting you know we've been talking about this for quite some time we saw
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:55.720]  this was going to happen here at info wars and here's report going back to
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:00.080]  May 31st this is Darren McBreen hosting the info wars nightly news and here's
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:04.680]  what he had to say back on May 31st about this very issue in Syria that
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:11.280]  we see today and to make matters worse Al Qaeda mercenaries in Syria or should I
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:16.960]  say Al CIA to mercenaries well they've been caught with sarin gas this
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:23.040]  according to Turkish Turkish officials this is concrete evidence that CIA
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:28.640]  mercenaries operating in Syria under the leadership of the Al Nazra front well
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:33.640]  it's a terrorist group aligned with Al Qaeda they are in possession of deadly
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:40.360]  sarin gas they plan to use it against the Syrian army but you watch in typical
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:47.120]  NATO US false flag fashion the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:54.120]  of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels and Obama will finally
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:43:00.560]  have his excuse to intervene militarily there you go there is a good chance that
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:05.600]  was back May 31st the nightly news broadcast so get a subscription to
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:09.640]  prison planet TV it helps to support our operation it helps to educate people
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:16.080]  and that's what's really necessary is for people to understand what their
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.160]  techniques are what their MO's are we were pointing that out back in May and
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:26.360]  of course the UN inspectors they'd had a an attack and back in May in Syria and
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:30.360]  they said it was the rebels and it was sarin gas but it was the rebels who did
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.120]  it the rebels who were trying to draw it give not draw in but they were trying to
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:37.920]  give Obama an excuse to intervene there let's go to someone else who's been
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:47.480]  waiting for quite a while Kyle in Texas Kyle what do you think about this caught
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:49.960]  you by surprise I know you've been waiting a long time and then finally we
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:44:08.640]  come to you are you there what I have to say about this is that with Syria and everything and I listened to Alex Jones and you guys done a perfect job on everything thank you perfect job I'm
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:17.640]  congratulations perfect job and it's probably probably what it did when you
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.160]  described everything it describes everything that I wrote like two or three
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:29.320]  years ago so yeah it's a very repeating pattern is familiar it's not like we've
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:32.560]  got some crystal ball it's not like we're speculating it's not like we're
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:36.080]  offering conspiracy theories all we're doing is telling people look this is
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:39.480]  what they did last time this is what they did two times ago this is what
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:43.120]  they're doing now they don't even change their strategy that even change the
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:46.840]  narrative they just use the same techniques over and over again and we're
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:50.960]  trying to educate people and it looks like it's taking we've got 90% of the
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:55.040]  people now opposing it as opposed to 75% of the people who supported it when we
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.280]  were told the same lies by the Bush administration anything else you want to
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:05.680]  that Kyle yes when you said the Bush administration that it goes with the Iraq
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:12.120]  war when they said there's WMD and I was like what I'm 21 right now I was probably
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:19.280]  felt like maybe 11 or 12 during that time when the WMD was going through Iraq
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:26.640]  and everything like that and I told my mother like mom this this thing is not
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:33.520]  true you there's no WMD and she's like no dad go go play your video game and
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:39.920]  told some of my friends about it and they're like they follow me as the
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:43.040]  lead yeah and you know it wasn't the first time when they did it in the Bush
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:46.520]  administration the previous Bush administration had essentially come up
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:50.680]  with a false narrative to justify the very first Iraq war they had the woman
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:53.800]  who was then saying that she'd seen the babies and the incubators and it turns
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:56.800]  out she was an ambassador's daughter hadn't even been there so they keep
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:01.040]  using the same type of thing over and over again saying we're gonna go kill
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:05.720]  people for humanitarian reasons and they base it all on the lie and this time
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:10.840]  it's the least detailed story I mean they're even getting tired of their
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:14.280]  narratives thanks Kyle we're gonna go next to because we've got several people
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:18.680]  who have been waiting a long time we're gonna go to Phil in Florida Phil what
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:23.400]  do you think about this hi David thanks for taking the show and thanks for
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:28.480]  taking my call I hope I can get out what I have to say before you have to cut in
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:34.440]  I'm a coordinator of the Central Florida chapter of veterans for peace Dr. Bob
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:40.480]  Bowman's home chapter who we buried this week yes and I need to tell you all that
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:48.040]  that our organization veterans for peace at the national level voted to impeach
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:53.880]  President Obama for the very same war crimes we cited in our call for impeaching
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:47:00.440]  Bush yes and and and there's an article on activist post in which I hope info
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:05.720]  wars and prison planet will pick up it's called timeline for veterans for
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:13.960]  pieces vote to impeach Obama 2009 through 2013 and the impeachment the
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:19.200]  claim that the left anti-war movement makes is if it didn't happen for Bush it
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:24.240]  wouldn't have it won't happen for Obama but what people don't realize that the
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:30.200]  only time impeachment has been enough of a threat to change behavior of the
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:35.440]  administration is only when it's been a partisan call and we're not talking
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:39.160]  about whether it'll happen or not we're talking about who's making the call and
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:44.800]  it was exciting news that Alex and y'all broke a week or two ago about the
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:50.680]  overpass calls for impeachment yes that's coming from the right David and and we
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:56.040]  need to get the word out there's been a suppression of this from the leadership
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:01.920]  of the national anti-war organizations because well like any organization you
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:08.160]  know they they they they're beholden to others I can tell you this Phil that if
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:11.680]  he goes if he goes before Congress now and tries to get an authorization and
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:15.640]  if they don't give him this authorization and if he attacks as the
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:19.360]  State Department told Fox News that he's going to attack anyway whether he gets
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:22.680]  authorization or not he will be impeached in my opinion I think the
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:26.400]  people are angry enough about this on both the left and the right you have not
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:29.240]  the leadership of the Democrat Party and not even the leadership of the
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:33.760]  Republican Party were opposing him on the declaration of war it was the lower
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:38.480]  level people for the most part in both parties that were saying we need to get
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:42.000]  Congress involved on this the right way to do this is to talk to Congress the
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:47.280]  Constitution gives Congress the power to decide this not the president so it's
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.440]  coming from others in in the Congress other than the leadership and I think
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:54.600]  that it's people from both parties they're going to push back pretty hard
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:58.800]  and the American people are going to be outraged extremely angry this is the
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:04.520]  most unpopular war we've ever had proposed war we've ever had and it and we
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:11.000]  have to talk about Walter Jones and you all had him on a year ago he has a
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:16.480]  resolution that the left anti-war people don't want their rank and file to
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:22.560]  know about and that's the threat of impeachment should Obama do this and
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:26.680]  and you're not hearing the anti-war people that you know that this partisan
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:32.200]  crap and dr. Bob Bowman did a great interview with Alex in studio in July
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:37.480]  of 09 and and that it's on your Alex Jones YouTube channel it's called the
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:41.640]  American people are artificially divided and you alluded to that earlier
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:48.280]  David but please we've got to get your congressmen to get behind HCR 3 which
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:52.880]  threatens impeachment because this is all good that the shift in the tide that
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:56.800]  you were talking about is all well and good but it ain't enough that's right
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:02.240]  gotta be some kind of threat real threat from the people to stop this guy
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:07.040]  already demonstrated he with Libya that he doesn't care if he has Congress or
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:11.920]  not we've had Walter Jones on we've had Walter Jones on talking about that I'm
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:15.760]  sure he's gonna be on shortly talking about that again so need to really hold
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:19.080]  their feet to the fire on this and we need to understand as I said before
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:23.360]  there has to be a realignment we have to understand that it's the same people who
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:28.200]  are trashing the Bill of Rights who are saying there is no due process there is
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:32.960]  no privacy anymore and we have a right to go to war without talking to Congress
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:38.320]  in every aspect it's the same people who are opposing our civil rights who are
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:43.400]  also wanting to start a war and they will bring that to America they will use
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:46.920]  that war machine here domestically they've already brought back a lot of
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:50.640]  equipment they're purchasing bullets they're gearing up for a domestic war
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:54.320]  and they have the lack of moral authority to do it right here we're gonna
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:59.160]  take some more calls will be right back after the break stay tuned

[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:10.680]  the GCN radio network
[02:54:12.840 --> 02:54:17.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show and of course we've been talking all day
[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:23.800]  about the changes that happened this weekend we saw Obama blink and back down
[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:27.880]  we all expected him to launch a quote-unquote surgical strike of course we
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:32.000]  know what that means there's nothing at all surgical about launching missiles
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.480]  into a country but we saw him back down from that action we saw him say he
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:40.480]  still asserted that he had the authority to do that even though there's
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:44.120]  nothing about that in the Constitution about him acting unilaterally when
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:47.760]  there is no imminent danger to the United States when the United States is not
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:51.240]  under attack he does not have the authority to do that but he asserted
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:54.840]  that he did but he was going to be magnanimous and go before Congress and
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:59.760]  now we see that congressmen who have looked at what he wants are saying
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:05.240]  ooh this is really broad this is not just a surgical strike and of course it
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:10.080]  isn't they prepositioned a lot of ships a lot of planes a lot of men and
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.880]  material they were going to Turkey to get us authorization for 60,000 American
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:20.640]  troops to be stationed in Turkey they're looking for a broader war they're not
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.160]  tired of war but we are tired of their lies and the American people are pushing
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:29.160]  back but it's not just the American people there is a global awakening and
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:33.680]  that's coming from the big new Brzezinski who use that exact phrase you see
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:38.080]  even in Turkey they said they didn't want the US troops you see that Britain
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:42.400]  for the first time in 200 years turned down the Prime Minister's calls for an
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:47.880]  authorization for an attack for war and you see that there's only 9% of the
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.560]  people are buying what Obama is selling here so we've got a couple of callers
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:54.000]  who've been waiting on their phone for a long time and I want to know what they
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:59.280]  think about this because now is a time for you to continue to press this point
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:03.760]  the American people have woken up even the sheeple are not with Obama so it's
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:07.560]  time for those of us who know what's going on who've seen this pattern happen
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:12.440]  over and over again it's time for us to get involved and to stop the killing to
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:18.400]  stop the bleeding of blood and of treasury and to this never-ending war
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:23.200]  machine called the military industrial complex we got Mark in California and
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:26.880]  then coming up we've got Frank in North Carolina Mark are you there what do you
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:33.280]  think about this yeah yesterday I was finishing up with a sermon in John 5
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:38.720]  36 there's a street preaching in burleague in California and I walked up to
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:42.600]  ten of the officers here across the street chatting and watching over us all
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:47.560]  and I mentioned hey you ought to check out this info wars calm guy he interviewed
[02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:52.360]  a bunch of cops there in Oklahoma City about the federal building back in
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:55.920]  April 19th and they said they'd all tune in so like to say hi to all the
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:01.360]  officers there if they did and you many should follow the shining example of
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:06.720]  this listeners he has a info wars calm and radio Liberty bumper sticker that
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:11.480]  always helps people out of curiosity tune in because of that mm-hmm yeah but
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:15.560]  you know for reasons of national security I was driving down Lovenworth
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:19.320]  Street there in San Francisco trying to keep an eye on the former head of the
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:25.200]  national security agency leader the so-called great Michael Aquino do you
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:30.360]  know anything about Michael Aquino oh yeah I do yeah it's a yeah yeah church of
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:34.000]  was it church of Satan yeah church of Satan that he had going on there and
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:38.760]  there was quite a bit of a child abuse scandal that happened there around the
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:44.360]  Presidio right yeah he's the worst child murderer in all of history and and
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:49.120]  highly connected in the NSA the NSA got him out of that the the military moved
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:53.560]  him out of that area even though a chaplain's four-year-old child said you
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:58.160]  know pointed him out and even described that he had a room that had all black
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:03.320]  walls even though all of that happened basically the army the NSA bailed him
[02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:07.400]  out of all of that yeah what's up with that the Lamb of God is watching you
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:12.080]  Michael he's going to get you but anyway the fact of the matter is David is
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:16.880]  there's coming a day of judgment and Jesus is writing all this stuff down and
[02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:20.600]  when some belief and I don't know his name or I'd use it on the air from the
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:25.840]  FBI told the chief of police get this David the chief of police and we're

[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:41.880]  interview with Doug Malar he's very he's been he passed out a bunch of leaflets
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:45.440]  around Leavenworth you know Michael Aquino's house there in San Francisco
[03:00:45.440 --> 03:00:51.280]  warning the neighbors you know that this guy is a very very bad guy Doug Malar
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:55.560]  I don't know if you know Ted Gunderson but Ted Gunderson a great guy in the FBI
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:59.720]  he's passed away probably was poisoned by Michael Aquino's buds because he died
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:06.480]  of arsenic poisoning he said that Doug Malar was the number one authority
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:12.440]  exposing Michael Aquino and it's it's amazing how audacious this devil
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:18.900]  worshiping murderous file is and gonna get you Michael but he went up and he
[03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:24.200]  tried to get a restraining order against Doug Malar and Peter Chernoff for
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:33.200]  exposing him and the the judge in San Francisco had the audacity as Peter was
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:37.800]  allegedly molested by Michael Aquino and he read these facts the judge
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:42.440]  threatened Peter Chernoff that he might go to jail if he didn't stop reading it
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:47.360]  and Peter Chernoff said I realized fully that I could go to jail it was sitting
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:51.720]  there with Michael Aquino Doug Malar and himself and then the judge you know what
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:55.720]  he did did he bring him into a back room to find out if Peter Chernoff was lying
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:02:00.720]  about Michael Aquino or not no he walked out of the room yeah walked out of the
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:05.160]  room David it's a long-standing situation we've reported on here over and
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:09.360]  over again you see it the pattern being repeated everywhere as Jimmy Seville and
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:15.200]  the UK you see US ambassadors that are involved in child prostitution rings you
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:20.640]  see things happening in CPS all over the country it's a very disturbing pattern
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:25.720]  but as you pointed out there's a very dark satanic side to this we also see as
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:32.120]  Alex when he went to Bohemian Grove it was a pretty eye-opening episode for a
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:38.120]  lot of people all over the world to see how the leaders of the West would get
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:42.240]  together and and act something that looked like it was out of some Indiana
[03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:46.320]  Jones and Temple of Doom movie I mean it was bizarre the first time I saw it I
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:50.720]  was just absolutely astounded but the more you look at it the more you see the
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:56.120]  pattern evolving everywhere it's a very widespread pattern let's go to Frank in
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:59.720]  North Carolina thank you Mark let's go to Frank in North Carolina Frank what
[03:02:59.720 --> 03:03:04.280]  do you think about this serious situation well I've got several points I want to
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:07.560]  make on that but first I'd like to suggest a movie for you in the audience
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:13.560]  to take a look at that I saw as a young boy it's called Capricorn 1 it's from
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:18.520]  1978 starring the good old evil Hal Holbrook and 9-11 Truth or James
[03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:25.320]  Brolin and the story basically dramatizes you know criminal elements of the
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:29.280]  government and the links that they go to to cover up their lives and conspiracies
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:33.480]  compartmentalism it's even got the Michael Hastings investigative
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:36.520]  reporter seen about Midway through the movie where they tamper with his car
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:42.200]  and kill yeah killing but anyway with a serious situation the Obama puppet
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:45.720]  regime seems to be saying that they don't want to attack or invade Syria but
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:50.400]  they've been left no choice but what what I'm coming from on this is you know
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:54.560]  Army General Wesley Clark stated that he was visiting one of his former offices
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:58.720]  this many years ago I forget it might have been the Pentagon or something but
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:01.880]  one of his officers took him aside and said hey you're not gonna believe what's
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:07.520]  going on I've been told we're gonna invade Afghanistan Iraq Syria Iran
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:13.000]  etc then you got the project for the American Century you know PNAC you
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:16.360]  know Syria was on their list of countries that they were going going to
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.520]  invade and then you got the secretary of the treasure George W. Bush appointee I
[03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:25.520]  believe his name was Paul O'Neill I've seen the interview on YouTube I think it
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:28.960]  might have been with Leslie Stahl or someone like that I think it was black
[03:04:28.960 --> 03:04:32.000]  out I don't think it ever aired but in that interview he stated that in his
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:37.080]  first cabinet meeting that he sat in they were told they were going to invade
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:41.880]  Afghanistan absolutely claim he claims that was months before 9-11 ever happened
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:45.360]  but oh yeah when I want to make it they decide what they're going to do we're
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:50.040]  out of time for today and and it's an amazing exciting time and it is time
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:54.600]  for you to get involved wake up other people tune them in to info wars.com
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:58.520]  and the alternative media and we're gonna be right back tomorrow at 11
