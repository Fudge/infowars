[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[00:10.000 --> 00:16.000]  I know you can see me now. Here's a surprise.
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  Owen Schreuer filling in for Alex Jones on a Sunday.
[00:20.000 --> 00:22.000]  The crew did a great job today getting this broadcast ready.
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.000]  A short staff crew and we are still live on a Sunday in the big studio.
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  And I'm feeling extra patriotic today. I have my American flag tie on with my American flag lapel.
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  I've got the classic blue jacket on. We've got the red, white and blue in the background flowing.
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  And that's because we're leading off today's broadcast with the good news.
[00:46.000 --> 00:54.000]  Rasmussen Polls reports Americans are happier than they have been in years.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  And a follow-up story from the Washington Examiner. Americans have never felt better.
[00:59.000 --> 01:09.000]  74% very happy. A new Rasmussen Report survey said that 74% of adults rate the life as good or excellent.
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  The highest level of satisfaction ever recorded by the pollster. How do you like that? Ever recorded?
[01:16.000 --> 01:27.000]  So according to this poll, Americans are happier than ever before. Isn't that incredible?
[01:27.000 --> 01:37.000]  Now I'm glad that Alex leaves this little ditty here lying at the desk because I have a feeling that on this Sunday, July 23rd,
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  I wouldn't be reading this headline if this headline were true.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  If this headline from Newsweek, Madame President was true from November 9th,
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  I wouldn't be reading you this headline from July 20th. Americans have never felt better.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  So you see how that works, folks?
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  Because this scathing, wicked witch of the West who still won't go away, this wretched creature,
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  you got her husband popping up on boats with Pierce Brosman now, looks like death warmed over.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  In fact, looks like death, not even warmed over anymore.
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  But they're in the past. That's the beauty of it. They are in the past and no matter what you think about Trump,
[02:23.000 --> 02:34.000]  Trump is trying to make America surge again and the momentum and the patriotism behind him are real.
[02:34.000 --> 02:44.000]  And that is why this Rasmussen poll indicates Americans are happier than ever before.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  Now it's resonating in other parts of life as well.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  Food stamps, food stamp use falls to lowest level in seven years.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  That is from Breitbart. Participation in the food stamp program took a dive to the lowest level.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  And in seven years, according to new data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  wow, how do you like that? You don't have to rely on the government for your daily meal.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  You don't have to rely on the government for ends meet and you end up happier.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  Shocking. Shocking.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  We've got some clips from Chuck Schumer. Oh, oh, oh, by the way, here's another news story.
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  This is from Gravian. As gas prices fall to a 12-year low. So there's the story to just add on to everything else here.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  Gas prices have just hit a 12-year low. We'll get the exact numbers.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  But despite that, you have Chuck Schumer who says that gas prices will never go down.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  The pastrami sandwich salesman who you would never buy a pastrami sandwich from.
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  The nationwide price for gas closed the week of July 17th at $2.39 a gallon.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  Down from $2.47 a gallon when Trump took office.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  So in seven months, the gas prices have gone down 8 cents a gallon.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  I suppose that's on average.
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  Over the July 4th holiday weekend, gas prices were at their lowest point since 2005.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  So that's what they're indicating lowest in the last 12 years.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  And this is crippling Russia's oil industry and gas market.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  But oh my gosh, Trump is a Russian agent.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  Can you believe this madman? Look at these headlines.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  Americans, they need less food stamps than ever before.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  Less America's on food stamps. Gas prices, 12-year low.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  Americans, happier than ever before, according to Rasmussen.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  Thanks, Russia. Thank you, Russia.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  Boy, I'm so glad that Russia got Trump in instead of Hillary
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  so I can come on air day with my American flag tie on
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  and say I'm better than I've ever felt before.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Thank you, Russia.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Now more from Chuck Schumer, the Fake American.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  All to make them march, make them protest,
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports,
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[05:52.000 --> 06:20.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  So we've covered the good news today.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  Americans are happier than they've ever been before.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  That's according to a Rasmussen poll.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  We have nothing but Russia to thank for that.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  You can just ask Chuck Schumer himself.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  Food stamp usage, the lowest in seven years.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  Gas prices, the lowest in 12 years.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  That's some of the stuff we've covered.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  More stuff to cover.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  A bunch of dead bodies have been found in a tractor trailer at a San Antonio Walmart.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  The San Antonio Police Chief William McManus has said we are looking at this
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  as a human trafficking issue.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  So we'll be sure to keep you posted on that.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  There's been some interesting coverage of that as well that we'll mention.
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  Joseph Rago, Wall Street Journal Editor, dies at 34.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  Now, this is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  You didn't hear too much about the unexpected death of Joseph Rago.
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  The last story he wrote for the Washington Post.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  I want to get the right headline here.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  The Obamacare Republicans, it was July 18th.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  Senate Republicans killed their own health care bill on Monday evening,
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  and it goes on and on.
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  So he was covering Obamacare.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  He was very critical of Obamacare, and he's dead.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  I'm not sure if there's anything to be suspicious of there.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  Just like there's nothing to be suspicious of with Peter Smith, Klaus Everwine,
[07:49.000 --> 07:58.000]  Sean Lucas, Barrington Weisenant, Seth Rich, Monica Peterson, John Ash.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  This is just about the last year and a half.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  I'm just going off memory here.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Did I forget any names? I forgot.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  DNC fraud lawsuit, Clinton body count.
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  I think I covered them all.
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  But nothing suspicious about that.
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.000]  People just dying weekend and week out will also keep you posted on anything developing
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  in the tractor trailer with the humans found on it.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  We've got some other stories as well.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  Hungarian PM, Soros EU, trying to establish a Muslimized Europe.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  We'll talk about that.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  And then there was some other weird news too.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  I think it was the Diliana files.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  Am I saying that right, Zach?
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  The Diliana files with John McCain implicated.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  So we'll look into that and this purple shovel program that I'd never heard of until today.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  So all kinds of weird stuff.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  And most of America has no clue about any of this.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  But that's fine because this is Trump's America now.
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  We are winning and Americans are happier than they've ever been before.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  But let's go to Chuck Schumer.
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  Chuck Schumer, he's not one of those Americans.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  Chuck Schumer might be more miserable than he's ever been before, actually, to be honest.
[09:03.000 --> 09:12.000]  And he was on the air with Stephanopoulos trying to talk about how its Democrats
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  that are going to fill the vacuum that Trump left, the vacuum that Trump left,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  which really doesn't make sense if you try to put that into context.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  He's been in office for seven months now.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  So I don't know how he's leaving vacuums.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  But this is Chuck Schumer trying to reason his way around thinking Trump is bad.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  Why don't Americans know where the Democrats stand for it and is that your fault?
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  Well, it is in part our fault when you lose an election.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  I think it's someone who has, say, 40% popularity.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  You look in the mirror and say, what did we do wrong?
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  And the number one thing that we did wrong is we didn't have...
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  Can we pause that?
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  See, this is what I'm talking about.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  This is what people like Chuck Schumer do.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  They just go on there and then they just say that as if it's a matter of fact.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.000]  Well, this is a president that has 40% approval rate.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  What are you talking about?
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.000]  What are you talking about?
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  Rigged polls again?
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  Rigged polls, Chuck Schumer?
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  I just highly doubt that President Trump's approval rating is really only 40% right now.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  But he just puts that out there like, see, Americans just hate this president.
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.000]  Americans just hate Trump.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  That's just a matter of fact.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  No, that's not a matter of fact.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  Keep rolling, Chuck Schumer.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  And the number one thing that we did wrong is we didn't have...
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  We didn't tell people what we stood for even today as your poll...
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  You don't stand for anything.
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  They like that.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  But they want to know what do you stand for.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  So tomorrow, Democrats will unveil our economic agenda.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's called a better deal.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  It has three components.
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  We're going to raise people's wages and create better paying jobs.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  We're going to cut down on their everyday expenses they have to pay.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  And we're going to give them the tools they need to compete in the 21st century.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  So simply put, what did Democrats stand for?
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  A better deal for working families.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  Higher wages, less costs.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  Like in Illinois?
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  California.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Is that where everyone's moving to Texas?
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  Part of that time.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  What took so long and why didn't it happen during the campaign?
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  Well, I don't know why it didn't happen in the campaign.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  We all take blame, not any one person.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  But now we have spent a lot of time working on this.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  And it's going to really impress the American people.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  It is not going to be left or right.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  It is going to be totally focused on working people who realize, believe correctly,
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  that the system is rigged against them.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  See, here's Chuck Schumer.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  Hold it for a second.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  Here's Chuck Schumer playing the typical liberal, the typical Democrat approach.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  We're going to help you.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  We're going to be here for you.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  You need higher wages.
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  We're going to take care of it.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  You need more money.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  You need food.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  You need.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.000]  You need.
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.000]  You need.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  You are a victim.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  You are in need.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  Didn't you know it?
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  Don't you know it?
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  I'm Chuck Schumer.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  You need a dirty pastrami sandwich.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  I'm Chuck Schumer.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  So he's telling you, you're in need.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  You need this.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  You're a victim.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  You've been scrutinized.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  You've been victimized.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  I'll help.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  We'll help.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  The Democrats will help.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  The government will help.
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  No.
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  No, Chuck Schumer.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  The government has got us here.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  But you know that, you're a dirty dealer.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  Go ahead and roll on with Chuck.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  Up Chuck.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  Yes.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  Well, are you going to appeal to the Obama coalition, you know, young people, LGBT, people
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  of color, or the...
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  Identity politics.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  Democrats who voted for Trump, blue-collar voters.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  This will appeal to both.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  But I have a different...
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.000]  If we'll unify the Democratic Party because we are united on economic issues and a bold,
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  sharp-edged message.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  Hold on.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  Hold it right there.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  Hold on.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  What...
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  What economic issues is he talking about here?
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.500]  Is he talking about the economic issues of the $20 trillion in debt this country is under?
[12:55.500 --> 12:56.500]  The deficit spending?
[12:56.500 --> 12:57.500]  I'm sorry.
[12:57.500 --> 12:58.500]  What is he exactly talking about?
[12:58.500 --> 13:02.720]  Because these were all prevalent during the Obama administration more than ever.
[13:02.720 --> 13:07.340]  So he's sitting here saying, we need to resonate with the people that supported Obama.
[13:07.340 --> 13:09.340]  The Obama people.
[13:09.340 --> 13:12.900]  We need to get behind our economic plan here.
[13:12.900 --> 13:14.660]  What economic plan?
[13:14.660 --> 13:16.100]  To put us into more debt?
[13:16.100 --> 13:21.240]  The economic plan that has California teetering on collapse, Illinois teetering on collapse?
[13:21.240 --> 13:22.360]  That economic plan?
[13:22.360 --> 13:27.200]  The economic plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on special elections and then go
[13:27.200 --> 13:30.000]  over that economic plan?
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.560]  How about the economic plan for Hillary Clinton's campaign?
[13:34.560 --> 13:35.840]  Did that work out for you?
[13:35.840 --> 13:37.920]  No, they have no economic plan.
[13:37.920 --> 13:39.280]  They have no deal.
[13:39.280 --> 13:40.400]  They have nothing.
[13:40.400 --> 13:42.520]  All they have is Trump bad.
[13:42.520 --> 13:43.520]  You're a victim.
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.520]  Trump is bad.
[13:44.520 --> 13:45.520]  That's all they have.
[13:45.520 --> 13:48.680]  Let's see if Chuck Schumer has anything else in this clip.
[13:48.680 --> 13:54.740]  Message, platform, policy, that talks about working people and how the system is rigged
[13:54.740 --> 13:55.740]  against them.
[13:55.740 --> 13:56.740]  There you are.
[13:56.740 --> 13:57.740]  You're a victim.
[13:57.740 --> 13:59.740]  This is the first time we're going to have it and our party's going to be unified.
[13:59.740 --> 14:02.240]  We've had a problem with wage stagnation.
[14:02.240 --> 14:03.240]  You talk about better wages.
[14:03.240 --> 14:04.240]  We had a problem with wage stagnation.
[14:04.240 --> 14:09.000]  I said the last 40 years, what can any piece of legislation do about that?
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.160]  Well, we have researched this thoroughly and talked to all different kinds of people and
[14:13.160 --> 14:15.800]  there are lots of things that we can do.
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.680]  And let me just say one more thing about this.
[14:17.680 --> 14:20.480]  Donald Trump campaigned sort of on this message.
[14:20.480 --> 14:21.800]  He was a populist.
[14:21.800 --> 14:23.920]  He campaigned against the establishment.
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.320]  As soon as he got into office, he embraced the Koch brother hard right and abandoned
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.480]  his plans to clean up Wall Street, to drain the swamp, to be tough on trade.
[14:33.480 --> 14:34.800]  Well, you'll be out of there soon.
[14:34.800 --> 14:35.800]  So calm down.
[14:35.800 --> 14:36.800]  In a way that's really...
[14:36.800 --> 14:38.760]  And he's definitely been tough on trade.
[14:38.760 --> 14:39.760]  What are you going to...
[14:39.760 --> 14:42.280]  This guy, look, the Democrats keep using this whole thing.
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.440]  They want to tell you that they're going to provide you a $15 an hour minimum wage.
[14:47.440 --> 14:48.440]  There was a story.
[14:48.440 --> 14:51.760]  It may have been my hometown of St. Louis guys looked this up.
[14:51.760 --> 14:53.800]  It might have been in Baltimore, actually.
[14:53.800 --> 14:54.920]  Maybe it was Baltimore.
[14:54.920 --> 14:58.760]  There was some mayor, some councilwoman and they had the whole thing proposed.
[14:58.760 --> 15:02.000]  They were about to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.760]  They had the votes, they had the bill and then they had to retract it because they realized
[15:07.760 --> 15:10.800]  that no one could afford to pay you anymore.
[15:10.800 --> 15:16.120]  So here were all these Democrats, here were all of these liberals, all pumped up, all
[15:16.120 --> 15:17.120]  fired up.
[15:17.120 --> 15:19.280]  They were going to get the minimum wage bill up.
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.720]  And then they actually looked at the logistics, broke it down economically, talked to the
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.800]  local business people and realized, hmm, this isn't going to work.
[15:29.800 --> 15:33.560]  Nobody can afford to pay you $15 an hour.
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.680]  And we don't have the robot workers quite in yet, so we can't just bring the robot workers
[15:38.680 --> 15:40.040]  in yet to replace you.
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.040]  That's another 10 years away.
[15:41.040 --> 15:43.760]  Yeah, there it is in Baltimore.
[15:43.760 --> 15:48.080]  So this is the same person, the same person that passed the bill to raise the minimum
[15:48.080 --> 15:50.120]  wage vetoed it.
[15:50.120 --> 15:52.800]  Mayor Catherine Pugh.
[15:52.800 --> 15:56.120]  I'm telling you folks, these people have no plan.
[15:56.120 --> 15:59.040]  We'll be right back with more of Up Truck Schumer.
[15:59.040 --> 16:03.800]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[16:03.800 --> 16:08.080]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact
[16:08.080 --> 16:13.360]  that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in
[16:13.360 --> 16:16.680]  many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[16:16.680 --> 16:22.280]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[16:22.280 --> 16:23.280]  and then processing.
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.640]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from
[16:28.640 --> 16:35.400]  chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the
[16:35.400 --> 16:37.120]  body at the same time.
[16:37.120 --> 16:39.400]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.

[16:44.400 --> 16:47.280]  and winning because of your support.

[19:04.480 --> 19:09.600]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[19:09.600 --> 19:13.640]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[19:13.640 --> 19:18.000]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.320]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[19:23.320 --> 19:29.720]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[19:29.720 --> 19:34.240]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[19:34.240 --> 19:36.720]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[19:36.720 --> 19:41.240]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[19:41.240 --> 19:43.840]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[19:43.840 --> 19:48.280]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[19:48.280 --> 19:51.760]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[19:51.760 --> 19:56.680]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[19:56.680 --> 20:02.040]  my favorite coffee available at InfoWarsLife.
[20:02.040 --> 20:16.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.320 --> 20:26.760]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[20:26.760 --> 20:30.840]  How absurd is it for us to love America here at InfoWars.com?
[20:30.840 --> 20:35.200]  I can't believe we love America, I can't believe we're patriots, I can't believe we like Trump,
[20:35.200 --> 20:39.760]  I can't believe we want America to remain a sovereign nation, I mean how dare us.
[20:39.760 --> 20:43.240]  I mean you've seen them on the news folks, how dare we want to sell our own products,
[20:43.240 --> 20:48.920]  so I mean I'm going to, even though Rachel Maddow said it's bad, I'm going to go ahead
[20:48.920 --> 20:53.120]  and let you know folks, we now have another new product.
[20:53.120 --> 20:57.120]  That is, I mean it's unbelievable that we want to bring you healthy products, that we
[20:57.120 --> 21:02.480]  want to fill your home with all natural deodorants and soaps and sunscreens and bug sprays and
[21:02.480 --> 21:06.720]  water filters and all that stuff, I mean I can't believe that patriots would want to
[21:06.720 --> 21:11.400]  fund one another and then help one other out and give them good products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[21:11.400 --> 21:16.240]  But we've decided to give you another product, you wanted the whey protein, so we decided
[21:16.240 --> 21:22.120]  that we were going to give you the whey protein, get the new true whey protein, and not only
[21:22.120 --> 21:28.040]  do we bring you new products, we bring you new products and we bring it with 25% off.
[21:28.040 --> 21:36.320]  So 25% off, the introduction of the true whey protein, ultimate protein pack, is the 25%
[21:36.320 --> 21:40.840]  off caveman and true whey protein if you want to do the protein pack, but folks you're
[21:40.840 --> 21:44.320]  going to love this new whey protein, I know a lot of people that do whey protein, it's
[21:44.320 --> 21:49.040]  a very popular product, I'm obviously going to be switching to the true whey protein at
[21:49.040 --> 21:55.840]  InfoWarsStore.com and it's a grass-fed whey protein and it's got 9 essential amino acids
[21:55.840 --> 21:59.520]  that your body needs that can't produce itself.
[21:59.520 --> 22:03.280]  So and I got to tell you, we've actually had bottles of this floating around the office,
[22:03.280 --> 22:07.040]  we've been shooting ads, Alex has been shooting some ads telling you about this new protein
[22:07.040 --> 22:12.960]  folks, it is honestly, I don't like vanilla proteins, I maybe got one vanilla protein
[22:12.960 --> 22:16.760]  in my entire life, didn't like it, I've been chocolate ever since.
[22:16.760 --> 22:23.120]  This is the best tasting vanilla anything I've ever tasted, better than any ice cream
[22:23.120 --> 22:25.120]  even if you got two scoops.
[22:25.120 --> 22:29.920]  If you get two scoops of true whey vanilla protein, it's better than two scoops of any
[22:29.920 --> 22:34.360]  coffefe ice cream that you've ever had, but I'm telling you, the protein, all natural,
[22:34.360 --> 22:39.680]  grass-fed and the flavor is the best tasting, probably protein in general, but definitely
[22:39.680 --> 22:42.280]  the best tasting vanilla protein I've ever had.
[22:42.280 --> 22:49.000]  So try out True Whey Protein at InfowarsStore.com, that's 25% off retail and don't forget the
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.880]  ultimate protein pack, 25% off caveman and True Whey protein combined.
[22:54.880 --> 22:57.880]  Can tell you folks, a lot of you out there use whey protein, a lot of people that are
[22:57.880 --> 23:03.920]  into exercising and working out, lifting weights, you do the protein after your workout.
[23:03.920 --> 23:09.960]  Now you've got a source, InfowarsStore.com to get an all natural protein and support
[23:09.960 --> 23:11.080]  this broadcast.
[23:11.080 --> 23:15.000]  So check that out and you will be a returned customer, I guarantee it.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.440]  Can't wait to see those five star reviews coming in.
[23:17.440 --> 23:22.800]  All right, well, we were given Chuck, excuse me, Up Chuck Schumer the business before we
[23:22.800 --> 23:24.680]  went to the last break.
[23:24.680 --> 23:29.400]  Let's finish up with this Chuck Schumer clip from, what show is this?
[23:29.400 --> 23:31.200]  We have George Step on all of us.
[23:31.200 --> 23:34.760]  Okay, so this is Up Chuck Schumer on George Step on all of us.
[23:34.760 --> 23:36.680]  Let's go ahead and finish this clip.
[23:36.680 --> 23:39.480]  We are going to propose tomorrow.
[23:39.480 --> 23:43.640]  We've already proposed a few things, a trillion dollar infrastructure plan, Trump, I don't
[23:43.640 --> 23:46.680]  know where he is on infrastructure, but we'll put him on that.
[23:46.680 --> 23:47.680]  He's clueless.
[23:47.680 --> 23:52.160]  We've proposed already a $15 minimum wage, Trump won't go for that.
[23:52.160 --> 23:57.000]  We've proposed to child care, a family leave proposal that works well.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.200]  Here's what we're going to propose tomorrow.
[23:59.200 --> 24:01.800]  Number one, we're going to go after the drug companies.
[24:01.800 --> 24:08.960]  We will create a special, special office that will just go after these drug companies when
[24:08.960 --> 24:13.800]  they raise prices so egregiously and people can't afford these drugs.
[24:13.800 --> 24:15.800]  All right, pause it right there.
[24:15.800 --> 24:16.800]  Wow.
[24:16.800 --> 24:26.120]  Chuck Schumer wants to go after drug companies that raise the prices astronomically.
[24:26.120 --> 24:30.840]  What else is going on in the medical industry right now where prices are being raised astronomically?
[24:30.840 --> 24:34.240]  Oh, that's right, Obamacare.
[24:34.240 --> 24:36.760]  Obamacare.
[24:36.760 --> 24:43.240]  Premium skyrocketing, deductible skyrocketing, monthly rate skyrocketing.
[24:43.240 --> 24:50.120]  Oh, but Chuck Schumer wants to make sure that the drug companies aren't skyrocketing their
[24:50.120 --> 24:51.120]  prices.
[24:51.120 --> 24:55.800]  I mean, this is so hypocritical.
[24:55.800 --> 25:00.840]  This is so the pot calling the kettle black that it makes you nauseous that there's even
[25:00.840 --> 25:05.920]  a human being that would get up and lie to you and be such a fraud like this.
[25:05.920 --> 25:12.480]  So again, Obamacare premiums, skyrocketing, just nobody can afford it anymore.
[25:12.480 --> 25:15.680]  But here's Chuck Schumer, he's going to do something about the drug companies raising
[25:15.680 --> 25:16.680]  their prices.
[25:16.680 --> 25:23.200]  Wait a second, up Chuck, I thought that that was what Obamacare was for.
[25:23.200 --> 25:25.880]  I guess Obamacare failed again.
[25:25.880 --> 25:30.600]  Oh, and you notice that Chuck Schumer has no problem with the opioid epidemic, doesn't
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.600]  mention that.
[25:31.600 --> 25:35.640]  He's going to go after the big drug companies because they're rising prices, but ignore
[25:35.640 --> 25:38.560]  all of the deaths that are associated with that.
[25:38.560 --> 25:39.560]  That's just fine.
[25:39.560 --> 25:42.160]  Let's go back to up Chuck.
[25:42.160 --> 25:43.840]  And people can't afford these drugs.
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.520]  We're going to change the way companies can merge.
[25:47.520 --> 25:53.160]  We have these huge companies buying up other companies, it hurts workers and it hurts prices.
[25:53.160 --> 25:56.960]  The old Adam Smith idea of competition, it's gone.
[25:56.960 --> 26:00.400]  So people hate it when their cable bills go up, their airline fees.
[26:00.400 --> 26:01.560]  They know that gas prices.
[26:01.560 --> 26:06.960]  But again, Obamacare is skyrocketing, hold them right there, so again, again he's sitting
[26:06.960 --> 26:11.360]  here complaining about prices going up, again he's saying he's going to get involved, we're
[26:11.360 --> 26:15.200]  going to get the government involved, we're going to stop these rising prices, doesn't
[26:15.200 --> 26:16.200]  mention Obamacare.
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.880]  This guy's on the hill every day defending Obamacare.
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.560]  And then he goes on George Step on all of us on ABC and says, I'm going to stop the prices
[26:26.560 --> 26:28.480]  on the drugs from getting too big.
[26:28.480 --> 26:32.440]  We're going to stop big companies from buying one another and then making the prices too
[26:32.440 --> 26:37.160]  big on your energy bill, your electricity bill, your cable bill and all this.
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.320]  Meanwhile, the Democrats made unaffordable healthcare and they want to kill the coal
[26:41.320 --> 26:44.640]  industry that keeps energy affordable.
[26:44.640 --> 26:49.280]  Trump has got the gas to the lowest price in 12 years, it's hurting the Russia.
[26:49.280 --> 26:52.920]  This guy's up here complaining.
[26:52.920 --> 26:55.080]  Go back to up Chuck.
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.440]  The domestic price goes, when the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right
[27:01.440 --> 27:02.440]  up, but it never goes down.
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.400]  How the heck did we let it start a global emergency, so we're going to go and pause
[27:07.400 --> 27:08.400]  it right there.
[27:08.400 --> 27:11.920]  Again though, again though, no mention of Amazon buying out everything and then having
[27:11.920 --> 27:16.360]  a deal with the United States Postal Service, no mention of Google and Alphabet and those
[27:16.360 --> 27:21.200]  big services buying up everything, no mention of the six industries or the six companies
[27:21.200 --> 27:25.040]  that own all the media, no, no, no, Schumer has no problem with that.
[27:25.040 --> 27:29.760]  But then he tells you that gas prices never go down even though they're the lowest they've
[27:29.760 --> 27:33.660]  been in 12 years.
[27:33.660 --> 27:35.160]  Go back to up Chuck Schumer.
[27:35.160 --> 27:40.000]  So we're going to go after that and that will help the average person lower their cost.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.840]  And finally, we're going to have tomorrow a very novel idea of how to create 10 million
[27:44.840 --> 27:45.840]  jobs.
[27:45.840 --> 27:48.280]  There are 10 million Americans looking for good paying jobs.
[27:48.280 --> 27:49.880]  We're going to show them how to find them.
[27:49.880 --> 27:50.880]  And that's just the beginning.
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.760]  Week after week, month after month, we're going to roll out specific pieces here that
[27:55.760 --> 27:58.600]  are quite different than the Democratic Party you heard in the past.
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.000]  We were too cautious.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  We were too namby-pamby.
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  This is short.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  Namby-pamby?
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  Namby-pamby?
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.120]  Hold on, hold on, hold on right there.
[28:06.120 --> 28:08.240]  You want to talk about namby-pamby?
[28:08.240 --> 28:10.440]  You want to talk about namby-pamby?
[28:10.440 --> 28:15.680]  Mamby-pamby is looking to the government or looking at Chuck Schumer for a job.
[28:15.680 --> 28:20.400]  Looking at the government, looking at Chuck Schumer, please give me more money, please.
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.360]  Please make the bad Trump break up the big businesses.
[28:23.360 --> 28:25.560]  Make the bad Trump raise the minimum wage.
[28:25.560 --> 28:28.040]  Please make the bad Trump go after the drug companies.
[28:28.040 --> 28:29.040]  Please.
[28:29.040 --> 28:30.040]  It's the bad Trump.
[28:30.040 --> 28:31.040]  Please help me.
[28:31.040 --> 28:32.040]  Help me.
[28:32.040 --> 28:33.040]  No.
[28:33.040 --> 28:34.040]  You know what the answer is?
[28:34.040 --> 28:35.040]  Help your damn self.
[28:35.040 --> 28:37.040]  This is America.
[28:37.040 --> 28:38.880]  Up Chuck Schumer's telling you you're a victim.
[28:38.880 --> 28:39.880]  You can't do it.
[28:39.880 --> 28:40.880]  We're going to help you.
[28:40.880 --> 28:41.880]  I'm Chuck Schumer.
[28:41.880 --> 28:42.880]  I'm going to be the guy.
[28:42.880 --> 28:46.400]  This guy's the dirtiest, crookedest, nastiest politician on the face of the earth.
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.080]  You wouldn't buy a pastrami sandwich from him if he was a deli man.
[28:50.080 --> 28:51.080]  Disgusting people.
[28:51.080 --> 28:53.720]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones show.
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.640]  Up Chuck Schumer wants to be your daddy.
[28:57.640 --> 29:01.160]  Just 6% of Americans say the Russian collusion conspiracy theory is important.
[29:01.160 --> 29:04.840]  The Daily Wire pointed out that in a Bloomberg survey pulling Americans on what they feel
[29:04.840 --> 29:08.600]  is the most important issues concerning the Trump administration, 35% said healthcare,
[29:08.600 --> 29:13.320]  13% said the economy, 11% said terrorism, and immediately 6% said President Trump's
[29:13.320 --> 29:16.040]  relationship with Russia was an important issue for them.
[29:16.040 --> 29:20.000]  Then why does the mainstream media spend so much time focusing on the Russia conspiracy
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  theory?
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  Simple.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.520]  They want to undermine the Trump presidency to appease their bosses.
[29:23.520 --> 29:26.200]  The globalist owners of major news corporations.
[29:26.200 --> 29:28.520]  You see the best forms of propaganda spread through deception.
[29:28.520 --> 29:32.320]  In the mainstream media role plays as objective journalists while pushing a globalist agenda.
[29:32.320 --> 29:33.520]  But don't take it from me.
[29:33.520 --> 29:36.240]  Just look at the Bloomberg article that accompanied the poll.
[29:36.240 --> 29:37.800]  Americans feel good about the economy.
[29:37.800 --> 29:39.440]  Not so good about Trump, the headline read.
[29:39.440 --> 29:40.440]  Oh really?
[29:40.440 --> 29:43.640]  The top three issues that Americans find important are the top issues that President Trump ran
[29:43.640 --> 29:44.680]  on during his campaign.
[29:44.680 --> 29:48.760]  The mainstream media hates Trump for bringing back Americana in the belief in national self
[29:48.760 --> 29:49.760]  determination.
[29:49.760 --> 29:52.640]  And that's why they keep pushing the Russian collusion conspiracy theory, which CNN's
[29:52.640 --> 29:54.840]  Van Jones even admitted was a nothing burger.
[29:54.840 --> 29:57.160]  This is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com.
[29:57.160 --> 30:02.120]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA forces finally arrived
[30:02.120 --> 30:04.240]  at the Infowars Warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[30:04.240 --> 30:08.360]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for auto-ship to receive
[30:08.360 --> 30:12.120]  out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out
[30:12.120 --> 30:16.360]  very, very soon, and when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force,
[30:16.360 --> 30:20.760]  we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[30:20.760 --> 30:25.880]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ-10,
[30:25.880 --> 30:30.560]  systematic enzymes, NAR-lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[30:30.560 --> 30:35.960]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies, and just one batch of
[30:35.960 --> 30:38.960]  this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[30:38.960 --> 31:04.000]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.000]  That's right.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.720]  It's time to build your own food storage with HarvestWrite's FreezeDryers.

[31:26.520 --> 31:31.360]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about, and when compared to traditional methods of preservation
[31:31.360 --> 31:35.520]  like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is
[31:35.520 --> 31:37.240]  no comparison.
[31:37.240 --> 31:43.080]  HarvestWrite FreezeDryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value

[32:39.000 --> 32:42.840]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that have terrible bowel
[32:42.840 --> 32:46.000]  and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago, now it's epidemic, but I'm getting
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.480]  ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for
[32:48.480 --> 32:51.600]  them because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[32:51.600 --> 33:02.680]  Probiotic MycozX contains seven of the world's most powerful, organic, and well-crafted ingredients
[33:02.680 --> 33:04.480]  designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms, start fighting
[33:04.480 --> 33:05.480]  back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycozX.
[33:05.480 --> 33:32.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to talk to you today about
[33:32.920 --> 33:40.040]  the basic survival, not just of Western society, but of the family and the human community
[33:40.040 --> 33:41.800]  itself.
[33:41.800 --> 33:48.680]  The technocrats, as the world's ruling elite call themselves, are incredibly selfish people
[33:48.680 --> 33:56.160]  and they admit that they have a plan to balkanize nations and turn peoples against each other
[33:56.160 --> 34:02.240]  so they can be easily ruled via divide and conquer, but first the nation state itself
[34:02.240 --> 34:07.760]  must be taken over by private corporate combines and foreign groups then need to be brought
[34:07.760 --> 34:18.120]  in who are clothed and fed and brainwashed by the state to be destabilization forces.
[34:18.120 --> 34:26.040]  Now this is not my opinion, on screen is an article from 2012 from the BBC that's promoting
[34:26.040 --> 34:33.640]  world government via open borders and it says the EU should, under my national homogeneity,
[34:33.640 --> 34:40.000]  says UN migration chief, should open the borders to Africa and to the Middle East to then bring
[34:40.000 --> 34:49.520]  in the groups who are not from free countries to force Europeans to then adopt systems that
[34:49.520 --> 34:55.960]  will not quote upset the Islamists and others and examples of this are in Germany they tell
[34:55.960 --> 34:59.600]  women don't wear short skirts it will make the Muslims mad they're starting to not have
[34:59.600 --> 35:05.160]  outdoor October fest because the Muslims will attack people drinking beer the Muslims are
[35:05.160 --> 35:11.080]  attacking people walking dogs saying they're unclean and now in schools in the US but also
[35:11.080 --> 35:17.040]  in Europe and places in Austria they're banning pork in school lunches because Muslims are
[35:17.040 --> 35:18.400]  upset about it.
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.560]  Well Orthodox Jews don't eat pork but they don't then demand that the schools don't
[35:23.560 --> 35:30.640]  serve it this is all about total and complete control they're bringing in groups like Orthodox
[35:30.640 --> 35:34.600]  radical Muslims who won't even get along with each other in their own countries and
[35:34.600 --> 35:40.520]  have constant civil war they are so cult like and they admit that they're going to make
[35:40.520 --> 35:49.720]  Europe the United States Australia adopt authoritarian codes to quote accommodate the Muslims ladies
[35:49.720 --> 35:54.080]  and gentlemen this is how we're being culturally conquered first they get us to be open to
[35:54.080 --> 35:59.040]  the gays and then you know to be open to this group or that group and then next they're
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.040]  saying we're going to teach your children about how to have sex when they're five years
[36:02.040 --> 36:06.320]  old and how to masturbate in schools but we're going to bring in Muslims that throw gay people
[36:06.320 --> 36:09.040]  off buildings and you're going to submit to them as well but you're not going to give
[36:09.040 --> 36:13.680]  out Christmas cards as we've seen cases around the country at Christmas at school because
[36:13.680 --> 36:19.920]  of separation in church and state separation of church and state ladies and gentlemen
[36:19.920 --> 36:23.920]  says that the government can't have an official religion it doesn't mean you can't hand out
[36:23.920 --> 36:31.080]  Christmas cards but only Christians libertarians conservatives nationalists free market folks
[36:31.080 --> 36:36.240]  very diverse group only we have to give up our speech and shut up well here's a new
[36:36.240 --> 36:40.480]  article today of the David Knight knowing sure I'm going to be breaking down a little
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.960]  bit later here on the live transmission from WorldNet Daily simply pointing out a UN document
[36:44.960 --> 36:50.120]  from 2000 telling folks oh we need to bring in the folks from Africa we need to bring
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.800]  in the Muslims then they pay the UN does along with Peter Sutherland the UN George Soros
[36:55.800 --> 37:00.680]  with our tax money to bring the people 100 miles off the coast of international waters
[37:00.680 --> 37:08.360]  then the EU Navy comes and quote rescues them and brings them in to be resettled and Italian
[37:08.360 --> 37:13.760]  homeowners and hotel owners are being thrown out their guests are being thrown out and
[37:13.760 --> 37:20.440]  the Islamist 80 plus percent military aged men being brought in are then put on welfare
[37:20.440 --> 37:27.240]  this is the idea this is the program and they say it is to quote replace Europeans then
[37:27.240 --> 37:33.400]  they teach in the news that white people are fundamentally evil and fundamentally bad
[37:33.400 --> 37:40.680]  and need to be gotten rid of and that white genocide is now taught in colleges so again
[37:40.680 --> 37:45.120]  the race based Hitlerian plan whether it's carried out by whites or carried out by others
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.160]  is always very attractive during the Bible different tribes are always exterminating
[37:49.160 --> 37:56.280]  each other but the big mega banks are coming in with the seven billion plus people it'll
[37:56.280 --> 38:01.440]  be nine billion in just a few years in the third world and using them as weapons against
[38:01.440 --> 38:07.000]  the West after the globalists have already exploited the continent of Africa exploited
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.640]  other areas but they're not bringing in people in ultra massive numbers from say Brazil or
[38:11.640 --> 38:15.120]  other areas that have more libertarian or conservative backgrounds they're bringing
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.720]  people in out of savage Muslim countries where women are kept as animals failed states like
[38:20.720 --> 38:30.920]  Somalia and Sudan so to counter this I am announcing a $20,000 contest because the media
[38:30.920 --> 38:35.240]  made fun of the video that I put out a few months ago and super deluxe turned it into
[38:35.240 --> 38:41.200]  a video that had 20 million views in the last week where I sung about how they basically
[38:41.200 --> 38:49.520]  cover up there's a massive cover up when Islamists in Europe rape bomb shoot stab run people
[38:49.520 --> 38:58.320]  over with cars and so I basically made a joke and said we love our Somalis we love our Muslims
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.520]  too oh they so good oh they so sweet because when somebody screams Allah Akbar and stabs
[39:03.520 --> 39:07.680]  people whether it's in San Francisco whether it's in Minneapolis St. Paul or whether it's
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.920]  in New York City or somebody shoots a cop in the back of the head yelling Allah Akbar
[39:11.920 --> 39:17.160]  national media won't report it so we're going to expose the type of immigrants the type
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.240]  of invaders the types that are being brought in that'll be clear you can't go to Sudan
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.440]  you can't go to Somalia you can't go to Saudi Arabia and be a Christian you can't be a
[39:26.440 --> 39:30.200]  woman and not wear a burqa over your head you can't be a woman and drive a car or go
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.200]  shopping without your mail controller you can't be gay without being murdered so standing
[39:35.200 --> 39:41.000]  up against these human rights abuses and standing up against this anti-western tyranny so to
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.480]  counter this sinister move by global government forces to crush what's left of the last few
[39:46.480 --> 39:52.520]  free nations that exist using huge third world hordes of Islamists that have already been
[39:52.520 --> 39:57.600]  exploited and stirred up by the globalist we're launching an epic contest where you

[45:16.920 --> 45:22.280]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[45:22.280 --> 45:27.360]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but to

[50:29.080 --> 50:34.000]  ways to mark you with the beast but here's the story that I really wanted to break down
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.680]  because this is so key to me and from some of the that someone that actually has to deal
[50:38.680 --> 50:43.080]  with this on the front line just like the fan it's like you know the the Bon Iver cover

[51:07.000 --> 51:12.280]  have you ever heard of such a thing it's not a protest when you're getting paid to do it
[51:12.280 --> 51:19.200]  it's not a redress of grievances with the government when you're on salary no that's
[51:19.200 --> 51:27.200]  that now that's your job here's a quote terrified about Trump quit your job start an
[51:27.200 --> 51:36.120]  A team we must just but we might just fund it terrified about Trump let's I mean just
[51:36.120 --> 51:42.480]  look at this propaganda from the very beginning folks this is why this angers me so much because
[51:42.480 --> 51:49.400]  this is so targeted at the youth this is such an attempt to brainwash the youth that it
[51:49.400 --> 51:56.640]  it really sickens me terrified about Trump as if there's some reason to be terrified
[51:56.640 --> 52:00.920]  about Trump the only reason I could think of you being terrified about Trump is if you're
[52:00.920 --> 52:08.080]  some sicko pedophile in DC or maybe you're an illegal citizen here raping people murdering
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.400]  people then yeah you might be terrified of Donald Trump maybe you're a corrupt politician
[52:13.400 --> 52:18.480]  then maybe Trump terrifies you but they're acting like you the average American the average
[52:18.480 --> 52:24.240]  citizen you should be terrified about Trump in fact not that you should be in fact you
[52:24.240 --> 52:30.080]  are you are terrified about Trump and it's not because the mainstream media has been
[52:30.080 --> 52:40.960]  lying about him for over a year but going on two years plus now and so they blame Trump
[52:40.960 --> 52:45.760]  because the media lies about him all day long so there you go so there's there's just one
[52:45.760 --> 52:53.840]  element of their propaganda then it goes on quit your job quit your job quit your job
[52:53.840 --> 53:01.920]  quit your job folks just quit your job pick up a street sign and chant in the streets
[53:01.920 --> 53:09.600]  so fight for the futures a teams project page is now going to offer as much as $15,000 for
[53:09.600 --> 53:14.640]  the first month to political activism teams to fight a wide range of social and political
[53:14.640 --> 53:22.560]  issues listed on the website including health care affordable affordable care act climate
[53:22.560 --> 53:26.960]  immigration the wall corruption racism fascism police prisons
[53:29.840 --> 53:33.040]  so they tell you that you're terrified about Trump why
[53:34.880 --> 53:39.920]  because of health care their first reason the affordable care act so it doesn't matter that
[53:39.920 --> 53:45.600]  obama cares failing it doesn't matter that you don't have as many options as it used to have
[53:45.600 --> 53:49.360]  some counties where you only have one option it's monopoly care some counties where you might not
[53:49.360 --> 53:54.320]  have any options now it doesn't matter that premiums are skyrocketing deductible skyrocketing and
[53:54.320 --> 53:59.760]  options being limited so price is going up that's how monopolies work you're scared of Trump
[54:01.120 --> 54:06.160]  you see you're scared of Trump because he's going after that health care bill that's so great
[54:06.160 --> 54:12.000]  that they lied to you about climate and so they always see they have these little buzzwords this
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.800]  is how they brainwash you they lied to you about climate change they lied to you about the affordable
[54:16.800 --> 54:21.440]  care act they lied to you about immigration they lied to you about racism they lied to you about
[54:21.440 --> 54:27.760]  everything then when somebody comes along like Trump or alex jones or it could be anyone when
[54:27.760 --> 54:34.160]  someone comes along and tells you the truth when someone has the nerve to actually tell you the
[54:34.160 --> 54:44.560]  truth to stand up in a world of lies a world of deceit and tell you the truth you must be terrified
[54:44.560 --> 54:57.600]  you have to quit your job you have to start the a team and we will fund it
[55:01.600 --> 55:04.480]  so it's not a protest when it's your job
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.640]  you're not terrified about Trump when you've been lied to about him
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.560]  and we've already seen these people that are going to sign up for this type of crap
[55:19.040 --> 55:26.160]  and it will equal nothing and just like every other time when I hit the streets
[55:26.800 --> 55:32.080]  and I asked these Trump protesters what they're out here doing why they don't like Trump what he
[55:32.080 --> 55:38.880]  said that's racist what he's done this misogynist what do they know about the Paris climate accord
[55:38.880 --> 55:42.800]  what do you know about health care what do you actually know about any of this stuff
[55:44.320 --> 55:50.640]  they have nothing and they will continue to have nothing except now they might have a couple thousand
[55:50.640 --> 56:00.640]  bucks to uh play around with and it just goes on it tells them how they can organize it tells
[56:00.640 --> 56:05.600]  them that they need to hook up with people that are like-minded and go out and be active and do all
[56:05.600 --> 56:16.960]  this and they have enough brainwashed Stockholm syndrome victims thanks to liberal education
[56:16.960 --> 56:22.560]  liberal media that they will actually get people to sign up and go out on the streets and do all of it
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.800]  and George Soros is the man behind the curtain as usual
[56:28.800 --> 56:39.280]  so think about this you've got Democrats spending hundreds of millions of dollars
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.480]  on failed elections not just Hillary Clinton but in the special elections going all out
[56:46.720 --> 56:54.240]  so now you've got the DNC this is from the Daily Caller DNC finished last month
[56:54.240 --> 57:01.920]  third three excuse me 3.3 million dollars in debt the Democratic National Committee is struggling
[57:01.920 --> 57:09.840]  to win elections and now it's 3.3 million dollars in debt the DNC raised just five and a half million
[57:09.840 --> 57:15.840]  over the June fundraising period and outspent themselves by 200 000 finishing the month with
[57:15.840 --> 57:28.800]  3.3 million in debt you know who we heard from in the first hour up Chuck Schumer who told you that

[57:49.680 --> 57:55.600]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of
[57:55.600 --> 58:02.560]  war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago
[58:02.560 --> 58:08.960]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid
[58:08.960 --> 58:15.840]  sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food
[58:15.840 --> 58:22.240]  and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate

[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:15.280]  i don't care about that i just want the cardashians i moved out to the middle of nowhere east texas
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.440]  nine years ago not expecting anything to help them my family out country boy can't survive
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:32.640]  well what i found out was it's a lot more efficient to raise your own animals raise your own
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:40.480]  grow your own garden yeah i got a huge garden yeah you probably honestly you probably most of people
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.560]  i know that that end up gardening and have big gardens end up having too much produce they give
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:51.360]  a lot of it away yeah and we give a lot of eggs away because i got so many chickens i got turkeys
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:58.160]  i got guineas i got everything out here so the world's going insane i would agree with that uh the
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.440]  liberal brain you know what though here's an interesting point though here's an interesting
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:08.160]  point that i actually want to make on that because i do agree with you for the most part um liberalism
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.960]  has become a mental disorder oh but i hate you know it's only in the modern day construct uh
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.760]  because the true liberalism you know there's a whole historical construct of liberalism and
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.680]  then there's a whole modern day liberalism but the audience understands what i'm getting at
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:30.640]  but here's the here's the key thing to me that i think is just a universal fact at least from
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:36.560]  my observation and it kind of goes along with what you're saying yes the world is insane yes people
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:43.680]  have been brainwashed yes people have been fluoridated into complete capitulation this is all going on
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:51.280]  i have even in fact fallen victim to it but here's the key here's the key where is there a where is
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.200]  a group of people show me the group of people show me the movement show me the momentum for people
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:03.120]  that are leaving the republican party and becoming democrats show me the movement of people that are
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:09.840]  going from the red pill to the blue pill do you understand what i'm saying so even though
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.360]  there's still mass Stockholm syndrome even though there's still mass brainwashing even so there's
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:22.480]  still this mass you know hypnosis that the general population is in there is hope for them
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.880]  they can wait they can be woke they can be red pilled they can become a patriot they can become
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.200]  a freedom fighter they can live in reality there is hope for these people they can come back to
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:39.200]  reality but on the other side of the spectrum i don't see it going the other way i don't see people
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.800]  on our side of the fence i don't see our people going to maxine waters i don't see any trump
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.840]  supporter going to up chuck schumer you know what i'm saying so even though the world is collectively
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:55.760]  insane there is hope for them to come around and then once they come around they're never going back

[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:23.200]  your host owin shroyer well people have been telling you about this for a long time and it's really
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:29.040]  just history repeating itself except now you have the wind of george soros or whatever's left of him
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:38.480]  forcing this the hungarian p m actually let's start with the story from associated press
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:46.720]  hungry's leader e u and soros seek to muslimize europe european union leaders and hungarian american
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:52.960]  billionaire george soros are seeking a new mixed muslimized culture hungry's anti-migration prime
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:58.160]  minister said saturday they have to throw that anti-migration in there they can't just say prime
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:05.600]  minister they got to always have a little liberal jab always have a little you know a little sieve
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:12.080]  just uh just to poke ya a little bit just to just to discredit you when they when they try to cover you
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:18.000]  and then uh pamela galler picked it up today and went with the story but a lot of people
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.720]  have been talking about this for a long time the overarching agenda uh in the middle east
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:29.040]  the class of civilization the multiculturalism and so you've seen what's happening you know
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:35.280]  george soros is behind it but there was another interesting story that i saw and david night
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.760]  covered that last week but then there was another weird angle that i saw this was a story that came
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:47.760]  out of the associated press and then got picked up by yahoo despairing young italians seek greener
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:54.000]  pastures abroad now there's been a lot of news coming out of italy how the migration problem has
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.600]  reached unprecedented levels they have so many boats coming in filled with these migrants they get
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:03.760]  to the port and they can't they don't even have room at these super ports now they're trying to
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.320]  get more ports to bring them in uh now they're actually trying to slow it down so they know
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:14.160]  that's going on they can't find a job uh italians are getting sick of it you know italians you know
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:20.240]  they don't like getting pushed around but the strange thing i found about this story was that
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:30.400]  when i went back to the afp to read it they had pulled the story so the original source of the
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:39.120]  story has pulled the story but yahoo hasn't pulled it yet so it's still on yahoo and you know you
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:48.080]  know exactly what happened folks the editor said we can't run that headline italy's great nobody
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.640]  wants to leave italy multiculturalism is winning open borders are winning all mass migration is
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:59.280]  winning there's no cause for concern everybody loves italy nobody's leaving we can't run that
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:07.200]  story so they deleted it but miscommunication yahoo still has the story up so you can still read it
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.640]  if you want to hear about this story and why italians are struggling to make ends meet find a
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:19.280]  life for themselves and why they want to leave but if you're the associated free press well we're
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.600]  just gonna go ahead and have to pull that that's not politically correct enough for us let's go
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.840]  to judy who wants to talk about economy judy's in florida go ahead judy hey oh and i think you're
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:36.720]  doing a great job um i really like listening to you uh you just diverted my attention away from
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.280]  the original topic they'll give it a segue though but um this is called white flight
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:50.960]  what what you are describing uh in the ap article that that has been pulled what's happening in italy
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.960]  and uh you said it was called white i'm sorry you said it was called white flight
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:01.520]  yes uh essentially the whites are gonna you know they're being displaced at this point um i i
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.800]  just got a statistic uh earlier today that um we're london was 90 white 70 years ago
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:17.520]  is now only 40 white and that's from tara mccarthy who is a london dur that is actually
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.960]  looking to emigrate and stay in the united states but be that as it may i mean that that's just
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.800]  something that is going to be a natural occurrence because of all the cultural enrichment but yes
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:38.240]  yeah i mean i love this cultural enrichment um we love our somalis we love our cultural enrichment
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:45.760]  right in the knife in our back you got that right um but what i was going to say about the economy
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:53.040]  is just um i was listening to catherine austin fitz talked to greg hunter recently and anybody can
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.720]  look up that talk and i think it's really important what they were saying with each other um essentially
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.720]  i think we need to hold trump's feet to the fire in that um he's going to do a wonderful job with
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:11.840]  with our military and i believe that military spending is important for our nation but we
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:18.880]  need to ensure that what has been stolen from us through like banker bailouts and what have you
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:25.520]  we do reclaim legally because that was done illegally in order to have those
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:33.760]  are you talking about the obama bailouts yeah essentially okay but what would need what needs
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.760]  to be injected back into our you know what actually you know you actually you actually
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:46.880]  raise a very unique point that i've never heard anyone raise before and that is looking at some
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.160]  of the things obama did you could say the iran deal and trump is actually going it looks like
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.680]  trump is going to go ahead and certify that iran deal something he said he wouldn't something he
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:02.240]  said was a bad thing so okay you can raise an issue with that but you know that's a good point
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.320]  you talk about the banker bailouts you talk about all these bailouts that obama has had
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.760]  you talk about bailing out obama care with freddy mayan or freddy and fanny
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.640]  so yeah that's an interesting point it's never really been raised i've never heard anyone raise
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.480]  it i don't you know trump's got his hand here's the thing i'm not just trying to play apologist
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.040]  for trump i'm just trying to deal with reality here trump's got so many different things going
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.840]  on i mean my gosh i can even i can barely even manage like if i've got three stories i'm working
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.520]  on and like three different guests i'm trying like i can even barely manage that i can't even imagine
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.480]  what trump is dealing with i mean sleep six hours a day or whatever and deals with thousands of people
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.840]  around the world at the same time so i don't even know if that's anything that's on his radar but
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.480]  that's an interesting point especially with the banker bailout i mean that i mean my goodness
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.360]  and these people want to complain all day about getting more money to the people out there that
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.680]  have been disenfranchised what a bunch of frauds anything else judy well i mean i i'm in agreement
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.560]  with what you're saying i absolutely love trump i 100 support him i don't know how he's getting
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:09.040]  anything done under under the type of of pressure and then just the lies in the media yeah the constant
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.880]  attack on him and his family yeah and i'm tired of being a russian okay i'm not a rusky do you
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:20.800]  like my russian tech look at my russian look at my russian flag tie and my russian flag lapel
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.840]  and the russian kremlin office behind me wait a second what's that putin
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.520]  your oh two scoops i get three scoops today putin putin says i get three scoops of ice cream today
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:40.800]  wow good boy but is it no this it's ridiculous as to the pressure he is under but he's i think
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:47.440]  he's doing a wonderful job so far but the economy is really what what's most important to me besides
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.280]  the muslim invasion well here's the thing with the economy to me here's the thing with the economy
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:58.480]  to me if as long as as trump can get taxes lowered and keep bringing jobs in i think that the economy
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.800]  will somewhat take care of itself just because americans will have an income they'll have a working
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.880]  income they can start to buy some nice things that can help grow the economy they can you know now
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.400]  they can have a family they don't have to be worried about not being able to afford that so
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.520]  i think that's kind of the way that trump views economic recovery right now i'm not sure if he's
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.400]  looking so much at what strings he can pull as far as just bringing people jobs getting people back
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.960]  to work getting people good wages so that they can control their own destiny instead of looking
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.800]  at chuck schumer to be their daddy thank you so much for the call judy good points from judy
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:38.000]  let's go to dan who is also in florida go ahead dan cuck slayer what's up just slaying cucks like

[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.680]  key information i've been coming across lately and i'm having trouble getting it out there
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.880]  my youtube videos usually only get a couple hundred views and my twitter has been like crazy
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.880]  censored the past few weeks um so i just wanted to call in and get some of this info you got 30
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:23.040]  seconds um so first off obama's twitter account he has six he is following 629 000 people that um
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.720]  majority of them are locked accounts with only one to three followers one of them being the
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:35.200]  former president sounds like a communication network to me all right i'll tell you what let's
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.880]  hold let's hold dan over because i've noticed some weirdness about twitter too and there has

[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.400]  clear point as to what he's talking about but there's no doubt i mean twitter google they all
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.400]  are censoring their results that you see they want it they want to control the optics folks they

[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:31.200]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:39.680]  dot com studios it's alex jones this is what we have to avoid in the future here folks now
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.560]  this is a story that denise jesuja just shared but it's from 2011 claire mcaskill a democrat
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:55.760]  senator from missouri a witch of a woman hates men mcaskill to pay back taxes on plane senator
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:01.360]  claire mcaskill who has said that men just need to shut up said monday she will sell this is again
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:10.080]  from 2011 said she will sell her private plane and pay 287 000 in four years of back taxes so
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.600]  it's nice that this democrat senators has that lucrative cash just sitting around just just
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:21.440]  chilling just sitting around senator mcaskill just she just got this cash ready to go from
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:27.120]  back taxes just like most these democrats and the story goes on and it talks about this plane
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:32.000]  and how they avoided taxes on this plane and then all the money that was shelled out by the
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.760]  state of missouri for her to go on these vacations to the tune of more than half a million dollars
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:42.400]  so she really owes the state of missouri more than just those back taxes but then of course
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:47.680]  leave it to claire mcaskill to blame her husband it was all her husband's fault she wanted nothing
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:54.320]  to do with it she didn't know what was going on and then she convinced her husband i have convinced
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:00.240]  my husband to sell the damn plane mcaskill said after telling him to shut up probably i will
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:05.280]  never step plate on it somebody here's the story guys this happened in 2011 claire mcaskill has
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:15.600]  been elected again she has been elected since this story broke folks it's time to stop electing
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:25.520]  crooked politicians okay it's time to stop it is time to hold yourself accountable as a member
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:31.600]  of the voting community of this republic how can you vote for claire mcaskill again
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:40.960]  how can you vote for paul ryan how can you vote i mean the maxine waters chuck schumer i mean the
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:47.520]  list goes on and on and on i am just hoping i'm praying every night that in 2018 america wakes up
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.800]  and we finally make congress great again and we do the right thing in this election just like we
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:23:01.200]  did electing trump instead of this wicked witch of the west hillary clinton let's let dan dan
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:05.600]  finish your point on obama twitter weirdness and uh we got to get to some more calls go ahead dan
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:15.360]  sure well so i was looking at obama's twitter account he followed 629 000 people and the majority
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:23.120]  of them are random locked accounts that you can't view publicly that only have like one two or three
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:30.640]  followers one of them being obama i just it seems like some sort of uh deep state communication
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:38.080]  network also um you were talking about the paid protesters earlier uh through my research i found
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.000]  that most of these uh them from a group called fund for the public interest one of the heads of this
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.920]  group is a man named adam ross fowl which is a very interesting last name right anyway his only
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:56.320]  other job was working for an art gallery and the owner of that art gallery sits on a political board
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:02.400]  with none other than chuckie crocodile pierce schumer but we have seen dining and drinking on
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:08.800]  multiple occasions recently with alex soro oh yeah soros is uh big time hamming it up with
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:14.080]  these big big democrats up there uh was it the same type of art that tony podesta's into
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.800]  i didn't look that far into it but that that's actually that i am gonna look into that now
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:25.440]  yeah absolutely and then uh and then tweet it at me i mean you can be within whatever art you want
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.440]  tony podesta i don't care if you're into art with young children's hands is hide behind their backs
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:34.800]  i mean that's tony podesta's art choice i mean you know he has every right to uh have weird art
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.880]  that depicts children being in weird torturous positions that's what tony podesta likes not
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.840]  me that's john podesta's brother so thank you for the call dan look into that and uh tweet that at me
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.360]  let's go out to uh o brian in maryland go ahead o brian
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:57.920]  yeah hello um for those who who know uh i called in here back in the third of june
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:03.040]  i did leave a point about doc kept going out here to clinton i told everybody to pretty much
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:11.360]  no wait until like second or third term because if he goes after these guys they kind of might
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:17.760]  actually have to panic and start blocking them whenever he can i think i hear the point you're
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:25.200]  making and that's well i would say that we need to give trump four years to before we really fully
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:32.560]  judge his presidency i'm not sure we have a good connection so let's go ahead and move on from
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.960]  o brian i think i think that's what he was saying i'm not sure if i understood what he was saying
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.280]  but that's kind of how i feel i mean when i look at things that trump does it i don't
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.720]  necessarily uh agree with or or or you're not even that it's more stuff that you sit here and you say
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.840]  why isn't trump doing that why hasn't trump done that and i say well there's still time you know
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.880]  there still could be inner workings going on so for for those type of issues i i just i just want
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.840]  to wait it out and we'll see when trump's done being president what he did or did not do and then
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.680]  choose to scrutinize that but right now uh uniting america behind trump is what is best for this
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:15.520]  country let's go to john in wisconsin go ahead john yeah how you doing doing fine hey listen um
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:23.920]  took each humor i saw on uh either fox or one of the other cable news outlets they had a
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:30.640]  like a billboard set up with all the usual uh democratic mohawk pieces including hillary
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:39.920]  which is chuck schumer um folk harness you know them about the new democratic party
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.680]  and what they're going to be doing here's the thing here here's the thing about the democrats
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:52.720]  that you have to understand um especially true for their constituents they don't live in reality
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:59.840]  so the democrats are already dead the democrat party is already dead they will not have any
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.480]  more victories now whether they try to reinvent themselves or a new party emerges is what we'll
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:12.320]  have to wait and find out but the democrats as a party are dead they're 3.3 million in debt
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.480]  the dnc is being sued for fraud most democrats that have a a good head on their shoulder can
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.960]  now see how burning got screwed see how the dnc was rigged and see how corrupt everything involved
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:29.760]  was so the democrats are dead they can deny they're dead their constituents can deny they're dead
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:39.600]  but they're dead is that all john no i was gonna comment too i was going through the page uh this
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:50.320]  morning in the article about the uh change in the uh uh the way they're gonna be holding the uh the um

[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.880]  about the picture of sean spicer with his lapel pin upside down uh it does appear that whatever
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:15.440]  picture you were talking about and the report probably do not correlate it was most likely a
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.640]  picture that was taken from some other date that we use on the story and uh the pin was probably
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.920]  just most likely upside down just by chance and not on purpose uh so just wanted to address that
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:33.280]  now let's go back out to the phone lines let's go to wild in wisconsin hey oh and uh hey alexa
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:42.480]  i was just wondering oh would your opinion on uh trump's uncle what uncle i don't even know
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:49.120]  the one that was with tesla or whatever the mit professor yes the one who worked with tesla
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:57.760]  he got all the tesla's trunks of uh inventions afterward he has so all right here's the deal
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:04.320]  here's the deal i i i i i are you are you trying to take me down the rabbit hole with this guy oh no
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:10.960]  no if i was going to take you down the rabbit hole i tell you well all i will say is i i don't
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:16.240]  really i i can't really comment on trump's uncle much uh but what i will say is the connection to
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.520]  tesla is very funny um in a good way i think it's cool that there was that connection and then what
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:27.200]  you just mentioned about his inventions and if you know donald trump is a time traveler as people
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.080]  like to rumor on the internet or perhaps baron trump is a time traveler here's here's all i say
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:37.440]  it's it's run it's funny it's it's fun you know people are following it but i will tell you have
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:42.240]  you heard of the book baron trump's magical mystery adventures with his dog bulger have you heard of
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:50.560]  this yes yes yes i think it's more uh coincidences you know you look for 777 you'll find it everywhere
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.840]  so it is odd though i mean what are the odds um it's me magic and i will tell you i've actually
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:02.960]  ordered a copy of that book it was published in 1889 it was very hard to get a hand on this book
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:09.280]  folks it was very hard the author is ingers ingersoul lockwood he printed a series of four books
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.360]  about baron trump's magical mystery adventures there's a meme on the internet about baron trump
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:22.640]  being a time traveler and then he published a book in 1896 called the last president and in that
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:30.000]  book he hints to a major cruise liner ship crashing into an iceberg something that had never happened
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.920]  in history and he mentions the first victims of leftist communist riding in the streets
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:43.520]  being against a hotel on fifth avenue in new york that's trump hotel and again this was
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:52.080]  published in 1896 so pretty amazing coincidences by this author ingersoul lockwood that i actually
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.880]  enjoy sci-fi fantasy writing i actually enjoyed his writing so it was amazing he writes about this
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:01.600]  guy baron trump uh but yeah that's pretty much all i know about that stuff is there anything else you
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:08.240]  wanted to say um well i think it's important that he should address it because it's like
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.680]  connected to the energy crisis the health care we're living in tesla's world uh the polyphase
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.880]  generator well yeah yeah i mean necola tesla created the the modern day electrical generators
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:29.440]  and grid yes uh radio transmission rf signals x ray all tesla stuff and um you know i i think
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:35.920]  it's pretty much the panacea because free energy unlimited energy which was tesla's magnum opus
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.720]  um would pretty much knock down the globalist globalist they wouldn't you know you'd hit
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:51.040]  him in every wallet well we know that they've been suppressing you know medical breakthroughs
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:56.880]  energy breakthroughs uh that's just what happens when you have so much power to control the market
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:01.760]  and to stop anything from infiltrating it um but trump said in his inaugural address that we're
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.040]  gonna we're gonna find these things out together we're gonna find the mysteries of the universe
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.320]  together so um you know maybe he is gonna come through on that in the first four years of his
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.640]  presidency i was told in the break that he said on the alex shown show when he came on to give him
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.640]  a year um so we're about halfway there uh so so we'll continue to monitor that but yeah his
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.240]  uncle's relation to tesla has has created a lot of meme magic and it's introduced me magically to
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:30.400]  an author i ended up enjoying from the late 1800 so thank you for that call wild from
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:40.080]  wisconsin let's go to derrick in nebraska all right derrick you are up go ahead derrick taking my call
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:45.120]  i just want to thank you but uh you and uh alex and everyone i know from yours do you guys are
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.040]  the tip of the spear for sure but i just want to go and kind of talk about what you know the
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.640]  trump agenda everybody seems to be criticizing him especially on the right oh he's not getting
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:57.600]  nothing done he's not getting nothing done i actually worked on capitol hill uh and i actually
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:03.040]  just left a couple months ago but i worked there and uh it's not just trump versus the democrat
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:08.960]  it's trump versus absolutely almost everyone in an entire swamp of dc and i mean the fact that he's
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.160]  going against tens of thousands of people 100 senators who almost all of them hate him and 435
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.000]  congressmen that are against him i think it's remarkable what he's done so well i hear what
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.440]  you're saying i hear what you're saying we need to make congress grade again in 2018 and it's
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:29.200]  going to be up to us to stop the obstructionists or the democrats by electing the right people in
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.240]  2018 that want to get behind trump's agenda uh get behind the make america great again movement
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:39.200]  that doesn't mean they have to want to uh see i would trump on everything but at least the america
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:44.960]  first policy that would be nice yeah absolutely i mean it's all of these politicians or at least
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.440]  most of them it's they don't really want america to speak they don't want to pass tax reform they
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.760]  don't want to clearly repeal obamacare you know or there's a dozen other things or they could be
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:57.520]  corrupt and they're worried for their own you know political future or perhaps they're just a
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:01.920]  dead duck politician and they don't think they can get reelected so they're worried about that you
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.080]  know there's all different angles but but but you're definitely right and you know the weird
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:15.040]  thing of it is i don't know if you've been following uh the dr shiva aya du re versus um deal in the
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.200]  republican primaries in massachusetts i don't know if you've been following that and some of the weird
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:25.440] ness that's been going on with the media there uh photoshop pictures just weird stuff and what
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:30.320]  dr shiva is saying he thinks he's dealing with the swamp that a lot of other people haven't
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:36.000]  realized yet that the republicans are going to foist up people for senate and for congress in
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.520]  2018 that are fake trumpers to get them elected but then once they get in there'll be nothing
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:46.080]  but obstructionist so that's something that we got to keep our eye on too so uh good points derrick
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:52.000]  thank you for the call let's go to mckenzie in south carolina all right mckenzie go ahead hello
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  yep oh hello well what i was originally want to come up one of the first things was this whole
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.680]  roger stone boros bull and i i haven't really heard about whether he has sued him yet i was
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:09.520]  wondering is he gonna sue him yet or is he just gonna let it flow until something else happens
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:15.680]  with that you know we i'm sure roger will be on this week to address that uh i think that they
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.880]  had sued him i you know i don't know what what litigation processes that they were currently
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.560]  in the you know undergoing in order to get that through but my guess is that they will not send
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.600]  it they will not end up suing him because they don't want him to testify in court
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:39.520]  oh and then another thing i wanted to address was the whole millennials why do we why do they
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:46.800]  happen to come hello yeah finish your point five seconds oh yeah millennials comes because they
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.120]  think that the lgbd community is going to get denigrated by trump when that's not the king
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.320]  he just wants prosperity yeah more lies more lies from the media that's all the media does from
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.320]  msnbc to cnn as most of you already know i am a voracious consumer of news and information
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:07.360]  and in the last four or five years doing more more research i came across the fact that the
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:13.360]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:19.600]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:25.600]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:32.960]  concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.080]  and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist

[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.800]  they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.640]  their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:16.160]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:22.720]  endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:29.680]  sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:36.080]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:42.960]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:50.800]  way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies

[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:28.480]  stories i'm going to mention here before we close out the callers callers please make it quick get
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:34.880]  to your points here's a story in chicago women worried about violence join gun club and it tells
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:42.080]  a very powerful story about 71 year old marietta crowder she has rheumatoid arthritis and she lives
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:49.040]  in chicago and she is now taking gun training to learn how to use a firearm to protect herself
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:55.920]  and i salute that that is the answer um to gun violence is protecting yourself with a gun and
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.480]  and that's just been proven time and time again that's why you call a police officer when you're
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:07.680]  in trouble do nothing congress reaches 200 days without with obama care and massive tax is still
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:13.200]  in place yes that's the do nothing congress that's the obstructionist congress led by paul ryan led
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:19.440]  by chuck schumer this is the swamp these are the people that have to go they promise that they would
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.960]  repeal obama care they ran on that for seven years they lied they did nothing new hampshire
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:31.360]  democrats ban mainstream media from maxine waters appearance i love this story the irony is so rich
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:37.920]  in this you could cut it with a dull knife maxine waters literally complains every day the democrats
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:43.200]  complain every day when the mainstream media isn't allowed into their little press gaggles
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:48.160]  or that shan spicer doesn't invite everybody on for a video uh press briefing oh but here's the
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:53.760]  new hampshire democrats banning media from maxine waters appearance shocking wondering what they
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:50:00.960]  were trying to hide let's go to jessie in virginia go ahead jessie oh they're so good oh they're so
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:07.040]  sweet what's up oh and how you doing i can't believe that uh this is the final segment of the show
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:12.240]  just two hours in time flies by i could be on for hours with y'all yeah it does fly man hey i was
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:16.800]  just telling me and i know it's kind of far fetched it's far out but hey man alex jones 2024
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.120]  2024 baby 2024 is there not anybody else that's talking about politics about the news about the
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:30.160]  world about countries who knows more about this world that's pro all of us who want the trump
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.920]  agenda who wants prosperity and alex jones here here here's the thing here's the thing i hear
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:41.440]  what you're saying i hear you're saying i look if alex is it i mean i i you know alex doesn't
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.920]  want to be a politician i don't blame him okay i wouldn't want to be a politician and you gotta
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:53.520]  understand that even though trump has been under such scorn such scrutiny such attack folks i mean
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:58.400]  even myself i mean i'm not i'm not sitting here acting like i'm some sort of uh of a bad guy but
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.880]  i mean my god i can only imagine the attacks that would be coming against me if i was to
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:07.200]  run for any office i would want nothing to do with that and they would be bad i mean so it's
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.080]  just like you know is it worth it do you really want to deal with that and i i don't know i don't
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:16.560]  think alex does i don't blame him and i think he's more effective uh right here in austin texas on
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:22.000]  the alex jones show but i don't know alex jones 2024 that's what jessie and virginia says let's go
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:30.960]  to greg in missouri go ahead greg hey owen thanks for taking the call and i gotta say you i gotta
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:37.120]  talk about this spicer to scaromucci transition i think it's laughable that he's being portrayed
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:43.200]  as an outsider he's given money to the obama to clinton endorse jeb bush he's been rubbing elbows
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.280]  with all kinds of uh big time players of his go look at the conferences he hosted as the head of
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:52.880]  skybridge capital and he did the same info wars not she's specifically on but roger stone did the
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:58.000]  same thing with uh get with tone and mnuchin said that they would be the goldman tax bankers that
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.960]  would follow donald trump's orders and i'm just wondering oh no i hear what you're saying i'll
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:08.560]  go along with that train of thought and he also was on fox news in 2015 bashing donald trump i
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:17.280]  believe he called him a con man um the way i see it though is if if these guys really want to play
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:22.960]  ball and they really want to be on trump's team and he believes that then i think that they at
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:27.360]  least deserve a chance now maybe he could end up being another member of the swamp maybe not uh
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:33.280]  but i think the reason that trump put him in there is because he views him as maybe he's been rubbing
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.280]  elbows with these guys but you know he's never really been a total member of the swamp i don't
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:41.600]  know i'm just playing devil's advocate here uh but i hear what you're saying you raise good points
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:45.920]  but if he's on our team now i think that that's that's a winning equation final final comment
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.320]  greg it's a benefit of doubt and i think it's laughable and you guys do at least be honest
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:54.480]  about these people instead of trying to portray them as something they're not that's that's it and
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:00.080]  what do you think scaramucci is going to do well i think the scaramucci's probably got very much in
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:06.400]  line of a policy and agenda that represents what his predecessors represented much like how
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:12.480]  the tax policies that cone and mnuchin a lot of the domestic uh economic policies that not regarding
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:17.120]  trade deals as far as the tax deals with who gets what kind of taxes that falls in here here's the
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:21.840]  thing he's not in there for policy he's not in there because of he has any agenda he is in there
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:28.240]  to dictate communication between the white house and the press dictate a news cycle that is his job
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:32.880]  so that is what trump put him in there for we'll see if he ends up going towards obama policies
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.800]  are not um but they're fair points greg i'm not ignoring what you're saying um i'm just more along
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:42.080]  the lines of a will see but i know what you're saying uh what you're saying i'm not discounting
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:49.520]  that let's go to des final caller of the day go ahead des hey i went first off sharp tie i'm calling
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:56.560]  in today to talk about the rise of akathisia akathisia being a neuropsychiatric uh side effect
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.840]  due to increasing lithium and i just want to bring people's attention to it and say you know what is
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:06.640]  it something they're putting in the water we know through lithium they're spraying lithium in the air
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:13.680]  i believe it's part of the aerosol uh geo climate change thing or um geoengineering i believe lithium
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:20.320]  is part of that well we know lithium causes akathisia it's so prevalent now they're starting to advertise
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:26.960]  akathisia related tv commercials so it's just another tool in the control matrix and it's
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.080]  something i think people should be aware of maybe go out buy eco science wait a second oh wait a
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:37.440]  second des didn't you hear chuck schumer earlier chuck schumer he's got your back bro does he

[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.040]  man he's gonna keep them under control oh sure well i'd like to see that you know that's the epidemic
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:52.240]  we're facing here everyone they're off the label writing psychotropic medicines for every second wait
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:59.920]  a second sir sir des des are you saying you don't trust chuck schumer i don't think i do no i don't
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:06.880]  trust big pharma i don't trust you don't trust big pharma come on des i the side effects are not
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:13.920]  that bad death blindness geon beret i mean come on oh sure yeah i'd like to spend a week in the icu
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:20.400]  yeah what's what's the big deal is paid for by obama care what it's bad you know and it just
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:25.040]  makes you wonder was something like the flint incident was that you know engineered is that a
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:29.920]  control grid kind of takeover you know what thank you for that call i'm glad we're gonna end with
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:37.200]  that speaking of engineered speaking of controlled takeover an anonymous user posted on a website
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:46.080]  name swordfish saying that he has damning evidence of hollywood pedophiles music music industry
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:52.640]  pedophiles washington dc pedophiles and apparently he this anonymous white hat hacker is set to release
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:59.040]  this evidence in the next 24 hours against these industries if if none of his four demands are met
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.040]  none of this person's four demands are going to be met everybody is sending this to me on twitter
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:08.800]  everybody who's connected into the you know the reddits and the four chans and and some of those
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:14.320]  websites are all talking about this user who put this on pull this was the first thing that came
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.720]  to my mind because you know i can't really report on this stuff there's not much there uh at least
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:25.200]  for me to report on factually but what came to my head when i started reading this and when i started
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:30.960]  to see the response was first of all why wouldn't you just release that stuff to begin with and then
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.040]  this person says he can't yet he wants to be controlled he wants to have it go out the right
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.280]  way or whatever but my train of thought took me to different direction because of course everybody
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:43.360]  sees this everybody wants it to be true they want these people to be exposed they want this whole
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:49.520]  pizza gate pedo gate thing to come to a conclusion and they want to see some justice but i thought
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:54.800]  of a different angle because this this again it's an anonymous user on a website claiming they have
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:00.240]  this and says that they're going to docks a bunch of celebrities they're going to put out a bunch
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:04.560]  of personal and private information on these celebrities so my mind actually went in a different
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:12.640]  direction watch out for a false flag here folks watch out for a false flag beware of somebody
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:18.400]  doxing a bunch of celebrities doxing a bunch of politicians claiming it's the alt right
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:23.920]  claiming it's free press claiming they're trying to stop pedophiles and then here comes big old
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:28.000]  government to take control of the internet because all these celebrities and all these
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.080]  politicians just got doxed and it was nothing more than a false flag so keep your ears pinned back
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:39.040]  folks we've got a war going on right now for the future of this country we've got a war going on for
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:46.400]  truth and it's up to you to make sure that we are victorious and we are right now you stay classy
