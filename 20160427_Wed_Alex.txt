[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[00:13.000 --> 00:24.000]  The boys tell how about your fellow and left his living in a cheap hotel
[00:24.000 --> 00:33.000]  Desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold, saw the story and we're told
[00:33.000 --> 00:44.000]  I don't need your prayers, it's true, save a few, he only did what he had to do
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  And now Merle Haggard has died, and now he's grown old
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  I was listening to Merle Haggard routinely, every week, he's on my playlist but I've been listening to a lot of Merle Haggard lately
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  He's gone like everybody else, who enters this world will one day die
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  Death is the great equalizer
[01:10.000 --> 01:17.000]  Think about that, I know I do, living each day as if it could be your last
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  That was a big report out in the Guardian a few days ago that I meant to cover
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  In fact, will you guys repull that for me, thank you
[01:24.000 --> 01:33.000]  Asking why are people so deathly bored in all the different statistics and measurement systems that governments have in the West
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  And it's because the human population is being removed from its natural environment
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  And an artificial environment is being built to dehumanize us and to blind us
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  And that is the social engineer's own admission
[01:52.000 --> 02:02.000]  The modern world has a lot of advances and a lot of positive things about it but also has a lot of side effects that the globalists themselves have been exacerbating
[02:02.000 --> 02:13.000]  And building whole economies of scale around them
[02:13.000 --> 02:23.000]  And there is a spectator like mindset that has been inculcated into people
[02:23.000 --> 02:37.000]  Where they don't have any basic drive, any basic push for innovation
[02:37.000 --> 02:52.000]  They think of it as work and I've often likened that to thinking of breathing as something horrible you're forced to do because there's a labor to it
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  You look at the extreme examples of that, people that weigh over a thousand pounds and can never get out of their bed
[02:59.000 --> 03:11.000]  That live cloistered in tiny apartments with their bodies bulk filling up a third of the space
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  Now that's an extreme example but that's where society and humanity is going
[03:18.000 --> 03:27.000]  And we're taught all these false systems of education and false systems of supposed intelligence
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  When every culture knew that real intelligence sprung forth obviously from native genetics
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  But also from the environment and the test and the trials that one was put through
[03:40.000 --> 03:54.000]  And so every culture would put their young and others through test and through trials of adversity to unlock their potential
[03:54.000 --> 04:05.000]  You look at the modern world, the nanny state, it's all about never allowing anyone to have a basic right of passage
[04:05.000 --> 04:24.000]  To move up the hierarchy of the human experience and to unlock the data, the knowledge stores that are held in your compressed race memory
[04:24.000 --> 04:36.000]  That the media and the scientists called instincts but know full well is only the surface of a very deep ocean of knowledge
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  I know how to defeat the new world order, they know how to suppress humanity
[04:41.000 --> 04:53.000]  What I'm here to do is reverse that, the question is do you really want to live, do you really want to be alive, do you really want to transcend tyranny
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  I'm Alex Jones, big broadcast lined up, stay with us
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  But it doesn't look like Ted Cruz who called a basketball hoop, a basketball ring while in the Hoosier state
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  Or John Kasich who eats his pizza with a fork will be dropping out anytime soon
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  In fact they've now teamed up to try and take down the Donald
[05:38.000 --> 05:45.000]  But here's more bad news for them, Trump has passed Romney in the popular vote total and is likely to break the GOP record
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  More people are jumping parties to the Republican party to vote for Donald Trump
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  Ted, just listen to Adrian
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  You can't win!
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  Milk thistle, phobic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  Deep cleanse doesn't hold back
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  We use decades old scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing
[06:36.000 --> 06:43.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietaries by Jurex herbal processing technique
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  And we still bring it to you at the best price out there
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  Find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  Visit infowarslife.com
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  That's infowarslife.com
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  Or call 888-253-3139
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  Giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  Sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  They had drums of their own, air raid sirens
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  But in the 21st century there were silent weapons for quiet war
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  Pathetogens added to the food and water
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  And to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  To create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[07:56.000 --> 08:14.000]  It starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald J. Trump swept five states in almost every county
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  Ted Cruz last time I heard only got two delegates
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  And so they are on Fox News and singing and declaring his victory
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  And they have the entire Republican leadership
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  Like a bunch of demonic parrots hopping around repeating the same things
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  Over and over again
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  That they are not even going to give him the nomination if he gets the 1238
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  Or that they will create a third party to scully things
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  And hand it to Hillary Autumn Clinton
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  If you ever had any doubt about what an incredible group of organized criminals
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  The Republican leadership is, you now have another stunning example
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  Now, according to the Republican Party's own rules
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  They rewrote in the 1976 that is just crooked as a dog's back leg
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  That they never tried to implement
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  But even according to their crooked rules
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  Ted Cruz is now eliminated completely
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  Infowars.com has the Gateway Pundit article that shows the party rules
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  And breaks down the fact it's also up on DrudgeReport.com
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  And we're going to be breaking down the latest developments on that front today
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  We also have the Trump insider Roger Stone joining us in the third hour
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  David Knight hosts the fourth hour
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  And Matt Bracken, enemies foreign and domestic
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  Will be joining us with his thesis and analysis
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  Dealing with the fact that these millions of Muslims coming in
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Upwards of 80% being military aged men who had been failed invaders of Syria
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  Out of Saudi Arabia and other nations
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  Are coming here to plan a massive sneak attack
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  Sleeper cell attack on the lines and scale of the Tet Offensive in Vietnam
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  And he's a long-serving Navy SEAL going back to the 1980s
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  And I'm not criticizing any of the Navy SEALs
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  But he wasn't just a door kicker, but a higher level planner, a really smart guy
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  And I'm going to go over some of his background
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  As a constitutionalist, he's going to be joining us Matt Bracken
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  Highly recommended from Stuart Rhodes and others at Oathkeepers
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  He's going to be popping in to break down the parable of the snake with us today
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  And that is in the second hour
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  We'll definitely want to stay with us for that
[11:13.000 --> 11:20.000]  We're also going to get into an article he wrote, Burning Down the House in 2016
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  So we're going to be covering that today
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  That said, there is another big false artificial synthetic foe
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  Controversy being pushed right now
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  And that that is that Donald Trump hates women
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  And they really have seized on this, how dare him
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  And oh my gosh, it's a hate crime
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  He said Hillary would get 5% of the vote
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  If she was like the other 14 people that ran for the Republican nomination
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  The average was, they were getting 2% to 5% many of them
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  That if she wasn't a woman, she's so untalented, so boring, so goofy
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  Also so corrupt that she wouldn't get 5% of the vote
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  I absolutely agree with that astute statement
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  I mean, Jeb Bush could never get about 5%, 6%
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  They're establishment candidates
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  I think that's the most dead on statement I've heard from Trump in a long time
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  Of a lot of dead on statements, I mean, that is dead on
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  It's a gimmick that she's a woman
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  But Barack Obama, he's a pretty good speaker, pretty good teleprompter reader
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  Goes on a lot of shows, makes jokes and stuff
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  I mean, he's a lot easier to watch than Hillary
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  And I'm sick of looking at it
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  But how about the argument that we just don't want to see this evil witch for 4 to 8 years
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  I mean, get out of our lives and all your robot talking where
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  Hello, I'm Hillary Clinton, just staring under teleprompters
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  But the way they seize on all language now is hurtful and bad
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  Of course, it's a gimmick that she's a woman
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  They admit that's the gimmick
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  And then next, it'll be a gay president
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  And then it'll be a albino president
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  And then it'll be a foreign president
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  It's total gimmick
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Like, oh, the new iPad's coming out
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  It's never been this color before
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  It's only three times what the last version is
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  It's just all gimmicks
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  Gimmick after gimmick
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  So let's play this clip
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  Trump came out and said if Hillary Clinton were a man
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  She would get less than 5% of the vote
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  And remember, this is in his victory speech last night
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  As he gets ready to go after Hillary
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  And as he says, look, I'm the guy
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  I have the majority of the delegates
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  I'm gonna get the 12, 38
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  Game over
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  He's going to just totally sweep now out in the West
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  In other areas
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  Roger Stone's coming on, he's very, very confident
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  The question is, will they try to assassinate Trump
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  Or will they roll out a bunch of fake scandals
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  That won't actually bring him down with the public
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  But will create enough of a doubt
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  When the convention starts
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  In the public's mind to make it okay
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  For some people to accept the Republicans coming out
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  And saying, he's so evil, he's so bad with this new scandal
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  We're just going to not allow him to have any of the delegates
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  The superdelegates are gonna block that
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  Violating their own crooked rules that themselves are a fraud
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  And steal the election from Trump
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  Do they have the hoodspot
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  The arrogance
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  The hubris
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  Or is it the fear
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  To do something so reckless and dirty
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  We don't lose either way
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  They show themselves in openly cancel elections
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  And install people or have a fake synthetic plastic race
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  It'll just devastate the power structure that much worse
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  But if Donald Trump gets in
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  We've got to totally stay on him
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  To really carry out the nationalist, constitutionalist
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  Pro-American programs
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  That will actually make this country roar
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  Back to just amazing prominence
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  So that's a big question
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  But here is Trump in part of his victory speech last night
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  As he dominated five states
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  More than he's even dominated any previous states
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  Including New York, just a landslide
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  A landslide
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  That should be the headline today
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  A landslide
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  But really that hasn't been out there
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  There's a headline up on Drudge
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  We obviously want to follow this and have our writers cover it
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  AP reporting
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  Trump's big speech test his foreign policy and style
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  Donald Trump's highly anticipated foreign policy speech today
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  The 27th
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  Will test whether the Republican presidential frontrunner
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  Knows
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  For his raucous rallies and eyebrow raising statements
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  Can present a more presidential persona
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  As he works to unite the GOP establishment behind him
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  Trump is expected to outline a vision for U.S. foreign policy
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  That focuses on rebuilding alliances
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  Charting a new course with Russia and Iran
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  And tackling the threat posed by the Islamic State
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  According to
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  Walled Ferris, one of the Republican frontrunners
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  Policy advisors
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  And it goes on from there
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  And the big debate two weeks ago internally inside
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  Planet Trump headquarters in New York
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  Was does he do this speech without a teleprompter
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  Or without notes
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  And reportedly Trump overruled
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  Some of his new advisors
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  And his older advisors
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  And said I'm going teleprompter free
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  Which is what I know
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  Roger Stone advised him that day in New York to do
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  So you've got
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  Paul Manfort, you've got the other fellow that submitted them
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  All the trouble and stuff they've been going after him
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  And then of course you've got Stone
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  But I mean you can't say anybody's the main advisor to Trump
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  Trump does everything's his best
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  Which is very refreshing
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  But he also says some things I disagree with
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.000]  Like the iPhone business and the rest of it
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  Let's go ahead and play the clip
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  Well I think the only card she has is the woman's card
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  She's got nothing else going
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  And frankly if Hillary Clinton were a man
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  The only thing she's got going is the woman's card
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  And the beautiful thing is women don't like her
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  Okay
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  And look how well I did with women tonight
[17:57.000 --> 17:58.000]  Okay
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  That is such an incredibly true statement from end to end
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  Women don't like her
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  She's not doing very well in national polls
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  When you really talk to women across the board
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  And she's not doing well with black Americans
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  She's not doing well with wealthy liberals
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Who are pro-america, that's been in politico
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  There's a whole class of those folks that are entrepreneurial
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  She's just not doing well anywhere
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Hispanics voted for him in a whole bunch of primaries
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  Against the other Republicans
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  48, 52% you name it, those are the numbers
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  Depending on the state, I mean
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  That was back when there were 6 or 7 candidates in
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  In places like Nevada
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  They've got a big problem
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  A big problem
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  And the South like scene
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  Remember Cruz showing his miscalculation
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  Going, I mean the ultimate Yankee from Canada
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  I guess that's a beyond Yankee
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  I love Canadians by the way, it's just that
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  It is weird to have this guy that rode into town on a moose
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  You know
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  He's been shipped from Cuba or wherever he came from
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  And he's running around
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Saying, yeah we don't like those New Yorkers
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  And their values up there
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  You mean all the globalists that have come in
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  And taken over New York and have high taxes
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  On the rest of the New Yorkers feeding on them
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  You mean those people?
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.000]  Oh by the way, those people voted for Cruz
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  The only places he won were in the most
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  Establishment blue blood areas of New York City
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  So Cruz got the New Yorkers
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  That he was claiming Trump was with
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  And Trump got everybody else
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  So this miscalculation that Hispanics
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  Or African Americans
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  Or women aren't going to go for Trump
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  Is a load of moosemenor
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Directly from the
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  Establishment Republican Democratic Party
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  And then regurgitated back out
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  After he had a full meal of it
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  Which he craves Ted Cruz
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  Yes, it's true folks
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  Ted Cruz is a known connoisseur of moosemenor
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  Okay, I'm going to stop the jokes
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  We're going to get serious on the other side
[19:59.000 --> 20:26.000]  Let's get serious on the other side
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  Is there a difference in
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  When your life depends on it
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.000]  Trust no other
[20:59.000 --> 21:26.000]  So you want to be sure it's
[21:26.000 --> 21:33.000]  In these days of terrorist attacks
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  Natural disasters or even a future collapse
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  You need to be medically prepared
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  To keep your family safe
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomenbloom.net

[23:21.000 --> 23:49.000]  Go to store.doomenbloom.net
[23:49.000 --> 23:59.000]  Go to store.doomenbloom.net
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  Yeah, and the renegades aren't a bunch of
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  Red flag waving trendies
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  Worshiping Bernie Sanders
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Rothschilds or Rockefellers on record
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  Cooked up communism
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  Took down Russia and installed that nightmare
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  And we owe Russia an apology
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  For allowing our elites to use our money
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  And our treasure to do that
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  Then Russia was set up as this engine
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  Of absolute evil along with communist China
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  That's still operating
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  To run around and murder and enslave
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  Their own people and their neighbors
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  That's how the globalists operate
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  The globalists also wound up and created
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Adolf Hitler
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  Now they know there's massive populist
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Movements forming around the world
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  And they're doing everything they can
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  To try to stop them
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  Because once sovereign nations fall
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  And countries are brought under deep debt
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  To the globalist, terms of surrender
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  And capitulation can be dictated
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  Directly to those governments
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  What we are seeing is 21st century warfare
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  Speaking of warfare coming up
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  Amazing headline
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  Russia starts trial of new
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  Electromagnetic Warfare System
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  Think Tank outlines possible scenarios
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  For Russian collapse
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  We're going to get to both these articles
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  Pro-ISIS group hacks Michigan church's website
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Threatens to enslave its women
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  We'll probably get a Gloria Steinem award
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  Only 53%
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  Only 53 police agencies participating
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  In national push for use of forced statistics
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  We're going to be going over that
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  That's just some of the news unfolding at that level
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  We're also going to get to an incredibly
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  Important story that ties into
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  What's happening with the economy
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  Report
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  DPS kept millions intended for
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Pensions
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  And that's the Detroit pension system
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  Turns out somebody's robbed it
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  Well, get ready for that to happen all over the country
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  It's already happening
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  And while we're busy fighting over
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  Transgendered bathrooms
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  The globalists are running away with the kitchen sink
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  And I'm going to tie that into this report
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  That's up on infowars.com
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  Believing in two genders is a hate crime
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  Now under police investigation
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  At U.S. Catholic college in Los Angeles
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  And they actually have the students saying
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  Yes, we want people arrested
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  Who have been heard saying
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  There's only two genders
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  For quote, denial of transgenderism
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  So you've heard of the French inquisition
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  The Spanish inquisition
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  You've heard Monty Python jump out and say
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  A Spanish inquisition
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  Well, it was no joke if you went through it
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  And got killed because you didn't
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  Toe the line with the local constabulary
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  A lot of people just used it as a system
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  To persecute whoever they wanted
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  It was a reign of terror that went on
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  For hundreds of years off and on
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  And really spurred the whole move
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  For the Protestant Reformation
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  And what Martin Luther did
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  Martin Luther King, the first Martin Luther, folks
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  If you're a new listener
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  And now with a straight face
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  The college and others are like
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  Yes, denial of transgenderism
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  Is illegal and a hate crime
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  So it's like denial of Christ
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  Is a hate crime will burn you at the stake
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  But they didn't just burn you at the stake
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  For denial of Christ
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  Your neighbor would say
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  I heard him claim he didn't love Mary
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  And if they didn't like you
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  They'd just take you, burn you at the stake
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  Torture you to death, kill you
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  And take your property
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  And of course it turned out the real Satanists
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  Most of the time were actually the torturers
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  Who loved every night raping and murdering
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  Women in their torture dungeons
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  And you know, all the rest of it
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  And this is just what any religion
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  Or any system can turn into
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  But now the Jesuits
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  It actually says in the article
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  Are the most quote liberal out there
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  Yes, that's very liberal
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  Arrest someone if they say there's two sexes
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Hey, what if they were wrong?
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  What if they said there was one sex
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  Or what if they were schizophrenic?
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  I mean, you're allowed to have your free speech, right?
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  No, no, no, arrest them, arrest them
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  No free speech
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  This is the mindset that we're dealing with
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  So, I'm sorry, I'm just mentioning articles coming up
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  I started getting into that one
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  It ties into this
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  Shocking undercover video up on infowars.com
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  Shows how
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  Target really feels about men in girls' bathrooms
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  And it's the communal open bathroom
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  Where, you know, it's a bunch of stalls
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  And boom, they say, go right on in
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  To the man who's clearly a man
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  Anti-Trump protesters
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  Pepper spray little girls in the face
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  A Paul Joseph Watson article
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  On infowars.com
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  And it shows what happened out in Anaheim
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  And they just won't let the pro-Trump people
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Protest in most of them are Hispanic, by the way
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  There's a Hispanic lady with her cute little kids
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  And other Hispanic people just run over
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  A big bully and sprays them
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Because you're not allowed to do that
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  I mean, Trump's a racist, so you deserve to be attacked
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  Because you're dehumanized
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  I mean, you can't say there's only two sexes, either
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  Because we're gonna have to arrest you
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  Because we're liberal
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  A Spanish Inquisition
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  Well, now it's the Tranny Inquisition
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  Chop it off or you'll be burned at the stake
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run
[29:53.000 --> 30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  Well, after the drubbing, Ted Cruz received
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  In five primaries last night
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  Gateway Pundit has declared it's official
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  Ted Cruz mathematically eliminated
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.000]  From GOP race
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  And they included a chart
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  But he did win one delegate in Rhode Island
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  But the Never Trump folks are seeing things a little differently
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.000]  They declared after last night's drubbing
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  No worry, the path to the nomination
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  Does not hinge on any of these outcomes
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  That's right, they're still planning on
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  Stealing the nomination with voterless elections
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  But it doesn't look like Ted Cruz
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.000]  Who called a basketball hoop a basketball ring
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  While in the Hoosier state
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  Or John Kasich who eats his pizza with a fork
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  Will be dropping out anytime soon
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  In fact, they've now teamed up to try and take down the Donald
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  But here's more bad news for them
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.000]  Trump has passed Romney in the popular vote total
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  And is likely to break the GOP record
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  More people are jumping parties to the Republican Party
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  To vote for Donald Trump
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  Just listen to Adrian

[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  they've got a ton of money there.
[32:32.000 --> 32:38.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.000]  or maximum potency.
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.000]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while,
[32:44.000 --> 32:49.000]  but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going,
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  goes right to the source.
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[33:22.000 --> 33:27.000]  This song is called The Summer of Rage by Shooter Jennings produced four years ago
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  for Infowars.com, for the police state film.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  And now, Roger Stone calls it The Summer of Rage coming up in Cleveland
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  if they try to deny Donald Trump the nomination.
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  The gas mask is the couture in The Summer of Rage.
[33:46.000 --> 33:55.000]  You know, I need to make a bigger deal out of Chuck Norris coming out
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  against geoengineering and saying there's a secret program to poison us
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  and the soil with aluminum to oxide.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  And then he links to mainstream articles basically admitting it
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  and whirled it daily three days ago.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  That's a big deal, because Chuck Norris is a smart guy, very influential,
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  who shows how mainstream has just gotten that it's Merle Haggard and Prince
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  and just everybody and lay people that aren't even listeners.
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  Talk about the Kim Trail flu and folks who know what's going on.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  And then they always play the childish game.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  They go, those are ice crystals.
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  Or if you are warning people about vaccines, they go, it's called science.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  And you take a little bit of what's bad and your body learns to beat it.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  And then you don't die.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  It's called science.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  And we're like, yeah, we know.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  Have you read the insert?
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  Do you know it's part of eugenics and they're adding things to it?
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  Like they add Trojan horses to your so-called iPhone or your smart car?
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  Yes, we know.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  You're against smart meters in your house.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  It's called air conditioning and heating.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  It's called science.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  It's why you don't freeze to death in the winter or boil to death in the summer.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  We go, we're not against thermostats.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  We don't want them that are designed as a government snooping probe
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  to control our temperature, gouge us and hijack all the data in the house
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  in an admitted global government plan, which is now admitted.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  There was an article on Monday and there's all these top science journals
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.000]  are coming out with heads of universities.
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  Head electrical engineers coming out and saying, it's actually true.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  Everything's wired together and it allows hackers in and governments
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  and it doesn't even work well and it's terrible and we need to do something about this.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  This is a horrible and everything's being tracked.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  The CIA director four years ago was in Wired Magazine saying,
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  all your appliances are going to have smart tech.
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  We're listening and watching you.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  These are all little, you know, in your face jokes.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  In your face jokes.
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  Of course, vaccine technology is real and works.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  And if there's something super deadly killing millions of people, I want it,
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  but I want a cost-benefit analysis and I don't want national security secrecy over it
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  in Europe and the United States with every major government caught jacking them
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  with sterilence and other compounds.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  Comparende.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  I want a thermostat I can control remotely, but I don't want it jacked in
[36:45.000 --> 36:55.000]  to a government imperial probe dried attached to the side of my house like a spider.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  This is a takeover.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  I was telling them about this during the break and they're like, seriously?
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  I was like, no, read Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[37:06.000 --> 37:14.000]  We're at a major Catholic university in California.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  Someone heard someone and then some faculty person said,
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  there's a bunch of articles on this newscast.
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  You name it.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  Someone said there was two genders and everyone's panicking in fear
[37:25.000 --> 37:32.000]  and they're running around calling for the arrest for whoever is a denier of transgenderism.
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  Just saying you don't say it exists is hurtful and the police came and yes,
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.000]  they want to arrest whoever in their weird interpretation of a hate law.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  This is the Spanish Inquisition.
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.000]  So imagine just running around like, we're looking for, we're not sure, help us.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  We saw someone chalked Trump 2016.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  It's a hate crime cell.
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  They had to call it 50 psychologists at one university alone.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  And we have the video where they see a Trump sign.
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  They see and they go, I'm hurting.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  It hurts.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  It hurts.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  And then the police come.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  Oh my God, it hurts.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  Remember the videos that the Veritas Project shot this year?
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  It was like eight different universities.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  And they go in as students and they go, I found a pocket constitution.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  These are places where people have been arrested.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  Students for handing them out are fined.
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  And they come and they go, I found this constitution.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's scary how I am.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  We had to do a master video of them all crying and freaking out.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  And the assistant team goes, oh my gosh, that's so scary.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Let me take that for you and throw it away.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  And of course, obviously the assistant dean goes,
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  this is just another one of these mentally ill people.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  But this is the psych warfare programming.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  They're putting them through.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  So they're processing it for them, preparing them.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  And it's like, oh, absolutely.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  It's mind control.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  Oh, you poor thing.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  Let me take care of that for you.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  Now there's the video.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  School official shred, oppressive, close quote, pocket constitutions.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  Here, see my memory said throw it away.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  I'm sorry it was worse than I said.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Here, I'll put it through a shredder.
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  The professor says about America's founding document.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  She goes, oh, oh, yes, I understand.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  Let me put that right in the shredder for you.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  We're going to call the police and find out who's doing.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  That's my sweetie.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Go watch the video.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  I mean, Yale.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  They're just like, yeah, let's get to you.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  We're not going to have costume parties.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  They're scary.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  I'm scared.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  Now listen, it's free speech.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  That's what liberal, I mean worse than Luke Skywalker saying,
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  no Darth Vader's not my father.
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  I mean, it's even worse acting too.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  Just, no, it's not true.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  It's a father.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  I saw his Trump 2016.
[39:54.000 --> 40:05.000]  Somebody say mother father.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition.
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  These people are so nuts.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  I kind of enjoy it at this point.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  These people are the freakest quits I've ever seen in my life.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  And it's got quotes from the TV pieces in here.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  Where they're like running around with the police going,
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  someone said it.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  We heard it.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Someone said there were two genders.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  These people are insane.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  Actually, I actually love this.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  I want more of it.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  I've never seen such unintentional comedy since Walker,
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  Texas Ranger.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  That is intentional, unintentional comedy.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  That's inside baseball, just so you know.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  All right, all right, all right.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  I'm sorry.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  It's really actually, I love it.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  They fired the professors that said,
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  no, people are allowed to have costume parties.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  They fired them.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  I feel so safe now.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  And they're taking everybody's pensions all over the world.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  I feel safe now.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  And they're building huge reeducation camps
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  and using the term reeducation camp in the official
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  US Army resettlement manual.
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  They're using Soviet brainwash terms.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  Wow.
[41:16.000 --> 41:22.000]  Oh man, I'm feeling really good right now.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  Believing, I'm going to try to read this article
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  and then get another news.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  Believing in two genders is a hate crime.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  That is close quote.
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.000]  Under police investigation at Catholic College.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  Guys, just whenever you want to play Spanish Inquisition,
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  just don't even ask me.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  Just play it every few minutes.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  Let's just have one right now.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  Can I have one more please?
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  That even looks like social justice warriors.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  The very looks on their faces.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  We're going to get you.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  Watch for every speech and never shut up.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  All right, sorry.
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  In fact, hit pause with the one that's crouching down that look.
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.000]  That's the crazed look of a like a 75, 80 IQ moron on a power
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  trip.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  That's that's exactly.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  Again, if you're a radio listener and we have a TV simulcast
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  info wars.com forward slash show.
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  Absolutely.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  That is they have what great actors they have really
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  encapsulated how authoritarian Zach when they're hopping around
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  on a power trip.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  I don't care what's out of control cops.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  I don't care what's out of control gang members,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  any racial group, religious group.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  Look at the looks that looks just like Isis with the same craze
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  looks they have in their eyes.
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  That's what whacked out lowbrows trying to dominate
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  everybody's discourse look like.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  If you want to see it.
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  In fact, let's hear John Cleese one more time please.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  By the way, John Cleese has come out and said it's like a new
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  Spanish Inquisition, the attack on free speech.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  So is Jerry Seinfeld shows this everybody else,
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  but see their older generation of real liberals.
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  They think it's just happened on accident and you know,
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  Atlantic Monthly says, oh, the mental illness of the coddled
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  people at universities.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  They're mentally ill.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  You made them that way.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  This was designed to get to this.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  I made films 18 years ago saying this was coming because
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  they were already doing it in certain areas of Sweden.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  John Cleese thinks political correctness is killing comedy.
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  It's going to kill more than that, brother.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  Now let's continue here.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  Let me get to the really good comedy,
[43:31.000 --> 43:32.000]  but this is not comedy.
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  This is deadly dangerous, but it is funny.
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  Believing in two genders is a hate crime.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  I'm sorry.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  But what's funny is it's now being investigated at the
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  Catholic College by the police.
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  The school.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  Now I'm going to read this as if it's serious.
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  I'm going to read this in my Ted Knight voice.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  Believing in two genders is a hate crime under police
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  investigation at Catholic College.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  The school was so spooked.
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.000]  It called the Los Angeles Police Department.
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  Now I'm going to read this in a British broadcaster voice.
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  That's even more serious.
[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  Excuse me.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.000]  Hold on.
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  Someone heard them say father or mother.
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.000]  He or she.
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  Police have been called as well.
[44:16.000 --> 44:22.000]  Believing in two genders is a hate crime under police
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  investigation at Catholic College.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  The school was so spooked.
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  It called the Los Angeles Police Department.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  It's uncommon at Jesuit universities these days for
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  someone to openly share a traditional Catholic viewpoint.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  When it happened at Loyola Marymount University in Los
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  Angeles, the school was so frightened.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  It called the Los Angeles Police Department.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  Both the police and the university's bias
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  incident response team are investigating.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  Thank God.
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.000]  They stated belief that only two genders exist,
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  male and female, as a hate crime.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  A Loyola alumni office employee discussed her views
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  on sexual orientation, which aligned with the
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  Roman Catholic Church, with students who were
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  hanging up posters on the subject on April 14th.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  Can you imagine a professor speaking with students
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  about their being two genders?
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  This is one of the most...
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  I'm sorry to have to say this on air.
[45:24.000 --> 45:25.000]  I know there may be children listening.
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  This is so profane.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  Cosette Carlo Rio.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  One of the students involved told the college fix
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  in a phone interview that the hate crime under
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  investigation is, quote, denying transgenderism.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  Oh.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  Oh.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  Oh.
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.000]  I'm scared.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  Sorry.
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  Carlo's account.
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  Her account of the...
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  The account agrees in part with an e-mail by the
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  husband of the employee with whom she tangled.
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.000]  She had great courage to face down this evil one.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  The employee told Carlo, who identifies as
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  gender neutral.
[46:11.000 --> 46:12.000]  Oh, good.
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  Good.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  Good demon.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  Excuse me.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  That only two genders exist, male and female.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  According to the student, Carlo told the fix.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  The statement was the hate crime.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  In fact, Carlo responded that you can have your
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  opinion and long as it doesn't deny my existence.
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  Just like you can't deny man-made climate change
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  or anything and pay their carbon taxes.
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.000]  Or you'll have to be arrested.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  I'm afraid.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  Continuing.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  Outside reports of what happened differ.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  She told the Los Angeles Laolian that she and other
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  students noticed that rainbow week posters had been
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  removed and placed behind a garbage can.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  I'm sure it wasn't by them to run a false flag.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  As they were reposting the signs, the employee
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  allegedly approached the students of the LGBTQ
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  barbecue issues and voiced her opinions on
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  differing sexualities expressing that anti-LGBTQ
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  signs should be put up in place of the student's
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  sign.
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.000]  Carlo told the Laolian that employees told me that I
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  was wrong and unnatural.
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.000]  An opinion editor at the Laolian also referred
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.000]  employees traditional Catholic views as a hate crime.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Yes, the announcer.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  Because it disrespected someone else's existence.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  I totally agree.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  In fact, I routinely do this and I forgot to bring it
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  today.
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  But I'm going to demand someone get on the microphone
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  in there and I want everyone in the control room
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  right now to recognize that I officially am a
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  British Springer Spaniel.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  And not just that.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  I'm a black Springer Spaniel and I'm royal.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  And I belong to the Queen of England.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  She belongs to me.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  And everyone now must recognize that I am a dog,
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  in fact, that can speak.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  And I want to be genetically altered beyond the
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  sex change to be made a female dog named Hillary
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  Clinton.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  Now, who wishes to kneel before me and accept that I
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  am in fact a black-eared dog?
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  We praise you.
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.000]  Good.
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  Let's cut to the camera.
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  Out of dog character for a moment.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  None of this is planned.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  This is all real.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  This will probably be all over TV tonight.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  Probably claim to ask you to believe it.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  I am a dog.
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  And if you deny that I can change my species,
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  you're hateful.
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  Nico, getting serious here.
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  Get on the microphone.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  Do you accept I'm a dog and then I'm going to call the
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  police?
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  I'm going to call the Austin Police Department right now.
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  If you don't recognize that I'm truly a dog and then pay for
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  my sex change to a female dog.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  Will this affect my paycheck?
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  Well, I'm going to have you arrested, buddy.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  I'm a dog, okay?
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  I accept you as you are.
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  All right.
[49:17.000 --> 49:20.000]  Now, what if I want to marry a pig?
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  That's your choice.
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.000]  You're not making fun of my existence.
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  You're not saying these are really black socks I'm wearing.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  That's hate speech.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  What are you talking about?
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  You're not saying these are black socks I'm wearing, are you?
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  No, of course not.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  Okay.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  So these are not socks.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  You're falling apart.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  Again, if you're a radio listener, folks, I've put black
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.000]  socks on my ears and I am a trans genetic creature.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  Actually, I'm a chimera and everyone has to accept it.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Thank you, Nico.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  Does anybody else want to comment in there in the control room?
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  I accept your trans species status.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  Good.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  Do it.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  Because if not, there's going to be a Spanish inquisition on
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  your butt.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  Thank you very much.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  Anybody else have any comments?
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  I've got to get down on my knees real quick.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  Hold on.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  Let's get serious.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  Oh, God.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  Oh, good.
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  Good.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  Good.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  Now, again, this is mainly a radio audience there, Matt, but Matt is
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  worshiping me right now because I have transcended my
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  humanness and I've now decided I'm a dog.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  I don't want any basic rights or freedoms or future or anything
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  else.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  I just want to be able to be weird and mentally ill and then
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  pat it on the head.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  And that's my new bobble.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  Because the globalists talked hundreds of years ago about giving us
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  bobbles to serve them, little trinkets like medals and things.
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  But now they've found just give you faux rights and weirdness and
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  then they're going to cause celeb.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  All right, I'm going to get really serious because there's
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  massive serious news.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  But I kind of went off the deep end here with all these jokes, but
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  this is really serious business.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  And we've got former Navy SEAL coming on to talk about some
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  really hardcore issues of the globalist sleeper cells bringing
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.000]  in the Muslim radicals by design and what they call the
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  Jihad Tet Offensive that I believe is being planned as well.
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  All this and more coming up serious information straight ahead.
[50:56.000 --> 51:25.000]  But actually this is deadly dangerous attacks on free speech.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  It needs to survive.
[51:27.000 --> 51:56.000]  SurvivalistCamps.com.
[51:57.000 --> 52:19.000]  Good news is it runs on 100% autopilot and you don't need any experience to get started.

[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  This is brought to you by The Conservative Investor.
[52:28.000 --> 52:57.000]  This is not indicative of future result.
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  It's true.
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.000]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[53:15.000 --> 53:21.000]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines,
[53:21.000 --> 53:28.000]  pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  The gold standard in water purification.
[53:34.000 --> 53:39.000]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  Big Berkey.
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[53:45.000 --> 53:51.000]  Call 1-877-99-Berkey or click bigberkeywaterfilters.com.

[53:55.000 --> 54:00.000]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[54:00.000 --> 54:16.000]  We're going to get really hardcore serious in the next hour looking at military threats around the world.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  Massive buildups along the Russian borders, also massive buildups obviously around China.
[54:19.000 --> 54:27.000]  And not just those threats, but also the Jihad sleeper cells that are being brought in to the west.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  Maybe I even admits they know that they're sleeper cells all over the place.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  And so when they attack, we'll have our liberties taken.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  Well, no, we're going to expose who's behind this.
[54:35.000 --> 54:44.000]  So the criminals in our government that are allowing this to happen will get in serious trouble for aiding and abetting this Jihad.
[54:44.000 --> 54:54.000]  And our governments have been doing a lot for decades behind the scenes to take out non-radical regimes or less radical regimes and put in the most horrible groups back by Saudi Arabia.
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  So that's coming up with the former top Navy SEAL in the next hour.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  Roger Stone will be joining us.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  Some of the stories up on infowars.com, speaking of free speech, I haven't even gotten to the attacks on it today.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  Every day it's like 15, 20 videos and articles.
[55:08.000 --> 55:17.000]  We have university students, student rep on free speech on national TV says some people have more equal rights than others.
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.000]  Literally from Animal Farm saying you can take some people's rights away.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  Also, Trump on Hillary, people that did far less are sitting in jail cells.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  We're going to play that clip.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  And we also have a link to the live stream.
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.000]  Donald Trump speaks on foreign policy in Washington, D.C.
[55:36.000 --> 55:42.000]  And we'll be having some of the excerpts of that as it unfolds.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  That we probably should be carrying some of that stream.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  So let's kind of punch that up maybe in the next segment.
[55:46.000 --> 55:53.000]  There are four or five minutes of that before we get to our guests, so let's go ahead and get that launched up and ready for folks.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  I was mentioning it earlier, but that is now ongoing, but we'll have clips of it for you as well.
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  Also, powerful article by Wayne Madsen.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  Why Nancy Reagan hated the Bush family?
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  You have to understand, folks, she knew they shot Reagan.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  More and more of this is coming out and it's a big deal.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  That's why the media always demonized her.
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.000]  After Reagan got shot and they kind of kept him partially drugged up, was that she knew what was going on.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  They were trying to demonize her in case she had to be taken down.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  I'm not saying she was perfect.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  She had her own problems, but now we understand why the CIA or media hated her.
[56:24.000 --> 56:36.000]  Oh, and by the way, speaking of that, Corbair, of course, has taken over CBS late night television.
[56:36.000 --> 56:43.000]  And he has come out last night, and this is in The Hollywood Reporter and Vanity Fair and others,
[56:43.000 --> 56:50.000]  and said that she would make a great CIA director, basically, that she should be running the CIA, close quote.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  Isn't that funny?
[56:51.000 --> 56:57.000]  After hundreds of news articles the last two days saying, I'm crazy, she's not connected to the CIA
[56:57.000 --> 57:03.000]  when the NFL and all of it openly is and all this cop killer stuff and all this revolution stuff is,
[57:03.000 --> 57:09.000]  because they want a failed leftist revolution to bring in tyranny and a backlash, a fascist backlash.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  And I got top experts from formerly the CIA coming on to talk about it later in the week.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  Mr. Stone and others, not Stone coming on the next hour.
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.000]  And Mr. Steele and quite a few others.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  It's just amazing how they operate and how done they think we are.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  It's really amazing.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  Paul Watson's writing an article about that.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  We'll play that clip as well.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  Before I go any further though, if you're ever thinking about getting storeable foods, the world has never been more insane.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  Things have never been deteriorating faster. I wish they weren't.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  Patriots need to be prepared.
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.000]  And the best place to get high quality storeable foods is infowarstore.com.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  We have the My Patriots supply, full spectrum, their latest deals.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  It's changed every week, up to date.
[57:49.000 --> 57:56.000]  But I private label their exact same food just as fresh, 25 years, super high quality, special diets, whatever you need.
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.000]  Hundreds of different packages, infowarstore.com or infowarselect.com
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.000]  Takes you right to infowarselect, where you get 30 to 40% off.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  You normally get 5 to 10% off their already lowest price.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  I did that to be able to have the lowest price on their great line.
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  But I'm allowed every once in a while, contractually,
[58:14.000 --> 58:20.000]  Is it a few times a year to offer it at 30 to 40% off that's running right now.
[58:20.000 --> 58:26.000]  And I think we're going to end it on Monday, because it's really, sales are very substantive.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  Profit isn't too big per sale, but we're having a lot of sales, so that's good to fund the overall operation.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  Find out more at infowarstore.com.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  And you get free shipping on the other items in infowar's life.

[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  infowarstore.com is the umbrella site. Stay with us.
[58:44.000 --> 58:51.000]  We'll have some of the Trump stuff coming up.
[58:51.000 --> 58:55.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[58:55.000 --> 59:02.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[59:02.000 --> 59:08.000]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  They had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[59:15.000 --> 59:21.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[59:28.000 --> 59:40.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[59:43.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  On corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you now from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  From deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide, we've got a very special guest joining us to break down the sleeper cell agenda of the club.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  We're bringing radical jihadis by the millions.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  That's coming up, but right now, let's go to Trump live in D.C.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  We're coming to you from Austin, Texas, but let's take you now live in D.C. with his foreign policy speech.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Feed terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  We need to be clear-sided about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  Tell a prompter free, folks. You're actually saying it.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  We desire to live peacefully, and in friendship with Russia and China, we have serious differences with these two nations and must regard them with open eyes.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  But we are not bound to be adversaries.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  We should seek common ground based on shared interests.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Some say the Russians won't be reasonable.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  I intend to find out.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  If we can't make a deal under my administration, a deal that's great, not good, great for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  It's as simple as that. We're going to find out.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Fixing our relations with China is another important step, and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  China respects strength, and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  We have a massive faith deficit.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  He's acting like there's a little bit of teleprompter, but I heard he wasn't going to use one, but then it doesn't sound like it was written.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  It sounds like it's regular talking points, so we're going to find out. It doesn't matter.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  I don't care if it's a foreign policy speech, somebody does their own teleprompter if they wrote their speech.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Let's keep going with this.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Right now, look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be doing it.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  No respect for this country or this president.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  If need be, that's what's going to have to happen.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  After I've elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO's outdated mission and structure grown out of the Cold War
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  I said NATO is opening the door to conquer Europe with the Islamic Horde. That's the problem.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  But if America fights, it must only fight to win.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  That's Ron Paul's quote. That's right. Quick, known missions.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary. And I mean absolutely necessary.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  And we'll only do so if we have a plan for...
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Trump has the same hand signs as I do. I don't do those on purpose. I just do it.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Have you ever noticed that? That's where I get accused of like secret signals.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  And prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined...
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Isn't it good to see a presidential candidate using their hands? Everybody uses their hands here. They just have this talking head thing.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Well, after the drubbing Ted Cruz received in five primaries last night, Gateway Pundit has declared its official Ted Cruz
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  mathematically eliminated from GOP race. And they included a chart. But he did win one delegate in Rhode Island.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  But the Never Trump folks are seeing things a little differently. They declared after last night's drubbing,
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  no worry, the path to the nomination does not hinge on any of these outcomes.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  That's right. They're still planning on stealing the nomination with voterless elections.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  But it doesn't look like Ted Cruz, who called a basketball hoop a basketball ring while in the Hoosier state,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  or John Kasich, who eats his pizza with a fork will be dropping out anytime soon.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  In fact, they've now teamed up to try and take down the Donald. But here's more bad news for them.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Trump has passed Romney in the popular vote total and is likely to break the GOP record.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  More people are jumping parties to the Republican Party to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Ted, just listen to Adrian. You can't win.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News. And check out InfowarsLife.com
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  for some of our amazing nutraceuticals.

[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  Secret 12, Infowars Life's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  InfowarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12,
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  No needles, no injections. Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Discover the secret. Secret 12.

[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Donald Trump just finished his first big official foreign policy speech.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  We carried quite a bit of it. We'll have some of the transcript for you in the next hour and go over it.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  When his former campaign head, and still one of his top advisors, Roger Stone joins us,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  as he does at least once a week, coming up in the second, third hour today.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  We're now in the second hour right now.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  There is so much unfolding, so much going on.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  What you have to understand is, our government agencies now are pretty much entirely run
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  by multinational corporations. That's not denied.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  And so you have to understand, the Central Intelligence Agency got Congress three years ago.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  You can just type this into Google. You'll get the Washington Post reporting on it to change the law
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  so the CIA could operate domestically in propaganda, including deception of the American people.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  And then I come out and say, look at the NFL with all these anti-cop half-time shows with Beyoncé
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  and her running around with a baseball bat, and she's mad at her husband,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  breaking car windshields and burning things down with young women watching approvingly.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  This is cultural destabilization, 101.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  So they had hundreds of publications come out and say, I was crazy.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  The CIA is not involved in domestic media.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  And then they had Stephen Colbert last night, on late night,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  that he's taken over from David Letterman, come out and say, quote,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  this is all just in your face, making fun of you folks, that he thinks Beyoncé should be running the CIA
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  just randomly, just threw that in there.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  We're going to play that clip later. This is how stupid they think you are.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  Now, we're about to go to our guest. We're going to preface it with that,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  that we see them telling us, oh, we have a delegate process. Votes have never counted.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  That's ridiculous. They're trying to sell you on the idea
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  that delegates aren't supposed to represent the votes from their precinct.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  They've manufactured these superdelegates out of thin air.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  They're trying to break our will, but it's not working.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  AP poll, Gallup polls and others show between six and 8% approval for mainstream media
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  and it's only dropping. 6% last week in the AP poll.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  It was 8% a few months before that in Gallup.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  These people are less popular than scurvy on a ship or something.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  I mean, it is just amazing. These people are less popular than syphilis,
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  but they sit up there and they just keep shoving lies like Obama.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  I never said we wouldn't have boots on the ground in Syria.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  He said it 16 times. We played the clips.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  It's a new level of lies and it's reached the Marie Antoinette level
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  where they just say let them eat cake.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  Why would they bring in the last three years five million people into Europe?
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  A million just in the last six months or so.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Claim it was a few hundred thousand here and there and then suddenly,
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  oh, it's been two, three, four, five million.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Hundreds of thousands here cover it up and say it's a few thousand.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Every high school in town, including my alma mater,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  has over 200 refugees from quote Syria and they're really Saudi Arabian and others.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  This is a Sunni invasion, a Wahhabist invasion.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  On record into Syria, then into Turkey,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  who opens up a conduit all the way through Europe with Merkel and Halan
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  and all the rest of them and the Swedish Prime Minister saying come to me,
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  come to me and kicking old people out of their government housing and moving them.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  This is all confirmed.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  We've had our reporters over there in no-go zones, in Paris and in Brussels,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  Belgium, where they would go 10 miles in any direction and Muslims would just run out like,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  get out of here screaming at them in French or English or Arabic.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  And Biggs has been in a lot of combat.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  He heard them in Arabic saying get out of here, infidel, infidel.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  He's an infidel in his arm tattooed, freaking out on them.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  And then they go on TV and say there's no no-go zones in the U.S. or in England or in this.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  This is what's going on.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  Why would the establishment open a conduit up for the last three years,
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  bring them in, let them come in, judicial watch, got more documents.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  We went down there and found the mosque on the Texas border,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  that they've got sleeper cells coming over.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  We know this is going on.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  So the question is, why would our governments be doing this?
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  At a level where upwards of 80% they admit with the passports are military aged men,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  a lot of them brag on their Facebook and Twitter.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  Hey, German ladies, I'm here.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  Here I was in combat in the Free Syrian Army a year ago.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Why would you do that?
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  It is a giant sleeper cell invasion.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  And I had the founder of Elkie for sure at Rhodes on a few weeks ago.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  And he said, you need to get Matt Bracken on.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  He really knows what he's talking about.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  You should go read his articles.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  And I did read them and just they're amazing.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  In fact, I want to start reposting them on infowars.com.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  And of course, looking to his side, if he'd be gracious enough for us to do that,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  because it's very, very important.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Ket take two, Islam's 2016 European offensive.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  And he's the author of Enemies, Foreign and Domestic and a well-known advocate
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  for Second Amendment rights.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  The following guest essay by Bracken is also being published at Western Rifle Shooters Association.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  And he's also in another article dealing with burning down the house in 2016.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  He sees war in the near future before a new president takes office.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  We're going to look at that coming up as well.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  But Enemies, Foreign and Domestic.com.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Enemies, Foreign and Domestic.com.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  And I'm not going to go over this whole bio.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  You can go there and see it, but a long career in the Navy Seals going back into the 1980s.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Beirut, you name it, just all over the world.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Panama Canal, it goes on and on.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  What he's seen.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  So he's actually been there, done that, witnessed how people infiltrate,
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  both from the side of an infiltrator, someone trying to find the infiltrators.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  And he has really written some detailed breakdowns of what's happening.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  He's a self-described freedom supporter, a constitutionalist who believes in
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  original intent of the founding fathers of our country.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  He lives with his family in North Florida.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  So Matt, thanks for coming on.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  Reading your essay, just studying history and what's happening.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  I can find no fault.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  And of course, you bring your military background to it as well.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  A lot of folks respect your writing.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  You've heard what I've said in the last five minutes.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  Was that overall accurate?
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  And what can you add in an overall overview for folks in the next five minutes
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  before we go to break?
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Okay, it's perfect.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  Your byline of your website and your show, there is a war for our minds,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  a battle going on for our minds.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  It doesn't matter if we're like monks in an Irish monastery discussing
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  what's actually happening.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  If the war for the minds is being lost at the mass level,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  we make fun of the North Koreans.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  We show them doing the wave in stadiums,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  or swooning for dear leader.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  But look at Swedes.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  They've been brainwashed into actually hating themselves.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  So when they look at the mirror, they say,
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  this blondness just has to go.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  We're so guilty of everything.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  Swedes in America, I mean, the madness over transgender.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  I just saw a YouTube video on a college campus.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  The guy says, what if I want to be,
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  if I feel that I'm a six foot five Chinese woman,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  and everybody agrees if that's what you feel,
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  then we should respect you as a six foot five Chinese woman.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  So you can see how much work we have to do.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  I mean, the fact that after a century of communism,
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  100 million to 200 million killed under the various socialist banners,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  you have the young generation supporting this retread Bernie Sanders,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  who honeymooned in Nicaragua and Soviet Union,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  Nicaragua during a revolutionary phase.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  I think this is an extremely dangerous time.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  I think that 2016 is like a 1916 or 1787 or 1788.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  Another key turning, another key point of pendulum.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  So a crossroads.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  A big crossroads.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  We're going to have the big Marxist breakout,
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  especially for example, let's say Trump wins.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  There's no kinetic event like an assassination.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  All of these can happen.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Massive riots like Watts, Ferguson, Baltimore, constantly.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Imagine Cleveland on fire during the convention
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  with armored personnel carriers all the way around the Beltway.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  We see Beyonce and MTV priming the pump.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  That's got to be a directive from on top.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  Absolutely.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  That's the narrative.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  So this is the war for the mines.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  And in Germany, they actually have a new word.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  I think it's lügenpresse, but it means liar press.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  So they refer to that, the mainstream media.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  And I would include almost everything that you can turn on your cable channel
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  is more or less controlled media.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  They don't get out of certain boundaries.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  If anything says anywhere peripherally that this could be a conspiracy theory,
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  they absolutely won't touch it.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  Oh, there's total scripting.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  There's total scripting.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  There are conspiracies to come off.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  Exactly.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  Total scripting.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  So please continue, Matt.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Well, I think that the biggest danger we're going to have riots in this country,
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  but in Europe, we're going to have an outbreak of Bezlan, the Paris attacks,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  Brussels attacks, something very significant happened during the Brussels attacks.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  And you have to understand that a government, a mass,
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  a big organization has to have a communication structure.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  It's not like one brain.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  It has many individuals.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  So you have to put a lot of credence in such things as the security levels.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  They went from their maximum security level four back down to three within like 24 hours
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  or 48 hours while terrorists were still in the loose because they were absolutely wiped out.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  Everybody worked the maximum of overtime.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  They're exhausted.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  They can't do it.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  They have to go home and sleep.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Europe has no bench.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  I think the German army is like 50,000 troops and they are unionized and they won't work
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  over 40 hours and during NATO exercises, they just quit halfway because the union rep says,
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  that's it and we don't cross rivers after dark or whatever.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  So they have no bench.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  We're going to have an outbreak in Europe.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  It'll probably start with maybe 8, 10, a dozen attacks widespread.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  The terrorists have learned the utility of the synergistic effects of having attacks
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  in various places at the same time.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  We used to think of it as an al-Qaeda signature like the East Africa embassies being exploded
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  on the same day but it's more than that.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  It's the way to overwhelm the security system and in Europe, that's going to be a big problem
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  at the same time that we're going to see these Bezlan type attacks.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  We're going to see infrastructure attacks.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  And they'll probably do it on a holiday like they did at the Tet Offensive knowing most
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  of the security services are taking a well-earned break.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Yeah, and it's not going to be like the Tet in Vietnam, folks that remember that where
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  that was an actual instruction orders had been assigned.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  That CIA completely missed it or they might as well have missed it if any messages were
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  coming in from the field they were disregarded.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  But they infiltrated 80,000 VC fighters into cities and then all on the same day,
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  they went and grabbed AK-47s and satchel charges from caches and ran amok.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  It won't be like that in Europe.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  I'm not saying there are 80,000 guys with an order to go on Bastille Day.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  It's not going to be like that.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  But when there are, say, 10 attacks, like on a Bezlan or Paris or Brussels level,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  that continues so that tomorrow there's another one and then there's somebody just
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  running amok with a knife.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  Rolling cascade attacks cells with no communication, almost impossible to identify.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  It will self-reinforce because the mindset is different.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  They will self-reinforce.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  Remember, in that religion, that ideology, a pimp, a drug pusher, he's not sinning.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  If he's selling this stuff to infidels, good for you, buddy.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  You're really a sharp one.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  It's a perfect example to be evil.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  That's why they're so into gangsterism, raping women, sex with other men.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  They call themselves these followers of Abraham.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  It's sick.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  But at the very last moment, you can spend your whole life a drug pusher and a pimp
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  and running a discotheque for infidels, and you can undo that all, pull a parachute,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  and straight to your 72 virgins.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  Get out of jail free card.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Smoke dope, party with infidels.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  You can't do enough good deeds just like tithing extra or praying extra.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  It's impossible for that person, that sinner, to do enough good deeds if he lived to be
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  100 to go to heaven.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  But he can be the worst person in the world, pusher, pimp, armed robber.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  He goes straight to the 72 virgins if he kills some infidels.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  So that's why it will self-reinforce.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  When you see that the security services are completely overwhelmed, they're exhausted,
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  there are no more, then another school has taken down, how do you react to it?
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  Especially if the guys are on a suicide mission where they want to just kill all the kids
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  like it does.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  Clearly, sir, I want to get into the details because you ran embassy security.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  You're one of the top experts on this, obviously.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  Matt Bracken, enemiesfarneatomestic.com is our guest.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  It's so important.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  I skipped this break.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  But specifically getting into big picture, talking about our elites, the leftist.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  I mean, I know they're reckless.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  I know they hate better clingers.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  I know they want to conquer the West.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  They see Christian, Judaic backgrounds as not working in their new system.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  They want a cultureless, plastic system.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  So they bring in the most radical jihadis, tens of thousands of them, undoubtedly.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  So here's the question.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  They start attacking.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  What are our governments thinking?
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Why are they doing this?
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  What is the, I mean, I understand the mission of the jihadis.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  It's cloured piven. You speak about it all the time, better than anybody.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  It's cloured piven.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  This is the Jacobins in 1788 plotting how to disrupt the grain market in France so that
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  they can engineer food riots to overthrow the aristocracy.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  Okay.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  So with your Navy SEAL high-level background, not a door kicker, but a guy involved in everything,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  conferring with my historical analysis and Lord Moxons, everybody else, it's not our
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  opinion.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  It's not that we agree.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  How do we fight 21st century Jacobins allied with Islam, which strangely enough, towards
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  the end, they allied with Islam again 200 years ago.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  So these people never change.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  So how do we deal with them?
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Information war.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  There is a war on for our minds.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  And the high ground is how do we leverage social media, access to mainstream media, books like
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  the ones that I've written.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  My books were all about false narrative and getting people to see beyond.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  My first novel starts with a false flag attack into a stadium where a sniper precipitates
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  a panic stampede, and it's sold in the media and by the government as a right-wing militia
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  kook and a reason why we have to outlaw all semi-automatic weapons.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  It's my books and my writing.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  It's about getting people to look beyond the curtain.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  Well, I want to read your books.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  I want to get you on a routine basis.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  And I'm Stuart Rose.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  All the folks that are in the know really respect you.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  So let's go back briefly then.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  Let's talk about the Jacobins.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Lead forward.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  You're talking about how they would engineer food riots, how they bring in societal crisis
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  to get control.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  They're the proto-communist in the history books.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  That's what we're dealing with.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  So break that down.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  And then what the end game is, bringing in millions of jihadis.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  Yeah.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  The Jacobins said their motto was out of chaos order.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  But first they have to create the chaos.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  So they're not saying that it was just chaos in feudal Europe.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  They're saying we create chaos.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  And you have to, in other words, demolish a building, then build it back up with the bricks
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  the way that you want them organized.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  You can't just go into a building and change a little few pipes and windows.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  You demolish it.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  When it's admised, the granular level, like Cambodia, Poland in World War II, at that level,
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  you can do anything.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  You can macro engineer.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  The trains can be running.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  The buses can be running.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  But you have to get to, we're in a pre-revolutionary state now.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  But they're going to pull out all the stops, especially if it looks like Trump is going
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  to win.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  Certainly before he's inaugurated, we'll see a complete go for broke scenario, both
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  in Europe, which will be this major Muslim offensive.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  The end result of that will be a grand compromise, which is like half Sharia today.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  And as we know, that means three quarters Sharia in a generation.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  And you're in Yemen in two generations.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  In our country, we're going to see a complete fragmenting of the society along racial lines
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  primarily.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  It's going to be brutal.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  I call it Rwanda times Yugoslavia times.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  This is the takedown of America.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  I totally concur.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  And I agree.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  The communists are activating.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  They're suddenly all over awesome with red flags.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  They're smiling.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  They say the time of blood is here.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  They're activating their sleeper cells.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  And I would expect to see communists start carrying out terror attacks.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  And as you said, false flagging the patriots.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  What do police departments do?
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  What does the military do?
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  Because they're going to be caught in the middle of this.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Especially when terrorists in Europe will see it first because this Islamic Tet is going
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  to happen in Europe.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  It's going to be a huge wake up for us.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  It may lead to a landslide victory for Trump.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  Imagine something worse than 9-11 in October.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  How does Hillary explain that?
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  People come in from Benghazi and blow up Rome.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  It's going to make Trump a sure victor if that happens.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  And then the left will say, this is our chance.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  We have to go for it.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  And there'll be street riots like between the communists and the national socialists
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  in Berlin.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  I expect to see shooting at some of these big demonstrations or explosions going off.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  And in that way, the powers that be can say, we need to put in a little bit of emergency
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  conditions.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  Therefore, the protests will have to be in separate safe zones 10 miles outside the
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Beltway at a designated FEMA camp or whatever they want to say.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  But we're going to see the freedom of assembly taken away.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  The key word, and that's almost like a code word, when you start hearing emergency because
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  they'll never say martial law.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  Those words will never come out of Obama, Jarrett, Michelle, that crowd.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  It'll be emergency.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  They'll say, during the present emergency, we can't afford to have these mass demonstrations,
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  which always lead to violence and unfortunately bombs going off and people shooting.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  So we have to put that in abeyance.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Now, if there's a real take down, the grid goes down before November, then there'll be
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  no election.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  If there's no electricity, there's no election.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Then we're automatically into an emergency situation.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  Another way that the communists can engineer this is to start a rumor, doesn't have to
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  have any boots on the ground.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Just start a rumor, an internet rumor that white racist crackers are planning to snipe
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  at black folks lined up at the polling stations.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  Just a rumor, it's all it takes.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  You can even put up a fake YouTube if you want.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Find something from 10 years ago somewhere else.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Recaption it as this happened yesterday and it'll sound like rednecks are dragging blacks
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  behind chains in Mississippi and shooting and threatening to shoot at blacks and polling
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  stations.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  If that suppresses the black turnout, or even if it doesn't, they'll just say that it did,
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  then they'll say that the election would have swung when that vote, which was suppressed
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  by white violence.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  This is a narrative that will be completely sold by the mainstream media.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Just like the burning black churches thing turned out to be totally fake.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Just like the lacrosse team was fake.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  That was all beta testing and they're just launching this everywhere.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  We'll be on our own in our own parallel free media as long as we have it.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  Now I wrote a short story called What I Saw at the Coup.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  I should have finished a novel a couple of years ago, but it's too important that I
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  write these things, the short stuff that's linked on my website.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  We've got to get everything out now.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  New Babylon, What I Saw at the Coup.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  The internet we can't take for granted.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  This is like right now our freedom fighter pipeline.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  YouTube, info wars.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  Gotta use it now, folks.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  Use it now.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  They're going to take it away.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  I heard from folks that were at a law enforcement conclave that there's a lot of buzz about Facebook
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  and how they're going to tune people down.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  They're also doing their information.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Now first they're going to start restricting.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  It's already begun.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  Stay there, Matt Bracken.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  This guy's 100% dead on from my research.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  So he can give us the other angle on it.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  He's going to come back and break down the different angles of how this can unfold and how we stop it, hopefully.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  I'll tell you right now, if everybody is trying, you're idiots.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  I can feel it in my gut and I can see it.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000]  We are.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  It's coming.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  It's here.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  Well, after the drubbing Ted Cruz received in five primaries last night,
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  Gateway Pundit has declared it's official.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  Ted Cruz mathematically eliminated from GOP race.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  And they included a chart.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  But he did win one delegate in Rhode Island.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  But the Never Trump folks are seeing things a little differently.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  They declared after last night's drubbing,
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  no worry, the path to the nomination does not hinge on any of these outcomes.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  That's right.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  They're still planning on stealing the nomination with voterless elections.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  But it doesn't look like Ted Cruz who called a basketball hoop a basketball ring while in the Hoosier state.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  Or John Kasich who eats his pizza with a fork will be dropping out anytime soon.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  In fact, they've now teamed up to try and take down the Donald.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  But here's more bad news for them.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  Trump has passed Romney in the popular vote total and is likely to break the GOP record.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  More people are jumping parties to the Republican Party to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  Ted, just listen to Adrian.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  You can't win!
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  And check out InfowarsLife.com for some of our amazing nutraceuticals.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Infowar when you visit InfowarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nation iodine.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  And all the great products at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield Nathan Iodine,
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  It is exclusive to InfowarsLife.com and the InfowarsLife family of incredible products.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, Secret 12 X2 SuperMail Brain Force Prostigar Silver Bullet.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy them, folks.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  Thank you, brother.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  Welcome to the Infowars.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Infowar at the same time.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nathan Iodine.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  Right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  What products are you taking?
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  Everything from SuperMail to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourselves.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  Matt Bracken's our guest.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  He's at enemiesfarrenanddomestic.com.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  I want to read his books.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  I want to carry them. I haven't read them yet, but I'm told they're excellent.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  Nonfiction, and I guess some of them are fiction, but he can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  But what he's saying, I mean, the way he's breaking it down, notice how much energy he's got, how concerned he is.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  I bet money when this guy isn't on air, he's not like that.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  But you start talking about this, there's no way you can't get animated and start just really connecting it to everything
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  because it's scientific, it's a rollout, it's been done in other countries,
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  it's been beta tested in Europe, Europe's about a year, maybe two ahead of us.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  And I'm telling you, I'm going to see if he agrees with me.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  The way to try to back them off is if they think that it's absolutely going to fall flat on its face
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  and that we know who's in charge of it, people like Soros, the globalist,
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  they're operatives inside the different agencies and the big banks,
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  instead of their puppets and we let them know we know the plan and the police and military do,
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  which I know that's happening, and I've been a big critic of the police and the military carrying out bad operations,
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  but there's some of the most awake people out there.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  So that's two separate issues that then they may back off.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  The problem is that might actually scare them into doing it anyway.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  So we're kind of reaching a moment in history where things are collapsing, they've engineered it this way,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  but once you turn this thing loose, it's a juggernaut, I don't think they can put it back in the bottle.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  So I'm just telling you right now, yes, this is how we fund the operation.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  We fund the operation selling things that we believe in and we use,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  and we're running the biggest special that we can run possibly on InfoWars Select high-quality swareable foods.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  It's my patriot food, the same stuff, packaged at the same time.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  I can contractually offer bigger discounts on already great deals with it being privately labeled InfoWars Select.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  We're running a special for just a few more days, 30 to 40% off all InfoWars Select swareable food,
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  go to InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsSelect.com, takes you right to the subpage,
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  and you can buy my patriot exact same food if you want for a lot more.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  It's still very, very good, but it's exact same food, and that's why we normally sell both brands,
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  because it's the same stuff and it's just the way contracts and stuff like this works.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  They have a bunch of other distributors, so I have to follow all these contracts and rules,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  and I've just found a way to bring you the lowest price out there, so that's what we've done.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  InfoWarsStore.com also Anthroplex is just a whole bunch of known high quality herbs
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  that naturally boost your stamina, your energy, your libido.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  I don't want to say it's the poor man's, super male vitality, but that's basically what it is.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  It's just a powder form instead of a liquid cold press form.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  Quite frankly, in some cases it's probably stronger than super male or super female,
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  but it has different effects for different people.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  Talk with your physician before, it's all recognized as safe, but this stuff's real.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  You'll probably notice one in a day or two when you get up in the morning.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  InfoWarsStore.com Anthroplex is back.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  After two months of being sold out, super male is about to sell out.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  There's plenty of super female.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  I don't know why it works just as good as the male on males or females.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Also, DNA force is back in stock.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  X2 is there.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  You can get 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship, and orders of $50 or more,
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  ladies and gentlemen, are free shipping.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  Quite frankly, now more than ever, it is time to get as aggressive as you can in the media,
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  however you can, warning people about what's happening while personally getting yourself ready.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  And let's just hope all these collapses and organized revolutions that have been carried out by the globalist in the last few years
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  aren't going to come here.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  But you look at what they've done everywhere else, they're trying it here.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  The overthrow in Ukraine, the Arab Spring, all this stuff is run by the very same nasty people.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  I mean, the latest James Bond movie they admitted was advised by MI6.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  And the quantum group is the name of George Soros' fund.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  And the bad guy who runs Spectre is the head of the quantum group.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  He's the guy that tried to crash the British pound.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  Even intelligence agencies are telling you who runs Spectre.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  So, understand, Ian Fleming was MI6.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  This is art imitating life, not the other way around.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  And I have to say, one person is like a top general of this globalist crime syndicate, it's Soros.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  But there's others even worse than him.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  And these are people that have bad will towards the West.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  I'm going to shut up now for Matt Bracken, because I've been jumping in a lot.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  He's just laying out so much knowledge.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  Start wherever you want, go wherever you want.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Former Navy SEAL involved in a lot of clandestine operations all over the world.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  You can find out more at enemiesforeignanddomestic.com.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  It comes highly recommended, and I can tell why now, because I was unaware of this guy.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  There's so many great patriots out there.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  I know the patriots know who he is.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  I just get so busy covering news.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  And then Matt, lay out this TED offensive.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  How do you think we stop it?
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  You've got the floor, my friend.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  I don't think we stop it.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  I think that the forces are in motion, or like deep sea tsunamis.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  The earthquakes already happened, and the waves were moving across the ocean.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  There was going to be a convergence.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  What people tend to do is look at each potential calamity in isolation and say,
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  well, that's survivable.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  If just a hurricane just hit New Orleans, that's survivable.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  But if you get 100 Katrina's that happen at the same time, the system is shocked.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  It goes into shock.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Can't move.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  It can't save itself.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  Like somebody being shot once in the foot compared to being shot 20 times at once.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  We're going to have an overload of the system.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  Now, the plan might be for this Marxist takedown.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  I look at it like a pyramid, and you have at the very top some very few very evil people.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  And I think that there you could almost, depending on your religious persuasions,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  you could call them almost like a satanic influencer force.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Below that, you have people that are also evil, but they really believe in communist revolution,
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  and that we're going to attain it.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  But obviously, we're not going to attain a communist revolution.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  We're armed to the teeth in this country.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  But we will have a massive civil war.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  But the civil war won't be a geographic north-south civil war.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  It's going to be a society tearing into itself civil war, kind of in the way of Bosnia,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  where people all speak the same language, but they have different factions.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  In this country, there will be such a strong racial element that it's going to get out of control in a very ugly way.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  And the problem is that there's no way to recoup the civilization.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  It's a very precious bubble floating that we're floating in, and we take it for granted.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  But our modern civilization is much more dangerous to ourselves than previous civilizations,
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  because, for example, calamities that happened to Europe, black death, 30 years of war,
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  Cromwell in Ireland, events that killed a third of a population, say, in a generation.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  You could still just grow food on your own acre and survive.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  Our food, we don't grow it anymore.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  Our food comes from thousands of miles away.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  We all now are living in the equivalent of a glass bubble on Mars.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  And we don't see the glass bubble.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  We just think how pretty outer space is.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  But electricity has become our oxygen, and we're living under this false glass, artificial glass bubble.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  It's such a complex system now.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  It has to run perfectly.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  I think I found my new guru.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  Man, you see it exactly like I do, because that's how it is.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  If we have a collapse event, it will take hundreds of years to try to even get back,
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  but the reactors will start melting down within a matter of months.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  I mean, oh my God.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  It might be like Argentina.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  You'll have to get to, you know, the north could be a nuclear wasteland,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  depending on, I don't really technically, I can't profess any great knowledge about nuclear plant safety.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  But if the economy locks up, if the grid goes down, something people need to understand.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  There are three parallel systems, like our nervous system, muscular system, bone structure.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  We have a financial system, an electrical grid, and a computer network system.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  If any one of those three is attacked really in depth, you know, recurring attacks,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  then all three collapse and our society collapses.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  You cannot, you know, if the financial system collapses, people can't get money out of the ATM.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  They loot the stores, game over.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  If the computer system collapses, the grid runs out of control, you know, pipelines go open,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  haywire all over the collapsed, all game over.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  So any of those three collapse, financial, computer, global computer network,
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  it's mostly Cisco hardware running over fiber optical cables, and the electrical grid,
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  which we know that Metcalf station attacked out in California a year ago,
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  looking at it from as a spec ops officer, that was a proof of concept test.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  That was a very professional thing.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  They had gone through underground cut optical trunks, did things so that there would be no rapid response,
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  fired at these giant transformers, shut the thing down.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  That to me was somebody showing somebody else that if we do this 20 times, we take down America.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  Proof of concept.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  Proof of concept.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  And increase my budget, because if I have 20 teams, if you budget me for 20 teams,
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  the people I would be looking at would be foreign students.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  That's the way that you can cycle commandos into a country.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  They can come in, for example, for one year of being a student, and they can recon their whole area.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  They can come in another year as a student in another college,
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  and at the last minute, be organized into a cell, take out these stations.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  I just say, look, if Iran, just to pick on Iran here,
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  if they're going to spend billions of dollars on a nuclear program,
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  why wouldn't they spend a few million on a cheap kill grid takedown scenario just using commandos disguised as students?
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  That's what we would do if we were smart and had that mindset.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  KGB used to plan that kind of thing.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  But how can we assume that our grid is not going to be collapsed at some point,
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  especially with these Marxists trying to do the big takedown between the conventions and the inauguration as time of maximum danger?
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  I think of it as 1917 in Russia or 1789 in France.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  And again, they want it to collapse so they take over.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  But they can't take over. This is the thing.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  A plan, this is what I say a lot, a plan to ride a tiger is not the same as riding a tiger.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  So when Mao took over in China, 40, 50 million people died in the first round.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  And communism still didn't work, but it can wreck a society.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  And what I'm afraid is we're going to have in this country a wrecked society.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  Now we have to hold on to the Bill of Rights no matter who's put on the Supreme Court.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  They can say the moon is made out of green cheese and that anybody that says they're a giraffe, you have to call them a giraffe.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  It won't make it reality.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  They can't take away our First or Second Amendment rights if they try to.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  I don't care if they stack the deck with communists on the Supreme Court.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  We have to defend every liberty at point-blank range and promote it everywhere.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  Because we may not have this pipe. We may not have this means of communication.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  We could have our internet taken away.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  I wrote the short story.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  You can just look at these things on the internet called what I saw at the coup,
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  where as the backdrop is a missile war in the Middle East that takes down our grid temporarily
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  and our internet for longer.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  And during that period, troublemakers like us are quietly taken off the stage left.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  Because there's no way for anybody to know what's happening to anybody for that month.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  And then when the internet comes back on, it comes back on in a much more controlled way.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  And how this is going to go is they've already got the commasars and the UN Strong Cities Initiative in every major city
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  quote advising the police.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  And so if the police go along with it and the Justice Department doesn't come in and harass them and take over.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  And so they're already setting up these contacts during a collapse to have the commasars order the police
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  and local security services led by federal leaders to go out and round up the patriots.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  The police and others just have to not follow those orders at that point.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  Plus, you really want that job trying to go round up all the veterans?
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  That's the plan to ride the tiger.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  It's not the same as riding the tiger.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  In my first novel, the guys that actually shoot into the stadium on opening day of that Washington FedEx football field
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  from a mile away, somebody rainbow arcs in some SKS rounds causing a panic stampede.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  Now, these are just two ATF, you know, mid-level executives that want to see the ATF's budget increase
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  because it'll increase their power and prestige.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  They know that they're not going to wind up with America being disarmed.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  They know it'll lead to a civil war.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  They know people won't turn in their semi-automatic weapons.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  But they're happy to start a civil war if they're in charge of like one of the factions that's going to be very powerful.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  Crisis is our brand.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  Right.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  And we're going to see events then completely out of control, particularly if, as I said, the financial system,
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  if you look at Deutsche Bank and situations in Europe that are more dire even than with our Fed and our quantitative easing,
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  Europe is in just as much of thin ice financially.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  Imagine when this TET breaks out, nobody will be going to work for months.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  So what happens to the economy?
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  The metros are closed.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  Every time a metro runs again, somebody jumps out and blows one up.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  Sure.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  No more metros.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  That's how they get to work.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  They move to round up all the Muslims in Europe and here because they're sleeper cells.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  You'll almost have to.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  But under the cover of that, then they'll have the president to round up everybody they want.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  And you can see that as the kind of right wing response being sold by former CIA directors and others.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  That's another program they've got cooking.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  So both the right wing and left wing elements of the power structure want the crisis because they all think they're going to battle each other inside the control grid
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  for who gets control of the crisis.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  They're unleashing something, as you've said properly, that is uncontrollable and will bring in meltdown worldwide that's probably not survivable.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  We have to somehow communicate with these different establishment groups and say, listen, your guy upstairs is probably Satan himself.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  Stop following these orders, you lunatics.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  I don't think it can be turned off.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  I don't think that if George Soros had a conversion on the road to Damascus, if George Soros turned into George Washington tomorrow and he said,
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  stop, everybody, turn around.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  There's too much momentum.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  It's now like giant boulders coming down the hill.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  I agree with you, unfortunately.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  I agree with you.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  I agree with you.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  But we need to prepare for a grid down scenario in the next year because we're not going to have a Russian revolution,
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  a French revolution through Washington DC and the power stays on.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  I promise you that in this chaos, even if engineers can't get to work because it's too dangerous because there's just people...
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  Venezuela now doesn't have power, basically no refrigeration.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  All these other countries can't do it.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  Under communism and command and control, you don't get electricity or medicine, folks.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  But it's going to probably collapse before they get anywhere near establishing a communist control.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  I understand, yes.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  We'll have a civil war like the Finns. People forget there was a war called the Winter War where little Finland actually beat the Soviet Union that rolled in thinking...
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  There's a book on that, isn't it? Total resistance?
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  Yeah, but they tangled with like a Switzerland.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  They walked right into a...
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  They sent a bunch of unmotivated reservists' conscripts into a country like Switzerland with a William Tell type of Marxist mentality,
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  you know, marksmanship culture.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  Isn't William Tell the art type of the rebel against Terry, the true story of the guy that took out all those people because they hurt his kids?
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  That's right, and that's right. He was Charles Bronson, so to speak.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  Well, there's millions of Charles Bronsons in this country, and I have to tell you, some of the most dangerous Charles Bronsons I know are older than me,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  and they might have a bad cough or they can't ride their motorcycle anymore, but they're thinking, you know, when this happens, I'm not just going to go quietly.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  I'm going to make it, you know...
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  I don't think all the leftists that can barely wipe their noses realize that they're about to stick their hand on a badger hole.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  No, that's right, and forget about AR-15s. The most common type of rifle is just the generic bolt-action deer rifle that can hit and kill a 200-pound mammal at 400 yards.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  Remington 700.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  Millions.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  I'm shot here in 1,000 yards with a Remington 700.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  And the most dangerous order of battle will be what I call the militia of one, where just one guy doesn't tell anybody, not even his wife, maybe. He just goes out.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  He goes to town with the rifle. He takes one shot, and that's it. I mean, look at the DC sniper situation. They got it totally wrong. They got the acoustics wrong.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  Stay there. Stay there, Matt Bracken. Stay there. We're going to talk about this. This is so important.

[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  Brought to you by The Conservative Investor. Current return is not indicative of future results.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  We've got five minutes here and five minutes in the next segment, and Roger Stone, the consulate, Trump, and Souther, is going to give us all the intel on what's coming up, what's developed of the big victories last night.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  The globalists are financing revolution all over the world. They're against the nation state. They play the countries off against each other.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  You go, that's like a James Bond movie. Well, that's because that's how it really works.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  And the worst element is the Anglo-American establishment. That's what they call themselves.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  It's nothing but being Anglo, but it's people that run England and the United States and a few other countries.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  It's the dominant force because it had the wealthiest, most open free market system to milk.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  And it is just running around all over the world, allied with radical Islam, and we have to get that narrative out of its game over.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  I want to invite Matt Bracken, who I got to say I'm extremely impressed with. I read some of his essays, thought they were excellent, but I tell you, I absolutely click with what he's saying.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  This means I agree with him. I totally agree with him, but it's not like I like him because I agree. It's because I know it's accurate and everything he's saying, the way it pieces together is exactly basically the way I've been seeing it.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  A lot of my other sources have been seeing it. And what's scary is it's like there's no doubt now. I mean, you can see this is the big one.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  Now, I hope and pray there's some way to avert this, push it back, whatever, but my gut is 50 times more concerned than it's ever been.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  I mean, I almost feel bad even being here on air, not getting, you know, dug in out in the countryside.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  But I realize I need to be on air as much as I can. I got a bunch of quick short questions for you, Matt.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  You got to come back for like an hour and a half if you can next week or hell, even maybe tomorrow, part two or something, because I want to really flesh this out historically.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  Get into your military background and stuff as a guy that led, you know, seals, not just, you know, out there, heroically doing a lot of this work.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  But clearly from your training, a lot of classified stuff, I can see you've really been behind the curtain.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  Looking at this, though, just quick questions. The police aren't perfect. They've been militarized by the globalist, but they're more awake to the general public.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  I found clearly there's a move to cause a civil war aimed at local government, kill the cops, kind of the army of one thing.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  But, you know, get every little thug to go shoot a cop in the back of the head. That's what Soros and the globalists have been pushing, clearly.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  What is their hope there? And shouldn't that then, and I've seen the police actually get it, shouldn't that be what we reach out the police with?
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  That, hey, we're doing Overwatch. We want to work with you. This is here. You better get operational now to stop this, because they need to be the frontline with local government to identify globalist operatives locally.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  You name it. So when all this goes down, they understand which side to be on. And I'm serious. I think that's absolutely key. What do you say?
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  Yeah, there's a, there's sort of a war within law enforcement that, you know, Stork Road roads and the oath keepers are certainly right.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  We can't turn against the police. The police are going to be required to preserve civilization. And they'll be completely, you know, they can't watch their backs as the way that Stork puts it.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  That's why the enemy's targeting the police. That's what people get mad at me that hate the cops, because the cops have done something bad to them. I get it.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  But the communists want to take them out. Get that, folks. Get that.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Right. This is a Marxist takedown, and that we're in this, we're in this stage, Lenin called it the worst, the better.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  When they said, like, you know, there's food rides in Leningrad, he said, the worst, the better. You have to create those 1789, you know, bread rides.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  He said more blood. He said more blood. Just kill carnage, random fear.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  And imagine, they didn't have electricity in 1789. They didn't have electricity in 1917. So the lynchpins that you would pull out would be, say, the food factories that bring the bread to Leningrad.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  That train doesn't make it for a week. And now there's riots. Well, today, you don't necessarily do bread. You go after the grid, you go after the computer system, you go after the financial system, then the bread stops.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  So in the absence of electricity, the computer network and the financial system, our societies will implode.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  The enemies don't need to fire a missile over a city. A missile comes in the return address. Mutual-assured deterrence works.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  But who will know who hacked our computer grid? Who do we attack if our computer grid is hacked?
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  It may be it's anonymous. Maybe it's the Koreans. It can be backtrailed through a third country.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  It can be an inside job. Obama could open the door to China.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  And it makes it much more likely to happen. Mutual-assured destruction worked during all the Cold War because each side knew where the missiles were coming from.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  But in this situation, if our financial system is hacked, if everybody's accounts just goes gibberish haywire and nobody can do a transaction, within a week the grid will be down.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  Bracken, you're absolutely right. Five more minutes straight ahead, third hour, tell everybody you know to an infox. This is serious business. This is serious business.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  We'll be back on for two hours. You take your calls next week if you can do it. They'll be back. Stay with us.

[01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  I wrote that liner 19 years ago when my show got syndicated on Genesis. I was already syndicated on a smaller outfit.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  I just had General Benton Parton, former head of the Air Force, top anti-communist, and he had all the classified info. He ran the heart program before that. He said, it's a program, Alex, and they're going to take us over.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  First, they got to break us down. He had all the terms out of their own operations. And then once they'd done that, they would then take us over and exploit us against the next country.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  And so he basically said down the road, once they first seize the federal government and start collapsing things, you'll be basically deep behind enemy lines in your own country.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  So there I was 19 years ago writing that liner, hoping we could save that off. Here we are, and they're trying to put it into place.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  Let me ask you this, Matt Bracken, and I hope you can come back for an hour and a half, two hours next week. Very impressed with your research.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  EnemiesFarnerDomestic.com to read his essays, get the books, everything. Clearly, I understand the world's going to turmoil, population.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  They've already flipped the switches where things aren't sustainable by design, hoping to ride that crisis in their own words.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  But looking at this, talking to other former Navy SEALs, former Spooks, other, you know, almost everybody I talk to that's been, you know, Delta Force, Green Berets, Navy SEALs, they're all super smart, super cool, the best people you can imagine.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  They know everything I know and more, and then they still just go, yeah, but the public's too dumbed down. When you talk to all these other folks, what are they thinking?
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  Are they all just trying to dig in for their own families as well? I mean, you know, what do we do?
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  There's a lot of digging in going on. You know, I'm past the age when an active duty guy is still on active duty.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  Most of the guys that I know from the teams and from, you know, operational background are already like firearms and kind of survivalist mentality, not all, but most of them.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  Now, if they don't hunt, they're still tactical. You know, they're always, they're never in, you know, condition green, so to speak.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  You know, you always have that sheepdog mentality going on. And when it comes to your own family, you know, you have to think about them first.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  I mean, I tell people right off the bat, what about water? You know, people want to talk about guns. I say, what about water?
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  I mean, how long does your city water go if the power goes down?
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  Water, food, firearms, friends, and getting right with God, they're all important.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  That's right. And this is going to not be, you know, the normalcy bias. We grew up, there has always been electricity.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  It's just normal human nature to think therefore there will always be electricity.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  We're so domesticated.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  We're very domesticated. But the problem is, if our electricity is cut off even for a few weeks, we, the big glass dome over us, our civilization shatters in those weeks.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  Once the stores are looted, there's no restocking them. You know, you can't take a diesel engine apart.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  And then here comes the zombie apocalypse and put it back together and get it running in a minute.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  Just on time delivery means no stockpiles.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  No stockpiles. And when the 18 wheelers run out of fuel on the freeways and at the truck stops, you know, truck stops will be like a little feudal empire.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  As long as their underground storage tanks are lasting and they've got generators, that's where you'll see all the state troopers at the truck stops.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  It'll be like the Alamo, last place with light in your county.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  Good God, oh man.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  And you see the preparations by government digging in themselves.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  Why don't we just arrest George Soros and Obama and these damn people?
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  Well, the people, it's too late. The tsunami earthquakes already happened.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  I totally agree. It's already been set in motion.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  So I guess we just get to high ground knowing the water's coming.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  And you try to warn people, you know, I'm willing to throw away all my credibility such as it is.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  I wasn't career military. I'm not a big hero. I wasn't like all this stuff that...
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  It's the guys later after me that have been like in a war footing forever, believe me. So I don't want to take that kind of credit where it's not...
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  You were more clandestine stuff back then with the SEALs, right?
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  I wasn't career and I didn't do anything amazing. I was fortunate to be in SEAL team. It's a wonderful thing.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  It was an early chapter in my life.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  But what I'm saying is there's going to be no escaping it.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  And we're like the kids at that beach in...
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  His audio just cut out.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  Okay, hold on guys. His audio just cut out. So let's...
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  Can we get Stone on too?
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  I want to come back and finish up with him for 30 seconds or a minute.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  Or get him on phones. I don't want to end like that.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  That's where his audio just cut out.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  Or we're going to find one coming from Matt Bracken.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  EnemiesForeignAndDimestic.com.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  That was a powerful interview. That guy really knows what he's talking about.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  And again, I think there's a 10% chance we're going to have a soft landing in this.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  Maybe 20%. But there's... crisis is already happening all over the world.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  He's already been proven correct.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  The Untouchables
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000]  Al Capone was not jailed for racketeering or corruption.
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  He was jailed for income tax evasion.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  Now one of the longest serving leaders of organized crime,
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  House Speaker Dennis Hastert is going to jail for a financial crime that is no crime at all.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  Hastert had been a serial sex abuser of minors before he became one of the Untouchables.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  He went on to become a leader of the racketeering group commonly known as the Congress.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  The type of operation he used was one they knew best, extortion.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  He was chosen to be leader of the GOP precisely because he could be controlled via blackmail.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  Because of the statute of limitations, Hastert will not be punished for the documented cases of abusing at least five minors.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  Instead, he'll be punished for withdrawing his own cash from his own bank account.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  Our government doesn't punish real crime.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000]  Instead, it creates legal structures that they can use to entrap people who don't harm anyone.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.

[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  Years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in, and I'll take care of you.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  Take me in, otender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  Take me in, otender woman, side the vicious snake.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  Take me in, otender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  Take me in, otender woman, side the vicious snake.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  Now she clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me, heaven's wide.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  You knew damn well I was a snake, before you took me in.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees,
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet offensive,
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  Tet style offensive in Europe, and the same things being done to this country.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had Matt Bracken on earlier, and his Skype fell at the end.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  We have two different Skype systems, and then our other one failed with Roger Stone at the same time.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  This is an example of how technology is great, but you can't completely depend on it, obviously.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  So we've got Roger Stone via video Skype, but audio via a phone, going to Roger Stone here in just a moment.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  Please understand, folks, there are corporate interests worldwide that are anti-free market,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  that are using global crises to bring in total control.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  They work with collaborators in every nation state to do this.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  We have the Communist Chinese, the Pope, the radical jihadis in Saudi Arabia, their leadership,
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  all saying we can't have Donald Trump.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  And now Donald Trump has come out with a powerful speech that he just gave in D.C. on foreign affairs
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  that we've covered, that we played part of it.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  I've read the transcript. Very, very powerful.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  He just swept five states. Ted Cruz is technically disqualified.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  They're talking about changing the rules again.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  They've got other Republican leadership coming out saying we'll start a third party.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  Joining us till about 40 after is Roger Stone, the consummate patriot, Trump insider.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  What an incredible guy. He's written a best-selling book now,
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  exposing the Bushes and their crime syndicate, their drug dealing, the CIA,
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  a book exposing the same system with the Clintons.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  I've talked to top experts that have written books on the subject.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  They say Stone got info no one ever knew.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  It's just incredible.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  Both those books, by the way, are available at infowarstore.com or stonesone.com.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  And it's so important to support people that are telling the truth.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  This is the confidant of Trump more than 40 years, his wingman.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  And he joins us to break down what's happening. Such a history.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  Austria just had patriot nationalists that they're calling extreme right wing.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  They call Trump that. He's almost too liberal for me in some cases.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  They call him super right wing. The other group isn't right wing.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  It's patriot. It's nationalist. It's common sense.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  It's like, hey, I want hot coffee in the morning in a warm bed.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  They try to take reality and invert it like it's dirty, but Trump just dominated.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  He's come out and said, Hillary, be five points if she was a man.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  Well, yeah, like Jeb Bush was five points.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  They say, oh, that's sexist. They are in panic mode.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  This is so exciting, so historical. I don't even know what to say at this point.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  Let's go to Roger Stone. He'll tell us where he is.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  He's always all over the US working like 18 hours a day.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  I mean, I get text messages from this guy at 6am and 3am at night.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  I tell you, Trump ought to give this guy a medal.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  Roger Stone, great to have you on, my friend. It is just so exciting.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  What's happened? I'm going to try to shut up till 33 after when we take a few calls with their questions at 800-259-9231.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  First time callers. Quick question for Roger Stone, 800-259-9231.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  But until then, sir, congratulations on your work. Congratulations to Donald Trump.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  Congratulations to the American people. He just gains momentum.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  So many questions, but I'm just going to let you take the helm, sir.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  Well, first of all, Donald Trump deserves enormous credit for the big win last night.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  And it was sweeping, breaking more than 50% in every state.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  It demonstrates why I think Trump is, in fact, the candidate the Democrats are afraid of,
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  because he runs well in the industrial northeast and the middle west.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  In those states that have been ravaged by NAFTA, and now that would be ravaged by TPP,
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  and Ted Cruz's expedited trade globalist deal, TPA.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  So it was a big, big night for Donald Trump. It was also a big night for his team.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  They are living off the land. They're running a true grassroots campaign.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  The Pennsylvania situation is particularly interesting because you had really two primaries,
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  a delegate primary and a preferential primary.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  Trump ran away with the preferential primary, but in order to vote for the Trump delegates,
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  you had to know who the delegates were.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  So a massive education project there, two top political operatives, David Urban and Jim Schultz,
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  along with respected federal and state Republican operatives kind of parachuted in there at the last minute,
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  and it works with the local Trump people who are very enthusiastic to build a very solid ground game.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  A true grassroots operation. Very impressive.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  So it shows again that the northeast, like the Midwest, is Trump country.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  So is the south. I mean, people just love Trump.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  I've got to interrupt you. Looking at the frontrushreport.com, Roger.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  He looks so presidential in that foreign policy speech.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  I mean, wow, if people wanted to be impressed with him being focused, that was it.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  I want that guy to represent me.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  Well, and it was a perfect tone. I mean, this speech really defined Trump's foreign policy.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Now you can see that Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations has had no effect whatsoever on his thinking.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  Trump is a bold nationalist. He is for American sovereignty.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  He's for the restoration of American power.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  He's against some globalist scheme.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  And most importantly, he is most definitely not a neocon.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  He's a non-interventionist. That's not an isolationist.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  But he quotes John Quincy Adams in his speech saying we shouldn't go looking for trouble around the world.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  That's the guy I like.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  If I liked Trump before, I'm in love now.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  Roger, what is it like for you as one of his chiefs?
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  This is history happening, an epic battle with the collectivist and the communist Chinese and the jihadis,
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  telling us we can't have Trump and the sickening mentally ill left.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  It's really something I have never seen before in American politics.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  And Trump has said this a number of times. It's not about him.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  It's about a revolution.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  It's about a last, best chance to save the country.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  So a big contest with Indiana coming up.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  This is going to be pivotal. This is Ted Cruz's last hurrah.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  But some breaking news. Today at four o'clock Eastern,
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  Ted Cruz will announce that Carly Fiorino will be his running mate for Vice President.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  Wait, has that been announced or are you giving this inside baseball?
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  Well, it is known to those of us who are professional.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  Okay, so we're going to run with the headline, Roger Stone.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  Cruz will announce Fiorina as running, made at four o'clock.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  That is what I predict now. Let's go through that for a moment.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  She's John McCain's chief issue advisor.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  She, as the head of executive at Eulah Packard, let me just put it this way.
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  Playoffs, outsourcing, golden parachute.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  She met Romney in heels. She tried this in California.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  She was ignominiously defeated when those very arguments were made.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  She is a rock rib member of the establishment.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  I like the way she cups Hillary Clinton around, but she's not doing that for her country or party.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  She's doing it for herself.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  So another globalist, another international...
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  Yeah, she's somebody that comes and sells off Eulah Packard and downsizes it,
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  and they call her a genius in the mainstream media.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  Well, not only that, but there's very strong evidence that she broke the Iranian sanction rules
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  doing business in that part of the world.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  So this is the last woman that you want as...
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  Oh, I forgot. She's been on the payroll of the Iranians.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  Yeah, no, this is a horrific choice by Ted Cruz.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  Now, with every possibility, Alex, you have so much reach and influence
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  that Ted Cruz will hear about this and change his mind before four o'clock, but I rather doubt it.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  Wow. Okay, please continue. Roger Stone, this is incredible. Please continue.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  Well, Indiana will be pivotal.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  I don't see Carly Fiorina giving Ted Cruz any bump there.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  I mean, I guess Cruz thinks this is Reagan-esque.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  I mean, it's like when Ronald Reagan picked Dick Schweiker, who turned out to be a very fine man.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  And by the way, one of the most important members of Congress,
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  skeptical about the Warren Commission and skeptical about the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  And a free thinker, a solid Second Amendment man, ironically, but a liberal Republican on social issues.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  I got to know he and his wife, Claire, who you may know was once Ms. Claire on Romper Room,
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  very, very fine people, later served in Ronald Reagan's cabinet.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  But this is not Dick Schweiker. This is someone who has the globalist stamp.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  And I don't see other than her gender what she brings to a ticket.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  I guess what Cruz is saying is that he couldn't beat Hillary alone.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  Maybe I could beat her with this woman on the ticket.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Sure. Now he's going to pull what Trump said.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  I mean, I'd love to have a woman I believed in, like a Michelle Bachman would be great,
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  or somebody like the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, who are patriots.
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  I mean, it's not that we're against women. It's true. Hillary can hardly talk.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  She's got all this corruption. She's about to probably be indicted.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  All this stuff's going on. And Trump says, listen,
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  if she was a man, she'd be 5% and they say he's anti-woman.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  No, he told the truth. Your take on his statement.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  No, I think it's exactly why people love Donald Trump,
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  because he tells you what he really thinks, that it's the God's honest truth.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  Look, her entire campaign is predicated on the premise
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  that she will get a disproportionate number of votes among women.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  And I say to you, Alex, when women learn of her real abuse of women,
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  the way she is bullied and intimidated and threatened,
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  Bill's sexual assault victims is serial.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  Let me stop you right there. That's why you're banned on CNN, MSNBC, and everywhere else.
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  That's why you're banned is because they're so scared, they'll bring that up.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  Stay right there. RogerStoneStoneZone.com.

[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  visit www.fpeusa.org.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  Alright, coming up in the next segment,
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  you're gonna be able to ask Roger Stone your questions.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  That's a real wild card.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  So that's coming up 800-259-9231.
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host after he leaves us at about 45 afters,
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  so I'm gonna hit a bunch of other science and health news, world news.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  There is so much to go over,
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  but the system is so scared of Donald Trump.
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  What are the next big pitfalls, Roger Stone?
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  What else do you expect them to pull?
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  What are they gonna do now?
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  I mean, he's gonna get their projecting, as you predicted,
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  the 1,238 or 37, they've now got Republican chiefs out.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  We'll run with the third party or we'll ignore that.
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  But I think more and more, even as Newt Genrich said,
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  look, you can't ignore this.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  It's gonna blow up in your face if you try to steal the elections from Trump.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  What does your gut tell you, Roger Stone?
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  Well, the Cruz operatives are still talking about going into the Rules Committee
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  and passing a rule that would knock out some of Donald Trump's delegates.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  And then that question comes to the convention floor
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  prior to the first ballot in the approval or disapproval of the proposed rules.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  This is why I've been talking about the so-called Trojan Horse delegates.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  While Donald Trump may have a majority for president on the first ballot,
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  I think the anti-Trump forces will have a majority on the floor
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  on questions of rules and credentials.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  There's any number of ways to steal this nomination by an adversarial report
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  from either one of those committees that used trickery
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  to unseat validly elected Trump delegates.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  So I still think that that is the establishment game plan.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  That's why we started StopTheSteal.org, the rally in March,
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  which is now scheduled for July 18th.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  We have received our permit from the city of Cleveland.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  We have a number of cosponsors beyond StopTheSteal, including citizens for Trump,
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  women for Trump, bikers for Trump, veterans for Trump,
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  and wewillwalk.org.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  So the list of cosponsors for the rally, a peaceful, nonviolent rally
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  where the object is numbers.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  Let us show the Republican establishment our grassroots.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  Everybody's got a book to be there now.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  This is history.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  I'm going to be there.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  Be speaking.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  Roger Stone, you need to be part of this, folks, to stand up for free speech,
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  for the voting, for all of it, and expanding on this.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  You've always got big breaking news.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  You've always got inside baseball tidbits.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  Give us a bone.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  What's coming up in the next few days, the next few weeks?
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  What else should we be watching for?
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  Well, Indiana is crucial.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  Even in my most conservative count, and I'm keeping my own kind of private count,
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  I currently have Donald Trump worst case at 1250.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  And I know that the Republican national chairman, who I think is kind of playing a double game,
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  where he is conciliatory to Trump and his campaign people in private,
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  but he is working behind the scenes against us.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  That's my opinion, by the way, not the official opinion of anyone else.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  But I do think that there is a need to show the politicians inside the hall
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  what they will be losing, the energy and the diversity that they will be losing
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  if they euker this nomination away from Donald Trump.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  So you're basically, and others warning them that, listen, Trump is going to win.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  He can destroy Hillary.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  What are you doing?
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  You're going to destroy yourself.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  Don't do this.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  Yeah, I mean, I think it is, look, I have suggested that we go to the delegate hotels.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  We've got a piece of the pledge.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  People from Pennsylvania go to the Pennsylvania delegate hotel.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  Track down your elected representatives and ask them to take the pledge.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  It's voluntary.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  They don't need to take it.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  They don't have to take it.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  But if they don't, then the media can ask them why the votes of the people.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  We're simply canvassing who's going to represent the people and who's going to steal it.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  First amendment, right of association, and that's why all these big channels are throwing
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  hissy fits claiming that you're a terrorist.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  Yeah, I know it's an absurdity.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  It's a classic example of a mainstream media mugging where CNN took a bite out of context.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  They played my entire spot.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  Even they would have seen that I renounced violence.
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  I'm a veteran of the 1958 Nixon campaign.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  I saw what violence did to Hubert Humphrey's campaign, and therefore I think the greater
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  You've never promoted it.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  You've never promoted it.
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  And it's pure horse manure.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  It's the left running around beating people up and shooting cops in the back of the head.
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  Well, and the irony here, of course, is that those who are coming to Cleveland for violence
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  are the paid educators from moveon.org and Black Lives Matter and other lefty Clinton
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  supporting Soros funded groups.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  They're there to provoke violence, to incite violence, and then the mainstream media will
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  falsely blame that.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  That's right.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  Stay there.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  Let's talk about the Soros false flag.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  Straight ahead and take phone calls with Roger Stone on the road joining us.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  Your phone calls, straight ahead, Rob, Adrian, Jeffrey, Jerry, James, Sean.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:30:07.000]  Al Capone was not jailed for racketeering or corruption.
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000]  He was jailed for income tax evasion.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.000]  Now one of the longest serving leaders of organized crime, House Speaker Dennis Hastert
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000]  is going to jail for a financial crime that is no crime at all.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:23.000]  Hastert had been a serial sex abuser of minors before he became one of the untouchables.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:28.000]  He went on to become a leader of the racketeering group commonly known as the Congress.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  The type of operation he used was one they knew best, extortion.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  He was chosen to be leader of the GOP precisely because he could be controlled via blackmail.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:42.000]  Because of the statute of limitations, Hastert will not be punished for the documented cases
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000]  of abusing at least five minors.
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:49.000]  Instead, he will be punished for withdrawing his own cash from his own bank account.
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000]  Our government doesn't punish real crime.
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000]  Instead, it creates legal structures that they can use to entrap people who don't harm anyone.

[02:59:51.000 --> 03:00:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:01:00.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  You think all these globalists are smarter than you?
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000]  They got all the answers?
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  They're a bunch of scum.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  They do these evil things they do.
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  They're twisted.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:19.000]  When good people get off the bench, nothing can stop them.
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  Not long term.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  Evil fears us.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  That's why they poison our water and our food and our culture.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  Attack our fathers and our mothers.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  That's why they try to make us poor.
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  That's why they sell us lottery tickets.
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  Red dye number five soda pop to turn your kids into demons.
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  Because they fear you.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  But that that doesn't kill us and it sure killed a lot of us.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  Only makes us stronger.
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  And here's the good news.
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  The signal's already been sent.
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  This is the enemy's already launched a global collapse,
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  like a tsunami that happened in an earthquake across the Pacific Ocean.
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  It'll take two weeks to come across.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  Metaphorically.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  Our resistance has already won giant battles that we're already seeing
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  the reverberations of, but the big shock waves,
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  the big 200 megaton bombs we detonated inside the globalist operation
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  is just a white flash on the horizon.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  Because light travels faster than sound.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  It travels at the speed of light.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  But coming is the shock wave.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  That's not hype. That's reality.
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  But evil can't help it.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  It wants to take over.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  It's got to tell you you're worthless.
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  It's got to tell you you can't fight back
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  because it knows you hold the keys to the kingdom.
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000]  Right up here.
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  And in your heart, in your gut.
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  We got a lot of phones here.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  And I know good and well that David and I is going to take your calls
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  and ask you. I'm sure he will.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  He's got a big show lined up for you.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  But to Joshua and Sean and Mel and Kim,
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  Mel's in Costa Rica.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  I should go to them first and go to break it in this transmission
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:10.000]  where I'm hosting.
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  Mel in Costa Rica, thank you for holding her on the ear.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  Yes, Mr. Jones, can you hear me?
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  Yes, sorry you couldn't get the stone.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  But I tell you, I love taking calls.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  You guys brought up better questions than I did.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  You know, I'll tell you, Mr. Jones,
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  it's time for the Info Warriors to turn up the heat
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  and we all got to think way outside the box
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  and make sure that Hillary Clinton never sees that White House.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  And I came up with an idea that I think is explosive on a level
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  that it would be equivalent to dropping 29 Hiroshima bombs
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  on the political establishment.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  Okay, listen to me very carefully.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  If you could pull this off, my friend,
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000]  my hat is off to you.
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  Get Matt Drudge on your show to interview Mr. Trump.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  Reason being simple.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  Mr. Trump has mentioned Matt Drudge at least a dozen times
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  on his speeches in his campaign trail.
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  No, it's sensational.
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  I come in here, it's in my studio.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  I'm not even here.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  Or I'm in the control room, I get one question.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  And then Matt Drudge interviews Donald Trump.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  Sensational.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  Because the fusion, the media would attack it because it's my show,
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  which is great.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  They still think they're the establishment,
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000]  and it's great to be anti-establishment.
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  It's Drudge that nobody ever sees, but he's actually seen,
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  hadn't been seen in like a decade or almost, you know, in person.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  Even with his interview here, he did it in the shadows.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  And then Donald Trump, that is, or even if he doesn't do it here,
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  Matt Drudge interviews Donald Trump.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  Guaranteed it'll happen instantly if Drudge will do it.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  Trump will do it.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  Drudge might not.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  I never even call Matt Drudge.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  But I'm going to, I don't want to bug him.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  I think I'm going to call him.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  He's probably watching right now.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  But that is a genius idea.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  Maybe he'll put the question up on Drudge.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  You know, Drudge interviews Trump?
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000]  I don't know.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  Yeah!
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  I love the humor out of our audience.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:00.000]  Mel, congratulations.
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:03.000]  The Untouchable.
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  Al Capone was not jailed for racketeering or corruption.
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:09.000]  He was jailed for income tax evasion.
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:12.000]  Now one of the longest serving leaders of organized crime,
[03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  House Speaker Dennis Hastert is going to jail
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:18.000]  for a financial crime that is no crime at all.
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  Hastert had been a serial sex abuser of minors
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  before he became one of the Untouchables.
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:26.000]  He went on to become a leader of the racketeering group,
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000]  commonly known as the Congress.
[03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:31.000]  The type of operation he used was one they knew best,
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:32.000]  extortion.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:35.000]  He was chosen to be leader of the GOP precisely because
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000]  he could be controlled via blackmail.
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  Because of the statute of limitations,
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  Hastert will not be punished for the documented cases
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000]  of abusing at least five minors.
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  Instead, he'll be punished for withdrawing his own cash
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000]  from his own bank account.
[03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:52.000]  Our government doesn't punish real crime.
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  Instead, it creates legal structures that they can use
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000]  to entrap people who don't harm anyone.
[03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:03.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000]  No one has put together a formula
[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:08.000]  that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:14.000]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ,
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000]  is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:19.000]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:36.000]  The brand-new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:39.000]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants
[03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000]  while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  This new four-stage filtration process
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  helps protect the largest organ in your body,
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:48.000]  your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[03:06:58.000 --> 03:06:59.000]  from ProPure today.
[03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:02.000]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000]  RobDoo joins us.
[03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours.
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:08.000]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:09.000]  I'd been working all day.
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  I get in here at 8.30.
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000]  I was kind of run down.
[03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it,
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000]  I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later,
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:26.000]  it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000]  Read about it. Find out why.
[03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:33.000]  Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:36.000]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000]  that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000]  but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:46.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:49.000]  got up, took two more Brainforce, and came in.
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:52.000]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products
[03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:59.000]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:30.000]  On this Wednesday, April 27, 2016, fourth hour, I'm David Knight.
[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  Well, we have some interesting developments after last night.
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  You know, in my opinion, in a lot of people's opinion,
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  Ted Cruz has always been constitutionally ineligible for presidency.
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  Now he is mathematically ineligible.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:46.000]  We've got two choices here before us today.
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  We've got either Donald Trump or Don Coyote.
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  That's what I tweeted out last night.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:55.000]  The reality hasn't set in for Ted Cruz,
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  or his supporters like Mark Levin.
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  Look at the difference that we're hearing from them
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  from just a couple of weeks ago when Ted Cruz won a primary in Wisconsin.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  And of course, you know when you win Wisconsin.
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  That's kind of like winning Washington, D.C.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  Wisconsin is the GOP RNC headquarters.
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  That's where Paul Ryan and Ryan Spribus and the Scott Walker machine
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  are all located along with their network of local talk radio places.
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  So when you win that, that wasn't, as Mark Levin said,
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:28.000]  a crushing victory for Cruz and a crushing defeat for Donald Trump.
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  No, that's the way he put it.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  And he said at the time, he said,
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  well, there's no expectation that Ted Cruz is going to win in New York,
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:38.000]  although he can do better in New York now.
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  Yeah, well, he got in third place out of three.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:46.000]  And he had an average last night of just under 15%.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  Okay, but that doesn't stop him.
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:52.000]  Doesn't stop his loyal supporters like Glenn Beck or Mark Levin.
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  Let's take a look at some of the numbers and where we stand now.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:58.000]  1237, the magic number.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  There are 616 delegates remaining.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  As we stand right now,
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  Donald Trump needs to get only 46% of the remaining delegates.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  Ted Cruz, however, needs to get 110% of the remaining delegates.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:16.000]  And John Kasich needs 176.
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  I think he's going to go for 200.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  Pretty soon he's going to need 200% of the remaining delegates.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  This is the common core math that Ted Cruz and his die-hard supporters
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  with Glenn Beck and Mark Levin are telling us, okay?
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  They're telling us in their common core math
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  that winning one state, coming up, everything is all it.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  Don't pay any attention to what happened in the Northeast.
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  You know, we had a run of six states for Donald Trump.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  That's not important.
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:47.000]  What's important is Indiana, okay?
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  So one state is more important than six.
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  Well, you know, it could be if it was a big state like California,
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:56.000]  but they keep telling us that it's all about the delegates, don't they?
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  So what Ted Cruz and company are telling us is that 172,
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  which is the number of delegates that were up for grabs with these six states,
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  172 delegates is greater than 57.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  That's common core math, folks.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  Or if you want to put all six of them together with New York,
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  267 delegates is not as important as 57 delegates.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  That's the way they're going to spend this in their desperation,
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  in their quixotic quest that they will not give up.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  It is absolutely incredible to me that they won't give up on this.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  Now, all of the delegates from yesterday have not been allocated.
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:44.000]  I think it's important to note that Donald Trump won every county of every state yesterday.
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  Let me say that again.
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  He won every county of every state.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  Now, whether or not you like him, that's the reality, okay?
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  Let's get real here.
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:56.000]  Now, in Pennsylvania, there's 71 delegates that are up,
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  but only 17 of them go to the person that the voters pick.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  Then they have this little game, okay?
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  You win every county of every state, five, six states, okay?
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  You still have to play these little delicate games that the GOP is doing.
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  It's kind of like, you know, mother may I?
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  Oh, you didn't say mother may I go to the back of the line, okay?
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:18.000]  That's the kind of games the GOP plays,
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  because as they pointed out in Colorado,
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  when our reporters, Rob Dew, went there, talked to the people
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  that had been at the Colorado, quote-unquote, election without voters,
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  Ted Cruz says, hey, we had 60,000 people vote.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:34.000]  Oh, you're real, really?
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000]  And you had voted on who?
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  Okay, you voted on people that got up and had 10 seconds to talk about
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  whether or not for a particular candidate,
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  but they played those kinds of games in Colorado.
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  And this one guy said, hey, I've been coming to these things for decades.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  I've never seen anything as stupid as this.
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  I've never seen anything like this.
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:54.000]  Another lady said, I asked one of the GOP establishment,
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:56.000]  why did you do it this way?
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  Nobody knew about this.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000]  Very few people knew about this.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  Only 60,000 people in Colorado.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:03.000]  That's pretty small.
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  And he goes, well, we don't want the wrong people to show up.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  They don't want the wrong people to vote.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  They don't want you to know who you're voting for.
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  So on the Pennsylvania ballot,
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  you've got these people at the top that you do know,
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  like Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  But at the bottom, you've got all these other names that you don't know
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  that are different in every district.
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  And you're not allowed to know who they're loyal to either,
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  because that would mess up the establishment game, wouldn't it?
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  Here's the interesting thing, though, okay?
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  So Donald Trump wins by a huge margin in Pennsylvania.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  He got between like 58 and 67% in the state yesterday.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  And I don't remember which one Pennsylvania was.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  But anyway, he won 17 delegates
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  because he overwhelmingly had a landslide in the popular vote.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:52.000]  And yet these 54 delegates are still available.
[03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  The interesting thing, I think, though,
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  is that of those 54, 39 of them told ABC News
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:02.000]  they will support Trump on the first ballot
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  of the Republican Convention.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  Now, he didn't get all of them,
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  but he got the vast majority of those, okay?
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  That's about 80% of the people who are remaining there.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  So even that little game is not working too well for them anymore.
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:17.000]  Now, Ted Cruz is going to make a major announcement today.
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  So that's a couple of hours ago.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:20.000]  And I thought, wow, is he coming to his senses?
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:22.000]  Is he going to say, you know what, folks,
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  I need 110% of the delegates remaining,
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:28.000]  even in my mind, I can't do that, okay?
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  No, the Canadian didn't do that.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  He didn't come to his senses.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  No, he is playing the political equivalent of fantasy football, okay?
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  He's picking all the players for his fantasy administration,
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000]  for his fantasy presidential campaign
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  that ain't going to happen, Ted, okay?
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  Now, it's interesting to me that he's going to pick Carly Fiorina
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  because remember they said that as people were speculating,
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  what's going on?
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  And this is a couple of hours ago.
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  They said, well, an aide to Carly Fiorina
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  confirmed that Fiorina was being vetted by the Cruz campaign.
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  Vetted.
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  Well, I would have thought maybe they might have vetted her last summer
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  when a Cruz Super PAC that spent a total of $536,000 for the quarter
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  three months spent $500,000 of the $536,000 they spent,
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  $500,000 of it went to Carly Fiorina in her campaign.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  And the FEC said, what's going on?
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  Would you send us a letter explaining this to us?
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  And as I've said, I would like to see that explanation
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  because it makes absolutely no sense to me at all.
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  And if you're going to pick a woman because you've got problems with women
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  and that's the real issue, or I'll talk about that in just a second.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  If you're going to pick a woman, like we're saying,
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  why would you pick Hillary Clinton?
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  Or why would you pick Carly Fiorina?
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:55.000]  We have a lot of women in this country who could do the job
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:56.000]  and do it really well.
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:58.000]  But not those two folks.
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:15:59.000]  Not those two.
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  Not Hillary, not Carly.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  When Carly was CEO of HP, which is her big resume issue, okay?
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:09.000]  You know the Peter principle where you keep going up and up and up
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:12.000]  until you get to a level of incompetency and fail?
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:15.000]  That's her HP CEO job.
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  When she was a CEO at HP, the stock fell like it was a Greek bank, okay?
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  You know, the Greek banks, when they had to close them all last summer,
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  wasn't it last summer?
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  Maybe, I think it was last summer, not two years ago.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  They had to close all the Greek banks and their stocks tanked, 50%, 60%.
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  That's what Carly Fiorina did for Hewlett Packard.
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  Here's what the issue is for Ted Cruz and why he's doing this,
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  engaging in his fantasy football league issue picks, okay?
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  There was something that came out just before the primary yesterday.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:48.000]  From Brown University, they did a poll.
[03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:54.000]  They found that in Rhode Island, 90% of the female voters rejected Senator Ted Cruz.
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:58.000]  He was doing the worst of any candidate, Republican or Democrat, with women.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:02.000]  We keep hearing from people saying, oh, you know, women hate Ted, Donald Trump.
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:05.000]  No, they hate Ted Cruz, especially in Rhode Island.
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:10.000]  90% of the female voters rejected Ted Cruz, okay?
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:16.000]  And remember that in these elections, not only did Trump win every county and every state,
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:20.000]  when you look at these demographics, especially places like Rhode Island,
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.000]  he won every demographic.
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  And I'm not talking about just male and female things like that.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:28.000]  No, when they broke people down and said, what are your political stances?
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:30.000]  Are you very conservative?
[03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  Are you conservative?
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000]  Are you moderate, okay?
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  He won all of those, and he won the very conservative and the conservative people
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:42.000]  more than he did the moderates even, Donald Trump did.
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  And so what do the cruisers say?
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000]  Oh, one other issue as well, okay?
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000]  This is something that happened in March 30th.
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  This is about a month old.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.000]  Ted Cruz launches a women's coalition, okay?
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:55.000]  It's part of his feud with Trump.
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  He was trying to portray Trump as anti-woman.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:00.000]  So he's going to portray himself as pro-women.
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  So he gets his Goldman Sachs wife, okay?
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:08.000]  I guess we could call her a Goldman Sachs.
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:13.000]  And he gets Carly Fiorina, and they create a women's coalition.
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  It hasn't worked out too well because after that women's coalition,
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:21.000]  a month later, he still had 90% of the female voters rejecting Ted Cruz.
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  So now he's going to pick Carly Fiorina as his VP.
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  He had women for Cruz.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:30.000]  It's a small group, his wife and Carly,
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:34.000]  who got a half a million dollars from one of his super PACs, okay?
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:36.000]  So this is where he is.
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  Now, we're hearing from the Mark Levennes and the talking points
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  that the Glen Becks and the Mark Levennes are saying,
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  is that this doesn't matter.
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:45.000]  This is the Northeast.
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:48.000]  And even though they have all these delegates or anything,
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  he's not going to win these states.
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  So what do you want?
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  You want a candidate who can't win the South like Ted Cruz?
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  You want a candidate who can't win the Northeast like Ted Cruz?
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:19:00.000]  You want a candidate who has only won some caucuses in the Midwest
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:02.000]  and one or two primaries?
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:03.000]  I don't think so.
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:06.000]  I think you want a candidate who can play nationally.
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:11.000]  I think you want a candidate who can take it to the base of his opponent,
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  the Northeast, into California.
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000]  And of course, that's the key.
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  Coming up is California.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:20.000]  So when we look at the numbers of this,
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  it really, really doesn't make sense.
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  Now, we're going to come up to a commercial break here.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  When we come back, I'm going to spend some time on Donald Trump's
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:33.000]  America First form policy because I think what he said
[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  and what people say about it is very instructive.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  We're also going to take a look at the Dennis Haster thing.
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:42.000]  We've been playing the Untouchables theme with that.
[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  The fact that he is going to jail for 15 months, I think, is an outrage.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:50.000]  Not because he's going to jail for 15 months.
[03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:53.000]  Now, he should go to jail for much, much longer than that
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:54.000]  for the crimes that he did against minors.
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  No, he's not going to jail for that.
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:58.000]  He's going to jail for financial crimes.
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:06.000]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:10.000]  of how select quote goes to bat for you by interim life insurance.
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:18.000]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:20.000]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:24.000]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:26.000]  price competitive companies we represent,
[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:36.000]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes,
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:44.000]  How about you?

[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  Why do this?
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:39.000]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:40.000]  The answer is simple.
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:44.000]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless.

[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:11.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:15.000]  I'm David Knight and we're going to go to some of the callers that wanted to talk to Roger Stone.
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:18.000]  Still on the line, we've got Joshua and Kim.
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  Hang on the line, I'm going to go to you in just one moment.
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  Before I do, I want to let you know about our new sale on Infowars Select Storeable Food, 30 to 40% off.
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  It's a huge discount on storeable food.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:36.000]  And again, when we say it's storeable, it is storeable for 25 years.
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  That's the shelf life.
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:40.000]  First quality food, first quality packaging.
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  And of course, it comes in resealable bags that you can reseal once you open it up.
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:48.000]  That's not going to maintain the 25 year freshness at that point.
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  But until you unseal it, you can keep it on your shelf for 25 years.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:54.000]  All of it, made in America.
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  Top notch, select storeable food you can get right now, 30 to 40% off.
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  Save yourself from price increases, not only on storeable food, but on real food.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  By taking advantage of this while we have this in stock, while this special is going on.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  We also have Anthroplytes back in stock.
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  And you can make sure that you don't run out of any of our products by signing up for auto-ship.
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  You can get 10% off anything that you schedule.
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  Pick the frequency at which you want to reship the quantity and the frequency.
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:26.000]  We want to make this a win-win situation.
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:31.000]  So we offer you a discount of 10% when you help us to manage our inventory.
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  So you can make sure you never run out of stock on the products that you use.
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:38.000]  And we have Anthroplytes now back in stock for anyone who wants to try that.
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  Anyone who wants to sign up for auto-ship.
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:45.000]  Now going to our callers, let's go to Joshua in Georgia.
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  Joshua, thank you for holding.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  Yes, thank you, David, for taking my call.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  Long time listener.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  God bless you guys for everything that you're doing.
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  Thank you.
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:56.000]  I have a quick question.
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:00.000]  Actually two questions, but the first one transitions to the second.
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:04.000]  On NBC the other day, Donald Trump was being interviewed in the morning in New York.
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:06.000]  And there was a question that was asked.
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  I was a little bit thrown off by it.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  I have a friend of mine who is a Ted Cruz supporter.
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:13.000]  He gave this to me and said, explain this about Donald Trump.
[03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  And that's what I was going to ask Roger Stone.
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:19.000]  And the question was, do you plan on raising taxes on the rich?
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  And Donald Trump did actually respond.
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  Yes, I do, including myself.
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  And there was no real explanation on that.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  I wasn't sure if there was anything that could be expanded upon to make that more clear.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  Well, you know, I'm not going to try to defend every policy that Donald Trump did.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  I am not going to defend every policy that anybody puts out there.
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  And quite frankly, if you're talking about increasing taxes,
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:44.000]  we need to go back and look at it because Donald Trump is saying,
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  hey, we need to look at what's going on with NAFTA.
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  That's a bad deal.
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  We're losing a lot of money and we need to renegotiate or abort that.
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:27:00.000]  Remember that the income tax came in and they took down tariffs to try to equal that out back in 1913.
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:06.000]  If we want an America first tax system, I think we need to go back to the tax system
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:10.000]  that Thomas Jefferson instilled in his first administration.
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:12.000]  He did and he talked about this.
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:14.000]  Look at his second inaugural address.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  Thomas Jefferson said, by eliminating useless offices,
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:22.000]  I have been able to eliminate all internal taxes.
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:28.000]  So you can ask what labor, what farmer, what mechanic knows the tax man?
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  Nobody, okay?
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  The government brought down to its constitutional size can be run off of tariffs.
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  And that's the way we ought to do it.
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  Wow, that's protectionism, they say. No, it's not.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  And it's no more protectionism than we should have.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:46.000]  I think that's the way that we ought to run our tax system.
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  I'm not really interested in what any of these candidates have to say about the income tax.
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:56.000]  This happens, all they ever talk about in the debates, Joshua, is they'll ask them,
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  what rates do you want to have and what are your different brackets?
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  And you know what?
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  That is just simply rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  So I don't really care when they talk about that.
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  Donald Trump says he wants to raise taxes on the rich.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:12.000]  The rich aren't going to pay any taxes.
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:13.000]  We've seen that.
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  When they put in the income tax in 1913, it started at 1%.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:25.000]  And 99% of Americans didn't pay any income tax the way they had the brackets set up.
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:30.000]  We need to get back to a system where we get rid of the income tax completely, okay?
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  We can do that.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:35.000]  We only need to reduce the government to the size that it was about five or six years ago.
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  That's something that Harry Brown pointed out when he ran for president as a libertarian.
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  He said, could you live with a government that was the size it was five or six years ago
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:45.000]  if you had no income tax?
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:48.000]  Could you, Joshua?
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:50.000]  Yeah, no, I understand.
[03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  And I wanted to ask the second question, and I'm actually glad I'm asking you, David.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:58.000]  I'm very educated on history and these matters.
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:02.000]  The next question I had is concerning our U.S. military.
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  I believe it's going to be night and day differences.
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:14.000]  If we see Hillary as president versus Donald Trump as president, what is your gut tell you concerning the direction of our militaries going to consider?
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  And Obama's been shrinking it massively.
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000]  There's really no solid direction that I've seen.
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  Obviously, they're trying to expand wars and shrink our military, which is detrimental to the country.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  I'm glad you asked that, Joshua.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  We're going to talk about that when we come back.
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  We're going to look at what Donald Trump said about his America First foreign policy.
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  Can you imagine if we would have a foreign policy that would put America first?
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  You know, that was our first American foreign policy to put America first.
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:42.000]  We'll talk about that when we come back. Thank you, Joshua.
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:58.000]  Yeah, say where this came. I'll get back to you as well.
[03:30:12.000 --> 03:30:18.000]  House Speaker Dennis Hastert is going to jail for a financial crime that is no crime at all.
[03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:23.000]  Hastert had been a serial sex abuser of minors before he became one of the untouchables.
[03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:28.000]  He went on to become a leader of the racketeering group commonly known as the Congress.
[03:30:28.000 --> 03:30:32.000]  The type of operation he used was one they knew best, extortion.
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:37.000]  He was chosen to be leader of the GOP precisely because he could be controlled via blackmail.
[03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:44.000]  Because of the statute of limitations, Hastert will not be punished for the documented cases of abusing at least five minors.
[03:30:44.000 --> 03:30:49.000]  Instead, he'll be punished for withdrawing his own cash from his own bank account.
[03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:52.000]  Our government doesn't punish real crime.
[03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:57.000]  Instead, it creates legal structures that they can use to entrap people who don't harm anyone.
[03:30:57.000 --> 03:31:07.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:37.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:43.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:45.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:51.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:59.000]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.

[03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:10.000]  I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work by Info.
[03:32:10.000 --> 03:32:11.000]  Thank you, brother.
[03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:12.000]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:18.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:20.000]  Welcome to the Infowars.
[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:30.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Mason, iodine.
[03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:32.000]  Right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[03:32:32.000 --> 03:32:35.000]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:36.000]  What products are you taking?
[03:32:36.000 --> 03:32:42.000]  Everything from SuperMail to Brain Force to Winter Sun X2.
[03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:48.000]  Even got a little DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[03:32:48.000 --> 03:32:53.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourselves.
[03:32:53.000 --> 03:33:19.000]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:28.000]  While our Joshua from Georgia had a question directly related to this.
[03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  What do we see happening with the military if Hillary Clinton were to win or if Donald Trump were to win?
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:37.000]  Well, I think we can get some insights based on what he has to say here today.
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:40.000]  But before we do that, Kim's been waiting a long time.
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:45.000]  Kim from Wisconsin, I believe. Go ahead, Kim. Give us your question.
[03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:49.000]  If a plane does not fly, it cannot spread poison.
[03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  If your boss is bad, he can be fired.
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:55.000]  If there are gunner and tanks under the ground, do not let them out.
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:59.000]  It is time to arrest them. Why would we let them continue?
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  To let them continue, is that not insanity?
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:08.000]  Yeah, I think it is. But the question is how do we do that?
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:13.000]  How do we do that? Do we grab guns and do we march into the Capitol Building and start shooting?
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  Because if we do that, we lose the moral high ground, don't we?
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:19.000]  We've got four boxes that we can use.
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:24.000]  One of them is the cartridge box. But before we use that, we need to use the soap box.
[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:30.000]  We need to use the ballot box. And most importantly, the one that I think is the most neglected is the jury box.
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:34.000]  One of the things that we can do is, first of all, play defense
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  and make sure that we don't allow our fellow citizens to be locked up for non-crimes,
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:42.000]  whether it's at the state, local or federal level.
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:47.000]  Okay, the other thing that we need to do is we need to, as you're doing right now,
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  get on a soap box. We need to educate each other.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:54.000]  Because until we have a critical mass, it's not going to work to use force.
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:59.000]  And I think once we have a critical mass, I don't think you're going to need the ballot box.
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:05.000]  We need to keep that in reserve. I think it's there as a threat of mutual destruction,
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  you know, in the same way that we had nuclear weapons.
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  And fortunately, so far, we haven't used them. Of course, we're starting up the Cold War again.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:17.000]  That's what the criminals are trying to do. But in the first Cold War that we had,
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:22.000]  we were able to keep either side from firing because of the threat of mutual destruction.
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:25.000]  That is what the Second Amendment is about.
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:30.000]  I've been at many demonstrations where the protesters are exercising their first
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:34.000]  and their second amendment combined. We get called terrorists.
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:37.000]  We get called, some of us have been arrested.
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:40.000]  They've arrested a lot of people that were at the Bundy standoff.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:42.000]  They should not have been arrested.
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  But right now at this point, I think what we do is we have to have fully informed juries.
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  And we need to make sure that they get a jury trial.
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:58.000]  And if we got only one person in a jury trial, they could get these people out of jail eventually.
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:02.000]  And now they're being held for an inordinately long amount of time.
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:08.000]  But I don't know, what would you want to do? How would you arrest people for treason?
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  Once you start naming names that you're going to arrest or simply arrest one of them,
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:19.000]  I think the rest would fall and crumble. I don't think they're real men.
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:26.000]  I think they would just, I think, and the others would also turn on them instantly.
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  I think their whole deck of cards would crumble.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:36.000]  Well, that's true. I think that though, I mean, we look at somebody who is a war criminal like Henry Kissinger.
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:39.000]  He was just here in Austin yesterday.
[03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  Henry Kissinger is still going around giving speeches and pontificating about world government.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  This is a guy who is a recognized war criminal.
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  He has to avoid going to certain countries because he'll be arrested in some countries.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:57.000]  So, you know, it is a troubling situation to see criminals walking about freely.
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:00.000]  And we're going to talk about Dennis Hastert in a moment.
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:03.000]  But I wish I had a better answer for you.
[03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  I know that we can't do that unilaterally. I know that we've got to get a mass of people together.
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  And I have some optimism that people are starting to wake up to the games that are being played with the electoral system,
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:19.000]  with the ballot box on both the Democrat side and the Republican side.
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:22.000]  But we need to keep people focused on liberty.
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  And sometimes the best thing you can do is to focus on the positive aspects.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.000]  And I think other things will start to fall into place.
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  Counterfeit money for many years until they started changing the currency so rapidly.
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:40.000]  What they would do to teach bank tellers how to spot the bad criminal counterfeit money is they would show them what a real bill looked like.
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  And I know it's not a real bill. I know it's coming from the Federal Reserve.
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:47.000]  But they would show them what a real Federal Reserve note looked like, if you will.
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:55.000]  And once they knew that, once they really had that burned into their mind and they could feel that and they knew what it looked like,
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  then when they saw the counterfeit, they knew it immediately.
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:03.000]  Our goal, and this is where we're so far away from doing anything,
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  right now the American people value the counterfeit of safety more than they do liberty.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:14.000]  They desire their rulers to hand them safety.
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:17.000]  They're not even asking for liberty.
[03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  Once we realize what the authentic thing is, once we realize the principle that people built this country on is liberty,
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  then we'll have an opportunity to do some real reform because then people start looking for the mechanisms by which they can get free,
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:35.000]  not clamoring for safety from their masters.
[03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:37.000]  And that's what we have right now.
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  Right now we have the mindset of a slave and until we focus on liberty, we're never going to arrest these people.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:44.000]  We're never going to lose that mindset of slavery.
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  Thank you, Kim. I want to go and I want to finish the answer that I started to give to Joshua and I didn't have time.
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:56.000]  And I think that is found, he said, what's going to happen? What's the military going to look like under these different presidents?
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  Or what's our foreign policy going to look like?
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:01.000]  And we had Donald Trump make a foreign policy speech today.
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:04.000]  And I'll start here with this characterization.
[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:06.000]  It's a quote that was on the BBC.
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  Aaron David Miller, they say he's a former adviser to Republican Democrat administrations.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  This is the way he characterized Donald Trump's foreign policy speech.
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:23.000]  He said it was a perfect storm of isolationism, muscular nationalism, with a dash of pragmatism and realism.
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:27.000]  I looked at that and I thought, is he being critical?
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:32.000]  I mean, I look at that as like, I think that's great.
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:37.000]  When they say isolationism, remember that when Donald Trump repeats the phrase America first,
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  we're going to put America first, we're going to put America's interests first.
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:45.000]  That was America's first foreign policy.
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:49.000]  Our first foreign policy was what George Washington articulated when he said,
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  we're going to stay clear of perpetual wars in Europe.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  We're going to stay clear of entanglements with foreign countries.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:02.000]  That was our first American policy and it put America's interests first.
[03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  But now, that is considered to be isolationism.
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:06.000]  It's not isolationism.
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  No, we were for trade with people.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:12.000]  Okay, and that doesn't mean we let them manipulate currencies.
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  That doesn't mean that we let foreign multinational corporations manage our economy with a phony trade deal and call that free trade.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  No, it means real free trade.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  It means real free trade, not managed trade, not managed by multinational corporate lobbyists.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  So, you know, they want to call that isolationism.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  No, it's true, genuine, authentic free trade, not the phony free trade that the GOP and the establishment leaders
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  of the Democrats are selling us as well.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:41.000]  We talk about muscular nationalism.
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:42.000]  What's wrong with that?
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:44.000]  What's wrong with pragmatism?
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  What's wrong with realism?
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:48.000]  You know, our foreign policy has not been pragmatic.
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  It has not been realistic.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  It's not been even legal.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  They talk about who is this foreign policy team?
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:58.000]  Well, they say the team is led by Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama,
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  who has helped to shape Mr. Trump's policies.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:02.000]  That's the BBC.
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  I think that's a great thing.
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:08.000]  Remember, it was Jeff Sessions, who, when he was talking to Leon Panetta,
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:15.000]  he's been CIA director, but he was also, at the time, he was defense secretary.
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  And he said, what are the conditions that you're going to commit the military?
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:22.000]  And Panetta says, well, we would talk to the UN.
[03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  We would talk to NATO.
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  And he goes, well, wait a minute.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:26.000]  You were a congressman once.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:27.000]  Don't you know what the Constitution says?
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  I can't believe what I'm hearing.
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:30.000]  You wouldn't consult Congress first?
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:34.000]  No, we would let you know what we decide to do after we talk to the UN,
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  after we talk to NATO, okay?
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  That man who has a problem with Leon Panetta, Senator Sessions,
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:47.000]  is now the main advisor to Donald Trump.
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:48.000]  That is great, I think.
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  He's the only presidential candidate that Jeff Sessions has ever endorsed.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:57.000]  And he's been working with him on these phony trade treaties.
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:42:02.000]  And working with him on defense and foreign policy issues since last summer.
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:05.000]  Now, let's talk about some of the things that Donald Trump said in his
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  America First foreign policy.
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  CNN and these people, they can't believe they put America First in quotes.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:14.000]  They say he's laid out his vision for a foreign policy that will put
[03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:19.000]  America First he's vowed to shake the rust off of America's foreign policy.
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  He says, my foreign policy will always put the interests of American people
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  and American security first.
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  See, CNN and the BBC and the GOP and Democrat establishment have a problem with that.
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  I don't have a problem with that.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:36.000]  That's what an American president ought to do.
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  He ought to put the interests of the American people first.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  And this is something that I think Donald Trump is authentic on.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:46.000]  He's been talking about this since the late 80s, early 90s.
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:48.000]  He went on to pan the Iran nuclear deal.
[03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:52.000]  A centerpiece of Obama's foreign policy claimed the president has, quote,
[03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  weakened our military by weakening our economy.
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:43:00.000]  Now, when Joshua from Georgia asked me what the military is going to look like
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  under Hillary Clinton or under Donald Trump.
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:08.000]  Let me tell you, Donald Trump understands that if you have a weak economy,
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  you're going to have a weak military.
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  If you have a weak economy, you're going to have a weak country in general.
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:22.000]  We have won every war since the Civil War by having an overwhelming capacity to wage war.
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  An overwhelming economy, that is a key component of victory.
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:34.000]  If you have a weak, ineffective, impotent economy, that's what you're going to have,
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:36.000]  an impotent military.
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  And so he understands this and that's why he says our NATO allies,
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:47.000]  our foreign allies in Asian countries are going to have to shoulder their load of the defense.
[03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  He's said this many times and he's made the point himself.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:54.000]  He said, look, if we're going to be in my term, I think you ought to use,
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  if we're going to be the unpaid mercenaries of the world,
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:00.000]  if we're going to be the world's policeman and not get paid for doing it,
[03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  I don't want America to be the world's policeman, okay?
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  But we certainly can't afford to do it if we are going to bear the financial burden as well.
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  And he says the reality of it is that if South Korea and Japan and countries who can afford to pay for their defense,
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  like European countries, if they don't pay for their defense, if we do it all,
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  we will eventually collapse and then they'll have to pay for their defense.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000]  But who will defend us?
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  Will the Saudis?
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  Will the Saudis defend us when our economy collapses, when our military subsequently collapses?
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  Of course they won't.
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  And then he goes on to start talking about Secretary of State Clinton and CNN says,
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:47.000]  well, he sought to wrap former Secretary of State Clinton in his criticism of the Obama administration.
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  Is that unfair?
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:55.000]  Is that unfair to include the Secretary of State and the foreign policy of Obama?
[03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:58.000]  Of course she should be included.
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  It's every much a part of her foreign policy as it is Obama.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  She was involved with the catastrophes that we've had in Libya and in Syria and other places, okay?
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:10.000]  She wants to take credit for being Secretary of State.
[03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  Let's give her the full credit for being Secretary of State.
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  Let's look at what she did as Secretary of State.
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:18.000]  Let's look at that very closely.
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:24.000]  And that's one of the reasons why many people on the left cannot support her.
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  It's because of what she did as Senator, for what she did as Secretary of State.
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:34.000]  So he referred to the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions.
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  Yes, and they have created weakness, confusion, and disarray.
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  Absolutely.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  Now he goes on to say he's going to be working very closely with our friends in the Muslim world,
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  which are all at risk for violent attacks, but he says they must also be good to us.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:51.000]  It is no longer going to be one way.
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:54.000]  It's going to be a two-way street.
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:45:59.000]  It goes on to say, and this is the take-home money quote, guys.
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:07.000]  He says, we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:09.000]  Yes.
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:10.000]  Let me repeat that again.
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:13.000]  Donald Trump said today in his America First Form policy,
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:29.000]  We will not turn them over to international agreements that tie us up and bring America down.
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:38.000]  Now, that should be pulled out and held up like a quote from Patrick Henry folks.
[03:46:38.000 --> 03:46:40.000]  That is a great quote.
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  We're not going to surrender our country to the song of globalism,
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:48.000]  to international agreements that tie us up and bring America down.
[03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:50.000]  I think he's authentic on that.
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  I disagree with Donald Trump's emphasis.
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:47:00.000]  As I said before, I think the purpose of the American government has to be to secure individual liberty.
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  But at the international level, and I really believe that that focus really should be done locally,
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:11.000]  and it has to be something that lives in the hearts of the American people.
[03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:14.000]  If we don't value liberty, we won't stand for it.
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:16.000]  We won't stand up for it.
[03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:23.000]  At the international level, what the central federal government was created for,
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  for foreign policy to protect this country from other countries,
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:31.000]  what we're talking about international trade, what we're talking about foreign policy,
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  what we're talking about when we're going to go to war and how we're going to fight that war,
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  that is something that truly is the responsibility of the American president.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:46.000]  And quite frankly, I haven't heard American president talk about these issues,
[03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  the false song of globalism, international agreements that tie us up and bring America down.
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:54.000]  That's better than Reagan, folks. A lot better than Reagan.
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  Reagan talked about individual liberty. He talked about freedom.
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  But he didn't talk about how we're being destroyed by globalism by international agreements.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  We have now seen in the intervening 40 years what that has done to us.
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:10.000]  And I think we need to do something about this.
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:12.000]  Now he goes on. I'll read you another couple of quotes here.
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:19.000]  come second to the citizens of a foreign country.
[03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:23.000]  He says, I will not send our finest into battle unless necessary.
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:32.000]  And I mean absolutely necessary. And I will do so only if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  I believe he would do that as well. Every politician says that.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:40.000]  But I believe that Donald Trump is authentic on that.
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:42.000]  Finally, I'll read you one more quote.
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:48.000]  We've been embroiled in several costly, protracted conflicts and the world has become more complex,
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:52.000]  more unstable, and more dangerous. Yes. Yes.
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  And Hillary Clinton's foreign policy has left us weak, confused, and in disarray.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:02.000]  That is a stark, clear difference between Donald Trump and the rest of the field.
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:08.000]  And I would include in the rest of the field people like Ted Cruz, who has just talked in generality.
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:12.000]  And I've not gotten any sense that he has an America first form policy.
[03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:18.000]  As a matter of fact, his wife, his globalist connections with the CFR has been working on the North American Union.
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:24.000]  He is a shell for the very people that Donald Trump is taking on with this foreign policy.
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:28.000]  Now, in the time I got left, I want to talk about Dennis Hastert.
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  Dennis Hastert was sentenced today to 15 months in prison in a hush money case.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:37.000]  Listen to the way the media is portraying this.
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  They say former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was sentenced Wednesday to 15 months in prison
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:45.000]  in his hush money case by a judge who called him a serial child molester
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:48.000]  and ordered him to enroll in a sex offender treatment program.
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  Folks, he's not going to jail because he is a child molester.
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  He should go to jail because he's a child molester.
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  We have a statute of limitations, unfortunately, on molesting children in this country.
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  And I don't know why we have that statute.
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:08.000]  One of the victims of this man who is now in his 50s, the victim is now in his 50s,
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:10.000]  he says, I wanted you, he testified there.
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  He said, I wanted you to know the pain and the suffering that he caused me then
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:17.000]  and still causes me, still causes me.
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  There is no statute of limitation on the suffering of the children.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  There should be no statute of limitation on prosecuting the criminals
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:30.000]  who cause that lifelong suffering.
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:32.000]  But unfortunately, there is.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  If you were to look at this, if you were to say that he's going to jail for 15 months,
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  we know at least five people on record that he abused, minors that he abused.
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:42.000]  So what is he getting?
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  Three months for each of these victims?
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:47.000]  Okay, but no, it's even worse than that.
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  He's not going to jail for a real crime.
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:53.000]  He's going to jail for a non-crime.
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  And we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  Stay with us.
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:02.000]  My name is Don Wiskins.
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:07.000]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:12.000]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:17.000]  In January of 1998, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:22.000]  Twenty-one days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  He waited too long.
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:26.000]  In June that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  What did I do?
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:31.000]  I took a seven-herb formula I now call Extendivite made from garlic, cayenne,
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:35.000]  bilberry, ginko, biloba, hotthorne, milk, thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:37.000]  Based on German studies of natural medicine,
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:41.000]  Extendivite is designed to clear block arteries, clean the toxin from your blood,
[03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  and improve your immune system.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:48.000]  To get your Extendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:54.000]  That's 1-877-928-8822, or visit our website, heartdrop.com.
[03:51:54.000 --> 03:52:17.000]  Extendivite with Extendivite.
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:52.000]  Extendivite with Extendivite.
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:53:21.000]  Extendivite with Extendivite.
[03:53:21.000 --> 03:53:47.000]  Extendivite with Extendivite.
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:54:11.000]  Extendivite with Extendivite.
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, April 27, 2016.
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  I'm David Knight, and we have one more segment to cover, and I want to finish talking about Dennis Hastert,
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:26.000]  and I want to talk about a hard lesson that has been learned by some Christians.
[03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:31.000]  You know, we say that experience is an expensive school, but it's the only one a fool will attend.
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:37.000]  Don't be fooled by the civil asset forfeiture laws that were put in place by the Reagan administration.
[03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:41.000]  I want to tell Christians, and this story from the Washington Post, exactly what happened to that.
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:49.000]  Before we go back to these two stories, I want to let you know about our sale that we have on select storable food at infoawardsstore.com.
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  You know, food prices are going up around the world.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  Now is the time to start getting prepared.
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:58.000]  These select foods have a shelf life of 25 years.
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:00.000]  They're all made in the USA.
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  You won't find any finer packaging than you have on the select storable food.
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  The unprecedented discount here 30 to 40% off the max you're going to see anywhere in terms of a discount right now.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  All select storable food 30 to 40% off at infoawardsstore.com while supplies last.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  Now to finish up on Dennis Hastert, as I said, it would be an absolute travesty of justice if this man were to only go to jail for 15 months
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  for abusing at least five people.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:36.000]  Okay, three months a person, these people have suffered their entire lives for this.
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:38.000]  But no, he's not being sent to jail for that.
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  And all the news articles make it sound like that's the case.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  Just as I said, well, the judge said, you're a serial child molester.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:47.000]  You need to get sex offender treatment.
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  Yeah, this treatment needs to be behind bars so he can't do it again.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  Because we have the statute of limitations, he's not going to jail for that.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  And because we have the statute of limitations, it allows people like pedophile priests to continue doing this.
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:06.000]  These serial child molesters and get away with it and avoid jail sentences.
[03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  How did they get to this Hastert?
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  Why is he going to jail for 15 months?
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  He's going to jail for a non-crime.
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  He's going to jail because he took his money out of his bank account and he did it in a way that it wouldn't get reported to the federal government.
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:23.000]  And they called that structuring.
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:28.000]  This was something that was set up first to look at deposits and say,
[03:56:28.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  we don't want drug dealers putting money in the bank and structuring their deposits so that it doesn't get noticed.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  Because they're going to report large deposits of cash into the bank to the federal government so they can look at you as a drug dealer.
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:48.000]  So they say, well, we don't want people to put it just under the limit of 10,000 or whatever.
[03:56:48.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  So if they make multiple deposits just under the limit so it doesn't get reported,
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:55.000]  we're going to say they're structuring those deposits.
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:57:00.000]  And there's been a lot of abuse of people who are small businesses who had no criminal actions,
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  had no intent to try to hide anything from the federal government as if they have a right to know what we're doing with our cash.
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:07.000]  They don't.
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:08.000]  And they've gone to jail.
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  And so now it's gotten to the absurd extreme that somebody who takes their own money,
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:18.000]  which has already been deposited, which has already been looked at, takes their money out as he was doing to pay off one of these guys' hush money,
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:20.000]  then he goes to jail for 15 months.
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  Now, talking about cash, if you have cash, of course, you are going to be a criminal.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  You're going to be the victim, I should say, of highway robbers, criminals that we call law enforcement officers in Oklahoma.
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:37.000]  This is a case that came out of Oklahoma, out of Muskogee County.
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:43.000]  And these oakes from Muskogee pull over a guy who had just finished a tour with a Christian ban,
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:45.000]  and he was taking the ban's proceeds.
[03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:49.000]  They had gone around 19 cities across the United States selling tickets,
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  taking money as a collection for a church for an orphanage back in Burma.
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:58:00.000]  They get pulled over, they get robbed, okay, by the police.
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:05.000]  And then the police come back and say, well, after it gets publicized by the Washington Post,
[03:58:05.000 --> 03:58:08.000]  after the Institute of Justice takes it up as a pro bono case,
[03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  they come back and say, well, we couldn't meet the burden of proof in the criminal case or the civil case,
[03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  so we're going to let you go.
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:16.000]  Look, there is no burden of proof of civil asset forfeiture.
[03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:22.000]  They try it as a civil case because they confiscate your money, make you sue them.
[03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:28.000]  And we have the Obama administration, which made a big deal about this saying they're going to reform it,
[03:58:28.000 --> 03:58:32.000]  and now they're coming in and doing deals with the police department,
[03:58:32.000 --> 03:58:34.000]  just like they did with the insider trading in Congress.
[03:58:34.000 --> 03:58:38.000]  Make a big deal of reform, then come back in, ignore it, and as business as usual.
[03:58:38.000 --> 03:59:07.000]  Join us tonight, 7 Central, 8 P.M. Eastern.
