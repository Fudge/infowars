[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:31.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.200 --> 00:47.440]  it's really been hitting me lately and hitting me hard really coming home that
[00:47.440 --> 00:53.920]  the status quo in the United States is the rapid descent into total lawlessness
[00:53.920 --> 01:00.160]  by select elite groups who are now officially above the law and who have
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.120]  high-tech systems of propaganda and manipulation to where the public is
[01:05.120 --> 01:10.120]  aware of the tyranny but they feel like they're all alone and basically adapt to
[01:10.120 --> 01:17.560]  being slaves and I was on man cow Muller's radio show today like I am
[01:17.560 --> 01:25.480]  pretty much every Wednesday and Thursday I come on about twice a week now and he
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.800]  was rattling off all these examples of tyranny and saying Obama's become
[01:29.800 --> 01:35.520]  a dictator which is stating the obvious but he was listening to someone else say
[01:35.520 --> 01:40.440]  it I just kept thinking what am I doing still in this country people always
[01:40.440 --> 01:44.080]  asked why did the Jews and others stay in Nazi Germany and I was just sitting
[01:44.080 --> 01:47.680]  there this morning while he was ranting for about five minutes he's even worse
[01:47.680 --> 01:51.280]  than I am about interrupting people that's why he's a lovable character but the
[01:51.280 --> 01:58.280]  point is is that my mind was clear and calm because I wasn't on air myself it's
[01:58.280 --> 02:01.200]  like you lose half your IQ once you're on air you're able to think about the
[02:01.200 --> 02:04.200]  camera and the microphone and what's going on and guess that are coming up
[02:04.200 --> 02:10.840]  and what's happening and phone numbers and all the clutter of the news that
[02:10.840 --> 02:18.360]  pretty much gets in the way almost as minutia of the fact that history 100%
[02:18.360 --> 02:26.240]  is repeating itself and going on a trajectory that is so premeditatedly
[02:26.240 --> 02:32.000]  destructive that I cannot believe the establishment is consciously doing this
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.760]  they have decided to be pure evil and they have decided to just go with total
[02:38.760 --> 02:46.680]  authoritarianism and poisoning the food the water I mean it's all real
[02:46.680 --> 02:53.320]  everything we've talked about has been wrong and by that it's worse than we
[02:53.320 --> 03:00.640]  said we've been incredibly accurate to a point and then wrong after that about
[03:00.640 --> 03:07.600]  just how bad these people are and how it's all planned out at the top and then
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.600]  they readjust things as they roll forward and once you study this in depth
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.480]  for a long time then it becomes absolutely clear how they're operating and
[03:16.480 --> 03:23.040]  then years later it comes out and we're totally right so I've been totally
[03:23.040 --> 03:32.560]  right to a point but then it's been so much worse than even I could imagine of
[03:32.560 --> 03:36.400]  the establishment and I know I got a lot of news I mean I mainly just get up
[03:36.400 --> 03:43.320]  here and Marvel now because Obama and the executive branch it doesn't mean
[03:43.320 --> 03:49.360]  Obama the person but but Obama the brand name Obama the front man Obama the
[03:49.360 --> 03:54.280]  divider Obama everything is about the skin color the opposite of what Reverend
[03:54.280 --> 04:00.480]  Martin Luther King said Obama is the great globalist wedge worldwide to sell
[04:00.480 --> 04:06.760]  the globalist empire in the name of America as we go bankrupt as the system
[04:06.760 --> 04:11.960]  absolutely butchers our way of life butchers our prosperity and prepares us
[04:11.960 --> 04:21.080]  for total bondage Obama the figurehead has turned the executive branch officially
[04:21.080 --> 04:30.400]  into a dictatorship and all the trappings if you judge tyranny by a meal
[04:30.400 --> 04:33.440]  that's been laid out on the table this is the greatest feast I could ever
[04:33.440 --> 04:40.160]  imagined or heard of thousands of dishes steaming with poison just so much
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.600]  corruption so many different corporations and teams working on deception
[04:44.600 --> 04:50.440]  fraud lies scams counterfeit currencies counterfeit systems it just boggles
[04:50.440 --> 04:56.160]  the mind this is evil unleashed we're gonna break it all down with huge

[05:03.480 --> 05:09.040]  our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in

[05:13.480 --> 05:18.160]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.960]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[05:22.960 --> 05:28.280]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[05:28.280 --> 05:33.320]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[08:16.880 --> 08:21.040]  GCN radio network
[08:25.960 --> 08:35.640]  if you'll remember back in January of this year about 11 months ago I was
[08:35.640 --> 08:45.280]  inside CNN headquarters there in New York City and there was evidence of rot
[08:45.280 --> 08:51.840]  decay demoralization and collapse everywhere and I came on air and I said
[08:51.840 --> 08:59.120]  CNN as it has been known is imploding is collapsing you notice now they're
[08:59.120 --> 09:04.520]  announcing they're basically going to paid programming with paid fake
[09:04.520 --> 09:11.680]  infomercial news that is fully funded by product placement and no one will tell
[09:11.680 --> 09:18.560]  you it's in the fine print was in the news yesterday and last week that CNN you
[09:18.560 --> 09:24.280]  can just type in CNN going to product placement news and you'll get mainline
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.000]  trade publications where it's going to be like infomercials and Discovery
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.720]  Channel and History Channel wrapped in with corporately sponsored fake news ABC
[09:35.720 --> 09:42.200]  NBC CBS the London Guardian which is actually a very journalistic outfit in
[09:42.200 --> 09:47.040]  many respects they have underwritten on articles about a third of them Bill
[09:47.040 --> 09:52.960]  and Melinda Gates Foundation that Warren Buffett's involved in so already the
[09:52.960 --> 10:00.680]  message is literally off the teleprompter are paid for by IBM by Microsoft by
[10:00.680 --> 10:06.480]  Apple by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation total social engineering but
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.400]  because no one's watching it anymore Obama is now saying I'm not even gonna
[10:11.400 --> 10:15.400]  have press conferences really or if I do we're not gonna have press pool there
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.920]  and you can't ask questions we'll have basically government employees ask
[10:19.920 --> 10:25.320]  questions just as FEMA got caught doing ten years ago and again last year fake
[10:25.320 --> 10:29.840]  reporters ladies and gentlemen they've come out really about five years ago
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.960]  but they declassified it last year most of the news you already see I want to
[10:34.960 --> 10:39.560]  give you a little inside scoop is written by think tanks then passed
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.720]  through the CIA and then put through computer programs that put fake
[10:44.720 --> 10:49.880]  reporter gnome de plume pen names on them and then they re-scramble it so
[10:49.880 --> 10:55.160]  that bots and systems can't tell that it's plagiarized so there it is CNN's
[10:55.160 --> 10:59.200]  Jeff Zucker reveals plans to change from news network into place with
[10:59.200 --> 11:06.400]  attitude that's how the Democratic front group puts it but again ladies and
[11:06.400 --> 11:11.040]  gentlemen this is what they're doing and this was all planned they're getting
[11:11.040 --> 11:15.720]  rid of journalism entirely first they bought off journalism corrupted it now
[11:15.720 --> 11:21.360]  they're getting rid of it entirely when it's too late and the CNN and MSNBC
[11:21.360 --> 11:26.360]  authoritarian traders are literally freaking out as they get their pay cut
[11:26.360 --> 11:33.040]  or they get their pink slips and then they're going to come in with the fairness
[11:33.040 --> 11:35.960]  doctrine on talk radio that's being announced and they're going to come in
[11:35.960 --> 11:42.880]  and using fake copyright rules and taxes and shut down the real media so the war
[11:42.880 --> 11:48.920]  is on it's an info war it's happening right now and they're coming after us
[11:48.920 --> 11:54.440]  behind the scenes across the board that's why you'll see patriot meetings on
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.920]  c-span or whatever and they'll at the end say and whatever you do don't listen to
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.880]  Jones he's disinfo with no proof and you'll turn on MSNBC and they'll say
[12:02.880 --> 12:09.320]  deeply racist behind terror bombings people say why but they killed me yet
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.000]  man cow was asking me that this morning well they're killing my name they
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.440]  are literally calling me a racist and a terrorist with no evidence they're having
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.160]  operatives in different liberty movement organizations which I expected it
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.720]  doesn't hurt me I'm ready to die for this folks I mean I know it's in the cards
[12:27.720 --> 12:31.680]  big time they might just set me up or kill me just I don't lose when that
[12:31.680 --> 12:37.440]  happens I did this willfully I want that on record you will not take my victory
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.640]  from me one way or the other it's on record I know the course I've steered
[12:41.640 --> 12:48.480]  into the flag storm over the target on purpose the enemies attacks are my
[12:48.480 --> 12:54.200]  guiding light my north star I go into the dragon's fire I go into the fiery
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.280]  furnace I go into the lion's den willfully consciously because it's the
[12:59.280 --> 13:04.920]  only course out of this system I don't do it because I want to I do it because
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.000]  I have to because I know there is no other course but in through and beyond I
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.480]  just want to point that out because I don't even monitor it but it's just
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.600]  flooding out all the operatives are decloaking opening fire and it's going
[13:17.600 --> 13:21.320]  to get much much worse ladies and gentlemen because we have the zeitgeist
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.320]  by the will of God we have people awakening to the truth we know the
[13:26.320 --> 13:30.200]  enemy program we've not been lazy we studied it and now everyone's seeing it
[13:30.200 --> 13:37.760]  manifest exactly as we told you it would manifest and so now the real attack
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.560]  upon everyone it's going to be attacks on info wars.com it's going to be a
[13:43.560 --> 13:47.400]  tax on places like worldnet daily.com drudge report.com there's going to be
[13:47.400 --> 13:53.280]  a massive attacks on Ron Paul Rand Paul Ted Cruz and it's not that any of us
[13:53.280 --> 13:57.080]  are perfect we're just men but the globalist have our phones tapped the
[13:57.080 --> 14:02.040]  globalist track what we do the globalist know we're for real anyone for real is
[14:02.040 --> 14:06.400]  going to be attacked you have to understand that ladies and gentlemen
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.080]  because we're here saying bill of rights constitution unity restore the
[14:11.080 --> 14:16.040]  republic restore due process restore the branches of government restore the
[14:16.040 --> 14:20.560]  republic there's been a revolution by offshore corporations to fully seize the
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.720]  federal government and set up a scientific multi-layered national
[14:25.720 --> 14:31.520]  stabilization force as ran corporation calls it that is a martial law grid on
[14:31.520 --> 14:39.320]  its face they had hearings two days ago in congress and the video is up on
[14:39.320 --> 14:46.920]  info wars.com right now Michael Cannon Kato Institute's director of health
[14:46.920 --> 14:50.240]  policy studies testified before a congressional committee about the
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.640]  dangers of the president's legal behavior and went on to say that the
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.720]  president is becoming a dictator and endangering an overthrow of the
[14:59.720 --> 15:04.560]  government now let's be clear the power structure that funds the republican
[15:04.560 --> 15:07.320]  leadership and the democratic leadership that's trying to kill the
[15:07.320 --> 15:11.240]  libertarian tea party because it's the only real opposition right now the
[15:11.240 --> 15:16.960]  entire power structure is lined up against us full power open fire blasting
[15:16.960 --> 15:22.040]  us right now you understand that as America collapses as the as the as the
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.160]  police state marches out as they shut down everything as they devalue the
[15:26.160 --> 15:32.120]  dollar as they try to open the borders completely America is literally on fire
[15:32.120 --> 15:38.360]  burning down right now it is Alamo level follow the Alamo collapse okay you
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.200]  need to understand that and we're just desperately trying to have a future for
[15:42.200 --> 15:45.720]  our children just saying Bill of Rights Constitution they're bankrupting us by
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.480]  design and it's just we're under total attack okay that's I'm just telling you
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.960]  right now ladies and gentlemen that's what this is it's all lining up for
[15:54.960 --> 15:59.440]  spectacular wars spectacular terrorist attacks real and staged
[15:59.440 --> 16:06.080]  spectacular political assassinations spectacular you no one should be bored
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.320]  right now I mean what you see lining up but see folks never recognize history
[16:10.320 --> 16:13.760]  while it's happening they people look back and go how do they put up with that
[16:13.760 --> 16:19.040]  nine times out of ten or really about 98% of the time really folks have to go
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.600]  through this and I grieve that we're going to have to go through this but at
[16:23.600 --> 16:27.520]  least we've got a jump on them historically that people might wake up in
[16:27.520 --> 16:33.240]  the middle of it because people hardly ever wake up before the collapse they
[16:33.240 --> 16:38.600]  usually wake up after or during but if we've got such a jump on the globalists
[16:38.600 --> 16:42.680]  in their program their methodology their mindset their program what makes them
[16:42.680 --> 16:46.400]  tick we know the enemy and we've emergency broadcast to the military
[16:46.400 --> 16:50.640]  police and everybody and it's not even that the military and police are goody
[16:50.640 --> 16:54.720]  two-shoes on average it's that they are on the inside they know this stuff's
[16:54.720 --> 16:58.760]  happening they know I'm accurate because they're seeing it from the inside and
[16:58.760 --> 17:02.000]  this program helps them break compartmentalization to see the larger
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.880]  picture then they can go verify even give us more intel and it's a it's a
[17:05.880 --> 17:12.520]  it's a maximizing lensing amplifying effect of understanding we have the
[17:12.520 --> 17:16.840]  enemy program broken down and then we can also then once we understand it from
[17:16.840 --> 17:21.520]  observing it we can then go research the enemy and there it's always public we
[17:21.520 --> 17:27.200]  observe extrapolate the program and then later find globalist documents that are
[17:27.200 --> 17:32.280]  word-for-word our analysis because historically they run the same programs
[17:32.280 --> 17:39.160]  only augmented with a new modern twist to it so we know the entire game plan we
[17:39.160 --> 17:43.240]  don't know exactly how they're gonna hit when they're gonna hit the exact play
[17:43.240 --> 17:48.520]  by play but we know what this team does we know who their coaches are we know
[17:48.520 --> 17:52.480]  what their strategies are we know what their game plans are we know where
[17:52.480 --> 17:56.760]  they're going what they're doing and if you as a new listener understood how
[17:56.760 --> 18:00.880]  evil they were you would not be afraid you would be scrambling in absolute
[18:00.880 --> 18:06.280]  survival combat mode right now ladies and gentlemen because we are under the
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.680]  wolf the food the water everything's being poisoned they are savaging the
[18:10.680 --> 18:14.080]  culture they are trying to ruin our children they are attacking the founders
[18:14.080 --> 18:19.600]  they are attacking Christianity they are attacking everything I mean we are

[24:19.880 --> 24:24.800]  there in his office saying Alex it's not just the Cato Institute testifying the
[24:24.800 --> 24:29.320]  Congress but the country's becoming a dictatorship of the executive branch
[24:29.320 --> 24:33.760]  controlled by offshore interest he's got all these clips of Congress people
[24:33.760 --> 24:38.200]  lawyers advisors I mean it's now being debated finally and we've been
[24:38.200 --> 24:42.680]  hammering the obvious we don't deserve credit here you like if you were in
[24:42.680 --> 24:46.160]  Colorado and you opened up that your tent that was a grizzly bear you know
[24:46.160 --> 24:49.640]  digging through your stuff you better lay down and act dead it's not like I'm a
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.400]  genius because I look out the tent there's a grizzly bear right there and
[24:53.400 --> 24:58.360]  that's a grizzly bear this is this is tyranny I mean it's two plus two equals
[24:58.360 --> 25:04.480]  four but I forgot under Common Corb they teach two plus two equals five and that
[25:04.480 --> 25:11.760]  daddies and mommies are bad again it's so over the top that that's where they
[25:11.760 --> 25:16.600]  get us is that they just do it with a straight face they move forward as they
[25:16.600 --> 25:19.760]  armed to the teeth against us they persecute gun owners it's happening all
[25:19.760 --> 25:22.760]  over the country legal gun owners are just being arrested everywhere taken to
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.160]  jail charged with fake charges juries are convicting them I've got stacks of
[25:28.160 --> 25:32.920]  news on that today I mean it is getting twilight zone folks because never
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.200]  before have so many people just been watching television even the people
[25:37.200 --> 25:40.880]  that are awake to what's going on partially are still like spectators
[25:40.880 --> 25:44.880]  they just let things happen to them they just don't stand up for their
[25:44.880 --> 25:48.920]  neighbors they don't take violations of their liberties personal they have a
[25:48.920 --> 25:59.000]  broken spirit and the system can't believe what it's gotten away with so of
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.480]  course they just took 80% of the pension funds from folks in Detroit and of course
[26:04.480 --> 26:07.680]  they're announcing that for other cities there's not going to be anything when the
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.400]  globalists are done ladies and gentlemen this has all been done in other
[26:10.400 --> 26:16.200]  countries over and over again they're following a program and the president has
[26:16.200 --> 26:21.600]  the IRS and the FBI persecuting gun grips libertarian grips Christian grips
[26:21.600 --> 26:26.600]  pro-life grips fast and furious Benghazi all the
[26:26.600 --> 26:34.880]  salindra scam deals the persecution of the media the illegal NSA spying the
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.440]  president saying NATO is over our military and Congress putting up with
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.840]  it the president legalizing all the illegals by fiat the president shutting
[26:43.840 --> 26:47.520]  down power plants not owned by General Electric doubling power prices in many
[26:47.520 --> 26:55.680]  areas of the country it's all total mafia total dictatorship but it doesn't
[26:55.680 --> 27:00.200]  mean he won't leave he's like shark teeth when they use those up they break
[27:00.200 --> 27:04.120]  away and other ones move forward Obama will leave office in a couple years I
[27:04.120 --> 27:07.160]  think they were thinking about trying to make him a dictator but the sales job
[27:07.160 --> 27:11.600]  didn't work so they'll bring in Chris Christie or somebody else and it'll be
[27:11.600 --> 27:17.480]  all a new gimmick and then the whole program just just rolls forward where
[27:17.480 --> 27:23.040]  the office has been turned into the nexus point of the Bilderberg group and the
[27:23.040 --> 27:30.520]  CFR to literally gut this country here is one of the head directors of the
[27:30.520 --> 27:36.080]  Cato Institute in Congress breaking down that we're in danger of the government
[27:36.080 --> 27:41.560]  being overthrown it's been overthrown that's why I say our revolution is on
[27:41.560 --> 27:45.840]  a revolution it is a restoration a reupload of the Republic Declaration
[27:45.840 --> 27:49.000]  of Independence as a government becomes destructive of the aims of liberty and
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  freedom it's our right and duty to reform the government to overthrow it
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.800]  well we want America back so we remove the foreign occupiers and reupload the
[27:57.800 --> 28:03.080]  Republic we reboot the system and we bring to justice the criminals let's go
[28:03.080 --> 28:06.400]  to a part of this clip here it is maybe mr. Lazarus knows better than I do how
[28:06.400 --> 28:09.720]  many bombs the the president has to drop without congressional authorization
[28:09.720 --> 28:15.640]  before that becomes war I don't know the actual number but I think what Mr. King
[28:15.640 --> 28:22.440]  was getting at is you know there is there is one last risk thing to which the
[28:22.440 --> 28:28.760]  people can resort if the government does not respect the the the restraints of
[28:28.760 --> 28:31.480]  the Constitution places on the government Abraham Lincoln talked about our
[28:31.480 --> 28:36.040]  right to alter our government or a revolutionary right to overthrow it and
[28:36.040 --> 28:41.160]  that is certainly something that no one wants to contemplate but as I mentioned
[28:41.160 --> 28:45.200]  in my in my in my written and my delivered testimony if the people come to
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.200]  believe that the government is no longer constrained by the laws and they will
[28:49.200 --> 28:53.240]  conclude that neither are they that is why this is a very very dangerous sort of
[28:53.240 --> 28:58.360]  thing for the president to do to wantonly ignore the laws to try to impose
[28:58.360 --> 29:01.240]  obligations on people that the legislature did not approve it's an
[29:01.240 --> 29:05.800]  excellent conclusion thank you that's right and it's the only conclusion and
[29:05.800 --> 29:11.400]  it's not a dangerous precedent we crossed that decades ago we are now under a
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.040]  dictatorship the government has a six percent approval rating according to
[29:15.040 --> 29:20.800]  Gallup I've never heard of a government that had 94% of people against it even
[29:20.800 --> 29:25.280]  hardcore dictatorships usually have 20 30% support by the idiots that work in
[29:25.280 --> 29:28.280]  the system I mean everyone in the government I know I keep saying the
[29:28.280 --> 29:31.600]  government's a problem but government people actually are more awake than the
[29:31.600 --> 29:37.440]  general public I don't even know what to say I mean I just won't live in a
[29:37.440 --> 29:41.560]  free country again I don't want to be totally bankrupted to make me a

[36:26.680 --> 36:31.200]  it's a double doctor day we're gonna have the acclaimed brain surgeon and just
[36:31.200 --> 36:39.200]  super expert dr. Russell Blalock will be joining us coming up today so you
[36:39.200 --> 36:44.000]  definitely do not want to miss any of that guys we give me dr. groups bio so
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.720]  I don't have that here thank you very much all right ladies and gentlemen
[36:47.720 --> 36:51.920]  that's the intro that Darren McBree and I put together that we just brought you
[36:51.920 --> 36:56.680]  and that's only a small smattering of the classical tyranny that we see in the
[36:56.680 --> 37:03.880]  news as the media follows the script for illegal checkpoints military pointing
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.840]  guns at people this is the preparation for when they really drop the hammer on
[37:08.840 --> 37:12.800]  everybody when they take your pension fund public and private and they're going
[37:12.800 --> 37:16.880]  to take about 30 to 40 percent generally is what they do in other
[37:16.880 --> 37:21.320]  countries of your private pension fund first and then a couple years later
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.000]  they'll take another 30 40 percent you'll end up with maybe 20 percent when
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.840]  they're done and then just like Detroit they just took 80 percent one fell
[37:29.840 --> 37:34.160]  swoop in fact they think we're so broke back I mean using the NFL to push
[37:34.160 --> 37:40.440]  Obamacare and gun bands now and political correctness as well they might
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.800]  just take everything I mean I don't know I mean other countries that fight back
[37:44.800 --> 37:49.800]  a little bit so maybe I shouldn't follow what they've done in other nations but
[37:49.800 --> 37:55.400]  vaporized as the headline on info wars calm Detroit obliterates retirement
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.720]  funds 80% cuts to pensioners this is going to affect everyone yeah all the
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.960]  government folks that have moved to Texas out of the other states that have
[38:04.960 --> 38:08.760]  collapsed under the New World Order I can't tell you how many retired police
[38:08.760 --> 38:13.140]  and firefighters and city managers and you name it live out where I live out
[38:13.140 --> 38:16.480]  in the Hill Country and they're all awake they're all freaked out and they
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.560]  all also know you're not gonna have your money soon just okay and and it's
[38:22.560 --> 38:27.560]  because again it's not because it's even unfeasible to actually pay the
[38:27.560 --> 38:31.520]  pensions and some of them are exorbitant a lot of them aren't it's that they
[38:31.520 --> 38:39.680]  created a quadrillion and a half dollars of fake derivatives as a black hole
[38:39.680 --> 38:43.640]  they're not even propping them up they've already been triaged to suck off all
[38:43.640 --> 38:49.600]  the wealth then they tell the cops and bureaucrats and IRS go shake people down
[38:49.600 --> 38:54.200]  get more money or you're not gonna get your pension you're never gonna get any
[38:54.200 --> 38:57.960]  of it unless we defeat the New World Order have you figured that out yet and
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.120]  I think most of you have figured that out yet but you're going to be betrayed
[39:02.120 --> 39:06.040]  just like you allowed the people to be betrayed and I want to be clear I don't
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.200]  even blame the government people I blame all of us look in the mirror just
[39:10.200 --> 39:15.720]  like V for vendetta we wanted to be lazy we wanted to think America was
[39:15.720 --> 39:18.840]  different wouldn't go the same way every other country went when people gave
[39:18.840 --> 39:23.240]  into corruption we're not just going to go the same direction we're going to
[39:23.240 --> 39:28.960]  fall harder than anybody's ever fallen because it's a true saying folks the
[39:28.960 --> 39:35.920]  bigger they are the harder they fall it's almost easier in a fight to get a
[39:35.920 --> 39:39.480]  big guy down on the ground I don't know what it is they just think they've got
[39:39.480 --> 39:43.440]  it over on you and they're gonna win and that's the end of it and it's the same
[39:43.440 --> 39:47.560]  thing with this whole republic ladies and gentlemen we're already on the
[39:47.560 --> 39:51.320]  ground and the New World Order's what brought us down and we're on life
[39:51.320 --> 39:54.840]  support right now they're busy pulling the wires out because they're vulture
[39:54.840 --> 40:00.440]  capitalist anti-free market they're going to eat down to our bones and then
[40:00.440 --> 40:03.320]  the hyenas are going to come in after that's what they even call them and
[40:03.320 --> 40:07.440]  they're even going to eat our bones and slurp the marrow out of them
[40:07.440 --> 40:12.360]  politically financially culturally they are going to sit back in Luxembourg
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.560]  and Switzerland and London and they are going to watch everything else collapse
[40:18.560 --> 40:23.280]  into hell all the major billionaires I mean all of them are leaving Israel
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.960]  shelling out physically running to Switzerland physically running to London
[40:28.960 --> 40:35.360]  physically running to the Cook Islands physically running a lot of them are
[40:35.360 --> 40:40.480]  moving to Eastern Europe and literally Romania and Transylvania what was
[40:40.480 --> 40:46.400]  previously Transylvania that border region they are they are real what why
[40:46.400 --> 40:50.680]  do you think they're doing that why do you think elites all over the world what
[40:50.680 --> 40:54.040]  do you think is going to happen to Israel what do you think is going to
[40:54.040 --> 40:56.880]  happen to the United States what do you think is going to happen I'll tell you
[40:56.880 --> 41:05.400]  what's going to happen folks war famine pestilence World War three that's where
[41:05.400 --> 41:09.120]  the devil wants to take us and I know you atheists laugh at all oh you're going
[41:09.120 --> 41:17.960]  to be laughing let me tell you see how that atheism works out for you you
[41:17.960 --> 41:22.440]  people are the most afraid of death the most and I'm talking about the socialist
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.360]  authoritarian atheist actually a lot of atheists are actually awake to the new
[41:25.360 --> 41:28.720]  world order so I don't want to over generalize that I'm not declaring war
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.200]  on anybody I'm just telling you right now that I've told you this in the build
[41:34.200 --> 41:37.640]  up my gut has never been more concerned my intellect has never been more
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.360]  concerned everybody's freaking out I mean it's not hard like looking at your
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.200]  window in a tornadoes coming in you know to get to shelter and I grew up in
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.600]  Dallas folks I've only seen tornadoes once in Austin and then I got blown off
[41:50.600 --> 41:55.080]  the road outside Austin by a tornado but growing up in Dallas I start tornadoes
[41:55.080 --> 41:58.360]  every year I don't know why I'm going off into that because we lived upon a hill
[41:58.360 --> 42:03.800]  in Rockwall Texas overlooking Lake Ray Hubbard in Dallas and I could see all
[42:03.800 --> 42:08.240]  these cities off in the distance from that hilltop and I and in my dad would
[42:08.240 --> 42:11.400]  say see that tornado and we go look at the news show up straight up and I watch
[42:11.400 --> 42:17.040]  tornadoes come down out of the rural area what's all built up now and I'd
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.520]  watch him be gray or black and hit the water and turn blue turn into water
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.560]  spouts one time I watched three tornadoes that were beautiful it came in and
[42:25.560 --> 42:28.080]  went out across the lake just probably three miles away from where I was
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.280]  looking off that hilltop and I watched those tornadoes and I'm just watching
[42:32.280 --> 42:35.200]  these tornadoes just just come in tearing everything up and these these
[42:35.200 --> 42:39.480]  tornadoes aren't beautiful folks they are full of innocent blood they are
[42:39.480 --> 42:46.920]  drunk on all the horrible things they've done and I just and they go oh your
[42:46.920 --> 42:52.200]  conspiracy theorist there's no tornado and I'm watching it tear up people's
[42:52.200 --> 42:57.080]  houses a mile away now and it's coming towards me and I'm still here in this
[42:57.080 --> 43:01.520]  still in this country the epicenter of this trying to warn people and I'm not
[43:01.520 --> 43:06.360]  even mad at my detractors I'm even mad at Rachel Maddow and and CNN host
[43:06.360 --> 43:11.440]  called saying lies about me I look at these people standing on collapsing old
[43:11.440 --> 43:18.360]  media shelling out minute by minute for narcissism and 30 pieces of silver and I
[43:18.360 --> 43:22.640]  know down the road folks they're going to literally literally in many cases go
[43:22.640 --> 43:26.560]  into their bedroom and take pills and kill themselves they are literally gonna
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.720]  go just like Judas just like Judas to the cemetery and put a rope around their
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.560]  neck they're gonna jump out of windows when they lose everything I lost
[43:36.560 --> 43:41.880]  everything I'm I wouldn't even care I don't worship that it's only a little
[43:41.880 --> 43:45.440]  bit of security it's also a burden to mess with it but I need some capital to
[43:45.440 --> 43:49.880]  defend myself and be strong but I don't worship it it's literally I don't
[43:49.880 --> 43:55.280]  worship gas I put in my truck it's fuel but to these people that worship the
[43:55.280 --> 44:00.080]  bobbles it's their golden calf ladies and gentlemen they are going to jump out
[44:00.080 --> 44:06.840]  of windows by the tens of thousands they jumped out by the thousands in 1929 and
[44:06.840 --> 44:12.720]  over the next three years of deepening depression when the denial was going that
[44:12.720 --> 44:16.040]  oh things are gonna be okay because they'd lose their house they'd lose their
[44:16.040 --> 44:21.280]  status they these people all think everything in their world is about their
[44:21.280 --> 44:25.720]  status owning a bunch of stuff and dressing fancy and walking into the
[44:25.720 --> 44:28.640]  country club and they're not well they're not happy to go to the country club to
[44:28.640 --> 44:32.520]  go play golf or go eat a good steak they're excited strutting in front of
[44:32.520 --> 44:35.440]  people that they're in the biggest house in the neighborhood and they've got the
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.280]  biggest stake in the neighborhood and they've got the best trophy wife in the
[44:38.280 --> 44:42.200]  neighborhood to impress people they don't like and don't want to be around
[44:42.200 --> 44:48.960]  I'm not a peacock ladies and gentlemen displaying my feathers and where are the
[44:48.960 --> 44:53.800]  other men out there that want to have a civilization and want to have your grave
[44:53.800 --> 44:58.200]  visited by your great-grandchildren and have them say he was an honorable man
[44:58.200 --> 45:05.040]  she was an honorable woman you people don't have family names you don't care
[45:05.040 --> 45:08.760]  about your children you don't care about the planet you don't care about the
[45:08.760 --> 45:18.160]  future you really want to give in to evil I got a bunch of news but the boycott
[45:18.160 --> 45:24.880]  of the NFL is so essential that I'm begging everyone to boycott the NFL
[45:24.880 --> 45:29.680]  because it's being used to push an anti-American agenda and if they can get
[45:29.680 --> 45:33.480]  away with this the Obamacare all but they can get away with anything so here is
[45:33.480 --> 45:38.400]  my special report from info wars nightly news last night breaking this down
[45:38.400 --> 45:42.840]  because we've got to fight back in the culture war or we're dead meat here it
[45:42.840 --> 45:49.280]  is I have a question for you is there anything that American football fans
[45:49.280 --> 45:56.280]  will not put up with from the NFL throughout history corrupt governments
[45:56.280 --> 46:01.560]  and tyrannical regimes have used sporting events as propaganda showcases
[46:01.560 --> 46:07.560]  ancient Rome use sporting events as a place to promote their agenda Hitler
[46:07.560 --> 46:14.160]  famously in the 1936 Olympics hosted by Germany use the event to push Nazism and
[46:14.160 --> 46:20.040]  other forms of oppression and now the National Football League resembles
[46:20.040 --> 46:26.600]  something out of the Soviet era in Russia promoting anti-family anti-gun
[46:26.600 --> 46:34.240]  and the big question is will Americans now put up with the National Football
[46:34.240 --> 46:41.520]  League pushing the nightmare that is Obamacare officially in their broadcast
[46:41.520 --> 46:48.200]  and President Obama in the intro now to Monday Night Football with Hank Williams
[46:48.200 --> 46:55.440]  Jr. removed and of course the biggest outrage officially demonizing last year
[46:55.440 --> 47:00.600]  and this year the right of citizens to keep and bear arms for self-defense
[47:00.600 --> 47:08.320]  it's not just Bob Costas it's the NFL itself is acting like Joseph Stalin has
[47:08.320 --> 47:14.720]  seized control of it and football fans are putting up with it and so we are now
[47:14.720 --> 47:20.760]  seeing more and more of this anti-liberty anti-American garbage so
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.440]  Americans have to decide are you gonna roll over and put up with this because
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.800]  you love watching your football so much or are you going to boycott the NFL
[47:30.800 --> 47:36.200]  because of their anti-American agenda and because the NFL thinks that the
[47:36.200 --> 47:41.360]  American spirit is broken because they think football fans will put up with
[47:41.360 --> 47:46.760]  anything they've now doubled down and they've banned any type of pro-second
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.880]  amendment advertising from the NFL and from the Super Bowl part of every day
[47:51.880 --> 47:57.440]  some kind of anti-violence anti-gun message every day every school at every
[47:57.440 --> 48:01.200]  level one thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as
[48:01.200 --> 48:04.760]  well is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to
[48:04.760 --> 48:09.160]  simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to
[48:09.160 --> 48:13.320]  do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[48:13.320 --> 48:18.640]  about guns in a vastly different way a very well-respected firearms manufacturer
[48:18.640 --> 48:25.200]  Daniel defense produced an ad that simply shows a father driving home talking
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.720]  about how he wants to protect his family and how it's a basic human right he
[48:29.720 --> 48:34.120]  comes in the house walks by photos of his family himself and his Marine Corps
[48:34.120 --> 48:40.560]  uniform goes in to be with his wife and his baby daughter and no one has the
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.000]  right to tell me how to defend them and then they simply say brought to you by
[48:46.000 --> 48:53.200]  Daniel defense and never even advertise the firearms the reason the NFL banned
[48:53.200 --> 48:59.080]  the wholesome ad is because it is so wholesome and it shows how natural and
[48:59.080 --> 49:05.560]  good self-defense is with firearms in the hands of the American people to
[49:05.560 --> 49:10.200]  protect our homes and that's why it's been banned that's why it's been
[49:10.200 --> 49:14.360]  restricted this is a pattern of censorship where they got rid of Hank
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.720]  Williams Jr. because he didn't worship the president and put the president in
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.480]  the intro in his place you mean when John Boehner played golf with President
[49:23.480 --> 49:30.440]  Obama oh yeah that'd be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu okay okay
[49:30.440 --> 49:36.720]  not hardly we have a war on the press now in this country even Democrats admit
[49:36.720 --> 49:41.600]  it's unprecedented we as Americans have to come together in defense of the
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.320]  entire Bill of Rights not just the Second Amendment but the First Amendment as
[49:46.320 --> 49:52.200]  well and have to send a clear message to the NFL that we're not gonna put up
[49:52.200 --> 49:56.000]  with TSA groping us to get into the game that we're not gonna sit there and be
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.640]  bombarded by Obama administration messages at these gladiatorial events
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.920]  and we're not going to see good wholesome pro-family advertising band
[50:06.920 --> 50:13.720]  while they allow all this raunchy pop music garbage to be spewed at our
[50:13.720 --> 50:19.240]  families the NFL is completely out of control it is being used as a propaganda
[50:19.240 --> 50:23.640]  system against the American people and if we don't have a serious boycott
[50:23.640 --> 50:30.000]  against the NFL and against their major sponsors we will basically put up with
[50:30.000 --> 50:36.040]  anything and the sky is the limit there is an attack on free speech across the
[50:36.040 --> 50:43.520]  board and we have to respond to it Yahoo Google newspapers TV stations you name
[50:43.520 --> 50:48.880]  it have banned gun shops advertising have banned shooting ranges from
[50:48.880 --> 50:53.720]  advertising there is a reign of terror where major banks are telling gun
[50:53.720 --> 50:58.280]  manufacturers and gun shops we won't take your money you can't have a bank
[50:58.280 --> 51:05.400]  account with us this is a hardcore form of economic warfare and now the NFL has
[51:05.400 --> 51:08.800]  been turned into the tip of the spear to destroy our Bill of Rights and
[51:08.800 --> 51:14.040]  Constitution if the American people will not wake up and of the sleeping giant
[51:14.040 --> 51:18.160]  will not send a clear message to the NFL that we are not going to be
[51:18.160 --> 51:24.880]  propagandized by it then America's over America's done if they can take the so
[51:24.880 --> 51:30.000]  called American pastime and turn it into an authoritarian bullhorn we're done
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.760]  ladies and gentlemen football is not the American pastime 1776 and July 4th is
[51:36.760 --> 51:42.120]  about human liberty and the individual being empowered it's not about giant
[51:42.120 --> 51:47.280]  decadent gladiatorial events that are about fame and fortune and shallow
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.640]  garbage if Americans knew as much about our Bill of Rights and Constitution and
[51:52.640 --> 51:56.600]  about the free market and about what made this country great if Americans knew
[51:56.600 --> 52:03.040]  as much about that as they did about how much some lineman can bench press we
[52:03.040 --> 52:08.560]  would still be a free country so will you trade liberty and the blessings of
[52:08.560 --> 52:15.720]  liberty for the NFL and for Obama the choice is up to you contact the NFL
[52:15.720 --> 52:22.000]  contact their sponsors make your own YouTube videos and tell the NFL if you
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.960]  agree with me that you are not going to put up with their propaganda and if you
[52:26.960 --> 52:31.760]  think it's good that the NFL has been turned into a Soviet style propaganda
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.680]  bureau then by all means put out your own videos in support of it if you really
[52:36.680 --> 52:41.920]  want to live in North Korea then tell us why tyranny is such a great thing let
[52:41.920 --> 52:46.800]  your voice be heard tell the NFL in phone calls and emails and on Facebook
[52:46.800 --> 52:51.000]  and Twitter that you're not going to stand by and be part of this that you're
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.080]  not going to watch any of these games you're not gonna watch Fox that's going
[52:55.080 --> 52:58.440]  to air the Super Bowl and that you're gonna tell others to boycott it and
[52:58.440 --> 53:03.880]  spend time with their family or time at local churches and soup kitchens being
[53:03.880 --> 53:09.520]  with real Americans and not part of this modern Roman decadent spectacle that
[53:09.520 --> 53:16.120]  has become the National Football League give me liberty or give me death as for
[53:16.120 --> 53:21.440]  me and my family we are going to 100% boycott the NFL for the next couple years
[53:21.440 --> 53:26.920]  until they change their tune and apologize and promise to stop brainwashing
[53:26.920 --> 53:31.680]  the American people all right folks there's the report we skipped that
[53:31.680 --> 53:35.400]  network break because that message is so important and again this is what
[53:35.400 --> 53:39.880]  tyranny does it just pushes and pushes and pushes to where you're awake to it
[53:39.880 --> 53:45.960]  but you still don't fight back against it and then they've won it is so
[53:45.960 --> 53:53.360]  incredibly essential right now more than ever that when your friends want you to
[53:53.360 --> 54:00.160]  go out to a local restaurant and want you to you know watch the NFL game with
[54:00.160 --> 54:05.800]  them say no let's go do something else I'm boycotting the NFL I would go to
[54:05.800 --> 54:09.600]  these sports bars and places and tell them hey you want to be in the news when
[54:09.600 --> 54:14.480]  you get into your sports bar actually you know hand out tri-corner hats and
[54:14.480 --> 54:21.880]  have a second amendment party and say that you're going to watch war movies
[54:21.880 --> 54:27.200]  or something instead of watching the NFL it'll be all over the news I want
[54:27.200 --> 54:30.040]  listeners when there's so many different ideas there's millions of them I want
[54:30.040 --> 54:33.720]  listeners to shoot your own YouTube videos about the NFL I'd like to see you
[54:33.720 --> 54:38.520]  go hand out flyers in front of the stadiums and and point out that it's
[54:38.520 --> 54:45.880]  now a political system of manipulation it's un-American you've got to stand
[54:45.880 --> 54:52.200]  against this folks they have Obama saying yes we can in the intro to money
[54:52.200 --> 54:57.040]  night football and and Pavlovian Lee then cutting to the teams running out
[54:57.040 --> 55:02.080]  after you see the president rooting for the football I mean that's never
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.280]  happened that's literally like Hitler in the intro to the Olympics in 1936 I mean
[55:07.280 --> 55:15.520]  this is just so out of control and it's all part of the propaganda and and this
[55:15.520 --> 55:22.920]  is an example that we can use with the sheeple to show them how they're being
[55:22.920 --> 55:29.120]  propagandized and we won't save the world by boycotting NFL but resisting we
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.280]  will this is only one more act of resistance so this video was posted on
[55:34.280 --> 55:38.800]  Facebook if I come and pull Watson and the crew send it back out of on Facebook
[55:38.800 --> 55:43.840]  just the video itself to send it out tweet it on my Twitter at real Alex
[55:43.840 --> 55:46.840]  Jones I was gonna tweet this morning but got busy so I need the crew to tweet it
[55:46.840 --> 55:54.200]  it's posted on info wars calm right now NFL faces national protest NFL faces
[55:54.200 --> 55:59.640]  national protest and the video that you just heard radio listeners is there on
[55:59.640 --> 56:07.200]  the site it is essential that we fight for the info war and that we fight for
[56:07.200 --> 56:10.920]  the Second Amendment and that you get this video and send it out to everybody
[56:10.920 --> 56:13.800]  you know why the Attorney General meeting with TV executives somebody to
[56:13.800 --> 56:17.880]  brainwash people against guns and violence that's why they don't let kids
[56:17.880 --> 56:22.280]  at school they suspend the kid more who fights back against the bully and they
[56:22.280 --> 56:28.520]  do the bully under Common Core look it up and you're like why well it's like
[56:28.520 --> 56:33.600]  England now they will put you in jail for decades if you catch someone
[56:33.600 --> 56:36.760]  raping your wife or attacking you in your house there's cases of it and you
[56:36.760 --> 56:42.320]  grab a butcher knife and stab them even if they're stabbing you they will then
[56:42.320 --> 56:48.120]  let that person go or give them a month in jail and you get 15 years in jail
[56:48.120 --> 56:52.760]  because the ultimate sin is fighting back against criminals because they're a
[56:52.760 --> 56:56.600]  criminal government that literally just grabs foreigners that visit and cut
[56:56.600 --> 57:01.160]  babies out of their wounds I mean there's nothing they won't do because no one
[57:01.160 --> 57:05.840]  will stand up to them so the sky's the limit the worst then gravitate and take
[57:05.840 --> 57:09.840]  control and that's why tyranny always only gets worse if you give into it
[57:09.840 --> 57:15.240]  because it's like a gravity well it's like jumping off a cliff you will fall
[57:15.240 --> 57:22.840]  you will fall to the bottom you will speed up it's so amazing that we've
[57:22.840 --> 57:26.480]  gotten to this point as a society and that's why it's more important than
[57:26.480 --> 57:30.160]  ever that you reach out to people this Christmas and this holiday season with
[57:30.160 --> 57:34.560]  the message of liberty don't make it about a bunch of millionaires playing
[57:34.560 --> 57:39.560]  grab you know what and a bunch of billionaire mobsters I've looked into
[57:39.560 --> 57:44.760]  the NFL you see all the fake calls now it's even getting unpopular from
[57:44.760 --> 57:48.320]  its peak a few years ago because people know the fix is in I mean it's all
[57:48.320 --> 57:55.560]  gangsterism the playoffs are fixed folks it's all a big fraud and the
[57:55.560 --> 58:00.200]  gangsters I've seen meetings of the National Football League owners and I
[58:00.200 --> 58:05.800]  mean they are a bunch of dirtbacks they are a bunch of gangsters folks they've
[58:05.800 --> 58:09.480]  all got bodyguards and guns and they want you disarmed so they can have their
[58:09.480 --> 58:15.480]  way with you and your family they are your enemies owners need to come out and
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.280]  not be afraid of the dead dinosaur media you know 20 years ago the media could
[58:19.280 --> 58:24.120]  bring down an owner who was a patriot then now the corporate whore media if
[58:24.120 --> 58:31.200]  they attack you it's like a red badge of courage a blue ribbon of I mean we
[58:31.200 --> 58:36.600]  listen we need if there are owners out there who aren't total criminals we need
[58:36.600 --> 58:42.920]  sports stars to go public speak out thank you or let them rob your basic
[58:42.920 --> 58:46.160]  liberties that our forebears fought for I mean we're being robbed we're being
[58:46.160 --> 58:52.920]  robbed take it personal coming up second hour in the last 50 years iodine has been
[58:52.920 --> 58:57.280]  phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a
[58:57.280 --> 59:02.240]  practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the
[59:02.240 --> 59:07.280]  halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the
[59:07.280 --> 59:11.560]  federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[59:11.560 --> 59:16.880]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[59:16.880 --> 59:22.200]  record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously
[59:22.200 --> 59:28.000]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a

[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.320]  Dr. Edward Groob one of the smartest people I know is gonna be joining us
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.040]  coming up to cover a host of issues the next segment then we've got another
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.440]  doctor coming on brain surgeon medical doctor it pretty much comes in the same
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.840]  analysis as Dr. Groob and Dr. Russell Blalock hard to get guess we appreciate
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.920]  him coming on talk about Obamacare and how his predictions of what it would do
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:00.920]  I thought we're a little over the top to show how naive I am and exactly what
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.280]  Blalock said is now happening you can go back to the interviews four years ago
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:13.680]  two years ago a year ago six months ago I mean it is precisely precisely by the
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.560]  way Dr. Blalock goes and we went and covered him in Las Vegas it was like
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.560]  2,000 medical doctors and scientists there paying huge amounts of money just
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.920]  to hear him speak for two hours he and he did he developed all the stuff that's
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.840]  common literature now like in cytotoxins and all these terms that he
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:36.640]  literally 25 30 years ago researched it and coined are now like mainline he
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.680]  invented a bunch of the top brain surgeries used today I'm not trying to
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.480]  go into a worship festive Blalock it's just that he is amazing he's gonna be
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.560]  joining us coming up in the third hour because I don't have the staff it if I
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.440]  had the money I would have people that just chronicled in a word search I
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.760]  guess we're kind of doing that now everything we talk about what our guests
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.720]  say and predict show that we could then just go right back to it and pull it you
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.400]  know with like a word search at this point in the video or in the audio they
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.400]  said this and we could go back and find it by the way I mentioned this earlier
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.800]  but we were able to find it Bush in January of 2009 when when Obama was
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:23.080]  president-elect he was saying you know I like Obama we've been playing golf and
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.920]  hanging out and you know what's great about it Obama as things collapse and
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.240]  get really bad he's not gonna go what was me and cry about it he's just gonna
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.080]  you know deal with it and it was all an inside oh my gosh they're gonna drop the
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.640]  hammer on everybody this is the controlled implosion I mean they're
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.200]  right out there telling you what they're going to do to you and if you play
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.600]  bowl with them you can be like Bill Clinton and keep half the money that he
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:59.040]  collected for the charity in Haiti and he uses it for his $40,000 one-way trip
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:05.960]  luxury $50 million jet he flies on so you give money for little black kids in
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.760]  Haiti it literally goes into the pocket of the pig Clinton when he flies to
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.400]  Japan to get paid a half million dollars to get a delayed payoff that's how they
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.400]  do his speeches or he flies you know to London to be paid a million dollars or
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.040]  flies a university to be paid a hundred thousand dollars is his lowest thing for
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:30.800]  universities he flies on a private jet with his hookers and all his drugs and
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:37.920]  the rest of it paid for by poor people that send in money to help Haitian
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:46.600]  kids I'm sorry it's just so sick and then you've got Foxconn the worst factories
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.280]  in China many studies have shown where they have a urinal under the women and
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.280]  the men and you have to defecate and urinate at your chair and then they've
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.560]  got suicide nets and they drug you and they do forced pregnancy test and do a
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.400]  forced abortions right there in the factory and then you stay in these war
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.800]  in 200 square foot well actually in some areas you actually get in a coffin and
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.520]  they slide you into the wall I'm not joking so actually 200 square foot for
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.560]  us here now that's they're gonna raise the taxes we have to live in 200 square
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.760]  foot that's Bloomberg San Francisco New York are doing it actually there it's
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.640]  coffin size I'm sorry it's smaller and they put you in these coffins in the wall
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.000]  and then you defecate and urinate standing there at the thing and you're
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.840]  and they put you on drugs and of course they're getting ready to replace them
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.440]  with robots but because Al Gore is on the board of Apple it's like oh that's
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.680]  nice if you're against you know the Chinese being used as slaves you're
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.400]  racist against them and again they didn't industrialize China to empower the
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.880]  Chinese people they did it to enslave them and use them up while the Communist
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.720]  Party pigs set up their perched on everyone if you want a good economy
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.840]  you're like Henry Ford who paid people about 10 times what the regular factory
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:59.320]  wages were he said I want people to have money to buy my cars

[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.040]  our liberties and a government that has the IRS persecuting gun groups veterans
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.920]  groups Christian groups pro-life groups alternative medicine groups I mean you
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.520]  name it the tyranny's there the examples of corruption or legion but even in
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.360]  Congress we got a special report coming up on the nightly news tonight because
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.120]  there's a bunch of examples of this are having hearings now about the executive
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.960]  branch being a dictatorship oh I'll just make the illegals legal I'm the
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.080]  president I'm God I'll just put us under NATO we can't do that it's
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.440]  unconstitutional I do whatever I want I'll just shut down all the power plants
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.760]  that General Electric doesn't own and double and triple their profits I'll
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.680]  just put carbon taxes in a regulation about microwaves that isn't even law and
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.000]  then put carbon tax on everybody's carbon expenditure Obama did that this
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.960]  year and it's just now added to your bill he didn't even sign an executive
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.560]  order I mean they could start interpreting his flatulence if they
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:52.480]  wanted to and and you know have some tea reader tea leave reader that's how the
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.680]  ancients did it they would take like bones and put in a fire and how the bones
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.400]  broke they would go off that or they would go to the Oracle of Delphi some
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.720]  woman breathing you know nauseous gases hallucinating stuff really they had the
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.880]  people behind them telling her what to say it's political manipulation but my
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.680]  point is is that they could you know run the country according to Obama going
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.240]  out and looking at a butchered bull every morning and reading its intestines
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.120]  that's what the Romans would do I mean it's it's it literally God emperor type
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.320]  stuff is begun and Congress I played a clip earlier is having hearings going
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:29.320]  well actually the president's been set for the executive to be a dictator and
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:35.760]  and now suddenly everything's executive exactly we're now going into a
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.640]  dictatorship and let me show you a headline up at drudgereport.com right
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:45.960]  now no one says it like drudge does dirty Harry that's Harry Reid exempt
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.560]  staff from Obamacare and by the way now admits there are death panels because
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.000]  that's because it's now law suckers and that is from CNN that's right one of the
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.120]  main architects in the Senate of it admits that his people are exempt and
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:10.640]  again that's the real essence at the bottom of tyranny is that four legs
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.160]  bad two legs good to use the George Arwell animal farm analogy because it
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.440]  started out with the pigs for the horses and other animals let's revolt
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.560]  against the humans four legs good two legs bad by the time the pigs were done
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.400]  and run the humans off with the horses help they were inside the house
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.600]  dressing like humans saying two legs good four legs bad and that's what they're
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:37.920]  doing it's totally illegal my dad came into work today to visit me and was
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:44.520]  showing me his insurance it it went up 30 something percent two months ago so
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.840]  he's lucky a lot of people's double triple quadrupled or 500 and something
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.000]  percent in Texas with Humana for families with no pre-existing conditions
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.320]  he got another letter it's up 30 look percent again and there's so that's how
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.280]  they're doing it every few months it goes up 30 something percent my dad's
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:05.320]  never used his insurance whatever reason I learned this from him I don't know why
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.800]  he does it but I guess he's you think he keeps your insurance down when he goes
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.400]  to the doctor once while for check if he just pays cash you pay for the but
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.040]  doesn't matter that still gets filed with him to the surveillance system and
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.160]  that's what Obama cares about as well tracking everything you do feeding it
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:24.800]  back this is the mega total ripoff and it's designed to try to stop alternative
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.960]  medicine from getting any kind of Medicare Medicaid or insurance money
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:32.800]  it's designed to lower the quality of care and it's designed to let insurance
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.080]  companies in some cases charge 11 times what they did previous and not cover
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:42.320]  pre-existing conditions and all these morons that they're in the news going
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:46.640]  well 10% of America was able to sign up they're now going in going I signed up
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.000]  I'm in the system they go well we can't even get on a system you're not signed
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.600]  up where's your insurance car they go it's free Obama I got an Obama phone now
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.160]  I get Obama care and they look at them and they go there is no free health care
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.600]  there was previous under charity care under law we've pretty much gotten rid
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.240]  of that now some doctors are still trying to do it but they're being told
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.640]  by the big management companies you can just like it came out in the news
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.960]  yesterday I saw it on Drudge 2 that small banks and credit unions are being
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.520]  shut down under the banking regs that were supposed to fix the mega banks the
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.040]  mega banks wrote that to shut down their competition they've got unlimited bail
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.880]  out money now and then the local bank can't do fractional reserve banking so
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.640]  they're shutting down that they don't want you to get money they want to fix
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:38.080]  system come print day all you're gonna get is a screw job they got you addicted
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.040]  to government and the NFL distractions and all the and the opiate of the masses
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.320]  the gladiatorial diversions and now they fatten this up and now it's butchering
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:54.600]  time and many of you will settle for 10% of the chicken feed you've been getting
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:59.080]  by the time they're done instead of being free and wealthy and prosperous you
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:05.040]  want slavery you love slavery and the system thinks that you're ready now
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.920]  you'll eat GMO you'll drink all the poison you'll do whatever you want why
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.120]  not why not just take your pension funds why not spy on everybody without
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.400]  warrants why not set up checkpoints why not cut babies out of women's wombs for
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.720]  CPS now why not have the FBI persecute the Tea Party under order from the
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.440]  White House and it comes out and no one gets in trouble that's how Hitler
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.160]  started was just persecuting his political opposition with regulations and
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:34.640]  and and audits and things and so I wanted to get Dr. Ed group in here with us
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.960]  because man I tell you none of us are perfect I have a vision of what I want
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.440]  in my life but I obviously can't get there overnight I thought they'd kill me
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.160]  anytime for a decade so I just ate like a pig was totally unhealthy and because
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.320]  I've been physically attacked and death-threaded a lot and I just thought
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.360]  well you know why even worry about what I look like or feel like now I realize
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.360]  it's long haul Tommy Pallotta movie producer friend of mine he said Alex
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.840]  that's how they really kill you is making you think they're gonna kill you and
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.400]  then you just don't care about yourself you're killing yourself so it's
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:12.040]  taking me about five six years to lose 40 something pounds to get healthier and
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.000]  I weighed 275 pounds at the height of it folks I'm still a little overweight but
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.360]  actually standing there out of the shower I got a little bit of fat on my
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:22.520]  stomach I just got a long torso actually look pretty good now I don't look that
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.520]  good on TV it puts weight on you but the point is is that my brain works so much
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.960]  better and I've gotten into supplementation and tried to research it
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.680]  last three four years in this process of detoxing trying to get my life
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:41.680]  straight and I finally found Dr. Group and the things he was doing and I
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.720]  learned stuff from him that I didn't hear from anybody else that has just been
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.840]  absolutely miraculous like he helped us develop this only form it's the only
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.520]  form is totally proprietary of nascent iodine that that that is totally bio
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.760]  available and absorbed by the body not bound and other iodine is great as well
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.400]  I mean it's just this is this is the best stuff from my research and of course
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.960]  that helps us find our operation as well in forward's life.com but I wanted to
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:12.760]  get him in here to talk about this big stack of news where Harvard now admits
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:18.000]  fluoride decreases IQ areas in Germany the Netherlands all over are moving
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.320]  fluoride so good news and then we're going to get it some other systems of
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.320]  detox with him as well because the real revolution here is that they're
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:32.120]  targeting our bodies so that we're so poisoned that we can't even get upset or
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.280]  motivated to resist them so the revolution starts with our bodies it
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.960]  starts with getting our kids out of the public schools it starts with decoupling
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.200]  from the system not caring what Hollywood and the media say and that's
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.320]  happening Congress has a six percent approval rating the mainstream media is
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.360]  dying but we've got to go all the way and not just leave Babylon not just come
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:57.360]  out of Egypt but actually build a new promised land and there is no silver
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.320]  bullet but there's a process and Dr. Ed group joins us here today in studio
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:08.000]  advisor to info wars health.com info wars life.com and of course info wars.com
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.920]  and he's here with us today you've heard my rant about Obamacare and how the
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.520]  government and the corporations are exempt I mean is that not the ultimate
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.720]  form of discrimination of course they're screaming racism all day if you love
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.800]  liberty as a distraction because they're actually cheating all of us that
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:29.040]  aren't on the inside group that's been going on for a long time when they started
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.800]  putting fluoride in the water and everything else and poisoning the air
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.720]  and poisoning the food but today you know if you look at the combination of
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.200]  chemicals that we're exposed to every day I mean fluoride is so toxic I mean
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.000]  the hydrofluorosilic acid that they put in the water supply and if you have a
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.280]  hard time saying that you just automatically know it's a poison I
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.640]  mean it's almost as poisonous as arsenic so what I try to do is tell people it's
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.320]  everywhere I mean if you go to Starbucks and get some coffee you're drinking
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:00.680]  fluoride if you drink beer you're drinking fluoride wine all the food that you
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.200]  make this the bread that you eat all that has to be made with water right I
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.320]  mean the water that you're spraying on your yard your organic garden plus they
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.840]  added they added to the floor to the bread prescription medications have
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:18.120]  fluoride it I mean you're right it's designed to dumb you down to make you
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:24.160]  non-motivated and non-aggressive so really what I want to talk about is how
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.120]  people can address that and how people can reduce that because there's a
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.480]  million chemicals we could pick out there but really if you take like the
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.760]  top five I mean they know and it's been in the water system and it's been
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:39.800]  everywhere for so long how detrimental fluoride is it wasn't until it like for
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.240]  example if you stick your hand in hydrofluorosilic acid you will die just
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:47.160]  because you came in contact with it that's how poisonous it is you can't
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:53.240]  breathe the gases so it was funny that Anthony Gutiarty mentioned in late 2012
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.800]  you know well what is out there I mean what can you develop a product that
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.920]  will get rid of fluoride inside the system I was like you know what that's a
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.240]  great idea that's right it's Gutiarty that came up with it yeah so I said you
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.400]  know I've got about a two-year waiting list for product development but I was
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.560]  like wait a second if you can address the main chemical this dumbing people
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.320]  down the you know reducing the IQs of children you know the list goes on and
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.800]  on and you've talked about it for years and years what if we could develop a
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.640]  product that would actually help the body detoxify fluoride and you know with
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.880]  the survival shield with the iodine product that we came up with that's
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.000]  great because the iodine saturates the thyroid and it doesn't let the fluoride
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.200]  in but what about something that we could use and take on a regular basis to
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.040]  protect the children and techniques on how to avoid fluoride from coming into
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.920]  the that's right we're gonna talk about that today because we are launching the
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.480]  new product today we're only spent about five minutes on that and get into news
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:52.160]  and analysis folks but this is amazing because Dr. Group off-record said hey
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.840]  when you got to be on coast to coast a.m. or something stay up all night try
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.360]  not drinking coffee try taking a double dose of the iodine it literally is a
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.040]  rain booster for me we'll be right back Alex Jones here and I want to tell you
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.120]  about a longtime friend of the show my Patriots supply as you might remember
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:13.000]  this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA secret plan to

[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.160]  key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow

[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:15.080]  now I want to get into Obamacare with Dr. Ed Rube and all this news where cities
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:20.160]  and counties are pulling flour out of the water in New Jersey and states like
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.520]  Arkansas a whole bunch of them so they're passing federal mandates of money
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.120]  to the states where the state doesn't get the federal money that's really state
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:35.600]  money citizen money if they don't fluoridate so they're passing laws that
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.920]  the water's got to be fluoridated and public schools have to have it when for
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.000]  seven years the American dental association a medical association have
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.040]  said under five don't drink it and I've had arguments with doctors that don't
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:54.280]  know that they look at me oh my god no one told me this so we forced them to
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.600]  say don't drink it and the scientists at the FDA have gone public God bless them
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.320]  again that's an example of good people in government in 2000 and again in 2009
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.520]  90 plus percent of them signed official deals could have been fired and said take
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.920]  it out it's getting people cancer thyroid IQ and they said no so so here's the
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.720]  deal folks I actually got to commend the government scientists trying to get it
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.840]  out it's the citizens sitting down on their butts people should be angry so
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.080]  Dr. Group I want to get into fluoride and all that but you've got the floor we
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:29.160]  are launching fluoride shield fluoride detox but doesn't just detox that
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.400]  and it is the super combo because you already had this idea as you said a
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.560]  couple years ago you were so busy I should also add you're one of the major
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.200]  formulators in the country you yourself have lines of stuff that are your
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.580]  national bestsellers and are really I guess
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:47.120]  nutrimetic I guess they'd call them they're using hospitals you name it but
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.200]  the whole point is is I appreciate you helping us do this because you're on
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.880]  board with the Liberty Movement tell us about how you developed and are allowing
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.800]  us to be the sole proprietary distributor of it fluoride shield tell us
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:04.400]  what's in it just an incredible idea and so I really wanted to put a lot of
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.400]  effort into it and spend a lot of time researching it because ultimately I want
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.320]  to help everybody out just like you and by the way you couldn't get one of the
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:16.600]  agreements I mean ingredients for about six months and this all got held up and
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.840]  I said just take it out you said no I will not put it out unless it's I'm sorry
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.680]  go ahead no that's exactly what it was and the ingredient was she was eating it
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.560]  actually is a black mass it's an organic mass that grows out of the mountains in
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.440]  the Himalayas so they actually have to go up there and harvest it at a certain
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.040]  time of the year it's like a black ooze and they harvest it it's very high in
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.400]  minerals and they've been it's been used in Ayurvedic for thousands and
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.960]  thousands of years it's a miraculous healing compound but it it's high in
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:48.720]  folvic acid and has the ability to help chelate and pull metals and toxic
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.240]  compounds out of the system so that was one of the main ingredients and by the
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.680]  way these ingredients are hard to get I've got organic folvic acid in there
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.600]  I've got tamarin which a lot of people don't know about and that mobilizes
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.040]  metals and fluorides from the body nasonide on tro and then iodine in there
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.400]  as well not a lot like the survival shield but you can actually take the
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.720]  fluoride shield and the survival shield at the same time and you explained how
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.200]  it all triggers it one thing gets it moving the other grabs it explain it
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.720]  yes well it's got zeolites in it too and so basically what we want to do is we
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.120]  want to have take something that's going to target toxic chemicals especially
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:27.880]  fluoride some of it like cilantro is going to mobilize it from the cells and
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.400]  then the zeolites are going to pick it up and the folvic acid is also going to
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:36.320]  chelate it or bond to it so you can extract it normally from the body so
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.680]  you know especially with the dental fluorosis the skeletal fluorosis people
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:46.200]  losing hair arthritis joint pains all over the United States I mean one of
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.840]  the best things when he came up with that idea was like that's great because
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.720]  that's the one thing that you can really turn you around super fast I mean as
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:00.000]  far as health is concerned because you need to be able to understand and have
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.440]  mental clarity if you want to fight against the opposition if you want to
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.560]  fight against everything else and if you want especially with the Obamacare
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.760]  situation right now people need to start taking responsibility for their own
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:13.400]  health they need to start cleaning their body they need to start detoxifying and
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.400]  they need to be aware of the things that they're putting in their system and you
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.640]  warned us on air and you warned me because I took it for several months just
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.440]  the proprietary nascent iodine before we you know actually bottled it and put it
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.400]  out that get ready you may start detoxing and I felt a few weeks into it
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:33.320]  kind of sick for a while a little bit but then it passed like you said and then
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.080]  you said look I'm not gonna say a bunch this on air but just wait what it does
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.560]  your clarity and I guess just the nascent iodine alone I guess stripped out a
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.000]  bunch of stuff that was fogging me up in my glands for lack of a better word
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.200]  lian and said the same thing I mean I literally can be staying up all night I
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.280]  don't drink coffee now I will hit the iodine and of course you got a
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.600]  consultant physician sometimes I take more than what it says recommended you
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.520]  told me privately what you really take I was like man is this guy crazy let me
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.800]  tell you this stuff's amazing well it's easy to tell people to void artificial
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.200]  sweeteners avoid alcohol you know they can avoid it but it's hard to tell people
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.280]  to avoid fluoride because what are you gonna not go out to the restaurant and
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.760]  eat anymore are you not gonna have water anywhere all the foods made with water
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.560]  the soup I mean everything it's hard to avoid fluoride it's in everything so
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.400]  that's why I figured it's a great idea to have a product if someone can take on
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.080]  a regular basis that will actually help them immobilize and eliminate fluoride
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.000]  what is it doing in the brain though for the clarity I mean it's it's amazing
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.800]  what is it's doing is it's decalcifying the pineal gland number one which is
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.920]  bringing your consciousness up and making you more aware and giving you a
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:45.080]  more spiritual connection and then it's undoubted the dreams I'm having I mean
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:48.440]  quite frankly this stuff's amazing I don't know we're gonna be right back but
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.600]  whether that's the old product I'm gonna tell you about the new one we're on the
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.080]  March we're gonna get into everything all the news we're gonna get into all this

[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:06.320]  the fluoride so I sell that I use it and then you can block them put in the
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:11.040]  fluoride in your water and be healthy and we can fund the media operation when
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:16.360]  when when that's just old-fashioned free market good products capitalism you know

[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:28.560]  five great ingredients I'm sick of waiting let's call it you know fluoride
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:34.240]  shield turbo or something once I get the shilligy because he's like well we've
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.280]  got some good shilligy but it's not the best and I wanted this and I'm like look
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.200]  been waiting six months here for this oh and that's the final issue they only
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.760]  got half the shilligy they thought and this is not a advertising tactic though
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:53.160]  it is just you know the truth is what sells but it is true we got a third of
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.720]  what I originally wanted to order and it's gonna be four to six weeks till I
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.480]  get more and so I almost didn't even come out with it just because it's
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.160]  pointless was we're just gonna sell out of it like two days but we have two new
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:12.120]  products super mill vitality and the fluoride shield that will sell out in
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:16.360]  days and we won't have more for four to six weeks okay I mean period period so
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.040]  so I've been wanting to get Dr. Groupon in here anyways so that's it we have
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:28.320]  plenty for now of the survival shield proprietary nation iodine and just to
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.040]  give you an example the other ones which I'm sure great for you and everything
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.200]  are black on paper because they're oxidized mixed with alcohol this is
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.560]  bound up in the non-gmo from Germany glycerin and turns bright blue on
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.760]  paper I'm just I'm just giving out of the differences here just visually what
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:51.920]  goes on and we do have plenty of that info wars life.com or call toll 3888-253-3139
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:58.920]  triple 8253-3139 if you want to call and order it and it's also good to store as
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.760]  well but this is something you take daily consult your physician because a lot
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:07.240]  of you are super toxic like I was I mean this is not a game this is not a joke
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:13.040]  this is real stuff okay and what's blown me away is that I'm like listen group is
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.800]  taken forever let's go find I told group this for somewhere else to put this out
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:22.040]  and I found out the industry is so unbelievable with fillers and all the
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.560]  rest of it that I could get stuff for like two dollars ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.040]  instead of paying 16 you know $20 a bottle myself or something to get the
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.320]  real stuff and I wouldn't did research okay I mean that's the difference with
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.280]  these companies and these fillers and even a lot of the stuff that's seen is
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.760]  super good and wonderful and again I don't need to differentiate the
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:46.200]  competition to sell this stuff I'm telling you folks we're bringing you
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.400]  from our research the very best stuff and I'm done plugging it let's get into
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.200]  fluoride but let's finish up Dr. Group what you were telling me about what
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.240]  fluoride does how it supercharges the body the point is this is available now
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.080]  it'll be the middle of January till we have more of this folks I'm gonna be
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.720]  getting into the supermail vitality we got such a small amount of that and I
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.680]  got and I'll be honest with you folks I took this when we had the formula three
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.640]  months ago for about a month I quit taking it except for about a third of
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.840]  the even recommended dose because I don't need the supermail vitality okay
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.200]  okay I don't need it in the morning if you know what I mean and I'm gonna
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:26.000]  literally start I mean I can't take it okay but for guys out there let me tell
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.200]  you the leading competitors are double the price like a hundred bucks for this
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:35.520]  stuff and our stuff's you know 50 something or 60 something because the
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.120]  ingredients that are in it and I'm telling you I wanted to trial this stuff
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.120]  out other competitors don't do anything or give me a headache this supermail
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.880]  vitality when we finally get enough of it is going to be a market changer okay
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:50.920]  the problem is is that it's so hard to make and again group like why is it so
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.440]  hard to make good stuff and then you've got the floor well because nobody else
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.240]  out there takes the time and effort to research the ingredients and make sure
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:02.000]  that they mix everything correctly that they use cold processing that they use
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.160]  all glass equipment I mean most of stuff out there is done in aluminum based
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.080]  production vessels stainless steel production vessels all that can affect
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.440]  the way that it mixes together people use alcohol extractions which are dated
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:18.480]  back to you know thousands and thousands of years ago no one's
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:24.560]  reinvented the way to process herbs or came up with new technology and utilize
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:29.680]  new technology since we have really I mean and that's like starting from scratch
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.560]  and figuring out how we can extract because see alcohol extractions only
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.120]  get about 40 to 50% of the constituents of the plant out but what kind of pitch
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.400]  is that don't buy this it's too strong I mean I don't know what what is in the
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.240]  supermail vitality separately what's in the mail vitality is a proprietary
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.480]  formula and I developed it because men everywhere experiencing Andrew pause
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.480]  right now there's a put in all the garbage in them when you turn 30 you your
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.200]  body a male their body starts producing more estrogen than testosterone and we
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:03.360]  have a major problem with all the estrogen soy all the phytates the
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.640]  plastics everything that's mimicking estrogen and actually talking about
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:11.360]  fluoride it does the same thing fluoride causes excess aluminum to be put up into
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.560]  the brain which causes problems and fluoride is associated with excess
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.760]  estrogen levels in the body too and fluoride reduces sperm count it reduces
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.520]  the reproductive area well that's why John P. Holdren says they put it in the
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:31.000]  water is from mainly infertility to make you infertile yeah and what we have
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.680]  now is we have two women being two girls being born for every one male so
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:37.280]  they're trying to reduce the amount of males with the fluoride and all the
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:42.000]  other stuff unbelievable with the male vitality that was designed to bring you
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.080]  back to when you were a teenager again bring you back to where you're 18
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:51.240]  regulate and normalize your hormone levels growth why can't I handle it well
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:56.520]  you probably just you already had like a dominant you know testosterone male I
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:01.480]  mean this is for and you know you're only 39 to so anytime after 40 you know
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:05.960]  you're as your levels continue to go and plus you're avoiding the estrogens and
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.000]  I was about to say and I've been exercising I mean I still take it
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.040]  sometimes like in the morning I'm tired don't work out or something it's just
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.400]  that I did get crazed in about three weeks on this well you have to look at
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.440]  your personality and you have to look at what you know if you're having fatigue
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.240]  if you're having extra weight gain like males do around the trunk area if you're
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:26.920]  eating a crappy diet with all kinds of estrogens and stuff like that and you're
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.520]  having you know sexual dysfunction which look at all the men on viagra and
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.000]  everything these days and again I just want to say folks well just just just
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.480]  get the male vitality it's gonna sell itself wait till people try this and
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.160]  put it this way it makes you feel like you're 16 or 17 again and yeah that
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:47.160]  energy boost no I'm just saying I take a lot less of it you were telling me but
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.720]  also we're gonna come out with a female version but quite frankly you were saying
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.560]  women that does the same thing for women I've had women call my office and
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.600]  basically say what are you giving to my husband and do you have some for me
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  because it's completely changed their relationship I mean they're able to have
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:08.400]  sexual relations again they're balanced out I mean the guy is confident about
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.440]  himself because he's gaining muscle he's losing that extra fat he feels young
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:18.800]  again it's all about with health health really is giving you self confidence I
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.720]  mean when you look in the mirror and you look good and you look healthy then
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:24.200]  you're self-confident when you go out into the world when you look in the
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.960]  mirror and you don't look good and you feel bad and you're hungover or anything
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:31.080]  like that you don't have that self-confidence for that day you don't
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.040]  have that drive and that passion to go out into the world and accomplish what
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:38.360]  you want to accomplish and that's why I want to help people detox the floor
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.920]  right and really you know with fluoride it affects babies and affects children
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.440]  and affects older people even worse and you know especially with children and
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:53.960]  mixing the the fluoride fluoridated water in with their baby formulas I mean
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.720]  they get 400 times the amount or at least we did this with natural news editor
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.160]  naturalnews.com Mike Adams where he brought in the leading a few years and
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.000]  we should do this again leading baby formulas they were like 75% sugar and
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.840]  my fructose corn syrup I mean no wonder I mean I've seen the studies where kids
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.400]  that drink formula have smaller brains exactly exactly I mean mental you're
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.960]  meant to be getting fat right from your mama I mean you know in the tests that
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.760]  have come back when they tested breast milk have shown very very very low
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.760]  fluoride levels in there but when you put water and you bathe the children in
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.680]  fluoridated water and you're around it all the time then you're gonna have all
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.880]  this endocrine disorder and you were telling me what fluoride does to other
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:40.480]  things like how it supercharges the uptake of aluminum yeah it supercharges
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.920]  the uptake of aluminum it causes damage to the liver causes damage to the brain
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:51.080]  causes damage to the kidneys it reduces IQ like we talked about it gives you
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.880]  that brain fog it reduces it can cause skin rashes you know people that have
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:58.680]  skin rashes or it can be fluoride sensitive the list goes on and on and on
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.720]  and on but it's just the fact that it chronically suppresses the immune system
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:06.920]  too and that way you can't activate your own body self-healing mechanism which
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.880]  we've talked about a bunch of times it's all about reducing your chemical
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.480]  exposure and cleansing your system on a regular basis cleaning the air cleaning
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.160]  the water you know but the thing is even though people have water
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:23.520]  filtration systems and restaurants sometimes have water filtration systems
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.720]  it's not going to get the fluoride out I mean they're just carbon-based systems
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.200]  you have to have specialized either distillation systems which is why we
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.160]  use on in the production of our products triple distilled water it doesn't get any
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.080]  cleaner than that and then we mix that in a certain percentage with glycerin and
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:42.720]  then we use that as an extraction medium for the herbs or whatever we're
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:46.560]  extracting what is happening because when we sold out of it I looked at it
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.360]  carrying other other so-called nascent iodine and we just couldn't sell it because
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:59.400]  it tasted so bad also well I mean why well what it it tastes and looks like
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:04.040]  it's oxidizing what's happening with iodine that's put in with alcohol that
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:08.880]  makes it black instead of shiny pretty blue on paper I mean you know we've
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.400]  tested multiple different types of iodine by different manufacturers and
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.520]  we're getting different results across the board what the first of all is an
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.840]  ethyl alcohol an ethyl alcohol it might be genetically modified it might not but
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.480]  alcohol is definitely a toxin to the body that's the number one reason why I
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:30.560]  don't like alcohol extractions number two is you're not able to extract or bond
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.800]  the substances into the matrix like you are with glycerin vegetable glycerin is
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.600]  what I'm talking about we would never use animal products but with the glycerin
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.600]  you can actually hold the iodine in the matrix and then when you release it it
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.960]  should turn a purplish color that means that you're releasing free iodine onto
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:53.640]  whatever you want to release it on to so basically with the alcohol based
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.760]  tinctures number one they taste really really bad we don't know what the
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.200]  microgram dose is in some of them they're all different and they're really
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:04.120]  hard to give the children or even pets look I mean you have dogs and cats right
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:09.480]  now practically every dog and cat that's raised on a human diet because people
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:13.820]  give their dog food and the contaminated GMO dog food which is full of
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:17.040]  chemicals and toxic metals and all that stuff to their pets and then their pets
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:21.880]  eat the crappy food they eat pet dogs and cats are having hypothyroidism and
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.520]  hyperthyroidism just like humans you can't give the alcohol based product to
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:32.320]  pets because pets but I just want to be clear this is such a giant country giant
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:35.920]  world we're not in competition with folks other thyroid you know type deals
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:39.320]  and iodine I think it's great get it from you know the the quality gourmet
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:44.960]  salts that have it get it from other nascent items whatever my point is
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.880]  we're explaining why this system is glycerin based right and I'm a big
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.160]  supporter I mean it doesn't really you know if you it's just like if you want
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.760]  to drive a car do you want to drive a Bentley or do you want to drive like a
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.120]  little Volkswagen or something like that or you know it's a matter of looking at
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:04.320]  but if people can't afford it's double the strength that half the price
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:08.840]  leading competitors are our survival shield or our fluoride shield it's in
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:15.080]  the big two ounce bottle by the way they can still get the gourmet salts
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:19.400]  correct that have some of the good iodine in them you can get like Himalayan
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.240]  crystal salt which actually has natural iodine and it's not processed it's not
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.440]  bleached all stuff like that you can eat seaweed organic seaweed of course make
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.920]  sure it's not coming from over there by Fukushima sure but you know there's
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:35.600]  different processing techniques to that we even actually test the raw iodine
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.960]  when it comes in with Geiger counter just to make sure that it's not you know
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.160]  putting out any type of radiation it's just a matter of what steps are you
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.480]  gonna take to ensure that you're giving the highest quality product to
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:50.400]  somebody these days because I spent years looking at all different types of
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.880]  products out there that's my whole life is evaluating and formulating products
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.880]  and getting people the right information that they can trust I've put my name on
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:01.720]  it that means that all of that information has been researched extensively
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:05.640]  and it's a passion of mine just like yours to bring this information out to
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.600]  the public so I want to produce the best product out there and one of the
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.560]  reasons why I started that is because I looked and I couldn't find any good
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.880]  products out there they all have magnesium steroid in them if you track it
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.360]  down they're using herbs that are two or three or four years old it sat in a
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.240]  warehouse with 200 degrees or 150 degrees somewhere or in a shipping
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.720]  container I mean when you really start tracking back take your product off the
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.200]  shelf at any drugstore or major retailer and if you call that company first of
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.720]  all they're probably not even going to give you any information on it and if
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.680]  you really track about some of the biggest companies we were looking at
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:44.800]  private label stuff the bottle costs more than what's in it and I was like no
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:48.520]  we're not going to buy this I mean what is going on out there well because
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:51.360]  everybody wants to produce a cheap product they don't really care about the
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:54.440]  end consumer I mean and that's the good thing about you that's a good thing
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.320]  about me is we actually care about the end consumer I mean I don't want the
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:02.120]  bad luck from selling people stuff that didn't highest quality I mean that's
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:05.720]  like God fearing I don't want to get into pitch in the thing I think I'm not
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:08.480]  even trying to we just whenever we're talking we always talk about this so
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:11.840]  it's kind of inside baseball stuff what do you make of the federal government
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.280]  lobbying states and states passing laws saying cities can't take fluoride out I
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:21.040]  mean for me that is so outrageous why do you think the establishment dr. group
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:26.440]  wants to put hydrofluorosalic acid and other fluorines and the bromine all
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.720]  that they're putting in the bread I mean they've got to know what they're
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:32.600]  doing of course they know what they're doing I mean as whole part of the
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:35.600]  population control scheme is about keeping people dumbed down it's about
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:39.200]  keeping people sick I mean and that's why so we can't be mad at Americans and
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:43.440]  others in the West that are so unhealthy highest cancer rates dying all of that
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.800]  and being zombies we've been poisoned we are being poisoned I mean and that is
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.160]  a super toxic chemical I mean the phosphate industry for fertilizer which
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:56.720]  is a whole nother big scam but they produce they they use the phosphate
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:00.800]  containing rocks they pour sulfuric acid on it they get these chemicals they
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.880]  have it would be more caught it would cost them way more money to dispose of
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:10.640]  this because hydrofluorosalic acid is so toxic it's almost as toxic as arsenic
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:13.960]  with the amount that they're producing for the fertilizer industry and I'm
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.880]  even talking about the aluminum production industry what are they going
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:20.680]  to do with all that stuff and this goes back actually into the early 1900s so
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.360]  they're dumping it in the water supply because they know that it's going to
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:28.800]  kill everybody off eventually it's it's a slow poison it's a slow death and
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:31.520]  again for those that don't know from the aluminum smelting they have it as a
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.840]  byproduct fertilizer but the big one at the end of World War two and they had big
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:38.800]  spills in Tennessee that were killing the whole rivers was the uranium enrichment
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.080]  they mined out of the same limestone they had all this hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.480]  left and they went what do we do from the Manhattan project we put it in the
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.200]  water oh man yeah and what happened was the citizens have actually especially
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.920]  like in San Diego and some in some areas throughout the United States they've
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.360]  have action networks and they fought dating back to the early 1900s and have
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:05.360]  laws in the cities that they cannot fluoridate the water but now what's
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.320]  happening is big brothers coming down and saying to the states you have to you
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.120]  know enforce this fluoridation and the states are actually overturning or
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:17.600]  cutting the funding to these small cities that have not had fluoridated
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.800]  water for hundreds of years exactly making enforcing them to fluoridate the
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.240]  water now well I was about to say when I just happened to be at a hotel and
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:28.560]  we're having a water convention in Arkansas where they passed a law the
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.640]  year before to make you have fluoride and I'm no exaggeration I forget it was
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.320]  like 30 40 I forget I mean had had water guys cool we're big listeners and we
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.400]  don't put it in the water even though they make us buy it we got it it gets
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:44.480]  gotten rid of and it's not only and they were they were all in a conspiracy of
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:50.080]  liberty for their families they were just not doing it see that's how we're
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:52.960]  gonna save people I'm sorry go ahead some well what I'm saying is it's not just
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.280]  the fluorosalic acid that's that's that they're getting from China now
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.280]  shipping over but it's all the arsenic and let's stay there explain that
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.440]  exactly stay there I'm gonna talk about that whether it's natural disasters

[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:10.360]  don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:17.840]  fell into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:20.280]  higher I'm not gonna talk about the products anymore that we just launched
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.680]  super metal vitality in the fluoride shield and of course it pulls out a
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.080]  bunch of other toxins as well but I was asking her in the break and you said
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:32.040]  you know you'll talk about it your super metal vitality that you developed for us
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:35.240]  you're explaining it gets your body to release the testosterone how does it do
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:41.040]  that well what I like to do is formulate stuff that's gonna actually help the body
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.800]  heal itself instead of having somebody that just needs to be on something
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.200]  forever so what that's designed to do since automatically the male body
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:52.200]  quits producing hormones at least testosterone and DHEA and some of the
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:55.640]  male hormones by around 30 to 40 but we're seeing that even younger now
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:59.800]  because of the estrogen dominance what I wanted to do is actually instead of
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:02.840]  like what's going on right now where guys are going to the doctor and they're
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.600]  getting these testosterone shots and all this you know testosterone creams and
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:10.360]  it's altering their hormone levels because they're shooting it into their
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:14.120]  bloodstream what I wanted to do is put stuff together where it was gonna
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.320]  naturally balance out your hormone levels so the mixture of herbs and
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.240]  constituents that I came up with actually increases your testosterone
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:28.600]  levels by let's say 20-25% because it it your body produces more testosterone
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.560]  and it regulates the production of estrogen and again I just want to be
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:37.400]  honest I take like a third of what the recommended dose is growth hormone to
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:42.360]  growth hormone is a major factor and the formula was designed to balance out
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:47.080]  your growth hormone levels as well it's amazing getting back into fluoride what
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.960]  are they gonna do with Harvard studies saying get it out of the water cancer
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.080]  IQ reductions what are they gonna do we put those on screen just Google Harvard
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:59.560]  study IQ how can they keep it in the water when it's totally on record and
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.720]  all their own EPA scientists are saying get it out and FDA if you take a pea
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.920]  size amount of toothpaste you're supposed if you swallow a pea size amount of
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.280]  toothpaste you're supposed to call poison control that's how dangerous it is the
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:18.240]  good news is we are getting more support by consent you know just by the general
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.680]  citizens by getting the information the government I mean you know it's a
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.960]  scientist level says take it out but the politicians won't well that's just
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:28.880]  because that's how the system works I mean they're not they're not gonna take
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:32.080]  it out because they know they don't want a bunch of health healthy people around
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:38.560]  I mean you know hopefully you know there are there is more science leading to the
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.960]  damaging effects of fluoride every single day which is a good thing and
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:45.520]  hopefully in our lifetime hopefully in the next few years we can completely get
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.040]  it out I mean look at all the other countries that don't even Florida
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:52.720]  their water or pulling it Germany England they're pulling it and China
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:57.040]  which is a big manufacturer of arms and everything is shipping us all that that
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.760]  fluoride that toxic fluoride to put in our water systems and they put iodine in
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:06.520]  the water heavily contaminated with I've seen pictures of people at the water
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:10.840]  plants the technicians that add it to the buckets and this thick on the bottom
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.960]  of the bucket they don't even know what it is oh yeah I know that there's local
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:18.200]  newscast of all places Oklahoma did one another I've aired them where they went
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:23.320]  and tested it says fluoride from China and half of it's not even Florida it's
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:27.200]  a mixture of every poison they've gotten China they ship here for the idiot
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.080]  Americans water that's because China gets rid of all their toxic waste by
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:34.800]  shipping it over here all the lead and the arsenic and the cadmium and the
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:38.000]  melamine and the babies everything they just ship it over here they say well
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.880]  we mostly you know that's all statistic that 90 plus percent of pharmaceuticals
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:46.840]  are made in China including a lot of the vitamins that's right that's right and
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:50.280]  there's a lot of counterfeiting going on over in China too there's counterfeiters
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:53.320]  out there right now that are taking popular products they're getting a
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:56.880]  manufactured in China they're putting the exact label on them and they're
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:00.480]  selling them on Amazon and selling them through eBay so if you're looking for a
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:03.720]  good quality product out there make sure you go to the source or make sure you
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.280]  go to someone reputable because these counterfeiters are out there and

[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:15.040]  nutrition and supplement industry is is growing at a rapid rate because people
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:17.720]  don't want to have to rely on their doctors anymore

[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:12.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:20.160]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:32.280]  Alex Jones. Dr. Russell Blaylock medical doctor getting into Obamacare and he
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:36.240]  predicted exactly how it would be implemented what would happen I thought
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.240]  that he was a little severe I didn't imagine they would be this brutal Dr.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:44.480]  Group they're trying to break this country right now and the reason they're
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.960]  claiming that the sites broken on purpose is because they don't want people to
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:53.400]  know that Obamacare is such a screw job because it's written that way and that
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:57.320]  your premiums are going up because the sites broken I mean it really they
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:01.200]  really are con artists and the average even politician I get on who's smart
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:07.240]  cannot comprehend that things this diabolical what do you think's going on
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:12.240]  with Obamacare? I think it's a disaster but I think it's actually can be a good
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.520]  thing because I think that the way that you can look at it good is the more
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.280]  that it's a disaster the more that people are going to look for other
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.560]  options for health care if they look for other options like preventative care
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.800]  like what everybody should be doing taking care of their own health it's
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:33.920]  very easy to maintain yourself in a healthy state don't put toxic chemicals
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.800]  in your body don't eat bad food don't eat GMOs avoid all the everything that
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.640]  can cause disease and then you don't even need to worry about Obamacare I
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.120]  mean all that you know again even with Obamacare they're still treating the
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:49.240]  symptoms and not the root cause I mean everybody needs to figure out what's
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:53.120]  causing my health I mean you address that you drink a bunch every day you
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:56.320]  smoke you eat at McDonald's you wonder why you weigh 400 pounds and die of
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:00.080]  cancer at 50 I mean it's not that hard I mean you take a shower every day to
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:03.360]  wash the outside of your skin what do you do to clean the inside of your body
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.080]  because if your body's not clean inside then you're gonna get you're gonna start
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:09.880]  out with headaches you're gonna start out with joint pain you're gonna start out
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.480]  with all these things your body is telling you something is starting to
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:16.920]  happen you don't just all of a sudden get something it's a it takes a while
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:19.480]  time you might gain a little weight you might have high blood pressure you might
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:23.320]  be having signs of diabetes then you run to the doctor at the hospital or with
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:26.920]  Obamacare whatever and you get put on medications half those medications are
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:31.040]  gonna cause more they're all gonna cause more damage medications cause damage all
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:34.800]  that Obamacare is it's just a sick care system all they do is just want to keep
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.880]  you sick want you to die earlier they want to control your you know they want
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.200]  you to die before you get the Medicare and Medicaid and the Social Security and
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:47.360]  by the way they admit that now the architect Ron manuals brother Ezekiel
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.560]  said no we're gonna bankrupt the system that's the plan yeah and we do have
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:54.320]  death panels me my whole thing is I hope it even backfires even more because
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:57.440]  what we've seen is we've had actually people calling us up and say look I
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.120]  can't do Obamacare I don't even want to do Obamacare I have doctors that are
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:05.320]  asking me what to do for their patients naturally because they're getting out of
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:10.160]  Obamacare I mean we have a big-time backlash right now and what I project
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.200]  is there's nowhere else to go but to natural medicine I mean that's the
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.920]  only true way to heal the body is naturally you're not going to go
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:20.720]  anywhere and you're not going to get better in the Obamacare system look
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:23.880]  with the health care system is done to this point we have more diabetes more
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.320]  heart disease more cancer everything exponentially in fact for
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.360]  blalock guys will you find the Ezekiel Emanuel deal I know we've heard that 10
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:36.840]  times but but but I mean it's just amazing we got one minute left Dr. Group

[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:12.040]  economy from them with quality and displace their fraud just like you
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:15.720]  couldn't get organic 15 20 years ago people started buying it it was
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:19.360]  expensive it displaced the other stuff now organic is coming down to the same
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:22.960]  price as the poison food because we took over the market then it brought in
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:25.960]  more competition yep and that's it and that's what's happening we've watched it
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:29.000]  happen it's just people need to you know people are getting slapped in the face

[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:40.120]  what's really good about it is the fact that we're able to help more people
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:43.320]  every single day and each person that gets help that doesn't have to be on
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:47.120]  prescriptions or gets off their prescription medications less money for

[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:41.480]  Blalock is our guest for the next 52 minutes or so Blalock Wellness Center
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:46.680]  comm is his amazing website and I gush over some of my guests that have been
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:52.400]  so accurate but I've got to say with Dr. Blalock five years ago four years ago
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:58.040]  during the whole H1N1 hoax he was so on target that it would make you get the
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.440]  regular flu that that that it would paralyze people and he got attacked
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:07.440]  nationally and then he got proven completely right he just has a lot of
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.160]  courage and he travels the world speaking to groups of scientists and
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.080]  medical doctors he is a retired board certified neurosurgeon and of course
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:23.520]  professor who talked brain surgery and he invented many forms of brain surgery
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.720]  and procedures so he's a brain surgeon brain surgeon got the term hey I'm no
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:31.960]  brain surgeon but I know you know Obama's a liar but I mean he is a brain
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:37.240]  surgeon and you know my dad is a dentist an oral surgeon and managed 22
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:44.080]  clinics and then help manage nationally for another a medical firm and he was
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.480]  telling me the same stuff last few years that Blalock was and my dad did get out
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:53.480]  of medical management two months ago in fact the week of Obamacare he said
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:58.320]  they are criminally trying to wreck it they have come to us and said play ball
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.400]  with Obama and do what we say and you can do whatever you want and with certain
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:06.800]  h.m.l. insurance companies my dad said this is mafia and my dad and I'm only
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:11.560]  I'm 40 in two months folks my dad's only like 63 my dad could have kept working
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:15.360]  another decade he's in great shape and loves working he said I'm not he goes
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:18.600]  I'm not gonna be involved in something where they can put me in jail and he
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.800]  had to testify at the legislature they were going into other medical groups
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:27.160]  that he didn't work for but he had to go and defend them and literally arresting
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:32.080]  heads of the companies and stuff for a T not being crossed and shutting down the
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:37.640]  healthcare chains you know non-dental medical stuff criminally wrecking it and
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:45.000]  and dr. Blalock six years ago when Obama was running four years ago three years
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.560]  ago when they passed Obamacare six months ago on the show he was saying stuff so
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:53.600]  horrible about it and I did scan over the bill and the 10,000 pages of writers
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:57.600]  and I knew it was there but he was saying stuff so horrible that I thought
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:01.400]  maybe it's not that bad because how will they get away with it everything he
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.200]  said came true is coming true and now he's gonna tell you because he told us
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:10.720]  then what was gonna come up next and folks I don't have the staff to do this
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:14.960]  you've got to go pull up dr. Russell Blalock Alex Jones search it in YouTube
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.440]  you'll get him six months ago a year ago three years ago four years ago six
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:22.120]  years ago saying they're playing as he's read all their books he's followed how
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:28.000]  socials health care is rolled out with the fascist above it and he is now here
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.240]  to break down their plan he said it's not gonna work it's gonna wreck everything
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:33.960]  it's gonna double triple prizes and then they're gonna claim it's just I mean he
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:40.160]  literally knows more than anybody I've talked to about Obamacare okay so he's
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:45.360]  got the floor for the next 50 minutes that's a long intro but we either defeat
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:50.120]  this or it's meant to bring down America this is a cloud and piven bankruptcy
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.560]  plan to domesticate us and dr. Blalock I want you to recap how you knew how bad
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.920]  it would be what you think of where it's going people call it a disaster you
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:03.000]  said they were gonna call it that that it's a plan so no one knows more about
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.480]  this than you and again I'm not trying to kiss your buddy or it's true you
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.680]  absolutely have been a hundred percent on target how are you so on target
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:17.640]  compared to everybody else well Alex I spent most of my adult life staying
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:24.480]  collectivist system socialism fascism national socialism communism Marxism
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:32.240]  womenism I've read a considerable amount of not only in books and testimony before
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:39.560]  Congress and investigating committees it has taken me a lifetime to get a grasp
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:45.480]  of how this system works what they want how they attain what they want and
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:54.880]  there's a very brilliant writer Gerhard Neimer who has studied this his entire
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.840]  life and what he shows that all revolutionary systems the first step
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:04.400]  that you have to take is to bring in the revolution you have to destroy
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:10.440]  everything that existed before because it's a total critique of society and if
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:14.640]  you look at the socialist communist systems around the world that's
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:20.160]  essentially what was done now some of the liberal groups the the liberal
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:27.360]  socialist softer forms of Marxism womenism they try to merge pre-existing
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:33.560]  society with the newer revolutionary concept and that's more of a
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:40.400]  transitional stage and what we see is that the ultimate plan is total
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:47.000]  replacement of the old world order now you remember when Bush made his
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:53.320]  announcement for the UN that we were bringing in a new world order well when
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:57.640]  you bring in a new world order that means you have to dismantle the old world
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:04.120]  order so when you look at what they've done and during this administration and
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:08.520]  the Clinton administration going back quite a few years but particularly it's
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:14.040]  ramped up a lot recently when you look at that what you see is the dismantling
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:19.200]  of all our institutional systems that were based on the founding of this
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:25.080]  republic including the economic system the cultural system the moral basis of
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:31.640]  America it's Christian heritage everything is being dismantled the plan
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:36.400]  for replacing that of course has been written hundreds of years ago it's been
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:42.640]  a piecemeal plan and if you read their literature you know not the not the
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:46.240]  conservative literature not the opposition literature but read their
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:51.600]  literature they outline these things quite plainly what they plan to do
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:58.240]  population control reduced birth rates eliminate large percentages of the
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:03.640]  population total regulation of all individuals destruction of the concept
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:09.080]  of an individual which is the very basis of collectivism and when you look at all
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:14.200]  of this and and medical care systems one of the things I looked at I looked at the
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:19.600]  English transition to national healthcare and what a disaster it turned
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:30.520]  into and I tried to warn my colleagues 20 years ago 25 years ago I explained to
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:37.440]  them the history of how England lost its medical care system its free system
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:43.640]  most refused to listen they made the very same mistakes the British positions
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:49.200]  made they thought they were too smart to be fooled by the politicians then there
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.640]  was a group that thought well the politicians would be reasonable and if
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:56.280]  we could sit down with them and negotiate with them and help them control
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:02.200]  costs and if they saw that we were honest and really trying to help then
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:06.440]  they would work with us some of them thought well if we get on the committees
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:12.680]  of these various national socialist medical groups we can help mold it and
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:16.840]  protect the position exactly you just hit the key on every front good people
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:21.560]  think the systems like them and think that they can negotiate with it and then
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:25.400]  with a Delphi technique the collectivists play along with that but
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:29.600]  literally behind closed doors in their own literature they admit they're just a
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:35.280]  criminal group but but please continue sorry well you know that this is the
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.080]  methodology that has been used in virtually every country that eventually
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:44.920]  slides into socialism is that you've got to do this slow dismantling of
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:50.600]  everything that exists and you have to treat people you know there's a great
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:57.800]  writer a writer that was from Poland and he wrote a book called a captive mind and
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:03.960]  anything described was called the Ketman and he said the Ketman was a very
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:11.280]  old concept in the Arab world in which when you wanted to defeat an enemy you
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:14.920]  pretended you were his friend you pretended you to believe what he believed
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:20.600]  and you associated with him and he would move up in his his power structure
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:25.680]  because he thought you were with him and shared his philosophy and he said the
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.120]  whole time it's a deception so that when you finally get strong enough then you
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:35.120]  crush him and that's the Ketman technique well that's what basically used
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:40.080]  is the British system the British politician went to the position made
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:44.320]  the position think that he was his friend they would work with him that he
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:50.520]  have him on panels making decisions and of course if you read the people the
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:54.920]  Naurin Bevan who was one of the chief architects of the British healthcare
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:18:02.000]  system at that time it was all a ruse the idea was to dismantle the existing
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.520]  medical care system of course there was one disaster after another and it's still
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:09.480]  a disaster and then they use the disasters they create to get more power
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:14.440]  each time and they even write that in their books I mean take the arrogance
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:18.120]  and we're gonna play the clip after the break Dr. Blalock joins us here really
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.880]  one of the greatest minds when it came to predicting and now being accurate
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:26.080]  about Obamacare he'll tell us where it's gonna go now and his ideas to reverse
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:30.600]  this and defeat it that's why he's really here today but look at the main
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:35.200]  architect of it the eugenicist Ezekiel Emanuel the brother of the White House
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:39.320]  Chief of Staff who said you know create the crisis basically he said of course
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:43.400]  we're gonna bankrupt healthcare and that was the plan and and now now that
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:47.120]  they've done it they always go of course there's death panels of course we want to
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:50.960]  wreck things well I want to slap their butt in jail with handcuffs they're
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.880]  admitting to their fraud why are they so arrogant Dr. Blalock well the arrogance
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:01.720]  come from the fact of their power they essentially own the media you know
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:08.240]  through their influence they own a great deal of the publishing and so the
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:12.440]  opinion-making in America is being manipulated controlled by them so they
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:17.280]  feel a sense of absolute power that there's very little of the average
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:22.680]  American can do to resist and of course most of America is being entertained
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:26.160]  to death they're watching football and they're watching movies and they're
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:30.720]  playing video games and they're not really studying and paying attention to
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:34.480]  what's happening this is one of the reasons you know people ask her well
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.240]  you're a conspiracy theorist and I said well you know there's two people that
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:45.000]  would make such a statement a negative statement about conspiracy ideas one as
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.560]  a person who's an ideologue and doesn't want to believe it and the other is the
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:53.760]  person that's totally uneducated they're not looking at the issues they're not
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:58.040]  trying to connect the dots they're not studying deeply all of these events and
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:05.480]  so they don't even know what's occurring or a logical analysis of the event so
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:09.320]  but that's your two basic groups that would make such a statement and the
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:13.720]  other thing yet realized well who created this idea that anybody believes in a
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:20.360]  conspiracy is on the French well as the conspirators they control a great deal
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:25.360]  of the media a great deal of publishing movies and so they put out the idea and
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:30.920]  hammered it home repeatedly they believe in conspiracies you're crazy of course
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:36.200]  you know you've quoted before even that Rockefeller himself said if I'm accused
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:40.520]  of conspiracies and doing these things it's true I am that's right in his own
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:45.320]  book written by him that came out in 2004 reflections by David Rockefeller
[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:48.680]  let's pull up the quote he said yeah I'm conspiring to set up a planetary world
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:54.560]  government run by private interest and if you read some of the newer books that's
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:01.880]  been written on these very rich power elite quotes in the book repeatedly they
[02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:06.640]  say that you know we should rule the world of course this comes from Plato you
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:10.880]  know if you look at any history that's where it all comes from Plato all Plato
[02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:15.480]  man that guy is so influential but expanding on that dr. Blalock my big
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:18.640]  issue is if they just wanted to dumb down and kill off the poor I would be
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:23.240]  against it because that's immoral and always leads to other stuff but because
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.840]  you know they teach positive and negative eugenics in school but we all know
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:29.960]  there's the real social engineering eugenics that the inner members of this
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:34.240]  Jacobin program that goes back to France picking up Plato's ideas you know
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:39.320]  God two hundred and something years ago but their biggest crime is they're
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:43.960]  actually targeting the intelligent and the and the pure and the virtuous and
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:50.240]  really want to build a very ugly world and really just love dominating they're
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:54.640]  really a bunch of sadists and are fundamentally evil psychopaths and
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:22:01.720]  sociopaths attracted to the machinery of playing God and are anathema I mean
[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:06.560]  let's talk about that let's talk about their philosophy from your deep research
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:11.400]  where Obamacare is how how well you think their programs going because I
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:15.160]  think they've overdone it a little too much they're wrecking things so fast I
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:20.400]  think it's really starting to backfire and is there a way to beat them well
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:23.920]  yeah you know that I think what people need to understand is like I said this
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:29.800]  is a total critique of society this is a racing the old order this Obama plan
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:37.280]  was designed to be a massive failure and what you're gonna hear next is well
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:42.760]  you know we tried to do it the free market way we tried to mix government
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:47.920]  with free market to make it is as palpable to the conservatives as possible
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:55.680]  but look what a mess it makes you just can't mix government control with the
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:59.920]  private market individual interest in greed because it created this this
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:05.240]  horrible mess that we're experiencing with this affordable care act so this
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:10.600]  is this is to demonstrate to the public you can't mix the two and the next step
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:14.640]  is well what we need to do is scrap the whole thing and have a single payer
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:20.880]  system which is the national health care system we've been candid in England
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:24.800]  another country which has been even a bigger disaster but this is the way to
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:30.400]  bring it in to demonstrate to the public you can't mix capitalism with with
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:37.600]  government control that the only efficient and just way to do it is have
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:42.480]  government totally in control so I think they're sabotaging their own system I
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:47.200]  think it was built to fail they knew all this they built their website so it
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:54.800]  would not work they've particularly designed the health care bill so that it
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:58.520]  would throw people out of work it would make people become and by the way let me
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:01.720]  just interrupt you I'm gonna give our listeners an assignment a liberty
[02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:06.080]  assignment because I literally don't have the crew to do this you said this four
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:11.680]  years ago and a year ago and six months ago the videos are on YouTube with
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:15.160]  hundreds of thousands of views each I want listeners we'll put it on info
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:20.520]  wars.com to go back and watch and listen to that and cut in where you said this
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:26.320]  years ago you're not just saying this now you literally said it will wreck
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:30.840]  everything on purpose it none of it will work it'll be a total disaster and
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:34.440]  then they'll bring in even more control and give the government dictatorial
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:38.880]  power over health care to quote fix it and now they say in the news make Obama
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:45.600]  a dictator so he can fix the health care you literally predicted it and it proves
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.080]  it's a criminal conspiracy because it's not just you predicting it they've had a
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:53.120]  bunch of administration people including Emmanuel we're gonna play the clip now
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:57.600]  come out and and basically say well yeah the insurance companies know we're
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:02.000]  gonna get rid of individual health care and bring in the you know national
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:07.720]  system so so they're admitting the criminal plan and it's only myself and
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:13.000]  you and a few others saying this and I watch the news and they're debating a
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:18.520]  deck chairs on the Titanic let's play the guy that helped write the bill the
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:24.880]  eugenicist the brother of the Chicago mayor Ezekiel Emmanuel on Fox here it is
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:27.880]  people who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:30.800]  telling the truth the grandfather provision written into the law itself
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:35.000]  was too narrow and frankly they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.080]  people out of the individual market they want the people to go into the
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:41.400]  exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual market the whole
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:44.680]  point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market over
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:51.440]  time insurance company people into the insurance companies don't like the
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:55.580]  individual market as it's constructed they see the future that individual market
[02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:58.880]  is going away they don't want to invest in it but that's why president let me
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:05.720]  finish and just goes on and on I mean this is so sick and they calmly sit up
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:12.120]  there and take over everything and wreck it I mean foreign air forces bombing us
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:15.800]  couldn't couldn't couldn't hurt us this bad a dr. Blay like I'm sorry go ahead
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:21.000]  and make your point about their program well I told the physicians in my
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:26.560]  hospital 25 years ago I see that you know you're being tricked what you you're
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.080]  being made to think that these people are reasonable and want to work with you
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:34.760]  and that they're truly interested in getting people good health care and
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:39.800]  making it affordable that's you that's your basic mistake because if you read
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:45.680]  the architects of this in England and other places you find out they have no
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:53.280]  interest whatsoever in health care itself or and being reasonable they have a
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:59.880]  plan in mind which is the total control collectivization of humankind erasure
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:08.360]  of the individual and creating this absolute control system anything they
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:14.520]  do to work with you put you on panels and recommend recommendations from you
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:21.240]  it's nothing but a far and all of that's come true and a lot of them began to
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:24.680]  wake up and called me later and said you know you were right that they've
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:29.600]  destroyed all of our practices they turned us into criminals we're scared to
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.960]  death we don't know what to do we're afraid to practice medicine and of
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:39.440]  course that's what you do you know you you make it where the individual no
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:44.640]  longer wants to be an individual he wants to be a collective they literally
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:50.840]  come to the physician managers for those that don't know and say give money to
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:55.440]  the Democratic Party get in bed with us you can do whatever you want I mean
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:01.600]  these are mafia well you know that the collective this idea is that if you'll
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:06.880]  you'll give up some of your rights we'll protect you but you have to act as a
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:12.640]  collective not individual you know the enemy of socialism as individualism
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:17.920]  they don't think that the average person and that includes you know college
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.920]  graduates PhDs a lot of intelligent people they don't think that you're
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:27.400]  smart enough to be able to conduct your own individual business but there's the
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:32.160]  elites that know far greater than you would ever know and they know what's
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:39.240]  best for everyone and this is the danger of centralization and socialism is that
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:44.800]  the individual is just a cog in the wheel of the machinery of the state and if
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:50.240]  you're a cognizant against the smooth running of the machine they file you
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:55.280]  down they destroy the individual so that you know people need to understand
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:29:00.480]  this is a war against individuals you hear Hillary Clinton talk about the
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:04.320]  village the child is to be raised by the village if you read their literature
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:11.920]  they constantly talk about the mass man the collective the greater good the
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:16.800]  individual is the enemy of socialism so these people out here these libertarians
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:22.840]  all these little college students who are so enraptured with this president we
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:29.000]  have most of these kids don't want their parents telling them what to do they
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.640]  weren't don't anyone telling them how to dress you know they're in their private
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:38.920]  lives want to be total individuals yet they're working tirelessly to create a
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:44.120]  collectivist system where they'll be told everything unbelievably well said

[02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:06.640]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:10.800]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:14.360]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:18.360]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:23.200]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:27.600]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.120]  again folks he said over and over again in the last six years since Obama got
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:48.720]  into office when this goes in it's gonna wreck everything on purpose it's meant
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:51.840]  to be a disaster the big insurance companies like it because they're the
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:55.240]  globalist that want collectivism because this shuts down all their
[02:33:55.240 --> 02:33:58.840]  competition allows them to cut the quality of care charge you whatever you
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:03.200]  want they sit offshore and get the money so it's socialism and communism on the
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:07.800]  bottom fascism on the top and then they can carry out their eugenics they can the
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:11.720]  death panels remember they made jokes about it and so there's no death panels
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:15.080]  and then as soon as it passed they had the case for killing granny and Newsweek
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:19.160]  and said yeah we are gonna kill people I mean the social health care system in
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:24.040]  Europe chops women open to steal their babies a month early with cesarean
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:29.520]  sections so that the woman from Italy who was visiting England can't get away
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:34.720]  I mean the government is out of control because when there's no checks and balances
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:40.680]  every criminal interest out there can basically get away with anything they
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:49.200]  want it is totally and completely absolutely out of control ladies and
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:55.960]  gentlemen and it is so frustrating to see things like this going on and to see
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:02.240]  us in the grip of these con artists who then screw things up on their own record
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:06.040]  and then give us more power will fix it under bloke you were talking about the
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:09.960]  young trendies at the colleges that want socialism communism collectivism
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:16.600]  feel like they're part of the power structure who are literally letting
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:20.280]  Jeffrey Dahmer into their house said please continue sir you've got the floor
[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:25.440]  well you know you've got to go deeper everybody you know that I listen to
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:30.680]  they start screaming about Obama this Obama that and I constantly bring them
[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:36.000]  back I said you've got to quit blaming Obama for creating this this guy's not
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:41.400]  smart enough to create anything all this blabber we're real about what a
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:46.560]  brilliant man is he's not that smart he's smart like a fox but he's an
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:50.800]  entertainer he's like Clinton you remember Clinton he openly said I don't
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:56.600]  care to be president I like to play and that's what Obama does he plays golf
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:02.080]  because of vacations he's being fed this all of this material that we're
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.560]  talking about the destructive program they were hatched in tax free
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:14.000]  foundation bill to burger CFR decades before I mean no serious scholar would
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.360]  think that this bill was in any way written by Obama or that it was written
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:25.320]  within the last two years or four years it was written decades ago they've been
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:30.600]  working on this and molding this for a very long time now what happens if you
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:37.840]  look at well who who makes up the board of the tax free foundation who makes up
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:43.320]  the bulk of the members particularly the central controlling members of CFR
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:50.080]  bill to burger and trilateral Commission it's all CEOs of big companies make up
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:56.240]  the vast majority of membership multinational corporation head and
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:37:02.040]  multinational media head it's very powerful what most conservatives would
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:08.040]  think of as capitalists well they're not capitalists in the strict sense they
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:11.920]  don't even like capitalism this is one of the things that took me many years to
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:19.600]  understand multinational corporations detest capitalism they like control they
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:24.840]  like things be regulated and they learned a long ago the best way to do that is by
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:30.520]  influencing government putting people in government that you could control most
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:35.960]  of these bills we see like this affordable care act came from tax free
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:41.160]  foundations and and special foundations and council and foreign relations
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:46.240]  committees on medical care that's where these things are born they're written
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:54.480]  they have armies of scholars working on all the details we delude ourselves to
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:58.920]  think this is all coming from government it's not it's coming from
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:04.040]  multinational corporations people worth billions hundreds of billions of
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:10.280]  dollars these are the controllers the manipulators the creators of all of this
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:16.240]  this destructive collectivism that we're suffering up you look at every every
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:23.400]  system whether it be the Soviet Union Nazi Germany fascist Italy Cuba behind
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:28.200]  all of those with these people in the shadows with them the massive wealth who
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.680]  were promoting it encouraging it covering for it writing all of the
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:39.680]  programs for it it's not some crazy revolutionary dressed in fatigue you know
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:44.520]  no one of any real sophistication would believe that and if you read the
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:50.520]  literature carefully and deeply do your research and quit piddling with
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:55.240]  entertainment nonsense because we're in a serious period here if you do you
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:00.720]  research use your logic connect the dots it'll be like a light came on you'll
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:06.400]  begin to see things and then you as you do as you understand it deeply you can
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:11.000]  predict things things start making sense because you've seen it before it's not
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.960]  that I have some great predictive prophetic power it's that I've read
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:20.360]  deeply and how all of these systems came about I know their methodology
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:25.800]  I know what they're doing I've read their literature I go on these sites of the
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:32.840]  tax-free foundation read their their statements and and plans for the future
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.920]  and so pretty well know what they're they're planning for the world well one
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:44.320]  of them is use the medical care system to reduce the number of elderly elderly
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:50.640]  are extremely expensive for a society and so they hatched a lot of plans to
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:58.320]  deny health care and encourage that the early demise of the elderly well at the
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.760]  same time they're deceiving the elderly to believing that this is that the
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.480]  government officials and these people in the shadows are their best friends
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:11.120]  because they're giving them free health care but if you look at the Canadian
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:17.120]  health care system for instance the average family of man and woman and two
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:22.800]  children are paying eleven thousand five hundred dollars in taxes far greater
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:28.760]  than they pay for private insurance and when you look at what they're getting
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:34.160]  for what they're paying it's a fraction of the care we get under the the
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:41.600]  American system so Canadians are denied health care it takes four months to have
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:48.040]  elective surgery even longer for some cases some cases are totally denied and
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:52.880]  this is the things we don't hear about well you're buying into that people these
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.920]  elderly who like Medicare and Medicaid and all of these things so well that's
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:01.560]  just it that's the candy that attracts you once you're in the system then it
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:08.280]  starts start the rationing every socialist system goes through a prolonged
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:13.960]  stage of progressive intense rationing which means denying care a recent
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:19.480]  study in England show that they're killing over 10,000 people a year by
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:26.680]  restricting and and refusing health care mainly to the elderly so you know
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:30.440]  you need to quit listening to this left-wing nonsense you hear on the
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:35.800]  major network which is nothing but idiotic propaganda and start doing your
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:41.160]  own research start looking deeply into this and educating your children you
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.800]  know yeah you said what can we do about this well education plays a big part
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:51.320]  because first you have to understand what's going on the methodology that
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:55.480]  they're going to use and that they're using it's the only way to fight it and
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:41:58.760]  you've got to educate your children you can't just send them off to a
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:03.840]  university and they come back this brainwashed left-wing radical extremist
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:10.640]  and unfortunately most parents are not equipped to combat that they did when
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:15.320]  their children come home spewing all this Marxist-Leninist talk the parents
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:18.640]  don't know how to refute it because they don't really understand the American
[02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:23.960]  system they don't understand the free market they don't understand the
[02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:28.160]  dangers of centralization and collectivism well I've learned about this
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:30.920]  firsthand where I've worked with people that claim that they're kind of
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:35.400]  libertarian liberals and you find out later they're actually Marxist and they
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.640]  will lie they will cheat they will do anything and it's really a criminal
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.520]  energy I don't even call them liberals they're authoritarians claiming to be
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:49.120]  liberals they're parasites and the Republican leadership obviously has
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:53.640]  bought and paid for by the same big corporate interest but historically these
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:57.000]  big corporate interests that work with collectivists to get control of
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.640]  civilizations for markets they end up getting their throat slit as well I
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:06.080]  mean I just don't understand this fascination with evil and now how
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:11.800]  they're announcing the euthanasia the fourth euthanasia the the shutting down
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:17.240]  of the doctors I mean it really is a horrible system how do we reverse this
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:20.280]  because they've got our kids in the public schools get the kids out of the
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:26.040]  schools as you just said dr. Blalock but you foresaw exactly how it would be
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:32.120]  implemented with just stunning accuracy to the T so a what is the state of it
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.000]  how is their takeover going how is their dismantling going be how do we
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.960]  reverse it what's coming next if we don't reverse it I mean give us your
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:45.240]  perspective your diagnosis well it's much further advanced than most people
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:54.000]  that realize we're very close to a totalitarian system the takeover of
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:59.360]  America people don't understand since we were the the leading power in the
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:06.240]  world this is the plumb that the these collectivists have always wanted if they
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:10.520]  take America they own the world because most of the rest of the world is
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:17.880]  dependent on the United States the United States has always been the resistance
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:23.840]  to this collectivist way taking over the world now if you look at Europe a lot
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:29.360]  of Europeans are starting to wake up they're fed up with collectivism they
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:35.640]  want individual rights and freedom they're seeing the collectivist welfare
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:42.600]  state and what it does to human being how it destroys lives it destroys family
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:47.320]  it destroys society so they're they're ready for something different they just
[02:44:47.320 --> 02:44:52.720]  don't know how to do it because this generation in Europe a great number of
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:58.840]  them have never lived in a in a free society a truly free society and what
[02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:03.240]  the the enemy's hope is that if they can take the United States it'll stop this
[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:09.000]  reversal that's starting to take place in Europe and unfortunately the
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:16.720]  Americans are some of the most zealous Marxist-Leninists they're the
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:23.080]  collectivist that think they're leading the vanguard and the attitude of the
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:26.880]  intellectual in America is that well the rest of the world messed up
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:31.880]  collectivism because they're not smart like us we're in a we're American then
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:36.720]  we can make it work that was my next point is that there for 200 years since
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:41.960]  the Jacobins in France as you know are 220 years or so they've been trying to
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:47.600]  make it work but that's their mid-level and low-level people getting into the
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:51.520]  deeper writings of the higher-level collectivist they're always totally
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:58.160]  mentally ill into the occult just really bad people that are attracted to power
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:03.720]  well you always see that you know if you study as some of the great work has
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:07.520]  been written on the psychopathic personality what they tell you the
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:13.320]  psychopath gravitate toward positions power because that's what he likes he
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:18.720]  wants to control people he has no empathy has no compassion so if you look at
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:23.720]  percentages of psychopaths they're much higher in the larger megatropolis than
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:28.760]  they are in small cities because that's where the power is well the psychopath is
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:35.000]  also attracted to organizations that have great power in the world the more
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.120]  power the more you're going to see a higher percentage of psychopathic
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:43.800]  personality some of the things I've heard it would be shocked because I you
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:48.720]  know travel among people sometimes that are quite powerful and wealthy that
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:53.400]  they're not on our side and they're quite candid and the things they say is
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:57.960]  shocking they would never say it publicly but hearing them say things
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:05.280]  about all the you know we should sterilize all the old the old people I mean the
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:09.120]  poor people we should kill all the old people you know they're worthless we
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:16.000]  should have a certain age after 55 or 60 where you're automatically killed I mean
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.720]  things they're just shocking and of course they don't include themselves in
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:24.080]  any of these these programs they're always they are fundamentally greedy and
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:31.000]  hateful and wear it like an armor and I know high-level medical doctors do you
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  get into those high-level circles I've talked to other medical doctors that
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:38.080]  treated royalty you name it and the stuff that they hear but my shelf I've
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:42.840]  been approached you know off record for business deals radio deals TV stuff and
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:45.120]  people said why don't you tell us who did it well it was under confidence if I
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:49.840]  ever violated confidence it's like a doctor or patient or lawyer client you
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.240]  don't in the media you don't violate a confidence unless it's a total criminal
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:58.640]  action then you have to but the point is I don't give up sources and they're
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:02.240]  point blank they go listen the fact that you understand this means you should be
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:05.280]  one of us and of course that's how they say it to everybody and the public are
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:09.240]  animals they're scum they want to be slaves you're never gonna help them
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:13.920]  they'll tear you apart if you ever and in a way they've turned the public into
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:17.560]  that and I get that that's partially true but it doesn't matter they're even
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:22.320]  worse and I had the head of one of the big six banks I was on a first-class
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:25.800]  airline thing to New York and he was on that he was visiting his dad who's a
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:30.600]  retired general in San Antonio as people could figure out who it is they doing a
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.440]  free search and he said off record buddy yeah we're setting up a private
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:37.480]  corporate world government and the people don't care and that's why they
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.360]  deserve it and you know you'd be well-served join the right team and
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:44.920]  they'll just adapt to our tyranny you understand you ever think of that Alex
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:48.520]  that that you say people can adapt to overcome how about they adapt to what
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:52.600]  we're doing to them they'll put up with anything and I had this epiphany and
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:56.840]  this guy was perfectly sharp super smart had evil intelligence in his eyes
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:01.080]  got up after a three-hour flight suit was perfect put on a black overcoat
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:05.520]  looked like a guy out of a movie and he just laughed at me and it was just like
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:11.920]  man I have just flown with the devil and it's just they're so inhuman sure
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:18.280]  well you know we've seen this repeatedly it anybody who's read the history of
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:24.000]  revolution you see these these personalities they have no considerations
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:31.160]  but the public goal I'm sure you've seen the interview Rousseau did with one
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:35.560]  of the Rockefeller and he told him he said well you know you just will give
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:40.120]  you some identification and you'll be with us and you'll be protected he said
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:45.600]  well what about all the other people he said what do you care about them so you
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:50.640]  see this callousness you know one of the things I look on the internet and I
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:53.680]  see where everybody's making fun of people that go to Walmart they have all
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:58.000]  these pictures of the Walmart people and you read the comments below that they
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:01.280]  all they ought to kill all this trash all this garbage you know they just so
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:06.440]  human well on a lower level that's the same way they look at everybody else's
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:13.920]  society to them the vast majority of population is just a huge population
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:18.440]  on a Walmart but what's even sicker is they then try to dumb down and sabotage
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:24.040]  people to make their claim that were scum tree that's what makes it ten times
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:27.600]  more evil well that's why they destroyed the educational system because they
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:31.640]  you know they've shown it through the polls that the large percentage of the
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:36.400]  graduating seniors from high school have no idea when the Civil War was fought they
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:40.160]  have no idea of Christopher Columbus law I mean it's just things that are just
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:45.040]  unbelievable and you think we spend more on education in a country the entire
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:48.320]  world they spend more to screw them up but we have the government documents so
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:53.760]  uneducated about things that you just essentially have to know we see this is
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:56.520]  another thing hold on Dr. Blotlock we gotta go to break these are hard
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:02.040]  breaks final segment sir come back and get to that point straight ahead by now
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:05.680]  you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:09.920]  transferred from person to person over the internet no bank needed this means
[02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:14.200]  lower fees and accounts can never be frozen limited or closed plus a large

[02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:41.320]  tonight but I want to air it in overdrive coming up and Dr. Blalock you got
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:44.840]  cut off by that break I'm sorry there's satellite breaks for the station so they're
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:48.400]  hard breaks you were saying another thing another important point and we had
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:53.760]  to go to break what was that point sir yeah that's all right well one of the
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:55:01.360]  things that I've noticed I'm 68 years old I've seen a fair bit of history one of
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:05.680]  things I've noticed that has just trained changed drastically in the last 20 30
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:12.880]  years an incredible apathy of people I've never seen anything like it they
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:17.680]  they for instance there's a case in Georgia where children who bought
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:23.480]  Christmas cards that had references to Jesus or the true meaning of Christmas
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:26.960]  they took up their cards to come away from they didn't want any any such
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:32.400]  Christmas cards you know if you think happy holidays or are happy wicking
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:35.960]  which day than that which is a clear violation of the first amendment they
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:40.680]  can personally hand out whatever they want but the point being is that the
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:46.440]  parents didn't really react to one or two parents showed displeasure in another
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:52.520]  case where they were telling the children they need to go on an Islamic tour
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:56.560]  you need to go to this museum and they were getting indoctrinated in Islamic
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.400]  faith and they had to read the Quran and some schools they were having to
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:05.440]  dress in their Islamic dress and so on and so on and yet the parish just
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:09.760]  apathetically accepted the sign the release forms and the permission forms
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:13.520]  them I'm seeing this all over every every kind of program that's just an
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.600]  absolute outrage the outrage by the TSA abuse the outrage by the new
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:23.840]  militarization of the police and and on and on and on and it's just it's always
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:29.240]  met with apathy well you know that's just the way it is well we need to be
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:33.680]  protected against the terror as well we we need to know what people are thinking
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:39.080]  and protected against the shooters and they take their guns they do one thing
[02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:47.000]  after another and always met with apathy now part of that is exhaustion
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:52.880]  because we're inundated from every angle and that's one of the things Pavlov
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:59.120]  taught Stalin that if you take an animal and you exhaust it you can make it do
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:04.240]  almost anything you want it to you can easily retrain it the other thing is
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:09.960]  all these these massive vaccinations fluoride aluminum all these things we
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:16.040]  know that produce apathy in the human brain I think that you know there's a

[03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:23.880]  now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones only at about a minute here in this
[03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:27.800]  segment to be able to go to the special report by John Bowne on the open
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:31.920]  discussion of dictatorship in Congress the fact that Obama is becoming a
[03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:35.760]  dictator if we're not in danger of going into pure authoritarianism we're
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:39.240]  already deep into it but the bottom's falling out Dr. Blalock you were saying
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:43.480]  get back to God that's why the state always attacks God or any belief in
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:48.280]  religion because they want to be God the state is God but you're right we need
[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:53.080]  to get back to God we need to hit our knees to Jesus Christ and ask for God
[03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:59.920]  to soften people's hearts to not want to be collective of slaves well you know
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:04.600]  people need to read their Bible and read it very closely read the the
[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:09.920]  interpretations in Alice's because if you take it word by word and you pay
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:14.520]  attention you'll see everything that's happening today was predicted everything
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:20.920]  that we need to do in response is told so if we read our Bible see the
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:26.760]  sacrifice that was made for us and the the fact that this message from God was
[03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:34.600]  given to us a thousand years ago on how to deal with this that's our answer and
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:39.000]  so people need to return to that they're trying to humiliate us make us look
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:44.080]  like fools who think of these things with the the elevation of science to the
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:48.400]  all-powerful all things have to go through the filter of science well I've
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:53.560]  spent my whole life in science I know a lot of science and I can tell you that
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:59.000]  the truth is God created everything evolution nonsense they know it's
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.960]  nonsense but may readily admit the only reason we adhere to socialism and
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:08.840]  evolution is because without it we would have to believe in God and we don't
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:15.080]  want to but the evidence is on the side of God as the creator it's overwhelming
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:20.720]  doctor it should be it's overwhelming I have studied the elites and none of them
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:25.040]  are atheists at the top they are all into the occult they all believe they're
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:29.800]  going to become God and so they're trying to act like God but the fruits of
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:33.920]  these people is living nightmare I mean it's like if you go to a restaurant and
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:37.720]  the food's terrible you know it's a bad restaurant we know collectivism is
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:43.600]  slavery well you know if you look at the historians who write most about their
[03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:48.760]  origins the politics that originated from nosticism and nosticism is what we
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:53.880]  consider occultism and it's growing like wildfire and as you say all of these
[03:02:53.880 --> 03:02:59.800]  people at the top are nostics they're enemies of Christianity the energy
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:09.040]  enemies of people who believe in God so they're they're occultic and most of them
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:15.200]  were theosophists Jimmy Carter was a theosophist I mean it's amazing Hitler
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:22.000]  was a member of that society you know this is they're created by the Russian
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:28.320]  Blavitsky and I just read one of the great the historical works on it by Oxford
[03:03:28.320 --> 03:03:32.560]  scholar named James Webb and he goes into meticulous history of all the
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:37.280]  people throughout history who belonged and its enormous control this was a
[03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:42.400]  very powerful organization and they believe they're dialing in to spiritual
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:48.000]  entities Lenin was a member of the theosophy and so was Stalin and so was
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:54.320]  Trotsky so was Hitler's henchmen they were all members of the theosophy group
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:59.320]  they were trained by they got many of their programs out of theosophy most
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:05.720]  people don't know that the youth groups came out of theosophy so you know we
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:09.920]  need to wake up pay attention quit telling having other people tell us what
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:16.080]  we need to think and believe and don't respond to the the charges that makes us
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:20.560]  feel humiliated we need to stand up for what we believe that's right exactly
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:25.880]  move forward have a great week coming up dr. Blalock and we will continue to
[03:04:25.880 --> 03:04:28.880]  track what's happening hopefully get you back on a routine basis thank you so

[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:54.040]  people are waking up to the fact that Obama and the executive is becoming an
[03:04:54.040 --> 03:04:57.840]  open dictatorship but at the top the so-called atheists are not atheists
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:03.840]  folks they're worshiping the devil in the last 50 years iodine has been phased
[03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:09.040]  out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now
[03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:13.640]  banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:18.760]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government
[03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:23.840]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:29.160]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:34.160]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:26.040]  radio network
[03:08:26.040 --> 03:08:33.720]  you know I could say that I'm a self-made man but my ancestors with God's
[03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:38.120]  creation built me they built you they built us all and we stand on their
[03:08:38.120 --> 03:08:44.560]  shoulders and I'm not going to let my children down in future generations
[03:08:44.560 --> 03:08:50.000]  we've got to beat this slow march of collectivism that steals our resources
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:54.720]  and puts it into the central controllers so they can try to play God and
[03:08:54.720 --> 03:08:58.680]  talking to playlock because he's so informed it really freaks me out because
[03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:02.360]  I know most of stuff he's talking about I know he's telling the truth and I can
[03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:06.960]  hear the pain in his voice for his children grandchildren and everybody
[03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:12.760]  else I mean this is really bad folks it was judge de Palatano one of his private
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:18.280]  talks you know talked about we should be grieving for America like a wake I mean
[03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:22.560]  this is a big deal but it's all done with slick advertising packaging and the
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:28.640]  rest of it and all I do is seek out ways to tell the truth be the most accurate
[03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:33.600]  be the most honorable and that's why you constantly hear I'm dishonorable I'm
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:37.600]  bad I'm and of course none of us are perfect but I consciously try to be the
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:41.480]  best person I can and it's because that's what the world wants they want me to be
[03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:47.680]  bad like they are they need that they need that to feel good about themselves
[03:09:47.680 --> 03:09:51.520]  when I figure out that people are bad and weak it doesn't make me feel better
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:56.600]  that they're weak that's how the elitists think makes me feel bad that my human
[03:09:56.600 --> 03:10:02.640]  confederates are in so much trouble and so twisted and the betrayals I mean they
[03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:10.880]  are just daily and it is just so amazing society is going crazy and every
[03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:15.880]  manager every person I talk to people in criminal justice people in the medical
[03:10:15.880 --> 03:10:21.800]  field people in teaching and industry they say society is going crazy because
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:26.560]  it's unnatural all the televisions and iPads and the GMO and the chemicals and
[03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:31.600]  the weird messages they're giving people in the subliminals I mean folks are
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:36.440]  screwed up get outside exercise pray even don't believe in God it shows to
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:41.080]  raise your brain waves get you to a higher state of literal physical brain
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:48.160]  waves try to get healthy none of us are perfect try to forgive all the really
[03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:52.840]  screwed up bad people out there and just think of the good that was in them and
[03:10:52.840 --> 03:10:56.920]  try to think of that but with the truly conscious evil see if somebody's kind of
[03:10:56.920 --> 03:11:01.200]  mentally ill and screwed up and attacks me but still does some good work I can
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:06.280]  forgive them and you know try to help them along and I can tell when somebody's
[03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:09.920]  just really breaking down a mentally ill but when you're looking at cold blooded
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:14.440]  scientific evil that literally sees you in a predatory light they've got to be
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:18.040]  dealt with and that goes for the globalist and their whole system and all
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:22.320]  people below them that try to like play into that system and see how the elite
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:26.960]  get ahead so they think they'll get ahead in a tribal way if they do like the
[03:11:26.960 --> 03:11:31.160]  alpha dog the alpha dogs that are in control are in a different set of rules
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:36.440]  where they're exempt from the law at least to a certain level culturally
[03:11:36.440 --> 03:11:40.920]  they're not spiritually they're not they just think they are but for the general
[03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:46.600]  public corruption and fraud is not the way to go now it's not corruption and
[03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:51.180]  fraud if it's unjust taxes and corrupt regulations you've got to decide what
[03:11:51.180 --> 03:11:55.560]  you're gonna do to resist that and more and more I realize it is criminal to
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:12:01.400]  comply with unconstitutional garbage and the social control so I am what you
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:08.000]  could say being radicalized because I'm not radical they're saying an ad about a
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:13.520]  Marine coming home to his family is offensive in pulling up to his house

[03:12:52.880 --> 03:12:56.560]  months while it was being developed you know the test batches and things that
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:13:01.880]  were done and I'm really feeling the difference personally unlike any other
[03:13:01.880 --> 03:13:06.200]  quotes supplements I've ever used there's a lot of great ones out there a lot of
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:09.640]  the great ones are info wars health.com a whole young Jeopardy line but this

[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:49.360]  all the estrogen garbage and the plastics and trying to feminize men and I
[03:13:49.360 --> 03:13:54.640]  just got to be honest with you this this is rocket fuel and I would tell you a
[03:13:54.640 --> 03:14:00.600]  consultant physician and be careful about how you use it I personally only
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:04.760]  take it really a few days a week in a lower dose of it just because I just you
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:10.560]  know I already have a real temper problem obviously but the issue is that
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:15.160]  this is I said we're talking about the whole estrogen thing only goes listen
[03:14:15.160 --> 03:14:20.120]  I'm developing you know the ultimate and you want to put it out and I said
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:24.960]  absolutely so that's Dr. Gribbs super male vitality dietary supplement
[03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:33.200]  available at info wars life.com or by calling 888-253-3139 and both of these
[03:14:33.200 --> 03:14:36.520]  were were the first batches because they literally couldn't get enough of the
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:41.240]  materials at his standard of quality won't use dry herbs and stuff like that
[03:14:41.240 --> 03:14:45.440]  and has to have it all triple certified which is great but it almost becomes you
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:48.440]  know just I mean I guess it's good I guess you're either obsessed with total
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:51.320]  quality or then you don't have total quality but it did because it's very
[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:54.360]  frustrating not even be able to get you enough of this of course that's the
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:57.120]  classic sales pitch we don't have a lot of this watch this will be sold out for
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:00.480]  four to six weeks this stuff will sell out in a couple days at the rate it's
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:03.160]  selling and that's good because it funds our operation we don't have enough of a
[03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:06.720]  sale to fund the operation I don't like having to spend all my time trying to
[03:15:06.720 --> 03:15:09.960]  raise money but I don't get money five hundred million a year whatever it is
[03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:15.160]  like NPR and you know billions to the parent companies MSNBC and stimulus and
[03:15:15.160 --> 03:15:20.640]  bailout money we don't get any of that in fact my moral standards are so high
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:24.440]  that I had a lot of good sponsors and then we have a few still that are you
[03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:26.920]  know good enough to be on but I just can't deal with it anymore I just you
[03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:34.280]  know told the whole sales staff sorry just I'm letting you go and and I'm just
[03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:37.600]  not gonna have sales anymore just gonna I'm gonna sell high quality products and
[03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:41.640]  try to find other sponsors that are good enough I just can't mess with it so

[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:10.120]  they've done here's the article expert testifies the Congress that Obama
[03:16:10.120 --> 03:16:13.800]  ignoring laws could lead to overthrow government but it's not just this one
[03:16:13.800 --> 03:16:17.800]  expert John bound found more of the hearings where they're talking about
[03:16:17.800 --> 03:16:23.120]  all of this and it's not that an overthrow could happen we've had foreign
[03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:28.680]  corporations lobby for COG to be set up shadow government under continuity and
[03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:32.000]  then now they've overthrown the system they have overthrown the central
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:35.160]  government now they're trying to overthrow the states the individual the
[03:16:35.160 --> 03:16:40.160]  family our health our bank accounts to make us dependent and they write books
[03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:46.440]  on agenda 21 the White House science are about the plan it's not like I just
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:50.040]  figured all this out on my own they think you're so dumb they write books
[03:16:50.040 --> 03:16:55.560]  about the criminal activity so here's John bounds a piece and then we'll go
[03:16:55.560 --> 03:16:59.960]  into a rebroadcast but here's the piece on America we've already become a
[03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:04.400]  dictatorship here it is the cogent rhetoric of revolution hung heavy in
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:09.840]  the air in the nation's capital overnight there is one last thing to which
[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:16.160]  the people can resort if the government does not respect the the the restraints
[03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:18.680]  that the Constitution places on the government Abraham Lincoln talked about
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:23.560]  our right to alter our government or a revolutionary right to overthrow it and
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:27.560]  that is certainly something that no one wants to contemplate the House
[03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:30.720]  Judiciary Committee heard from a panel of legal scholars on the
[03:17:30.720 --> 03:17:36.000]  constitutionality and legality of actions taken by the Obama administration
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:40.360]  focusing on the feeble mandates and the Affordable Care Act and the
[03:17:40.360 --> 03:17:43.840]  enforcement of the short-sighted immigration laws we have to repair a
[03:17:43.840 --> 03:17:50.080]  broken immigration system and that this progress is only possible when we do it
[03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:55.240]  together you can if you can dispense with immigration laws or marijuana laws
[03:17:55.240 --> 03:18:03.360]  or mandatory minimums can you also dispense with election laws I again I
[03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:08.320]  think we've we've gone over this ground many times what is human let's do it
[03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:15.720]  one more time can the president suspend election law no why not if he can
[03:18:15.720 --> 03:18:19.680]  suspend mandatory minimum and immigration laws why not election laws as we live
[03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:24.080]  we live in a in a government of laws and the president is bound to obey them
[03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:29.040]  and apply there was a fight with James the first I about what was called the
[03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:33.520]  royal prerogative it's very similar to what president Obama's claiming the
[03:18:33.520 --> 03:18:37.680]  right of the king to essentially stand above the law the growing assertion of
[03:18:37.680 --> 03:18:42.440]  power by this president to do things to change laws that's not his
[03:18:42.440 --> 03:18:46.240]  responsibility that's the Congress is clearly delegated responsibility to
[03:18:46.240 --> 03:18:52.320]  write the laws but even with Obamacare his signature legislation when he finds
[03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:57.080]  things in it that he doesn't like he rewrites the law even though the law
[03:18:57.080 --> 03:19:01.080]  itself doesn't give him any authority to do that George Washington law school
[03:19:01.080 --> 03:19:05.360]  professor Jonathan Turley weighed in on the perishing of the legislative branch
[03:19:05.360 --> 03:19:11.200]  is that it's not only being circumvented but it is also being denied the ability
[03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:16.040]  to enforce its inherent powers many of these questions are not close in my view
[03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:20.240]  the president is outside the line but it has to go in front of a court and that
[03:19:20.240 --> 03:19:23.800]  court has to grant review and that's where we have the most serious
[03:19:23.800 --> 03:19:29.040]  constitutional crisis I view in my lifetime and that is this body is
[03:19:29.040 --> 03:19:34.200]  becoming less and less relevant clearly a criminal administration is holding our
[03:19:34.200 --> 03:19:39.720]  highest seats of power hostage when will the government of the people by the
[03:19:39.720 --> 03:19:45.760]  people for the people wield the hammer of justice rather than simply discuss the
[03:19:45.760 --> 03:19:52.360]  laundry list of tyranny in the nation's capital for the info wars nightly news
[03:19:52.360 --> 03:20:05.440]  John Brown reporting
