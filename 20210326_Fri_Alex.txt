[00:00.000 --> 00:14.720]  With every passing month, every passing week, day, hour, minute, second, the agenda is now
[00:14.720 --> 00:18.720]  completely out of the open and it's exactly what the globalists said they would do 50
[00:18.720 --> 00:23.400]  years ago and they're now going into overdrive. They've hit their afterburners. Thank you
[00:23.400 --> 00:31.360]  for joining us on this March 26, 2021 live Friday edition. I'd like to show the TV viewers
[00:31.360 --> 00:36.680]  the live show Feed Today because I think it boils everything we're dealing with on this
[00:36.680 --> 00:41.000]  planet down and I certainly hope you share that page with others so that they can tune
[00:41.000 --> 00:50.040]  in to this verboten transmission. But just look at the stack here. The EU admits 3964
[00:50.040 --> 00:54.120]  people have died from the vaccines and they haven't updated the numbers in a few weeks
[00:54.120 --> 01:00.920]  so it's going to be much higher. 162,000 plus got injured. Incredible news. We've posted
[01:00.920 --> 01:06.080]  this at infowars.com. Here's another one. Bloomberg, I bet we must start planning for
[01:06.080 --> 01:12.320]  a permanent pandemic, never stop mask, never stop inoculations, never stop being non-essential.
[01:12.320 --> 01:16.640]  And why not? Bloomberg is again almost double his money. They're in the lockdown. It's a
[01:16.640 --> 01:24.760]  lot. Supreme Court judge in the UK says it will last at least 10 years. See, it's all
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.280]  being announced now. I told you over a year ago, it never ends. First it's 15 days, two
[01:29.280 --> 01:32.560]  months, six months a year, two years, three years, five years, 10 years and then it's
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.200]  forever with everything else that comes with it. Hey, Jones, just take your vaccine. Just
[01:38.200 --> 01:43.040]  wear your mask. Let's get this over with in any of you. Get it over with. It's all made
[01:43.040 --> 01:49.560]  up fraud. Learn a term to defeat the enemy. It's called medicalization. I was sitting
[01:49.560 --> 01:53.640]  there talking to a lawyer a couple weeks ago and I said, this is medicalization and they
[01:53.640 --> 02:00.720]  said, is that a made up word? No, it's not a made up word. But we're under. So I typed
[02:00.720 --> 02:06.360]  in medicalization this morning and blew an hour I didn't have at 5 a.m. Reading up on
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.640]  medicalization. You go to the Wikipedia and spend years reading the footnotes in it. I
[02:11.640 --> 02:15.960]  just spent an hour and I pulled up some big mainline studies prestigious about that's
[02:15.960 --> 02:21.400]  what we live under. The tyranny we live under is called medicalization. It is a technocracy
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.800]  that uses medicalization to take full control of society. And here's what's scary. Everybody
[02:27.800 --> 02:32.280]  acts like they're so smart that are professionals, doctors, scientists, lawyers. They don't study
[02:32.280 --> 02:39.520]  any of how it all works. They don't study the founts, the progenitors, the designers.
[02:39.520 --> 02:47.520]  I do. And they tell you they're so arrogant what the plan is. That's why I had so many
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.160]  people including like generals and former heads of intelligence agencies go, Jones, you've
[02:52.160 --> 02:57.120]  obviously got someone advising you of a level. We did a bump even what we know. How do you
[02:57.120 --> 03:01.040]  know all this? How did you predict all this? And I said, I didn't predict a fricking thing
[03:01.040 --> 03:06.040]  basically. I understand how to collate the data. It's out in the open. It's a horrible
[03:06.040 --> 03:13.240]  plan. Satan came up with it. It's definitely anti-human. It's definitely not humans running
[03:13.240 --> 03:20.160]  it. And I don't get into flying saucers, any of that. I can just look at this from a military
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.440]  perspective, a engineering perspective, a societal perspective, a cultural perspective,
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.800]  a religious perspective, a spiritual perspective, a physical perspective and tell you this is
[03:31.800 --> 03:39.000]  the end of us. But before we're all destroyed, we have to give in to evil and submit to the
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.840]  terrain because that's what it really wants is us to resonate with its force so that we
[03:43.840 --> 03:50.760]  are bound to it into the future because we are eternal beings. So we're going to go to
[03:50.760 --> 03:55.640]  break and I'm going to do my best to hit all of this. But I mean, it is just insane. Look
[03:55.640 --> 04:01.440]  how the one Suez Canal breakdown has basically caused a chain reaction that can put us into
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.000]  a world of pressure. What do you think a big war is going to do? People used to be self-sufficient.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.520]  Even in World War II, people were self-sufficient. And hundreds of millions died, mainly from
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.960]  starvation. What do you think is going to happen when they purposely keep making everything
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.400]  break down? And I've got stacks of news on that front that is so criminal. Guess how
[04:19.400 --> 04:29.760]  many people in California, they are housing per leftist home. Just yesterday, I said,
[04:29.760 --> 04:33.720]  I went to foster parent homes when I was a carpet cleaner 30 years ago and they'd have
[04:33.720 --> 04:38.360]  six, seven, eight kids in a tiny house looking like concentration camp victims with a P.B.P.
[04:38.360 --> 04:44.040]  walking around a potbelly pedophile running it. And it's in the news today. They're housing
[04:44.040 --> 04:51.720]  26 little kids per usually potbelly devil or superhouse. I mean, imagine the raping
[04:51.720 --> 05:03.560]  that's going on. Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained
[05:03.560 --> 05:08.520]  to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians
[05:08.520 --> 05:11.840]  and you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training
[05:11.840 --> 05:16.240]  is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because
[05:16.240 --> 05:20.480]  the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And
[05:20.480 --> 05:24.600]  they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the
[05:24.600 --> 05:30.240]  third world that the U.N. will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under
[05:30.240 --> 05:35.160]  such a load, capitulate to the U.N. Whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[05:35.160 --> 05:40.840]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[05:40.840 --> 05:45.440]  change, as the U.N. and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[05:45.440 --> 05:51.440]  year-long lockdowns that the U.N. and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[05:51.440 --> 05:57.240]  get more IMF and World Bank money. And that's why we have to really get educated about the
[05:57.240 --> 05:58.240]  globalists.
[05:58.240 --> 06:22.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from the Infowars.com
[06:22.640 --> 06:40.040]  Studios. It's Alex Jones.
[06:40.040 --> 06:55.540]  We have the
[06:55.540 --> 07:03.100]  That is really hard to say out of your mouth, 3,900 plus dead from the vaccine.
[07:04.260 --> 07:07.380]  But Gates told us 700,000 will get sick or die.
[07:07.820 --> 07:10.100]  He told us 80% would get really sick.
[07:11.020 --> 07:12.140]  And it doesn't even protect us.
[07:12.140 --> 07:14.580]  And now they say, you got to take 10 vaccines a year.
[07:14.580 --> 07:18.060]  It was five vaccines a year and that you still got to wear a mask and you're
[07:18.060 --> 07:19.020]  still not essential.
[07:20.020 --> 07:20.940]  And then it's a great thing.
[07:22.580 --> 07:24.700]  Absolutely incredible.
[07:24.700 --> 07:29.740]  And you can go to the articles, link right to the EU's own website.
[07:29.740 --> 07:31.140]  They're not even hiding it.
[07:31.300 --> 07:34.980]  Let me just read you the headlines right now of the most important news we've
[07:34.980 --> 07:35.620]  got in front of us.
[07:35.620 --> 07:37.900]  I'll tell you about the guest and more that's coming up today and we're going
[07:37.900 --> 07:39.060]  to open the phones up as well.
[07:39.660 --> 07:44.700]  So Friday Live nearly 4,000 have died in Europe after taking the vaccine,
[07:44.700 --> 07:45.500]  according to the EU.
[07:45.780 --> 07:46.300]  Wow.
[07:46.300 --> 07:53.580]  The role of COVID lockdowns in 2020 homicides surge, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:55.580 --> 07:59.100]  We already knew that, but this is meant to break down society.
[07:59.100 --> 08:05.300]  Qantas boss, governments to insist on vaccines for flying, BBC, Royal Caribbean
[08:05.300 --> 08:09.700]  only accepts vaccinated passengers on next Caribbean cruise, zero hedge.
[08:10.060 --> 08:13.100]  Whole countries are saying you can't period come unless you have it, even
[08:13.100 --> 08:15.700]  though a lot of people have doctors on record saying you can't take a vaccine.
[08:15.700 --> 08:20.700]  You have anaphylactic shock, you have autoimmune disorders, you have everything.
[08:22.300 --> 08:25.100]  You've got all the propaganda, all the garbage.
[08:25.300 --> 08:28.900]  Now there's a thing called Moderna arm where you get really, really sick in
[08:28.900 --> 08:31.100]  your arm almost basically falls off.
[08:31.100 --> 08:34.300]  But look at this really big news right here.
[08:36.700 --> 08:37.900]  Bloomberg op-ed.
[08:37.900 --> 08:41.100]  We must start planning for a pandemic that's permanent.
[08:41.100 --> 08:43.500]  The lockdowns never end.
[08:43.500 --> 08:44.500]  You are non-essential.
[08:44.500 --> 08:48.500]  Your small restaurant never opens, but all the big restaurants are allowed to open.
[08:49.500 --> 08:52.100]  All the big box stores and we put up with our own destruction.
[08:53.100 --> 08:57.700]  Supreme Court judge expects people will be forced to wear masks, stay at home
[08:57.700 --> 09:01.700]  for 10 years and that is the Supreme Court judge Lord Summerton will play a
[09:01.700 --> 09:02.700]  clip of him in a moment.
[09:02.700 --> 09:04.100]  But why is this important?
[09:04.700 --> 09:08.500]  Because everything you see in Australia, everything you see in Canada and everything
[09:08.500 --> 09:12.100]  you see in Europe, everything you see in the UK is because they have total
[09:12.100 --> 09:15.900]  election fraud over there and the people can't get out from under the tyranny.
[09:15.900 --> 09:19.500]  And so you're seeing actually what the in-game plan is or the next phase.
[09:21.700 --> 09:28.500]  But you don't see that in Texas or South Dakota or Florida or other areas
[09:28.500 --> 09:31.100]  because they know they've done psychological tests.
[09:31.100 --> 09:35.900]  They've done studies at Yale and other places before this knowing what region
[09:35.900 --> 09:40.900]  we'll put up with what we've been all studied very, very closely by this evil
[09:40.900 --> 09:45.900]  anti-human force that looks at us like we're little creatures in a Petri dish
[09:45.900 --> 09:47.900]  and that are just in its way.
[09:48.900 --> 09:52.900]  And so here we're given the first phases and then they tighten it down and
[09:52.900 --> 09:55.900]  then they know that that'll build political resistance with the people
[09:55.900 --> 09:57.500]  with the legislatures with the courts.
[09:57.500 --> 09:59.900]  So they reduce it by 80%.
[10:00.900 --> 10:02.900]  Then any political resistance fades away.
[10:02.900 --> 10:05.900]  Six months later, a year later, they clamp it back down.
[10:05.900 --> 10:08.900]  When major resistance forms, they release it 60%.
[10:09.900 --> 10:11.900]  Then they clamp down again.
[10:11.900 --> 10:13.900]  Next time they release it, 40%.
[10:13.900 --> 10:15.900]  Then they clamp down again.
[10:15.900 --> 10:17.900]  Next time they release it, 10%.
[10:18.900 --> 10:21.900]  But because you feel like you're getting out of it each time,
[10:21.900 --> 10:24.900]  because you're only living in the day, the week, the year,
[10:25.900 --> 10:28.900]  you have a short attention span, I do as well.
[10:28.900 --> 10:32.900]  Well, then once they take the restrictions partially off, you accept
[10:32.900 --> 10:34.900]  the straight jacket that's on.
[10:34.900 --> 10:37.900]  You accept the handcuffs because they've loosened them up a bit.
[10:38.900 --> 10:40.900]  And so this is all psychological warfare.
[10:40.900 --> 10:42.900]  As long as you realize you're being taken over,
[10:42.900 --> 10:45.900]  as long as you realize it's a globalist program, as long as you realize it's a trap
[10:45.900 --> 10:49.900]  and only gets worse when you submit, then you start not complying.
[10:49.900 --> 10:50.900]  You start resisting.
[10:50.900 --> 10:51.900]  You start educating others.
[10:51.900 --> 10:55.900]  You start saying no, but they've got it so isolated and so atomized
[10:55.900 --> 10:58.900]  and so selfish on average that people think it's weird.
[11:00.900 --> 11:04.900]  Especially in New York or the big cities in California or places like that,
[11:05.900 --> 11:09.900]  when you actually warn people and say, hey, did you know the vaccine doesn't protect you?
[11:09.900 --> 11:10.900]  Oh, shut up.
[11:10.900 --> 11:11.900]  I just want to be able to get back to normal.
[11:11.900 --> 11:13.900]  Well, actually, I'm not going to let you get back to normal.
[11:13.900 --> 11:14.900]  Oh, shut up.
[11:14.900 --> 11:15.900]  Hold them that six months ago.
[11:15.900 --> 11:16.900]  Hold them that a year ago.
[11:16.900 --> 11:17.900]  Now it's all admitted.
[11:17.900 --> 11:21.900]  The same people go, I don't want to hear it because they don't want to hear they got conned.
[11:21.900 --> 11:24.900]  There's an old saying, you can't con an honest man,
[11:25.900 --> 11:30.900]  but you can con people that are lazy and self-centered and demonic.
[11:31.900 --> 11:33.900]  And so they like wearing masks.
[11:33.900 --> 11:35.900]  They like feeling they're good and you're not.
[11:35.900 --> 11:37.900]  They like the fraud of it.
[11:37.900 --> 11:38.900]  They like to dress up of it.
[11:39.900 --> 11:42.900]  They are spiritually unconscious at the bare minimum.
[11:42.900 --> 11:47.900]  And then you go down the ladder from there into hell itself and total psychotic.
[11:47.900 --> 11:52.900]  It was a big Fox news article.
[11:52.900 --> 11:53.900]  I'm at the center of the crew.
[11:53.900 --> 11:56.900]  I forgot on the front page of Fox that John Wayne Gacy, you know,
[11:56.900 --> 12:01.900]  like to dress up like a clown and tortured at least 35 young men and boys to death, raping them.
[12:03.900 --> 12:14.900]  He told the police officers that have now spoken out the first time in the documentary that he enjoyed the power of having them beg for their lives while he raped them over several days and tortured them.
[12:14.900 --> 12:16.900]  And he felt like he was sucking their essence out.
[12:16.900 --> 12:18.900]  Yeah, like it, the clown.
[12:18.900 --> 12:20.900]  That's who these people are.
[12:20.900 --> 12:25.900]  And all of this is about oppressing you and hurting you and doing bad things.
[12:25.900 --> 12:29.900]  And because you're not like those people, you think, oh, no one's doing this.
[12:29.900 --> 12:37.900]  There's not really all these bad people out there because you are projecting your own lack of desire to commit evil onto other people.
[12:37.900 --> 12:38.900]  And that's very, very foolish.
[12:38.900 --> 12:41.900]  Oh, you're fear mongering, but I'm not.
[12:41.900 --> 12:49.900]  And I was reading this morning that article about John Wayne Gacy, how he enjoyed the power of death was the headline.
[12:49.900 --> 12:51.900]  Just go to foxnews.com.
[12:51.900 --> 12:54.900]  It's typing John Wayne Gacy, your power of death or just death.
[12:54.900 --> 12:56.900]  It'll come up for you.
[12:56.900 --> 12:58.900]  No one to read that later.
[12:58.900 --> 13:10.900]  And then maybe put Bill Gates to the videos because when they describe the power he wanted, the control, the luring, the people, the setting him up, that's what this whole medicalization medical tyranny globalist program is.
[13:10.900 --> 13:12.900]  And I'm going to cover that as well.
[13:12.900 --> 13:15.900]  So there's that stack of news information.
[13:15.900 --> 13:20.900]  Then there's something that gets me even madder because it's just so out in the open and so outrageous.
[13:20.900 --> 13:23.900]  And I'll cover it next segment.
[13:23.900 --> 13:36.900]  And that's the massive human smuggling and trafficking of children into Democrat arms where Democrat families that are signed up with these refugee center community groups and the Muslims have it.
[13:36.900 --> 13:41.900]  All the big Christian churches have it. A lot of the big Jewish synagogues are heavily involved.
[13:41.900 --> 13:49.900]  And they have families that and the churches take in up to 26 children a piece and then they the churches get taxpayer money for this.
[13:49.900 --> 13:56.900]  Then they launder the money, the synagogues, the churches, the mosque, the Catholic church is big as well.
[13:56.900 --> 14:00.900]  They launder that money back in the Democratic Party.
[14:00.900 --> 14:09.900]  And that's our project Veritas, you know, nine years ago could just walk right into multiple Democrat facilities and say, I've got kidnapped girls for sex slavery.
[14:09.900 --> 14:11.900]  And they're like, fantastic, let's put up to work right now.
[14:11.900 --> 14:14.900]  We're ready to help you out, get you a place, run those whores.
[14:14.900 --> 14:18.900]  Just make sure you pay your local taxes or they'll shut us down.
[14:18.900 --> 14:22.900]  And he's dressed up in a pimp outfit with a girl he says is, you know, 13 or 14.
[14:22.900 --> 14:25.900]  They're like, get that whore to work.
[14:25.900 --> 14:26.900]  That's who they are.
[14:26.900 --> 14:28.900]  And they mean business.
[14:28.900 --> 14:31.900]  They are an organized crime wall.
[14:31.900 --> 14:35.900]  And of course they're taking down the Internet and taking our systems and censoring us.
[14:35.900 --> 14:40.900]  And the New York Times has called now for actually censoring URLs.
[14:40.900 --> 14:41.900]  I told you that was coming.
[14:41.900 --> 14:44.900]  Now they're going to block it at the IP level.
[14:44.900 --> 14:46.900]  That's coming up.
[14:46.900 --> 14:48.900]  They say Jones is a Nazi.
[14:48.900 --> 14:51.900]  The only thing I see like Nazis is the left.
[14:51.900 --> 15:02.900]  I remember one of the Legals, California allows foster parents to house up to 26 unaccompanied minors as young as one year old just kidnap drug across the border and hand it over to these random homes.
[15:02.900 --> 15:07.900]  And they just disappear to that hellhole.
[15:07.900 --> 15:09.900]  Big business.
[15:09.900 --> 15:13.900]  And I'm not saying all foster parents are bad, but for most of them it's a business.
[15:13.900 --> 15:16.900]  And, you know, you thought old fashioned orphanages were bad.
[15:16.900 --> 15:20.900]  I mean, we're talking, we're talking kids sleeping 8, 9, 10 to a room.
[15:20.900 --> 15:24.900]  And we're talking getting a couple hot dogs a day, maybe some cereal if they're lucky.
[15:24.900 --> 15:26.900]  And I told you about this this week.
[15:26.900 --> 15:31.900]  And I told you when I was a carpet cleaner for a summer that I couldn't do it anymore because I was like, what is this?
[15:31.900 --> 15:32.900]  It was a foster house.
[15:32.900 --> 15:38.900]  It was like all these dirty mattresses and babies and there's like one fat pedophile looking gated.
[15:38.900 --> 15:40.900]  And I mean, it's just like, what the hell's going on here?
[15:40.900 --> 15:43.900]  And then we all know it's just the harvest thing of our children.
[15:43.900 --> 15:50.900]  All right, anyways, well, then they get a lot of that fresh meat out of Latin America and a lot of them end up dead satanic rituals.
[15:50.900 --> 15:56.900]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[15:56.900 --> 15:59.900]  My enemies are your enemies.
[15:59.900 --> 16:01.900]  They're the globalistic and extremist.
[16:01.900 --> 16:09.900]  They are a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, wherever you want to call them,
[16:09.900 --> 16:20.900]  that are highly predatory and are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic radiation
[16:20.900 --> 16:30.900]  to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[16:30.900 --> 16:32.900]  The bottom line is they want to play God.
[16:32.900 --> 16:33.900]  They are playing God.
[16:33.900 --> 16:37.900]  And the news is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[16:37.900 --> 16:39.900]  So many other people want to be positive.
[16:39.900 --> 16:44.900]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order.
[16:44.900 --> 16:47.900]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[16:47.900 --> 16:48.900]  It's all about world government.
[16:48.900 --> 16:51.900]  It's all about the end of human system as we know it.
[16:51.900 --> 16:55.900]  And on its ashes, a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[16:55.900 --> 16:59.900]  Alex Jones here with the new info or sale, and it is a fantastic sale.
[16:59.900 --> 17:03.900]  It is many of our best selling products that just so happened to also be selling out.

[17:40.900 --> 17:43.900]  The entire Emirates Essentials line is close to selling out.

[17:55.900 --> 18:02.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:02.900 --> 18:04.900]  You
[18:25.900 --> 18:26.900]  Welcome back.
[18:26.900 --> 18:27.900]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[18:27.900 --> 18:28.900]  Here's what everybody needs to know.
[18:28.900 --> 18:29.900]  And I know you know this.
[18:29.900 --> 18:32.420]  We need to have this up front in our minds.
[18:32.420 --> 18:34.500]  The left does not have the moral authority.
[18:34.500 --> 18:39.920]  They are the most evil, selfish, manipulating, conniving, lying people on earth that use
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.820]  psychiatry and psychology to control us and manipulate us.
[18:43.820 --> 18:48.660]  It is all on record, even mainstream news, that for decades they've been studying how
[18:48.660 --> 18:54.060]  to use fear of a pandemic to bring in an authoritarian society and it's an operation lockstep and
[18:54.060 --> 19:00.020]  it's an event 201 and it's in crimson contagion and it's all there.
[19:00.020 --> 19:05.500]  And now Schwab and all of them admit that they're doing this on purpose, it's permanent
[19:05.500 --> 19:09.340]  and that they've taken over and isn't it good we're saving the earth by starving the third
[19:09.340 --> 19:13.700]  world to death and then flooding us with the third world who they then exploit at massive
[19:13.700 --> 19:19.020]  levels.
[19:19.020 --> 19:24.020]  The globalists set up the third world to exploit people and the UN's biggest business
[19:24.020 --> 19:29.740]  is sex traffic, look it up, they're famous for it, industrial level, millions of women
[19:29.740 --> 19:38.180]  and children a year and these demons that inhabit these humanoids or whatever they are
[19:38.180 --> 19:44.100]  literally are killing women and children on a mass scale and they put them in acid baths
[19:44.100 --> 19:49.900]  ladies and gentlemen after they're done raping them and torturing them.
[19:49.900 --> 19:54.660]  And you see John Wayne Gasey and people, they're nothing, they're just private operators of
[19:54.660 --> 19:59.980]  this cult.
[19:59.980 --> 20:05.700]  If you don't know about the UN, it's a giant sex slave trade, just type in UN sex slavery,
[20:05.700 --> 20:08.860]  UN child kidnapping.
[20:08.860 --> 20:13.580]  It's unbelievable, they've done it in over a hundred nations tortured and kidnapped
[20:13.580 --> 20:17.660]  children and of course the Clintons are heavily involved in their foundation and their foundation
[20:17.660 --> 20:22.540]  had was caught smuggling children out of Haiti that disappeared.
[20:22.540 --> 20:26.620]  You know they say we're gonna have kids five and six waiting for you in the hot tub, they're
[20:26.620 --> 20:32.460]  ready to service you but they are kids so they may not follow every order, that's in
[20:32.460 --> 20:37.100]  the WikiLeaks, that's real.
[20:37.100 --> 20:44.660]  And why do they like the open borders because it's children, they can disappear in mass.
[20:44.660 --> 20:53.660]  So roll some of that footage just for TV viewers that Drew Hernandez got, that was just when
[20:53.660 --> 20:54.660]  he was there.
[20:54.660 --> 20:58.020]  And it's like a dozen people come across with a bunch of little kids like two, three-year-old
[20:58.020 --> 21:03.180]  toddlers, little girls like she's about three and she's just toddling over into the US border
[21:03.180 --> 21:10.300]  and it just disappears into some rat hole nest, might go to a nice family, probably won't,
[21:10.300 --> 21:15.700]  definitely will be neglected and then Biden yesterday, they're trying to find a clip because
[21:15.700 --> 21:19.380]  I saw it when Owen was re-earing the press conference yesterday afternoon and I meant
[21:19.380 --> 21:22.580]  to go tell a crew member but it's somewhere in there and they bring up human smuggling
[21:22.580 --> 21:26.780]  and trafficking and Biden like looks down at snarls when they say human trafficking
[21:26.780 --> 21:34.020]  and smiles with a demonic smile and man you really see his demon face there.
[21:34.020 --> 21:39.180]  He gets very excited like Governor Newsom and others when they talk about sex trafficking
[21:39.180 --> 21:43.700]  and children and lockdowns and I mean these are just evil people.
[21:43.700 --> 21:49.580]  Look at Brian Stelter, they're dancing on our graves and fresh meat is just pouring
[21:49.580 --> 22:00.460]  across many of them kidnapped children and Socky says bring kids, we'll let you in.
[22:00.460 --> 22:04.220]  So here it is, overrun with illegals in the Daily Mills reporting on this, California
[22:04.220 --> 22:11.100]  Yellow House foster parents, 26 unaccompanied minors per home, good social workers, good
[22:11.100 --> 22:14.780]  families, I'm not saying they're all bad, it's just that it's a corrupt industry, it's
[22:14.780 --> 22:19.580]  protected, it's overrun with sexual abuse, it's where the predators go, just like so
[22:19.580 --> 22:23.180]  many family court judges, so many judges get caught running pedophile rings just last
[22:23.180 --> 22:29.700]  week, two of them got busted, all Democrats, LBGT leaders and it's because they're ring
[22:29.700 --> 22:35.380]  leaders just like Sandusky and so they've collapsed the third world, oh and I love
[22:35.380 --> 22:42.860]  Biden yesterday, he goes Trump, this is the next clip I want, he said Trump is killing
[22:42.860 --> 22:48.020]  people and making them starve to death over the border, it was the lockdown that more
[22:48.020 --> 22:51.460]  than tripled the amount of starvation, that's not even debated.
[22:51.460 --> 22:55.620]  So the globalists do this, Trump tries to stop it partially, he's certainly not perfect
[22:55.620 --> 23:03.780]  and then now it's his fault, lie upon lie upon lie, so here's part of the voicemail,
[23:03.780 --> 23:07.140]  you can see the whole thing if you want, listen to the whole thing and infowars.com,
[23:07.860 --> 23:11.460]  with them saying we need up to 26 children per house, here it is.
[23:12.660 --> 23:17.380]  This is an emergency message, please respond to this urgent message from the Community Care
[23:17.380 --> 23:22.500]  Licensing Division, CCLD would like to know how many available beds you have to serve
[23:22.500 --> 23:25.860]  additional use, to confirm your receipt of this message, please call.
[23:27.220 --> 23:34.900]  And on the side it says up to 26 children, full reports at infowars.com, you need to share
[23:34.900 --> 23:39.140]  an investigative journal's reports on southern border, dims and powering human traffickers,
[23:39.700 --> 23:44.660]  that's because they are human traffickers, just type in the senate report, even the Washington
[23:44.660 --> 23:51.780]  Post, Obama knowingly placed small children including babies with known human traffickers
[23:51.780 --> 24:03.860]  and sex offenders by the tens of thousands, truly incredible. And this is Biden with a cheat sheet
[24:03.860 --> 24:09.380]  with the photos of the reporters, their names, who to go to, who to not go to and then how to
[24:09.380 --> 24:17.220]  respond to each thing and he still could barely even talk. Let's play though a few minutes here
[24:17.220 --> 24:24.020]  of a report from a few years ago of a woman saying, I got 17 kids, you've got to take care of them.
[24:24.020 --> 24:28.900]  So we have this welfare system that gets a woman to have 17 kids and then she wants everybody to
[24:28.900 --> 24:33.700]  pay for it, she's so entitled. And then now you've got the whole world saying, hey, we're just dropping
[24:33.700 --> 24:40.580]  our kids off in America, they do the same crap in Europe, they call children 25, 30 year old Muslim men
[24:41.140 --> 24:45.620]  and then they put them in schools with middle school and high school girls and tell the girls
[24:45.620 --> 24:51.940]  to have sex with them in PSA videos. I've played them. This is the raping of the West folks. This
[24:51.940 --> 24:56.980]  is just diabolical satanic vandalism. You say, why would a satanist want to have a two-year-old girl
[24:56.980 --> 25:02.420]  and just pull her eyeballs out with pliers and rip her teeth out and put cigarettes out on her
[25:02.420 --> 25:06.020]  and gang rape her till her guts are hanging out. I'm sorry, that's what they like to do
[25:06.580 --> 25:11.380]  because it's about their selfishness and then the evil they're into and there's no bottom to it.
[25:11.380 --> 25:15.220]  Well, they're doing it to America and the world and our churches. They burned down the Notre
[25:15.220 --> 25:20.100]  Dan Cathedral. They want to kill everybody. You got ISIS running around, eating hearts and all
[25:20.100 --> 25:25.300]  this crap. This is what happens when God leaves, when we kick God out. All hell breaks loose in
[25:25.300 --> 25:30.500]  every damn case in history. We're going to go to break. I'm going to play this newscast with a woman
[25:30.500 --> 25:34.100]  saying, I got 17 kids, take care of it. Everybody laughed at her and said it was horrible. Well,
[25:34.100 --> 25:38.740]  what does the UN say? They collapsed the third world. Bring everybody up here. We're going to
[25:38.740 --> 25:42.500]  pay for it. They're going to organize them into a kept group. They control, they're going to exploit
[25:42.500 --> 25:46.820]  them. They're going to skim money off the top and put them all in welfare. That's how the scam works.
[25:48.100 --> 25:53.220]  Separately, there is only five days left in this. It will end next Wednesday. That is Thursday
[25:53.220 --> 25:57.620]  morning. The free shipping on the mega blowout sale has to end because so much of this stuff at

[29:56.740 --> 30:01.860]  Brainforce Plus, by the way, one of my all time favorite products. I completely owe my ability
[30:01.860 --> 30:07.140]  to do this job. I owe my ability to have graduated college four or five years ago. I owe it completely
[30:07.140 --> 30:11.700]  to Brainforce Plus, one of the most powerful nutraceuticals you will find. I put it right up
[30:11.700 --> 30:16.180]  there with Turboforce. I love Turboforce. It's great, but when you don't have time or you don't
[30:16.180 --> 30:22.500]  have the wherewithal to drink a bottle of water, take two capsules of Brainforce Plus and you will
[30:22.500 --> 30:27.860]  launch into the stratosphere. You will go to the moon. You will not know where all your energy came
[30:27.860 --> 30:32.580]  from and then you'll remember, but there's no crash. That's the important part about Brainforce Plus
[30:32.580 --> 30:37.540]  is there's no crash. It's not like drinking three cups of coffee to get that same amount of buzz
[30:37.540 --> 30:41.700]  because you don't come crashing down. You also, you don't get the jitters. At least I don't. You
[30:41.700 --> 30:46.580]  don't get the anxiety. You don't get all of the things that usually come with drinking coffee or
[30:46.580 --> 30:53.540]  energy drinks. Brainforce Plus, clean, natural energy. And right now, it's on sale 50% off info
[30:53.540 --> 31:09.460]  wordstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:23.620 --> 31:30.740]  So you'll remember in the old days, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, Nike was bad because they had sweat
[31:30.740 --> 31:36.900]  shops in places like Indonesia where people work 12 hours a day for very low wages.
[31:38.180 --> 31:42.420]  And that's not a good thing. People should be aware of that, but they weren't slaves.
[31:44.100 --> 31:51.140]  Well, now Nike has been critical and said, you know, we really shouldn't buy components
[31:51.140 --> 31:56.740]  for major world companies that are from Uyghurs and Buddhists and Christians and giant slavecans
[31:56.740 --> 32:01.220]  that the State Department, everybody admits are operating. The footage has come out.
[32:01.220 --> 32:05.220]  There's been the Australian government's document that the Chinese don't even really deny it.
[32:06.660 --> 32:11.700]  And so that's blown up as a big story because China is boycotting
[32:11.700 --> 32:21.700]  Nike, H&M, Burberry and others for a backlash and boycotts in China overstance on weaker treatment.
[32:23.220 --> 32:28.820]  So again, if we don't value other people's lives, no one's going to value ours. If we don't value
[32:28.820 --> 32:33.700]  unborn babies lives, no one's going to value our lives. If we don't value already born babies lives,
[32:33.700 --> 32:39.700]  no one's going to care about ours. And if we don't care that they're exploiting and collapsing and
[32:39.700 --> 32:43.140]  starving hundreds of millions of people are now in the verge of starvation that you would
[32:43.140 --> 32:47.300]  admit that. But they're the ones that ran the global lockdown. They're the ones that said,
[32:47.300 --> 32:52.820]  do it, and it's still locked down in most of the world. And the shutting down of our economy,
[32:52.820 --> 32:57.140]  when you've got one crop economies in places in Africa where the whole country operates off of
[32:57.140 --> 33:01.540]  flowers shipped to the United States and Europe, there's four or five African countries that their
[33:01.540 --> 33:07.620]  main crop is just flowers that are put on airplanes and carbon dioxide packages and shipped up here
[33:07.620 --> 33:12.980]  to your grocery stores and to your florist. Hey, if you were a florist here and lost your job,
[33:12.980 --> 33:19.060]  you just have to get another job. You lose your job at a flower farm in Africa. You go home,
[33:19.060 --> 33:24.500]  you don't get food, you shrivel up, you die of malnutrition. And the people just go home and
[33:24.500 --> 33:28.180]  they die and their kids starve to death. And the left's like, well, there are too many people,
[33:28.180 --> 33:32.500]  exactly. From their perspective, they're just getting rid of the unwashed masses. So don't
[33:32.500 --> 33:36.180]  believe them when they tell you they want you to take a vaccine or they want to do all these
[33:36.180 --> 33:42.260]  things that they care about you. Remember? LeBron James says, oh my gosh, America's a racist
[33:42.260 --> 33:47.060]  country. Colin Kaepernick, it's evil, it's bad, it's terrible. We need reparations for slavery
[33:47.060 --> 33:55.460]  170 years ago. But when people said, hey, what about China and its slave camps? And what about
[33:55.460 --> 34:00.420]  how they're censoring the NBA? He said, everybody's a shut up and not criticize China. And all those
[34:00.420 --> 34:11.540]  other NBA individuals came out and joined in kissing the communist dictatorships. But so
[34:12.660 --> 34:19.060]  I hammer this a lot. But if we let them kill the third world and then use who's left to overthrow
[34:19.060 --> 34:27.220]  us, we're idiots. And it's a very, very simple equation. Everyone is being exploited. We need
[34:27.220 --> 34:32.020]  to build up the third world and build ourselves up, not lower ourselves to a third world level
[34:32.020 --> 34:35.780]  because the globalists told us that was a moral thing to do while they all live and have hundreds
[34:35.780 --> 34:41.220]  of billions of dollars in their bank accounts and in giant palatial mansions and helicopters and jets
[34:41.220 --> 34:45.300]  and medicine and all that's great. Everybody could end up having that in the future. Watch
[34:45.300 --> 34:48.900]  with unlimited energy, all the things we have, except they don't want you to have it. And that's
[34:48.900 --> 34:58.900]  what feudal lords always do. They don't want you to have a car or to have a decent house or go on
[34:58.900 --> 35:02.980]  vacation. They say that that's all going. They don't want you to be able to eat meat. But Bill
[35:02.980 --> 35:07.300]  Gates is going to be the biggest owner of farmland. You shouldn't be able to own a farm. But Bill Gates
[35:07.300 --> 35:13.540]  is the biggest owner of farmland. This is the soulness of this. So the woke crowd of LeBron James
[35:13.540 --> 35:19.380]  worth $500 million can bitch about how much America sucks to make himself feel good about
[35:19.380 --> 35:24.020]  being such a superstar in a communist super state that's killed five times what Adolf Hitler did.
[35:25.220 --> 35:29.940]  And that's all Apple and Google and Facebook and any of them do, is they tell you how bad you are
[35:29.940 --> 35:36.660]  all day and they ban Dumbo and they put all these restrictions out there and tell you that language
[35:36.660 --> 35:41.780]  is evil. So we all turn against each other while they run away with a breakaway civilization
[35:41.780 --> 35:45.460]  and all stolen technology, everything else for themselves. And now they're doing medical
[35:45.460 --> 35:50.660]  experimentation on us and there's mass deaths and illnesses from it and they censor people
[35:50.660 --> 35:59.140]  that try to warn the world, including medical doctors. And now we've got hundreds of thousands.
[35:59.140 --> 36:05.620]  It's hundreds of thousands. It's 168,000 people were apprehended by the Border Patrol in the last
[36:05.620 --> 36:10.500]  three weeks. The numbers were put out last night. It's estimated that maybe a third of the people
[36:10.500 --> 36:14.980]  coming across even get apprehended. But let's just say it's conservative. Let's just say it's
[36:14.980 --> 36:23.540]  only another 50,000. So it's 215,000 or something. Coming in every three weeks, a lot of them children
[36:24.420 --> 36:30.340]  and it's been to clowered and piven, collapsed the civilization. And then meanwhile, the welfare
[36:30.340 --> 36:36.420]  system says you can't have men in the house back in the 60s. So black illegitimacy goes from 10%
[36:36.420 --> 36:41.300]  to 80%, roughly 79%. And the same thing's happened to every other community right now.
[36:41.860 --> 36:47.220]  Civilizations being destroyed and you've got women at home, paid welfare, the more children they have
[36:47.220 --> 36:50.980]  that then go into the state. They get malnourished. They never get educated. They sit in front of
[36:50.980 --> 36:56.180]  TVs all day and hear that white people are Satan. So then they go out and they arm rob some old white
[36:56.180 --> 36:59.700]  lady and get sent to 20 years to the penitentiary. And when they come out of the penitentiary act
[36:59.700 --> 37:04.260]  for 20 years, they've got a 20 year degree in criminal activity. This is how you take down
[37:04.260 --> 37:09.380]  society. So here's part of the newscast of the woman saying, take my kids. And now the whole
[37:09.380 --> 37:15.220]  world says take my kids, including kidnappers, grab kids as a football, a ticket to get into
[37:15.220 --> 37:19.620]  country because Biden told him Biden said immediately rush and bring a kid with you.
[37:19.620 --> 37:24.100]  Those are quotes immediately rushed. And then his secretary said, bring someone 10 or younger.
[37:24.820 --> 37:32.820]  We like them young. Here it is. I don't have any clothes. People been donating food just around
[37:32.820 --> 37:38.580]  here, just helping me out with food. And I don't have anything. Somebody needs to pay.
[37:49.140 --> 37:53.060]  Now that's just one newscast. Pull up the other one. They did a couple of years later with the
[37:53.060 --> 37:58.660]  same lady. She's got 17 kids and she's literally on the news after everybody makes fun of her.
[37:58.660 --> 38:04.260]  And she's saying, hey, somebody needs to, because I mean, wherever all these paychecks you get for
[38:04.260 --> 38:09.300]  having kids and welfare, I see a lot of these people are so dumbed down, a lot of them aren't
[38:09.300 --> 38:13.540]  even getting the money. But you'll then find out that there's some bureaucrat that for years is
[38:13.540 --> 38:17.700]  getting the money from these women, these families. And that's what they do with the Hispanics they
[38:17.700 --> 38:21.460]  bring in particularly. They have a local Hispanic mafia that controls them organized crime usually
[38:21.460 --> 38:26.260]  run by the Mexican mayor. They'll have a dungeon for people that don't pay up. They'll go chop people
[38:26.260 --> 38:30.500]  up and kill them in the dungeon. That's come out in Austin. And they've got enforcers that control
[38:30.500 --> 38:33.700]  they just bring in these people, they sign up, they're going to work here. You're going to give
[38:33.700 --> 38:36.740]  us half your paycheck. And we're going to sign you up for welfare as well. You're going to give
[38:36.740 --> 38:41.300]  us half of that as well. And if you don't do it, we say we're going to kill you. How's that sound?
[38:41.300 --> 38:45.860]  Oh, and by the way, you owe the cartel $5,000, $10,000, $20,000 for getting your family up here.
[38:45.860 --> 38:52.580]  We're going to pay that money to them. And if you don't do we say we're going to selectively
[38:52.580 --> 38:58.260]  call and have your ass deported. How's that sound? And that's how the loving liberals operate. Oh,
[38:58.260 --> 39:02.500]  they care about everyone. And that's why the due process is gone. And why we're all in so much
[39:02.500 --> 39:09.380]  danger. Because the globalists are taking over and they are teaching us to not take care of
[39:09.380 --> 39:14.900]  ourselves, not have instincts and not be territorial and not stand up for ourselves. And so everything
[39:14.900 --> 39:21.300]  is now imploding. And it's only going to get worse from here on out. And the Democrats and the
[39:21.300 --> 39:25.140]  globalists, these multinational corporations run the same scam, whether they're in Germany
[39:25.700 --> 39:30.100]  or whether they are in the United States or whether they are in the UK. And in the UK,
[39:30.100 --> 39:34.500]  they then kidnap the indigenous young girls by the tens of thousands, sometimes thousands for
[39:34.500 --> 39:39.620]  town and literally keep them from ages six, seven, eight, nine up as sex slaves. And if the girl gets
[39:39.620 --> 39:44.740]  up and he tries to escape, they chop them up. And the favorite thing is to feed them to the locals
[39:44.740 --> 39:50.260]  in the kebab machines, because the Pakistani men and others run these kebab stands. And it comes
[39:50.260 --> 39:54.580]  out in the news that they feed the meat, it's a good way to get rid of people, to you in the kebab
[39:54.580 --> 39:59.780]  stands. And the police won't do anything because the British government, the British police are
[39:59.780 --> 40:04.740]  there to destroy the indigenous population and bring in the most vicious, dumbed down, horrible,
[40:04.740 --> 40:11.460]  white slavery trafficking scum the earth has ever seen. So the chivalry is gone, the decency is
[40:11.460 --> 40:17.140]  gone, the real protections are gone, and the FBI and the ATF and the whole government's there to
[40:17.140 --> 40:21.780]  for the controlled takedown of America. And these people are so evil and so stupid, they don't even
[40:21.780 --> 40:26.100]  care. They won't have a retirement. They won't have a future. Their children won't be safe. They
[40:26.100 --> 40:30.820]  don't care because people are mesmerized living in the moment. And American men have learned to be
[40:30.820 --> 40:35.140]  cowards and bow down to the system and do what they're told just like the men in Europe and
[40:35.140 --> 40:39.700]  everywhere else. And so you're going to have the new dark ages and the accelerated collapse of society
[40:39.700 --> 40:44.180]  with a breakaway civilization, with the life extension, everything else in armored fortress
[40:44.180 --> 40:49.060]  city states and everywhere else will be like the Hunger Games, a total nightmare that was actually
[40:49.060 --> 40:53.620]  based on 21. Her book is based on their actual plan. Well, they're right back. Stay with us.

[41:55.860 --> 42:00.340]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on there
[42:00.340 --> 42:05.060]  27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you the new world orders
[42:05.060 --> 42:09.220]  breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're
[42:09.220 --> 42:13.780]  doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info wars on the air
[42:13.780 --> 42:17.700]  and please support the local station you're listening to as well. At the same time,
[42:17.700 --> 42:23.380]  go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt,
[42:23.380 --> 42:28.820]  get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[42:28.820 --> 42:34.100]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it
[42:34.100 --> 42:39.380]  if you don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you
[42:39.380 --> 42:45.780]  can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[42:45.780 --> 42:51.220]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[42:51.220 --> 42:56.100]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god. Thank you so much.
[42:57.700 --> 43:01.060]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air.
[43:01.060 --> 43:05.300]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist, that the
[43:05.300 --> 43:08.820]  public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them,
[43:08.820 --> 43:12.820]  that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[43:14.100 --> 43:18.820]  Yes, that's the position of the globalist. They play God and they think because we don't stand up,
[43:18.820 --> 43:24.340]  they have a right to do this to us. And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me,
[43:24.340 --> 43:27.780]  they've tried to get me to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level,
[43:27.780 --> 43:33.220]  I have the whole experience. I'm the connection to God. And I know that God does not like that,
[43:33.220 --> 43:39.300]  so I cannot join the enemy. But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people
[43:39.300 --> 43:43.380]  that go along with the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on it.
[43:44.020 --> 43:48.980]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[43:49.860 --> 43:54.980]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of
[43:54.980 --> 44:00.980]  the universe doesn't like. And that's a fact. The people are awakening. They're taking control
[44:00.980 --> 44:05.620]  of their own environment. Cell phones are an amazing tool. Really, they're a super computer
[44:05.620 --> 44:10.980]  that's handheld. But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the
[44:10.980 --> 44:17.540]  CHICOMS especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig
[44:17.540 --> 44:22.740]  markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record
[44:22.740 --> 44:30.020]  what's going to happen in mass movements. Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates
[44:30.020 --> 44:35.380]  their AI takeover. In their own words, they admit it. So, I've been selling privacy pouches and
[44:35.380 --> 44:39.460]  blocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade. And now the units have gotten really
[44:39.460 --> 44:44.660]  lightweight. They're Faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great.
[44:44.660 --> 44:49.860]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[44:49.860 --> 44:53.300]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's other
[44:53.300 --> 44:56.340]  business. Get yours at infostore.com today.
[44:56.340 --> 45:26.100]  Well, Joe Biden didn't just come out and lie about President Trump yesterday and say that
[45:26.980 --> 45:30.180]  he sends children to starve to death. So, we're just going to take anybody that comes here
[45:30.820 --> 45:39.540]  so they can be packed 26 to a person into little foster homes and the kidnappers can just grab them
[45:39.540 --> 45:44.260]  as they get into the country free card. It's just mass evil out on the open, just like giving us
[45:44.260 --> 45:49.300]  experimental vaccines. And so, you've got to have these to get an airplane or a flyer or across the
[45:49.300 --> 45:55.940]  border. But, oh, the illegal aliens, they don't get tested for COVID. It's all simply a power grab.
[45:56.660 --> 46:02.820]  And coming up next hour, I'm going to go over some of those Biden highlights from the insane
[46:02.820 --> 46:10.340]  event that took place where he says Trump killed children starving to death. I guess they moved
[46:10.340 --> 46:18.580]  on from having them cages, which again was Biden, Obama years ago and now Biden today,
[46:18.580 --> 46:24.260]  not Trump. Again, the murdering of the truth, the murdering of justice. We'll have those clips for
[46:24.260 --> 46:29.780]  you coming up next hour. There's quite a few of them and I want to go over them. But first,
[46:29.780 --> 46:35.700]  for TV viewers, we did find the clip where he is smirking. So, here's Biden being asked about
[46:35.700 --> 46:40.260]  human trafficking in the border and he just makes this really evil demonic face. And when you know
[46:40.260 --> 46:45.620]  the background of what he does, his pedophile family, all the Satanism, all the corruption,
[46:45.620 --> 46:50.180]  all the sniffing and grabbing little girls, and all the protection of the Clintons and Jeffrey
[46:50.180 --> 46:54.500]  FC and the rest of it, it really does tell you a thousand words. Here it is.
[46:55.940 --> 47:01.460]  Thanks so much, Mr. President. You've said over and over again that immigrants shouldn't come to
[47:01.460 --> 47:05.620]  this country right now. This isn't the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead,
[47:05.620 --> 47:11.060]  the perception of you that got you elected as a moral decent man is the reason why a lot of
[47:11.060 --> 47:14.500]  immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors.
[47:14.500 --> 47:20.580]  How do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can
[47:20.580 --> 47:24.740]  go, given the fact that even though with Title 42, there are some families that are staying.
[47:24.740 --> 47:29.540]  And is there a timeline for when we won't be seeing these overcrowded facilities
[47:29.540 --> 47:33.060]  which run by CPB when it comes to unaccompanied minors?
[47:34.740 --> 47:43.780]  You mean the CCP? Let's go ahead now and play that clip that I said I'd play next hour.
[47:43.780 --> 47:51.060]  Let's go ahead and play it right now. This is Joe Biden telling a just gigantic whopper lie that
[47:51.060 --> 47:57.460]  Trump's killing children. No, you saying come across all these countries, all these borders,
[47:57.460 --> 48:01.060]  come through all these smugglers. They admit it to a third of the kids that have been kidnapped
[48:01.060 --> 48:06.100]  or being illegally smuggled by other than their family. That children are sometimes dozens of
[48:06.100 --> 48:09.940]  times brought back and forth over the border as they get into the country free card. I mean,
[48:09.940 --> 48:14.900]  do I need to play soccer again saying last week, 10 years older, younger, bring them,
[48:14.900 --> 48:19.940]  you get in the country? Or Biden saying immediately serves the border. If I get elected,
[48:19.940 --> 48:23.780]  this is what they did. They're wearing Biden shirts. They're waving Biden flags. The media says,
[48:23.780 --> 48:29.380]  oh no, Trump's claim that Biden's causes crisis is false. We fact checked it. It's Trump's fault.
[48:30.020 --> 48:35.060]  And it's not even about defending Trump. It's about defending reality. So here is Joe Biden.
[48:35.060 --> 48:41.860]  I'd like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons
[48:41.860 --> 48:46.580]  that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year.
[48:46.580 --> 48:51.220]  You've blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip
[48:51.220 --> 48:58.580]  to the border where I met nine-year-old Joseph, who walked here from Honduras by himself,
[48:58.580 --> 49:03.780]  along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him. And we were able to call his family,
[49:03.780 --> 49:10.580]  his mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not
[49:10.580 --> 49:16.020]  deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That's why she sent him alone from Honduras.
[49:16.660 --> 49:21.300]  So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging and saying that these
[49:21.300 --> 49:26.180]  children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process,
[49:26.180 --> 49:38.420]  encouraging families like Joe says to come? Well, look, the idea that I'm going to say,
[49:39.860 --> 49:44.500]  which I would never do, that if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're just going to
[49:44.500 --> 49:51.620]  let them starve to death and stay on the other side. No previous administration is dead either,
[49:51.620 --> 49:59.140]  except Trump. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. That's why I've asked the vice
[49:59.140 --> 50:06.580]  president of the United States yesterday to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the
[50:06.580 --> 50:12.100]  fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador in the first place.
[50:15.060 --> 50:20.580]  They've done surveys, and the number one answer over 60 percent of the time is our country has
[50:20.580 --> 50:24.660]  collapsed. We're starving. The lockdowns have killed us. Our countries are still locked down.
[50:24.660 --> 50:30.340]  We're starving to death. We do not have jobs. If we go to the UN refugee centers built to bring
[50:30.340 --> 50:36.980]  them in, like Mazda Flame, they are then taken up to the Guatemala and the Mexican border and then
[50:37.700 --> 50:42.180]  trans shipped in to our country. And the Mexican president has said it's wrong. He's fighting
[50:42.180 --> 50:47.060]  against it. He says Biden is to blame, but you don't see it on our news because, again,
[50:47.060 --> 50:52.100]  I did it. Mexico and the U.S. can work in solidarity under Trump. They don't want that known.
[50:53.700 --> 50:56.580]  The Mexican president went and met with Trump repeatedly. He came out and said that's a great
[50:56.580 --> 50:59.780]  guy. I want to work with him. He wants to empower everybody, Americans and Mexicans,
[50:59.780 --> 51:05.140]  because Trump did. Trump wanted to cut out the middleman and not have all these billionaires
[51:05.140 --> 51:09.940]  that get 90 percent of the money, but actually have trade deals that created a giant Mexican middle
[51:09.940 --> 51:15.620]  class. And boy, that's not going to be allowed to happen either, because I guess you let people
[51:15.620 --> 51:19.060]  become middle class while they start thinking they have rights. We're not going to let that happen.
[51:20.420 --> 51:26.020]  Humans create incredible wealth, folks. We have desire. The problem is, is that there are elites
[51:26.020 --> 51:30.580]  that are always trying to suppress us, building what we can build. Look what America already built.
[51:30.580 --> 51:36.340]  1955, we had over 50 percent of the world's wealth, 4 percent of the world population.
[51:36.340 --> 51:40.420]  Now we've got like 25 percent of the wealth and we're 5 percent of the population.
[51:40.420 --> 51:46.980]  What's happening? Well, the media tells you, the universities tell you, because they're paid for
[51:46.980 --> 51:51.860]  by the big banks, they want to get rid of this American system, that what really happened there
[51:51.860 --> 51:58.100]  is America went and stole all that wealth. No, America created the industries that created the
[51:58.100 --> 52:04.100]  wealth. That's the American system. And that's why the mercantile and communist systems and elite
[52:04.100 --> 52:10.100]  systems and crony capitalist systems see it as anathema. That's why they can't make cars or
[52:10.100 --> 52:17.780]  spaceships in Cuba. But they were prosperous before because communism is designed to put you
[52:17.780 --> 52:23.860]  in a dark age. Even the idea of American freedom, only a small portion of freedom that we ever
[52:23.860 --> 52:30.100]  actually exercised created more wealth than all the world combined. And now it's being siphoned
[52:30.100 --> 52:35.860]  off into the New World Order. We're being sabotaged by design. Populism is being destroyed. It's
[52:35.860 --> 52:40.180]  being done deliberately. And that's the ultimate sin of this. You've got all these leftists that
[52:40.180 --> 52:45.300]  have gone to colleges now who know this and want to preside over the takeover because they're evil.
[52:45.940 --> 52:49.700]  But the average schmuck with two or three grieves that works for the globalist will
[52:49.700 --> 52:55.700]  have nothing at the end of this. They're fools. But they love being patted on the head by the
[52:55.700 --> 53:02.660]  establishment. The average Democrat knows that they are part of the establishment. They know
[53:02.660 --> 53:07.140]  they're minions of the elite. They are not the resistance. They are the establishment. And it
[53:07.140 --> 53:14.580]  is truly disgusting. Here, let's get all blurs. I've seen this clip so many times. I'm turning
[53:14.580 --> 53:21.140]  into Joe Biden. Let's play the clip of the reporter talking about how moral and good he is. Compare
[53:21.140 --> 53:28.020]  this to how they treated Trump. Mr. President, you've said over and over again that immigrants
[53:28.020 --> 53:31.860]  shouldn't come to this country right now. This isn't the time to come. That message is not being
[53:31.860 --> 53:37.460]  received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected as a moral, decent man is the
[53:37.460 --> 53:40.820]  reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied
[53:40.820 --> 53:47.460]  minors. That's enough. That's one part where he's a moral, decent, chai-com agent. That's that same
[53:47.460 --> 53:53.460]  lady that used to just savage Trump viciously with all of her fake moral consternation. It's
[53:53.460 --> 53:58.900]  disgusting. All right. It's now in the Washington Post and New York Times everywhere. These sound
[53:58.900 --> 54:03.380]  like emporers have lines from 20 years ago. The everyday chemical that might be leading us to our
[54:03.380 --> 54:09.700]  extinction. Oh, I'm sure the globalists aren't involved in that. And it's all done by design.
[54:11.540 --> 54:16.260]  We're going to be laying all that out. And then, oh, study chemical that causes penises to shrink
[54:16.260 --> 54:22.180]  found in face masks. How convenient. Oh, and here's a funny meme we saw out there.
[54:22.180 --> 54:29.060]  Biden will never get my guns. I keep them upstairs. So there you go. I'm going to tell you about
[54:29.060 --> 54:33.460]  medicalization, what that term really means, and some studies associated with it. Really,
[54:33.460 --> 54:37.140]  the key to the whole COVID takeover and the key to defeating them will open the phones up
[54:37.140 --> 54:41.700]  and take your calls. And we've got so much more. The former CDC director now confirms that Dr.
[54:41.700 --> 54:46.900]  Francis Boyle said 13 months ago here that it came out of the Wuhan lab. That's Forbes,
[54:46.900 --> 54:52.980]  former CDC director tells CNN he was coronavirus escape from a lab in Wuhan. Let's see back when
[54:52.980 --> 54:56.900]  Trump was saying that. Oh, he's a big liar because it was about bringing America down. Now the
[54:56.900 --> 55:00.660]  globalists are back to fighting with China. And hey, respect us, China. And they don't respect
[55:00.660 --> 55:05.380]  the globalists. So now the globalists are going, oh, you're buying the COVID now because they're
[55:05.380 --> 55:10.180]  getting bitch slapped by Gigi Ping. They weren't cool enough to run the country and build it up
[55:10.180 --> 55:15.700]  because they got the small pee pee syndrome. They've got the chicken, you know what crap dimension
[55:15.700 --> 55:20.820]  where they just want to run it in the ground, just like they want to kidnap your kids and torture
[55:20.820 --> 55:23.700]  the hell out of them. And you're like, why would you want to do that? Because they're scum, because
[55:23.700 --> 55:27.700]  they're evil. They don't like good things. They want to watch the world burn. And if you let them
[55:27.700 --> 55:34.020]  burn it, they will. A bunch of psycho scum running things. Hour number two straight ahead.
[55:34.820 --> 55:40.900]  Please support us infowarstore.com. We'll be right back with hour number two infowars.com.

[56:41.860 --> 56:49.700]  savings and it funds the info war, a 360 win. In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie
[56:49.700 --> 56:58.900]  that came out called Wayne's World. Even before I had access to the show in the mid 1990s,
[56:58.900 --> 57:04.020]  I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that looks fun. Back to speak out and have your own
[57:04.020 --> 57:08.260]  ideas. And even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well, what
[57:08.260 --> 57:15.060]  do they say in Wayne's World? We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these huge
[57:15.060 --> 57:19.140]  topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real.
[57:19.140 --> 57:22.580]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right. And most of the time we do.
[57:22.580 --> 57:26.660]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy
[57:26.660 --> 57:32.900]  destroying humanity. They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[57:32.900 --> 57:37.940]  That for me is really such a disgusting. So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole
[57:37.940 --> 57:44.260]  info wars crew that we will never join the globalists. We will never know and manipulate you
[57:44.260 --> 57:51.860]  because we know we're all in this together. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:51.860 --> 58:03.300]  We must take the vaccine. I'm not asking what's in the infusion. I'm not looking up all of the
[58:03.300 --> 58:10.980]  ingredients in the infusion. I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[58:12.500 --> 58:18.740]  And that's what we have to do. Our fellow Americans right now, the COVID-19 vaccines
[58:18.740 --> 58:24.900]  are available to millions of Americans and soon they will be available to everyone. The science
[58:24.900 --> 58:29.780]  is clear. These vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly
[58:29.780 --> 58:35.220]  disease. They could save your life. So we urge you to get vaccinated when it's available to you.
[58:35.220 --> 58:51.140]  That's the first step to ending the pandemic and moving our country forward. It's up to you.
[59:05.220 --> 59:11.060]  I will inspire time for us to trust and not debate. The vaccine believe it's safe to take.
[59:11.940 --> 59:18.260]  It's vaccination day. It's vaccination day. It's vaccination day.
[59:18.260 --> 59:22.900]  Appointments are open and I'm group four. I don't have to stay here anymore.
[59:22.900 --> 59:30.820]  I'm sick of eating. Take out on these plates. The time indoors has got me stressed but I just
[59:30.820 --> 59:39.700]  checked on CVS. Finally they're giving me some dates. Yeah, I know it'll take like six weeks
[59:39.700 --> 59:45.700]  until I am totally immune but I am getting out of here real soon.
[59:45.700 --> 59:58.820]  For the first time in forever I can see my dad and mom. For the first time in forever
[59:58.820 --> 1:00:14.820]  all my fear of death is gone. Have a new job. Have a new job. Have a new job. Have a new job.
[1:00:14.820 --> 1:00:32.180]  Have a new job. Well maybe we all get misled. We see this post and our walls are
[1:00:32.180 --> 1:00:41.780]  threatened. They use conspiracy theories just to fool you. It's not needle-pricks to be
[1:00:41.780 --> 1:00:51.780]  scared about the ones who birth this north and south. It's absurd and it's mistaken. Have a new job.
[1:00:53.380 --> 1:01:09.780]  Have a new job. Have a new job. Have a new job. Have a new job.
[1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:16.500]  Our scientists tell us there are three things we must do to stay safe. Wear masks, make sure we
[1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:22.980]  social distance and wash our hands. And now your school with the help of Microsoft Corporation has
[1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:29.540]  created another. Introducing Daily Pass, your exclusive ticket for safely going back to school.
[1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:35.140]  Each week you can schedule your free on-campus COVID test. The results are displayed in your
[1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:40.340]  Daily Pass. And if you choose to take your test off campus, you can post the results in your Daily
[1:01:40.340 --> 1:01:45.860]  Pass. And the moment vaccinations are available. And they admit that all of this has been transferred
[1:01:45.860 --> 1:01:53.060]  into a World ID card travel system for total control. And you heard the little girl singing the
[1:01:53.620 --> 1:02:00.660]  Blasphemous Hallelujah song worshipping the vaccine. You saw that, didn't you? The full reports
[1:02:00.660 --> 1:02:05.380]  that banned out videos saw Bill Gates kick vaccine propaganda in high gear and see the conclusion
[1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:10.020]  there and share it with people. And she said, don't listen to the conspiracy theorists like the
[1:02:10.020 --> 1:02:16.580]  thousands of medical doctors and top urologists and scientists and now a top scientist that was
[1:02:16.580 --> 1:02:21.540]  with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has come out and said, don't take these mRNA vaccines.
[1:02:21.540 --> 1:02:27.780]  They're deadly. But it doesn't matter. This guy has conscripted his children into a propaganda war.
[1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:33.860]  But I have the articles right here where they admit 4,000 dead in Europe from the vaccine.
[1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:40.580]  Experimental, not even a vaccine. But here, the dad's a good dad. He's got his little girls up
[1:02:40.580 --> 1:02:45.140]  there and he's going to use them to tell people, don't question, don't look at conspiracy theories.
[1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:51.860]  Just believe us. Take your shot to skiing people. Black folks, take your shots. We love you.

[1:03:57.380 --> 1:04:05.540]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:13.620]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios. It's Alex Jones. So Bloomberg is reporting that
[1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:18.180]  the pandemic is permanent. They will never defeat the COVID virus because it's a cold virus,
[1:04:18.180 --> 1:04:22.340]  which you never can defeat. But now that we've got to save one life, hundreds of millions got
[1:04:22.340 --> 1:04:26.740]  to starve to death. Everybody's got to go bankrupt. We've got to have millions of suicides. We've just
[1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:30.020]  got to have millions died from not having cancer treatment because you got to pay
[1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:34.100]  to the insurance companies, but they don't give you any treatment back. We've all got to just take
[1:04:34.100 --> 1:04:40.580]  it. Now it's five shots, 10 shots a year. It's the total takeover. Wow, isn't that just incredible?
[1:04:41.140 --> 1:04:50.020]  And a member of the British Supreme Court, Lord, what's his name? Lord Sumpton came on and said,
[1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:58.660]  oh, it's 10 years at least. That's right, 10 years. And the EU's own reporting system says 3,964
[1:04:58.660 --> 1:05:05.060]  dead from the vaccine, 162,000 plus injuries. And of course, one out of 10 deaths or injuries get
[1:05:05.060 --> 1:05:11.220]  reported. And so you can imagine that number is a lot higher. And suddenly it's like, oh,
[1:05:11.220 --> 1:05:14.980]  and once you take the vaccine, you still got to wear a mask and you still are not essential and
[1:05:14.980 --> 1:05:21.780]  you still got to do all this. Oh, really? And who said, oh, the UN, the same ones that launched
[1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:26.660]  the lockdown, but again, has doubled the number of starvation in the last year. But you know,
[1:05:26.660 --> 1:05:30.500]  oh, the alternative media, we're not supposed to be listened to. We've got to be censored.
[1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:36.500]  One of the things we got censored even more for was what we said over a year ago with the
[1:05:37.140 --> 1:05:42.340]  author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law. And it was a main contributor, one of the main
[1:05:42.340 --> 1:05:48.500]  contributors of the UN World Treaties on Bioweapons, Dr. Francis Boyle, professor,
[1:05:50.260 --> 1:05:55.060]  also a war crimes prosecutor, a top war crimes prosecutor. But, you know, what's his pedigree?
[1:05:55.060 --> 1:05:58.500]  You don't listen to him. He said it came out of Wuhan and broke it all down. Well,
[1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:02.980]  now former CDC director tells CNN he believes coronavirus escaped from Wuhan lab.
[1:06:04.580 --> 1:06:08.980]  An exclusivity with CNN and former centers for disease control prevention director,
[1:06:08.980 --> 1:06:13.460]  Dr. Robert Redfield, said he believes the coronavirus likely escaped from a laboratory
[1:06:13.460 --> 1:06:19.380]  in Wuhan, China. And it goes on from there. Folks, it's man made. It was scanned by the
[1:06:19.380 --> 1:06:23.700]  Indians and the Australians with CRISPR. And you can see the five viruses together,
[1:06:23.700 --> 1:06:29.940]  the P-shuttle gene. They actually fire these together. They have to randomly gene done these,
[1:06:29.940 --> 1:06:33.060]  and they'll go through thousands of viruses until they actually make one that
[1:06:33.780 --> 1:06:37.220]  splintered together the way they want. And they take that, then they put it into a pig,
[1:06:37.940 --> 1:06:44.500]  to piglet. If it gets sick and they get a big replication from it, they then feed that piglet
[1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:49.860]  to other pigs. And then the pigs that die from that, they then feed to more pigs. And then they
[1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:55.300]  suck the blood out of those pigs. And then they use centrifuges and a bunch of other systems to
[1:06:55.300 --> 1:07:00.500]  then isolate out the layer that would have viruses in it. And then they get the mass production of
[1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:05.780]  the virus they want. You're like, well, how do they with a virus like microscopically put five
[1:07:05.780 --> 1:07:09.620]  viruses together? That's how they do it. There's a lot of other ways, but mainly they call them
[1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:14.020]  gene guns. And they're just slamming viruses together, slamming them together, slamming them
[1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:20.740]  together till they get the ones they want. Then they grow them up in host. And that's one of the
[1:07:20.740 --> 1:07:26.580]  ways they do it. So just to understand that Bill Gates primed all this in the years before,
[1:07:26.580 --> 1:07:30.500]  all these TV shows he financed where he's the hero and mass deaths coming and
[1:07:31.620 --> 1:07:35.940]  it's going to come out of China. So once you saw it happening, you rolled over, you bowed down,
[1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:40.180]  and now they've got you in the vice grip. And the answer is getting out of the vice grip.
[1:07:40.180 --> 1:07:52.020]  The answer is saying no to the system. So here is something talking about the 10 years.
[1:07:52.980 --> 1:07:57.620]  It's politically unrealistic to expect the governments to backtrack now. They've invested
[1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:03.700]  too much of themselves in it. So although the ideal would be to revert to a voluntary system,
[1:08:03.700 --> 1:08:10.900]  which was what the authorities all recommended before last March, I don't think that that is
[1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:17.060]  going to happen. And I have to say that I'm extremely pessimistic about this. An interesting
[1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:24.900]  parallel. It is the continuation of wartime food rationing after the last war. People were in favour
[1:08:24.900 --> 1:08:29.060]  of that because they were in favour of social control. They'd had a lot of it during the war.
[1:08:29.060 --> 1:08:36.260]  They thought that this was an answer. In the 1950 and 51 general elections, the Labour Party lost
[1:08:36.260 --> 1:08:42.100]  its majority entirely because people with five years more experience of social control got
[1:08:42.100 --> 1:08:49.060]  fed up with it. Sooner or later, that will happen in this country. Yeah, you know, they're saying
[1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:55.140]  in studies that over in the UK that it's one of the most popular places for being dominated by a
[1:08:55.140 --> 1:08:59.620]  dominatrix. I don't like that, but they like that because they dominate other people, although
[1:08:59.620 --> 1:09:04.020]  the government officials do, so they want to be dominated. And so it's a very sycophantic
[1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:08.260]  Stockholm syndrome. Learned to help us, whatever you want to call it. But the truth is they've
[1:09:08.260 --> 1:09:12.980]  had millions marching on the streets. They've had giant rallies in England, in Europe, millions in
[1:09:12.980 --> 1:09:17.060]  Germany, hundreds of thousands in the UK. And there are a lot of people that don't want to be slaves.
[1:09:17.060 --> 1:09:24.580]  So you see this Lord Twit up there. Oh, people want real social control. They really need something
[1:09:24.580 --> 1:09:29.620]  to control them. And it's going to be a 10-year war, like after a little, except
[1:09:31.220 --> 1:09:37.540]  Bill Gates funded the study that said 500,000 people be dead in the UK. And it wasn't even 50,000.
[1:09:37.540 --> 1:09:40.740]  And those were all the things they died from pretty much. Same thing here. They said, oh,
[1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:44.660]  there'll be, there'll be two and a half million dead, 2.3 million dead. And then it was all lies,
[1:09:44.660 --> 1:09:53.460]  folks, all lies. And now, strutting, arrogant, authoritarian, imperious police running around,
[1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:57.060]  slamming and arresting people. Oh, but if you're kidnapped by little girls for grooming gangs,
[1:09:57.060 --> 1:10:02.260]  it's just fine. And if you're a coyote, a smuggler with a bunch of kids you're bringing across,
[1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:08.900]  you know, the Texas border, that's okay too. It's simply insane. I want to play you a clip
[1:10:08.900 --> 1:10:15.780]  from Tucker Carlson last night. A few days ago, he had the Polish immigrant from Michigan,
[1:10:16.820 --> 1:10:22.020]  who had a restaurant that was popular. Hers wasn't allowed to be open. They had these computer
[1:10:22.020 --> 1:10:27.300]  programs in California and everywhere in Michigan that tell you who can be open, who can't. It's
[1:10:27.300 --> 1:10:31.860]  mapped. So the technocrats decided that all the big companies, they could stay open. Well,
[1:10:32.580 --> 1:10:36.180]  they finally let her open at 25%. Well, they caught her having more in than that because
[1:10:36.180 --> 1:10:40.420]  her place is so small, she couldn't stay open. And so they came and fined her and feed her and
[1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:44.100]  grabbed her bank accounts and then took her store over. Well, she went on to Tucker Carlson. That
[1:10:44.100 --> 1:10:50.660]  made them mad. So the globalist former Soros operative, that is their chief law enforcement
[1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:56.420]  officer now, had her arrested and thrown in chains. Here is part of the report.
[1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:01.460]  The state of Michigan has some of the most dangerous cities in America. It's a great
[1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:05.140]  state. It's beautiful, but there's some very dangerous places. Detroit is the most famous,
[1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:10.020]  obviously, but it's not the only one. Muskegon Heights, Kalamazoo, Jackson, Ypsilanti,
[1:11:10.020 --> 1:11:14.180]  all have crime rates far higher than the national average as do other Michigan cities.
[1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:18.900]  In Detroit, violence escalated to new and terrifying levels over the last year.
[1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:22.500]  More than a thousand people were shot in Detroit in the past 12 months.
[1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:28.500]  So Dana Nessel is the attorney general of Michigan. As the state's chief law enforcement officer,
[1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:32.100]  you think she would be very concerned about all those people getting murdered in her state,
[1:11:32.100 --> 1:11:36.820]  but she's not concerned. Nor is Nessel bothered to investigate her governor, Gretchen Whitmer,
[1:11:36.820 --> 1:11:40.980]  who, like Andrew Cuomo, is responsible for the deaths of so many nursing home residents from
[1:11:40.980 --> 1:11:45.460]  COVID. Gretchen Whitmer is Dana Nessel's political ally, so she's getting a pass completely.
[1:11:45.460 --> 1:11:50.420]  Dana Nessel has better things to do than stop murders or figure out why elderly people are
[1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:55.460]  dying. She has instead marshaled the full force of the state to crush a single disobedient
[1:11:55.460 --> 1:11:59.780]  restaurant owner, a Polish immigrant called Marlena Pavloz-Hakni, whom we've had on the show.
[1:12:00.580 --> 1:12:06.340]  Pavloz-Hakni's crime was disobeying state corona regulations, so last week Nessel had her handcuffed
[1:12:06.340 --> 1:12:11.540]  and arrested in a sting operation she drove to work. Keep in mind that there is no proof
[1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:17.860]  that Pavloz-Hakni is responsible for a single COVID infection, not one, no proof. But Dana Nessel
[1:12:17.860 --> 1:12:22.340]  sent her to jail anyway and then issued a highly self-righteous press release bragging that she
[1:12:22.340 --> 1:12:27.060]  did it. Pavloz-Hakni was released from jail yesterday, but only because officials determined
[1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:31.780]  that her highly dangerous restaurant had been completely closed down. It's hard to imagine
[1:12:31.780 --> 1:12:35.460]  a more disproportionate response than this, but for those who've watched Dana Nessel for the
[1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:40.420]  past two years is not surprising. Dana Nessel is out of control. She's an ideologue. She cares only
[1:12:40.420 --> 1:12:45.300]  about partisan advantage. She should be impeached by the Michigan legislature for her many abuses
[1:12:45.300 --> 1:12:50.180]  of power. She's that corrupt, but she's also a bit of a dim bulb, not a super genius, and that's
[1:12:50.180 --> 1:12:55.700]  why when she was asked why she put Marlena Pavloz-Hakni in jail, Nessel actually admitted the
[1:12:55.700 --> 1:12:59.460]  real reason. She didn't make up some fake legal principles. She said straightforwardly that
[1:12:59.460 --> 1:13:05.620]  Marlena Pavloz-Hakni had dared to come on this show at 8 p.m. and complain about her. That's no
[1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:10.420]  longer allowed. And to compound the offense, Pavloz-Hakni tried to raise money for her own
[1:13:10.420 --> 1:13:16.820]  legal defense, and that too is now a crime in Dana Nessel's Michigan. Sound like America to you?
[1:13:16.820 --> 1:13:21.620]  Oh no, it doesn't. It sounds like dictatorship. Dana Nessel is a threat to the rule of law,
[1:13:21.620 --> 1:13:25.700]  the law that she is charged with enforcing, and she should be removed immediately.
[1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:30.980]  When people like this take positions like Attorney General, it's not a joke.
[1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:37.860]  Perfectly said by the great Tucker, and of course, you know, that lady did directly work with George
[1:13:37.860 --> 1:13:41.780]  Soros, and she helped carry out the election fraud, and she does whatever the hell she wants.
[1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:46.100]  When we come back, do you know the New York Times is calling for taking people's URLs away,
[1:13:46.100 --> 1:13:50.500]  or having them blocked and delisted, and I'm gonna tell you what medicalization is to understand
[1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:56.740]  this entire takeover. You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet.
[1:13:56.740 --> 1:14:00.580]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have a lot of
[1:14:00.580 --> 1:14:03.460]  credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order.
[1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:08.660]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer,
[1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:12.580]  and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't
[1:14:12.580 --> 1:14:16.980]  tell you what's going on, but let's just say this. We're gonna see this through the end. We're gonna
[1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:22.180]  stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us, and please buy the products, and then

[1:14:31.620 --> 1:14:37.060]  great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for
[1:14:37.060 --> 1:14:41.380]  truth. That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave

[1:15:52.100 --> 1:16:10.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:22.100 --> 1:16:29.300]  It was, I don't know, four or five years ago I asked Gavin McGinnis on air,
[1:16:30.180 --> 1:16:36.020]  what the peak of leftist SJW Insanity would be, and he said there is no peak. They will just
[1:16:36.020 --> 1:16:40.660]  continue to get crazier and crazier until we stop them or civilization collapses, and I can tell you
[1:16:40.660 --> 1:16:44.900]  here four or five years later on the Alex Jones show, I totally agree with him. I thought they
[1:16:44.900 --> 1:16:49.140]  would peak out within a year or so, but they are so self-destructive, the propaganda is so
[1:16:49.140 --> 1:16:54.500]  insane, and once you commit to a lie, these people don't ever admit they're wrong. I mean,
[1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:59.140]  when I've been wrong about things in my life, I've learned from it and gotten better,
[1:16:59.860 --> 1:17:05.220]  and I've still got plenty of problems, but these people are invincibly ignorant. I mean,
[1:17:05.220 --> 1:17:08.660]  look at these headlines. We're not even trying to find headlines like this, they're just everywhere.
[1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:13.220]  I've got probably 30 articles just as bad as this today. It's on importwars.com,
[1:17:14.180 --> 1:17:18.820]  and it links directly to the local news promoting all this like it's completely normal.
[1:17:18.820 --> 1:17:25.940]  California approves ethnic studies curriculum that encourages a counter genocide against whites.
[1:17:28.260 --> 1:17:31.460]  That's the California Board of Education, it's not some quack professor,
[1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:36.580]  approved a new ethnic studies school curriculum that has students chant to the Aztec God of
[1:17:36.580 --> 1:17:40.980]  Human Sacrifice and encourages a counter genocide against white Christians. Now,
[1:17:41.620 --> 1:17:47.380]  I could talk for four hours of a show just on this article and cover every facet of it and debunk
[1:17:47.380 --> 1:17:52.820]  these people and teach those that are being taught this that the big banks are funding it.
[1:17:52.820 --> 1:17:56.900]  It's called liberation theology. It's a way to break down society. It's the way to make sure
[1:17:56.900 --> 1:18:01.300]  all the ethnic groups stay apart and that we're segregated so we can be controlled, divide and
[1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:07.060]  conquer. I could explain how that was done in India, how the British Empire did it with a few
[1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:11.620]  thousand troops, controlled over 100 million people. I mean, I could break it down. I could
[1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:17.540]  explain how the Aztecs dominated Mesoamerica and sacrificed up to 100,000 people a year
[1:18:17.540 --> 1:18:22.740]  and went around and had all the neighboring tribes enslaved and their main meat product was their
[1:18:22.740 --> 1:18:28.660]  enemy's children. The priests would butcher people on top of the platforms all day long
[1:18:28.660 --> 1:18:33.220]  and then they were taken down into the lower priesthood, had these shops, I've been to these
[1:18:33.220 --> 1:18:38.020]  places where they would hang the people to be eaten, to be caught up and eaten, you'd come and get
[1:18:38.020 --> 1:18:42.180]  the slice you wanted. And I'm not putting people down that have this in their background. Most
[1:18:42.180 --> 1:18:48.660]  cultures did things along these lines. The Aztecs brought it to a level never foreseen of an assembly
[1:18:48.660 --> 1:18:53.940]  line of cannibalism and you go down there, they'll teach you that. That's all that you'll have
[1:18:53.940 --> 1:18:59.620]  Mayan teaching you that. Oh, but the white scholars, you know, try to lie about it. So that's what's
[1:18:59.620 --> 1:19:04.100]  crazy is, I mean, were Europeans hanging up the Indians and eating them like this, the Native
[1:19:04.100 --> 1:19:09.060]  Americans. Now, the truth is, when the settlers got here, the Native Americans came to them and
[1:19:09.060 --> 1:19:14.580]  said, if you don't help us, overtake the next tribe, we'll kill you. And the settlers went,
[1:19:14.580 --> 1:19:18.500]  okay, sure, that's how it is from our country. We got to join your group or you're going to kill
[1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:22.740]  us, all right, we'll join your group. And it was this group backstabbing that group that, I mean,
[1:19:22.740 --> 1:19:26.660]  that's the reality. You want to see an accurate breakdown, it was put into a fictional book,
[1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:30.580]  Last of the Mohicans, it got made into a movie, that was a composite of real characters and real
[1:19:30.580 --> 1:19:34.660]  events that happened. Go watch the Last of the Mohicans, if you want to understand all this,
[1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:40.500]  where it's a bunch of different factions killing each other. The idea that we need to kill white
[1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:47.540]  people is absurd and pure evil and is designed to create total division in this country.
[1:19:49.700 --> 1:19:52.900]  And what the Aztecs would do is they'd go capture their enemies, yeah, keep rolling
[1:19:52.900 --> 1:19:58.340]  from Apocalypse. It's a very historic breakdown of it. They would grab the enemy men, they would
[1:19:58.340 --> 1:20:01.620]  grab the enemy children, they would grab the enemy women and they would kill them.
[1:20:03.780 --> 1:20:09.620]  And so, oh, so they were so good, all ethnically worked together with their other Mesoamericans
[1:20:09.620 --> 1:20:14.580]  until the evil white people showed up. When Cortez showed up with like 200-something men
[1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:20.580]  and a couple horses, the Aztecs were so whacked out of their mind in Mexico City
[1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:25.220]  that they first thought they were gods because they were wearing armor and they had that in
[1:20:25.220 --> 1:20:29.220]  their iconography of like space aliens and nudes and suits like that. And so they thought they
[1:20:29.220 --> 1:20:33.540]  were space aliens when they showed up. And they said that a thousand men could have conquered
[1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:39.860]  the whole country because it was all totally insane. The high priest were chopping their balls off,
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:45.220]  taking long strings with obsidian through their tongues and then taking hallucinogens and going
[1:20:45.220 --> 1:20:50.580]  and like sitting there talking to Cortez, like swapping around in pain. And they're just like,
[1:20:50.580 --> 1:20:57.220]  what the hell is going on here? Children hanging up, being chopped up, being fed on. I mean,
[1:20:57.220 --> 1:21:04.500]  this is beyond any road warrior scenario you ever imagined. Oh, but now we need to worship it all.
[1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:11.380]  It's such a superior culture of the Aztecs. The Aztecs were the worst of the worst in the
[1:21:11.380 --> 1:21:15.220]  declining culture. When they started out doing human sacrifice 10,000 years ago in Mesoamerica,
[1:21:15.220 --> 1:21:20.180]  they might do it once a year. It then degenerated into what it was. And I just said I wasn't a
[1:21:20.180 --> 1:21:23.540]  cover a bunch of stuff this segment. I pretty much just covered one story. Hey, let me, let me
[1:21:23.540 --> 1:21:28.340]  continue. A California-approved ethnic studies curriculum that encourages counter-genociding
[1:21:28.340 --> 1:21:34.900]  its whites in an Aztec culture. Yeah, that'll work real well. White liberals claim Black Latino
[1:21:34.900 --> 1:21:40.100]  car club meetings are too masculine. This is in Texas monthly. And by the way, I've been on
[1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:44.500]  the Hike and Bike Trail forever. They've had those big car meetup things forever. And as it
[1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:48.340]  gentrifies in those neighborhoods, they literally say, we don't want them congregating. They don't
[1:21:48.340 --> 1:21:52.420]  wear masks and we're scared of the blacks and Hispanics. There's white folks over there too.
[1:21:53.060 --> 1:21:57.540]  White liberals claim Black Latino car club meetings are too masculine and are gentrifying
[1:21:57.540 --> 1:22:03.940]  minority neighborhood. Trendy gentrifying liberals claim Black Latino car clubs are a display
[1:22:03.940 --> 1:22:09.460]  of toxic masculinity. And they want it banned. They don't, you cannot have people meeting over
[1:22:09.460 --> 1:22:15.140]  by the park and barbecuing and they're eating meat and they've got cars and the men have got
[1:22:15.140 --> 1:22:20.020]  muscles either. And there's women out there. They're having a good time. Let me tell you,
[1:22:20.020 --> 1:22:26.500]  when do I have a good time? Go hang out with those folks. I've done it a lot. Dallas and Austin.
[1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:31.620]  Let's continue. If you need any acid, you found there too. Alex Jones still sells supplements
[1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:38.980]  on Amazon despite ban from other platforms. Oh, remember that? Big NPR yesterday? Well,
[1:22:38.980 --> 1:22:48.340]  now there's this today. New York Times horrified that Alex Jones could still be found via Google
[1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:52.260]  podcast. And then they misrepresent that Google is streaming our servers and that Google is putting
[1:22:52.260 --> 1:22:58.100]  us out. No, it's just listed in a podcast, directory of podcast and then sends you on a link.
[1:22:58.100 --> 1:23:04.020]  So what they're calling for and the ADL is as well is taking and linking away and they're
[1:23:04.020 --> 1:23:09.460]  calling for Google to completely delist us. Then they add some more slander and defamation.
[1:23:09.460 --> 1:23:15.460]  They say that I'm a Nazi. Yes, because I'm not like George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[1:23:15.460 --> 1:23:20.740]  You can go read it for yourself where they say Alex Jones and everyone else must be delisted.
[1:23:21.700 --> 1:23:25.620]  You must not be able to find them when you search on a search engine. They've already pushed us
[1:23:25.620 --> 1:23:30.580]  down. They've already put lies on top of us, but that's not enough. Now they want IP addresses
[1:23:30.580 --> 1:23:35.940]  blocked and that's the next frontier. I'll talk more about that later today, but I wanted to go
[1:23:35.940 --> 1:23:42.020]  over that. Meanwhile, over in the UK, teaching and hiding as Prophet Muhammad protests continue
[1:23:42.020 --> 1:23:46.660]  for a second day. Now the Muslims don't just want you to not burn the Quran. They don't want any
[1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:53.460]  criticism of Muhammad or to say he's not God or the Prophet is not God's prophet, then you are dead.
[1:23:53.460 --> 1:24:02.740]  Also, experts provide tools to raise woke children, anti-racist baby and drag queen,
[1:24:03.540 --> 1:24:12.740]  which means pedophile. And it goes on and on and on and on. This is the disease of these
[1:24:12.740 --> 1:24:18.260]  godless out of control people that now want us to submit to their entire takeover and their
[1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:22.980]  entire system. It's just amazing. Now when we come back, I will get to what I got behind covering
[1:24:22.980 --> 1:24:28.660]  all that. Medicalization. What does that mean? Medicalization. That doesn't mean you went and
[1:24:28.660 --> 1:24:33.780]  got put in the hospital. What is medicalization? We'll tell you on the other side. It ties into
[1:24:33.780 --> 1:24:38.580]  everything we're facing. It's the form of technocracy that we're under. It's the leading edge.
[1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:44.980]  It's the it's the Berserkers spear. It's their sword. It's the battering ram knocking us down
[1:24:44.980 --> 1:24:50.500]  at our gates and it's already reached the gates. And now the city is on metaphysical fire.
[1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:56.820]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. I've been on there 27
[1:24:56.820 --> 1:25:01.060]  years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you, the New World Order is
[1:25:01.060 --> 1:25:05.140]  breathing down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're
[1:25:05.140 --> 1:25:09.940]  doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info wars on the air and

[1:26:00.500 --> 1:26:06.100]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[1:26:06.100 --> 1:26:10.900]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up
[1:26:10.900 --> 1:26:16.580]  with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last
[1:26:16.580 --> 1:26:24.020]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55 years old and I
[1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:28.420]  was already taking your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need
[1:26:28.420 --> 1:26:32.980]  to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking it, I mean
[1:26:32.980 --> 1:26:39.060]  it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started noticing, okay, you know
[1:26:39.060 --> 1:26:44.580]  this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know. I don't have to put on
[1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:50.100]  derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[1:26:50.100 --> 1:27:00.100]  cleared up my skin. As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy,

[1:27:52.420 --> 1:28:01.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:23.380 --> 1:28:28.740]  And we are back live. We are broadcasting worldwide. Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:28:28.740 --> 1:28:32.900]  Very thankful for all of you tuning in. I'm very thankful for all of you remembering that the only
[1:28:32.900 --> 1:28:38.420]  way this information gets out is when you share it and that the globalists in their entire system
[1:28:38.420 --> 1:28:43.300]  dreads the fact that this broadcast is still on air and they hate the fact that we have a connection
[1:28:43.300 --> 1:28:47.060]  and that we're communicating and that we're fighting back. You've got my commitment to not
[1:28:47.060 --> 1:28:52.340]  back down, to not waver one bit, to not mince words and you've seen how much more hardcore we've
[1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:57.780]  gotten as things intensify. And of course, I knew all this stuff a long time ago. That's why I laid
[1:28:57.780 --> 1:29:03.860]  a lot of it out before anybody else did. But I mean, I held back on some of it because I just
[1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:08.020]  knew people weren't ready to handle it. I've known for a long time that it's definitely
[1:29:08.900 --> 1:29:13.700]  species of aliens or something running this. The Bible calls it Satan and it's here to kill
[1:29:13.700 --> 1:29:18.340]  us and destroy us and it works for humans and that's the plan it's setting up. But everybody
[1:29:18.340 --> 1:29:23.300]  now goes, yeah, you can tell that's what it is. I mean, the people running this are not human.
[1:29:23.940 --> 1:29:28.260]  They're being influenced by something very, very destructive, very, very wicked,
[1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:35.780]  and every culture knows that. Every culture understands that. And so you call it what you
[1:29:35.780 --> 1:29:39.380]  want. It's here to kill us. It's here to destroy humanity and it's here to get our children.
[1:29:41.060 --> 1:29:44.580]  And it didn't matter if you were the Aztecs or you didn't matter if you were the Tibetans or
[1:29:44.580 --> 1:29:49.540]  the matter of the ancient Druids. That was the cosmology that they had. So when you're from
[1:29:49.540 --> 1:29:55.940]  devil worshipers that the devil is a Christian concept, that's not even true. And the devil's
[1:29:55.940 --> 1:30:00.740]  biggest trick was teaching the world he didn't exist. There is a force, there is a force five
[1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:06.180]  times stronger than our third dimension dark matter that the scientists approved was there
[1:30:06.180 --> 1:30:10.100]  and they've now been able to scan it and read it. And that's why you don't have any atheists now in
[1:30:10.100 --> 1:30:14.740]  the globalist ranks that they're not. None of them believe that. That was always just to get
[1:30:14.740 --> 1:30:18.820]  people away from God so that people didn't understand what was happening. And that doesn't
[1:30:18.820 --> 1:30:25.220]  mean churches is where you find God. Most of these churches absolutely have bad doctrines
[1:30:25.220 --> 1:30:29.620]  and they give me the willies and they all fight with each other. And I'm not up here telling you
[1:30:29.620 --> 1:30:33.140]  I got all the answers. I'm not here telling you how to be the best Christian or the best person
[1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:36.580]  of the connection to God. I'm just telling you I've been around globalists. I've studied them.
[1:30:36.580 --> 1:30:42.500]  And here's an example. I went to Scullin' Bones but I was in Connecticut on a different mission
[1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:50.020]  last week and I'm sitting there, you know Scullin' Bones is only 40 minutes away from where we were.
[1:30:50.580 --> 1:30:56.500]  I said we should go there. Once we got back on Tuesday, we were there on Monday of just this
[1:30:56.500 --> 1:31:01.780]  week, sorry, it seems like 100 years ago. And Rob Do that went with me along with Tim Inlow.
[1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:11.460]  He said, he said, Alex, he said, do you realize we were there on 322?
[1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:21.540]  Do you realize that that's their big sacred number, their big sacred day, their lodge,
[1:31:21.540 --> 1:31:28.500]  it has all these meanings back to the Egyptian sundial and an equation that goes into 666.
[1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:32.340]  And I was like, oh my gosh, how would that happen? It was very strange.
[1:31:33.540 --> 1:31:40.340]  Synchronicity, serendipity, I don't know which one you would say that is,
[1:31:40.340 --> 1:31:44.020]  but it was very, very strange. Okay, let's go ahead and get into this right now.
[1:31:49.220 --> 1:31:50.580]  What is medicalization?
[1:31:50.580 --> 1:31:56.500]  That doesn't mean you got put in the hospital.
[1:31:59.700 --> 1:32:06.260]  That means you have gotten into a system that's basically in the same flavor of hypochondria
[1:32:08.660 --> 1:32:13.540]  or moonshowsons or moonshowsons by proxy. Those are all just psychological subdivisions
[1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:19.060]  of this historic phenomenon. But what you have is the cult of medical science.
[1:32:19.060 --> 1:32:23.540]  It's always had problems, always had abuses, always had some mad scientist involved.
[1:32:25.060 --> 1:32:30.580]  Now controlled by the robber barons in the last 200 years who believe in social Darwinism and
[1:32:30.580 --> 1:32:39.780]  Nazism and communism and might makes right authoritarianism. And so medicalization
[1:32:39.780 --> 1:32:47.700]  is when the medical mafia takes over through a medical tyranny or a technocracy.
[1:32:49.540 --> 1:32:55.540]  And where they create problems to which there is no solution. Or they give you drugs that
[1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:58.100]  actually make you sick and they know it's going to make you sick down the road,
[1:32:58.100 --> 1:33:02.580]  so they then have new treatments for the new diseases that they have invented.
[1:33:04.340 --> 1:33:08.180]  And so that's really where all the power and control is. And that's what Gates and Fauci
[1:33:08.180 --> 1:33:11.540]  have all been involved with with the Chinese is the development of bio weapons, the name of
[1:33:11.540 --> 1:33:15.140]  countering them. So anybody can even go to Wikipedia. And Wikipedia is not always completely
[1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:18.420]  accurate, but on medicalization it's a great resource. It's got a lot of great footnotes
[1:33:19.220 --> 1:33:23.540]  and psychological and medical papers by prestigious institutions on the subject of
[1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:30.740]  medicalization and really predictions similar to what Eisenhower said about a psychological,
[1:33:30.740 --> 1:33:35.540]  technological, scientifically controlling the military industrial complex. That was always
[1:33:35.540 --> 1:33:39.780]  the full 21 minute speech, not just beware the military industrial complex. He said,
[1:33:39.780 --> 1:33:47.140]  run by the scientific technocrats because they were coming to him with all these proposals
[1:33:47.140 --> 1:33:51.220]  of what they've set up today. They came to Eisenhower with the intergalactic communication
[1:33:51.220 --> 1:33:56.580]  system is what they called it. That was the name of the first internet come up for by DARPA,
[1:33:56.580 --> 1:34:03.140]  the precursor to DARPA, the advanced weapons laboratories. And they said that everybody
[1:34:03.140 --> 1:34:06.580]  will have a little handheld computer as soon as they can miniaturize them and they'll be big
[1:34:06.580 --> 1:34:10.100]  central computers you plug into or they'll be wireless and it will track everything you go and
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:15.060]  where you go and what you do and then we'll have psychiatrists that run things like THX1138
[1:34:15.060 --> 1:34:20.420]  and psychologists that watch that and then have stimuli through the little handheld devices and
[1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:25.060]  the quote regional terminals and digital billboards and all these things they talked about that will
[1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:31.140]  then program you and control you to make you basically like a marionette. And that was the
[1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:35.060]  original design for the intergalactic communication system that's what it was actually called the
[1:34:35.060 --> 1:34:40.260]  first internet look it up yourself. So you can wonder where they got these ideas probably from
[1:34:40.260 --> 1:34:46.580]  not so friendly a little gremlin like creatures but continuing medicalization right here and
[1:34:46.580 --> 1:34:51.860]  this whole satanically inspired system is also called by the scientist and experts disease
[1:34:51.860 --> 1:34:57.300]  mongering. So go read the basic Wikipedia it's only about five pages long then read some of the
[1:34:57.300 --> 1:35:04.980]  footnotes like footnote 10 in here is a major study published at PubMed and the National
[1:35:04.980 --> 1:35:12.100]  Institutes of Health selling sickness to pharmacological industry and disease mongering.
[1:35:13.780 --> 1:35:24.100]  This was put out in 2002, 18, 19 years ago. Ray Malahan journalist, Island Heath, general
[1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:30.340]  practitioner David Henry professor of clinical pharmacology author information and it goes
[1:35:30.340 --> 1:35:34.180]  through all that and this is just one you can go read but it's a really good one that's a quick
[1:35:34.180 --> 1:35:41.060]  read it's got a bunch of footnotes about how they want to make all human activity unnatural so that
[1:35:41.060 --> 1:35:46.820]  you're captured by the medical system and basically become a synthetic android they control now you
[1:35:46.820 --> 1:35:52.740]  see that with the mRNA and how it is corporations are totally ruthless destroying medicine and
[1:35:52.740 --> 1:36:00.100]  creating a soulless system where the doctors and nurses just follow orders and how again they use
[1:36:00.100 --> 1:36:03.860]  the psychological problems of the public to then tell them they're victims and tell them
[1:36:03.860 --> 1:36:10.260]  they're sick and how they actually make you sick. So you should go read just this one paper
[1:36:12.580 --> 1:36:17.460]  ordinary processor elements and medical problems and then they use baldness as an example
[1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:21.140]  hundreds of millions of dollars are spent a year trying to quote cure baldness and there's no
[1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:30.420]  curing it it's designed to happen mild symptoms as portents of serious disease irritable bowel he
[1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:38.020]  goes on and on and here's the deal remember the Theranos company and the lady that bill gates
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:41.780]  financed who came out said I have a blood test for cancer I have a blood test for anything
[1:36:41.780 --> 1:36:47.860]  and it was all a fraud it's a PCR test just her own type and it was a total fraud and that's
[1:36:47.860 --> 1:36:52.900]  medicalization and then they could get you in for expensive cancer diagnostics heart diagnostics
[1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:56.980]  all this stuff because oh the Theranos system said and then they thought well the other medical
[1:36:56.980 --> 1:37:04.340]  companies will go along with this because they'll make so much money see how that operates and they
[1:37:04.340 --> 1:37:10.180]  talk a lot in here about how it's a problems that can never be fixed so you want to create something
[1:37:10.180 --> 1:37:15.060]  like oh the common cold there can never be a vaccine for it thousands of variants if anything
[1:37:15.060 --> 1:37:18.340]  you take a vaccine it will cause an autoimmune response in the future to the common cold and
[1:37:18.340 --> 1:37:23.620]  kill you like a Spanish flu did in 1917 because that was an autoimmune response to a summer virus
[1:37:25.060 --> 1:37:29.540]  and then they lay out how they need problems that never end and now that's in the news
[1:37:29.540 --> 1:37:33.860]  where they say oh it's actually 10 years we're going to be locked down now and oh the
[1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:39.060]  Bloomberg says the medical lockdown never ends this is a permanent pandemic because it's called
[1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:44.980]  medicalization medicalization medicalization it's fascinating it's their takeover plan it's how

[1:38:56.580 --> 1:39:01.300]  for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been
[1:39:01.300 --> 1:39:07.940]  trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on
[1:39:07.940 --> 1:39:14.420]  my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years
[1:39:14.420 --> 1:39:20.020]  that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible
[1:39:20.020 --> 1:39:27.140]  jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you
[1:39:27.140 --> 1:39:34.660]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:40.420]  and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's
[1:39:40.420 --> 1:39:44.980]  right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country
[1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:52.020]  no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country
[1:39:52.420 --> 1:40:00.420]  i knew trump was embattled i knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the
[1:40:00.420 --> 1:40:07.220]  enemy and a lot of people just couldn't believe it right oh no it's 3g chest 5g chest he's invincible
[1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:11.460]  and i understand why people are to believe that because this is scary what's going on
[1:40:11.460 --> 1:40:15.300]  the global government the new world order now that people hold up the fact that's real they
[1:40:15.300 --> 1:40:20.660]  won't somebody to come save them from well trump sure as hell tried my gosh look at how prescription
[1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:25.300]  drug prices just tripled for quadruple depending on the drug once by the sign that executive order
[1:40:25.860 --> 1:40:29.300]  we pay the most of anybody in the world that's just one case of hundreds of things
[1:40:29.940 --> 1:40:34.900]  that trump had reversed and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain energy cost everything
[1:40:34.900 --> 1:40:40.180]  else but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the senate where trump's own lawyers are
[1:40:40.180 --> 1:40:45.140]  attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engage all sorts of
[1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:51.140]  criminal activity because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep trump fought it but it's up to us
[1:40:51.140 --> 1:40:56.820]  to win it actually bought this it blocks uhf frequencies snowden and others taught us how

[1:44:33.220 --> 1:44:39.940]  i mean you notice their lobbying in mpr the new york times now today to deplatform us off amazon
[1:44:39.940 --> 1:44:48.500]  and to deplatform us off of uh ebay and they are also have an army of reporters we call that stalkers
[1:44:49.380 --> 1:44:55.700]  calling up employees offering them the money uh to just hate where do we have our stuff manufactured
[1:44:55.700 --> 1:44:59.540]  so i guess they can bomb threat them or what i mean they don't do it themselves they they give it
[1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:03.300]  to leftist groups on twitter but then send it out to millions of people and then they bomb threat
[1:45:03.300 --> 1:45:07.140]  that's what happens they they bomb threat everything else they come to your house you name it
[1:45:07.140 --> 1:45:11.060]  uh so it's a group of terrorists a group of malice terrorists and so what the news does the fake
[1:45:11.060 --> 1:45:16.180]  news is they they exterminate news they exterminate information they exterminate free speech we saw
[1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:22.260]  that polish lady that had the restaurant uh up in michigan and the attorney general said i had her
[1:45:22.260 --> 1:45:27.140]  arrested because she criticized me on tucker and tucker said you know that woman's dumb uh no tucker
[1:45:27.140 --> 1:45:34.660]  they've been told be brazen they've been told to start crushing just be authoritarian and and
[1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:43.860]  that's what they're doing so they are exercising power over us willfully in our faces so i really
[1:45:43.860 --> 1:45:47.540]  disagree with tucker but i disagree with him on that they've been given talking points they've
[1:45:47.540 --> 1:45:54.020]  been given orders and they've said yes we're authoritarians yes we're bad people and we are
[1:45:54.020 --> 1:45:58.660]  going to arrest you if we don't like you i mean i've met with globalists i've met with their
[1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:03.380]  minions and they'll point blank go uh you know off record conversations so i don't violate that
[1:46:03.380 --> 1:46:06.580]  they go yeah we're criminals yeah we're taking over we don't care we don't care what you do

[1:46:14.820 --> 1:46:20.340]  and the godfather movie and i said to them the godfather didn't traffic with kidnapped little
[1:46:20.340 --> 1:46:26.980]  children so i guess you're not like the godfather but see these people all think they're tough they
[1:46:26.980 --> 1:46:34.020]  all think they're gangsters they're protected by the fbi and uh they're busy selling the country off
[1:46:34.020 --> 1:46:38.020]  and we've put up with it so they have nothing but the stain and arrogance for us just like the
[1:46:38.020 --> 1:46:45.220]  communist chinese have to stay in arrogance for their puppet oh biden and their puppet kamala

[1:51:09.700 --> 1:51:15.140]  studied and read so much stuff that i'll routinely be studying some document oh i forgot i read this
[1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:21.060]  five years ago i mean i've just forgotten more knowledge than than most people will ever accrue
[1:51:21.060 --> 1:51:24.580]  and i'm not sitting there bragging about that i know a lot of men that know every baseball
[1:51:24.580 --> 1:51:29.780]  score and football score going back 100 years or whatever but they don't know the three branches
[1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:35.860]  of government i know a lot of women that are smart but they are mentally lazy and men of course as
[1:51:35.860 --> 1:51:40.740]  well where they don't care you should get a woman's attention and actually have a real conversation
[1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:45.860]  they're smart but they're usually off somewhere else just like men are and but men for other
[1:51:45.860 --> 1:51:50.660]  reasons women for other reasons and it's really a selfishness where people mentally don't really
[1:51:50.660 --> 1:51:57.220]  bother okay yeah there's a problem oh yeah sure and when you're like that you're unconscious
[1:51:57.220 --> 1:52:03.380]  and so a lot of people seem really stupid and it's not because they're stupid have you ever woke
[1:52:03.380 --> 1:52:08.180]  somebody up from a deep nap and for like five minutes they're dumb the general public is medically
[1:52:08.180 --> 1:52:13.700]  in a near trance state highly suggestible and it's really our job to get folks to realize they're
[1:52:13.700 --> 1:52:17.300]  in that state and instead of just giving them information more and more we've got to study

[1:55:29.220 --> 1:55:33.780]  are planning long term i'm going to cut really to the chase about what we're all facing and
[1:55:33.780 --> 1:55:38.500]  decisions we all have to make and then i wanted to get max keiser back on about the economy
[1:55:38.500 --> 1:55:45.860]  try some questions as suez canal crisis morphs into global food supply and energy supply crisis
[1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:55.540]  and so much more coming up but i wanted to air a short piece that we only aired once that i really
[1:55:55.540 --> 1:56:02.660]  think describes the place and the world that we are in right now
[1:56:06.260 --> 1:56:12.820]  and the fact that yes we know the left authoritarian yes we know the left are taking our free speech
[1:56:12.820 --> 1:56:19.940]  away yes we know that they don't have any morals and that means there's no bottom
[1:56:19.940 --> 1:56:25.540]  to these people it means there's no level to which they won't stupid i know you know that and i know i
[1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:34.820]  know that but that's that's what's happened and now the left is organizing school teachers and
[1:56:34.820 --> 1:56:39.060]  everybody into antifa and all these violent organizations and they believe it's their right
[1:56:39.060 --> 1:56:43.140]  to go out and stop speech and attack people because they're captain america and everybody they're
[1:56:43.140 --> 1:56:48.820]  fighting is that off headler and i know you as an audience know that but we have to just break
[1:56:48.820 --> 1:56:52.820]  with these people and not kiss their butt in any way and not try to argue with them like
[1:56:52.820 --> 1:56:56.820]  they're the moral authority and they're just misled they know they're scum they know they're
[1:56:56.820 --> 1:57:02.820]  bad people and they're making their move on civilization here's this quick piece
[1:57:05.300 --> 1:57:10.820]  well the bill of rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the
[1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:15.300]  left doesn't like at least in government but there's a new avenue for those who would like
[1:57:15.300 --> 1:57:21.060]  to censor what you say and think and that's corporations the left have wised up to this
[1:57:21.060 --> 1:57:27.300]  if you want to stop someone from telling the truth use companies to do it the social media
[1:57:27.300 --> 1:57:33.300]  giants and they are for many on the left the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them
[1:57:33.300 --> 1:57:37.300]  prevent them from speaking so far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression
[1:57:37.300 --> 1:57:42.100]  has been the radio show host alex jones there is a concerted effort by the democratic party
[1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:46.580]  by the democratic party and multinational corporations in big tech to silence conservative
[1:57:46.580 --> 1:57:51.460]  and nationalist and populist voices there's also guys on cnn that spend their whole day calling
[1:57:51.460 --> 1:57:57.220]  facebook and saying can you ban this person he may be america's best known conspiracy theorist
[1:57:57.220 --> 1:58:02.660]  but this week alex jones' content will be a little harder to find shame on the mainstream
[1:58:02.660 --> 1:58:07.060]  corporate media for not defending the first amendment but instead attack dogging calling
[1:58:07.060 --> 1:58:12.260]  for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech people know
[1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:20.900]  what's true they can smell it info wars the most banned network in the world in a free country
[1:58:20.900 --> 1:58:29.220]  everyone can be heard into talentarian societies only the powerful can be heard and again i'm
[1:58:29.220 --> 1:58:32.260]  gonna have that posted to band our video i know it's a little short minute and a half promo but
[1:58:32.260 --> 1:58:35.700]  that that that really says it all we should probably update it a few months longer because
[1:58:35.700 --> 1:58:39.860]  uh now they're moving on to say take tucker off the air and take him off satellites and
[1:58:39.860 --> 1:58:44.900]  here's what i mentioned earlier steve wasan as the article on info wars dot com new york times
[1:58:44.900 --> 1:58:49.300]  horrified that alex jones could still be found via google podcasts doesn't matter that they don't
[1:58:49.300 --> 1:58:54.020]  stream and it just lists thousands and thousands of podcasts and links where you can find it so
[1:58:54.020 --> 1:58:59.220]  what they're really calling for is delisting me off of google and that's the next frontier they've
[1:58:59.220 --> 1:59:05.140]  already done it with deceptive links and putting garbage on top and all the so-called little pack
[1:59:05.140 --> 1:59:10.660]  finders and arbiters of reality and fact checkers where they put blobs of bs you know above your
[1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:15.060]  statement saying it's not true but now they just want it completely and totally delisted where
[1:59:15.060 --> 1:59:19.220]  you can't search or find any of the content and then finally they're going to want to get rid of
[1:59:19.220 --> 1:59:24.900]  the urls themselves and that's the next move sorry started so be aware of that and start digging
[1:59:24.900 --> 1:59:30.020]  in and really valuing information more than ever because you'll see a direct correlation as more
[1:59:30.020 --> 1:59:36.020]  censorship happens your freedoms and your success and your um your your very way of life standard
[1:59:36.020 --> 1:59:43.220]  of living will go down the two are 100 connected as freedom goes so does wealth and prosperity
[1:59:43.780 --> 1:59:45.700]  they're like a horse and carriage in the red book
[1:59:49.220 --> 1:59:54.740]  blisters ask me all the time why do you have multiple multivitamins why do you have multiple
[1:59:54.740 --> 1:59:59.780]  high-quality iodines why do you do that because different strokes for different folks if we're
[1:59:59.780 --> 2:00:04.100]  talking to researchers and scientists and they say hey a lot of people love deep earth pure
[2:00:04.100 --> 2:00:08.340]  crystal iodine but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types
[2:00:08.340 --> 2:00:13.620]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine boom we did it it's popular it's x3 is it better than
[2:00:13.620 --> 2:00:18.740]  x2 you decide it's different strokes for different folks well now we have a compliment to knock out

[2:01:16.260 --> 2:01:26.820]  so i'm about to show you shocking footage as bad as pearl harbour as bad as 9-11
[2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:32.020]  parental discretion is advised if you're joining us here in the third hour
[2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:36.980]  you're lucky if you're a radio listener that you do not have to see what you are about to witness
[2:01:36.980 --> 2:01:42.020]  if you're a tv viewer again i would even advise that combat veterans cover your eyes right now
[2:01:42.020 --> 2:01:46.260]  you heard that the insurrection of the capital where a few hundred people went in and one defecated
[2:01:46.260 --> 2:01:51.860]  on the floors and some threw some papers around and then four citizens were killed a gun down
[2:01:51.860 --> 2:01:55.780]  throw out parapets a cop had a heart attack a few days later it died so it was called the most
[2:01:55.780 --> 2:02:00.660]  deadly attack in u.s history since pearl harbour or 9-11 by chucky schumer in the whole mainstream
[2:02:00.660 --> 2:02:07.140]  media so if anybody ever protests at the capital like code pink used to do or falls down the floor
[2:02:07.140 --> 2:02:13.060]  gets in an elevator or refuses to go anywhere uh it's an act of terrorism an act of insurrection
[2:02:13.060 --> 2:02:18.260]  we've seen hundreds of people charged who didn't even break anything just went in the capital
[2:02:18.260 --> 2:02:23.380]  or on the capital steps and there's all over the news that alex jones needs to be arrested
[2:02:23.380 --> 2:02:28.340]  so does roger stone roger stone wasn't even there but it doesn't matter like if you were even just
[2:02:28.340 --> 2:02:35.460]  gazed at the capital uh then you need to be said to a gulag and so here ladies and gentlemen
[2:02:35.460 --> 2:02:44.420]  one is the most shocking footage of a terror attack online with 9-11 and pearl harbour this is
[2:02:44.420 --> 2:02:48.340]  almost as bad as people walking between the velvet robes at the capital many of which have
[2:02:48.340 --> 2:02:54.020]  been charged state representative park canin the name sounds like a weapon that's characteristic
[2:02:54.020 --> 2:03:00.820]  threat right there arrested at state capital 11 news alive a democrat's representative was
[2:03:00.820 --> 2:03:05.540]  arrested after a disturbance will you change that to an insurrection excuse me a democrat's

[2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:29.540]  the same time governor brian kemp was giving remarks and signing a controversial republican
[2:03:29.540 --> 2:03:33.780]  election law to build the democrats can't stop ballot boxes and engage in massive fraud and
[2:03:33.780 --> 2:03:39.620]  violate state law and and and make up law of the governor himself uh and so the shock video shows her
[2:03:39.620 --> 2:03:45.300]  refusing to leave yelling and screaming uh and then her falling down which is uh the equivalent
[2:03:45.300 --> 2:03:51.060]  to dropping an atomic bomb and when you don't submit to the police it is well i mean it's worse

[2:13:27.820 --> 2:13:31.460]  We've got Max Kaiser for two segments, and then I'm going to hit, I hate talking like
[2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:33.860]  this, but I'm going to tell you where I really think this is all going to go, but they're
[2:13:33.860 --> 2:13:37.700]  going to launch it next, how it's all going to unfold, give you my breakdown in the last
[2:13:37.700 --> 2:13:41.580]  segment ahead of a great guest host that's about to be taking over in the fourth hour
[2:13:41.580 --> 2:13:43.540]  ahead of the war room with Owen Schreuer.
[2:13:43.540 --> 2:13:48.020]  But Max Kaiser came on your stay, and the interview got a lot of headlines, a lot of attention,
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:52.580]  and a lot of people had questions as well, got a lot of emails, a lot of calls saying,
[2:13:52.580 --> 2:13:56.220]  hey, have Max back and ask him about the Suez Canal.
[2:13:56.220 --> 2:14:00.340]  The crisis is now more for your global supply chain wrecking ball.
[2:14:00.340 --> 2:14:04.380]  People also said you predicted the casino gulag model 15 years ago here.
[2:14:04.380 --> 2:14:05.380]  That's now there.
[2:14:05.380 --> 2:14:06.380]  So people wanted to get you back on.
[2:14:06.380 --> 2:14:10.300]  We'll talk some about Bitcoin next segment, but to talk about big picture of the world
[2:14:10.300 --> 2:14:15.060]  economy, big moves, what you expect to happen next, because if you've been so accurate in
[2:14:15.060 --> 2:14:18.980]  the past in so many ways, especially on Bitcoin, well, people want to pick that brain about
[2:14:18.980 --> 2:14:23.340]  other systems like Biden, what's going to happen with him, what's going to happen with
[2:14:23.340 --> 2:14:24.340]  China.
[2:14:24.340 --> 2:14:25.340]  So there's a lot of questions there.
[2:14:25.340 --> 2:14:26.500]  What do you want to stab at first?
[2:14:26.500 --> 2:14:33.740]  Well, Alex, it's always about money printing and since really decades now, going all the
[2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:41.220]  way back to the 1970s, all of these countries have come to rely on money printing as a way
[2:14:41.220 --> 2:14:43.540]  to solve all their problems.
[2:14:43.540 --> 2:14:46.100]  And what happens is the currencies are debased.
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:53.300]  And then when the currencies are debased, there's no way to create any kind of economic
[2:14:53.300 --> 2:14:59.700]  friction that you can work to increase your wealth.
[2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:00.700]  And that leads to war.
[2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:06.340]  In other words, war is the inevitable outcome of printing fiat money because fiat money
[2:15:06.340 --> 2:15:12.220]  just debases everybody's currency until the point where you end up going to war.
[2:15:12.220 --> 2:15:14.140]  And this has been the case throughout history.
[2:15:14.140 --> 2:15:19.940]  And I think right now, we're on a war footing with the US, China, and other countries around
[2:15:19.940 --> 2:15:20.940]  the world.
[2:15:20.940 --> 2:15:23.420]  They're getting ready to go to war, which is unfortunate.
[2:15:23.420 --> 2:15:24.920]  It's totally avoidable.
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:28.980]  But it's the direct result of just printing money to death so that the value of the paper
[2:15:28.980 --> 2:15:31.620]  money is nothing.
[2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:35.540]  And people start to panic and they start to run out of supplies.
[2:15:35.540 --> 2:15:40.780]  I mean, the Suez Canal incident shows you how fragile the global supply chains are.
[2:15:40.780 --> 2:15:43.180]  Apparently, we're heading for another toilet paper shortage.
[2:15:43.180 --> 2:15:44.620]  It's one of the outcomes.
[2:15:44.620 --> 2:15:49.940]  All of the paper pulp from Brazil is now choked at that point in the Suez.
[2:15:49.940 --> 2:15:53.620]  But there are many, many choke points in the global supply chain right now.
[2:15:53.620 --> 2:16:01.700]  And they're all being kept afloat, if you will, using artificial means, artificial stimulus,
[2:16:01.700 --> 2:16:03.980]  money printing, accounting tricks.
[2:16:03.980 --> 2:16:05.820]  But that's all falling apart now.
[2:16:05.820 --> 2:16:11.140]  And because you can only use the defibrillator of fiat money so many times before you have
[2:16:11.140 --> 2:16:15.820]  to recognize that the patient is, in fact, dead.
[2:16:15.820 --> 2:16:20.900]  And now Klaus Schwab and others admit, the head of the IMF you talked about yesterday,
[2:16:20.900 --> 2:16:24.860]  that they've used the COVID lockdown to try to make us take more debt and put us into
[2:16:24.860 --> 2:16:25.860]  more debt.
[2:16:25.860 --> 2:16:30.380]  But the world is so flooded with all this fiat garbage that the end of the bubble is
[2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:32.380]  in sight.
[2:16:32.380 --> 2:16:33.380]  Any time frames on that?
[2:16:33.380 --> 2:16:35.260]  And what will it look like?
[2:16:35.260 --> 2:16:37.980]  What are the main trigger points you see detonating that bubble?
[2:16:37.980 --> 2:16:42.300]  Well, I know you want to talk about Bitcoin in the second half, but Bitcoin essentially
[2:16:42.300 --> 2:16:44.940]  is the only asset that's not in a bubble.
[2:16:44.940 --> 2:16:49.740]  And Bitcoin is the pin that's going to puncture the global debt bubble.
[2:16:49.740 --> 2:16:52.820]  And it's going to reveal all of the underlying fragility.
[2:16:52.820 --> 2:16:56.940]  And you said that to me 10 years ago, five years ago, two years ago, six months ago.
[2:16:56.940 --> 2:17:00.380]  They're now literally saying Bitcoin is going to cause a global depression.
[2:17:00.380 --> 2:17:04.140]  No, you're saying it's going to show the fraud and that it'll be the detonator.
[2:17:04.140 --> 2:17:06.060]  But then won't they try to blame it?
[2:17:06.060 --> 2:17:08.300]  Yeah, they will.
[2:17:08.300 --> 2:17:10.060]  But there's nothing they can do about it.
[2:17:10.060 --> 2:17:14.140]  They can pass any law they want to, but there's no way to enforce it.
[2:17:14.140 --> 2:17:18.260]  They can launch central bank digital currencies, but they don't compete with Bitcoin because
[2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:20.700]  they're centralized and Bitcoin is decentralized.
[2:17:20.700 --> 2:17:25.540]  I made the comparison yesterday to the PDP file swapping in the music industry.
[2:17:25.540 --> 2:17:28.740]  The music industry would have loved to shut it down, but they couldn't.
[2:17:28.740 --> 2:17:31.860]  What happened in the end is that the music industry had to change.
[2:17:31.860 --> 2:17:37.260]  Now we have subscriber and streaming services, but the old music industry before Napster
[2:17:37.260 --> 2:17:38.740]  died.
[2:17:38.740 --> 2:17:43.820]  Similar, the current central banking model and fiat money model, because of Bitcoin,
[2:17:43.820 --> 2:17:49.940]  will go the same way as the music industry did when a PDP encrypted network was introduced.
[2:17:49.940 --> 2:17:50.940]  They're going to die off.
[2:17:50.940 --> 2:17:53.180]  They're just not going to be around in 10 years time.
[2:17:53.180 --> 2:17:59.300]  Those central banks are going to be mere shadows of their former selves.
[2:17:59.300 --> 2:18:01.940]  What about the central banks that have mainly invested in China?
[2:18:01.940 --> 2:18:06.580]  Why does the head of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, why do they run America down, but always talk
[2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:07.580]  China up?
[2:18:07.580 --> 2:18:09.500]  Is that mainly just because they've invested there?
[2:18:09.500 --> 2:18:17.580]  Well, yeah, of course, you know, the global capital markets are invested in various assets
[2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:18.580]  around the world.
[2:18:18.580 --> 2:18:22.740]  But remember, all of those investments are made in fiat money.
[2:18:22.740 --> 2:18:24.580]  And so they're all at risk.
[2:18:24.580 --> 2:18:30.180]  More interestingly, Goldman Sachs is introducing a Bitcoin exchange traded fund.
[2:18:30.180 --> 2:18:35.060]  So is Fidelity and other major heavyweights on Wall Street.
[2:18:35.060 --> 2:18:39.900]  And it tells you how early we are with Bitcoin, because the heavyweights on Wall Street have
[2:18:39.900 --> 2:18:41.900]  yet to really jump into this market.
[2:18:41.900 --> 2:18:45.500]  Well, in fact, a couple of years ago, that JP Morgan and Chase and others, they were
[2:18:45.500 --> 2:18:46.500]  attacking Bitcoin.
[2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:48.340]  But as you said, now they're getting into it.
[2:18:48.340 --> 2:18:49.340]  Is that a capitulation?
[2:18:49.340 --> 2:18:50.340]  Or what's happened?
[2:18:50.340 --> 2:18:51.340]  Yeah.
[2:18:51.340 --> 2:18:53.420]  Yeah, that's a capitulation.
[2:18:53.420 --> 2:18:55.420]  That's what a capitulation looks like.
[2:18:55.420 --> 2:18:59.260]  And as I've been saying, Alex, the real story here is not that governments are going to
[2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:01.340]  try to ban it.
[2:19:01.340 --> 2:19:05.060]  It's going to be that governments are going to start to wholeheartedly embrace it as you
[2:19:05.060 --> 2:19:10.300]  get into what I call the global hash war, or the hash race, because a few countries
[2:19:10.300 --> 2:19:13.580]  right now are breaking away from US dollar global hegemony.
[2:19:13.580 --> 2:19:16.660]  They're buying, they're mining, they're hoarding Bitcoin.
[2:19:16.660 --> 2:19:20.300]  And so their currencies potentially could become the strongest currencies in the world.
[2:19:20.300 --> 2:19:24.580]  Well, certainly that's what China and others are doing, but they're going to try to create
[2:19:24.580 --> 2:19:28.220]  competing systems, but you think Bitcoin is already such the apex predator that it's
[2:19:28.220 --> 2:19:29.220]  not going to matter.
[2:19:29.220 --> 2:19:32.260]  It'll be a black hole that sucks in all the others.
[2:19:32.260 --> 2:19:34.780]  They're buying Bitcoin and they're mining Bitcoin.
[2:19:34.780 --> 2:19:39.500]  Like Venezuela, for example, they try to do a competing currency, a cryptocurrency, but
[2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:43.060]  they realize that for a couple of years that really the Bitcoin is the best game in town.
[2:19:43.060 --> 2:19:45.420]  So now they're going into Bitcoin.
[2:19:45.420 --> 2:19:46.420]  Same thing with Iran.
[2:19:46.420 --> 2:19:49.900]  Iran has got two or 3% of the global Bitcoin network.
[2:19:49.900 --> 2:19:55.420]  They potentially, if situation were to persist as it is right now, within five years, Iran
[2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:57.700]  would have the strongest currency in the world.
[2:19:57.700 --> 2:20:03.740]  So I don't think the US or Europe or Asia is going to let that happen.
[2:20:03.740 --> 2:20:07.300]  They're going to jump in with both feet and say, okay, we're going to start buying Bitcoin
[2:20:07.300 --> 2:20:08.500]  and buying Bitcoin.
[2:20:08.500 --> 2:20:11.620]  And that makes the price go up to 500,000 to a million.
[2:20:11.620 --> 2:20:14.420]  Well, sure, let them try to do it like prohibition, not only make it get bigger, we're going
[2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:17.740]  to go to break, come back and see where you see Bitcoin going, not just the big numbers
[2:20:17.740 --> 2:20:21.580]  you've been saying that have been coming through, but the technicals of why you say that.
[2:20:21.580 --> 2:20:25.540]  But I've gotten into Bitcoin, it's a great way to have an alternative to the system,
[2:20:25.540 --> 2:20:26.540]  the cleanest.
[2:20:26.540 --> 2:20:30.780]  Best way to do it is swanbitcoin.com, Ford slash Alex, that's where I've signed up.
[2:20:30.780 --> 2:20:31.780]  They're a sponsor now.
[2:20:31.780 --> 2:20:35.140]  And if you go sign up there, that supports the broadcast, you get all the same deals
[2:20:35.140 --> 2:20:39.140]  as the whole swan site, it's all the same interface, same dashboard, they've got a lot
[2:20:39.140 --> 2:20:44.180]  of great functions and features there so you can invest small or invest big.
[2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:47.100]  But whatever you do there, it supports the info war and we're going to continue to fight
[2:20:47.100 --> 2:20:48.580]  for freedom and justice.
[2:20:48.580 --> 2:20:51.580]  And so absolutely if I listen to him, all our problems will be solved.
[2:20:51.580 --> 2:20:54.940]  I listened 10 years ago, two years ago, I'm listening now because I need to find this
[2:20:54.940 --> 2:21:01.660]  operation plus this is a great system swanbitcoin.com, forward slash Alex, go there, sign up, it's
[2:21:01.660 --> 2:21:02.660]  free.

[2:21:22.140 --> 2:21:26.860]  forward slash Alex, swanbitcoin.com, forward slash Alex, very, very exciting.
[2:21:26.860 --> 2:21:30.700]  I know a lot of people, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands

[2:21:34.700 --> 2:21:38.940]  We're going to come back though and talk about the battle of global currencies, cryptocurrency,
[2:21:38.940 --> 2:21:47.020]  digital currencies and more with the guru of Bitcoin, Max Geyser.
[2:21:47.020 --> 2:21:52.820]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes info
[2:21:52.820 --> 2:21:53.820]  wars has had.
[2:21:53.820 --> 2:22:01.020]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together, but I'll tell you this, the
[2:22:01.020 --> 2:22:05.860]  technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent
[2:22:05.860 --> 2:22:11.140]  forms of media, they're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance, so now is
[2:22:11.140 --> 2:22:15.900]  the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate, everything
[2:22:15.900 --> 2:22:18.860]  you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:22:18.860 --> 2:22:23.860]  So it's now that your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those
[2:22:23.860 --> 2:22:30.620]  of us that they can, but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:30.620 --> 2:22:36.660]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:36.660 --> 2:22:40.980]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't
[2:22:40.980 --> 2:22:51.300]  come, so be the polar bears you are.
[2:22:51.300 --> 2:22:56.780]  Look I've proven that info wars information is some of the best in the world, it's just
[2:22:56.780 --> 2:23:01.420]  absolutely on target, the globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate,
[2:23:01.420 --> 2:23:03.140]  they want to keep you in the dark.
[2:23:03.140 --> 2:23:07.220]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F Kennedy
[2:23:07.220 --> 2:23:11.100]  was right, raising tide raises all ships.
[2:23:11.100 --> 2:23:16.940]  Now the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at info wars.com are

[2:23:52.020 --> 2:23:55.540]  Thank you for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[2:23:55.540 --> 2:24:01.580]  Yeah, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior
[2:24:01.580 --> 2:24:06.940]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[2:24:06.940 --> 2:24:12.020]  or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your X2 for the last couple of
[2:24:12.020 --> 2:24:15.620]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:24:15.620 --> 2:24:21.580]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought
[2:24:21.580 --> 2:24:25.460]  you know well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[2:24:25.460 --> 2:24:29.860]  situation but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately but you
[2:24:29.860 --> 2:24:36.100]  know over a period of time I started noticing okay you know this is a ticket, this is working,
[2:24:36.100 --> 2:24:42.580]  this is wonderful you know I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway
[2:24:42.580 --> 2:24:49.180]  it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:24:49.180 --> 2:24:54.300]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[2:24:54.300 --> 2:24:58.860]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[2:24:58.860 --> 2:25:04.660]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[2:25:04.660 --> 2:25:10.700]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[2:25:10.700 --> 2:25:15.420]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[2:25:15.420 --> 2:25:19.940]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[2:25:19.940 --> 2:25:25.180]  of your wife, your husband, the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[2:25:25.180 --> 2:25:30.100]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[2:25:30.100 --> 2:25:33.420]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:25:33.420 --> 2:25:37.580]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the
[2:25:37.580 --> 2:25:43.420]  system but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[2:25:43.420 --> 2:26:12.860]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:26:12.860 --> 2:26:17.620]  I know a lot of people who are into Bitcoin because it's cool, it's fun, they made a ton
[2:26:17.620 --> 2:26:18.620]  of money.
[2:26:18.620 --> 2:26:21.340]  I have so many listeners thank me, they say even though you were never really pushing
[2:26:21.340 --> 2:26:25.620]  Bitcoin, your guests were like Max Kaiser and you know I made $10 million doing, I mean
[2:26:25.620 --> 2:26:29.020]  I was so many people like I'll be in a restaurant, the restaurant owner comes over and buys me
[2:26:29.020 --> 2:26:33.460]  free dinner and says this whole restaurant, everything, I was working as a chef eight
[2:26:33.460 --> 2:26:36.700]  years ago and then I heard Max Kaiser on your show and I went and did it and it's been great
[2:26:36.700 --> 2:26:40.740]  and I've helped all these people and it's just, the amount of testimonials I've gotten,
[2:26:40.740 --> 2:26:45.420]  the reason I never got into it was I knew it was Wild Wild West, I knew there was all
[2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:49.580]  sorts of people, not Bitcoin itself but all sorts of scams and then all these new coins
[2:26:49.580 --> 2:26:53.980]  came out about when I was finally going to get into it and I talked to Max and I said
[2:26:53.980 --> 2:26:54.980]  will you lead me through this?
[2:26:54.980 --> 2:26:58.500]  He said yeah I'll come to town, he came here for a couple of days, showed me, he said go
[2:26:58.500 --> 2:27:03.420]  to swan Bitcoin, you know it's not underground, it's just like a bank, it's all secure, it's
[2:27:03.420 --> 2:27:07.820]  able to help the people, they're great, they're the original OGs, they've been in it since
[2:27:07.820 --> 2:27:12.340]  the start and then I just never did it because I was busy and then I'm like oh my gosh, I
[2:27:12.340 --> 2:27:16.940]  mean it's gone up from, you know, it's went then from like 2000 to 60,000, I mean just
[2:27:16.940 --> 2:27:22.140]  think of that if I'd have done that then and so no more because I was already sold then
[2:27:22.140 --> 2:27:26.620]  but the fact that it's professional, some people go well I'm going down to a payday
[2:27:26.620 --> 2:27:29.460]  long place and get some Bitcoin, great do that if you want and then that's underground
[2:27:29.460 --> 2:27:34.420]  totally, I'm doing this all as they say legit because I run a very legit operation, if I
[2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:37.100]  have a crooked toenail they're going to put me in prison folks, you see that all over
[2:27:37.100 --> 2:27:41.620]  the news, so this is so legit, this is the biggest, this is the best, I'm bringing it
[2:27:41.620 --> 2:27:46.300]  to you, it's like the storeable food company we have, only 14 years old, two years into
[2:27:46.300 --> 2:27:49.300]  it I heard they were the best, they were good sponsors, everybody loved it, they had good
[2:27:49.300 --> 2:27:54.180]  price, 10 years later they're the biggest food company in North America, probably the
[2:27:54.180 --> 2:27:58.140]  world, storeable food because of the quality, they got one of the biggest warehouses I've
[2:27:58.140 --> 2:28:03.140]  ever heard of now and that's my Patriot supply, all available at InfoWarsTour.com, so I really
[2:28:03.140 --> 2:28:07.780]  want to steer you towards something good, I want to treat you like I'm treated, I am
[2:28:07.780 --> 2:28:11.300]  just excited, they may crash Bitcoin but I believe it's just going to go back up, it
[2:28:11.300 --> 2:28:15.940]  doesn't matter, they don't want to send it, it's the proven apex predator, 95% of all
[2:28:15.940 --> 2:28:21.780]  the cryptocurrencies and digital is it, that's not going away and I agree with Max now, he's
[2:28:21.780 --> 2:28:28.940]  right, I believe it's just begun, swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex, swanbitcoin.com forward
[2:28:28.940 --> 2:28:34.700]  slash Alex to get 10 free dollars of a Bitcoin, it's free but yeah, then if you want to go
[2:28:34.700 --> 2:28:40.100]  and get deeper and buy Bitcoin and put it into this system then you've got to sign up
[2:28:40.100 --> 2:28:44.340]  and prove your ID and I did that myself with my driver's license and my info and the code
[2:28:44.340 --> 2:28:48.940]  I gave them because this is setting up a digital bank account, this is extremely legitimate
[2:28:48.940 --> 2:28:52.220]  and then this gives you something else you can operate with when all the big credit card
[2:28:52.220 --> 2:28:56.900]  companies in PayPal are banning Christians, conservatives, Trump, us, I'm also being forced
[2:28:56.900 --> 2:29:00.020]  into this by necessity because of the incredible tyranny.
[2:29:00.020 --> 2:29:04.060]  I know I'm ranting Max, I got you here, get more into the history of Bitcoin and how you've
[2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:07.140]  been able to accurately predict it and where you think it's going.
[2:29:07.140 --> 2:29:13.500]  Right, well the history goes back 20 years or more really, it's always been the goal
[2:29:13.500 --> 2:29:18.860]  for what are called the cipher punks, you know, computer engineers and hackers that try to
[2:29:18.860 --> 2:29:26.620]  create digital money that would be decentralized, ultimately decentralized, the problem with
[2:29:26.620 --> 2:29:31.980]  all the schemes beforehand and I had this myself when I created the Hollywood dollar
[2:29:31.980 --> 2:29:37.660]  and the patent that I have going back to the 1990s is that you have the situation of it's
[2:29:37.660 --> 2:29:43.940]  all being centralized and that doesn't lend itself to being a competitor to fiat money
[2:29:43.940 --> 2:29:50.220]  but when you have a decentralized hard money like Bitcoin, it does become a competitor
[2:29:50.220 --> 2:29:57.380]  to fiat money and to gold and the reason is that it's indestructible, it's decentralized
[2:29:57.380 --> 2:30:07.060]  and that it's replicated on servers all over the world and there is no way that you can
[2:30:07.060 --> 2:30:10.580]  hack in or break into or change this system.
[2:30:10.580 --> 2:30:16.380]  There's a fantastic egalitarianism if you will in that even if you have a 50 million
[2:30:16.380 --> 2:30:21.620]  dollars worth of Bitcoin, you still can't change the network, you can't change the protocol,
[2:30:21.620 --> 2:30:27.540]  you can't change the emission schedule at points every 10 minutes.
[2:30:27.540 --> 2:30:31.100]  From the beginning it's been the dominant one and nothing else can rival it because
[2:30:31.100 --> 2:30:32.100]  it was done so well.
[2:30:32.100 --> 2:30:34.140]  I mean why have the others been able to rival it?
[2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:37.460]  Not done as well, didn't have the beginners momentum, there's clearly now this has been
[2:30:37.460 --> 2:30:38.460]  globally adopted.
[2:30:38.460 --> 2:30:43.060]  I mean you see the collapse of resistance, the capitulation, I'm capitulating.
[2:30:43.060 --> 2:30:49.660]  Right, the other coins just failed, I mean after Bitcoin came out it was a perfect mix
[2:30:49.660 --> 2:30:54.620]  of available technologies that created the Bitcoin protocol that does exactly what it
[2:30:54.620 --> 2:31:00.180]  says it's trying to do and that is to put gold out of business as a better form of
[2:31:00.180 --> 2:31:05.060]  gold, a digital gold and then of course there were thousands of competitors like Ethereum
[2:31:05.060 --> 2:31:11.540]  and Bcash and Satoshi Vision and Tron and just thousands of them and they've all failed
[2:31:11.540 --> 2:31:14.420]  essentially and because there's no need for them.
[2:31:14.420 --> 2:31:18.740]  I believe you five years ago, three years ago you said they're all going to fail but
[2:31:18.740 --> 2:31:19.740]  now you're proving right again.
[2:31:19.740 --> 2:31:24.940]  I'm not kissing your butt, it's true, how the hell are you so right about this?
[2:31:24.940 --> 2:31:28.980]  Because I've been studying this for decades, all the way back to my Wall Street career
[2:31:28.980 --> 2:31:34.540]  I was always interested in virtual currencies, market making, economics, finance.
[2:31:34.540 --> 2:31:40.820]  Then I ran a technology company in Los Angeles and then I became a financial journalist and
[2:31:40.820 --> 2:31:47.180]  then when I discovered Bitcoin in 2011 along with Stacey Herbert it immediately clicked.
[2:31:47.180 --> 2:31:52.380]  I just saw immediately how this fit into the timeline and also it fits perfectly in with
[2:31:52.380 --> 2:31:54.620]  the Occupy Wall Street movement.
[2:31:54.620 --> 2:32:00.820]  Bitcoin is a protest movement and the idea is that the people behind Bitcoin and the
[2:32:00.820 --> 2:32:08.820]  Cypherpunks who gave us a pretty good encryption and were able to release encrypted messaging
[2:32:08.820 --> 2:32:14.900]  into the wild that was formally behind the firewall of the military industrial complex.
[2:32:14.900 --> 2:32:20.100]  The same revolutionaries have just continued to keep pioneering since PK Dick gave them
[2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:22.940]  their name 40 years ago.
[2:32:22.940 --> 2:32:28.180]  Right, so it's just part of the same revolution of giving people the ability to have uncensored
[2:32:28.180 --> 2:32:31.860]  communication and to separate state from money.
[2:32:31.860 --> 2:32:34.780]  This is one of the most profound implications of Bitcoin.
[2:32:34.780 --> 2:32:38.780]  Never before in history have we been able to separate state from money.
[2:32:38.780 --> 2:32:41.820]  Every single form of money going back hundreds of years, thousands of years.
[2:32:41.820 --> 2:32:47.500]  Back to the Talisman, the British and back to the emperors and the pharaohs of ancient
[2:32:47.500 --> 2:32:48.500]  Egypt.
[2:32:48.500 --> 2:32:50.780]  It's always been the crown.
[2:32:50.780 --> 2:32:53.860]  The state or the crown issues the money.
[2:32:53.860 --> 2:32:58.620]  It's been speculated by people like Frederick Hayek that you could have private money that
[2:32:58.620 --> 2:33:03.060]  was separate from the state, but he didn't see how it could happen unless it was a quirk,
[2:33:03.060 --> 2:33:05.460]  almost an accidental occurrence.
[2:33:05.460 --> 2:33:08.380]  And exactly this is what happened in 2009.
[2:33:08.380 --> 2:33:12.580]  It's almost a quirky little occurrence that Bitcoin was released into the internet and
[2:33:12.580 --> 2:33:15.980]  now we do have separation of state and money.
[2:33:15.980 --> 2:33:22.300]  And that's why the state is becoming quite nervous because if all the capital ends up
[2:33:22.300 --> 2:33:27.340]  moving into Bitcoin like it is and the market capitalization goes from $1 trillion to $100
[2:33:27.340 --> 2:33:32.820]  trillion to $400 trillion, that means that this nation state, as we know it, is going
[2:33:32.820 --> 2:33:34.620]  to go out of business.
[2:33:34.620 --> 2:33:38.740]  The central banks are going to go out of business and we're entering into a new era, kind of
[2:33:38.740 --> 2:33:39.740]  a renaissance 2.0.
[2:33:39.740 --> 2:33:44.660]  Is that why your view on the whole cup of deal, obviously a giant evil power grab, that's
[2:33:44.660 --> 2:33:48.660]  their attempt to stay in control.
[2:33:48.660 --> 2:33:54.780]  Everyone always seeks more power and the state always seeks to expand the state and that's
[2:33:54.780 --> 2:33:58.500]  the nature of the beast.
[2:33:58.500 --> 2:34:05.340]  But they are up against an impregnable foe with Bitcoin now and they're just now starting
[2:34:05.340 --> 2:34:11.540]  to come to terms with the fact that everyone will capitulate eventually, Alex, as you say,
[2:34:11.540 --> 2:34:13.700]  you've capitulated here.
[2:34:13.700 --> 2:34:18.940]  But everybody, everyone will capitulate eventually and it's just a matter of what price they
[2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:19.940]  capitulate.
[2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:26.020]  Let me ask you this, is there a threat from quantum computing to the encryption of Bitcoin?
[2:34:26.020 --> 2:34:33.020]  The algorithms and the hashing algorithms that protect the network are in such an advanced
[2:34:33.020 --> 2:34:42.340]  state that any quantum computing that, certainly nothing existing now, if you project out 5,
[2:34:42.340 --> 2:34:48.140]  in 15 years, you still, you don't see anything on the horizon on the quantum computer side
[2:34:48.140 --> 2:34:50.420]  that would be a threat.
[2:34:50.420 --> 2:34:56.980]  And there are folks working on the protocol every single day who are fine tuning the protocol
[2:34:56.980 --> 2:35:01.260]  and releasing improvements to the protocol.
[2:35:01.260 --> 2:35:09.460]  And if there was, say, a five-year advanced suspicion or thought that some kind of quantum
[2:35:09.460 --> 2:35:15.740]  attack were to occur, there's ample time to tweak and do what needs to be done.
[2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:16.740]  Everyone has an incentive.
[2:35:16.740 --> 2:35:20.120]  Well, first we know the credit cards and the cash and all that's already infiltrated
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:21.120]  and overthrown.
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:23.420]  So all it's like open with the barn doors.
[2:35:23.420 --> 2:35:27.540]  Max Kaiser, thank you so much, swanbitcoin.com, forward slash Alex, though there are 10 free
[2:35:27.540 --> 2:35:32.460]  dollars of Bitcoins in the place to invest in Bitcoin in my view, according to Max Kaiser,
[2:35:32.460 --> 2:35:35.700]  who is the guru, swanbitcoin.com, forward slash Alex.
[2:35:35.700 --> 2:35:37.340]  Max, join us again very, very soon.
[2:35:37.340 --> 2:35:38.340]  Thank you.
[2:35:38.340 --> 2:35:39.340]  Have a great weekend.
[2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:40.340]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:35:40.340 --> 2:35:41.340]  Thanks.
[2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:42.340]  All right, final segment.
[2:35:42.340 --> 2:35:43.340]  I'm going to look at the big global stakeover plan.
[2:35:43.340 --> 2:35:44.340]  I'll stop it.
[2:35:44.340 --> 2:35:46.740]  And then we've got another special guesthouse coming up.
[2:35:46.740 --> 2:35:54.860]  Gimrex Essentials is all-natural, all-organic, high-end quality, clean, self-care products.
[2:35:54.860 --> 2:36:02.620]  And they are 50% off right now at infowarstore.com with free shipping for a limited time.
[2:36:02.620 --> 2:36:09.900]  That is the three essential oil, all-natural hand sanitizers, that's all of these high-end
[2:36:09.900 --> 2:36:15.380]  super pure quality essential oils in basically every popular set that's out there.
[2:36:15.380 --> 2:36:18.940]  And then of course we have the natural shampoo, organic.
[2:36:18.940 --> 2:36:24.940]  We also have the body wash, it's all there, and our best-selling organic deodorant.
[2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:30.860]  From Gimrex Essentials, 50% off and free shipping, part of our big blowout sale that's
[2:36:30.860 --> 2:36:32.260]  taking place right now.
[2:36:32.260 --> 2:36:39.580]  We also have Brainforce Plus, Neutropic Back-and-Stop, it's 50% off as well at infowarstore.com.
[2:36:39.580 --> 2:36:47.300]  50% off and free shipping right now at infowarstore.com on these select items.
[2:36:47.300 --> 2:36:54.260]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[2:36:54.260 --> 2:36:55.580]  that this is all a test.
[2:36:55.580 --> 2:37:01.580]  This experience, this whiff on this planet is a reckoning.
[2:37:01.580 --> 2:37:06.500]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so that we can
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:10.740]  decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to, and it really
[2:37:10.740 --> 2:37:15.460]  does come down to that, so as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all
[2:37:15.460 --> 2:37:20.500]  the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[2:37:20.500 --> 2:37:24.100]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[2:37:24.100 --> 2:37:29.740]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[2:37:29.740 --> 2:37:33.900]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[2:37:33.900 --> 2:37:39.180]  D.C., and Fauci, and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[2:37:39.180 --> 2:37:43.180]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[2:37:43.180 --> 2:37:48.140]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[2:37:48.140 --> 2:37:51.580]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[2:37:51.580 --> 2:37:56.980]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[2:37:56.980 --> 2:37:58.700]  down to nothing.
[2:37:58.700 --> 2:38:03.940]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team, you're about
[2:38:03.940 --> 2:38:06.660]  to find out how pathetic you are.
[2:38:06.660 --> 2:38:13.860]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[2:38:13.860 --> 2:38:18.980]  The enemy is about to expose itself, the enemy can't help itself.
[2:38:18.980 --> 2:38:23.060]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[2:38:23.060 --> 2:38:28.660]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should, but once
[2:38:28.660 --> 2:38:34.220]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[2:38:34.220 --> 2:38:38.540]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[2:38:38.540 --> 2:38:42.580]  So prepare yourselves, America, you're going under a judge but just like all the children
[2:38:42.580 --> 2:38:48.220]  that were aborted, this is the truth, this is the info war.
[2:38:48.220 --> 2:38:53.140]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment, cell phones are
[2:38:53.140 --> 2:38:58.620]  an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations
[2:38:58.620 --> 2:39:03.820]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially, are using this to
[2:39:03.820 --> 2:39:08.900]  steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:13.780]  up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[2:39:13.780 --> 2:39:14.780]  mass movements.
[2:39:14.780 --> 2:39:22.180]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover, in their own
[2:39:22.180 --> 2:39:23.180]  words they admit it.
[2:39:23.180 --> 2:39:27.180]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and blockets and things like that for more than
[2:39:27.180 --> 2:39:28.180]  a decade.
[2:39:28.180 --> 2:39:31.660]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[2:39:31.660 --> 2:39:36.620]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great, and it just gives you that security to have
[2:39:36.620 --> 2:39:41.700]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[2:39:41.700 --> 2:39:43.900]  brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[2:39:43.900 --> 2:40:11.540]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:40:11.540 --> 2:40:16.900]  All right, it's the final segment here ladies and gentlemen of the three hours I'm hosting,
[2:40:16.900 --> 2:40:22.420]  then Stu Peters, former bounty hunter, great talk show host, really smart fella, he is
[2:40:22.420 --> 2:40:29.500]  going to be taking over in the fourth hour and has quite the transmission lined up for
[2:40:29.500 --> 2:40:30.500]  you.
[2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:33.740]  I am coming back here tomorrow and I don't know if it's going to be taped to air or it's
[2:40:33.740 --> 2:40:39.100]  going to be live at 3pm, but one way or another, we're going to have a special tape show that
[2:40:39.100 --> 2:40:42.380]  I'll tape right beforehand or I'll go live, I'm on the side after the show today with
[2:40:42.380 --> 2:40:43.380]  the crew.
[2:40:43.380 --> 2:40:49.140]  But 3pm tomorrow central, 4pm Eastern, we're going to do another big commercial free show
[2:40:49.140 --> 2:40:50.140]  up.
[2:40:50.140 --> 2:40:52.580]  I'm thinking about going live so I can take an hour of calls and then we can get a lot
[2:40:52.580 --> 2:40:57.060]  more calls on if we don't have the breaks, obviously for obvious reasons.
[2:40:57.060 --> 2:41:01.780]  So please look for that tomorrow, very appreciative of the crew coming in and doing that as well.
[2:41:01.780 --> 2:41:06.980]  But the way the world is now, the massive censorship, every day I'm still on air is precious
[2:41:06.980 --> 2:41:10.740]  and we have just got to fight and expose these things and get these things out.
[2:41:10.740 --> 2:41:16.500]  You know what I say, I want to break down what the world is going to look like if we
[2:41:16.500 --> 2:41:21.020]  don't stop this, it's because I had a caller, I guess on Tuesday, that we ran up against
[2:41:21.020 --> 2:41:25.420]  the break at the end of the show and he's like, tell me what's coming next.
[2:41:25.420 --> 2:41:29.540]  Well, it's kind of like the Mississippi River when you fly over an airplane, you see all
[2:41:29.540 --> 2:41:32.700]  the times it's changed its path.
[2:41:32.700 --> 2:41:37.140]  You can see it like five miles this way, 10 miles that way, where a thousand years ago,
[2:41:37.140 --> 2:41:40.420]  500 years ago, it had a different course and it changes.
[2:41:40.420 --> 2:41:46.380]  But you know it's flowing from the north to the south out to the Gulf of Mexico.
[2:41:46.380 --> 2:41:50.340]  And so you know the direction, you know what it is, you know what's in it.
[2:41:50.340 --> 2:41:52.380]  And it's the same thing with the globalist.
[2:41:52.380 --> 2:42:00.020]  They've got a trajectory, they've got a direction they're leading us, which is horrible, which
[2:42:00.020 --> 2:42:02.420]  is frightening, which isn't terrible.
[2:42:02.420 --> 2:42:06.180]  And where they told us, you're not going to leave your house unless we authorize you
[2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:10.700]  to and you'll be tracked by a smart computer and you'll be given all these inoculations
[2:42:10.700 --> 2:42:11.700]  to sterilize you.
[2:42:11.700 --> 2:42:17.620]  I mean Bertrand Russell in the 30s theorized what we see today.
[2:42:17.620 --> 2:42:22.020]  By the 60s, DARPA had developed the actual plan.
[2:42:22.020 --> 2:42:26.060]  And just today, I told you about the intergalactic communication system.
[2:42:26.060 --> 2:42:29.940]  That's not something that science fiction movie to talk to aliens, it's what they call it,
[2:42:29.940 --> 2:42:30.940]  the Internet.
[2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:34.780]  It's what all of this is, and it's a big plan.
[2:42:34.780 --> 2:42:41.860]  And as the late great comedian once said, it's a big plan and we ain't in it.
[2:42:41.860 --> 2:42:44.580]  It's a big club and we ain't in it.
[2:42:44.580 --> 2:42:48.340]  So you already see what the plan is.
[2:42:48.340 --> 2:42:51.820]  It's endless lockdowns, it's endless lies, it's common sense tournaments head.
[2:42:51.820 --> 2:42:55.100]  It's oh, you got to have a vaccine to travel or have a life, but now that's not enough.
[2:42:55.100 --> 2:42:59.460]  And okay, now you got to do any acts killing a bunch of people just accepted knowing our
[2:42:59.460 --> 2:43:00.460]  own laziness.
[2:43:00.460 --> 2:43:01.460]  Okay, I'll take the shot.
[2:43:01.460 --> 2:43:02.460]  I'll do whatever.
[2:43:02.460 --> 2:43:04.660]  Just let me go out and do what I want again.
[2:43:04.660 --> 2:43:10.980]  But notice you take the shot still, you don't get what they promised you because they are
[2:43:10.980 --> 2:43:11.980]  sucking you in.
[2:43:11.980 --> 2:43:16.460]  Yeah, it was George Carlin, the famous who said it's a big club and we ain't in it.
[2:43:16.460 --> 2:43:21.060]  So you ask what the future is, it's the same thing that Winston Smith asked O'Brien while
[2:43:21.060 --> 2:43:25.420]  he's torturing him in the fictional 1984.
[2:43:25.420 --> 2:43:30.540]  And he said, do you want to see a vision of the future Winston?
[2:43:30.540 --> 2:43:35.380]  He says it's a boot stomping on the human face forever.
[2:43:35.380 --> 2:43:39.500]  We like to kill people, we like to hurt people, we like to trample, we like to be trampled
[2:43:39.500 --> 2:43:40.500]  upon.
[2:43:40.500 --> 2:43:46.380]  We're building a society uglier, short-lived, stunted, where betrayal is the new love, where
[2:43:46.380 --> 2:43:53.580]  agony is the new pleasure, you understand now Winston?
[2:43:53.580 --> 2:43:58.620]  And the most important thing is Winston, when I'm done torturing you, you won't know who
[2:43:58.620 --> 2:44:01.860]  you are anymore and I'll have your soul.
[2:44:01.860 --> 2:44:04.500]  And then you'll never even know when we walk up behind you and shoot you in the back of
[2:44:04.500 --> 2:44:10.740]  the head and then burn your body and shoot your ashes into the atmosphere.
[2:44:10.740 --> 2:44:17.340]  No one will ever have known you existed because we're all about sorrow and pain and loneliness
[2:44:17.340 --> 2:44:23.420]  and emptiness.
[2:44:23.420 --> 2:44:26.340]  And that's what this is.
[2:44:26.340 --> 2:44:27.820]  And you say, why would they do that?
[2:44:27.820 --> 2:44:33.500]  Well, you should read an article, if you want to know the future, and then read this article
[2:44:33.500 --> 2:44:37.100]  and then project that onto Bill Gates and onto the Pentagon and onto the whole system
[2:44:37.100 --> 2:44:39.540]  and that's what you're going to get.
[2:44:39.540 --> 2:44:44.180]  John Wayne Gacy liked the power of death, retired detective reveals in documentary.
[2:44:44.180 --> 2:44:48.180]  It made him feel like a god.
[2:44:48.180 --> 2:44:56.640]  Raphael Tovair believes John Wayne Gacy is responsible for killing more victims than
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:44:58.140]  33 we know of today.
[2:44:58.140 --> 2:45:03.820]  One of the most notorious killer killers in America is the 75 new true crime documentary
[2:45:03.820 --> 2:45:08.540]  John Wayne Gacy, Devil in Disguise, now streaming on the PCOT platform.
[2:45:08.540 --> 2:45:13.020]  The show follows how the Chicago native was able to manipulate and lure young men and
[2:45:13.020 --> 2:45:15.900]  boys before brutally murdering them.
[2:45:15.900 --> 2:45:19.780]  The documentary features rare sit-downs with investigators, counter murders as well as
[2:45:19.780 --> 2:45:23.260]  one of Gacy's closest confidants and his ex, second ex-wife.
[2:45:23.260 --> 2:45:33.660]  In addition, it includes a 3.5 hour rare prison interview with the man before his 94 execution
[2:45:33.660 --> 2:45:35.180]  at 52.
[2:45:35.180 --> 2:45:40.260]  Now, why, by the way, did all these women want him once he was in prison?
[2:45:40.260 --> 2:45:43.620]  They were lined up to go have sex with him because they like demons.
[2:45:43.620 --> 2:45:44.620]  They like devils.
[2:45:44.620 --> 2:45:48.260]  All these women bring their children to drag queen story time.
[2:45:48.260 --> 2:45:52.900]  Where convicted pedophiles have erections and their boys and girls bounce as the old
[2:45:52.900 --> 2:45:55.100]  women squeal and get off.
[2:45:55.100 --> 2:45:57.100]  These women are demonic.
[2:45:57.100 --> 2:45:59.940]  We know the men are bad, but the women are just as sick.
[2:45:59.940 --> 2:46:03.620]  They're the type that would bring their child to a human sacrifice in all the ancient cultures.
[2:46:03.620 --> 2:46:10.740]  It's the same thing with people taking their kids to be inoculated.
[2:46:10.740 --> 2:46:15.340]  They know good and well, it's evil, but there's a demonic thing in them that makes them get
[2:46:15.340 --> 2:46:24.620]  excited like that, roomful of 100 women whenever the prime minister of Canada says, I want
[2:46:24.620 --> 2:46:25.620]  dictatorship.
[2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:26.780]  I like China's dictatorship.
[2:46:26.780 --> 2:46:30.500]  The women start really getting sexually excited.
[2:46:30.500 --> 2:46:31.500]  That's powerful.
[2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:34.940]  That's manly, a dictatorship, but they just, because they're part of it.
[2:46:34.940 --> 2:46:39.900]  You see, they're there with the young devil credo and he's up there telling them how much
[2:46:39.900 --> 2:46:45.220]  fun it is and how he's going to stick his pitchfork in them because these are weak,
[2:46:45.220 --> 2:46:48.780]  soft, stupid people that were brought up against real evil.
[2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:53.660]  It's thrilling to them, like being at the edge of a cliff, and they want to take us
[2:46:53.660 --> 2:46:57.820]  there with them.
[2:46:57.820 --> 2:47:02.940]  I remember going to the Capitol like six years ago, and I'd heard about this when I actually
[2:47:02.940 --> 2:47:03.940]  witnessed it.
[2:47:03.940 --> 2:47:08.500]  It was women in business suits looking at me like a demon, and we were there for an
[2:47:08.500 --> 2:47:12.180]  anti-abortion bill, and I remember the women were like all high, and they just came in
[2:47:12.180 --> 2:47:18.460]  like, I say China, kill my baby, we're going to kill him, and there's video of this, and
[2:47:18.460 --> 2:47:21.660]  you think they're like joking, trying to shock you, no, no, no.
[2:47:21.660 --> 2:47:26.180]  I've caught these women having little satanic parties at the Capitol, well, they don't even
[2:47:26.180 --> 2:47:30.220]  know you're watching them, and these aren't women that go to satanic events.
[2:47:30.220 --> 2:47:35.180]  They are so open, and there's no man in their life, and they were so raised to just be basically
[2:47:35.180 --> 2:47:40.260]  almost like a clairvoyant, they're just interfacing with it, and it's rapturous.
[2:47:40.260 --> 2:47:44.780]  They reported in the Roman histories, when they would go look at different groups they
[2:47:44.780 --> 2:47:49.300]  conquered when they would ban human sacrifice, they did it as men killing each other gladiators,
[2:47:49.300 --> 2:47:52.780]  but they looked down during the rise of the Roman Empire badly on killing children and
[2:47:52.780 --> 2:47:57.060]  women, later they did it themselves, and they said that people would go into a frenzy when
[2:47:57.060 --> 2:48:01.220]  they would eat their children, cut them up, but their favorite thing would be to have
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:06.420]  like a big grill, and then you would just throw the baby on the grill, and it would start
[2:48:06.420 --> 2:48:11.220]  popping and hissing and splattering, and then the priest would eat the baby, and that's
[2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:17.020]  don't not give your children to the fires of Moloch, the bull, who also sometimes was
[2:48:17.020 --> 2:48:24.300]  an owl, and so if you want to know the future, the future is the past.
[2:48:24.300 --> 2:48:30.860]  Humans repeat the same activities over and over again, and we go through cycles of corruption,
[2:48:30.860 --> 2:48:35.340]  and decadence, pure evil, and collapse, and then rebirths and awakening in a stoic society
[2:48:35.340 --> 2:48:41.580]  of strength and honor and justice, and then incredible prosperity, and then the corruption
[2:48:41.580 --> 2:48:48.340]  sets in yet again, and so we are now entering the depths of the decadent cycle, and it may
[2:48:48.340 --> 2:48:53.780]  last five years, it may last a hundred, but it is going to get the most nightmarish and
[2:48:53.780 --> 2:49:01.700]  the most poisoned, and the most sickening, and dangerous, and stinking that you could
[2:49:01.700 --> 2:49:03.460]  ever imagine.
[2:49:03.460 --> 2:49:07.660]  So you think the Aztecs were bad, you think the Babylonians were bad, you think John Wayne
[2:49:07.660 --> 2:49:14.940]  Gacy's bad, they're par for the course, because what did he say?
[2:49:14.940 --> 2:49:20.780]  The power of death made him feel like a god, he only felt alive when there was somebody
[2:49:20.780 --> 2:49:26.940]  begging for their life, chained down that he could torture, and they're all the same,
[2:49:26.940 --> 2:49:31.580]  but he doesn't operate at a smart level, even though he was involved at the Rotary Club
[2:49:31.580 --> 2:49:37.980]  and the top guy, getting money raised for all the stuff.
[2:49:37.980 --> 2:49:44.060]  He's a low level operator, he's about a millimeter tall, and Bill Gates is a thousand feet tall,
[2:49:44.060 --> 2:49:48.780]  on the scale of murder and death, but you look at Bill Gates, it's the same thing, man,
[2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:51.940]  when he's given those little black kids that live polio virus knowing it's going to cripple
[2:49:51.940 --> 2:49:55.980]  them, he looks like he's having an orgasm, or when he's on TV talking about how he's
[2:49:55.980 --> 2:50:00.700]  going to kill all the old people, we're never going to reopen, he loves it, his father loves
[2:50:00.700 --> 2:50:04.700]  it, and like a receiver, genetics don't make you the way they are, but it's nature and
[2:50:04.700 --> 2:50:10.180]  the nurture, but it's a prerequisites, it's like an antenna pointing in a certain direction,
[2:50:10.180 --> 2:50:13.340]  picking the transmission up, and the transmission's there, it's going to pick it up if somebody
[2:50:13.340 --> 2:50:18.020]  doesn't turn the antenna the other direction, and so in a family like Gates's, his mother,
[2:50:18.020 --> 2:50:21.740]  his father, the grandparents, all interbred, because they were psychotic criminals, long
[2:50:21.740 --> 2:50:26.500]  line of psychotic criminals, and so you have a genetic psychopath with Bill Gates, and
[2:50:26.500 --> 2:50:30.740]  so that's why he's such a hunger, all right, get ready ladies and gentlemen for the next
[2:50:30.740 --> 2:50:37.780]  big guest house, that's right, it's Red Voice Media, Stu Peters, Alex Jones here with a

[2:51:37.980 --> 2:51:40.980]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[2:51:40.980 --> 2:51:41.980]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[2:51:41.980 --> 2:51:46.300]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason, and amongst all
[2:51:46.300 --> 2:51:50.420]  this stupidity, wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year,
[2:51:50.420 --> 2:51:57.420]  okay, I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away,
[2:51:57.420 --> 2:52:02.700]  living defense saved my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[2:52:02.700 --> 2:52:04.740]  me, living defense brought me back.
[2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:10.500]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now, this
[2:52:10.500 --> 2:52:17.460]  is Matthew 24 verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[2:52:17.460 --> 2:52:23.380]  you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be
[2:52:23.380 --> 2:52:28.300]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another, that's right where
[2:52:28.300 --> 2:52:29.300]  we're at brother.
[2:52:29.300 --> 2:52:33.700]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[2:52:33.700 --> 2:52:41.100]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[2:52:41.100 --> 2:52:44.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:52:44.100 --> 2:53:02.140]  Look at the world we're killing, the way we found this gundale ball, see what kind of
[2:53:02.140 --> 2:53:13.900]  doubt we follow, look at the leaders we follow, and look at the lives we swallow, and I don't
[2:53:13.900 --> 2:53:25.740]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[2:53:25.740 --> 2:53:31.740]  I am your guest host, Steve Peters, RedVoiceMedia.com is where you can find me, a daily host of
[2:53:31.740 --> 2:53:33.820]  Patriotically Correct.
[2:53:33.820 --> 2:53:42.060]  The platform has been that we will never fear or we will never cower in the face of lies.
[2:53:42.060 --> 2:53:44.380]  We will always talk to credible whistleblowers.
[2:53:44.380 --> 2:53:49.660]  We will always speak the truth, which is why in the fourth hour of today's show, we're
[2:53:49.660 --> 2:53:54.980]  going to talk more about the glaring truth, about the liberal whack jobs, the hostile
[2:53:54.980 --> 2:54:00.340]  takeover, the toppling of an entire political system, because that's what we're looking
[2:54:00.340 --> 2:54:01.340]  at here.
[2:54:01.340 --> 2:54:06.380]  And when we see, you know, mass shootings happening, for example, in Atlanta, Georgia,
[2:54:06.380 --> 2:54:13.580]  in Boulder, Colorado, we have to arrive at the realistic conclusion that these incidents
[2:54:13.580 --> 2:54:21.420]  are only just now beginning as another progressive regime occupies the White House.
[2:54:21.420 --> 2:54:23.880]  And we have to realize that this is a trend.
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:27.220]  We have to be honest with ourselves.
[2:54:27.220 --> 2:54:33.620]  Being honest with ourselves in times like this after November 2020 amid a highly questionable
[2:54:33.620 --> 2:54:39.100]  election, an installed president, an installed regime, the highest paid federal employee
[2:54:39.100 --> 2:54:44.140]  in our entire government being the little twerp, Anthony Fauci, who wants you to wear
[2:54:44.140 --> 2:54:46.340]  30 or 40 masks now.
[2:54:46.340 --> 2:54:50.100]  And as Alex was saying in the last hour, to just give up everything, this is the pushes
[2:54:50.100 --> 2:54:52.340]  of inches and miles, folks.
[2:54:52.340 --> 2:54:54.540]  And we're going to get into the talk about the Second Amendment.
[2:54:54.540 --> 2:55:00.100]  Coming up also later this hour, we're going to talk with Melanie Joseph, who is a Broward
[2:55:00.100 --> 2:55:06.660]  County mother whose child was stripped from her as a result of these masking mandates.
[2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:13.540]  And this was a pre-pandemic photograph that she posted on her own social media that a
[2:55:13.540 --> 2:55:18.700]  judge, a dictatorial judge with unilateral, unprecedented authority, took into his own
[2:55:18.700 --> 2:55:23.580]  hands with his politically motivated gavel and hit her where it really hurts.
[2:55:23.580 --> 2:55:29.300]  Folks, I have said on my show multiple times at Nauseam, over and over again, I talk about
[2:55:29.300 --> 2:55:30.300]  this.
[2:55:30.300 --> 2:55:33.540]  It's only going to be a matter of time before, in the name of health and safety, they are
[2:55:33.540 --> 2:55:36.060]  after your kids.
[2:55:36.060 --> 2:55:42.220]  It happened in Broward County, Florida at the hands of Judge Dale C. Cohen, and it happened
[2:55:42.220 --> 2:55:43.220]  again in New York.
[2:55:43.220 --> 2:55:49.060]  Dr. Micheline Epstein, she went to drop her daughter off at school.
[2:55:49.060 --> 2:55:56.700]  She was standing outside on the curb, breathing fresh air on the curb at her daughter's school.
[2:55:56.700 --> 2:56:01.100]  As a result of that, her child custody rights were taken away from her.
[2:56:01.100 --> 2:56:03.480]  She was labeled a danger.
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:06.260]  She was assaulted and attacked by a school nurse.
[2:56:06.260 --> 2:56:09.660]  She was assaulted and attacked by school security.
[2:56:09.660 --> 2:56:11.900]  Nobody wants to take her case.
[2:56:11.900 --> 2:56:14.620]  She doesn't have the legal representation that she needs.
[2:56:14.620 --> 2:56:17.060]  Her crowdfunding account was completely shut down.
[2:56:17.060 --> 2:56:21.860]  Now, if you think that Big Tech is limited to how many Twitter followers you have, or
[2:56:21.860 --> 2:56:26.680]  whether or not you can get your message out, we have already been told that should you
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:30.820]  question the regime, should you question the liberals, should you speak out, should you
[2:56:30.820 --> 2:56:36.820]  bring any fact or truth to your platform that you risk being dismissed and gone completely.
[2:56:36.820 --> 2:56:41.340]  We know this, but it's not limited to your little Twitter accounts, folks.
[2:56:41.340 --> 2:56:45.300]  It's not limited to your Facebook shadow banning.
[2:56:45.300 --> 2:56:49.940]  It's not limited to an entire platform of 20 million people being shut down completely
[2:56:49.940 --> 2:56:56.660]  as Parler was taken away by the socialist communist hands of Bezos over at Amazon.
[2:56:56.660 --> 2:57:05.060]  They are now taking crowdfunding away from parents who are fighting to keep their kids.
[2:57:05.060 --> 2:57:06.940]  Let that sink in.
[2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:12.660]  The truth is the liberal Democrats don't care about the lives of mothers, immigrant mothers.
[2:57:12.660 --> 2:57:16.220]  They don't care about black lives, which is what we're going to get into as we talk more
[2:57:16.220 --> 2:57:23.540]  about this gun grab, because yes, the gun grab does relate to this lie of systemic racism
[2:57:23.540 --> 2:57:30.740]  amongst policing and in our communities as this populace is labeled the most racist population
[2:57:30.740 --> 2:57:34.620]  in the entire world as liberals apologize for us all over the world.
[2:57:34.620 --> 2:57:36.700]  Kamala Harris is now an Asian.
[2:57:36.700 --> 2:57:38.220]  She's no longer African American.
[2:57:38.220 --> 2:57:39.220]  All lies.
[2:57:39.220 --> 2:57:40.220]  We're going to talk more about that.
[2:57:40.220 --> 2:57:41.220]  My name is Stu Peters.
[2:57:41.220 --> 2:57:45.820]  This is the Alex Jones show, BanVis.tv.
[2:57:45.820 --> 2:57:50.780]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[2:57:50.780 --> 2:57:53.780]  Last week on time, they go, Jones, are you on cocaine or are you on meth?
[2:57:53.780 --> 2:57:54.780]  How are you so excited?
[2:57:54.780 --> 2:58:01.780]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced masks, forced inoculations, open announcements
[2:58:01.780 --> 2:58:03.860]  that our country is going to be dissolved?
[2:58:03.860 --> 2:58:04.860]  I'm sorry.
[2:58:04.860 --> 2:58:06.360]  I'm a fighter.
[2:58:06.360 --> 2:58:09.060]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[2:58:09.060 --> 2:58:11.100]  And so I'll just say this.
[2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:12.100]  I try to be calm.
[2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:13.100]  I try to be focused.
[2:58:13.100 --> 2:58:14.900]  I don't know what I do.
[2:58:14.900 --> 2:58:17.780]  I wasn't still on air right now.
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:22.740]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air, because you have to realize, when
[2:58:22.740 --> 2:58:26.340]  I tell you that you're the Info War, that's not me patting you on the head.
[2:58:26.340 --> 2:58:30.020]  You are 99% of the equation.
[2:58:30.020 --> 2:58:33.660]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, infowarstore.com,
[2:58:33.660 --> 2:58:37.780]  when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[2:58:37.780 --> 2:58:40.100]  So you are the Info War.
[2:58:40.100 --> 2:58:41.700]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[2:58:41.700 --> 2:58:42.900]  Thank you for all you've done.
[2:58:42.900 --> 2:59:01.300]  Now, let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[2:59:01.300 --> 2:59:02.300]  And there it is.
[2:59:02.300 --> 2:59:05.300]  Can you come up with one more?
[2:59:05.300 --> 2:59:09.740]  So I'm going to give you time for your guest hosting here in the fourth hour.
[2:59:09.740 --> 2:59:12.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:59:12.100 --> 2:59:17.180]  As promised, to relate some of these lies together in the wake of these mass shootings
[2:59:17.180 --> 2:59:20.820]  in Atlanta, Georgia, and Boulder, Colorado, we have to arrive at these conclusions that
[2:59:20.820 --> 2:59:22.460]  this is only beginning.
[2:59:22.460 --> 2:59:27.220]  We discussed that during the Obama administration, mass shootings became a regular occurrence.
[2:59:27.220 --> 2:59:31.420]  And the reason for the original assault weapons ban back in the 90s was as a result of the
[2:59:31.420 --> 2:59:37.060]  fake narrative about white supremacists and racist Republicans going nuts and shooting
[2:59:37.060 --> 2:59:38.060]  everything up.
[2:59:38.060 --> 2:59:42.420]  Remember, the old term was coined, going postal, remember this?
[2:59:42.420 --> 2:59:44.060]  Where are these assault weapons?
[2:59:44.060 --> 2:59:45.060]  That's my question.
[2:59:45.060 --> 2:59:47.580]  Where are these military grade rifles?
[2:59:47.580 --> 2:59:50.660]  Where are these so-called weapons of war?
[2:59:50.660 --> 2:59:56.620]  The difference between the AR-15 and a common 308, a 7MM, or a 300 Winni Mag, commonly used
[2:59:56.620 --> 2:59:59.940]  for deer hunting, is nothing.
[2:59:59.940 --> 3:00:02.420]  There's no difference other than appearance.
[3:00:02.420 --> 3:00:06.620]  So why has the left been able to manipulate the public so easily?
[3:00:06.620 --> 3:00:07.820]  Are these people really that stupid?
[3:00:07.820 --> 3:00:09.500]  I mean, I can't accept that.
[3:00:09.500 --> 3:00:14.660]  I refuse to believe that those who choose not to own weapons are making that choice because
[3:00:14.660 --> 3:00:16.900]  they hate weapons.
[3:00:16.900 --> 3:00:20.540]  I understand somebody not being comfortable holding or handling a firearm.
[3:00:20.540 --> 3:00:24.900]  I understand those that don't wish to shoot guns, go to the range, hunt animals, kill
[3:00:24.900 --> 3:00:30.780]  animals, or choose to defend themselves like I do, which I would consider to be appropriately.
[3:00:30.780 --> 3:00:37.140]  Most of these people live in a bubble world where they expect the police to do their jobs.
[3:00:37.140 --> 3:00:41.620]  And these people are also under the assumption that there's maybe a cop just waiting down
[3:00:41.620 --> 3:00:47.540]  the hall or in the basement, around the corner, or behind that door, just waiting to jump
[3:00:47.540 --> 3:00:53.220]  out and save their ass when the unthinkable happens, like a superhero wearing a cape.
[3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:55.540]  They can be in multiple places at multiple times.
[3:00:55.540 --> 3:00:57.780]  Nobody plans to be a victim is the point.
[3:00:57.780 --> 3:01:03.540]  It's ridiculous to accept the notion that someone wakes up in the morning, stretches
[3:01:03.540 --> 3:01:10.220]  out, opens their mouth for that last yawn, and looks at their spouse and says, you know,
[3:01:10.220 --> 3:01:12.820]  honey, today I think I'm going to go get raped.
[3:01:12.820 --> 3:01:16.300]  I mean, come on.
[3:01:16.300 --> 3:01:17.300]  That's ridiculous.
[3:01:17.300 --> 3:01:23.220]  Nobody comes home from work on a lunch break knowing that there's three armed criminal
[3:01:23.220 --> 3:01:29.260]  dogs in the basement stealing the big screen from the man cave, who then, by the way, become
[3:01:29.260 --> 3:01:33.340]  equally surprised the homeowner has arrived, forcing them to shoot and kill the unsuspecting
[3:01:33.340 --> 3:01:36.660]  family man father of three and loyal husband.
[3:01:36.660 --> 3:01:41.500]  When you're away for an evening at bowling league, gone for a business trip, or for whatever
[3:01:41.500 --> 3:01:46.940]  reason your spouse or significant other finds herself spending the night without you, she's
[3:01:46.940 --> 3:01:51.180]  not prepared for the home invasion that the two gangsters have been planning for the last
[3:01:51.180 --> 3:01:52.180]  two weeks.
[3:01:52.180 --> 3:01:55.260]  They knew about the plan, but you didn't.
[3:01:55.260 --> 3:01:56.700]  And neither did your dead wife.
[3:01:56.700 --> 3:01:58.580]  You get the point.
[3:01:58.580 --> 3:02:03.820]  People that choose to own or possess firearms to protect themselves, look at most situations
[3:02:03.820 --> 3:02:06.860]  with a different level of awareness than those that don't.
[3:02:06.860 --> 3:02:07.860]  At least I do.
[3:02:07.860 --> 3:02:14.940]  And I'm not saying that non gun owners are idiots or lack intelligence, I'm just acknowledging
[3:02:14.940 --> 3:02:19.220]  that people make different choices based on the way they were brought up.
[3:02:19.220 --> 3:02:24.780]  Based on life experiences, based on training, based on their perspective of reality.
[3:02:24.780 --> 3:02:25.780]  And that's okay.
[3:02:25.780 --> 3:02:26.780]  That's fine.
[3:02:26.780 --> 3:02:29.060]  There are different people and that's what makes the world go round.
[3:02:29.060 --> 3:02:30.940]  I'm sure that your parents told you that.
[3:02:30.940 --> 3:02:35.100]  If you grew up in a household similar to mine where I had parents that had family values,
[3:02:35.100 --> 3:02:40.420]  core values, they had a belief in something bigger than, you know, government.
[3:02:40.420 --> 3:02:42.620]  We believe in God.
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:47.140]  If you choose to drink alcohol, for example, that doesn't mean that I have to.
[3:02:47.140 --> 3:02:52.420]  If you choose to drive a car without your seat belt on, that's on you.
[3:02:52.420 --> 3:02:57.220]  If you choose to jump off of a bridge, that doesn't mean that I'm suicidal or that I want
[3:02:57.220 --> 3:02:58.220]  to die.
[3:02:58.220 --> 3:03:01.900]  If you choose to take a long walk off a short pier, you get the point.
[3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:03.300]  This is natural selection.
[3:03:03.300 --> 3:03:04.540]  This is survival of the fittest.
[3:03:04.540 --> 3:03:06.940]  This is Darwinism, I guess.
[3:03:06.940 --> 3:03:12.060]  But on the same side of the argument, if you choose not to protect yourself with a gun,
[3:03:12.060 --> 3:03:17.060]  that doesn't mean that I need to die a helpless pile of crap unable to defend myself or my
[3:03:17.060 --> 3:03:23.340]  family or total strangers for that matter when the unplanned or the unthinkable occurs.
[3:03:23.340 --> 3:03:24.860]  Nobody plans for these things to happen.
[3:03:24.860 --> 3:03:30.340]  None of those people at King's Supers planned to be gunned down in the frozen food aisle
[3:03:30.340 --> 3:03:35.780]  of the local grocery store they frequent multiple times a week.
[3:03:35.780 --> 3:03:41.180]  None of those Asian hookers planned to die inside of those so-called spas in Midtown
[3:03:41.180 --> 3:03:42.180]  Atlanta.
[3:03:42.180 --> 3:03:46.740]  But the reality is that when progressive radical Democrats are in control of the White House,
[3:03:46.740 --> 3:03:50.500]  and Liberals have the majority of control in our federal government, when cesspools
[3:03:50.500 --> 3:03:55.500]  of crime and corruption in leftist cities and states across the country continue to
[3:03:55.500 --> 3:04:01.780]  erupt in gun violence, the law-abiding citizens are the only ones that catch the blame.
[3:04:01.780 --> 3:04:05.980]  We're an educated people.
[3:04:05.980 --> 3:04:06.980]  That's why we're here.
[3:04:06.980 --> 3:04:10.380]  That's why you're here at BanThis.tv.
[3:04:10.380 --> 3:04:14.580]  That's why you watch programs like the Alice Jones Show.
[3:04:14.580 --> 3:04:18.500]  We don't have these talks with people that you associate with on a regular basis because
[3:04:18.500 --> 3:04:21.900]  more than likely there's just a mutual understanding.
[3:04:21.900 --> 3:04:25.020]  Those are the people that share your sentiment.
[3:04:25.020 --> 3:04:28.820]  People typically align themselves with like-minded people.
[3:04:28.820 --> 3:04:29.820]  We choose our friends.
[3:04:29.820 --> 3:04:31.260]  We don't choose our family.
[3:04:31.260 --> 3:04:36.580]  And those people that you choose to be around understand that there's no reasonable defense
[3:04:36.580 --> 3:04:40.340]  against a bad guy with a gun other than a good guy with a gun.
[3:04:40.340 --> 3:04:44.100]  That's why we give guns to our troops, our soldiers.
[3:04:44.100 --> 3:04:47.620]  That's why we give guns to the cops, to our police officers.
[3:04:47.620 --> 3:04:52.580]  And that's why states, counties, and cities grant law-abiding citizens a permit to carry
[3:04:52.580 --> 3:04:53.580]  a firearm.
[3:04:53.580 --> 3:04:56.860]  I mean, it's really common sense.
[3:04:56.860 --> 3:05:01.340]  Same people would never expect a social worker to go to a domestic assault call, but yet
[3:05:01.340 --> 3:05:05.700]  these liberal radicals and these democratically controlled cities like right here in Minneapolis,
[3:05:05.700 --> 3:05:08.460]  this is exactly what they're calling for.
[3:05:08.460 --> 3:05:14.660]  So critically thinking individuals don't ask cops to turn in their guns and talk down
[3:05:14.660 --> 3:05:20.740]  the gang-banging, dope-dealing career criminals that are under the influence of street drugs.
[3:05:20.740 --> 3:05:25.380]  They don't expect that a hug and some nice words are going to resolve the majority of
[3:05:25.380 --> 3:05:26.580]  these issues.
[3:05:26.580 --> 3:05:30.580]  And that's why guns exist.
[3:05:30.580 --> 3:05:34.500]  We didn't talk nicely to the British and ask permission to be a liberated people in
[3:05:34.500 --> 3:05:35.500]  the 1700s.
[3:05:35.500 --> 3:05:38.660]  I mean, come on, it's ridiculous.
[3:05:38.660 --> 3:05:43.220]  We didn't sit in a cry room and talk about our feelings with the enemy in Vietnam.
[3:05:43.220 --> 3:05:45.620]  We shot them.
[3:05:45.620 --> 3:05:51.420]  And the terrorists that wish to destroy America by whatever means necessary weren't talked
[3:05:51.420 --> 3:05:56.620]  down by social workers or with some touchy-feely diplomatic resolve.
[3:05:56.620 --> 3:05:57.620]  We shot them too.
[3:05:57.620 --> 3:05:58.620]  We blew them up.
[3:05:58.620 --> 3:06:02.940]  They were confronted with superior violence and they were killed.
[3:06:02.940 --> 3:06:10.660]  The cost of freedom, folks, is death, sad reality, breaking news, call CNN.
[3:06:10.660 --> 3:06:15.300]  And the only way to protect yourself from deadly force, sadly, most often times, is
[3:06:15.300 --> 3:06:23.020]  by responding with the violence of action and superior firepower or the element of surprise.
[3:06:23.020 --> 3:06:24.620]  Those are the facts.
[3:06:24.620 --> 3:06:30.340]  That is reality and even liberal progressives know that.
[3:06:30.340 --> 3:06:35.620]  They know that they're lying about gun control and they know the audience that they are lying
[3:06:35.620 --> 3:06:36.620]  too.
[3:06:36.620 --> 3:06:41.980]  But the fact is they don't care.
[3:06:41.980 --> 3:06:43.980]  They know they're lying about race relations.
[3:06:43.980 --> 3:06:47.460]  They know they're lying about systemic racism amongst our police community.
[3:06:47.460 --> 3:06:49.900]  They know that they're lying about minority communities.
[3:06:49.900 --> 3:06:53.380]  They know that they only talk to black people during election cycles.
[3:06:53.380 --> 3:06:56.780]  They don't care about black people any more than they care about me.
[3:06:56.780 --> 3:07:00.620]  They don't care about black lives any more than they care about white lives, Christian
[3:07:00.620 --> 3:07:02.100]  lives, or any other life.
[3:07:02.100 --> 3:07:06.300]  They don't care about anything, as a matter of fact, other than reelection and the quest
[3:07:06.300 --> 3:07:10.700]  for more power, more money, more compliance, more control.
[3:07:10.700 --> 3:07:15.060]  And typically, they get it through the feeling and emotion of fear.
[3:07:15.060 --> 3:07:20.220]  Inner cities like Chicago, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia, Portland, and Baltimore
[3:07:20.220 --> 3:07:23.740]  are allowed to go to war every single weekend.
[3:07:23.740 --> 3:07:26.700]  And the left does nothing except blame the police.
[3:07:26.700 --> 3:07:31.460]  The same cops they wish to defund are asked where they were as 60 shootings result in
[3:07:31.460 --> 3:07:36.780]  15 deaths over a holiday weekend, and their only answer is some symbolic and empty ordinance
[3:07:36.780 --> 3:07:38.940]  declaring some wacky gun-free zone.
[3:07:38.940 --> 3:07:39.940]  Come on.
[3:07:39.940 --> 3:07:46.100]  They disarm law-abiding citizens because those are the only people that will eventually reluctantly
[3:07:46.100 --> 3:07:50.340]  abide by and scrupulously adhere to the letter of law.
[3:07:50.340 --> 3:07:52.180]  That's why they're law-abiding citizens.
[3:07:52.180 --> 3:07:57.020]  This isn't coming from some damn Ivy League, Harvard, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell, higher
[3:07:57.020 --> 3:07:58.620]  liberal education platform.
[3:07:58.620 --> 3:07:59.860]  I'm speaking from here, folks.
[3:07:59.860 --> 3:08:04.940]  This is the product of a two-year post-secondary education and 18 years of life experience
[3:08:04.940 --> 3:08:09.380]  dealing with some of the most violent people you'd ever care to think about in my 18 years
[3:08:09.380 --> 3:08:12.820]  that I spent as a fugitive apprehension specialist bounty hunter, bail enforcement, whatever
[3:08:12.820 --> 3:08:16.940]  you want to call it, from someone who was responsible for locating apprehending and
[3:08:16.940 --> 3:08:20.580]  jailing those offenders that didn't want to return to prison and did it without shooting
[3:08:20.580 --> 3:08:21.580]  anybody.
[3:08:21.580 --> 3:08:22.580]  I'm speaking from here.
[3:08:22.580 --> 3:08:25.740]  I'm not saying the answer is to go out and shoot everyone that you think is a threat,
[3:08:25.740 --> 3:08:27.740]  and I'm not saying deadly force is the only answer.
[3:08:27.740 --> 3:08:31.660]  I'm saying that there is a time and a place for everything, and the fact is, although these
[3:08:31.660 --> 3:08:35.980]  communists want you to believe that every cop is a racist killer, the real truth is
[3:08:35.980 --> 3:08:41.300]  that almost a million cops, for every single day, they don't have to take a life, and most
[3:08:41.300 --> 3:08:42.740]  of them go home without doing it.
[3:08:42.740 --> 3:08:44.860]  More of the Alice Jones show next.
[3:08:44.860 --> 3:08:47.220]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[3:08:47.220 --> 3:08:49.140]  It's very bittersweet.
[3:08:49.140 --> 3:08:52.300]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[3:08:52.300 --> 3:08:54.020]  a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[3:08:54.020 --> 3:08:55.620]  I care about beating the new world order.
[3:08:55.620 --> 3:09:00.860]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer,
[3:09:00.860 --> 3:09:04.100]  and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[3:09:04.100 --> 3:09:06.980]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[3:09:06.980 --> 3:09:11.340]  We're going to see this through to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:09:11.340 --> 3:09:14.980]  So please pray for us, and please buy the products, and then forwardstore.com.
[3:09:14.980 --> 3:09:17.580]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.

[3:09:20.740 --> 3:09:21.740]  Do they fund freedom?
[3:09:21.740 --> 3:09:22.740]  No, a lot of them don't.
[3:09:22.740 --> 3:09:27.420]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[3:09:27.420 --> 3:09:29.220]  up and looking for truth.
[3:09:29.220 --> 3:09:30.860]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:09:30.860 --> 3:09:34.300]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:37.780]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.

[3:09:41.220 --> 3:09:44.980]  going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.

[3:10:47.980 --> 3:11:07.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:11:07.780 --> 3:11:09.060]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:11:09.060 --> 3:11:11.500]  My name is Stu Peters, your guest host here in the fourth hour.
[3:11:11.500 --> 3:11:17.100]  You can find me at redvoicemedia.com, the media not telling you about the nearly million
[3:11:17.100 --> 3:11:20.420]  cops every day that go out and don't take a life.
[3:11:20.420 --> 3:11:24.020]  Just like they don't want to tell you stories about like this next guest that I'm going
[3:11:24.020 --> 3:11:25.020]  to have on.
[3:11:25.020 --> 3:11:29.380]  Dr. Micheline Epstein thought it was just a normal day in her life as she was going
[3:11:29.380 --> 3:11:32.180]  to her daughter's New York school to drop her off.
[3:11:32.180 --> 3:11:37.900]  She was standing on the curb where she was assaulted and attacked by a school nurse.
[3:11:37.900 --> 3:11:42.580]  She was assaulted and attacked by school security and has now had the unthinkable happen as
[3:11:42.580 --> 3:11:48.060]  her parental custodial rights have been limited or taken away as a New York City judge has
[3:11:48.060 --> 3:11:53.860]  removed her six-year-old from Dr. Epstein because she didn't wear a mask outside.
[3:11:53.860 --> 3:11:58.220]  She exercised her right to breathe clean and fresh air, which is why I wanted to have Dr.
[3:11:58.220 --> 3:11:59.220]  Epstein on.
[3:11:59.220 --> 3:12:01.100]  Dr. Epstein, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:12:01.100 --> 3:12:02.780]  Thanks a lot for joining me.
[3:12:02.780 --> 3:12:04.660]  Hi, Stu.
[3:12:04.660 --> 3:12:07.700]  Thank you guys for having me.
[3:12:07.700 --> 3:12:09.940]  Take us through that day.
[3:12:09.940 --> 3:12:13.180]  We're limited in time here just a little bit, but I want you to take us through that day
[3:12:13.180 --> 3:12:18.260]  and then take us to how you ended up losing your daughter, who by the way just celebrated
[3:12:18.260 --> 3:12:23.500]  her sixth birthday in your absence and you celebrating her birthday in her absence.
[3:12:23.500 --> 3:12:24.500]  Horrific.
[3:12:24.500 --> 3:12:25.500]  Take us through this.
[3:12:25.500 --> 3:12:28.780]  Tell us what the mainstream media will not tell these listeners.
[3:12:28.780 --> 3:12:36.980]  Basically, I was dropping with my daughter at her school at the curb, like I said.
[3:12:36.980 --> 3:12:42.980]  They had the procedures to get her temperature measured and then there's this app where you
[3:12:42.980 --> 3:12:48.060]  have to answer questions and then they scan and I was about to leave like I always do.
[3:12:48.060 --> 3:12:53.220]  This woman came with the thermometer in her right hand and she started pushing me and yelling
[3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:58.860]  at me saying, you cannot be here, you cannot be here, this is the school in the middle
[3:12:58.860 --> 3:13:01.820]  of the pandemic, blah, blah, blah, I'm the nurse of the school.
[3:13:01.820 --> 3:13:05.700]  So I turned around and just like whatever, I just kept walking, right?
[3:13:05.700 --> 3:13:11.060]  But I walked a little bit, you know, a few steps and you know, it took me a couple seconds
[3:13:11.060 --> 3:13:16.300]  to recollect and then I was just like, did they want to just touch me?
[3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:22.460]  And then you're standing outside, you're on the curb, you're not in a building, there's
[3:13:22.460 --> 3:13:27.980]  no mask mandate where you have to wear a mask outdoors, you're socially distanced properly,
[3:13:27.980 --> 3:13:31.620]  you're not around anybody, you've sent your daughter into the school where only children
[3:13:31.620 --> 3:13:35.020]  are allowed to be and faculty, is that correct?
[3:13:35.020 --> 3:13:36.020]  That's correct, that's correct.
[3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:40.260]  And my daughter at that point was already on with her mask because she had a mask.
[3:13:40.260 --> 3:13:43.940]  So when I come back, she sees that I'm coming back, so she starts to join us.
[3:13:43.940 --> 3:13:46.060]  Don't touch me, don't get close to me.
[3:13:46.060 --> 3:13:52.140]  So I come around her, like six feet, I keep myself six feet apart and I said, ma'am,
[3:13:52.140 --> 3:13:56.620]  I'm not going to touch you, but I just want to let you know that you cannot do this to
[3:13:56.620 --> 3:13:58.940]  people because of masks.
[3:13:58.940 --> 3:14:02.140]  And she keeps like, you know, acting up.
[3:14:02.140 --> 3:14:06.700]  And then this man comes in, which I find out later is the head of the security of the school
[3:14:06.700 --> 3:14:12.660]  and with a box of masks, he picks up the mask and shows me my face and says, put the mask,
[3:14:12.660 --> 3:14:13.660]  put the mask.
[3:14:13.660 --> 3:14:19.340]  And I say, no, I pick up the mask, I rip it off, I throw in the guard, the ground, turn
[3:14:19.340 --> 3:14:21.380]  around and go back home.
[3:14:21.380 --> 3:14:22.380]  And I get home.
[3:14:22.380 --> 3:14:23.380]  I receive an email.
[3:14:23.380 --> 3:14:24.380]  Yes?
[3:14:24.380 --> 3:14:27.340]  I don't interrupt you here, but just for the sake of time, for a little bit of backstory
[3:14:27.340 --> 3:14:31.340]  here also, you have a less than amicable, less than cordial separation from the father
[3:14:31.340 --> 3:14:32.860]  of your child.
[3:14:32.860 --> 3:14:37.020]  And there has been this ongoing disarray and custody issues and disputes.
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:41.740]  So now the father of your daughter has weaponized this story, right?
[3:14:41.740 --> 3:14:44.100]  The school nurse and the security officer playing the victim.
[3:14:44.100 --> 3:14:46.740]  No, no, no, don't touch me, that's what these liberals do.
[3:14:46.740 --> 3:14:48.020]  They play the victim all the time.
[3:14:48.020 --> 3:14:49.020]  They pull this out.
[3:14:49.020 --> 3:14:54.060]  Obviously, this isn't a politically motivated or charged story, but the politics are very
[3:14:54.060 --> 3:14:57.580]  important just like politics go along with every single thing that we do in our lifetime
[3:14:57.580 --> 3:15:00.780]  where people say, I don't want to be a part of politics, but you have to pay attention.
[3:15:00.780 --> 3:15:05.420]  So you've got the mask shoved in your face, but now you find yourself in a courtroom as
[3:15:05.420 --> 3:15:10.580]  your ex or the father of your daughter has gotten ahold of an attorney and weaponized
[3:15:10.580 --> 3:15:14.340]  this thing and said, I'm going to drag Dr. Epstein, my ex, back to court and I'm going
[3:15:14.340 --> 3:15:15.420]  to weaponize this against her.
[3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:16.420]  How did that happen?
[3:15:16.420 --> 3:15:17.420]  Tell us that.
[3:15:17.420 --> 3:15:22.420]  Well, we actually still going through the divorce, the divorce is not finished.
[3:15:22.420 --> 3:15:30.940]  We were sharing a 50-50 custody, but basically that what happens is after that, you know,
[3:15:30.940 --> 3:15:40.140]  when I got home, I received a mail from the school lawyer saying that, twisting the whole
[3:15:40.140 --> 3:15:46.340]  situation saying that I had attacked the nurse, that I had like, used like a foul language,
[3:15:46.340 --> 3:15:51.940]  you name it, like all sorts of like untrue things and telling me that I could never
[3:15:51.940 --> 3:15:58.500]  come, pick up or drop my daughter from school, that I could not ever talk to the staff of
[3:15:58.500 --> 3:16:02.460]  the school, that I pay half of it, which is very expensive.
[3:16:02.460 --> 3:16:06.580]  And I was informed by my lawyer at that time that I could not take my daughter from school,
[3:16:06.580 --> 3:16:08.380]  which I wanted to do.
[3:16:08.380 --> 3:16:17.940]  So then the next thing, you know, this was on Wednesday, Monday, the next week, Monday,
[3:16:17.940 --> 3:16:25.620]  the lawyer of my husband, my suit to the ex-husband, sent a letter because he received also the
[3:16:25.620 --> 3:16:33.020]  letter to the judge that then we had an emergency hearing on the next Monday.
[3:16:33.020 --> 3:16:40.940]  And I was berated by the judge, the judge like treated me like humanly.
[3:16:40.940 --> 3:16:48.020]  And in the end, he took my daughter, he said that for at least one month, I would have
[3:16:48.020 --> 3:16:53.820]  supervised visits that I had to pay, by the way, and it would be inside of my house and
[3:16:53.820 --> 3:16:58.740]  everybody in the household, while that happened, had to use a mask.
[3:16:58.740 --> 3:17:03.660]  So you have to wear a mask inside of your own home, this is what a district court judge
[3:17:03.660 --> 3:17:07.380]  in the city of New York is ordering that you do, that you have to now wear a mask inside
[3:17:07.380 --> 3:17:08.380]  of your own home.
[3:17:08.380 --> 3:17:14.020]  Despite the fact that it's not his home, constitutionally overreaching and coming into your personal
[3:17:14.020 --> 3:17:19.180]  life, violating your constitutional rights, your individual liberties, there is no mandate
[3:17:19.180 --> 3:17:23.860]  that requires any other New Yorker to do these things, but he's holding your custody of your
[3:17:23.860 --> 3:17:28.820]  daughter and visitation with your child over your head, backing you into a corner to do
[3:17:28.820 --> 3:17:32.340]  this, and saying that you will not have any contact with your daughter unless these things
[3:17:32.340 --> 3:17:33.900]  happen, is that right?
[3:17:33.900 --> 3:17:42.700]  That's correct, and that's the only way I could potentially see my daughter.
[3:17:42.700 --> 3:17:47.260]  People have said that in cases like this, you have to be able to prove that you were
[3:17:47.260 --> 3:17:51.020]  under duress, you know, when you did a certain thing, when you made a statement in a courtroom,
[3:17:51.020 --> 3:17:55.700]  who could argue the fact that a mother is under any kind of stress or duress when you're
[3:17:55.700 --> 3:17:57.900]  being told you're given an ultimatum?
[3:17:57.900 --> 3:18:01.420]  You're either going to wear a mask in your own home, or you're not going to have custody
[3:18:01.420 --> 3:18:02.420]  of your daughter.
[3:18:02.420 --> 3:18:03.700]  This is absolutely unbelievable.
[3:18:03.700 --> 3:18:07.020]  The mainstream media not touching this story by any means.
[3:18:07.020 --> 3:18:11.420]  Now you have a crowdfunding account that you have set up for people to help you with legal
[3:18:11.420 --> 3:18:13.860]  representation as your attorneys have been walking away from you.
[3:18:13.860 --> 3:18:15.740]  You've had no luck finding somebody to replace you.
[3:18:15.740 --> 3:18:18.820]  People are telling you that this case is too complex, it seems pretty cut and dry to me.
[3:18:18.820 --> 3:18:22.500]  A judge violated your rights, took your kid away because you weren't wearing a mask on
[3:18:22.500 --> 3:18:27.100]  an outdoor street, and the criminal justice system, along with the family justice system,
[3:18:27.100 --> 3:18:31.740]  has been completely compromised and used and weaponized against a good mother who's totally
[3:18:31.740 --> 3:18:33.380]  involved with her child.
[3:18:33.380 --> 3:18:38.460]  This is ridiculous, and I hope that this judge's email is filled and inundated with people
[3:18:38.460 --> 3:18:41.460]  who are absolutely outraged by this, like I am.
[3:18:41.460 --> 3:18:42.940]  In your case is not the only case.
[3:18:42.940 --> 3:18:46.820]  We're going to talk with Melanie Joseph from Broward County, Florida, who another judge
[3:18:46.820 --> 3:18:50.540]  got another email this morning from a Miami case that didn't have anything to do with
[3:18:50.540 --> 3:18:54.900]  the pandemic, but this family justice system has to be rectified.
[3:18:54.900 --> 3:18:57.980]  Real quickly, where can people find your crowdfunding account because I want people to be able to
[3:18:57.980 --> 3:18:58.980]  help you out?
[3:18:58.980 --> 3:19:05.980]  It's actually a gift and goal, and if you go to my media, like I don't know it by heart,
[3:19:05.980 --> 3:19:09.620]  I actually hate talking about money.
[3:19:09.620 --> 3:19:17.060]  Actually a prayer would do as much if it's not more, and anybody that wants to contribute
[3:19:17.060 --> 3:19:22.060]  please, only if you feel in your heart, in your mind, in your soul that you should do
[3:19:22.060 --> 3:19:29.500]  that, but if you, like I said, pray to the real God, should you do just as much or more.
[3:19:29.500 --> 3:19:32.740]  Dr. Epstein, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:19:32.740 --> 3:19:35.620]  Again, the story, folks, is not unique.
[3:19:35.620 --> 3:19:40.580]  If you feel like prayers, great, if you have the financial wherewithal to donate to her,
[3:19:40.580 --> 3:19:41.580]  please do so.
[3:19:41.580 --> 3:19:42.940]  More of the Alex Jones show coming up next.
[3:19:42.940 --> 3:19:43.940]  Go now.
[3:19:43.940 --> 3:19:49.340]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:49.340 --> 3:19:55.020]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:19:55.020 --> 3:19:59.860]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together, and you know, it gets old having
[3:19:59.860 --> 3:20:03.540]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air,
[3:20:03.540 --> 3:20:04.540]  but it's true.
[3:20:04.540 --> 3:20:08.260]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:20:08.260 --> 3:20:12.260]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:20:12.260 --> 3:20:13.260]  everybody else.
[3:20:13.260 --> 3:20:17.220]  They crippled all the other groups, and we're still here, and as this whole new world order
[3:20:17.220 --> 3:20:20.100]  comes out in the open, our credibility's going up.
[3:20:20.100 --> 3:20:21.620]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:21.620 --> 3:20:23.740]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:20:23.740 --> 3:20:28.140]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[3:20:28.140 --> 3:20:32.060]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's
[3:20:32.060 --> 3:20:33.060]  about to unfold.
[3:20:33.060 --> 3:20:35.300]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:35.300 --> 3:20:40.420]  So thank you all, and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:20:40.420 --> 3:20:41.420]  and so much more.
[3:20:41.420 --> 3:20:44.700]  They're wonderful products, and they support the infowar, thank you.
[3:20:44.700 --> 3:20:51.300]  The new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[3:20:51.300 --> 3:20:53.700]  is only the control grid.
[3:20:53.700 --> 3:20:59.620]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[3:20:59.620 --> 3:21:00.620]  and attain immortality.
[3:21:00.620 --> 3:21:06.860]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based
[3:21:06.860 --> 3:21:07.860]  line forms.
[3:21:07.860 --> 3:21:10.420]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[3:21:10.420 --> 3:21:14.140]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[3:21:14.140 --> 3:21:16.020]  They are playing God.
[3:21:16.020 --> 3:21:22.780]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[3:21:22.780 --> 3:21:25.780]  to carry out this transformation.
[3:21:25.780 --> 3:21:30.180]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on
[3:21:30.180 --> 3:21:31.220]  record.
[3:21:31.220 --> 3:21:33.660]  You have been warned.
[3:21:33.660 --> 3:21:38.140]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[3:21:38.140 --> 3:21:41.780]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[3:21:41.780 --> 3:21:44.900]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[3:21:44.900 --> 3:21:48.620]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[3:21:48.620 --> 3:21:51.260]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[3:21:51.260 --> 3:21:52.260]  Why do you do that?
[3:21:52.260 --> 3:21:54.540]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[3:21:54.540 --> 3:21:58.860]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[3:21:58.860 --> 3:22:02.940]  Earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[3:22:02.940 --> 3:22:06.060]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[3:22:06.060 --> 3:22:07.060]  Boom.
[3:22:07.060 --> 3:22:08.060]  We did it.
[3:22:08.060 --> 3:22:09.060]  It's popular at sex three.
[3:22:09.060 --> 3:22:10.060]  Is it better than sex two?
[3:22:10.060 --> 3:22:11.060]  You decide.
[3:22:11.060 --> 3:22:12.060]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[3:22:12.060 --> 3:22:17.620]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping,
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:19.060]  and that is down and out.
[3:22:19.060 --> 3:22:23.940]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.

[3:22:53.460 --> 3:23:00.540]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a

[3:24:05.740 --> 3:24:11.660]  Hey, welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Stu Peters, Red Voice Media in here.
[3:24:11.660 --> 3:24:12.660]  You're finding this, of course.
[3:24:12.660 --> 3:24:14.420]  You're finding it on BandThis.tv.
[3:24:14.420 --> 3:24:17.420]  Make sure to visit us where the truth lives at redvoicemedia.com.
[3:24:17.420 --> 3:24:19.860]  So never going to walk away from a credible whistleblower.
[3:24:19.860 --> 3:24:23.260]  We're never going to walk away from stories that paint the real truth of what's actually
[3:24:23.260 --> 3:24:28.660]  happening here in our neighborhoods, here in our court system, massive judicial corruption
[3:24:28.660 --> 3:24:31.420]  taking place, as you heard from Dr. Epstein.
[3:24:31.420 --> 3:24:33.940]  This is overreach, folks, and it's not limited.
[3:24:33.940 --> 3:24:39.500]  I've been contacted by dozens, dozens of mothers and parents that have had the court system
[3:24:39.500 --> 3:24:42.780]  weaponized amid this coronavirus pandemic.
[3:24:42.780 --> 3:24:47.300]  Nancy Pelosi, if you think that she didn't see this thing coming from that obscure
[3:24:47.300 --> 3:24:49.940]  lab, by the way, in Wuhan, China, right?
[3:24:49.940 --> 3:24:55.020]  I wasn't called by my financial advisor and given some advice on this laboratory that
[3:24:55.020 --> 3:24:56.020]  I should invest in.
[3:24:56.020 --> 3:24:59.980]  We all know now that Anthony Fauci invested in this lab.
[3:24:59.980 --> 3:25:00.980]  Nobody questions that.
[3:25:00.980 --> 3:25:03.180]  Barack Obama, a personal investor in this lab.
[3:25:03.180 --> 3:25:08.180]  Nobody questions that, but the story for Dr. Epstein is not unique.
[3:25:08.180 --> 3:25:12.740]  We're talking now with Melanie Joseph, who had the same thing happen at the hands of
[3:25:12.740 --> 3:25:16.900]  corrupt judge Dale C. Cohen down in Broward County.
[3:25:16.900 --> 3:25:20.740]  Melanie Joseph, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[3:25:20.740 --> 3:25:21.860]  Appreciate you making yourself available.
[3:25:21.860 --> 3:25:24.300]  We know that you're going through hell.
[3:25:24.300 --> 3:25:25.300]  Tell us the story.
[3:25:25.300 --> 3:25:26.300]  Take us through what happened.
[3:25:26.300 --> 3:25:29.580]  Thank you so much for having me.
[3:25:29.580 --> 3:25:31.860]  It is definitely a living nightmare.
[3:25:31.860 --> 3:25:36.940]  So backstory is my ex and I have a time share plan.
[3:25:36.940 --> 3:25:39.380]  We're supposed to share our son.
[3:25:39.380 --> 3:25:43.820]  And when I went for my spring break that we look forward to every year, I was kept from
[3:25:43.820 --> 3:25:44.940]  my son.
[3:25:44.940 --> 3:25:51.580]  So I did what I had to do as far as trying to, you know, ask continuously to see my son.
[3:25:51.580 --> 3:25:54.020]  And when I was denied, I went through the police.
[3:25:54.020 --> 3:25:55.020]  I went through the courts.
[3:25:55.020 --> 3:25:59.780]  I went through every means necessary to see my son and I was denied.
[3:25:59.780 --> 3:26:03.780]  So I had to wait six months for a hearing and it was excruciating because we're all
[3:26:03.780 --> 3:26:05.660]  going through this time as a country.
[3:26:05.660 --> 3:26:10.380]  We have no idea why or what's going on and I'm separated from my loved one.
[3:26:10.380 --> 3:26:15.260]  And so when I had my court hearing, which was to hold the father in contempt, I honestly
[3:26:15.260 --> 3:26:16.980]  thought that I was going to see my son again.
[3:26:16.980 --> 3:26:18.340]  I had my bags packed.
[3:26:18.340 --> 3:26:20.620]  This was in September.
[3:26:20.620 --> 3:26:26.000]  And unfortunately, I was hit with something that I didn't expect and opposing counsel
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:31.540]  mentioned a picture that was on my private Facebook of me without a mask on during a non
[3:26:31.540 --> 3:26:35.940]  man data time and at my doctor's office and oral surgery.
[3:26:35.940 --> 3:26:43.100]  So because of that picture and the fact that I do carry, it really upset the judge.
[3:26:43.100 --> 3:26:48.940]  And he made a very impossible ruling against me.
[3:26:48.940 --> 3:26:50.340]  He discriminated against me.
[3:26:50.340 --> 3:26:53.500]  He called me an anti-masker, which is something I never stated.
[3:26:53.500 --> 3:27:00.100]  In fact, I said that I followed a CDC guidelines and he was really angry and said that I had
[3:27:00.100 --> 3:27:04.100]  the audacity to post on social media that I'm an anti-masker.
[3:27:04.100 --> 3:27:09.580]  And as a result of doing so, he made an example out of me and he stated that I had to get
[3:27:09.580 --> 3:27:14.940]  heard the judge, Dale C Cohen from the bench say, you know, she's one of these anti-mask
[3:27:14.940 --> 3:27:15.940]  people.
[3:27:15.940 --> 3:27:19.580]  She has the audacity to post on social media that she's one of these anti-mask people.
[3:27:19.580 --> 3:27:21.100]  I mean, I'm not making this stuff up.
[3:27:21.100 --> 3:27:22.100]  You can find this stuff, folks.
[3:27:22.100 --> 3:27:26.620]  I mean, the audio tapes are out there, you know, just to be fully transparent and candid
[3:27:26.620 --> 3:27:31.540]  here, I've interviewed you on a different platform at redvoicemedia.com and those audio
[3:27:31.540 --> 3:27:32.540]  tapes are there.
[3:27:32.540 --> 3:27:36.140]  I know that the InfoWars website as well, our interview is posted.
[3:27:36.140 --> 3:27:39.780]  And the judge actually said that for now, your time sharing is suspended.
[3:27:39.780 --> 3:27:43.220]  Completely, I mean, as you were saying, the judge isn't even looking at you.
[3:27:43.220 --> 3:27:48.540]  You're looking at a picture of this guy on your screen amid the pandemic and the socially
[3:27:48.540 --> 3:27:51.580]  distanced or virtual court hearings.
[3:27:51.580 --> 3:27:55.900]  And Judge Dale C Cohen makes this arbitrary ruling that you are not allowed to see.
[3:27:55.900 --> 3:28:00.300]  Now, here's where I want to get to something that's even more shocking, folks.
[3:28:00.300 --> 3:28:05.300]  We've talked about the fact that the government cannot or has not yet mandated these vaccines.
[3:28:05.300 --> 3:28:10.180]  I have long warned, along with the fact that these people are going to come after your
[3:28:10.180 --> 3:28:15.460]  kids in the name of health and safety, that they will also find ways to mandate this vaccination.
[3:28:15.460 --> 3:28:20.140]  Now, Judge Cohen said, what to you regarding the vaccination and the ability to, whether
[3:28:20.140 --> 3:28:22.020]  or not you could see Logan again?
[3:28:22.020 --> 3:28:26.780]  So, before the vaccine had been developed in September, he made it clear that in order
[3:28:26.780 --> 3:28:31.340]  for me to have any time with my son, that I had to take this vaccine and my son had
[3:28:31.340 --> 3:28:32.340]  to have the vaccine.
[3:28:32.340 --> 3:28:36.820]  So, I mean, that is making it mandatory.
[3:28:36.820 --> 3:28:40.060]  That is saying to you, it's giving you an ultimatum if you're going to see your son,
[3:28:40.060 --> 3:28:42.300]  that you have to take this vaccine.
[3:28:42.300 --> 3:28:48.340]  Any mother wants to see their son, you are a caring and involved mother.
[3:28:48.340 --> 3:28:52.420]  Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm speculating and I don't know you, but I do know my mother
[3:28:52.420 --> 3:28:56.660]  and I know my wife, who is the mother to three beautiful children that I am raising.
[3:28:56.660 --> 3:29:04.100]  You would walk across hot coals, shards of glass, nails to hell and back on one leg while
[3:29:04.100 --> 3:29:08.420]  bleeding and taking your last breath to spend time with your son.
[3:29:08.420 --> 3:29:13.380]  You would do anything to spend time with your son, including taking this jab because a district
[3:29:13.380 --> 3:29:15.180]  court judge is ordering it.
[3:29:15.180 --> 3:29:19.380]  That makes it mandatory in my eyes, he is mandating that you have a vaccination because
[3:29:19.380 --> 3:29:22.300]  you are an involved mother who wants to do anything.
[3:29:22.300 --> 3:29:27.020]  You would sacrifice your own life, which may be what you're doing if you take this vaccination.
[3:29:27.020 --> 3:29:28.620]  People have called it the mark of the beast.
[3:29:28.620 --> 3:29:29.620]  We don't know what's in it.
[3:29:29.620 --> 3:29:32.180]  We know that it's a cocktail that has proven to trick your body and believing that you
[3:29:32.180 --> 3:29:33.180]  have COVID all the time.
[3:29:33.180 --> 3:29:37.340]  I mean, that's a conversation for a whole mother day, but would you consider this to
[3:29:37.340 --> 3:29:38.860]  be a mandate?
[3:29:38.860 --> 3:29:40.860]  Absolutely.
[3:29:40.860 --> 3:29:42.620]  It was terrifying to hear those words.
[3:29:42.620 --> 3:29:50.500]  It's something that at the time when he said that, I considered because as you just said,
[3:29:50.500 --> 3:29:56.260]  I would do anything to see my son since that development and seeing people are dying from
[3:29:56.260 --> 3:29:57.260]  it.
[3:29:57.260 --> 3:30:02.820]  It's one of those things that you're putting me in a very dangerous place.
[3:30:02.820 --> 3:30:07.060]  Do I see my son again or do I take something that I see people dying from?
[3:30:07.060 --> 3:30:13.540]  It's been a nightmare and I haven't been able to see him in a year since that decision was
[3:30:13.540 --> 3:30:18.580]  made because of how this has been going in the courts and being denied hearings and then
[3:30:18.580 --> 3:30:24.540]  now being forced into a settlement and it's just, it's never ending because of what?
[3:30:24.540 --> 3:30:29.100]  Because the father wanted me to be out of my son's life and he used this pandemic to
[3:30:29.100 --> 3:30:30.100]  make that happen.
[3:30:30.100 --> 3:30:31.100]  Okay.
[3:30:31.100 --> 3:30:38.700]  So this is another family court system has been weaponized by an ex who has motivations
[3:30:38.700 --> 3:30:42.100]  other than the health and safety of your son and I'm going to highlight that here because
[3:30:42.100 --> 3:30:43.620]  of information that I already have.
[3:30:43.620 --> 3:30:47.500]  Now your ex claims that your son has been diagnosed with asthma.
[3:30:47.500 --> 3:30:48.500]  Is that correct?
[3:30:48.500 --> 3:30:49.500]  Yes.
[3:30:49.500 --> 3:30:50.500]  Okay.
[3:30:50.500 --> 3:30:54.660]  And so your son is diagnosed with asthma.
[3:30:54.660 --> 3:30:57.820]  Your ex is okay with your son wearing a mask.
[3:30:57.820 --> 3:31:02.060]  By the way, you have to drive to and from North Carolina back and forth between Florida
[3:31:02.060 --> 3:31:03.500]  if you want to see your son.
[3:31:03.500 --> 3:31:06.460]  The entire time that your son is with you, whether he's in the vehicle, whether he's
[3:31:06.460 --> 3:31:10.300]  at your house, whether he's outdoors, indoors, the entire time that he's with you, mind you,
[3:31:10.300 --> 3:31:14.100]  he has to stay masked despite the fact that he has an asthma diagnosis.
[3:31:14.100 --> 3:31:18.780]  So the question here is who has Logan's best interest in mind?
[3:31:18.780 --> 3:31:22.060]  And it's clear that it's not Judge Dale C. Cohen.
[3:31:22.060 --> 3:31:26.540]  It's clear that it's not the father of your son who has is the one that informed you that
[3:31:26.540 --> 3:31:29.100]  your son supposedly has this asthma diagnosis.
[3:31:29.100 --> 3:31:30.940]  We all know that you put something over your face.
[3:31:30.940 --> 3:31:34.220]  You're restricting the flow of oxygen, which probably I'm no doctor here.
[3:31:34.220 --> 3:31:40.420]  I'm no doctor Jill Biden by any means, but I'm assuming that medically it's probably
[3:31:40.420 --> 3:31:44.300]  not the best thing to do to somebody who has asthma to restrict the flow of oxygen to their
[3:31:44.300 --> 3:31:45.300]  system.
[3:31:45.300 --> 3:31:46.300]  Absolutely.
[3:31:46.300 --> 3:31:54.460]  And in order for me to see him again, which I can't see him until June still, I had to
[3:31:54.460 --> 3:32:01.220]  enter into this agreement that I'm going to abide by their restrictive rules and it's
[3:32:01.220 --> 3:32:07.420]  only for 21 days after not seeing my son for a year and being a mother to him.
[3:32:07.420 --> 3:32:12.700]  I get 21 days to see my son and he has to wear a mask.
[3:32:12.700 --> 3:32:16.060]  There it is, folks, the GoFundMe account liberating Logan.
[3:32:16.060 --> 3:32:21.500]  If you have the means or the heart or the ability to do other than just saying a prayer
[3:32:21.500 --> 3:32:27.900]  and send some money towards Melanie Joseph and her fight to get back with Logan.
[3:32:27.900 --> 3:32:28.900]  Some additional information.
[3:32:28.900 --> 3:32:30.900]  By the way, Melanie, thank you very much for joining us today.
[3:32:30.900 --> 3:32:35.620]  We really appreciate it and I hope I wish you the best of luck and I hope to hear a positive
[3:32:35.620 --> 3:32:39.140]  outcome on this case and we'd like for you to get a fair shake in front of an impartial
[3:32:39.140 --> 3:32:44.940]  judge who's not using his or her gavel for political aspirations and motivation.
[3:32:44.940 --> 3:32:49.500]  There's no reason why this system should be politicized like this, especially when it
[3:32:49.500 --> 3:32:53.260]  comes to the health and safety of our kids, the real and legitimate health and safety
[3:32:53.260 --> 3:32:54.260]  of our kids.
[3:32:54.260 --> 3:32:55.260]  Best of luck to you.
[3:32:55.260 --> 3:32:56.260]  Thanks a lot for being here.
[3:32:56.260 --> 3:32:59.620]  Can I just say really quick that Judge Cohen is doing this to other mothers.
[3:32:59.620 --> 3:33:03.980]  He's taken a 22-month-old baby from its mother for the same thing, not having a mask on at
[3:33:03.980 --> 3:33:04.980]  the beach.
[3:33:04.980 --> 3:33:06.340]  There's no reason for him to be in power.
[3:33:06.340 --> 3:33:07.700]  I'd love to see him removed.
[3:33:07.700 --> 3:33:12.300]  He doesn't have the authority and he's taking the wrong authority to destroy families.
[3:33:12.300 --> 3:33:13.500]  And thank you so much for having us.
[3:33:13.500 --> 3:33:15.460]  We really appreciate it.
[3:33:15.460 --> 3:33:16.460]  Of course.
[3:33:16.460 --> 3:33:19.300]  And we hope Governor DeSantis has made aware of this and we hope that there's some serious
[3:33:19.300 --> 3:33:23.860]  judicial reform that happens in the state of Florida as we're hearing more stories like
[3:33:23.860 --> 3:33:24.860]  this.
[3:33:24.860 --> 3:33:27.620]  Melanie said that this is happening not only to her but to other parents.
[3:33:27.620 --> 3:33:32.220]  I don't know anything about this two-year-old, but we're definitely going to look into that.
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:35.020]  And Logan also has a vaccination exemption.
[3:33:35.020 --> 3:33:38.220]  The vaccination could kill him, but yet they're going to force him to get vaccinated even
[3:33:38.220 --> 3:33:39.860]  though this thing hasn't been approved for kids.
[3:33:39.860 --> 3:33:41.500]  These stories continue all over the place.
[3:33:41.500 --> 3:33:43.420]  More on the Alex Jones Show as we continue next.
[3:33:43.420 --> 3:33:44.420]  Go nowhere.

[3:34:41.500 --> 3:34:48.860]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[3:34:48.860 --> 3:34:49.940]  of the two.
[3:34:49.940 --> 3:34:52.940]  One is born of remissants, the other is born of conquest.
[3:34:52.940 --> 3:34:58.580]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[3:34:58.580 --> 3:35:01.980]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[3:35:01.980 --> 3:35:07.220]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[3:35:07.220 --> 3:35:08.220]  it.
[3:35:08.220 --> 3:35:13.500]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[3:35:13.500 --> 3:35:16.540]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[3:35:16.540 --> 3:35:20.060]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[3:35:20.060 --> 3:35:23.860]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave
[3:35:23.860 --> 3:35:24.860]  masters.
[3:35:24.860 --> 3:35:28.860]  A global permanent lockdown is here that is already causing millions and millions of
[3:35:28.860 --> 3:35:30.100]  starve to death.
[3:35:30.100 --> 3:35:32.300]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[3:35:32.300 --> 3:35:35.940]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out
[3:35:35.940 --> 3:35:40.140]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[3:35:40.140 --> 3:35:41.140]  That's the facts.
[3:35:41.140 --> 3:35:49.060]  This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[3:35:49.060 --> 3:35:55.580]  The first of all, let me say, I love your products.
[3:35:55.580 --> 3:36:01.020]  I'm a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[3:36:01.020 --> 3:36:06.560]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:11.900]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[3:36:11.900 --> 3:36:12.900]  actually.
[3:36:12.900 --> 3:36:15.940]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[3:36:15.940 --> 3:36:19.940]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[3:36:19.940 --> 3:36:24.220]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[3:36:24.220 --> 3:36:29.180]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started
[3:36:29.180 --> 3:36:34.220]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[3:36:34.220 --> 3:36:40.580]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[3:36:40.580 --> 3:36:45.420]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:36:45.420 --> 3:36:51.500]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalist, they're the starmasks, they're a consortium
[3:36:51.500 --> 3:36:56.940]  of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, wherever you want
[3:36:56.940 --> 3:37:03.820]  to call them, that are highly predatory, and are setting up a false, famous, you land system
[3:37:03.820 --> 3:37:10.860]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation, to change the
[3:37:10.860 --> 3:37:17.140]  very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control, like a
[3:37:17.140 --> 3:37:19.580]  pawn on a chessboard.
[3:37:19.580 --> 3:37:24.500]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the news is only
[3:37:24.500 --> 3:37:26.900]  going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[3:37:26.900 --> 3:37:31.180]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to only
[3:37:31.180 --> 3:37:34.700]  cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order, but at the end of the
[3:37:34.700 --> 3:37:38.060]  day it's all about depopulation, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[3:37:38.060 --> 3:37:42.620]  end of the human system as we know it, and on its ashes a nightmare being built, only
[3:37:42.620 --> 3:37:48.540]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[3:37:48.540 --> 3:38:01.740]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:01.740 --> 3:38:15.140]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Bandis.tv, my name is Stu Peters, your guest host here
[3:38:15.140 --> 3:38:18.460]  in the final hour, I would hope that you would come and visit me where the truth lives also
[3:38:18.460 --> 3:38:21.700]  at redvoicemedia.com, ask just that you stop by and check it out.
[3:38:21.700 --> 3:38:24.820]  If you hate it, great, go away, if you love it, we ask you to stay around for a while,
[3:38:24.820 --> 3:38:29.980]  but while people don't care, these liberals about people like Melanie Joseph, that mother
[3:38:29.980 --> 3:38:33.860]  in Florida, they don't care about Dr. Epstein in New York, these liberals don't care about
[3:38:33.860 --> 3:38:39.100]  anything which is proven by these inner cities that continue to burn while crime-ridden neighborhoods
[3:38:39.100 --> 3:38:44.060]  and these liberally controlled cities, the media stays quiet, nobody does a damn thing
[3:38:44.060 --> 3:38:47.820]  while they burn to the ground, nobody does anything to address the real problem while
[3:38:47.820 --> 3:38:53.980]  10 innocent people are murdered by an Islamic terrorist at a supermarket, and now here we
[3:38:53.980 --> 3:38:57.180]  go with the left calling for gun confiscation.
[3:38:57.180 --> 3:39:02.020]  When will black Americans learn that the left doesn't care about their lives?
[3:39:02.020 --> 3:39:05.740]  We need you over here, we need more common sense black Americans here, there are a lot
[3:39:05.740 --> 3:39:10.780]  of you out there as proven by the numbers that President Trump had in a record smashing
[3:39:10.780 --> 3:39:14.940]  election on November 3rd in 2020.
[3:39:14.940 --> 3:39:19.140]  More blacks voted for him than for Barack Obama, but yet we're being told that that
[3:39:19.140 --> 3:39:20.140]  was for Biden.
[3:39:20.140 --> 3:39:23.180]  Okay, we're supposed to believe that, but I mean seriously, how do you defend any of
[3:39:23.180 --> 3:39:24.180]  this as a liberal?
[3:39:24.180 --> 3:39:28.300]  You can't, you can't defend it with any logic or reason and that's why most liberals are
[3:39:28.300 --> 3:39:29.300]  angry people.
[3:39:29.300 --> 3:39:33.220]  Can you imagine going to bed every night knowing that you're actually saying everything that
[3:39:33.220 --> 3:39:36.460]  isn't true, knowing that you're lying, knowing that you don't believe in a damn thing that's
[3:39:36.460 --> 3:39:40.260]  coming out of your mouth because you can't speak any sense at all because you'd be considered
[3:39:40.260 --> 3:39:41.260]  a traitor to your party.
[3:39:41.260 --> 3:39:46.340]  These people are the most insincere, unauthentic, empty souls in existence, they just simply
[3:39:46.340 --> 3:39:50.860]  don't care about black people and the thought that this narrative is being broadly accepted
[3:39:50.860 --> 3:39:56.060]  tells me that I'm either living among the most stupid people the world has ever seen
[3:39:56.060 --> 3:40:01.260]  and that I underestimated the American populace or that the media is lying again and if I'm
[3:40:01.260 --> 3:40:04.500]  in Vegas betting on those odds I would take the latter.
[3:40:04.500 --> 3:40:09.740]  The fact is the majority of people don't accept this as a reality.
[3:40:09.740 --> 3:40:13.460]  The fact is they're not going to give up their guns and we can't.
[3:40:13.460 --> 3:40:17.220]  Now I don't want to keep beating on this 2A issue folks but it's so important that we
[3:40:17.220 --> 3:40:19.740]  don't give an inch on this Second Amendment.
[3:40:19.740 --> 3:40:24.860]  We cannot allow for magazine capacity restrictions because next is the weapons then the platforms
[3:40:24.860 --> 3:40:27.220]  then all of them.
[3:40:27.220 --> 3:40:31.260]  To address my earlier point, asking about where these assault weapons are, these weapons
[3:40:31.260 --> 3:40:33.700]  of war, they aren't out here.
[3:40:33.700 --> 3:40:40.140]  The media wants you to look at the AR-15 as a big black scary gun that's capable of mowing
[3:40:40.140 --> 3:40:44.500]  down hundreds of people in a second and that's just not true.
[3:40:44.500 --> 3:40:50.220]  If you thought about the AR-15 and you thought those things then you need to educate yourself.
[3:40:50.220 --> 3:40:54.260]  We've highlighted the fact that liberals are liars and they know it.
[3:40:54.260 --> 3:40:58.820]  Most of them are ugly people also just a side note and most are really, really stupid
[3:40:58.820 --> 3:41:01.380]  but others are just educated liars.
[3:41:01.380 --> 3:41:06.060]  Most of them spot off about how educated they are, anytime someone with real truthful and
[3:41:06.060 --> 3:41:10.220]  insightful, honest perspective dares to question their platform, call them out on their BS
[3:41:10.220 --> 3:41:13.060]  or point out their lies, they always resort to name-calling.
[3:41:13.060 --> 3:41:16.700]  You're a racist, you're a sociopath, you're just a Trump-supporting bootlicker.
[3:41:16.700 --> 3:41:21.100]  We've heard it all and it really is a shame that the term racist doesn't really carry
[3:41:21.100 --> 3:41:26.420]  the same weight that it previously used to whereas in my history, if I were to have been
[3:41:26.420 --> 3:41:32.300]  called a racist, which historically I never was, I would have taken that very seriously.
[3:41:32.300 --> 3:41:34.460]  Now I'm a racist every day.
[3:41:34.460 --> 3:41:35.460]  You understand what I'm saying?
[3:41:35.460 --> 3:41:39.820]  I have a platform, I speak the truth at Red Voice Media, I'm not scared to talk to real
[3:41:39.820 --> 3:41:44.020]  whistleblowers on my daily program as I expose corruption and so of course I'm a racist and
[3:41:44.020 --> 3:41:45.020]  a bigot.
[3:41:45.020 --> 3:41:46.020]  I get that.
[3:41:46.020 --> 3:41:48.580]  I'm a white nationalist, a radical conservative, deplorable, clinging to my religion and guns
[3:41:48.580 --> 3:41:53.180]  and I wear it like a badge of honor, it's a shame but it really almost is a compliment
[3:41:53.180 --> 3:41:55.380]  to be labeled as a racist these days.
[3:41:55.380 --> 3:41:59.500]  And if you really want the truth, most people aren't racist but the rhetoric is breeding
[3:41:59.500 --> 3:42:02.460]  racism where it previously would not have existed.
[3:42:02.460 --> 3:42:07.940]  There's a story at RedVoiceMedia.com that I glanced past the other day as Ray is doing
[3:42:07.940 --> 3:42:11.500]  great work over there posting more truth, Biden is now being forced into appointing
[3:42:11.500 --> 3:42:14.500]  less white people.
[3:42:14.500 --> 3:42:18.140]  This was a clip that I actually saw in a real conversation being had on one of these fake
[3:42:18.140 --> 3:42:24.540]  news networks and it's just the cutest little display of racism I have ever seen.
[3:42:24.540 --> 3:42:31.500]  It's the spit directly in the face of those that the left commonly likes to prop up as
[3:42:31.500 --> 3:42:38.380]  their examples of heroic figures in our past, say for example Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[3:42:38.380 --> 3:42:43.060]  They take his name in vain every time they utter it because he's rolling over in his
[3:42:43.060 --> 3:42:48.380]  grave as the real party of racism continues to lie to Americans about how far we've come
[3:42:48.380 --> 3:42:52.940]  as a country to become less racist.
[3:42:52.940 --> 3:42:57.340]  Never mind the fact that millions of people pour into the United States every year to
[3:42:57.340 --> 3:43:02.500]  escape real oppression and real racism, no.
[3:43:02.500 --> 3:43:07.500]  Instead we listen to the real racists who are handing out jobs, literally appointing
[3:43:07.500 --> 3:43:12.660]  people to the highest level of our federal government based not on their qualifications
[3:43:12.660 --> 3:43:20.700]  or the content of their character but simply for the color of their skin, for their gender,
[3:43:20.700 --> 3:43:25.220]  for their sexual orientation because they cut off their man parts.
[3:43:25.220 --> 3:43:31.300]  It's ridiculous, I don't give a damn if the surgeon general is black or white.
[3:43:31.300 --> 3:43:36.860]  I could care less if he's Christian or Muslim or what political ideology he or she or it
[3:43:36.860 --> 3:43:37.860]  or them represent.
[3:43:37.860 --> 3:43:40.580]  I don't care if they're gay, I don't care if they're straight, I don't care if they
[3:43:40.580 --> 3:43:43.980]  used to be a man posing as a woman as long as they are qualified to be there.
[3:43:43.980 --> 3:43:46.500]  I mean hello.
[3:43:46.500 --> 3:43:50.540]  This is the epitome of racism.
[3:43:50.540 --> 3:43:55.500]  And while we're on the hypocrisy kick, I can't help but think about what's going on as I'm
[3:43:55.500 --> 3:44:01.140]  watching here in New York with the sexual harasser Andrew Cuomo.
[3:44:01.140 --> 3:44:06.180]  I mean folks, I understand that this is a false flag.
[3:44:06.180 --> 3:44:09.900]  It's no different than all the mass shootings that we're going to see over the next four
[3:44:09.900 --> 3:44:14.620]  years while these whack jobs look to rid you of your right to keep in their arms.
[3:44:14.620 --> 3:44:15.620]  It's all fake.
[3:44:15.620 --> 3:44:19.660]  It's a distraction away from the tens of thousands of grandparents that Cuomo sent to modern
[3:44:19.660 --> 3:44:22.700]  day progressive death camps.
[3:44:22.700 --> 3:44:24.500]  It's a political save.
[3:44:24.500 --> 3:44:28.180]  Would you rather be known as a rapist and a sexual harasser or would you rather go down
[3:44:28.180 --> 3:44:30.780]  for killing 15,000 people?
[3:44:30.780 --> 3:44:35.260]  Over 15,000 people are dead because Cuomo decided that political maneuvering was more
[3:44:35.260 --> 3:44:37.060]  valuable than those lives.
[3:44:37.060 --> 3:44:38.060]  Lives don't matter to liberals.
[3:44:38.060 --> 3:44:41.420]  I think I've done a good job of highlighting that already, so I digress for the sake of
[3:44:41.420 --> 3:44:46.260]  time, but I mean what happened to taking these allegations seriously?
[3:44:46.260 --> 3:44:50.540]  They got up there and lied about now Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh and they did it knowing
[3:44:50.540 --> 3:44:51.540]  they were lying.
[3:44:51.540 --> 3:44:56.180]  They intentionally tried to destroy the life of a good man knowing that he was a good man
[3:44:56.180 --> 3:44:59.700]  and knowing that nothing that they were saying was true.
[3:44:59.700 --> 3:45:01.500]  Don't you remember Me Too?
[3:45:01.500 --> 3:45:04.660]  What happened to Me Too?
[3:45:04.660 --> 3:45:07.620]  What happened to the death hornets, by the way?
[3:45:07.620 --> 3:45:12.340]  I feel like we skipped past the murder hornets, but how are young women and daughters supposed
[3:45:12.340 --> 3:45:16.620]  to grow up and be strong and independent women?
[3:45:16.620 --> 3:45:22.060]  The loony left and the media is silent after all these women have come forth with serious
[3:45:22.060 --> 3:45:25.500]  and believable allegations, some of which are on tape.
[3:45:25.500 --> 3:45:31.620]  There was nothing there in the way of proof with Kavanaugh, but we see it here and here
[3:45:31.620 --> 3:45:32.620]  we go.
[3:45:32.620 --> 3:45:35.100]  We have the proof, the media, silent.
[3:45:35.100 --> 3:45:36.100]  All of them.
[3:45:36.100 --> 3:45:39.660]  I don't favor one cable news broadcast network over the next folk.
[3:45:39.660 --> 3:45:41.860]  They're all fake, fake.
[3:45:41.860 --> 3:45:46.740]  There isn't a shred of decency in any of the major broadcast networks and some of these
[3:45:46.740 --> 3:45:51.860]  newer so-called conservative platforms are equally as responsible for the fall of Trump
[3:45:51.860 --> 3:45:57.380]  and the Republican Party as the Democrats and Rhinos currently serving as elected representatives
[3:45:57.380 --> 3:45:58.380]  in the swamp.
[3:45:58.380 --> 3:46:01.660]  These establishment people have to go.
[3:46:01.660 --> 3:46:05.740]  We have to address what happened in 2020 before we can move on, but seriously, if these women
[3:46:05.740 --> 3:46:10.500]  aren't to be taken seriously now, I'm only left with the option of knowing that the glaring
[3:46:10.500 --> 3:46:15.340]  truth about liberal progressive Democrats is that racism and sexual assault is only
[3:46:15.340 --> 3:46:18.500]  to be tolerated if you want to be known as a real liberal.
[3:46:18.500 --> 3:46:22.420]  We can't take these allegations seriously now because Cuomo's a Democrat and I'm a Democrat,
[3:46:22.420 --> 3:46:25.900]  so if I speak out against this documented sexual harassment, which is more than likely
[3:46:25.900 --> 3:46:31.740]  an indicator that he's a rapist, I will be outcasted from my party.
[3:46:31.740 --> 3:46:33.700]  The War Room with Owen Shroyer is up next.
[3:46:33.700 --> 3:46:35.700]  I wonder what he has going on.
[3:46:35.700 --> 3:46:37.580]  Owen, how are you?
[3:46:37.580 --> 3:46:38.580]  I'm doing great.
[3:46:38.580 --> 3:46:43.420]  You're doing your segment there on fire finishing up the Alex Jones show today and so I'm glad
[3:46:43.420 --> 3:46:47.580]  to be on here with you and I want to let people know that today is the Veterans Calling
[3:46:47.580 --> 3:46:51.300]  Show here on the War Room, so we dedicate the entire War Room to veterans.
[3:46:51.300 --> 3:46:55.340]  We'll also take active duty callers today, weigh in on all the subjects you just talked
[3:46:55.340 --> 3:46:57.820]  about, weigh in on all the subjects of the day.
[3:46:57.820 --> 3:47:01.020]  The big story right now is the southern border, though.
[3:47:01.020 --> 3:47:03.380]  I don't know if you've seen, but some senators went down there.
[3:47:03.380 --> 3:47:05.340]  They got taunted by the cartels.
[3:47:05.340 --> 3:47:06.340]  It's all on video.
[3:47:06.340 --> 3:47:07.980]  It's pretty dramatic stuff.
[3:47:07.980 --> 3:47:10.820]  They're putting kids in hotel rooms with unidentified adults.
[3:47:10.820 --> 3:47:11.820]  We don't know who they are.
[3:47:11.820 --> 3:47:13.540]  I don't see how anything could go wrong with that.
[3:47:13.540 --> 3:47:14.540]  Yeah, I did.
[3:47:14.540 --> 3:47:15.540]  I saw that.
[3:47:15.540 --> 3:47:18.140]  I saw Senator Ted Cruz was down there in full Geraldo mode.
[3:47:18.140 --> 3:47:22.140]  He had his black vest on, so he really came seriously and all these Republicans now pretending
[3:47:22.140 --> 3:47:24.940]  like they care about the alien invasion down there.
[3:47:24.940 --> 3:47:27.500]  I don't know how I can take these people seriously either.
[3:47:27.500 --> 3:47:31.020]  They had how many years to take care of this situation?
[3:47:31.020 --> 3:47:34.860]  There's always been a crisis at the border down there and they had a president that wanted
[3:47:34.860 --> 3:47:38.900]  to do something about it, and now all of a sudden, Owen, here they are.
[3:47:38.900 --> 3:47:39.900]  We're down here.
[3:47:39.900 --> 3:47:40.940]  Oh, shh, everybody be quiet.
[3:47:40.940 --> 3:47:42.620]  There's violence back here.
[3:47:42.620 --> 3:47:43.620]  Over here.
[3:47:43.620 --> 3:47:44.620]  Come on.
[3:47:44.620 --> 3:47:45.620]  I mean, we've got to pretend now.
[3:47:45.620 --> 3:47:46.620]  This is ridiculous.
[3:47:46.620 --> 3:47:51.300]  Yeah, well, the numbers, though, the numbers are overwhelming, so I'm glad that at least
[3:47:51.300 --> 3:47:53.740]  they're doing it, even if it is for the cameras.
[3:47:53.740 --> 3:47:55.860]  I hope you have a great show.
[3:47:55.860 --> 3:47:58.420]  Everybody stay tuned for what's coming up with Owen Shroy on the war room.
[3:47:58.420 --> 3:47:59.420]  On the war room.
[3:47:59.420 --> 3:48:00.420]  Excuse me.
[3:48:00.420 --> 3:48:01.420]  There's a tongue twister coming up next.
[3:48:01.420 --> 3:48:02.420]  My name is Stu Peters.
[3:48:02.420 --> 3:48:06.860]  I hope that you will come and visit me over at RedVoiceMedia.com, where we are unafraid
[3:48:06.860 --> 3:48:10.020]  to talk about the lying hypocrisy and how it's true.
[3:48:10.020 --> 3:48:12.260]  We're talking about the truth every single day over there.
[3:48:12.260 --> 3:48:17.860]  My daily program is on at 6 p.m. Eastern on all of the places where you can find a podcast.
[3:48:17.860 --> 3:48:20.060]  The Alex Jones show, of course, I will see you here.
[3:48:20.060 --> 3:48:24.580]  I believe every single Friday, unless I've been fired already, my name is Stu Peters.
[3:48:24.580 --> 3:48:28.020]  The Alex Jones show continues for about another five seconds, but we're going to throw it
[3:48:28.020 --> 3:48:30.500]  over to Owen Shroyer and the war room right now.
[3:48:30.500 --> 3:48:31.980]  Thanks for having me.
[3:48:31.980 --> 3:48:32.980]  I appreciate it.
[3:48:32.980 --> 3:49:01.980]  Have a great day.
