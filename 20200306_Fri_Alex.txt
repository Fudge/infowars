[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  So we're signing the 8.3 billion and he asked me two and a half and I got 8.3 and I'll take it.
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.000]  Okay, so here we are, 8.3 billion, very well, but it's an unforeseen problem, what a problem.
[00:48.000 --> 01:14.000]  All hell is breaking loose. As we told you five weeks ago, this virus is the big one. You can see what China did, you can see what other companies started doing, that meant that the globalists were going to absolutely promote this like it was the end of the world.
[01:14.000 --> 01:24.000]  Well, Trump I think had a good response saying don't panic, but the media's absolute out of control behavior itself as a hoax.
[01:24.000 --> 01:44.000]  Well, now the models are at millions and millions dying, there's a new computer model out that shows two plus dead million people by July, but again, these are just models, other Landsat models, you know, show 15% death rates, not 2%.
[01:44.000 --> 02:00.000]  This is not like the flu, if it's anywhere near 1%, the flu doesn't really even kill in most models, one tenth of 1%. It might kill 1% of people that are over 80 or who already have preexisting conditions, yes.
[02:00.000 --> 02:22.000]  But regardless, this is a huge seismic event taking place, Friday, March 6, 2020, 241 days out from the historic election. We have several huge guests on today. Mike Adams will be on in 30 minutes with the latest models on the death rate that we'll see in the United States.
[02:22.000 --> 02:34.000]  And then Professor Anthony Hall is going to be joining us from the UK. He's very prolific in his big papers on this. I've gotten some of the widest traction and circulation with the scientific evidence out there.
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.000]  So we're going to be laying all of that out for you as well in the third hour. I did open the phones up and take as many calls as we can. There's so much other news.
[02:43.000 --> 02:57.000]  Also unfolding, we've got people like Joe Biden, emblematic of the decay of the Democratic Party, who now can't remember what God is. He goes, you know, that thing.
[02:57.000 --> 03:08.000]  And now he can't remember Obama's name. He says, you know, the guy before the last guy. So he is in dementia. He is demented. He says demented things.
[03:08.000 --> 03:18.000]  That's where the word dementia comes from, meaning demented, because it's sad, even very moral, loving, good, old people sometimes become very nasty and because a lower brain kind of takes over.
[03:18.000 --> 03:27.000]  Well, Joe Biden's always been a real nasty person going all the way back to corn pop. And so it's going to be quite, I mean, this is spectacular.
[03:27.000 --> 03:41.000]  It's been said that truth is strange with the fiction. Well, you're getting a front row seat to the ever seen like an old vampire movies, the allegory of the sun hits the vampire and they turn into dust right in front of you or the Skexies, the dark crystal.
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  That's what this is like. We're watching a slow motion. Not even slow motion now.
[03:48.000 --> 04:03.000]  Daily degeneration and what were four months out or so from the DNC event. What a freak show. What a clown car overloaded or 100 clowns trying to get in a phone booth.
[04:03.000 --> 04:13.000]  This is going to be crazy because these people are disconnected from reality and they can't help but just keep pushing their power as everything slips their fingers.
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.000]  So that's coming up. I'm going to hit coronavirus first in the big developments when we come back. All hell's breaking loose.
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  Four shelves across the country are selling out ammo selling out swarable food sold out for everybody else five weeks ago. We've got the food.
[04:27.000 --> 04:36.000]  Just have to package it and get it out. It's just an insane time to be alive. It's all coming up today. But there's the model.
[04:36.000 --> 04:45.000]  There's the model right there. We're going to be getting to pandemic projection shows 2.16 million deaths in USA by July 4.
[04:45.000 --> 04:54.000]  The articles at news wars dot com and info wars dot com and the man that did the study and the analysis will be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  You may know him. His name is Mike Adams. I'm Alex Jones.
[04:58.000 --> 05:10.000]  The evidence is overwhelming. Coronavirus is a man made by a weapon designed to destroy nation states economies and free peoples and usher in a planetary government.
[05:10.000 --> 05:21.000]  This is how the globalists are striking back. Here's a fortune headline today. Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[05:21.000 --> 05:33.000]  And that's just in one nation. Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China. The reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[05:33.000 --> 05:47.000]  That's how major this is. Everyone needs to be prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games. Info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out.
[05:47.000 --> 05:58.000]  Regardless of the fact of the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth. We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word about band video and info wars dot com today.
[05:58.000 --> 06:22.000]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind.
[06:22.000 --> 06:36.000]  We were not supposed to be on air by now. You're supposed to be taken off the air. Donald Trump was supposed to be removed from office already.
[06:36.000 --> 06:55.000]  And now you've got Chuck Schumer openly threatening members of the Supreme Court saying we're going to get you. We know when he says that he comes after you with illegal spy networks both corporate and private and governmental.
[06:55.000 --> 07:11.000]  He wants clandestine operations against the people of the United States. What an incredible time to be alive. Thank you for joining us on this Friday, March 6 2020 transmission with only 241 days left until the election.
[07:11.000 --> 07:30.000]  The US has put together a big report with a computer model. Pandemic projection model shows 2.16 million deaths in the USA by July 4. He joins us about the hour that full report with all the graphs and information the mathematics is up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com.
[07:30.000 --> 07:45.000]  You can check it out. Other models and the numbers I got from my Pentagon sources are just off what is being said by Lancet and by CDC that they think it kills around 2% of people.
[07:45.000 --> 08:00.000]  And that's the 2% that are already at the hospital and that are already really six. I think it's much lower than that. But let's just worst case scenario say 2%. And they are thinking about half the public will be exposed to it. So that's three plus million dead.
[08:00.000 --> 08:27.000]  The model shows 2.16 million dead by July 4. We also have Professor Anthony Hall. Joining us Professor of globalization studies University of Lethbridge in Canada but where he is now Professor emeritus he's going to be joining us he's got a lot to say that's coming up.
[08:27.000 --> 08:44.000]  Let me just say this about the coronavirus. You can 100% now say that this is going to be a gigantic crisis in a huge fiasco and that it's designed to bring down the world economy and the whole thing stinks to high heaven and we know the virus is man made.
[08:44.000 --> 09:01.000]  And I pray that the virus is not very deadly because I don't people dying and I've got children I especially don't want them dying and I don't want this to be a big crisis in an emergency nobody does except the globalist because they said will use pandemics and big
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  outbreaks to make the world except.
[09:05.000 --> 09:17.000]  Globalism but it's globalization that has allowed all this to happen. We've got a big special report that has not even been posted to band on video yet or news wars dot com yet we're going to be premiering.
[09:17.000 --> 09:24.000]  Start of the next hour.
[09:24.000 --> 09:36.000]  The coronavirus was reportedly going to be saving globalism but instead it's going to be its undoing.
[09:36.000 --> 09:58.000]  Is blaming Trump and the nation state and things like that and we said if they start blaming Trump when they're the ones demanding border stay open when they were the ones a month ago saying let Chinese flights fly in when Trump took action and blocked the flights.
[09:58.000 --> 10:08.000]  The president signed this emergency declaration today. That's what it is not just emergency funding it's an emergency declaration is already ones in place secretly we told you about that on Monday.
[10:08.000 --> 10:17.000]  And within I put it within about a week or two it'll be a public national declaration but it's already in place Trump's quietly been doing a lot to deal with it.
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  But.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  On the other side.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  Trying to play it down because he understands being used an economic weapon it is a balancing act.
[10:26.000 --> 10:37.000]  But if you look at the drone shouting at people and the public being sprayed on the streets of China and men running through office buildings up people's death spraying them in the face.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  With this toxic chemical it's reportedly killing insects and animals and making people sick.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  How many people gotten sick or died from that.
[10:47.000 --> 10:58.000]  So it's all obviously a huge hysteria inducing panic by government to clamp down and get control because governments everywhere are becoming obsolete.
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  This is this is the prime reason you're seeing hysteria in my view.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  If there was real mass death going on there is some of that happening.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  If they weren't in position to be ready to hype it up and take control of it they would play it down there have been many pandemics you never hear about.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  Everybody knows that everybody knows in small towns especially people know each other like.
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  Why is there a funeral every hour right now why are why are three people dead on my block.
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  Well because there's been deadly pneumonia SARS like stuff that hit my family six years ago three dead in one month.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  I know I harp on that ladies and gentlemen.
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  But they were all the same ranch three different houses all got it all dead and I was there at the big hospital in Palestine.
[11:39.000 --> 11:48.000]  That's the name of the town and near our ranch and the doctors are like yeah there's a giant cover up.
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  So again if there's a real pandemic going on they're very good at covering it up.
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  So we know they're hyping it for maximum effect but we know that there are piles of body bags and piles of dead bodies and Iran.
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  We know all of that has come out.
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  So this is very lethal.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  For the level of its spread and how fast it spread and the fact that it hasn't even really gotten its legs yet.
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  It gets a high death rate 1% 2% that's still extremely high.
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.000]  Flu is less than one tenth of 1% something that Trump said that was wrong was this is just like the flu 2%.
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.000]  No Mr. President the flu doesn't kill 2% of people that get it.
[12:36.000 --> 12:44.000]  So Trump's being set up that much we know is clear but I think he's navigated it well so far despite all the attacks.
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.000]  Job growth smashes expectations for February his unemployment falls back to 3.5%.
[12:50.000 --> 13:00.000]  So let's go to a key piece of video now that's posted at drudgereport.com and people need to go watch this video because the way big globalist corporations
[13:00.000 --> 13:10.000]  and leftist companies like Costco and now Socialists Run Italy was taken back from the Nationalists are all trying to create the maximum fear.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  It's like Starbucks trying to cause a race war member asking why it's why they were evil people.
[13:14.000 --> 13:24.000]  This is what the left does and they use their corporate power to create the hysteria and to create the precedent and to create social movements.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  Well they want you right now to be scared.
[13:27.000 --> 13:53.000]  So the videos at drudgereport.com video Costco customers sprayed with disinfectant at the door and here's that footage.
[13:53.000 --> 14:03.000]  So people are coming into Costco and a man is there spraying an unknown chemical out of a water bottle sprayer like you spray your plants
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  and he's spraying them on the hands and it's like it's hitting him in the chest and they're not asking.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  They just walk up and show your Costco card and start spraying.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  This is mass mind control.
[14:14.000 --> 14:28.000]  This is mob psychology. The virus has been proven to be airborne and has been proven that its main transmission point is through the nose through the mouth of the lungs and into the eyes.
[14:28.000 --> 14:37.000]  So goggles and masks that are sealed are the way to go if you really want to take care of yourself.
[14:37.000 --> 14:45.000]  But I knew something was big again five weeks ago when I tried to buy mask and they were all sold out.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  And then I noticed oh we sell those masks and I looked and there they were and I said leave them at this regular discount price.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  They sold out with about two days the ones we had.
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  And I've got some mask and things at home but the biggest thing everybody needs to do is boost their immune system.
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  You can have storeable food and that's great. You can have a bunch of toilet paper. That's wonderful.
[15:07.000 --> 15:17.000]  But what you really need is to boost your immune system and I will just point out that elderberry is so available everywhere and so low price that you know it's easy to get everybody should just get it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:24.000]  And remember I was saying you need to get in the store about three weeks ago they're going to buy up the store shelves that's starting to happen of key staples.
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  You need elderberry. We don't sell it. It's everywhere. You can get it.
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.000]  But DNA Force Plus is back in stock with the PQQ and the CoQ10. Totally boost your immune system.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  That's 40% off infowarstore.com and that ships out every day. That's not on a waiting list like the food.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  Well it's not a waiting list. We have the food but there's like six to eight weeks for delivery.
[15:43.000 --> 15:58.000]  But everything else is delivered within just a few days at infowarstore.com.
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  We're required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.000 --> 16:33.000]  Oh can I ever. We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:33.000 --> 16:43.000]  You owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less. Call OMGTax right now for a free tax saving consultation.

[16:57.000 --> 17:04.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[17:04.000 --> 17:12.000]  I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:17.000 --> 17:25.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[18:13.000 --> 18:18.000]  It actually still has food. It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got a package and they got the food.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing and that's drink purified water. That's a prey.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  That's get focused. That's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans up the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in.

[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[19:31.000 --> 19:39.000]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago,
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  it started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[19:43.000 --> 19:51.000]  We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right now at m4store.com and I'm telling you folks, get it.

[20:01.000 --> 20:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  You are receiving this transmission. You are the resistance.
[20:31.000 --> 20:38.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  Coming up, Mike Adams has got the latest breakdown.
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  Pandemic projection model shows 2.16 million deaths in U.S. by July 4th.
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  Ammunition sales soar in response to coronavirus pandemic.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  Video on dredgereport.com.
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  Costco customers spray with disinfectant at the door.
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  Journalists shocked at lack of coronavirus checks after returning to U.S. from Italy.
[21:06.000 --> 21:14.000]  Already, major cities across the United States are suddenly reporting giant spikes in crime.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  I've got the numbers right here out of Fox, New York and others.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  What's happening?
[21:21.000 --> 21:26.000]  And how bad is it going to get? How crazy is this attempt to destabilize civilization going to get?
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  I said it for the last few months. I said, will it be an economic collapse?
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.000]  Will they use a war or a bio weapon to create the hysteria to kill the economy?
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  And here it is. And it's pointed at Trump again.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  And we can sit there and say, is he doing the right thing?
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  Is he getting people ready? Do they have the testing kits? What's happening?
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's all armchair quarterbacking, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.000]  It was Obama allowed China to buy this virus.
[21:52.000 --> 21:58.000]  That's why we're on air to put out the narrative of all the points and then let you decide what you think is going on.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  So I'll have a guest on that doesn't think it's a big deal. I'll have one on that thinks it's really bad.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Because they're all people I respect to have different perspectives.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  People get really confused when they're illiciters. They go, wait a minute.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  You'll have one guest on saying one thing, another saying another thing.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  I'm going to say what I believe.
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  And that shifts as we learn more, but it's always basically the same approximation.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  But if I get information that proves me wrong, I'll admit it.
[22:21.000 --> 22:32.000]  But you know, most of the time we are proven right because we're expert guests, amazing research, people with integrity, amazing callers who bring in all sorts of angles.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  And most of the time we come to the right decision.
[22:36.000 --> 22:50.000]  And all the studies show that that the local rule, local human decisions, average people, the knowledge of the crowd are way more accurate than establishment.
[22:50.000 --> 22:59.000]  I was on the street four years ago. I can tell you that Trump was going to win despite their fraud and he did.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  Because that's where the real Intel is is on the street.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  I'm out there on the streets and so are you. You're the real people. We're the real people.
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  We don't want to be in the elitist ivory towers, preening each other about how powerful we are and how smart we are. It's disgusting.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  Let me shift gears. Another big subject that ties into all this right now.
[23:19.000 --> 23:30.000]  I remember growing up and there would be people here visiting from France or visiting from Germany or visiting from England.
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  To our church or to our school or their people from New York visiting.
[23:34.000 --> 23:40.000]  And they'd see big, huge buildings and jet airplanes and golf courses and swimming pools and jet boats.
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  They're like, we thought everybody rode horses to work. We thought Texas was a desert.
[23:45.000 --> 23:55.000]  Well, half of it is a gigantic state, half of its planes and forest and swamps.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  It's basically almost everything you can imagine, but in that is where the globalists operate. Ignorance.
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  Remember Gruber? He said, thank God the public doesn't have a memory. He's the guy that wrote Obamacare.
[24:06.000 --> 24:14.000]  He said, it's going to triple prices, but thank God the public's so stupid and doesn't have the memory of a goldfish, which we literally have one lower than them on average.
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  So everything's so fractured. People just go on. That's why Brian Williams could say he was shot down in a helicopter and none of it was true.
[24:20.000 --> 24:30.000]  And he's back on air saying it again, basically because his constituency of viewers are in a trance.
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  Those of us that have memories, it's just, it's like you're a superhero compared to the general public.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  And I'm not a superhero. You're not a superhero. We're just normal or halfway normal.
[24:42.000 --> 24:53.000]  The reason I bring that up, another Brian Williams, the New York Times editor, the editor, went on national TV.
[24:53.000 --> 25:06.000]  We'll get to it in a moment and agreed that Bloomberg spent $500 million and he could have given every American a million dollars for that.
[25:06.000 --> 25:17.000]  No, there's not 500 Americans Dumbo. There's 327 million citizens and about 40 million illegal aliens depending on how you look at it.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  So that's not that brother. He doesn't have enough money to give anybody that much money.
[25:22.000 --> 25:31.000]  Let's do the math. If he's got $78 billion divided into, the illegal aliens get money too, say $370 million.
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  Divide that with $78 billion. Let's see how much money he can give everybody.
[25:39.000 --> 25:47.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, that's how these people operate as if you're a total moron.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  I mean, they're running Biden who can't talk and it hit me the other day.
[25:51.000 --> 25:58.000]  That's on purpose. They're giving us a mentally retarded, stroke-addled dementia patient.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  And I'm sad that that's the case because we are now a nation of drones and of low IQs.
[26:04.000 --> 26:15.000]  And so in the land of the mentally disabled, you're going to have a king that's mentally disabled by idiocracy.
[26:15.000 --> 26:30.000]  Not your head be bigger. This man, I'm not sure, is the smartest man on earth. I'm not sure about that. And he's going to fix all the problems in one week.
[26:30.000 --> 26:39.000]  So let's get to Biden first who doesn't know who was the last president.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  He refers to Obama as the last guy here at us.
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  They're going to have a conversion of the road to Damascus.
[26:47.000 --> 26:55.000]  Because now you say, by the way, are you going to stick with the president on the following president, the last guy on this issue?
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  And just start naming them, whatever it is.
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.000]  And he can say, oh, that's just one little faux pas. No, it's everything. He can't remember anything.
[27:03.000 --> 27:13.000]  He's voting super Thursday. Oh, that's not this is my wife. Wait, that's my daughter. That's my he doesn't know where he is.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  Now let's go to the next piece here.
[27:17.000 --> 27:25.000]  New York Times editor Brian Williams, not the one that said he got shot down on the helicopter humiliated after suggesting each American could receive one million from Bloomberg's father million.
[27:25.000 --> 27:35.000]  Dude, that's 500 people could get a million dollars, not 327 million, not counting illegal aliens.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  And they're not even retracting it. They're proud of it because they're doing it on purpose. Here it is.
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  But you see it as a possibility if he wants to spend a billion bucks beating this guy, he could do it.
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  Absolutely. Somebody tweeted recently that actually with the money he spent, he could have given every American a million dollars.
[27:54.000 --> 28:02.000]  I've got it. Let's put it up on the screen. When I read it tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear.
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.000]  Bloomberg spent 500 million on ads. U.S. population 327 million. Don't tell us if you're ahead of us on the math.
[28:09.000 --> 28:17.000]  He could have given each American one million dollars and have had lunch money left over. It's an incredible way of putting it.
[28:17.000 --> 28:26.000]  It's true. It's disturbing. It does suggest what we're talking about here, which is there's too much money in politics.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  And it makes it difficult because what we want...
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  Now, I decided to start doing this. I've never lied on air, but I decided to see if you'd catch that because I don't think you have a memory.
[28:35.000 --> 28:41.000]  That is the Brian Williams that said he got shot down on a helicopter with the New York Times editor.
[28:41.000 --> 28:48.000]  But I just wanted to see it because Gruber thinks you don't have a memory. I think you went, wait a minute, that is Brian Williams, Alex.
[28:48.000 --> 29:16.000]  See? But the average person would buy that. It's incredible.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[29:22.000 --> 29:48.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[29:52.000 --> 30:02.000]  In this primitive survival tool, feel the thrill only at SlingBow.com.
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  Owl Killer in New Jersey. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[30:05.000 --> 30:11.000]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again, and I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  So, that Super Blue Florida free toothpaste and that Super Blue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[30:16.000 --> 30:24.000]  I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night, and it absorbs into your gum. It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  I literally just took a turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[30:27.000 --> 30:35.000]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  So, I just want to get that out of the way. Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[30:40.000 --> 30:47.000]  Nobody knew about FD. Nobody knew about Bilderberg. Nobody called 9-11 before it happened. In July 2001, go look it up yourself.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here, but yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[30:59.000 --> 31:07.000]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here, and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over him.
[31:07.000 --> 31:15.000]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem, and we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[31:15.000 --> 31:25.000]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowars.com,
[31:25.000 --> 31:32.000]  and it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[31:32.000 --> 31:38.000]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and Trump won't do anything about it.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[31:41.000 --> 31:52.000]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[31:52.000 --> 31:58.000]  And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[31:58.000 --> 32:06.000]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[32:06.000 --> 32:16.000]  That's good. People need to be self-sufficient. The average person is living hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[32:16.000 --> 32:27.000]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared, and that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there that you only go to in emergencies.
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.000]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[32:32.000 --> 32:41.000]  And things like DNA Force Plus that's now back in stock is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[32:41.000 --> 32:50.000]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra-12 and along with Vito-Elemental Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[33:29.000 --> 33:47.000]  It's all of our amazing guests, our incredible callers, the experts, the investigative reports on the street, the live, unfiltered connection between a powerful media network and the people energized by the truth, protected and empowered by God.
[33:47.000 --> 33:59.000]  We are honored to be here at the tip of the spear. Thanks to your commission, your support of the Info War, we are ready for duty and fighting as best we can.
[33:59.000 --> 34:05.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, global Friday transmission, March 6, 2020.
[34:05.000 --> 34:16.000]  Mike Adams will be with us about 15 minutes into the next hour. We're going to him here in just a few minutes with huge news, as huge as it can get, and we're going to tie it all together and get the best approximation of what's coming up.
[34:16.000 --> 34:23.000]  First, I want to just finish what I was getting into last segment because I was being a little bit silly there.
[34:23.000 --> 34:35.000]  The globalists, the CFR, the social engineers, the psych warfare experts, Jonathan Gruber that wrote Obamacare said on TV, thank God you're so stupid and have no memory.
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.000]  That's how we're going to triple your prices because by the time your healthcare prices triple, which is now done in the last 10 years, crippled.
[34:42.000 --> 34:52.000]  You'll never know what hits you because you won't remember that we promised you it would make your healthcare free and then it would cost a phone bill and then you could keep your doctor.
[34:52.000 --> 35:06.000]  Well, Biden's out there now, I can't remember Obama's name, doesn't know his wife from his daughter, admits it, and this latest piece of footage, Brian Williams, the disgraced scumbag,
[35:06.000 --> 35:17.000]  it's up on inforwars.com, who said he was shot down in a helicopter and got caught lying about it and supposedly retired, but they brought him back because they know you don't remember.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  This audience remembers.
[35:19.000 --> 35:35.000]  And the New York Times editor, Mara Gay and MSNBCO's Brian Williams faced humiliation after they erroneously suggested that Mike Bloomberg's 500 million ad spin could have been used to give each American
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  one million dollars, folks.
[35:37.000 --> 35:45.000]  When I saw that headline this morning at inforwars.com, I thought it was a joke.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  And I went and watched the footage.
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  And no one in the comments was going, this is the guy that said he got shot down in a helicopter.
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  He wasn't even in a helicopter.
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  No helicopter got shot down.
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  Nothing was shot at helicopters.
[35:59.000 --> 36:13.000]  But again, no one will remember next week that they said that if you spend 500 million and you give each American a million dollars, that's the Americans you can.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  That's 500 Americans.
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  If you give the amount of money that Bloomberg spent 500 million, you give a million to each person that you can.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.000]  That's 500.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  That's not 327 million, not counting the little aliens.
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  We did some math here on some calculator during the break.
[36:30.000 --> 36:39.000]  If you divide 327 million, I'm no mathematician like Mike Adams and engineer, but I was able to do this.
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  I'm like a superman today.
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  I'm actually able to tie my shoelaces.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  I'm not even good at math.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  That's what's scary is that the general public system down.
[36:48.000 --> 36:57.000]  If you divide 237 million, this is so stupid.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  It's so ridiculous.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  I can't even talk.
[36:59.000 --> 37:14.000]  If you divide 327 million into 78 billion, you get $238.53.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  That's what each American could have gotten.
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  He spent 200 and something bucks on each person and it went nowhere because he's so disconnected from reality.
[37:21.000 --> 37:32.000]  He's like spitting on his hands and rubbing food at buffet and shaking dog's faces and dressed up like little mermaid with a fork and tail on and Mary Poppins.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  And I'm saying all this and it doesn't sound real, does it?
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  That a dude that says he was shot down in combat in a helicopter never did it.
[37:39.000 --> 37:45.000]  He's on TV saying Bloomberg could have given every American a million dollars.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  Talk about loaves and fishes, man.
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.000]  I'm going to stop ranting about this, but just he actually makes my head not even hurt.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  This level of ignorance makes it shut down.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  But since I mentioned it, let's just play the club.
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.000]  I'm going to my cat.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  Here's what they said on TV last night.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  Brian Williams.
[38:09.000 --> 38:16.000]  But you see it as a possibility if he wants to spend a billion bucks beating this guy, he could do it.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  Absolutely.
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.000]  Somebody tweeted recently that actually with the money he spent, he could have given every American a million dollars.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  I've got it. Let's put it up on the screen.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  When I read it tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  Bloomberg spent 500 million on ads.
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  U.S. population 327 million.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Don't tell us if you're ahead of us on the math.
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.000]  He could have given each American one million dollars and have had lunch money left over.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  It's an incredible way of putting it.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  It's an incredible way of putting it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  It's true.
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  It's disturbing.
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  It does.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  It does suggest, you know, what we're talking about here, which is there's too much money in politics.
[38:55.000 --> 39:01.000]  And it makes it difficult because what we want.
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.000]  This is so incredible that I've, it's made me actually probably lose 100 IQ points.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  Do you realize what just happened?
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  I jumped ahead to the logical fallacy they're involved in that they think he's got 78 million dollars.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  So if he gave all that away, it'd be a million per person.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  So we went ahead and just did the equation into all of his wealth.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  And of course, it wouldn't be anything.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  Guys, do the math.
[39:27.000 --> 39:40.000]  What is 500 million divided by 327 million?
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  We're talking about pennies.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  $1.53.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  So that's how much you would get in the real mathematical equation.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  But again, Mike Adams, we'll get to the huge subject when we come back.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  I'm sorry for having you here holding while I went into this, but it's just, it's made me not even be able to operate.
[39:59.000 --> 40:06.000]  That they're up there putting a tweet up that producers looked at that they preplanned that she puts up.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  They've got to know that that's not true.
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  So what's the sigh up now to see if they can get away with just false math statistics?
[40:15.000 --> 40:26.000]  They really are that stupid to give every American a million dollars Bloomberg would have had to spend $327 trillion trillion with a T.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  But nobody in left wing media can do math.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  They are mathematically illiterate.
[40:31.000 --> 40:40.000]  So when they talk about global warming and carbon dioxide and sea levels, they're the same idiots who can't do math when it talks about Bloomberg spending.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  They have no knowledge of numbers.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  They can't do basic calculations.
[40:44.000 --> 40:54.000]  I mean, this is this is really about what seventh grade math, fifth, fifth grade math, maybe, and they can't even accomplish that, which is why they don't understand where this coronavirus is going as well.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  And we're going to give that next segment.
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  But what is the phenomenon where I tune into TV and it's worse than theocracy?
[41:01.000 --> 41:08.000]  It didn't come in 200 years like Mike Judge predicted in the great, you know, landfill, avalanche.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  We're here and it's like it's insane.
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  Well, and the fact that there were at least three people there at that network that could not find this error.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  Brian Williams, his guest and whoever created the graphic.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  Nobody looked at that and said these numbers can't possibly add up.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  Nobody.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  So there's there's no quality control there.
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  There's no fact checking.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  There's no mathematical literacy.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  And of course they don't understand science or politics or history or hell.
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  I've got a great crew and I make a mistake sometimes.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  They don't control what I say, but they'll tell me and I go, oh, yeah, I said that wrong.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  Everybody does that song.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  Yeah, sure.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  But how do you sit there and think that $500 million gives 327 million people a million dollars a piece?
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  That's like saying two plus two equals 50,000.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  Yeah, right.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  Well, no, I mean, I make mistakes too.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  On your show the other day, I said I was doing projections of the virus.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  I said 1,024,000.
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  That should have been 1,280,000 because I was just doing the math in my head at the moment.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  So yeah, we make mistakes, but these people had a chance to fact check this and they still mess it up.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  And it's such an obvious answer.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  It's not like they're doing exponential math here.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  It's basic.
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  Yeah.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  If you're giving one person a million dollars from the 500, that means 500 people get a million dollars.
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  Well, I guess, you know, with Joe Biden saying half the people in America have already been killed by gun violence.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  And now everybody gets a million dollars from Bloomberg.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  I mean, who needs economics, man?
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  Who needs any education?
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  Who knew that 160-something million people died of or 170 million died from guns?
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  I didn't know that.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Yeah, they're mathematically illiterate.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  Everybody at that network is as brain damaged as Joe Biden.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  And now their candidate is literally a mentally retarded person.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  They are.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  One day away from riding on the walls with their VCs.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  I'm sorry, it's insane.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  We're right back with Mike Adams with a huge news.
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.000]  The best product.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  If you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it.
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  Try turbo force with everything.
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  I put turbo force in my coffee.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  That was a crazy week.
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  I'm going to wake up today.
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.000]  You know what?
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  I don't think that happens very often.
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  It's never happened to me.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[43:47.000 --> 43:48.000]  I want to take control of my health.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  Don't buy into the group think.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  Drink the turbo force.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.000]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election.
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  And already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy.
[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  They're trying to start wars.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  They're trying to overthrow the president.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.000]  They're trying to silence free speech.
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  They're trying to trigger riots in the streets.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  But everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved,
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  And we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  That's why it's so critical to go to Infowarsstore.com
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  and stock up on high quality preparedness items from

[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  A total complete absolute 360 win.

[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  The only way we can be defeated is if you don't take action.
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  Get high quality products at Infowarsstore.com today.
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  And I told Alex.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  And it's fluoride free.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  because after I brush my teeth with this,
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  after I brush my teeth with this.
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  It feels so good.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day
[45:46.000 --> 45:52.000]  rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  Yeah. Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[46:10.000 --> 46:11.000]  I love women.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  You may have problems with her.
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  You may get a divorce.
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.000]  You may whatever.
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  when I left.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storeable foods,
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.000]  we've got the best out there because I want you to get a great result
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  and to come back and get it again as a customer
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  and fund our political spiritual operations against the globalist.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  So if you want storeable foods and everybody else is sold out
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  and you want them delivered to your door and you want to be high quality,
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.000]  then take action now at infostore.com.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  I got to tell you, the next week or two, I may come out and say,
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  sorry, no more food sales.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  We've sold out just like we've done with supplements and other things.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  So get your orders in now today at infostore.com.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  Protect yourself and your family.
[46:56.000 --> 47:15.000]  Become independent.
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  All right.
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  He's with us for another 30 minutes.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  We went right to him in about 60 seconds.
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  Mike Adams, naturalnews.com, Malish Jones, infowars.com.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  We have Professor Anthony Hall.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  He's been very prolific on how deadly this virus really is
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  and predicting what was going to happen
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  at the University of Lethbridge in Canada.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  Professor of Globalism.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  And he's going to be joining us as well.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  We're going to have open phones in the next hour.
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  I'll get the number out here at the end of this segment for free for all.
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  Briefly.
[47:46.000 --> 47:52.000]  Yes, we fund ourselves showing immune-boosting supplements
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  that are documented on record to be good for your body.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  I mean, nanosilver is on record taking on viruses and bacteria.
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  It's in our entire line of high-quality silver products.
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.000]  And it's patented and it's amazing.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  It's in the super silver wound gel.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  It's in the super silver toothpaste.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  It's in the super blue toothpaste.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  And it's still discounted at 50% off
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  even though we're very close to selling out.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  And infowars.com.
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.000]  We have horrible food.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  We went and got the biggest, best folks in the last 11 years,
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  my patriot, and they've got the food.
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  They've got to package it.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  But you order it from us.
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  You get it.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  You get it about five times less than you get it in stores.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  And it's high-quality.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  They got the food.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  They got to package it and get it out to you.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  So infowars.com for that.
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  But we also have DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  that does clean out every cell in there
[48:37.000 --> 48:43.000]  and helps grow more engine parts inside the cells,
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  the mitochondrial engines.
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  That's back in stock.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  It's all 40% off.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  The DNA Force Plus, the Turbo Force is back in stock.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  The Ultra12 is back in stock.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  The X2, all of it, is 40% off
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  because we're not going to raise prices.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  In fact, we're going to lower prices during this crisis.
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  We sold out all the immune gargle.
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  More of that gets in end of next week.
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  So you're funding the info war.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  You're getting great products you need.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  You're bolstering your immune system,
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  which I think is even more important than storable food.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  It's great to have storable food.
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  It's great to have water filtration.
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  That's very important.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  But boosting your immune system right now is the way to go.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  Our ultimate turmeric formula.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  Bodies back in stock, 40% off.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  Very high-level curcuminoid.
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  We're known to boost the immune system.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  Protect the body from so many things.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  It isn't a panacea.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  It's not perfect, but it's amazing.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  It's back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  Okay, I'm going to try to shut up the next three segments
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  and try to give you the floor.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  I want to just start with this, though, Mike.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  The video's up on dredgerport.com.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  Costco customers sprayed with disinfectant
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  at the door.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  So the same hysteria we saw in China has now begun.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  Here, here it is.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  This is London.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  The inter-radio listener is a man there
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  with a spray bottle spraying.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  People just blasting him across their hands and body.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  So now they're building up to what happened in China.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  We've got ammunition cells soared in response to coronavirus.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  Rationing and robbery, coronavirus,
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  outbreak, sparks, crime wave.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  I mean, there's just schools getting shut down all over.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Whether this thing's super deadly or not,
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  the hysteria the Chai comms began
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  has now been set the precedent.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  And you've got a huge report
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  at naturalnews.com.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  You're going to lay out now.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  Pandemic projection model shows 2.16 million deaths
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  in U.S. by July 4th.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  Again, that's not absolutely what's going to happen.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  That is just a projection.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  The best you can do, lay it out for us.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  Look, the rest of the headline of that
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  is that we'll have 2.16 million deaths
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  in the U.S. by July 4th
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  if nothing is done to halt all domestic travel.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  I think it's very important
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  to have the rest of that headline together with that story
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  because this is a theoretical model
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  that shows what will happen
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  if we don't stop domestic travel.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  And as such, it's not a prediction.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  We won't actually have realistically
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  2 million deaths by July 4th
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  because the president will declare a state of emergency.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Fair travel will be shut down.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  Cities will be under quarantine.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  Roadways will have armed checkpoints
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  and so on and so forth.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  In other words, what this model shows
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  is with no restraints whatsoever,
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  with no boundaries,
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  with an R not value of only 1.82,
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  this will kill 2 million Americans by July 4th.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  Again, if there's no lockdown.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  But governors and the president
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  will not allow that to happen.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  But let's look at the model.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  The math is solid.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  The math is rock solid.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Not only did I work on it myself,
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  but I had another scientist review it in my laboratory.
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  It was also an organic chemist
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  and a former professor of organic chemistry.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  We're all good at math.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  Here's how this begins.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  By April 4th,
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  this model predicts 580 total deaths
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  by April 4th.
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  Cumulative.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  Now, that 580 deaths from April 4th
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  goes to 10,400 deaths
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  by May 4th.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  By June 4th, it's 153,000 cumulative deaths.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  And then by July 4th, it's 2.16 million deaths.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  Now, at some point,
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  this gets halted.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  Because at some point, governors say,
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  okay, no more travel.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  Shut down all the schools, all the universities,
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  all the roadways.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Everybody's in isolation for 30 days.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  That's coming. Trust me on this point.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  The real lesson from this model is that
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  all of you listening and watching right now,
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  you have probably fewer than 30 days
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  to get prepared, to get everything done.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  If you need to bug out of the city,
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  if you need to have a relative move in
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  and live with you so you can care for them,
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  if you need to get your preps finalized,
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  you've probably got less than 30 days
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  to get that done.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  There's no question that this is all coming down.
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  Now, this model uses very conservative numbers.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  We started the model
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  with only around 600 people infected today.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  Think about that.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  I believe there are 10,000 people infected,
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  but the model starts with only 600
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  because we wanted to keep it really
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  very conservative.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  The model assumes that people are infectious
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  for 14 days.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  It assumes a 98% cure rate
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  and only a 2% mortality rate.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  And there's a 14-day lag time
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  from the time that people get infected
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  to the time that they die
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  or get cured.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  By the time you calculate all this in,
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  you get roughly a doubling of the number of cases
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  in a little over seven days
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  an r-not value of 1.82,
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  which is very, very low.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  Many scientists believe the r-not value
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  is really about 4 or 5 or 6.6
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  even I've seen in some studies.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  So the bottom line, Alex,
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  is that this is
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  going to
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  force the president
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  to declare what I'm calling
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  kind of a, well, a national emergency
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  at the local level, medical-martial law.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  There will be quarantines.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  There will be checkpoints.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  There will be probably mobile cremation
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  ovens in American cities.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  Specifically in Seattle,
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  probably in Los Angeles,
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  probably in New York City.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  Just about everything that you saw in China
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  will be translated
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  to America with slightly less draconian measures.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  For example,
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  people won't be welded into their apartment
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  buildings in the United States.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  Let's hope we don't see that.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Now this model, just as another clarification,
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  this is revision one
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  of this model.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  It's going to change as more data become available.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  So
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  for this model, we use data up to yesterday.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  As more data rolls in,
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  we will update the model. The numbers might go
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  higher, might go lower.
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  But the exponential spread of this
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  means it's a massive emergency
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  no matter which way you
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  try to sugarcoat it.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  It also means that the American people
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  are not ready for the isolation that's coming.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  The average American person thinks that they're going
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  to be able to just go out and buy groceries
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  and take their kids to school
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  and go to the doctor when they need to
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  and take airplane flights for business meetings.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  All of those things will cease
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  temporarily.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  It may be months.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  So I'm recommending right now
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  if you thought you needed a 30-day
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  survival plan,
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  you really need more like a 90-day survival plan.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  Maybe you need
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  a six-month survival plan.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  Personally, I go way beyond that,
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  but it's up to you.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  The point is that the shutdown is coming
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  and there will be economic consequences
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  that are extreme
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  from this.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  Again, look, I don't want to
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  crash the stock market either.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  We don't want to hurt the American economy.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  We want Trump to get through this.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  But Trump is going to be forced into these decisions
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  where workers are going to be sent home.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  People will have no paychecks.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  Many American millions of Americans.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  That's what's happening everywhere else.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Why is it so much worse in Europe, we're told?
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  Is there an institutional cover-up
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  of the number of deaths here already?
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  Well, there's a lag time
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  in the United States, a 30-day lag time
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  caused by the CDC. Great question.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  I'm glad you asked that.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  We have to remind viewers that the CDC set up
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  President Trump to be blamed
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  for the explosion that is about to occur.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  So the CDC intentionally
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  withheld testing kits.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  Even today, right now,
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  we were saying this weeks ago, now the Democrats
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  are saying that.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  Oh, yeah. So, I mean, we had
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  the public health person of Oregon state
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  that he believed there were maybe 500 infections
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  in Oregon days ago.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  In Seattle and Washington, as you and I know,
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  there was an outbreak a month ago that was covered up.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  There are probably thousands of cases
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  in Seattle and the surrounding areas right now.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  That doesn't even count California.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  And you said here over a month ago,
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  that would be the epicenter of Seattle.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  That's what our sources said.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  That they weren't putting out the kits.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  They were sabotaging it on purpose.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  They were not blaming Trump.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  We're not blaming Trump.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  In fact, Trump has been set up to be blamed.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  I think, look, the CDC
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  has always hated Trump.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  When Trump was elected, people in the CDC
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  cried. He cut their funding massively.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  This is their revenge.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  This is their revenge. And look, the CDC
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  just got $2 billion.
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  He cut their bio weapons BS, which he should.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  That's right. Just as Francis Boyle says,
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  the bio weapons research should be shut down.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  The CDC is not your friend.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  We're here for disease communication.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  In essence, they're multiplying
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  the disease across America.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  I believe it on purpose.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  Well, let's get back in to your study.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  I want to be clear.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  There are other big models
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  that are much worse.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  The Pentagon, the news
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  thinks 3-plus million deaths.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  I hope none of this is accurate.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  This is just a model off the numbers we've got.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.360]  folks to tune in. This is important.
[57:47.360 --> 57:50.600]  Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant streams of text
[57:50.600 --> 57:53.840]  messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying
[57:53.840 --> 57:57.600]  is coronavirus really deadly? How bad is it really? So I would
[57:57.600 --> 57:59.960]  encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, swirable foods.
[57:59.960 --> 58:01.920]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that
[58:01.920 --> 58:04.280]  actually still has food. It does take five to eight weeks to
[58:04.280 --> 58:06.280]  get it to you because they got a package and they got the food.
[58:06.320 --> 58:09.360]  I would encourage listeners to do the most important thing and
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.120]  that's drink purified water. That's a prey. That's get focus.
[58:12.120 --> 58:14.200]  That's not be stressed out because you're prepared and
[58:14.200 --> 58:17.640]  that's get DNA force plus the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out
[58:17.640 --> 58:20.160]  the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune
[58:20.160 --> 58:23.320]  booster you can engage in the X2, the X3, the foundation,
[58:23.320 --> 58:26.800]  everything, the Ultra 12 back in stock are nano silver, super
[58:26.800 --> 58:29.440]  silver and super blue toothpaste. It's still 50% off.

[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:16.560]  The globalists are going to strike back Mike Adams natural
[1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:21.960]  news.com has done a great job. Like a weather forecaster on
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:24.280]  this last five, six weeks here on air and people are really
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:26.840]  tuning in. We're seeing explosive numbers because they're
[1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:30.120]  going wow, these guys really laid it out. I've had the bio
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:34.640]  weapons treaty expert on we've had all these other folks on we've
[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:38.320]  got this other big professor Anthony Hall coming up next hour
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:40.680]  Mike's going to leave us hearing about 15 minutes that I'm
[1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:44.760]  going to open the phones up and take your calls on this but the
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:48.520]  hysteria and the response to it's massive. And the and then
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:52.400]  now our deaths, you know, taking place of what might
[1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:54.840]  continue. I'm going to host the next four minutes. This is a
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:58.480]  short segment getting into the facets of this breakdown of the
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:01.960]  numbers you've done. Well, it's it's really easy to watch where
[1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:05.520]  this is going because we can monitor this on April 4. If we
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:09.800]  have fewer than 580 deaths in the United States by April 4,
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:13.520]  then we know that the scenario is a better case than than this
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:17.080]  model predicts. If we have more than 580 deaths that it's far
[1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:20.320]  worse, which means we would have way more than 2.1 million deaths
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:24.000]  by July if nothing is done to stop this. And again, I just
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.400]  want to reiterate, please ask your editors update that headline.
[1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:30.880]  I don't want anybody to think that this is a prediction that's
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:34.160]  that has no qualifiers that this is this is a model of
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:37.200]  I understand what you're saying shut down we put up the live
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:41.600]  show feed names are coming on with alert pandemic projection
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:47.280]  model shows 2.16 million deaths in US by July 4. Or that was an
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:49.720]  earlier article we posted this morning. We need to make sure
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:52.400]  that the sub headline is there and the sub headline. Oh, there
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:55.760]  it is. Thank you. Okay, awesome. Well, no, no, no, no, we need
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:57.720]  to update it. So it needs to be updated with what your sub
[1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:02.800]  headline was. And that was if the necessary emergency protocols
[1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:03.440]  aren't put in place.
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.760]  That's right. And what it means is that Trump will have no
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:11.520]  choice but to shut down much nearly all domestic air traffic
[1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:14.280]  that's commercial not private aviation or general aviation
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:18.120]  but but commercial aviation will will largely be shut down.
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:21.520]  There's no question now about this. The quarantines will come
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:24.520]  in the roadway checkpoints will come in. There will be social
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:27.440]  isolation orders cancellation of every public event that you can
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:32.080]  imagine everything. It's there's no question that the only way
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:35.400]  that this can be stopped barring a sudden miraculous
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:38.560]  emergence of an antiviral drug or a vaccine that actually
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:42.760]  works which is highly unlikely. This this explodes. It
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:45.800]  explodes even way beyond what my model predicts unless we have
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:50.200]  social isolation. That's the only answer here. Every governor
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:54.360]  already knows this. In fact, remember, Alex, that we were
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.160]  talking about this around Thanksgiving, the US military
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:02.040]  was purchasing massive supplies of night vision devices. And
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:04.640]  one of my sources told me that's because they know that city
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:07.160]  quarantines are coming. And they're going to have to enforce
[1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.160]  the quarantines using night vision devices to stop people
[1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:13.800]  from escaping on foot at night. And we were all wondering
[1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:17.440]  what's that all about? And that was a month before we knew
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:21.520]  about the Wuhan outbreak. But it was in other words, there are
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:23.680]  people that higher ups who already knew this was going to
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:28.200]  happen around Thanksgiving last year. So they've been planning
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:30.520]  for this for a very long time and they've been buying gear for
[1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.760]  a long time. And these are the same people now that are
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:35.640]  telling you don't have any gear, you don't need any food, you
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:38.000]  don't need a mask, you don't need anything like that smoke
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.280]  they've done right there. The CDC says you don't need masks.
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:44.360]  Well, they've got pants, emergency factories going for
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:46.720]  the government. I mean, that's that's not that's not good.
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:52.480]  No, and look, Trump needs to fire about 20 people right now at
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:55.640]  the CDC at the FDA at the NIH, he needs to get good people in
[1:03:55.640 --> 1:03:57.560]  there who are going to give him honest, transparent
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:00.240]  information so he can share that with the American public. And
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:03.880]  Francis Boyle, oh, he unloaded on your show the other day. And
[1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:07.800]  he just said that the CDC is criminally negligent. And that is
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:11.680]  absolutely true. I concur with that opinion. The CDC top
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.240]  officials are criminally negligent. And they're going to
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.200]  get millions of Americans killed. If we don't shut this thing
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:20.120]  down right now. And if we shut it down, the economy is going to
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:22.760]  take a hit. There's no way around it, Alex. People better
[1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:26.720]  prepare this. It's going to look fine for the next 45 days.
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:30.360]  After that, it explodes. It goes uncontrolled unless we shut
[1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:33.000]  this whole country there in the final segment with Mike Adams,
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.440]  I want you to for folks joining us and stations joining us,

[1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:08.240]  Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:18.480]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Mike Adams of naturalnews.com owns
[1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:22.200]  a major scientific testing lab special author researcher and
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:25.760]  other than somebody like Mercola, you have the dominant health
[1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:30.080]  expert in really the world of the United States. And he's here
[1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:33.840]  with us accurately the last five weeks chronicling that you
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:36.800]  don't see all hell breaking loose in China for something that
[1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:39.720]  isn't real. Now are they using it for power grab? Absolutely.
[1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:43.920]  But then you see other countries locked down and reporting
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:46.320]  hundreds and hundreds of deaths in Italy. And that's in the
[1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:50.280]  early stages. So mainline journals and things of the
[1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:52.560]  federal government, the Pentagon thinks it kills 2% of
[1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:55.960]  people. I'm hoping that suggests the you know, infirm and
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.360]  folks that are at the hospital. So that's a skewed number. But
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:00.960]  it's definitely not the flu. It's manmade. There's something
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:03.960]  big behind it. We said this five weeks ago, China covered it
[1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:07.440]  up. Months and months ago, they did their their their cover up
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:11.360]  failed. So Mike Adams, talk about the study that's an info
[1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:15.240]  wars.com and naturalnews.com alert pandemic projection model
[1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:19.000]  shows 2.16 million deaths in USA by July 4 of Trump doesn't take
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.640]  action. And what could come out of that what that action is and
[1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:26.560]  the type of social breakdown we're going to see and how bad you
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:29.920]  think it's going to get before we see action. So you've got nine
[1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:33.160]  minutes, run the tables on us, hit us with all barrels.
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:37.720]  All right, the the model is rock solid in terms of the math.
[1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:40.480]  When you look at the exponential spread of this, the model
[1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:44.080]  projects that if nothing is done to shut down travel, to have
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:48.400]  extreme social isolation across America, then by July 4 of this
[1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:52.760]  year, there will be 2.16 million dead Americans from this
[1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:56.200]  pandemic. If nothing is done to shut this down between now and
[1:07:56.200 --> 1:08:00.320]  then. Now, I call this these numbers I use very conservative
[1:08:00.320 --> 1:08:04.200]  numbers and are not value of only 1.82, which is maybe only a
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:07.440]  third of the real numbers. The number of cases doubling roughly
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:10.640]  about every seven days. That's the assumption of this model. In
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:15.000]  reality, we know it doubles maybe about every 3.5 days. So the
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.240]  real world case is way worse than this model predicts. However,
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:22.440]  there will be interventions. We're seeing it already. So in
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:25.280]  Washington state schools are being shut down. Employees are
[1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:28.160]  being sent home campuses are being emptied corporate campuses.
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:32.520]  That is actually the only answer right now. And so the
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:37.440]  implication of this model, which starts April 4, 580 total dead
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.080]  by that day, according to this model, by May 4, 10,000 plus
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:46.880]  dead by June 4, 153,000 dead by July 4, 2.16 million dead. The
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:50.440]  only way to stop that is through extreme isolation. So what's
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:53.680]  coming for America? And you can mark my words on this. Trump
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:57.600]  will declare a national emergency 100%. It will happen.
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:01.240]  There will be extreme severe restrictions on domestic air
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:04.920]  travel, road travel. There will be cities under quarantine.
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:08.360]  There will be roadside checkpoints in certain areas.
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:11.840]  There will be emptied universities, empty school campuses,
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:14.880]  corporates, corporations will send their employees home in
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:17.880]  massive numbers, much larger than anything you're seeing now.
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.120]  We are about to experience a shutdown of American society
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:28.200]  beginning around June, July, August. This is going to be the
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:34.200]  summer of hell in in America. And that's the only way to stop
[1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:36.680]  this and to recover and get on the other side. But there's
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:40.520]  another big problem here. If Trump doesn't act quickly enough,
[1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:45.200]  according to Dr. Fauci of the NIH, roughly 15 to 20% of the
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:48.680]  people who are infected will require hospitalization. The
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:51.440]  problem is we don't have enough biocontainment hospital beds in
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:54.400]  the United States. We only have a few thousand that have the
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:57.800]  containment facilities. We have about a quarter of a million
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.240]  open hospital beds that are not set up for, you know, BSL for
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:06.400]  level biohazard pathogens, but we don't have very many hospital
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:10.640]  beds that can biocontain people. As a result, the death rate
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:14.160]  will begin to spike if we have so many infections that the
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:17.360]  hospitals get overrun. And that will happen very quickly. That
[1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:21.520]  could happen as early as mid May or or yeah, that could happen
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:25.760]  in mid May, actually. Now this so so when that happens, then the
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:29.600]  death rate goes up to 10 to 15% as people are sent home to die.
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:33.480]  So I did not factor that into this model at all, which means
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:35.760]  these numbers are very, very conservative. The real numbers
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:39.200]  could be far worse. It could be five times worse in terms of the
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:44.160]  death rate. What the Trump the decision that Trump has to make
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:48.520]  is how much do you shut down society to stop the spread versus
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:51.480]  how much do you let society function to make sure people
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:54.160]  have food and medicine and fuel and the economy is still
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:57.680]  running. And this is the same decision that China's president
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:00.560]  had to make as well or Supreme Leader, whatever you want to
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:05.360]  call him, Emperor, the same decision and China has the
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:09.040]  ability to force people back to work at gunpoint. In America,
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:11.360]  we don't do that to our people, at least not yet. I hope we
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:15.200]  don't do that. So things are not, you know, we don't have the
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:18.560]  draconian controls because we are a more free society than
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:22.080]  China. Thank God, because communism sucks, right? And
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.200]  America is a lot more free than that. So it means that the
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:30.960]  president has very few tools to to force isolation, to force
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:34.520]  quarantines, or to even hope that people can get back to work
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:36.840]  at some point. You know, the American people are going to do
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:38.440]  what they want to do and companies are going to do what
[1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:41.000]  they want to do. Yeah, you can declare emergencies and you
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.880]  can, you can urge companies and people to do certain things,
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:46.200]  but we know that in America, people don't like to be locked
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:49.160]  down. So it's very difficult to imagine a scenario where
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:52.600]  people are respecting the quarantines. So you're going to
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:58.600]  see very bad compliance with quarantine orders in America,
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:03.800]  which makes the virus spread even more quickly. Thus, what
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:08.920]  we're realistically looking at here is an economic nightmare,
[1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:11.720]  an employment nightmare, a social nightmare, a law
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:15.240]  enforcement nightmare, a hospital healthcare nightmare,
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:20.040]  and on top of that, tens of thousands of dead people easily
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:25.320]  by this summer may be more. This is this is now inevitable,
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:29.080]  but it's going to look fine for the next six weeks, okay,
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:31.720]  because the numbers are very small for the next six weeks.
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:34.040]  This is the nature of exponential spread. So for the next
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:36.920]  six weeks or even maybe eight weeks, some people could say
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:39.000]  this is still no worse than the flu. Everything's going to be
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.240]  fine. It's going to disappear tomorrow. You're going to hear
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:45.000]  that for the next six weeks. Trust me that this is not the
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:51.480]  flu. This is so much worse and water clusters right now in
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:54.600]  Washington state and New York City and California, they will
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:13:00.040]  explode into full blown infestations or full blown
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:03.000]  outbreaks, you could say, in the subsequent weeks. Now,
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:06.040]  remember last week on the show, I came on and I said this week
[1:13:06.040 --> 1:13:09.240]  we're going to see and you can go back and quote me tens of
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:12.840]  infections this week and that's what we've seen. 10, you
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:15.800]  know, plus 10, plus 10, plus 10, plus 10, now up to 200.
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:19.880]  What's that? Plus deaths. Yeah, exactly, plus more deaths.
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:22.440]  Next week, we will see dozens of new infections. The week
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:25.320]  after, it'll be hundreds and then two to three weeks later,
[1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:27.320]  it'll be thousands and then it starts getting into tens of
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:29.960]  thousands and a few weeks after that, you're into hundreds
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:32.360]  of thousands and that's when the real hysteria starts
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.920]  because they've already set the table for hysteria. Let's
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:37.160]  bring in some wall cards though. All right. Clearly, it's
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:39.800]  more race specific. That's been confirmed. It's man-made.
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:44.040]  It targets Chinese and then derivation groups, Koreans and
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:46.680]  Japanese really bad. It's been killing Anglos and others as
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:49.400]  well and it's been killing a lot of folks in Italy and in
[1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:52.040]  Iran. So, there's something going on there. We could hope
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:54.440]  though that it's just race specific because that's that's
[1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:57.240]  sad but hopefully it won't spread too bad. I think we're
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.160]  going to be finding out very soon about this two percent
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:00.760]  model that the federal government and others have been
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:06.520]  saying that you're using in your conservative equations but
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:10.440]  if you look at the societal detonators of race war
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:13.960]  and the left and and and how the left and criminals
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:17.320]  use things for crises and use and crimes already exploding
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:20.360]  across the U.S. suddenly because the problems that this is
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:23.560]  already triggered. There's already runs on ammunition, runs on
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:27.640]  food. I mean, I see this as really a serious situation
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:30.440]  and Trump cannot during this emergency. I'm not even as
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:32.680]  worried about the quarantining. I'm worried about the left
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:35.400]  using it to blame Trump trying to overthrow the government
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:39.080]  and using the hysteria as the model for that and the Pentagon
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:41.560]  and the president and the Congress better not put up with
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.880]  you know Schumer saying we're going to go after Supreme
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:46.520]  Court people. You're going to get it. They're going to make
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:49.080]  their move and you can't let them make the move during this
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:53.080]  crisis. I'm telling you that's the issue. I agree completely
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:55.480]  if Trump needs to get on top of this ahead of this right away
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:58.520]  because he is being lied to right now by the CDC. There's no
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:00.840]  question about it. There's a headline on Drudge right now
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:04.200]  fewer than 2000 Americans have been tested to date. That is
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:07.080]  absolutely unacceptable. It's criminal. That tells you
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:09.160]  because you have a conservative model on this but on the real
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:11.320]  models we've been talking about privately that you're I mean
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:14.920]  then how many are infected right now? 50,000, 100,000, 10,000
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:18.680]  plus infected right now and I only modeled 600 plus infected.
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:21.560]  So it's way worse than the numbers I've already printed.
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:25.000]  It's way worse. I just dare not print them because it's a
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.480]  hypocrisy. And the former CDC head says they don't know what's
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:29.960]  wrong. They don't know why it's being intentionally botched
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:33.240]  because they're covering it up from the president to blame him
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:37.080]  when it explodes. This this is their next attempt to eliminate
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:39.960]  Trump. Russia failed impeachment failed. This is their next
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:42.360]  attempt. The CDC is trying to take out Trump. That's what's
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:45.240]  happening. Mike, thank you so much. Wow. Well, hope for the
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.880]  worst. Prepare. Hope for the worst. That's what the globalist
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:50.040]  hoped for. I hope for the best. Prepare for the worst. The
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:52.760]  globalists are hoping for the worst to try to overthrow
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:57.480]  America. It's it's just sick. Maybe not today. Maybe not
[1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:01.880]  tomorrow. But soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:31.560]  that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:34.760]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:38.920]  United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two
[1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:42.920]  left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S. had to
[1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:46.840]  save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:51.000]  The deep state began with World War one. The United States of
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:56.600]  Empire by James Dunn available at Amazon Books. Heart disease is

[1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:09.800]  drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:12.680]  few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:58.680]  Everybody needs food. I'm proud of selling high quality food.
[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:01.720]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble, this is
[1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.360]  something you need on your checklist to have done. But for
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:08.680]  me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:11.320]  I had long discussions this morning over an hour, long
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:13.400]  discussion with different individuals at different levels
[1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:16.120]  of this. Right now, the folks run the plants to get the best
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:19.080]  idea we have, but they want me to say six to eight weeks just
[1:18:19.080 --> 1:18:22.280]  so people aren't getting pissed. But understand the last food
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.320]  company, the biggest food company is now at hundreds of
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:28.360]  times their regular order and they were having discussions with
[1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:31.080]  me about stopping the promotion of food sales next
[1:18:31.080 --> 1:18:33.560]  week and at a certain point just saying we're done because
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:36.040]  people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks. We don't
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:38.600]  want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:40.440]  weirdness that comes with that because we're honest,
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:43.400]  under promise over deliver, but technically it's going to be six
[1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:45.880]  to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel
[1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:48.200]  like we took care of you so you come back again. We want

[1:20:11.320 --> 1:20:17.960]  We align ourselves with the truth. It's time. He aligns
[1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:21.800]  himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a
[1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:27.480]  side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:30.600]  Dr. Francis Boyle has been super accurate on my show for 20
[1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:33.640]  years. He wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Treatment.
[1:20:33.640 --> 1:20:35.720]  Stuff he was saying on the show five weeks ago is all come
[1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:42.360]  true. I've known Mike Adams 15, 16, 17 years and on this virus
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:44.520]  thing he's just been dead on and he's been very accurate over
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:47.400]  the years as well. He's a conscious guy. He's not trying
[1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:52.280]  to hype this and I see the other guest we have Professor
[1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:55.240]  Anthony Hall very respected. He's coming out basically saying
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:58.760]  the same thing. He's coming on next hour. We've had other
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:01.960]  guests on saying other things and believe me, I don't want
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:07.400]  this to be true. This is really bad news obviously. I think
[1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:10.520]  that we know it's very specific and we know that
[1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:12.280]  they're over sampling people that are already sick at the
[1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:15.640]  hospital. Most people don't go to the hospital. So, for those
[1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:18.520]  that go to the hospital who are so sick, two percent are
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:23.320]  dying. I mean, I really don't think it's two percent. But I
[1:21:23.320 --> 1:21:26.120]  think with the hysteria we've already seen in Europe and the
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:29.160]  hysteria we've seen in China and the fact that the left and
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:32.040]  the globalists have prepositioned this as Trump's
[1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:37.160]  water lube as his defeat that we've been totally dead on.
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:38.840]  They were planning to blend the president with this. I've been
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:41.320]  saying that for five weeks and here's Atlantic Monthly.
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:43.320]  They're the establishment globalist mouthpiece if there ever
[1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:46.040]  was one. The strongest evidence yet that America is
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:48.520]  botching coronavirus testing says the former head of the
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:51.960]  CDC. Well, there's not botching going on. It's being
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:55.240]  covered up. People go, oh, that's Trump's fault. Let me
[1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:57.800]  tell you, I got a great crew here. I got about a hundred
[1:21:57.800 --> 1:22:03.480]  people work here from warehouse to accounting to camera
[1:22:03.480 --> 1:22:05.800]  operators and researchers and journalists and everything
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:09.160]  else. If any of them decided to secretly not do what I
[1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:11.400]  said, they could wreck this place. But they're good
[1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:14.440]  conscientious folks. But to get above about a hundred people
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:17.960]  or units of that or platoons in the military, it starts
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:20.360]  breaking up. That's when things are always broken down to
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:24.680]  about a hundred people in the subgroups of ten. Trump does
[1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:28.520]  not, I mean, he doesn't know half the buildings in DC. Neither
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:32.840]  do I. And so this is not about attacking Trump. Trump better
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:36.840]  get out and get ahead of this. And as Buchanan said over
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:39.720]  a week ago, the globalism is what caused the spread. Trump
[1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:42.280]  shut down the flights from China. He got criticized for it.
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:45.240]  He's got to go on the offense and say, we hope it's not really
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:48.360]  bad, but we're going to be ready together. Only way he gets
[1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:51.480]  caught flat footed is if he says everything's fine, everything's
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:55.080]  okay. What you didn't say, he said the media is hyping it to
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:57.960]  a level that's a hoax. He didn't say the virus is a hoax.
[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:00.360]  And I can tell you the president is concerned about germs.
[1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:02.920]  He's always being a germaphobe. So there's a big article, just
[1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:06.360]  went up on infoworks.com in band.video. I hope you'll share
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:09.320]  this video needs to get out because it's a critical truth
[1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:11.720]  and a talking point to counter the globalist. Send it to
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:14.040]  whitehouse.gov. Send it to members of Congress because
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:16.280]  they listen to me, the people, they listen to info wars, the
[1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:23.160]  forbidden fruit. Coronavirus is globalism's death, not its
[1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:27.160]  rebirth. Here's the Greg Rees report.
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:36.920]  25% of the world's generic drugs are made in India. And India
[1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:43.240]  relies upon China for almost 70% of their active ingredients.
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:47.480]  Several of these Chinese sources have shut down due to the Wuhan
[1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:53.000]  coronavirus. And as a result, India has restricted exports of
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:57.080]  26 ingredients and the medicines made from them.
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:01.800]  The United States no longer produces its own medicine.
[1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:07.800]  How did this happen? In the 1990s, 90% of these fundamental
[1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:13.480]  ingredients were produced in the USA, Europe, and in Japan.
[1:24:13.480 --> 1:24:17.800]  But US laws on generic drugs began motivating companies to
[1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:23.720]  manufacture in China. The greatest win for China came exactly
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:30.520]  three months after 9-11. On December 11th, 2001, China joined
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:37.240]  the World Trade Organization, aka the WTO, and immediately began
[1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:41.320]  wiping out the competition in the American free market with
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:48.280]  unbeatable low slave labor costs. Within two years, the USA
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:53.160]  lost their last aspirin, penicillin, and vitamin C
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:59.000]  producers. Today, we depend upon China for about 90% of our
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:03.960]  medicine. China has already amassed a reputation for
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:07.800]  poor quality. And because they have monopolized the global
[1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:11.160]  market, the FDA has been forced to lower their
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:16.600]  manufacturing standards. The low standards in China are likely
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:19.960]  to blame, in part, for the many explosions at Chinese
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:25.560]  pharmaceutical factories that have caused global shortages.
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:30.840]  Recently, because of the Wuhan coronavirus, masks were ordered
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:35.800]  to not be exported from China. There are life-sustaining drugs
[1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:40.600]  that China is the sole supplier of to the US. What happens if
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:44.840]  China declares an emergency and shuts down all medical supply
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:49.160]  and drug exports, like both India and China are already
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:57.160]  beginning to do? If the WTO is the father of globalism, then
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:03.080]  the UN's insidious replacement migration is its mother.
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:07.560]  And in Italy, the man believed to be coronavirus patient zero
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:12.280]  is a Pakistani migrant who works in food delivery.
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:16.120]  After testing positive for the virus, he refused to self
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:20.680]  isolate and continued to deliver food. A recent video of
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:24.760]  migrants holding babies over fires to make them cry in order
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:28.840]  to deceitfully cross the border into Greece shows several
[1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:34.760]  people speaking Farsi. They are Iranian. Iran is currently
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:38.440]  suffering an outbreak of the coronavirus. Why on earth
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:43.240]  should Greece allow them in? The coronavirus appears to be
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:47.320]  some type of eugenics bio weapon designed to kill the weak
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:51.800]  and elderly. But one thing is for certain, it has already
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:57.000]  killed the philosophy of globalism. And now, it will be
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.920]  stress testing the precarious digital grid that our entire
[1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:06.440]  society is based upon. For Infowars.com, this is Greg
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:14.040]  Rees. That is first rate world class reporting. That's why
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:16.600]  Infowars is so precious and you keeping us on air is so
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:20.280]  amazing. And I thank you all. That report is posted to
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:26.040]  newswords.com. Infowars.com. Share it from Bandai video.
[1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:28.760]  Let's just put it this way. China was positioned to hold us
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:32.600]  by the shorthairs on medicine, on weapons parts, on
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:35.320]  components, on everything. In two minutes to midnight, Trump
[1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:37.560]  got in and said, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, the brakes. And now
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:40.360]  this happens. I think China did it on purpose. I don't think
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:43.240]  he got out of Wuhan on accident. No, this lets them clamp
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:46.280]  down there, use control, flood us, hit us, and then we're
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:49.960]  more dependent in our supply chain because we're dependent
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:53.240]  on them. And then you have the Islamists who probably
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:55.640]  intentionally contract it. In fact, I was told months ago by
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:58.520]  army sources that we're worried about jihadists getting
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:00.520]  really deadly viruses and bringing them in. Remember all
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:03.640]  that? That's all over the internet. This is right out of
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:06.280]  12 monkeys and then this Islamist comes in and suddenly
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:09.880]  it's all over Italy where this guy's making food deliveries.
[1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:12.760]  You don't think he just accidentally sneezed on a few
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:17.560]  people. No man, he was probably putting it into the food.
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:20.680]  Unbelievable. You don't think he just exploded everywhere for no
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:24.760]  reason. 12 monkeys, the guy flies around hypothetically in a
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:27.880]  plane and actually spread it. No, the way to do it would be
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:31.240]  get that into food delivery and then you jack all the food
[1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:39.480]  by. So obvious, ladies and gentlemen, good Lord.

[1:29:54.680 --> 1:29:59.560]  Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant streams of text
[1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:02.840]  messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying
[1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:06.600]  is coronavirus really deadly? How bad is it really? So I would
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:08.920]  encourage listeners, yes, go get high-quality, swarble foods.
[1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:10.920]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:13.240]  actually still has food. It does take five to eight weeks to
[1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:15.240]  get it to you because they got a package and they got the food.
[1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:18.200]  But I would encourage listeners to do the most important thing
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:20.760]  and that's drink purified water, that's a prey, that's get
[1:30:20.760 --> 1:30:23.000]  focused, that's not be stressed out because you're prepared

[1:30:57.960 --> 1:31:01.080]  globalists are in trouble. Humanities waking up to their
[1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:04.760]  tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how
[1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:07.560]  they're building a post human world. But we know they're
[1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:11.240]  going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to
[1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:14.600]  absolutely implode third world countries and then use those
[1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:18.600]  giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and
[1:31:18.600 --> 1:31:22.520]  overwhelm the west and collapse our social services in a giant
[1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:26.360]  clowered and pivot program. The UN also has said they'll use
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:30.040]  mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government
[1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:34.280]  inner coronavirus. This is a critical year and it's a
[1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:38.600]  critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word
[1:31:38.600 --> 1:31:42.360]  because people are waking up like never before but this fight
[1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:45.240]  against tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about
[1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:50.520]  band.video and info wars.com forward slash show that is so
[1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:54.840]  important. You are at the center of the resistance. You are our
[1:31:54.840 --> 1:31:58.920]  only hope. I also want to say that I'm happy to be uh uh
[1:31:58.920 --> 1:32:02.440]  helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the
[1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:05.960]  work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving
[1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:08.520]  into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of
[1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:11.400]  their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality
[1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:14.600]  and I say that from personal experience because I know that
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:17.480]  the products that are being offered here, I've tried them
[1:32:17.480 --> 1:32:20.680]  and I I use them every day and that power pack that they have
[1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:23.880]  the AMPM power pack. Well, I wouldn't be so energetic this
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:28.120]  morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that
[1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:30.680]  regard. I just wanted to start out by saying that because I
[1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:32.840]  think it's important to remember that beyond the
[1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:36.040]  theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to
[1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:38.360]  think about these great events in the world, one of the
[1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:43.000]  priorities has to be to take care of yourself remembering that
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:47.800]  our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for
[1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:50.680]  good purpose for our families and for our communities and
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:54.200]  right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are
[1:32:54.200 --> 1:33:14.280]  critical to the future of America.
[1:33:24.200 --> 1:33:43.960]  Make no mistake, they're getting ready to clamp down on
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:47.400]  already are in many parts of the world using this virus as
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:50.600]  the pretext but nobody's discussing its man made, the
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:54.360]  bio weapons labs that Obama transferred it to China. But we
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:58.120]  are and we're hammering. I'm going to go to some of your
[1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:00.760]  phone calls, Max and Mickey and Nick and others here in a
[1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:06.200]  moment. We'll open the phones up 877789 Alex, 8777892539 on
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:10.200]  this live Friday edition. Mainland Chinese media demands
[1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:12.920]  that's all state run an apology from the rest of the world
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:16.760]  for the sacrifice. China has made one of your 400 million
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:19.800]  girls you've killed your one child policy or maybe the
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:22.440]  hundred million that's coming as Chinese killed out of the
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:27.000]  womb of just men, women, children. Oh now they'll be the
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.680]  big heroes you see once we found out how bad it is. Although
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:33.720]  it came out of China, not a Wuhan and his man made and you
[1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:37.720]  bought it from the US under Obama. So here's that video.
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:44.120]  I'll read the subtitles. Back of it again. She's talking
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:48.680]  fast. I'm going to start over. Go ahead and go. He grounded
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:52.120]  1.4 billion people to guard the world against coronavirus and
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:54.600]  yet the Wall Street Journal is still not apologized for calling
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:58.680]  us the sick man of Asia. Living under immense ridicule.
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:01.720]  Only Chinese people are making tremendous. We yet the road
[1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:04.920]  is just too fast. I can't read it. I mean it's just it's just
[1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:08.760]  crazy. I can actually read you the transcript of it but
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:12.040]  that's the whole idea. No communist China is out of control.
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:18.120]  Its rich elites are leveraging their population in a takeover.
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:22.840]  That's what they're engaged in and
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:29.000]  when you first don't succeed try try again. I want to start that video
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:35.720]  and I want to just pause it on each frame so that I can
[1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:40.360]  read what she's saying. So let's just start it down. I'll read the first frame.
[1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:46.680]  We grounded 1.4 billion people. Yes a great police state, a great lockdown. It's
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:49.560]  the new virtue. Globalism will teach you to lock down all your
[1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:51.720]  cities. The globalists said this. It's in my film
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:55.640]  Endgame 14 years ago. Continue.
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:36:01.400]  Just to guard the world against coronavirus. Oh you were guarding the
[1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:05.640]  world. No you were bitching saying the U.S. wouldn't let your flights in.
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:08.680]  While you shot people at checkpoints everybody else grounded you. You were
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:10.920]  using as a weapon against the U.S. publicly.
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:14.200]  Two plus two equals four. Why would you demand your flights to come into us but
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:17.480]  nobody else. It's all part of your war against the U.S.
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:21.240]  with the dirty globalist. Continue.
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:26.440]  And yet the Wall Street Journal still is not apologized.
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:29.880]  Apologize for what? For calling you the sick man of Asia.
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:33.960]  Your country is completely out of control and abusive and evil and
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:37.720]  has millions of people in slave camps building Nike and
[1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:40.680]  Apple products but it's okay because Tim Cook's gay.
[1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:44.840]  For calling us the sick man of Asia. Continuing.
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:50.280]  Living under immense ridicule.
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:56.280]  We Chinese people are making tremendous sacrifice yet we are on the road.
[1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:06.600]  Of stirring solidarity around the world. That's right. You're the model
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:12.040]  of sterilization. You're the model of world government. You're the model of
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:16.680]  public execution. You're the model of no due process.
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:20.200]  You're the model of human animal clones. You're the model of mobile
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:25.560]  execution vans. You're the model like David Rockefeller said of all this evil.
[1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:29.240]  You're evil communist system and you're losing your war with America.
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:34.120]  You're political economic war and so now.
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:38.440]  Here comes the virus and you're the victim. Gadgets
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:45.160]  for tech giants made with coerced slave Chinese labor.
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:50.520]  Associated Press. Coerced. You live in a slave camp. You don't work to execute you.
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:53.880]  It's just coerced folks.
[1:37:55.160 --> 1:37:59.960]  But don't look for any Chinese Holocaust museums or the Chinese killed by the
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:05.400]  communists. Don't look for any Uyghur events.
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:11.480]  Because the left loves China and loves abusing people and loves slaves.
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:17.000]  And they've got them now. We're going to go to Max and Mickey and Nick and Trina
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:21.880]  and Jason and Jeremy and many, many others. Please remember that
[1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:25.160]  regardless of whether how deadly this virus is, regardless of it's just a
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.840]  little bit deadly, very low level death, whether it's super deadly, if it kills
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:33.400]  you, it's bad news. But whether this hype or not, this is a
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:36.120]  big move. It came out of China. It came out of the
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:39.880]  New World Order. It's man-made and they're going for broke with the plans
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:42.440]  they're going to use to destabilize the world with this and go out of the
[1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:45.800]  economy. And it's already happened and we called it here.
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:48.760]  So I would advise listeners just in your everyday life anyways to boost your
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:51.000]  immune system. And we have the products that do it.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:55.960]  DNA Force Plus has the PQQ, the CoQ10 and other cofactors and other

[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:19.000]  upload of the turmeric. People love it. It's anti-inflammatory nature.

[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:16.920]  infowarstore.com. Turbo force.
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:24.920]  Okay, let's do it. Let's go ahead and talk to Mickey in Arkansas.
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:29.000]  Mickey, thanks for holding her on the air. Hey, Alex, how's it going today?
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.360]  Man, I tell you, I just hope all these people I respect are wrong. I hope it's
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:34.840]  sitting as bad as it looks, but regardless, they're using it for a
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:38.040]  takeover. What do you think? Okay, I'll tell you what I think. Here's
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:41.080]  my question for you. I watch you and Mike Adams and Stuart
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:45.240]  Rosen and I'm retired ex-military and I really plan my lifestyle
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:49.480]  around what you guys say. I believe in y'all. I trust in y'all. God bless y'all.
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:54.040]  I'm prepared. I have stored up enough food for a year. I've stored up water. I've
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:57.400]  got a natural spring on my property. I've got weapons, ammunition. I'm
[1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:02.520]  trained. Boy, I wish I was with you. Okay, I've got it all going on,
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:05.480]  brother, but here's my question for you, Alex.
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:10.600]  I live in the northern town here in upper Arkansas in the mountains.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:13.640]  When do we know when it's time to start bugging out? I don't want to use the
[1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:17.560]  term self quarantine. I want to use the term self isolate.
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:20.280]  How do we know when it's getting time for us to just
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:24.120]  take it on our own to just bug out and get away from the world? If I was
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:27.800]  retired and didn't have to be in Austin, I would already be preparing the next
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:31.240]  few weeks to leave because it's exponential and so if it is as bad as
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:34.840]  they say and we hope it isn't, then I mean as soon as
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:37.560]  possible. Okay, well here's what I worry about when I
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:40.280]  watch your show. I try to take my cues from y'all,
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:44.360]  but I still see you sending Owen and Savannah and Millie and Caitlyn and all
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:46.680]  the amount to these rallies and conventions,
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:50.280]  and they're not wearing masks and it doesn't look like they're very prepared
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:53.960]  around thousands of people. Sir, I agree, but see right now it's
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:57.000]  such a small number. It's deadly, it spreads fast, but you're
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.640]  right. It's probably worse than they're saying, and we've actually had those
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:02.360]  discussions now. We're going to be watching very closely.
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  I mean, I've already canceled one trip, didn't tell people that, and I'm already,
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:08.920]  I mean, we're already having those discussions, so I mean, look, you're just
[1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:12.360]  as smart as we are, smarter. What do you think we ought to do?
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:16.680]  Well, I think if it's going to get as bad as what Mike says, and we're looking at,
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:20.760]  you know, maybe 3.2 million dead, if they have to go to these
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:24.280]  conventions and rallies, maybe it's time to start passing a few
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:27.880]  masked out, and you know, I'm already, I've got my
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:31.480]  mask, I've got a P95 mask with filtered respirators,
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:35.640]  and people make fun of me when I, even at my church, I wear my mask,
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:40.120]  and I told them this was my last Sunday at our church, so
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:43.320]  they know that Mickey's taking this serious.
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:46.840]  Well, listen, with all the crap in the air already, you know all the Chinese
[1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:50.200]  toxic waste just rains down over the Midwest from the jet stream. It's good
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:53.480]  to wear a mask sometimes. Anyways, sir, you've got more answers or as
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:57.160]  many as we do, and I'm listening to you. We always promote being prepared,
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:43:01.400]  having firearms, knowing how to use them, and maybe self-sufficient, and learn how
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:04.680]  to hunt, and learn how to garden. I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do.
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:08.280]  It feels good when we do it, but we do sell high-quality, swarovable food. I told
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:11.640]  my patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle? I said, I think it's gonna be
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:13.880]  really big, and they said, well, we can handle probably this, we're not sure,
[1:43:13.880 --> 1:43:16.840]  we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:19.080]  I said, no, I think this is gonna be huge. I think you should spend everything you
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:21.960]  have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:24.200]  So, those are the top discussions we have, and I'm just giving the inside
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:28.360]  base of all of this. This is a hundred times regular volume plus,
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:31.560]  was a hundred times a few days ago. Now, it's about 200 times, okay?
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:35.000]  At infowarstore.com, you go right in the queue, first come, first served.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:39.080]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra-massive, it's dizzying. I mean,
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:42.840]  this is just insane. We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe,
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:47.560]  and then, if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:51.160]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food, but that's how big this is.
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:54.040]  So, what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on.
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:57.720]  infowarstore.com. Rich in Alabama, Rich, thanks for calling.
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:03.800]  Hey, Mr. Jones, appreciate it. First thing, I love the turbo-force. I drive truck for a living,
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:08.520]  and it's amazing. Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end,
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:12.360]  but that turbo-force is amazing. How is turbo-force different than coffee?
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:20.200]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours. I don't fill the jitters like I do,
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:25.320]  drinking coffee, and it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:31.320]  I'll, you know, knock out to my mouth cold. Well, that's what we went out to a top developer
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:36.280]  who did want his name on it, and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10-hour energy be?
[1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:40.760]  Is that possible? That's good, and clean, and strong, and has a bunch of different forms of
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:44.920]  energy that are healthy and natural, that are time-released, and there's more money in it
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:50.120]  than anybody else puts in their product. So, that's why turbo-force has such a great effect,
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:56.120]  and so I really appreciate you, and I'm glad that you like turbo-force.

[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:11.240]  That's good. People need to be self-sufficient. The average person is living hand to mouth,
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:16.440]  paycheck to paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire. We need to reverse this trend

[1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:37.320]  You can hear it.
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:46.440]  I'm looking at these followers on the board. I'm going to chase them here in a moment.
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:55.720]  He says it all. That's what my God tells me. The virus is a cover for the hijacking of the Republic.
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:48:01.480]  That's what it is. It's the globalist striking back against the nation state.
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:09.320]  But it doesn't mean it's a hoax. But giving up our liberties and freedoms and setting a new
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:14.760]  precedent like 9-11 but leaving our borders open is not the way to go. I'm going to go back to
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:19.720]  your calls here in just a moment. I spent two segments on this last hour. I shouldn't have
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:24.920]  but it just it really captured my attention in a sickening way.
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:29.400]  Brian Williams, the guy that said he was shot down in a helicopter and a lot about it was
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:33.560]  almost a New York Times editor. The headlines New York Times editor and Brian Williams
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:37.960]  ameliorated ever suggesting each American could have received one million from Bloomberg's 500
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:48.040]  million ad spend. Now let's just pull back from that for a moment.
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:59.560]  You could give a million dollars to 500 people, not a million dollars to 327 million. Anybody knows that.
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:06.280]  Well, guess what? The New York Times and others have come out and defended themselves.
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:13.080]  So does the Washington Post. This is a Paul Joseph Watson article, blah, blah, math, blah, blah,
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:18.120]  close quote. Washington Post journalist responds to humiliating one million
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:21.240]  for every American fail because they were the one that first graded it saying
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:24.520]  the 500 million he spent, he could give every American a million dollars.
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:32.520]  500 million does not give 327 million people a million dollars. It gives 500 that. But they're
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:40.520]  doubling down. They say he could easily afford to give everyone in America a million dollars.
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:45.400]  That was their point, she says. Well, I knew that was her point. That's why I said without
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:52.920]  knowing that was their idiot point that if he has 78 billion dollars and you divide that by 327 million,
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:50:00.600]  it's 327 trillion dollars. There's not that much money in the whole world.
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:08.440]  So even with it, there's no end to these people, man. But that's why you people want to vote for
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:15.720]  Bernie Sanders because they just don't know math. They go, well, there's a guy's got a
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:21.560]  private jet and I need one. And then Sanders flies around on private jets, but then says,
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:26.280]  you're bad if you fly in first class. I mean, it's okay for him. He's a communist leader,
[1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:34.520]  though. He's got things to do. All right, I'm done. I said I'm going to your calls. I just,
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:39.480]  that's another article. Mob of teens savagely beat 15-year-old girl in New York. Of course,
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:44.120]  it's a racial attack. It's okay. It'll be covered up. We'll play that video coming up next hour.
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:49.320]  Medical report on America's first case of coronavirus revealed. China is the real sick
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:55.160]  men of Asia. We're going to get to all of it. But the last caller was a perfect caller because
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:51:01.960]  he's saying to me, when's the right time to do this? And he's saying to me, well, if it's
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:07.400]  as serious as some of your guests are saying, why aren't you doing something? And you know what,
[1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:11.800]  sir? I'm having that same discussion every day because I'm sitting there talking to my wife and
[1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:23.960]  I'm like, we're going to have to really look at this and I'm looking up to actuaries and
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:28.040]  within about two weeks or so, we're going to really know some of the numbers. And if it's as
[1:51:28.040 --> 1:51:31.880]  bad as they say, if two percent of people to get this die, yeah, I'm not playing Russian or love
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:36.440]  with my kids. And then I got to talk to my ex-wife and try to figure that out. And like, you know,
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:41.240]  which house do the kids want to quarantine at? They're with me most of the time. And it just,
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:45.000]  it turns into a nightmare. It's a nightmare situation. I got four kids, one with my new wife,
[1:51:45.560 --> 1:51:53.080]  three with my ex-wife. And I'm not going to wait around until a bunch of people are dying.
[1:51:53.080 --> 1:52:00.280]  I mean, because what I'm saying is, I could talk for a thousand hours on this. Look at you.
[1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:07.800]  We're down to decision time. My Adams has integrity and I respect my Adams and I respect Dr. Francis
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:11.880]  Boyle and I respect the next guest, Professor Anthony Hall coming up that just say this is an
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:16.440]  incredibly horrible scenario. And we know the supply chain nightmare is totally real regardless.
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:21.240]  And it's here. So this is definitely a big deal. Huge. You can feel it in your bones,
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:27.880]  not just intellectually see it. But I just don't believe that this new virus popped out of nowhere
[1:52:27.880 --> 1:52:31.720]  that's man-made. They'd released something that kills 2% of people. Because let me tell you something.
[1:52:31.720 --> 1:52:35.960]  The NIH and the chai comms and the globalists, they're not getting it. Let me tell you something,
[1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:38.760]  you get 3 million dead Americans or whatever the numbers are going to be,
[1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:46.280]  they're going to be some people getting hung if it's man-made. And the fact that it'd be obviously
[1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:51.000]  man-made and they admit it's man-made, but no one wants to talk about it. That's the elephant,
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:55.080]  the room. They'll never cover that up. They'll never hide that.
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:03.160]  This isn't a science fiction movie where the virus gets out. It's the real world.
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:08.760]  So let me say something. I know communism is horrible. I know Satan worship is real. I know
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:12.280]  the left loves to kill babies and it's a religion for them. I said it 20 years ago. Now they're
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:16.440]  public about it. I know thousands of things just like you do that are dead rock certain.
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:22.840]  But I don't know what's going on with this virus and I'm not going to sit there and tell you what
[1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:30.760]  you should do. It's that simple, but I would be boosting your immune system and I'd be getting
[1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:38.280]  right with God because regardless, this is a big move. All right, Jason says it's a cover for the
[1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:44.120]  hijacking of the Republic. Oh, it's that 100%. Who are the players? Who do you think's behind it?
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:50.200]  What do we do, Jason? Well, a few weeks ago, the World Health Organization came out and said
[1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:55.240]  that they wanted to, first of all, thank you for taking my call, but they wanted to put the UN
[1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:59.480]  in charge of all the quarantine centers around the world since it's a global pandemic.
[1:53:59.480 --> 1:54:04.360]  And remember, Trump said Americanism, not globalism is our credo. So I just wonder
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:10.440]  how this virus not only plays a fact of trying to affect us, but that I believe that's why the
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:16.520]  DOD or the military bases started to have all their quarantines put on the military bases
[1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:23.640]  to kind of out route that move by the who to put the UN on American streets and worldwide.
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:28.920]  Bingo, exactly. Man, that's why I love taking calls. You're absolutely right. You see Trump
[1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:35.880]  is outflanking him. He knows what's coming. Exactly. And so I think the day that the VA
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:41.560]  gun rally went on, the globalist cracked their pants when they seen all those American arms
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:47.400]  peacefully and it shows that their dystopian future of no guns don't kill people, people kill
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:52.360]  people, and you guys are crazy. And God forbid we give you guys any guns. Oh my God, this guy needs
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:57.480]  a show. I'm going to start that show soon with the podcasters. Get Jason's name and numbers,
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:01.800]  Jason, because you just crystallized everything. You're right. And they got even the mother Jones
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:06.360]  said there was 30,000 40,000 people guns. Nobody got hurt. It was a diverse crowd.
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:11.000]  The leftists themselves melted down and said, maybe we should all have guns. They were even
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:16.600]  they didn't even know how to compute it. So now they're trying to project that fear that they had
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:21.640]  on us. And when you show that footage yesterday of Costco and their workers put in the toilet paper,
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:26.120]  they're like, bullcrap, this is the American spirit. We know what's going on. And we're taking
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:30.840]  back our country. This is a war and it's hot. And if we have to lose people, God forbid,
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:37.000]  look at the Russians that lost 20 million people, 10 million people. 22 million or 22 million.
[1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:42.040]  But I'm not ready to give up my way of life. No, I agree. We're not giving our guns up. We're not
[1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:46.680]  going to be good little chai comms. Exactly. And because it's not going to save people. Anyways,
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:51.160]  I agree with you. We need to then say what's reasonable and what will we not put up with?
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:56.040]  I know this. If you're up in some rural area and some government comes and says they need your food
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:59.800]  of their guns, their criminals, they're unlawful. We should be discussing right now with Joel
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:04.840]  Skelzen and others. When this all goes down, if it is as bad as we think it may be, what the rules
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:08.760]  of engagement are. I just know this. You're not coming to my house and taking my stuff. It's not
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:15.000]  happening. Ronald Reagan said the scariest words in the English lexicon is I'm here from the government
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:22.200]  and I'm here to help. I believe that. Damn right. So what's your gut on the virus? I mean,
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:25.960]  obviously it's a power grab. Obviously it's a globalist move. As you said, that's admitted now
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:30.120]  that the left's all scripting and saying it's all Trump's fault and saying, oh, what's going
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:34.600]  to happen with guns in America? Checkpoints. What's their next move? And what do you think Trump should
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:40.360]  do? I cannot say I understand their mindset because they are evil and they're Satanist. They kill
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:45.320]  babies. I don't know what their next thoughts are, but I tell you this much. We need to stand with
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:49.320]  our president and we need to stand with our neighbor. Get to know your neighbor, get to know
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:55.160]  your area. And at the same time, just be more loving. I hate to say it like that, but what's
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:56:59.960]  going to help us is God. Period. No, I agree with you on the grocery store the other night,
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:05.960]  and people are all being mean and hateful and it was weird. Everybody's filled with hate because
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:11.880]  we watch the television and what is it? It's tell live vision. They tell lies to our vision. So
[1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:17.000]  seeing is believing. And if they're not telling you the truth, like, hey, this is a bio weapon,
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:22.200]  then guess what? You're falling into their trap. I love them for wars because Jason, don't hang up.
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:25.000]  I'm going to let you host the next five minutes because I've got this rule now.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:28.360]  All the callers are amazing with callers like you that are on fire. I want you to come in,
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:32.200]  you're gonna host five minutes. We've got our guests coming on, but I'll continue with your calls
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:37.640]  after that. And I'm a host a little bit into the fourth hour and then Dr. Dick baggage can't wait
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:42.200]  to get his expert take. You know about a trailblazer fourth hour. Nick baggage stay with us hour number
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:51.480]  three straight ahead. This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales
[1:57:51.480 --> 1:57:58.120]  pitch. I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work
[1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:03.800]  that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is. And
[1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:11.320]  then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[1:58:11.320 --> 1:58:16.280]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen,
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:21.240]  fluoride's the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:28.920]  so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine,
[1:58:28.920 --> 1:58:36.040]  atomic iodine. We've got it back in stock X2 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling

[1:58:42.600 --> 1:58:48.840]  You can't lose unless you don't take action. I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love
[1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:53.080]  tuning in to Owen Schreuer. I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:59.960]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think
[1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:04.600]  you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're barely
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:08.600]  paying the bills here and I want to expand the face. The globalists not contract. I don't want
[1:59:08.600 --> 1:59:14.280]  them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee from me. We sell enough product, we'll have less
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:19.000]  ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run for their money. But we've
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:24.280]  got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus X2. These will change your life. Go
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:28.040]  check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration, check it all out.
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:32.200]  Whatever you do, take action and know be part of the second American Revolution. Be part of
[1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:37.160]  crush the globalist and get great products at the same time. infowarstore.com is the umbrella site.

[1:59:49.880 --> 1:59:52.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:52.600 --> 2:00:09.880]  Don't act so surprised, globalist. Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:18.680]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:25.880]  Who are what started the Wuhan Coronavirus epidemic? A lot of folks are saying people I respect.
[2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:30.440]  The best thinking out there has been put out by Professor Anthony Hall. He's coming up next
[2:00:30.440 --> 2:00:34.920]  segment. We'll also continue after that with your calls. The articles up at zero heads.com.
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:39.960]  It's also on info wars.com and it's big. It's lengthy. It's got a lot of documentation. We'll
[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:45.000]  be talking to him in just a moment. But you are on fire, Jason, in New Mexico. So we got about
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:49.960]  four minutes left of the short segment. Got a 10 minute segment coming up next. What other
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:55.720]  points would you like to make? Well, one point that I would like to make is back in November,
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:01:01.960]  there was an article that came out about Chinese police like touring or not touring, but walking
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:07.960]  around with Italy's police and a few other police forces around the world so that they could help
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:13.400]  others with our excuse me, help with their Chinese tourism. And then all of a sudden you have
[2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:18.280]  the outbreak in Italy. Then once again, the Defense Minister of China met with the Defense
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:24.360]  Ministers of Iran. And now there's an outbreak in Iran. But the one key thing was about when you
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:30.200]  had the guest on that spoke about the military games in Wuhan, China, and how all these things
[2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:36.200]  could be passed off. This is definitely an operation. Now, not to say that it's not serious,
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:41.240]  but it's been in the works. And I believe the killing of Soleimani was something that was
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:47.080]  very, very deep. And maybe they were planning a bio weapons attack. And once again, Trump
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:52.920]  trumped them in all pun intended. So I don't know, I know people are dying. But remember,
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:57.720]  China has the great firewall of China. So when I started seeing all of that footage
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:03.400]  coming out of China, I'm like, wait a second, China doesn't let anything out or anything in,
[2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:08.120]  but there's an influx of all this. They were allowing all the hysteric video,
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:11.560]  real stuff happening, but obviously being directed the shooting of it. Why would they
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:18.520]  want maximum fear? Because fear is the greatest motivator. I can scare you into doing things.
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:22.440]  If there's a consequence of punishment, same reason why we pay taxes, because nobody wants
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:26.840]  to go to jail. You know what I mean? But it's a totally voluntary system. Nevertheless, that's
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:33.000]  another topic. But if we can see people falling over, here's the reality. I believe it's mixed
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:38.600]  with the 5G weapon. You had the guest on talking about, you guys broke it open, showed that it's
[2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:45.480]  a weapon. When these people fall over, that seems like it's a direct attack from not just a bio weapon,
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:51.240]  but obviously it's a bio weapon, but it's the 5G system. There's no coincidences. I don't believe
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:59.320]  in such. Yeah, some similarities of thoughts and actions, but we're at war. There's casualties to
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:05.720]  war. And who doesn't mind killing their own people? China. In fact, China said famously,
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:10.280]  Mao Zedong and others said, we'd love a nuclear war. We're the only country on the earth that would
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:14.440]  like to get rid of our people. They've aborted, reportedly, 400 million people, most of them
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:20.200]  girls. That's their own number. Very interesting. All right. Well, Jason, thank you so much. And
[2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:23.240]  we are going to start. I keep saying we're going to do it. We're trying to hire more board operators,
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:28.280]  more crew, common short shows, basically every day that have a staple of, say, 30, 40 collars
[2:03:28.280 --> 2:03:32.600]  that we know are really awesome. That'll kind of schedule each hour that come in. And then we also
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:36.200]  open the regular phones with you. That's kind of the model I want to go to. Because some of these
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:41.320]  collars are amazing. Thank you so much, Jason. It's not for lack of collars, too. You know,
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:46.600]  one time we had a three hour show, 24,000 calls come in. And we've got that. That's the problem,
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:50.120]  actually, is so many great collars trying to get on. That's why most of them, I say,
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:54.440]  only first time collars this time to hear all these amazing people. So thank you so much, sir.
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:58.840]  Jeremy says CDC tech companies prepping for quarantine. You know, we're going to get to
[2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:05.160]  you. Atrina, Alaska, the virus related to 5G. People keep bringing that up. Joseph in Ireland,
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:09.640]  who's been holding, we'll get to you. The virus, China, globalist plan. Jeff, don't believe the
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:15.160]  hype on the virus. Iran related, we're going to get to you. Max in Wisconsin, the virus preparing.
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:20.920]  But for the next few segments at least, we've got our guest, who is a really smart individual
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:25.560]  that will tell you about when we come back on the other side, Professor Anthony Hall, again,
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:32.200]  news wars.com demonized attack lied about because they're scared of the fact there is no filter.
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:36.760]  We have a diverse group of guests and collars, and we have a real college of discussion here,
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:41.640]  trying to brainstorm into what's really going on. That's why you'll hear opinions from hour to hour
[2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:46.280]  minute to minute that are countervailing to the other, because that's where you get the real
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:57.160]  understanding is in debate. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones. Across the western world, from high
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:05:04.840]  school to college sports to even the Olympics, men, biological men are winning almost all of the
[2:05:04.840 --> 2:05:12.440]  sporting events. This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away,
[2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:17.640]  all in the name of the liberalism and openness. And then every day, I have stacks of news articles,
[2:05:17.640 --> 2:05:23.960]  just like today, UK team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender,
[2:05:23.960 --> 2:05:30.520]  and it hurt their feelings. UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:38.520]  1000 pound fine, because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty. That's the thought
[2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:44.360]  police. If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:49.320]  This is tyranny. These people are bullies, and it's sick, and it's evil, and it's part of a
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:06:12.200]  scientific anti human takeover. Resist it, speak out against it. American Herald Tribune,
[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:20.600]  the site, matches the initials of the professor, Anthony Hall, an editor in chief American Herald
[2:06:20.600 --> 2:06:26.840]  Tribune. He's a professor of globalization studies and liberal education university of
[2:06:26.840 --> 2:06:31.480]  Lethland Bridge, where he's now professor emeritus, the focus of Dutter Hall's teaching, and it goes
[2:06:31.480 --> 2:06:36.760]  into a community service campaign. Professor Hall has published widely in the area of expertise,
[2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:43.400]  including the aboriginal treaties, international law, colonization, some other areas we don't have
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:50.520]  time to get into. He has responded proactively to the incursions of those targeting his academic
[2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:54.040]  topics on their quest to limit academic freedom at university. He's his current schedule and
[2:06:54.040 --> 2:06:59.560]  research publication is aimed at bringing to light deeper analysis, the great topics that his
[2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:06.600]  detractors have targeted him for. That's what I always do. What I get targeted for, what they
[2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:13.880]  try to shut down, is what I then focus in on, because that's what they don't want you to look at.
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:19.880]  So he's written a big report that's up at ZeroHedge.com. It's also on M4s.com. Who are what
[2:07:19.880 --> 2:07:24.520]  started the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic? And how bad is it going to get? And what does he
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:29.160]  think is really behind it? So professor, Anthony Hall, thanks for coming on with us. And we've
[2:07:29.160 --> 2:07:33.560]  got like nine minutes left of the segment. I'd like to give you the floor to lay out what you
[2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:39.800]  currently think is happening and what's coming. Well, thank you, Alex. The idea that when you're
[2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:45.720]  being attacked for delivering an idea or an investigating something, that might be a sign
[2:07:45.720 --> 2:07:54.200]  that you're on the right track. And I noticed the, I've never seen such a plethora, such an
[2:07:54.200 --> 2:07:59.720]  influx of the allegation that, oh, there are these people out there doing conspiracy theorists.
[2:07:59.720 --> 2:08:06.120]  And, you know, the mainstream media, the usual suspects, the cabal, have really grabbed onto
[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:12.520]  that phrase in this particular situation. Now, isn't it interesting that the sort of martyr
[2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:22.360]  of this situation, Dr. Lee Wenliang, who died on February the 7th and was trying to draw attention
[2:08:22.360 --> 2:08:29.880]  to this new disease, he had to go into security police. He was told to stop spreading rumors,
[2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:37.080]  to stop making trouble. And, and he had to sign some kind of document. Well, isn't he, in a sense,
[2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:42.920]  being called a conspiracy theorist? In our terms, you know, you're accusing the government of things.
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:48.200]  A thought criminal, a thought criminal. Yeah. And, and of course, the Western media
[2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:53.960]  appointed him and say, oh, those pathetic Chinese, they're accusing this person. And it turns out,
[2:08:53.960 --> 2:09:00.440]  he was right. And so how many of these conspiracy theorists in the West, which are being dismissed,
[2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:07.080]  are in fact, on to something, are criticizing power in a way that power doesn't want. So,
[2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:14.680]  this topic, you know, captured my attention. I worked on this paper for three weeks, and, you
[2:09:14.680 --> 2:09:23.880]  know, had to learn a lot of new language like bio weapons, biotechnology. China is very emphasizing,
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:33.080]  it's very powerful in the area of biotechnology, which it's connecting to artificial intelligence.
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:43.240]  Anyway, there is much evidence that the source of the virus, the disease, the illness is not,
[2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:53.880]  you know, a bad batch of bat soup in the Wuhan market. It's a level four research laboratory
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:10:00.840]  into pathogens, the most high level type of laboratory in the world. There's one in Canada,
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:07.800]  in Winnipeg, and there's a tie into this story. So, people are saying, like your guest, Francis
[2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:15.800]  Boyle, it's the obvious explanation would be that this disease, that this illness, escaped in some
[2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:22.920]  way from the biological laboratory. But then when you get into what's going on in China,
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:31.240]  there was and is this protest in Hong Kong. And it's not in the article, but my sources in China
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:38.360]  are telling me, one explanation is there was a faction in the Chinese Communist Party that wanted
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:46.280]  to sick this disease on the protesters in Hong Kong, who are protesting the Chinese Communist
[2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:53.640]  Party, which has been in power since 1949, which is a kind of a very monolithic form of power.
[2:10:53.640 --> 2:10:59.080]  Of course, there's not a two-party state or a three-party state in China. There's a one-party
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:04.440]  state which has had the power since Mao. That's right. And Trump and the rest of the world has
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:09.480]  challenged it. And magically, the the Indian Institute of Scan the virus, it's man-made.
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:14.680]  Magically, it just pops up, shuts down the Taiwanese opposition, lets Xi Jinping clamp down,
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:23.000]  and now, magically, it's set to try to topple the West. Yes. Now, I don't claim to have the
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:32.920]  ultimate answer. Now, I see that display on the screen here from the uncanny presence of HIV.
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:40.040]  I was touched when I saw a clip of you, Alex, where you were saying, well, I initially
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:48.600]  saw this coronavirus thing as a kind of deep state diversion and an excuse to bring in different
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:58.840]  policies. But when you saw that the HIV virus is found to be in this. Yeah, welded in. Bio weapon.
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:04.600]  Yeah. Big pardon. Welded in. I mean, they admit it's just cut into it. It's just swapped onto it.
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:15.000]  And now, when they're treating the ill people, they're using HIV remedies and Ebola remedies.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:22.040]  So so this is increasingly the evidence is increasing that this is a human made
[2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:28.120]  bio weapon and that it has all the signs in the way the bio weapon is constructed. And now,
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:34.600]  it's supposedly mutating into a S and an L. And the L is more lethal.
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:39.640]  Oh, that's another point. I'm glad you brought it up. The Chinese government's now saying,
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:44.760]  this isn't even the US. I'm glad you raised that there's another more deadly variant of it.
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:53.320]  Yeah. So so there is a great deal of literature and, you know, things we could go into great
[2:12:53.320 --> 2:12:59.560]  detail about how it seems the Chinese are some faction within the Chinese are responsible for
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:05.400]  this. But then, of course, there is the story of the military games, which took place in late
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:12.040]  October. And this opens up the possibility that there is some kind of US dimension to this.
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:16.440]  And, you know, the United States, you've got to be honest, we're in a war with them. It's
[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:22.840]  very specific. And then there's a UN slash US games. What it was in Wuhan, wasn't it? And then
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:28.840]  now this pops up there was in Wuhan. And and of course, then there's this Harvard professor,
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:35.640]  Charles Lieber, who is arrested very publicly arrested for all the work he's conducting,
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:41.800]  basically in the chemistry department. He's head of the chemistry department with a specialty in
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:51.000]  virology, nano virology. And so he was working closely with the Wuhan technological university.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:58.280]  And so he has been arrested for that. So there is this US dimension to it. And given that the
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:03.880]  United States and China that the business class was about to say, there's different factions.
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:10.360]  And it's clear, a globalist US faction with the chai comms pretty much had already handed this out
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:15.080]  before for plausible deniability. And now they've released it to the embarrassed Trump. And before
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:21.480]  right before you came on, this broke, we'll come back and talk about this. Pompeo came out today
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:27.560]  and slams China in perfect coronavirus data for putting us behind curve. We were warning Trump,
[2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:32.200]  hey, they're going to blame you for trying to talk this down as your advisors. Now we know Trump's
[2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:35.640]  pissed at them. I was already told this by folks in the White House. So I go, oh, sir, they lie.
[2:14:35.640 --> 2:14:39.480]  That's why we told you it wasn't a problem. But they've clearly tried to set Trump up
[2:14:39.480 --> 2:14:43.080]  Atlantic monthly and others. So this is getting really sophisticated.
[2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:50.920]  Yeah. And so to think it it is, you know, China as a monolith, US as a monolith,
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:58.280]  hey, the elites of both societies have been interacting a lot. It's faction wars. It's
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:07.080]  faction wars. Yeah. Yeah. So so so to imagine it as a Chinese plot or a US plot, and the two
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:10.840]  are mutually exclusive. Let me stop you, Professor. I've been interrupting as you're so on target.
[2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:14.280]  And we'll give you the floor. We come back. You're a professor of globalism. You study the
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:18.520]  interaction of governments and systems. So we come back, explain as an expert in this,
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:22.600]  the different factions and what's happening. Because now you can see the scripting we said
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:27.000]  five weeks ago, probably an attack on America, probably an attack on the recovery, probably
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:31.880]  a chai-com event. But working with Western elites who would have to agree in committee
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:35.640]  with the chai-coms to do this because that's how communists operate. Professor Anthony
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:41.800]  Hall, ahtribune.com is our guest. We really appreciate him joining us. Others, Balasarra
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:49.000]  Sun just met him last week. We'll be right back on the other side infowars.com tomorrow's news today.

[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:20.040]  we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:24.520]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location. And rather than move it back
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:28.920]  to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable

[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:01.240]  and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:05.880]  keep running rough shot over him, everybody. I mean, I've got a problem and we'll just take
[2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:09.720]  the Trump rallies over. That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:15.800]  launched yet. We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers,
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:20.920]  impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowarstore.com,
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:24.120]  and it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth,
[2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:28.280]  you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things. People say,
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:32.440]  why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well, we're being censored and, you know,
[2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:35.720]  Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think,
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:41.400]  because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:47.240]  repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound of all
[2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:51.640]  silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:20:07.720]  Silence. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:35.080]  All right, Alex Jones here, back to my professor. Anthony Hall is a professor of globalization
[2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:39.560]  studies and a bunch of other things, but he's really been popular a long time. I was
[2:20:39.560 --> 2:20:44.120]  already familiar with his work years ago, but he's been all over the place going through,
[2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:48.280]  kind of organizing the things that are admitted and confirmed and predicting what's coming next.
[2:20:48.280 --> 2:20:53.560]  And look, Mike Adams is really smart. And so is Dr. Boyle, who authored the U.S.
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:59.560]  Biological Weapons Law that became the UN treaty in large part. But it's all theoretical. You're
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:04.040]  hearing all this a month ago, five weeks ago, and I'm like, okay, and I got other guests don't
[2:21:04.040 --> 2:21:07.560]  say it's not going to happen because I'm trying to hedge my bad time. I mean, usually I'm pretty
[2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:12.120]  accurate at stuff, but not when it comes to this. The huge response by the Chinese, though,
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:15.960]  whether it's real or not, is to create a global hysteria. That's clear. The cut off our supply
[2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:19.720]  lines. And that's happening. So this is, in my view, modern warfare. But at the time we
[2:21:19.720 --> 2:21:22.200]  have in this segment, professor, without me interrupting, because you made a lot of great
[2:21:22.200 --> 2:21:29.080]  points and I jumped in. Now you've got Pompeo coming out saying, oh, we did have a big enough
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:34.360]  response because China lied to us about about how bad it was. We've been critical of Trump saying,
[2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:38.280]  hey, you better get out ahead of this. So have you. So can you speak to that now? This is a
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:45.720]  pretty big development. Yeah, well, the Chinese response after they got through the initial
[2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:53.960]  denial stage has been enormous. And the spectacle of watching the Chinese build two hospitals in
[2:21:53.960 --> 2:22:02.040]  10 days or something, this has been something fantastic to perceive. The Chinese, let's be
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:07.480]  very clear that the Chinese government is on the line here. They've lost a lot of credibility with
[2:22:07.480 --> 2:22:15.720]  their own people. And they could lose the power over China. China could have a very different
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:23.880]  future than what the past has been since 1949. Then we go to US where there is supposedly
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:30.680]  this proper response. And I've been listening to true news, Rick Wiles on true news,
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:36.280]  they do a very good report every day on coronavirus. And like in the Seattle area,
[2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:41.240]  for instance, you see a couple of kind of pathetic little sheds that they're going to call
[2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:49.880]  quarantine spots. And there doesn't seem to be kits available. And the US response seems weak.
[2:22:49.880 --> 2:23:00.440]  Now, might the pharmaceutical companies want to build up the virus to decimate the United
[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:10.200]  States a bit more? Might the CDC have an interest in making the virus worse in the United States?
[2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:16.760]  It seems to me this is another agenda. What's wrong with the US approach to it? It's nothing
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:23.000]  like the Chinese approach. And we're being told, you know, relax. It's not going to be that big a
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:29.160]  deal. And yet we hear about 3.5 billion masks being ordered. Anyway, what's going on in the
[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:36.760]  United States? This is this is a huge issue. And Trump could be getting some bad advice
[2:23:36.760 --> 2:23:45.000]  and could be captured by Cabal that he shouldn't really be listening to is Pence really the right
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:52.360]  person to be heading up this whole government initiative. And so to add to the complexity,
[2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:59.480]  let's just throw in eugenics here. Alex, I have to say that over the years, I've been following you
[2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:05.160]  too, of course. And when I first heard you on eugenics, I thought, well, it's a bit extreme.
[2:24:05.160 --> 2:24:13.640]  But you did over time convince me that this is a very major trajectory. And there is Bill Gates,
[2:24:13.640 --> 2:24:22.120]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with the event 2001. He's all over eugenics. He's a key player
[2:24:22.760 --> 2:24:30.840]  in it. So there could be many agendas, just like 9 11. There are could be many factions
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:38.120]  cooperating in a different way. 9 11 raises the idea that if we don't get a handle on this at the
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:44.280]  beginning, if we don't find out what the true origins are, if the people who made it happen
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:49.880]  take over the response to the event, you know, then we're we're we're in trouble. We're in massive
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:54.120]  trouble. We have an entire gayly and dialectic captured by the group that creates the crisis,
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:59.240]  offers a solution, and then carries out the solution. That's exactly what we see happening
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:04.120]  here now. And you're an expert in globalism. Explain to folks how I know the audience
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:08.440]  understands this, but some of the listeners may not. It's not like there's the Russian government or
[2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:11.880]  the US government or the Chinese government. There are corporate governmental factions that all
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:17.080]  work. And that's how people divide themselves. There's a probably seven, eight, nine, 10 factions
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:21.160]  in the CIA that I've seen for myself, just covering it, them fighting with each other,
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:25.000]  came out in the church committees. So explain that because we've got globalists clearly working
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:30.040]  with China, but we can't say that somebody might not have got mad about China, what they're doing,
[2:25:30.040 --> 2:25:34.200]  and release this to bring down China. I mean, the point is something big's happening.
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:41.240]  Well, you talk about the church committee, which was a response to Watergate. And that's a long
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:48.840]  time ago. That's the 1970s. Since 9 11, we don't get government investigations, proper investigations
[2:25:48.840 --> 2:25:54.120]  on anything really. We, you know, we get all this false flag terrorism, we're given an explanation,
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:26:01.880]  and just turn the page. So yes, of course, you know, to think that there's a country called Russia,
[2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:06.040]  a country called China, a country called the United States, country called Iran,
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.920]  a country called Israel, and that everybody is under a certain tent subject to, you know,
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:15.880]  the sovereignty of those countries. The world doesn't work that way anymore, especially since
[2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:22.200]  9 11. Since 9 11, there's kind of been pseudo law brought in. We don't really have laws like we
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:28.280]  understood in the past, innocent until proven guilty and that kind of thing. So I'm at the stage
[2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:35.560]  where I'm trying to identify different scenarios, different factions without saying conclusively,
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:43.160]  it's this one or that one. Exactly. You're looking at the factions and who has motives and who might
[2:26:43.160 --> 2:26:51.480]  be behind it. That's the first thing to look at. And then how one faction can complement,
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:59.560]  can create an aspect of the agenda. And then another faction can kind of pile on and manipulate it.
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:06.200]  For instance, I find it quite credible that there was a faction within the Chinese Communist Party
[2:27:06.200 --> 2:27:11.080]  that said, we don't like these Hong Kong protesters. They're making us look bad. It goes on month
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:19.720]  after month. What about if we send a biological weapon that in that direction? So no, I think
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:23.880]  that's what happened. I think China is the main culprit because it changes the subject. How did
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:28.760]  Redidare blow up oil wells that run fire? They'd be on for months, burning millions of dollars.
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:34.120]  They couldn't put them out. He figured out how to send an explosive and detonate it, get rid of
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:40.440]  the oxygen and stop the fire. Well, that's I think China did a controlled detonation like Redidare
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:45.800]  of an oil well to change the subject to have a reset and then push a bio weapon of the U.S. at
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:54.280]  the same time. Yeah, well, I wouldn't be as quick to let the U.S. off the hook. I'm not letting
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:28:00.360]  it off. I'm just saying, looking at who stands to gain, China's organized response up front
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:04.600]  and the PR, I'm just saying that's my prime suspect. I agree with you. We should look at factions in
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:12.360]  the U.S. Well, it wasn't an organized approach up front. It was denial up front. And then when
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:19.880]  they were caught in the denial by Dr. Lee, then they went into, you know, hyperdrive. Professor,
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:23.480]  you're right. Let's talk about that then. And what you think's coming next, because I know
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:26.840]  you've been talking about people that need to know this is probably pretty serious. How bad
[2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:31.720]  do you think from all your research, the virus really is? And what should people be doing with
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:37.880]  the man that heads up a h tribune dot com? I'm Alex Jones. I had up news wars dot com info wars

[2:31:01.400 --> 2:31:04.760]  great to be back once again, and I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a
[2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:09.080]  shout out for your part. So that's super blue Florida free toothpaste and that super blue
[2:31:09.080 --> 2:31:13.320]  whitening toothpaste is on another level. I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and
[2:31:13.320 --> 2:31:18.040]  then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum. It is by far the best product that I've
[2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:21.880]  ever used in my life. I literally just took turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[2:31:21.880 --> 2:31:26.600]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and the back surgery and that body has made me feel better
[2:31:26.600 --> 2:31:30.440]  than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life. So I just want
[2:31:30.440 --> 2:31:34.360]  to get that out of the way. Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about
[2:31:34.360 --> 2:31:39.160]  Bohemian Grove. Nobody knew about FD. Nobody knew about Bilderberg. Nobody called 911 before
[2:31:39.160 --> 2:31:43.800]  it happened in July 2001. Go look it up yourself. Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want
[2:31:43.800 --> 2:31:47.400]  us off the air without you or not here. But yeah, these are all great products. So thank you, sir.
[2:31:53.880 --> 2:31:58.520]  Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and
[2:31:58.520 --> 2:32:04.120]  family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly? How bad is it really? So I would
[2:32:04.120 --> 2:32:07.880]  encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality swirable foods. We have the only company, the biggest
[2:32:07.880 --> 2:32:11.240]  in the nation that actually still has food. It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you
[2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:15.080]  because they got a package and they got the food. But I want to encourage listeners to do the most
[2:32:15.080 --> 2:32:19.080]  important thing and that's drink purified water. That's pray. That's get focused. That's not be
[2:32:19.080 --> 2:32:23.960]  stressed out because you're prepared and that's get DNA force plus the PQQ and CoQ 10 that cleans

[2:33:06.920 --> 2:33:21.160]  All right. We've got some great colors here.
[2:33:24.200 --> 2:33:28.680]  We've got a lot of great questions for our guests. Charles in Seattle says senior centers
[2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:33.000]  and shut down in Washington for coronavirus. That's not on the news, but that's big.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:37.960]  We've got Jeremy in Texas, CDC tech companies prepping for quarantine, Terry in Montana.
[2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:44.520]  Trina's been holding a long time ago. Trina virus connected to 5G. She has the question.
[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:49.000]  We got so many colors. We're gonna go to you, but I've got all this other insane footage.
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:55.480]  Bizarre statements are just flooding out of mainstream media. CNBC's Rick Santilli suggests
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:34:00.280]  giving everybody coronavirus to calm financial markets. Oh, I'm sure that would do that.
[2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:05.720]  But Biden hasn't taken cognitive tests says article trying to debunk concerns over Biden's
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:11.800]  mental health. That doesn't debunk it. In fact, that he's not done a cognitive test.
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:17.880]  Dow drops 2.6% on opening despite the good jobs, earning data. We're looking at all of it.
[2:34:17.880 --> 2:34:24.200]  The big takeaway is Pompeo says, oh, we were slow to respond to the virus because China gave us bad
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:29.640]  data. Going back to Professor Anthony Hall of AHTribune.com, an expert in globalism,
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:35.480]  professor of globalization. I want to take a few calls and the wild card angles will take us in.
[2:34:35.480 --> 2:34:40.040]  But other points you haven't had a chance to get to here in the interview that you want folks to
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:45.000]  know. And how bad do you think the virus really is going to be? How crazy is it going to get?
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:56.520]  Well, prepare for the worst and hope for the best. But Bill Gates, who would know quite a bit
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:35:01.960]  about this situation, he says, well, it looks like this is the pandemic of the century that
[2:35:01.960 --> 2:35:09.400]  we've been waiting for. But it might not be. But I just want to, in my moment here, just
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:17.800]  emphasize you, Alex, made 9-11 an issue, a public issue, the 9-11 skepticism. The phrase 9-11 is
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:24.120]  an inside job. Look at how our failure to come to terms with that as it was happening.
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:32.280]  Look at the implications. Remember the anthrax attack on Congress? And arguably this was a U.S.-backed
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:41.960]  anthrax attack because Senator Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy were questioning the Patriot Act,
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:48.760]  and they were slowing down the trajectory of the Patriot Act through Congress. And so then there
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:55.960]  was an anthrax attack, and of course it was blamed on Al Qaeda, but it was such high-quality anthrax,
[2:35:55.960 --> 2:36:02.600]  so highly distilled and refined that Francis Boyle and others said, no, no, this is from within
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:10.040]  the U.S. military. So there is this precedent that the U.S. government or some internal faction
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:19.960]  within the U.S. attacked Congress. So the idea that a biological weapon can be used probably has
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:26.200]  been used and quite possibly is being used. And that, of course, opens up the possibility,
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:32.040]  what about a retaliation? What about, okay, you're using this formula, we're going to hit you with
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:37.560]  that formula. It's a nightmare scenario to be in a biological warfare. That's right. Once the door opens,
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:41.880]  and you're right, whether it's staged or not, it's being used in a new 9-11 to say,
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:45.480]  your way of life is over, your rights are gone, we're going to have checkpoints,
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:49.240]  we're going to shut down the whole world. This could really be the death of the West.
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:57.640]  No, this is, I'd say, the implications of this for changing our whole system go beyond 9-11.
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:03.560]  And that's why we can't allow ourselves to be just pushed off to the side and that, you know,
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:09.560]  shut up conspiracy theorists. We're the Washington Post. We're the CNN. We've got the inside track
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:16.440]  with the experts and such. No, we, the people, it's our lives that are being tampered with,
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:24.120]  our futures that are being tampered with. And it's just not good enough to just say, you know,
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:28.440]  we've got the experts and here's the explanation. Professor, you're dead on, and it's all our
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:32.840]  rights to look at this. And they've been proven to be lying. Even Pompeo says China covered it up.
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:39.960]  So we, so now it's Pompeo conspiracy theorist. Well, and Pompeo, you know, it's a bad response
[2:37:39.960 --> 2:37:46.440]  in U.S. It's not a good response. We see in New York yesterday, there was a major doctor in one
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:52.360]  of the big hospitals saying, we have no test kits, people coming into the hospital in New York,
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:59.240]  looking for a way to be tested. And we can't, we can't do that. Exactly. Is the CDC that incompetent
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:03.960]  or are they lying, saying testing kits were sent out to set Trump up? I mean, because this is really
[2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:11.720]  crazy. Or are they in on the on the gig? Are they in on the jig? You know, are they is the idea to
[2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:19.560]  get the virus going in the United States in order to start the money flow to big pharma and in order
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:27.320]  to bring in the vaccine regime and all of that. And one thing about the way the research is done
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:34.520]  in these labs, you start to see that the people that were are working on these viruses, one day
[2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:41.320]  they're doing public health in quotes, they're doing, you know, looking for vaccines. They're
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:46.520]  making the bio weapon that you need the vaccines for. And they're going back and forth between
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:50.760]  and then they're in policy too. So they're not just developing it. Then they're making the
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:57.400]  weapon. They're then also in policy. They've got every angle covered. And we've had we are we are
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:04.120]  entitled and it's necessary to be very skeptical about vaccines and the way that vaccines can
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:09.960]  be manipulated to bring about different historical outcomes and what. Yeah, exactly. As you know,
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:14.280]  all the testing on Native Americans in Canada and the United States, indigenous peoples with
[2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:18.360]  deadly vaccines or poor white people, poor black people, any group that doesn't have anybody to
[2:39:18.360 --> 2:39:23.240]  stand up for them is tested on by this mad scientist cult that we keep running into.
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:31.720]  Yeah. And you know, how much have we been tested on? There's lots of cases on record of, you know,
[2:39:31.720 --> 2:39:38.440]  experiments on human beings taking place. Was the princess was that big yacht? Was that a human
[2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:44.440]  experiment? Was that some kind of effort to not totally agree, Professor? You're doing an awesome
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:49.320]  job. Let's bring some colors in. Charles in Seattle, the epicenter of the North American
[2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:53.880]  outbreak. Tell us what you're seeing with the seniors, citizen centers that you work with.
[2:39:53.880 --> 2:40:02.040]  Hi, Alex. Hi, Alex. Yeah, I drive a bus for seniors and on the south. Let's just say the
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:10.600]  south metro area of Seattle. And just yesterday, the senior center that I serve that I take people
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:18.600]  to and take them home, they ordered that shut down until until further notice. And I spoke to
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:23.880]  people and found out there's senior centers around the Seattle area. They're shutting down because
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:33.800]  you know, the susceptibility of that population for spreading and getting the more the worst for,
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:41.480]  you know, to get really sick. So I just pointing out that's the status change right here going on
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:46.920]  in the Seattle area. And hopefully that'll slow down the spread of this problem. Well, that's what
[2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:51.080]  I got told a month ago by White House sources is they already had Seattle ready. They thought it
[2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:55.240]  had broken quarantine. They were already getting ready to lock down. But that I mean, that's big
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:41:01.480]  news that that's not in the news yet. That's what you were told. Well, I mean, I'm I did I took
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:07.720]  people home yesterday early from the senior center. And we have not taken anybody there.
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:13.320]  We're being asked maybe to pick up some meals and take them out when normally we would take those
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:20.600]  people to the senior center in the morning. And so that's what our current situation is.
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:26.440]  So we're already seeing restrictions in travel up front is what you're saying.
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:32.120]  I would say so, at least locally here. And yeah, that would, yeah.
[2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:35.400]  Professor Hall, do you have any questions or comments for Charles?
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:42.280]  Well, Seattle looks like it's a case study in a backward,
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:50.040]  unenlightened approach to preparing for this possible epidemic or plague.
[2:41:50.040 --> 2:41:56.840]  As I say, true news, Rick Wilde that true news has they have been doing a significant job in
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:04.760]  covering this. And on that yesterday, I saw them bringing in essentially like shacks,
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:10.760]  like portable shacks, setting them up in a poor neighborhood. And this was to supposedly be the
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:15.320]  quarantine, then they brought in. Wait a minute, I saw that in China. You're saying Seattle?
[2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:21.960]  In Seattle, yeah. Wow. And then what about the the famous old folks home that has, you know, all
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:26.840]  the deaths and what's going on there is there, you know, apparently the federal government is
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:32.280]  going to show up, but it seems to be a very poor response. All right, Jeremy, thanks for calling
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:37.880]  you. Anywhere in the United States to point out a good example of a responsible approach from
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:45.800]  government? Well, give me I'm going to see that link up on the little containment chats,
[2:42:45.800 --> 2:42:54.760]  not just in China, but I'm going to look that up right now. I also want to say that I'm happy
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:43:00.680]  to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:05.000]  prepared. And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health,
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:09.240]  take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality. And I say that
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:13.880]  from personal experience, because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:19.320]  tried them and I use them every day. And that power pack that they have the AMPM power pack,
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:24.920]  well, I wouldn't be so energetic this morning, except that I have been on a regular customer
[2:43:24.920 --> 2:43:28.600]  in that regard. I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:33.240]  remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:38.920]  about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself,
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:45.560]  remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:50.360]  for our families and for our communities. And right now, folks who are willing to think like
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:55.160]  we do are critical to the future of America. It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming

[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:48.760]  fact that it is the grassroots that gives the orders. You could be a woman that washes dishes
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:55.480]  or a man that picks turnips in a field. But if you stand up what's right and you speak out,
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:48:01.560]  you've got power. And so I've always explained to people, I don't come from the CIA or the FBI
[2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:08.760]  or some big corporation. We're truly organic. And I'm proud of that. I'm not like a Sebastian
[2:48:08.760 --> 2:48:13.960]  Gorka who like wears a three piece suit and walks around saying how elitist I am and I'm an elitist
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:20.680]  and you're all scum. I'm the opposite of that. I don't want to be the establishment. I want to
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:27.880]  pro generate and overthrow the entire corrupt system and have a rebirth. And that's what I
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:33.320]  think the listeners and viewers want for the broadcast as well. I think it's what Professor
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:37.800]  Anthony Hall wants. We got a bunch of callers here with great questions for myself, great statements
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:41.880]  to the professor. We're going to go to Jeremy in Texas. Jeremy, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:49.960]  Hi, Alex. The breaking story right now is that the CDC is hiring someone for a San Francisco
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:57.480]  quarantine. This was posted February the 27th, 2020. And actually two days later, a tech CEO
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:49:03.480]  posted one of the biggest tech company employers in San Francisco just sent an email to their
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:09.000]  managers that they should prepare for San Francisco to have a city wide quarantine next week.
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:13.480]  That's huge. I mean, I remember seeing that and I should have covered it. It's just so much.
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:16.280]  Yeah, they're definitely getting ready for this. They're in his public health advisor quarantine
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:22.760]  program. There it is with the Google ad. Yep. Center for Disease Control is putting the ads out
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:30.600]  for city wide quarantines. Tell folks what that means. That means the lockdown CDC preparing
[2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:39.000]  for the lockdown of San Francisco just like Wuhan. It means tell on us because look at the poop map
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:43.080]  in San Francisco. You have this running around. Let's show the guy eating the poop. I didn't
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:47.560]  get to this two days ago, but queue it up. The homeless mental patients are now eating their
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:54.680]  poop in San Francisco. Right. So you have the poop map, you have typhus breaking out, and the last
[2:49:54.680 --> 2:49:59.720]  thing you really want in any sort of pandemic. And by the way, actually let me back up a little
[2:49:59.720 --> 2:50:06.840]  bit because what really started the coronavirus was a Harvard epidemiologist that said the coronavirus
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:12.920]  is a quote unquote thermonuclear pandemic. That was the phrase that was the phrasing that originally
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:19.080]  launched the viral idea of coronavirus being a pandemic was this Harvard epidemiologist.
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:24.200]  And so if you actually have a pandemic and you have it in San Francisco, where there's typhus,
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:28.280]  where there's all this dirtiness, and you put a lid on that, you're going to have a plague
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:35.080]  of some sort. No, I agree. So why have Democrats created these poop eating facilities and abort
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:40.280]  all the babies and Satanism? And is it like an alien transmission or what? I mean, why are they
[2:50:40.280 --> 2:50:47.000]  trying to destroy everything? It's definitely something that the founding fathers had known
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:52.360]  about and had fought. I can't say it's even China doing this as much as China wants to.
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:57.560]  It's the wild hell of the mob. You create so much freedom. It creates a bunch of decade and people
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:05.960]  that can be manipulated. Exactly. There's a large segment of that elitist population,
[2:51:05.960 --> 2:51:09.160]  even though it's a small population that wants to control everybody. But on top of that,
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:12.840]  you do have these shadowy organizations like I would just throw a name out there. One of that
[2:51:12.840 --> 2:51:18.200]  gentleman was saying, oh, I want to know some faction names. Well, someone who's very real right
[2:51:18.200 --> 2:51:22.280]  now, Eric Schmidt, looking at Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, then he was a chairman CEO.
[2:51:22.280 --> 2:51:28.280]  Now he's a chairman of the U.S. Department of Defense Innovation Board. And so what has he
[2:51:28.280 --> 2:51:32.360]  really overseen? Google jigsaw, which was formerly Google ideas. This all gets really
[2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:38.520]  complicated. But let me go back into the CDC quarantine. So the following day after CDC said
[2:51:38.520 --> 2:51:45.160]  they were hiring, there was a train in Houston, Texas, going downtown Houston, Texas that had
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:52.680]  military equipment with 60, 100 kilowatt generators. There were pterodynes, actually, just like your
[2:51:52.680 --> 2:51:57.880]  pterodynes, with trailers with these generators on the back going right down Houston, Texas.
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:04.760]  There was a lesser credible tweet that said that FEMA quarantine, potential FEMA quarantines,
[2:52:04.760 --> 2:52:11.640]  whistleblower was texted that, prepare for quarantine. So I don't think there's any
[2:52:11.640 --> 2:52:16.520]  doubt that we're going to see quarantines in a crisis. Jeremy, great points. Let me ask
[2:52:16.520 --> 2:52:22.040]  Professor Hall about that. How bad do you expect the lockdown to get? I mean, and what are you
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:27.240]  thinking you should be done? Well, I'd like, is Jeremy still there? No, Jeremy's gone now. Sorry,
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:32.680]  I should have held him. Go ahead. Because, you know, I found out a very kind of confusing account,
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:39.240]  a startling account. That would be, you know, one of the, that's a huge news if there is an idea
[2:52:39.240 --> 2:52:45.240]  of shutting down quarantine, quarantining San Francisco. Nothing close to that has ever happened
[2:52:45.240 --> 2:52:54.440]  in U.S. history. The ads are real. CDC's hiring quarantine officers for citywide quarantines.
[2:52:54.440 --> 2:53:00.440]  We have the ad on TV. So you just put an ad in the paper and hire. That's the thing,
[2:53:00.440 --> 2:53:07.720]  is they always hide this stuff in plain view. I mean, it speaks of, this is going to be ad
[2:53:07.720 --> 2:53:13.720]  hot. There is no preparation. No, you're right. This is not well planned. Which shows that.
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:17.400]  Are we going to say that, you know, you can get health care if you're rich,
[2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:24.520]  and you can get proper treatment. But if you're not rich, just go to the little sheds that they're
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:35.240]  setting up with their porta-potties somewhere in Seattle. Like, this is a mess. Well, and
[2:53:35.240 --> 2:53:45.080]  eating poop kind of dramatizes how things, how terrible the disparity has become between a tiny,
[2:53:45.800 --> 2:53:53.800]  enormously entitled elite at the top and at the bottom, it's street life. And what's going to
[2:53:53.800 --> 2:53:59.400]  happen? Those are going to be the, I guess, easy spreaders. Those people are set up to be spreaders.
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:05.640]  Talk about pastry dishes. I mean, I'm not trying to show this over and over again to be gross,
[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:13.160]  folks. This is what goes on in San Francisco now. Well, then you see the pictures in China of the
[2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:19.720]  struggles between officials who are trying to pick up people. And some of them are fighting,
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:23.480]  and it looks like they're fighting for their life. Of course, you know, have they been running
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:31.480]  crematoria in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, burning bodies? The satellites have picked up the evidence
[2:54:31.480 --> 2:54:39.240]  of massive sulfur, which would only be bodies burning. Yeah. So, you know, as we head down
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:45.320]  this road, we certainly have some worrisome things put in front of us from the Wuhan situation.
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:54:50.120]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore. Great points. All right, let's go to Trina in Nebraska. You're
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:57.160]  on the air with Professor Hall. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Yeah. So, I kind of went off Gray Grease's
[2:54:57.160 --> 2:55:03.800]  report about the 5G and did my own research. So, I noticed that a lot of these other countries,
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:11.640]  especially Wuhan, obviously, that have coronavirus, they have all launched 5G. And I did some research
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:18.760]  on 5G, and I found out that it gives off 60 gigahertz, and this many gigahertz is absorbed
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:24.600]  by oxygen molecules, and the 60 gigahertz basically rotates the oxygen molecules so your
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:33.720]  hemoglobin can't absorb the oxygen. And also, the 5G can actually cause people to get atherosclerosis,
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:40.120]  and that's basically it builds plaque in your artery walls, and the plaques may cause
[2:55:40.680 --> 2:55:47.640]  rupture and acute occlusions of the artery by clot, by blood clot. And so, let's say this,
[2:55:47.640 --> 2:55:54.520]  5G is a metaphor for could there be other bioweapons or other things that Wuhan virus,
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:56:01.080]  coronavirus is a cover for, Professor? Well, this is yet another complicating factor, and it's
[2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:07.480]  enormously important in this case because Wuhan just happens to be a major center for
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:13.480]  Yahweh cell phones, which are, you know, at the front of the 5G... That's a 5G rollout.
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:21.080]  Transformation, and 5G is a whole alternative method of wireless communication, and it's,
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:27.720]  you know, a hundred times as fast, and a thousand times as toxic, like wireless communication has
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:33.640]  not been really tested. This technology has not really been tested in a human situation,
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:41.160]  and it just so happens that Wuhan, China is a place where 5G has gone live, and so it is...
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:45.640]  That'd be a normal question to ask, like, why is this breaking down a month after this is
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:50.520]  activated? Does it lower your immune system? Which we know that the wireless does that,
[2:56:50.520 --> 2:56:54.440]  and that's a major study, so this is, like you said, super powerful, and it's every,
[2:56:54.440 --> 2:56:58.760]  like, a thousand feet or so, and then we wonder, does it augment viral spread?
[2:57:00.280 --> 2:57:06.840]  Yeah, so that is a huge set of questions. Does 5G supercharge the Wuhan virus?
[2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:15.960]  Yeah, and is this a targeted thing? Like, when you look at another issue, when you look at what's
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:21.720]  going on in Iran, where you have, you know, a much higher incidence of people getting sick
[2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:26.200]  and dying... Professor, do a few more minutes with us. Back into that, my next question.
[2:57:26.200 --> 2:57:30.680]  Why is Iran piles of dead bodies and body bags? Is that a hoax, or is that real?
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:36.200]  You're studying it. Try to give us your best perspective. Hour 4, straight ahead. More phone
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:40.360]  calls. Final second with the professor, and then we have Dr. Dick Bates.
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:49.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars of family of listeners and viewers
[2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:53.960]  that without you we won't be on the air, and I spend a lot of time thanking you,

[2:58:02.680 --> 2:58:08.520]  something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:12.680]  amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there,

[2:59:49.240 --> 3:00:00.920]  This is the time of the same headlines pouring out by the minute at infowars.com.
[3:00:00.920 --> 3:00:04.200]  Former supermarket boss warns a potential coronavirus food riots.
[3:00:04.920 --> 3:00:09.880]  Army patrols, grocery stores may have to take drastic measures. Paul Joseph Watson
[3:00:09.880 --> 3:00:15.400]  in infowars.com, we're taking your phone calls right now with the professor Anthony Hall.
[3:00:15.400 --> 3:00:22.760]  You can see it. It's not like we're even debating how bad this is going to get.
[3:00:25.320 --> 3:00:31.240]  The supply chain breakdown, the hysteria, the just-on-time deliveries, China more than half
[3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:36.120]  the shipments come to the U.S. This is already going to be incredibly devastating. We shouldn't
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:40.280]  lie to people, you aren't, I'm not. I just wonder how bad it's going to get. What do you think?
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:48.280]  Well, the stock market is already tanked. I mean, the implications were back at the level of 2008,
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:57.880]  and so the implications are drastic. Now, the idea, if it's a bio weapon, that means it's targeted,
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:03.000]  and there's a question of ethnicity. Do you target an ethnic group? If you don't target
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:10.360]  an ethnic group and you set the beast afoot in the population, who says it's not going to come back
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:17.000]  on your own population? So the targeting of Iran, it looks like Iran is being targeted,
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:23.480]  especially because so many of the deaths and the illnesses have been directed at government people,
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:29.320]  at high officials. That's what I'm questioning. Exactly. It looks like it was seeded out and
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:35.880]  the major outbreak is used as a cover. Yeah. And so where else is going to be targeted?
[3:01:36.520 --> 3:01:44.200]  In China, the cybersecurity people who are in charge of the firewall, the very controversial
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:49.000]  firewall that prevents China from getting access to a lot of what's on the Internet,
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:57.720]  apparently 200 of them were targeted and are suffering from the illness. So even within China,
[3:01:57.720 --> 3:02:03.400]  there is some suggestion that there is a targeting taking place, and that has
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:10.120]  huge implications, and it causes us to want to demand, who's behind this? Who is really,
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:15.640]  rather than just saying, shut up, everybody, if you question that. No, we should have a massive
[3:02:15.640 --> 3:02:19.080]  debate. That's how you get answers. Exactly. That's how you get human intelligence
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:25.800]  analyzing exactly the way so many political enemies have died from this. Do they kill them and
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:31.720]  claim the virus? Did it? Or do they have viruses we know they have that you give them that are
[3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:36.680]  super viral at first, kill you, but then mutate into harmless very quickly? Because you wouldn't
[3:02:36.680 --> 3:02:40.920]  want to release a bio web and they kept going, but they've got them that will kill two or three
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:45.320]  people that they hit, maybe three replications, but then they burn out. And so are they hitting
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:51.560]  their political enemies with us using that as a cover? Is Dr. Lee the whistleblower in Wuhan?
[3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:59.320]  He died a few days later. Was he taken out? Was he targeted? Well, amazing points, sir. I hope
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:03.320]  that you'll join us again soon. The minute and a half we have left. What else is on your radar?
[3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:15.880]  What else is on my radar? Well, this is a moment for humanity. This is a situation unlike any
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:23.640]  other that I can think of this. I cannot see that we return to the world we're leaving now
[3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:31.560]  with this upon us. And so this is in the moment, you know, the religious people are going to be
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:37.160]  you're saying coronavirus is obviously a big event, whether it's being hyped up or not,
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:40.840]  you can see it. It's now official. It's it's it's it's a big one.
[3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:49.080]  Yeah, and there's no way back to the world we've known. It's it's it's going to alter our way of
[3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:56.520]  life dramatically. Like if San Francisco goes into quarantine next week, the United States,
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:04:01.320]  that's not going to be the first town that it strikes. Oh, the stock market will go down 5000
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:06.600]  points today. That happens. Yeah, I mean, our whole financial system, China is at the very
[3:04:06.600 --> 3:04:13.960]  heart of our production. You know, they took over the factories of capitalism and and all the
[3:04:13.960 --> 3:04:19.080]  financial flow goes through there. You take that out at the middle, which has already happened.
[3:04:19.640 --> 3:04:24.680]  And look what happened to the stock market. Professor, I'm already familiar with your work
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:28.200]  and was already impressed, but I'm really impressed. Now, please join us in the war room,
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:31.960]  day to night in the mornings. I really want to get you on all the different shows,
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:35.640]  because I really think you're giving reasonable wide spectrum, you know what you're talking about.
[3:04:35.640 --> 3:04:39.480]  And you're just you're looking at big picture for folks, not even giving specific answers.
[3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:43.320]  You're just saying, here's what's going on. I find it very informative and very
[3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:47.400]  thought provoking. So please come on my show again next week. Please go on David Knight's
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:52.760]  show. Please go on. I want to show your show. Thank you so much, Professor. The best product,
[3:04:52.760 --> 3:04:55.880]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried turbo
[3:04:55.880 --> 3:05:00.840]  force, you need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know,
[3:05:00.840 --> 3:05:04.760]  I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't
[3:05:04.760 --> 3:05:08.520]  remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite. And all the
[3:05:08.520 --> 3:05:11.960]  info wars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[3:05:13.160 --> 3:05:17.480]  not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:22.040]  and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today.
[3:05:22.040 --> 3:05:26.040]  You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[3:05:26.040 --> 3:05:29.480]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think
[3:05:29.480 --> 3:05:32.760]  that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and
[3:05:32.760 --> 3:05:36.280]  said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's
[3:05:36.280 --> 3:05:40.200]  only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what?
[3:05:40.200 --> 3:05:43.400]  Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's why
[3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:46.920]  you need to go to info wars.com, take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[3:05:46.920 --> 3:05:50.200]  Don't buy into the group. Think don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force.
[3:05:50.200 --> 3:06:06.120]  Kool-Aid's bad. The turbo force is good.
[3:06:08.360 --> 3:06:16.840]  25% of the world's generic drugs are made in India. And India relies upon China for almost
[3:06:16.840 --> 3:06:25.080]  70% of their active ingredients. Several of these Chinese sources have shut down due to the Wuhan
[3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:33.080]  coronavirus. And as a result, India has restricted exports of 26 ingredients and the medicines made
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:43.480]  from them. The United States no longer produces its own medicine. How did this happen? In the 1990s,
[3:06:43.480 --> 3:06:50.120]  90% of these fundamental ingredients were produced in the USA, Europe, and in Japan.
[3:06:51.080 --> 3:06:56.840]  But US laws on generic drugs began motivating companies to manufacture in China.
[3:06:58.680 --> 3:07:06.520]  The greatest win for China came exactly three months after 9 11. On December 11, 2001,
[3:07:06.520 --> 3:07:15.560]  China joined the World Trade Organization, aka the WTO, and immediately began wiping out the
[3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:24.680]  competition in the American free market with unbeatable low slave labor costs. Within two years,
[3:07:24.680 --> 3:07:31.320]  the USA lost their last aspirin, penicillin, and vitamin C producers.
[3:07:31.320 --> 3:07:40.040]  Today, we depend upon China for about 90% of our medicine. China has already amassed a reputation
[3:07:40.040 --> 3:07:47.080]  for poor quality. And because they have monopolized the global market, the FDA has been forced to
[3:07:47.080 --> 3:07:54.280]  lower their manufacturing standards. The low standards in China are likely to blame in part
[3:07:54.280 --> 3:08:01.480]  for the many explosions at Chinese pharmaceutical factories that have caused global shortages.
[3:08:02.200 --> 3:08:09.400]  Recently, because of the Wuhan coronavirus, masks were ordered to not be exported from China.
[3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:17.480]  There are life-sustaining drugs that China is the sole supplier of to the US. What happens if China
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:25.400]  declares an emergency and shuts down all medical supply and drug exports, like both India and
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:35.800]  China are already beginning to do? If the WTO is the father of globalism, then the UN's
[3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:43.960]  insidious replacement migration is its mother. And in Italy, the man believed to be coronavirus
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:52.200]  patient zero is a Pakistani migrant who works in food delivery. After testing positive for the virus,
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:59.320]  he refused to self-isolate and continued to deliver food. A recent video of migrants holding
[3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:04.920]  babies over fires to make them cry in order to deceitfully cross the border into Greece
[3:09:05.640 --> 3:09:12.920]  shows several people speaking Farsi. They are Iranian. Iran is currently suffering an
[3:09:12.920 --> 3:09:20.600]  outbreak of the coronavirus. Why on earth should Greece allow them in? The coronavirus appears to
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:27.560]  be some type of eugenics bio weapon designed to kill the weak and elderly. But one thing is for
[3:09:27.560 --> 3:09:35.560]  certain, it has already killed the philosophy of globalism. And now it will be stress testing
[3:09:35.560 --> 3:09:43.400]  the precarious digital grid that our entire society is based upon. For info wars dot com,
[3:09:43.400 --> 3:09:51.880]  this is Greg Reese. Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to go to your phone calls, but
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:58.040]  my superhero powers is telling the truth. You probably listened to like the last two hours,
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:03.160]  and you didn't hear me plug on the air vitamins, minerals, supplements, horrible foods.
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:09.160]  Because things are so crazy now. It feels opportunistic, even though I've been selling
[3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:13.160]  horrible foods for decades, even though I sell high quality supplements, they boost your immune
[3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:19.400]  system. It's like I'm selling life preserves for people that are about to jump in the North
[3:10:19.400 --> 3:10:24.840]  Atlantic Ocean. But it still feels weird. But it's funding or operation. We have the best
[3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:28.840]  horrible food, the only major company that still has horrible food that can deliver it to you.
[3:10:28.840 --> 3:10:32.440]  The others are frauds, folks. They're liars. We have the biggest, best, highest rated company
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:36.440]  because I went out and got them 11 years ago. They've been around 12 years with the mission
[3:10:36.440 --> 3:10:40.440]  of getting you horrible food delivered. Now that takes six to eight weeks, probably less,
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:44.840]  but they're just saying that so you don't get mad. They have the food. They even set up extra
[3:10:44.840 --> 3:10:49.320]  factories, but they got to get it to you info or store.com, the great folks at my Patreon.
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:55.640]  But what I do have ready to ship is micro zx that flushes out your guts for the candida,
[3:10:55.640 --> 3:11:00.440]  the yeast, the mold, then let your bodies of immune systems super boost. This is so important
[3:11:00.440 --> 3:11:07.160]  back in stock, micro zx, 40% off DNA force plus, the PQQ, the CoQ 10 to clean out your cells.
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:10.680]  This is the number one thing in my view you can do if you're immune system. It's back in stock,
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:16.840]  40% off info or store.com. And it costs a lot because the ingredients cost a lot. But we have
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:20.920]  things like the super silver wound gel that is approved over the count of the strongest silver
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:24.760]  you're going to find. It's great. And then they didn't have to do a bunch of patenting and FDA
[3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:30.920]  stuff for the other products we have. So they're less. The super silver wound gel, you know,
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:35.800]  same, but not as strong systems would savings have the mouth toothpaste, super silver toothpaste,
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:41.080]  50% off, you know, it's selling out. Then we have turbo force, the great natural energy,
[3:11:41.080 --> 3:11:47.240]  vitamin mineral fusion system back in stock, all 40% off. And that's how we fund this operation.
[3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:50.440]  But I would just encourage everyone, if you have vitamins and minerals,
[3:11:50.440 --> 3:11:56.760]  take them, drink filtered water, get some sunshine, exercise, pray that boost your immune system.
[3:11:56.760 --> 3:12:00.840]  And I think most people are going to be okay. But this is definitely a serious time to be alive.
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:06.360]  People should visit info or store.com and get your orders in because these are products you need.
[3:12:06.360 --> 3:12:10.840]  These are products that make your life better. And it funds this operation. Now we've got Max and
[3:12:10.840 --> 3:12:15.560]  Jeff and Gordon and Terry and Mike. And I want to try to go to all of you. We have Dr. Nick Baggots
[3:12:15.560 --> 3:12:20.520]  who takes his time out to be here. And he's a smart guy on the area, his view on this. So that's coming
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:25.800]  up as well. But right now let's go to Max in Wisconsin. Thanks for holding Max here on the air.
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:31.880]  What's up, Alice? I have seven angles about coronavirus that nobody's talked about.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:38.120]  But first, some production and personal tips for you. I think you need to get a shuffle dial,
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:43.800]  ran from the studio to your desk so you can scroll through clips easily with like a long USB cable.
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:49.960]  And also you should get a steel canker chip instead of con because it's less abrasive to your face.
[3:12:50.840 --> 3:12:57.000]  Anyways, I was wondering if you remember that whistleblower gal you had on years ago,
[3:12:57.800 --> 3:13:01.720]  I don't remember when, who said one of the goals of the U.S. and assumedly
[3:13:02.600 --> 3:13:08.520]  worldwide bioweapons manufacturers is to create a virus that can target single individuals,
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:13.960]  their genetic helix or parts of the spiral of the helix. Do you remember who that was?
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:18.920]  I forget, but we do know they're pushing race specific bioweapons that hit certain groups.
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:25.720]  And yes, the Holy Grail would be a genome targeted weapon that hits an individual. And Dr.
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:29.480]  Baggots can specifically speak to that. He's been a trailblazer in that area.
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:37.480]  Okay. Also, I wish you'd be more honest with your sales of storeable food because as you
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:44.600]  know, people who have minimal or no food prep would be banned from post apocalyptic safe zone
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:49.720]  fortresses due to the fact that normal domesticated humans will go wild, buck wild,
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:54.440]  mutate like grasshoppers to locusts upon brutal conditions and lack of food and water.
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:13:59.160]  Well, and you say more honest, I mean, I'm opening the calls up, you can say whatever
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:02.520]  you want. That's honesty right there. I mean, there's nothing more honest than just boom,
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:07.560]  you're on the air, say whatever you want. And, you know, also a big boy like you or me, you know,
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:13.000]  during a post apocalyptic activities will be burning double at least the amount of calories.
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:16.600]  So, you know, people should definitely have a lot of food store.
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:23.080]  No, you're right. I appreciate your call, sir. Max is right. I mean, we take food to mouth delivery.
[3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:28.200]  We take just on time delivery as a normal thing. We've never been in a position of being more
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:32.360]  domesticated and more ready for total societal breakdown. When we come back, I'm going to add
[3:14:32.360 --> 3:14:36.760]  that, ask Dr. Dick baggage that question and then let him take over. And then we'll probably just
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:40.440]  tomorrow. I'm probably going to come in on Saturday to do a special report of not Sunday.
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:46.520]  Get to Terry and Mike and Gordon and Jeff. I've really tried to get to you all and
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:50.920]  I apologize that I haven't gotten to you. I've tried my best. So we can get the names and numbers
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:54.520]  of these folks. I need to talk to the crew after the show. We probably need to get an extra crew
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:58.040]  in here tomorrow because we need to come in. These are not normal times and this is obviously
[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:01.880]  the big globalist move. They're obviously hyping it up. They obviously want to take over. We
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:06.840]  shouldn't live in fear. Number one thing for immune system is not live in fear and then pray
[3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:13.000]  and just get healthy. And I think we're going to be okay. But Dr. Nick baggage is about to take
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:18.920]  over. I want to ask him a few questions about this when we come back, but absolutely the holy
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:24.200]  grail of their takeover plan is where they get your DNA and they can then go in with gene editing,
[3:15:24.200 --> 3:15:31.000]  CRISPR technology and create a virus just for you, just for you. What they've got now we know is
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:35.800]  viruses that they give you in the form of their most deadly that they mutate to something harmless
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:42.760]  afterwards. But it's still all playing God. Dr. Nick baggage's father first exposed all this
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:46.680]  was killed his brother's been a U. S. Senator, but he's the most prominent family in my view
[3:15:46.680 --> 3:15:53.160]  for all of his books and groundbreaking research. Most of you know that heart disease is the number
[3:15:53.160 --> 3:15:58.440]  one silent killer in the U. S. What if I told you for just 54 95 a month you could fight against
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:03.560]  heart disease naturally at heart and body extract. We've been helping thousands of people get back

[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:17.240]  the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.

[3:17:48.200 --> 3:17:54.200]  a security which requires an offering document. There's a lot of phony garbage out there in
[3:17:54.200 --> 3:18:00.440]  the world. A lot of people that never deliver. Well, I'm here to tell you, Info Wars has delivered
[3:18:00.440 --> 3:18:07.960]  in royal flush in a handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of
[3:18:07.960 --> 3:18:13.640]  activists and because of the great team at Info Wars. And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:18:13.640 --> 3:18:18.200]  So, right now, humanity's awakening is explosive. It's powerful. It's incredible.
[3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:23.640]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road. And the only way we can effectively fight
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:28.360]  the NWO and stay in the game like Info Wars has to tip the spear is your financial support. We
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:35.160]  make it really easy at inforworshore.com. But I am blowing through our backup money right now
[3:18:35.160 --> 3:18:39.640]  with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it.
[3:18:39.640 --> 3:18:44.040]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, seven days a week during this
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:48.520]  election year that's so critical. But they need the financing to put them in the field.
[3:18:48.520 --> 3:19:10.040]  Go to inforworshore.com and fight for your own future.
[3:19:18.520 --> 3:19:22.520]  I said, no, and I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:27.560]  go. She wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowors.com and just said she's still on.
[3:19:27.560 --> 3:19:31.880]  I run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go,
[3:19:31.880 --> 3:19:35.160]  oh, Alex, I used to love you. I wish you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on
[3:19:35.160 --> 3:19:38.760]  air? And I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[3:19:38.760 --> 3:19:43.320]  We have our own streams at infowors.com. And man, they go, really? They said you were off the air
[3:19:43.320 --> 3:19:50.040]  because they took the platforming as off the air. No, we have our own platform infowors, infowors,
[3:19:50.040 --> 3:19:51.000]  infowors.
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:20:13.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:13.320 --> 3:20:17.480]  All right, Dr. Nick Magich is about to take over. We really appreciate him, but I have my own
[3:20:17.480 --> 3:20:26.200]  solvus questions here. EarthPulse.com. And again, I respect him. So I don't have guests on that
[3:20:26.200 --> 3:20:30.120]  agree with me. I don't know what I think about this virus. I just know the evidence came out,
[3:20:30.120 --> 3:20:37.080]  it was manmade. It's being protected. They're using it as a giant hype system to take over
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:20:41.240]  and to centralize things. And they're now trying to say it's all Trump's fault.
[3:20:41.240 --> 3:20:48.920]  I know you've got a lot to cover today and a lot of your own topics to get into. So I'll be listening
[3:20:48.920 --> 3:20:57.800]  to those. But Dr. Magich, what do you just as a patriot, as a man, gut level, what do you
[3:20:57.800 --> 3:21:05.960]  think's really going on here? Well, first of all, I think that the country really did very,
[3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:12.440]  very little. I mentioned last week that I had traveled direct from Hong Kong to Seattle
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:19.160]  on a flight on February the 8th, which on the way out, I was coming out of Thailand,
[3:21:19.160 --> 3:21:25.160]  on the way out of Thailand, they checked my and my fiance's temperatures. They checked us going
[3:21:25.160 --> 3:21:32.280]  into Hong Kong. They checked us going through the transit station basically in the Hong Kong
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:37.960]  airport. And then we flew 14 hours nonstop to Seattle. They didn't ask us any questions.
[3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:43.960]  They didn't check temperatures. They didn't do anything. And actually, even 14 days before
[3:21:43.960 --> 3:21:49.480]  going into Thailand, they checked our temperature. And so when I think about was the U.S. doing
[3:21:49.480 --> 3:21:57.000]  anything, the answer was no. Friends of mine coming in as late as the last couple days of
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:02.600]  February from direct flights from Hong Kong again, no questions, no temperature checks, no nothing.
[3:22:03.480 --> 3:22:10.520]  I find that pretty remarkable. And when I think about the third world organizing their borders
[3:22:10.520 --> 3:22:15.240]  so rapidly and then taking action, they didn't need a committee meeting and a bunch of other
[3:22:15.240 --> 3:22:22.440]  things. They just took action. They knew what action to take. And so given the normal preparation
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:29.080]  of the country for things, I find it remarkable no action was taken. And even now the actions are
[3:22:29.080 --> 3:22:35.800]  delayed and listening and looking at the news feeds and the impacts of all this, I think we're
[3:22:35.800 --> 3:22:43.320]  in for a lot more than what we're seeing. And the fundamentals economically, I started shorting the
[3:22:43.320 --> 3:22:49.240]  market and shorting the Dow actually in January. I never did it in my life, but I got really nervous
[3:22:49.240 --> 3:22:55.960]  about what was happening in the economic arenas. And so I see this conveniently
[3:22:56.760 --> 3:23:01.400]  one of the best camouflages for the other things that were already wrong with the economy,
[3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:06.280]  giving bankers a one. Exactly. Cover for the globalist have a reset.
[3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:11.560]  Yeah. And you know, when I look at what was happening, if you look at what I was looking at
[3:23:11.560 --> 3:23:16.600]  the year end where the overnight funds and the repurchase agreement, which is all complicated
[3:23:16.600 --> 3:23:21.720]  economics, but the bottom line is normally it's bankers trading money with bankers, but the Fed
[3:23:21.720 --> 3:23:28.840]  had to step in to like a half a trillion dollars through the last weeks of the year end. And then
[3:23:28.840 --> 3:23:34.520]  in the last several days, hitting their ceilings of a hundred billion dollars in overnight funds,
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:40.440]  the shortage of liquidity is part of the problem going into this thing before this ever happened.
[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:43.080]  Because the more liquidity you give, the more you've got to have.
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:51.240]  Yeah. And the problem is you can, you know, that affects maybe the demand side. But on this
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:56.840]  equation going right now, we have a supply side interruption, which you can't really fix. You
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:24:03.800]  can't exactly. Fiat money is not going to paper over China. That is the majority of the backbone
[3:24:03.800 --> 3:24:09.960]  of world supplies that gets cut off. I mean, so you think China launched it, the globalist
[3:24:09.960 --> 3:24:13.240]  launched it, that the U.S. launched it? Because we know it's obviously, I mean, it looks to me
[3:24:13.240 --> 3:24:18.280]  synthetic. Who, that's what, who stands to gain it? And it would. Well, I think they all win.
[3:24:18.280 --> 3:24:22.360]  They all win because they exploit the opportunity, whether they triggered it or whether it's
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:27.560]  opportunistic. This is a screw down opportunity. And now it's too late to put the genie back in
[3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:32.520]  the bottom line. Exactly. Any way you slice it, this is a clampdown. We're in the jaws of the
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:37.000]  crocodile get ready. Right. Right. It doesn't matter how it got, how it started. It's like
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:42.040]  arguing about what caused climate change when everybody sees there's obviously something
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:47.160]  happening. You know, is it nature? Is it man? Well, it's happening. You know, fight over it
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:51.960]  all you want. But here we have the same situation. Supply chain. And why is that important today?
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:56.760]  Because of a couple things. Before this. That's like asking why is oxygen important? We're totally
[3:24:56.760 --> 3:25:03.960]  dependent now. Right. But, but great international freight. When you look at the way they look at
[3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:10.760]  that and you look at freight volume is coming across the oceans before they're reporting.
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:18.200]  It's down 90 percent. Right. And now it's off the charts down the boards. We're already showing
[3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:22.280]  that slow down and what was coming into the country because economy was slowing down.
[3:25:22.280 --> 3:25:27.160]  Profits, corporate profits were down to minimum. And what's been feeding the market has been
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:32.040]  there's nowhere else for people to put money and everyone is forced into these 401ks. So they
[3:25:32.040 --> 3:25:37.880]  keep plowing more money in. And so that's what Jack the market's all about. That's what's right
[3:25:37.880 --> 3:25:44.440]  there. I mean, usually there's containers and 500 feet. There's nothing there. No. In fact,
[3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:49.560]  I I talked to a friend of mine that's in an apartment building across the street from the
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:54.360]  port and it's tallest building in Long Beach. You look out his window and I asked him the other
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:26:01.400]  day, I said, what's going on at the port? And it was like nothing compared to that's the purest form
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:08.280]  of news or intelligence is someone on the ground observing it. Right. And so here's what happened
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:13.480]  when I was in Thailand, already tourism was down to nothing. I went to Chinese New Year's
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:18.680]  in Phuket, which is the 30th of January. And there was like 10 percent of the normal crowd. My
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:25.240]  business partner lives there. You know, he said, hey, everybody's gone. Nobody's here. And you
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:29.320]  know, and that was then, you know, that's a month and a half ago. And when I think about
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:35.000]  out, we're in like this slow motion sort of train wreck. And we don't really see you just
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:39.560]  quantify it. I feel like I'm in a slow motion train wreck. And I feel like I've lost for the
[3:26:39.560 --> 3:26:43.960]  first time in my life power over what's happening because I can fight politics and do things. But
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:48.760]  now I feel like I'm caught in a river. And it's like, I'm like, well, where's this river going?
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:54.280]  You know, when I was looking at the economy and I, and again, I asked, I didn't even know how
[3:26:54.280 --> 3:26:58.120]  to do it. I saw a friend of mine and he said, Hey, do you really believe this is going to crash?
[3:26:58.120 --> 3:27:01.320]  You should short the short the Dow. And I said, I don't know how to short the Dow. You know,
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:05.800]  so I called my son. It's pretty bright guy. And I said, Hey, how do I short the Dow? And he goes
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:10.040]  est out, you know, by est out. And I said, Can I short est out? Can I buy an option? I
[3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:16.600]  est out on the downside. And so I shorted a short and actually a balance my stock portfolio. So
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:21.880]  I mean, I have a lot in stock, but I didn't lose anything. And the point is we saw it coming
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:25.640]  without this. And then I told him, I said, you know, the one thing that would just trigger this
[3:27:25.640 --> 3:27:33.000]  even worse on steroids is a pandemic. And we got one. I mean, you couldn't have predicted
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.720]  this rig. So let me ask you got low. First, you know, that game first thing comes to your mind.
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:45.160]  Who's behind it? My view is it's exploiting a global supporting the opportunity this way to
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:48.840]  a certain global is using it to just change the subject and grab power.
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:54.680]  Right. Because when you look at this compared to the swine flu as an example right now. And,
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:58.920]  you know, it was like the swine flu when it happened. Originally, they said killed about
[3:27:58.920 --> 3:28:05.480]  12,000. Then later after the fact, they analyzed the dad. Oh, oops. It was 300,000. But, you know,
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:10.920]  nobody even jumped danced around anything. You know, we didn't even blink. And we've got this one
[3:28:10.920 --> 3:28:16.520]  sort of coming at us, but we didn't do anything. And now it's here, ladies and gentlemen. Now we're
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:21.480]  going to see what it actually does. But it already has done the damage in the economy. And that's
[3:28:21.480 --> 3:28:26.200]  something that you can't reproduce. We're going to take over. I'm going to leave you here. But
[3:28:26.200 --> 3:28:30.920]  I want to ask you when you come back, Dr. Nick baggage of earthpulse.com.
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:38.920]  Whether it's a super deadly virus or not, the supply side, the whole chain delivery infrastructure
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:43.880]  is real. This crisis is here. Just on that. How bad is it straight ahead of Nick baggage?

[3:30:01.160 --> 3:30:06.840]  human world. But we know they're going to strike back. And the UN has said that they're going to
[3:30:06.840 --> 3:30:13.400]  absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes
[3:30:13.400 --> 3:30:18.600]  to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and
[3:30:18.600 --> 3:30:24.920]  pivot program. The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world
[3:30:24.920 --> 3:30:32.360]  government inner coronavirus. This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed

[3:33:21.320 --> 3:33:27.560]  And welcome back.
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:41.160]  And it's good. It's good to be back. And you know, this was the topic of the day. You know,
[3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:45.000]  when I think about sort of what's been happening and I'm watching the news feeds and
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:51.240]  not pay pretty close attention. And again, going into this year, you know, I was pretty skittish
[3:33:51.240 --> 3:33:57.480]  about what I was saying and it was like anything could trigger the avalanche, you know, and this
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:34:02.680]  really gives central bankers cover, you know, because they have totally screwed this up every
[3:34:02.680 --> 3:34:10.520]  way. When you think of supply chain interruption, this is a total screw up for greed and for money,
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:16.600]  for multinational corporations and for others. And now they're all in trouble, right? And who's
[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:22.280]  going to bail them out? Most likely it's not going to be them. But let's talk about this for a
[3:34:22.280 --> 3:34:27.080]  moment. Let's talk about China, first of all, and sort of the sequence of events. One of the things
[3:34:27.080 --> 3:34:34.040]  that people forget about in what was going on in China is a real lockdown on individual freedom.
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:39.240]  You know, I mean, you had protests in Hong Kong, remember, and things were going crazy there. And
[3:34:39.240 --> 3:34:45.240]  then you had in China, greater and greater surveillance technologies being imposed on the
[3:34:45.240 --> 3:34:51.880]  population now more than ever. And then you look at sort of the dis-ease in what was happening
[3:34:51.880 --> 3:34:56.520]  underneath the economy in China, because they were speculating on speculation. So people were
[3:34:56.520 --> 3:35:01.000]  borrowing from banks that were backed by the Chinese government. And then people were lending
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:04.920]  the money they borrowed from the banks. And those people were lending the money again. And so they
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:10.040]  were compounding the interest. And there was all this crazy lending going on. And then came
[3:35:11.320 --> 3:35:18.280]  the tariff in the beginning of the slowdown in China, right? And then this, this is like the
[3:35:18.280 --> 3:35:24.040]  triple whammy on that side. And then here's the thing, supply chain interruption. There's just
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:31.080]  in time inventory. Now, Walmart is a big example of it, where you'll see the emptiness grow at
[3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:36.600]  the most rapid rate. And so when you think of just in time, that's freight moving from the
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:43.960]  factories in China over the oceans, to the ports, to the warehouses, to the stores, to you. What's
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:49.400]  happened is the freight, the Baltic freight index, before we went into this was at the lowest levels
[3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:55.720]  in history. And now it's definitely passing that up. Go look it up, Baltic freight index. Look at
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:36:00.600]  the charts over the last year. Look at it over the last three years. Look at it over the last five
[3:36:00.600 --> 3:36:06.200]  years and see what's been going on. Because that tells you what's moving into the country. Then
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:11.480]  you look at other things that are really relevant. You look at, they were going to predict a drop
[3:36:11.480 --> 3:36:17.480]  in the Fed rate already, three drops for the year they were figuring. Well, we're going to get all
[3:36:17.480 --> 3:36:22.200]  those drops and then it's going to go to zero, the interest rates, bonds are going to be first time
[3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:29.720]  in negative territory. You know, this is a dangerous time for central bankers. And they
[3:36:29.720 --> 3:36:35.640]  screwed this up, ladies and gentlemen. All those bankers that we bailed out that have been manipulating
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:40.760]  the markets and are doing it again. And you know, some of them are even working against common U.S.
[3:36:40.760 --> 3:36:48.440]  interests. You know, J.P. Morgan and who's the other big one? I forget its name, but they just
[3:36:48.440 --> 3:36:54.280]  announced that they're not going to finance any oil and gas projects in the Arctic. That's us, folks.
[3:36:54.280 --> 3:37:00.440]  20%, basically 20% little less than that of the entire land mass of the United States. The biggest
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:07.640]  deposits of oil and gas in the world. And they're not going to help us finance them because they
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:15.800]  don't want to. But we bailed these people out. Right? Come on, ladies and gentlemen. It's the
[3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:24.840]  one. It's the bankers cover story for the day because the financial sector now is in deep, deep,
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:30.040]  deep trouble, you know, in terms of what's going to be happening there. And I think they're going
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:34.760]  to be looking for another bailout and they shouldn't get it this time. And what's going to happen and
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:42.840]  what is happening was easily foreseeable and it's not done yet because the happy talk isn't going
[3:37:42.840 --> 3:37:49.640]  to do it. You can't fade your way out of a pandemic. Whether it's real or not, doesn't matter anymore
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:55.400]  because the way it's perceived has resulted in a series of actions that have now been in play
[3:37:56.040 --> 3:38:03.480]  for about eight weeks since the Chinese first started responding and people started hiding data.
[3:38:03.480 --> 3:38:07.560]  And then, you know, you look at it all and you start asking the bigger questions. Then you look
[3:38:07.560 --> 3:38:15.720]  at why is the data so loud this time around, unlike, say, the swine flu? Well, because it's
[3:38:15.720 --> 3:38:20.360]  available this time. You can hype it this time around. And we kind of forgot everything else
[3:38:20.360 --> 3:38:24.760]  that was going on in the world before this started. You know, we were on the verge of
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:29.960]  World War III, right? That I don't think has changed. I think all those factors are still in
[3:38:29.960 --> 3:38:36.920]  play out. We saw locusts in North Africa wiping out the food security for the entire north of
[3:38:36.920 --> 3:38:42.200]  a continent and the Middle East and headed towards Pakistan and China. That's still going on.
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:49.240]  Nothing stopped there. People are still unhappy in Hong Kong. That didn't change. Japan has
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:54.200]  still got an economy that isn't working and wasn't working. You still have all the same
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:59.480]  underlying problems. There's no real corporate money was being made. Now there's none being made
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:05.320]  and the forecast is less. Tourism is in the toilet. Transportation is in shambles. You don't
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:12.040]  make up the lost revenue. It's gone. Those seats weren't filled and are empty. Hotel rooms are empty.
[3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:19.240]  The cost of making up those losses is huge. You know, if you're working on a 10% margin,
[3:39:19.240 --> 3:39:25.560]  you've got to sell, you know, 10 times as much just to get a dollar back. You've got to sell
[3:39:25.560 --> 3:39:32.360]  $10 worth of rooms. You know, I mean, this is the problem, folks, is there is a roll-up cost to this
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:39.240]  that hasn't priced into the markets, as they say, because the impact isn't felt yet. And then you
[3:39:39.240 --> 3:39:44.920]  have an emotional factor, which is what's causing the yo-yo that we're seeing in the stock markets,
[3:39:44.920 --> 3:39:51.640]  but the trajectory is bad, given the underlying fundamentals. But at the same time,
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:39:59.480]  think about it. Ladies and gentlemen, rethink sort of the strategy. What do you want to put
[3:39:59.480 --> 3:40:08.120]  your money? You know, air, the stock market, you know, something real, land and real estate and
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:12.280]  things that people are going to rely on. You know, those are always the anchors to economies,
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:18.600]  not paper, fiat currencies and not stock certificates, ultimately. It's about real assets,
[3:40:18.600 --> 3:40:25.000]  your home, your farm, your factory, things that make things, land, natural resources,
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:30.200]  the things that produce wealth, labor, entrepreneurship. You know, these are the
[3:40:30.200 --> 3:40:38.280]  things that make wealth, solid, real stuff. So if you manage to get out of this mess in time,
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:43.080]  you know, think about that in the long term, because long term it's going to be a healthy
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:50.840]  thing that stuff will recover. The thing is, it's a little guy that gets looted in these times,
[3:40:50.840 --> 3:40:56.680]  and then the big guy that gets bailed out. And this time we can't let that happen quite the
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:05.080]  same way. And at the same time, we can't allow the opportunity for civil liberties to be further
[3:41:05.080 --> 3:41:10.200]  hampered. I mean, we might have to do some things, and probably will, because they're going to make
[3:41:10.200 --> 3:41:19.160]  us if we don't. But I would say, you know, be mindful, be lawful, be calm, and think things
[3:41:19.160 --> 3:41:26.840]  through, and don't be too quick to react, because that's where trouble starts. And looking around
[3:41:26.840 --> 3:41:32.440]  the world at what's going on, you know, the migration problem in Europe has not gone away.
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:38.440]  It's now on steroids as Turkey opens its borders and floods Europe with the next wave. That's
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:44.920]  in motion, ladies and gentlemen. There's a lot of discussion in Europe right now about sleeper
[3:41:44.920 --> 3:41:52.600]  cells that were dispatched there. Look at the border images. Most are males between 18 and 40
[3:41:52.600 --> 3:42:01.080]  that are headed into Europe, that are in Europe now. This is a real interesting time to be living
[3:42:01.080 --> 3:42:06.360]  in. When you think about what's happening in the Middle East right now, what's happening
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:14.440]  across the globe right now, and then a pandemic on top of it. Yeah, I am always skeptical of what
[3:42:14.440 --> 3:42:20.440]  I see. You got the Gates Foundation just set up the new dashboard for John Hopkins University.
[3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:25.880]  Go look it up. Look up the dashboard for John Hopkins. It's a new site for global
[3:42:25.880 --> 3:42:30.840]  mapping of this pandemic. And bring it up and take a look. And you'll be amazed
[3:42:31.640 --> 3:42:36.920]  at how they're tracking this one. But that also generates a newsfeed. And part of what we're
[3:42:36.920 --> 3:42:43.400]  seeing is an emotional response to a newsfeed. But that's real. Perception is real. We'll be
[3:42:43.400 --> 3:42:50.040]  right back. This is Dr. Nick Baggage on this Friday afternoon on the Alex Jones show, infowars.com.
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:55.400]  You want to break some globalist ribs? You want to crush some skulls politically? You want to
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:43:01.000]  drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually? There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:08.200]  you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar. Your bang for your
[3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:15.640]  buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit
[3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:20.280]  of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy. And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:25.720]  slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God wants to see, you see, we have
[3:43:25.720 --> 3:43:32.120]  to make the effort 110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack,
[3:43:32.120 --> 3:43:36.680]  attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists and just believe me ladies
[3:43:36.680 --> 3:43:39.960]  and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our
[3:43:39.960 --> 3:43:44.280]  futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with
[3:43:44.280 --> 3:43:48.680]  everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in this together
[3:43:48.680 --> 3:43:56.600]  infowarstore.com. Alex Jones here with two big announcements. Ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion

[3:44:48.280 --> 3:44:54.760]  together at infowarstore.com. Hanuman, if I'm pronouncing that right, what do you think is
[3:44:54.760 --> 3:44:58.520]  really going on? And thanks for calling. So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago. I was getting
[3:44:58.520 --> 3:45:02.680]  ready. I went to buy a bunch of part of the paper and some things before crowds really hit. And
[3:45:03.400 --> 3:45:07.720]  I had my phone, I had your show going on, sticking on my pocket so I could hear it. I wasn't even
[3:45:07.720 --> 3:45:11.880]  in headphones. This lady starts, who's who are you listening to? Who's that talking? I said,
[3:45:11.880 --> 3:45:16.920]  this is Alex Jones. And she just got her eyes got wide open and she says, really, I thought he was
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:22.120]  off the air. And I said, no, and I told her I explained, you know, the whole situation and
[3:45:22.120 --> 3:45:26.680]  told her where to go. She wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowords.com and just said
[3:45:26.680 --> 3:45:31.640]  she's still on. I run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and
[3:45:31.640 --> 3:45:35.240]  they go, Oh, Alex, I used to love you. I wish you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back
[3:45:35.240 --> 3:45:38.920]  on air? And I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[3:45:38.920 --> 3:45:42.920]  We have our own streams at infowords.com and band.video and they go, really, they said you were
[3:45:42.920 --> 3:45:48.360]  off the air because they took the platforming as off the air. No, we have our own platform,
[3:45:48.360 --> 3:45:55.240]  info wars, info wars, info wars. Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant streams of text
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:46:00.440]  messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[3:46:00.440 --> 3:46:04.680]  How bad is it really? So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, swirable foods. We
[3:46:04.680 --> 3:46:08.360]  have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food. It does take five
[3:46:08.360 --> 3:46:11.400]  to eight weeks to get it to you because they got a package and they got the food. But I want to
[3:46:11.400 --> 3:46:15.560]  encourage listeners to do the most important thing and that's drink purified water. That's
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:19.640]  a prey. That's get focused. That's not be stressed out because you're prepared and that's get DNA
[3:46:19.640 --> 3:46:24.520]  force plus the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest
[3:46:24.520 --> 3:46:29.480]  immune booster you can engage in. The X2, the X3, the foundation, everything. The ultra 12
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:34.120]  back in stock are nano silver, super silver, and super blue toothpaste. It's still 50% off.
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:39.720]  Turmeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells. We have the
[3:46:39.720 --> 3:46:43.800]  strongest turmeric you're going to find out there. 95% humanoid from bodies, open tumor forming with
[3:46:43.800 --> 3:46:47.480]  that's back in stock and purchases at infowarstore.com are the highest quality supplements,
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:55.800]  trouble food, and you actually get them delivered in stock at infowarstore.com. So get those today.
[3:47:17.480 --> 3:47:27.640]  Nick Baggage. And welcome back. You know, thinking about all this today and again just
[3:47:27.640 --> 3:47:32.520]  before the break, we were talking about supply chain interruptions, some of the things going on
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:42.360]  there. And earlier in the segments that preceded, Alex was going to ask me about genetic engineered
[3:47:42.360 --> 3:47:46.840]  bio weaponry. He didn't get around to it, so I want to make sure I don't miss that point.
[3:47:46.840 --> 3:47:53.640]  So to go back to that, you know, the idea that you could engineer a bio weapon for say race,
[3:47:53.640 --> 3:47:58.600]  that's something that Jim Rodger and I actually reported on. It was either an earth rising,
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:04.280]  the revolution, or rising to two of the books we wrote a number of years ago. In fact, the only
[3:48:04.280 --> 3:48:11.880]  place you can get those books is at the infowarstore. So check it out, get the books at the infowarstore,
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:15.400]  stock up on the other good things that are there. That's how the program is supported.
[3:48:15.400 --> 3:48:22.760]  We appreciate it. But it was back then, almost now 15, 18 years ago, that we were predicting
[3:48:24.040 --> 3:48:29.960]  this kind of technology because they were talking about within papers within the Pentagon that were
[3:48:29.960 --> 3:48:33.800]  being publicly released. They were talking about these sort of designer
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:43.400]  biologicals. So, you know, maybe that's that. Maybe that's this. But here's the thing. No matter
[3:48:43.400 --> 3:48:48.920]  what it is, there was one guy I met that did work for the Pentagon. He operated a think tank out of
[3:48:48.920 --> 3:48:54.840]  Arlington, Virginia. And his job was as a futurist, right? He was like this guy that predicted the
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:49:00.920]  future on stuff, you know, took weird scenarios and said, what if, you know, what if aliens landed
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:06.200]  on the White House lawn, for example, and that was one of them or like a hundred of these scenarios.
[3:49:06.200 --> 3:49:11.560]  What would you do? You know, what if the, you know, there was a massive volcanic eruption and
[3:49:11.560 --> 3:49:15.400]  there was this disaster? What would you do? You know, so they're all the, what would you do?
[3:49:16.040 --> 3:49:21.160]  And out of the hundred, what would you do? Is they made a rational plan about what would you do?
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:27.560]  How would you execute? What steps would you take? So they would have a playbook on the
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:32.120]  shelf. So you have a bad news day, you grab the playbook. Oh yeah, this is what we do.
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:37.560]  The aliens landed on the White House lawn or whatever the story is. You know, and I'm using
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:41.880]  that as a crazy example because these were the kind of examples that were there, the kind of
[3:49:41.880 --> 3:49:46.520]  things that were like out of the blue. In fact, the book was called out of the blue, as I recall.
[3:49:46.520 --> 3:49:56.760]  Go look it up. It's from 1990s, late 90s vintage. But the point is this idea of creating scenarios
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:02.360]  and then planning around them is what our military industrial complex, global complex,
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:09.240]  academic complex does. And then you build a scenario around that. What if you have that
[3:50:09.240 --> 3:50:13.000]  happen? What do you do? Now the Chinese are the masters of the game and they're the ones that
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:18.600]  got the lead role in the latest performance. And so when you think about what's happening there
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:24.360]  right now in terms of a lockdown, it gives you a whole new perspective on a billion population
[3:50:24.360 --> 3:50:29.320]  gulag, you know, and makes you understand why they were protesting in Hong Kong before all
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:34.360]  this started because they don't want it there. You know, and why Taiwan remains an island off the
[3:50:34.360 --> 3:50:39.480]  coast of China saying, hey, I know you think we belong in your territory, but we still feel kind
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:44.280]  of independent. And Hong Kong's kind of the same way and Singapore and some of the other places
[3:50:44.280 --> 3:50:50.360]  that are awful close to a lot of bad news. So you have a reshaping of what's happening there.
[3:50:50.360 --> 3:50:56.120]  Now people thinking in terms of the big games being played in the world that maybe it's time
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:51:00.920]  to bring factories back. But let's think about that for a moment when those factories return
[3:51:00.920 --> 3:51:05.000]  to America because they're going to be way different, you know, if and when they return.
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:10.120]  Because firstly, when they return, they're going to be robotically based after initially being built.
[3:51:10.840 --> 3:51:14.440]  They're not going to have the thousands of employees. They're going to have the dozens of
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:21.560]  employees. And then you have hardware equipment that's being developed that will take place of
[3:51:21.560 --> 3:51:26.760]  humans. Because cheaper to operate, you know, like the McDonald's robot that works for about
[3:51:26.760 --> 3:51:31.160]  three bucks an hour, you know, instead of whatever the minimum wage is and whatever part of the
[3:51:31.160 --> 3:51:37.560]  country you're in. And so when you start to think about, you know, what's happening with
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:45.080]  technology displacing labor, this is an important thing because this is capital replacing labor.
[3:51:45.080 --> 3:51:50.120]  You see, because there's four, four things in the economy that are real. There's labor,
[3:51:50.120 --> 3:51:54.200]  there's entrepreneurship, there's capital equipment, things that make things like
[3:51:54.200 --> 3:51:59.320]  factories or robots, you know, things that now make burgers. And there's land and natural
[3:51:59.320 --> 3:52:03.960]  resource, which is why I say stick the real stuff, man, you own your labor, you used to not even be
[3:52:03.960 --> 3:52:09.160]  able to pack that. They called that slavery until we created an amendment to the Constitution,
[3:52:09.160 --> 3:52:14.840]  let them create income tax. But that used to be, you know, kind of sacred. And then you've got
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:18.200]  entrepreneurship. And there's a lot of smart people. There's a lot of smart people listen to
[3:52:18.200 --> 3:52:24.680]  this broadcast every day that apply what they know and turn it into something that makes money.
[3:52:24.680 --> 3:52:29.480]  And then there's capital equipment, which is everything from a shovel to dig a ditch with,
[3:52:29.480 --> 3:52:34.360]  so that means you combine a shovel and your labor and you can go make a living, you know.
[3:52:34.360 --> 3:52:39.960]  I mean, capital equipment is the factory, the equipment. And that's real well, things that
[3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:45.560]  make things. Farmers all control their capital equipment and their land and their natural resources
[3:52:45.560 --> 3:52:51.320]  and their labor and their entrepreneurship. 90% of the American population 100 years ago were
[3:52:51.320 --> 3:53:00.440]  all of those things and controlled real well. Now you have a 401k, which is a pump. It's air.
[3:53:01.240 --> 3:53:06.200]  It's toilet paper. In fact, it's a rough toilet paper. You wouldn't even use it for that if the
[3:53:06.200 --> 3:53:10.520]  certificate wasn't worth anything. You might start a fire with it if it wasn't worth a thing.
[3:53:10.520 --> 3:53:16.200]  That's it. But the fact that you have a match and a lighter, that's capital equipment and the labor
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:21.960]  to light it, so at least you can make the fire. But the point of the matter is think about what
[3:53:21.960 --> 3:53:29.720]  has real value and begin rethinking how you play the game in terms of what do you put your money
[3:53:29.720 --> 3:53:37.160]  at and how do you manage what you have. And the sad story is we're kind of pushed into this 401k
[3:53:37.160 --> 3:53:46.920]  model. Well, social security gets looted. There is no security unless it's your own. And I think
[3:53:46.920 --> 3:53:51.160]  ultimately that's what we have to recognize. And so you take individual responsibility,
[3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:57.240]  which is what info war has always been about, is do we fall into the squishy collective
[3:53:58.520 --> 3:54:05.320]  of the Sanders world of collectivism in the 21st century? Or do we fall into the
[3:54:05.320 --> 3:54:13.560]  senile world of sleepy Joe? Come on, ladies and gentlemen, let's get back to draining the swamp,
[3:54:14.360 --> 3:54:19.960]  taking care of those things. We have these other things going on. I don't say disregard them,
[3:54:19.960 --> 3:54:27.080]  but remember all these other issues are still in full motion. And bad guys in the world like
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:35.240]  take opportunities like this to exploit when things are already a bit in chaos. It's opportunistic
[3:54:36.280 --> 3:54:42.280]  for the bad guys in the world, you know, this is the opportunity where you create more chaos
[3:54:42.280 --> 3:54:50.760]  and contrast. And I think that's where the calm voice in the middle of the storm needs to be ours
[3:54:50.760 --> 3:54:58.120]  also. Because everyone is nervous right now. I mean, think about it. Everyone's retirements,
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:03.480]  they've been watching bounce around like a yo-yo. There's no stability in anything,
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:10.360]  in any of it right now. And we see that. And so, you know, I mean, people are fearful for sure.
[3:55:10.360 --> 3:55:17.080]  That's what's driving all of it. And you hear me and you've heard me for years speaking against
[3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:23.880]  fear, because it is the root of the worst of possible human behavior is the fear.
[3:55:24.440 --> 3:55:32.040]  And what it does to our higher level processes, it breaks us off. It disconnects us
[3:55:33.240 --> 3:55:39.800]  from the infinite, from God. It disconnects us from who we are as created human beings
[3:55:40.600 --> 3:55:46.200]  when we fall into fear. So we can't allow that right now. And that's where so many people are
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:52.680]  right now. Prepare for sure. You know, you should be anyway, because life is always uncertain. It's
[3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:59.000]  a one certainty in it. You know, it's the one certainty in it. If you live long enough, you
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:04.440]  know it. Because you've seen the cycles come and go. And when you thought, oh, the sky is falling,
[3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:10.040]  the world is ending, it didn't. And I would bet it's not going to end now. But it certainly
[3:56:10.040 --> 3:56:15.880]  is altered by every event. But mainly by the way we perceive it, react to it and begin responding.
[3:56:15.880 --> 3:56:23.080]  And you now have a collective responding to a wave in the matrix. I was at Costco the other day
[3:56:23.080 --> 3:56:27.000]  myself, you know, before this thing started and everybody's calm, you know, doing the thing.
[3:56:27.560 --> 3:56:32.040]  And then I went after it started and people were very, it was quietest day I'd ever been to Costco
[3:56:32.040 --> 3:56:37.240]  for the busiest day on the planet. It was kind of wild. But here's what I saw. Those that knew
[3:56:37.240 --> 3:56:41.880]  what they were doing had a certain determination. The rest were walking around like deers in the
[3:56:41.880 --> 3:56:49.400]  headline. Gee, what's going on? How come everybody's shopping today? Well, most people that reminded
[3:56:49.400 --> 3:56:56.440]  me don't pay attention to anything at all. And it's always a big surprise because we're
[3:56:56.440 --> 3:57:00.840]  everybody's looking through the narrow news feed. And I've said it before and I say it again,
[3:57:00.840 --> 3:57:07.560]  take a broad view, look at everybody's news feed, make your own mind up, don't be pushed along,
[3:57:07.560 --> 3:57:13.640]  don't be hurted and don't succumb to fear. We are created in the image of a creator. We should act
[3:57:13.640 --> 3:57:19.000]  like or begin at least asking for the grace that we might behave in this different way,
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:23.960]  that we might see the world in a different way. That going into a weekend when the world is going
[3:57:23.960 --> 3:57:30.040]  to be filled with fear and anxiety. Yeah, we have problems. They're going to be here for a while.
[3:57:30.040 --> 3:57:35.960]  But hey, we're not in this alone. We're not in this alone. You're the tip of the sphere. Remember
[3:57:35.960 --> 3:57:40.200]  who you are and act that way. This is Dr. Nick Beggis signing off.
