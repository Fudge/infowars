[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30.000 --> 00:54.000]  My friends, it is the 30th day of June 2013. I am your host Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every single Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[00:54.000 --> 01:08.000]  Wayne Madsen is going to be joining us in the second hour for three of the segments. Wayne did work at the National Security Agency. He's testified to Congress before about illegal spying over a decade ago.
[01:08.000 --> 01:37.000]  And Wayne was in a big London Guardian article yesterday that got pulled from the Guardian and the Observer, one of the biggest group of publications in the U.K. It got pulled, and then at the same time they even went into the Google system, which I've never seen before, and took it out of the Google wayback machine.
[01:37.000 --> 01:50.000]  In fact, if we punch up my middle computer, folks can see it there. If you're watching on prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com, we now offer the radio show free everybody while we can pay for the bandwidth.
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  And subscribers get the nightly news and all the films. The rest of it, our goal is just to get the word out, period.
[01:55.000 --> 02:11.000]  And that's why we're putting that out so people can actually see it if you're a radio listener. But shocking NSA scoop on Saturday, the Guardian revealed a major NSA scoop, then deleted it from their website.
[02:11.000 --> 02:20.000]  I saw this in the business insider this morning, posted up on infowars.com, so I called Wayne. And on his site, he has it archived, but other than that, it's gone.
[02:20.000 --> 02:31.000]  You click on the Google wayback machine and I actually searched the article headline in a fresh search of their site. I clicked on this this morning and it was there.
[02:31.000 --> 02:40.000]  It's now gone, ladies and gentlemen. That's the type of stuff that is going on.
[02:40.000 --> 02:51.000]  Now continuing here. Look at it. There's the Wayne Madsen right there revealed secret European deals to hand over private data to America. This has been known forever.
[02:51.000 --> 03:01.000]  That this has been declassified over and over again. That is called info poll nine basically over Europe. And it's the same grid.
[03:01.000 --> 03:10.000]  And they all share and Europeans can then listen to us. So see the Europeans are out in the press going out there America. We would never put up with this.
[03:10.000 --> 03:22.000]  I saw an article two years ago where a guy was in France and he said, man, this is the bomb going to this sporting event. And he was arrested.
[03:22.000 --> 03:32.000]  And then you've seen examples of Europeans coming over here and others saying, man, we're coming to America to tear the place down. Here comes the FBI.
[03:32.000 --> 03:43.000]  They're reading the emails, the text listening. That is on record. They're only going after Snowden and people because they're saying it's morally wrong.
[03:43.000 --> 03:52.000]  So they're really going after their free speech. They're going after Greenwald speech interviewing somebody like Snowden and having David Gregory on NBC say arresting.
[03:52.000 --> 04:01.000]  And it is disgusting. So there it is revealed secret European deals to hand over private data to America. That's up on info wars.com.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  And then we're linked to the new article to Wayne Madsen. I'm putting out a report today responding to all this. It is a big deal.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  You know, we tend to have Wayne on so much every few months. People think, oh, that's just Wayne Madsen. Folks, he worked at the NSA.
[04:14.000 --> 04:24.000]  He worked before that in Navy security. And he worked in the Naval War College. And he has testified to Congress and he has the sources.
[04:24.000 --> 04:36.000]  And he just, it's just, but he's going after a European commission that admitted a decade ago and James Vanford's book 12 years ago, Body of Secrets and Exposed Operation Northwoods, among other things.
[04:36.000 --> 04:48.000]  So he'll be joining us. We've got all the other news first, though. We've got reports out there right now. They're planning massive rioting.
[04:48.000 --> 04:59.000]  What did that story go? Megaviral folks are planning that if Zimmerman doesn't get convicted, we'll be covering that and a lot more. Stay with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:10.000]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver based products.
[05:10.000 --> 05:22.000]  Our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions. Our two ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all natural silver soaps.
[05:22.000 --> 05:34.000]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[05:34.000 --> 05:46.000]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[05:46.000 --> 05:59.000]  Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver based products are best for you. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  Here are the highlights of the Info War.
[06:46.000 --> 07:06.000]  Again, folks, coming up in the second hour, a real NSA insider, whistleblower, will be joining us, Wayne Madsen.
[07:06.000 --> 07:17.000]  A big cover story in the London Guardian Slash Observer came out yesterday and was denoticed by the British government.
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  They have national security declarations over there where they can shut the press down. Very authoritarian.
[07:22.000 --> 07:37.000]  Under the so-called US government request, they have been slapping down scores of mainstream media reports about illegal spying and how Europe and the UK is working with the criminals that run our government to engage in this type of activity.
[07:37.000 --> 07:54.000]  And Wayne Madsen's story that was up on the Guardian, there was not a retraction, there was not anything. It went out in the print edition of the newspaper nationwide and into Europe. It's one of the biggest English speaking papers in Europe, if not the biggest.
[07:54.000 --> 08:03.000]  It went out, but they removed it off of the online and we have screenshots of it at the bottom of the article on infowars.com.
[08:03.000 --> 08:16.000]  They removed it and now they have removed it from the Google cache system that I've never seen Google remove something from its cache.
[08:16.000 --> 08:28.000]  So that has all been disappeared and we have links to that you can see up on infowars.com and exclusively Wayne Madsen will be joining us.
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.000]  He's talked to the newspaper, it was the government, quote, putting pressure on them to remove it.
[08:34.000 --> 08:48.000]  But as Madsen pointed out over the phone, I said, well, wait, the stuff you talk about, you're smart, like Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars program, the weaponized space system before that Colonel Bowman in the Air Force.
[08:48.000 --> 08:58.000]  You're smart, like that engineer, nuclear physicist Bob Bowman, he'll come on and talk about space weapons, but only what's been accidentally leaked by other people.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  Only what's been gotten out by the press in the past, he can come out and say what's accurate and what isn't.
[09:04.000 --> 09:16.000]  And he talked about on C-SPAN debating the current head of the Star Wars program in the late 80s and the guy got real angry with him and started releasing a bunch of classified stuff.
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  And so he was then able to talk about that because his former colleague got angry and was blurting it out.
[09:24.000 --> 09:38.000]  And the truth is, it's like General Petraeus as the head of the CIA last year now defrocked, disgraced, kicked out in one of those interagency wars was at a technology conference put on by Wired Magazine.
[09:38.000 --> 09:48.000]  And he said, look, we got wireless internet looking through your walls. He said, look, all your new appliances have microphones, cameras, your dishwashers watching you.
[09:48.000 --> 09:56.000]  And of course, we're listening to everything you're doing, but it's for your safety.
[09:56.000 --> 10:10.000]  So because he was promoting it from a perspective of this spying illegally is good for you.
[10:10.000 --> 10:20.000]  And to keep you safe from the bad men, like we're two years old and really believe these fairy tales, then you don't go to jail.
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.000]  But if you're Edward Snowden and you come out and you say, hey, they're spying on everybody illegally.
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  These are the programs that are in place. And I think it's terrible and I can't go on living like this anymore.
[10:35.000 --> 10:47.000]  Then they've got to call you a traitor and an enemy and a piece of trash and say you've endangered America and get all sick of panic about national security.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  When the globalists are the ones destroying our industry, our sovereignty and our security.
[10:53.000 --> 11:10.000]  So I'm going to talk to the people out there like David Gregory of Meet the Press who with extreme salivation had green wall of the Guardian on last Sunday and said, hey, you ought to be arrested.
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  We played the clip last Sunday. You ought to be arrested. You know, maybe you should be arrested. And I mean, this is so outrageous.
[11:18.000 --> 11:25.000]  The spying is illegal on record without warrants.
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  This is part of the war on journalists. They're using the NSA on the Associated Press and on Fox News.
[11:31.000 --> 11:40.000]  They're arresting members of the State Department that talk to Fox News or to this show for that matter.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  People go to the State Department, to the cafeteria, meet with them and go, what's your view as a top analyst on North Korea?
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  Are they capable of, you think, really launching a nuclear weapon at Japan?
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  Well, yes, we think they're crazy enough. They are unstable enough to do it and we don't think they're planning to, but they are dangerous and we believe they have three weapons.
[12:01.000 --> 12:14.000]  I mean, that's in the newspaper. And they went and arrested that guy and are talking about charging the Fox News head national security reporter.
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  And that was in the news a month ago. And then they take Snowden. There's a bunch of whistleblowers. There's been AT&T NSA whistleblowers.
[12:22.000 --> 12:31.000]  There's been a ton of them. James Bamford interviewed a bunch of whistleblowers and brought out more than Snowden did 12 years ago in Body of Secrets.
[12:31.000 --> 12:43.000]  We interviewed him. And mainly what he did was go and dig through the National Security Archives and then go and talk to retired people about what they could tell them about things in the archives.
[12:43.000 --> 12:59.000]  And mainly it was our so-called government shipping narcotics around the world, our so-called government running sex slavery, white slavery, our so-called government staging terror attacks to blame foreign governments and take American liberty.
[12:59.000 --> 13:08.000]  That came out in ABC News, by the way. James Bamford used to be the producer, the news director of Nightline.
[13:08.000 --> 13:18.000]  Oh, you didn't know they've declassified over 200 instances of the U.S. Army blowing stuff up to blame an enemy.
[13:18.000 --> 13:37.000]  I mean, our military says, well, we do this because other people do. Yeah, I guess other people do. Operation Hemler was more than a dozen stage terror attacks to be blamed on Poland and countries like that to start World War II.
[13:37.000 --> 13:47.000]  I guess Operation Hemler did really work well for a while.
[13:47.000 --> 14:01.000]  So this is the type of stuff I deal with and that we all deal with when we're informed is hearing other talk show hosts literally shallivate on air going Richard Snowden or Edward Snowden, you know, as a trader.
[14:01.000 --> 14:12.000]  And all these people need to be arrested and we need to go after them and and we need to go after people that try to hurt America and all this business.
[14:12.000 --> 14:25.000]  He didn't give out ICBM information. He didn't give out cruise missile information. He didn't give out how many knots an aircraft carrier can move or steam as they call it.
[14:25.000 --> 14:36.000]  Not even though it's nuclear power, they call it steam. I guess they call it cruise now. He didn't give out the classified speed of an Abrams M1A1 tank.
[14:36.000 --> 14:54.000]  They didn't give any of that out. He came out and said, we are spying on everybody in the middle of a huge scandal where they were caught spying on the press and caught spying on the on the House cloakroom and the Senate cloakroom where people go to eat their lunch.
[14:54.000 --> 15:02.000]  The Justice Department has stinking microphones planted in there. Totally illegal. Totally illegal.
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  And all of this comes out, ladies and gentlemen, and we've known this before. MI6 has been caught spying on the British Parliament.
[15:10.000 --> 15:26.000]  The democracies and the special interests that control them are out of control. And that's the big national security threat is the 800 and 60 plus thousand private contractors with top secret and above top secret clearance.
[15:26.000 --> 15:37.000]  Most of them foreign owned companies here in the U.S. who have access to all the NSA data. Snowden worked for a private company.
[15:37.000 --> 15:49.000]  It happened to be American. The point is, these are globalists that have taken over. They're dialed into all this and they're really using it for unfair trade advantage against companies that aren't on the inside scoop.
[15:49.000 --> 16:00.000]  It'd be like having a bug in your competition's office. Okay, we're going to come back and break down the latest on the NSA scandal that a bunch of other news.
[16:00.000 --> 16:10.000]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives. Nature regularly sends us destructive storms. 24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[16:10.000 --> 16:20.000]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve. The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.

[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  All of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game.

[20:01.000 --> 20:09.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:31.000 --> 20:51.000]  You think you've got private lives folks? Think nothing of the kind. There is no true escape. Big brothers watching all the time.
[20:51.000 --> 21:01.000]  The only escape is not being intimidated by all this and standing up to the criminal interest that have hijacked our nation and restoring our republic.
[21:01.000 --> 21:13.000]  Now I want to get into a bunch of important crime news. The bizarre statements of Alec Baldwin just because it shows the hypocrisy of the authoritarian left as I call them.
[21:13.000 --> 21:25.000]  We're going to get into U.S. military buildups not just in Jordan but also in Israel by Gaza and it's not even really getting any press here in the U.S.
[21:25.000 --> 21:37.000]  I mean it's in Reuters, it's in France 24 on their national TV but I've been monitoring TV and press here. There's very little coverage of it. It's a big deal.
[21:37.000 --> 21:49.000]  Here's the headline. Jordanian suspicious about U.S. military deployment. The government it says is the U.S. had a drill there and then a month ago and then refused to leave.
[21:49.000 --> 21:58.000]  It's pretty bizarre. So we're going to be looking at that. We're going to be again in depth looking at the NSA but here's what I want to get across to everybody.
[21:58.000 --> 22:16.000]  We've all heard stories and seen convictions in news where 20 year old companies, 150 year old companies, 200 year old companies in some cases in Europe or older were the CEO or the CFO or the president of the company
[22:16.000 --> 22:32.000]  or a managing director gets caught doing something illegal with the company robbing thousands of people or overcharging millions or cheating or using company transport to ship in drugs.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  You've all seen countless articles and stories like that in the press.
[22:37.000 --> 22:52.000]  There's a lot of examples of it. It doesn't mean that everyone in the company is a criminal. It doesn't mean everybody that works for the organization is bad.
[22:52.000 --> 23:03.000]  When you get a bunch of people in a company operating as criminals, then you can call it organized crime.
[23:03.000 --> 23:16.000]  And when you look at our government and many other governments, I mean, most people will say, oh, well, most governments are corrupt in our tyrannies and our oligarchies.
[23:16.000 --> 23:29.000]  Most governments are wildly corrupt and the police are oppressive and there's a surveillance state and there's checkpoints on the road and the police will rob you if they want or take blood from you at checkpoints.
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  Or when you start going down the list, you're like, wow, that's a lot of places in America.
[23:35.000 --> 23:46.000]  And anyone who's honest will tell you America is declining culturally, spiritually, mentally in very, very many ways and it's accelerating.
[23:46.000 --> 23:56.000]  And when you try to stand up against that decline, you get demonized by the mainstream media and you get demonized by a lot of the politicos that are out there.
[23:56.000 --> 24:02.000]  Because they've got a lot riding on America going quietly into the night.
[24:02.000 --> 24:12.000]  They've got a lot riding on the people standing down.
[24:12.000 --> 24:31.000]  And really all the new world order is, is a private, global, corporate takeover. And Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carol Quigley and Rothkopf and Henry Kissinger and countless others have all written books.
[24:31.000 --> 24:42.000]  Helmut Schmidt, the German Chancellor, Men in Powers, a political retrospective, there are countless books I've personally read where they announced their global corporate government.
[24:42.000 --> 25:00.000]  And where they brag for 50, 60 years that they're above the law, they have diplomatic immunity, that the government ships in the narcotics, that the government runs every bad vice and that select corporate individuals make the money off of it.
[25:00.000 --> 25:12.000]  But it's good because they're altruistic and they're only running the criminal enterprises so that bad people don't get control of it.
[25:12.000 --> 25:21.000]  See, they're in control of it because they'll make sure that it doesn't hurt innocent people that didn't ask for it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  And what I'm giving you is the secrets of organized crime here.
[25:26.000 --> 25:38.000]  The mindset, the way it works, the way they think, and they all write books bragging how they're doing it and saying, hey, we're in control, we deserve to be in control.
[25:38.000 --> 25:46.000]  I've been approached by some of these guys on record and off record and said, look, the public would tear you limb from limb.
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  They don't want freedom. You ought to join us.
[25:51.000 --> 26:03.000]  Well, I don't believe that. With the culture they sell, the dumbing down, the propaganda, all of that undoubtedly.
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  We have a decadent wicked society and the general public is a howling, dangerous mob of miscreants on average.
[26:11.000 --> 26:26.000]  But there is a large segment of society and I think bordering on a majority that is hardworking, smart, good, decent, but they're overwhelmed by the complexity of the world, overwhelmed by the magnitude of the corruption.
[26:26.000 --> 26:32.000]  And they believe that they'd have to be able to fix the whole world with one magic button or lever they throw.
[26:32.000 --> 26:46.000]  And that's not how the universe works. But simply put, the New World Order is a corporate, hostile takeover of not just the US, but every other country in the world.
[26:46.000 --> 26:55.000]  It is 2,000 major companies. This is all mainstream news now that have access to most of the NSA data.
[26:55.000 --> 27:04.000]  It is the Fortune 100 roughly and Google and Microsoft and Apple and AT&T and Verizon on record that are the NSA.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  They have the data centers. They administer the government centers, but most of it's in their centers.
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  And I told you this a decade ago. I told you this 17 years ago because it's all public.
[27:15.000 --> 27:22.000]  Wayne Madsen's coming on. He simply pointed to the Guardian. Here's the European Union Commission from a decade ago admitting this.
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  When James Bamford's book came out on the NSA, the former head producer of Nightline.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  Here's all the documents. Here's the name of the programs. Here's how they do it. Here's how they run it.
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.000]  And they shut that article down after less than 24 hours and even took it off Google Cash, folks.
[27:40.000 --> 27:46.000]  And you know why they did? Because Wayne Madsen just walked out and said the emperor has no clothes.
[27:46.000 --> 27:57.000]  This is all public. This is in the Telecommunications Act of 96 in the US. This is in your Telecommunications Acts of 1997, 2003 in Europe.
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  And they totally freaked out, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  You see, they like it when Snowden's running and scared because they can then act like he did something wrong.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  They can get everybody to buy into it and call the guy a traitor when he is a hero.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  And they can have others call him a double agent. That guy's not a double agent.
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  He's a double agent of the globalist. He's not like Lee Harvey Oswald. They sent to Russia to defect or something.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  I've studied it. I know what I've seen every angle.
[28:28.000 --> 28:37.000]  He's one of many people that tried to get away from this evil who they decided to pick as a cut out to then make the double agent
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  out of him and trying to scare everybody. And tell you, yeah, we're listening to you.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  And yeah, we torture people. And yeah, we ship in the drugs. What you going to do about it?
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  You see? Now, I'm done talking about that to the next hour.

[32:17.000 --> 32:22.000]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine,
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.000]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it,
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  they can take total control of your awareness.

[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  eclipse operation, fast and furious.
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  They go out and find people that they pressure to go out and commit crimes with illegal guns.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  So they can then point at that and call for all of us to lose our guns,
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.000]  as their own internal memos showed on fast and furious, where they ship thousands of guns into Mexico
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  to then blame the Second Amendment when crimes were committed with them.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  That's called a false flag event.
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  I'll be getting to that more in just a moment and a bunch of other news I haven't covered yet.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  But first off, the July issue of Info Wars Magazine is in.

[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  I mean, the little ones are medium size to put on your own property or legal and awful areas.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  Talk about an Info Wars bomb in the Info War.

[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking 10 bumper stickers.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  What did you guys just do in there?
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  Because my audio suddenly got clear.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  I was telling you my audio had been kind of low in my earpiece.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  And it just suddenly clicked in and then I could hear it good.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  Wow, that was amazing.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  That was like the sun coming back or something.
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  Wow, it was driving me crazy and I'd be able to hear it barely.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  That was neat.

[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  Spread the word about this broadcast.

[38:24.000 --> 38:31.000]  If you're listening to us on 1530 or the 160 plus AM and FM affiliates across the land.
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.000]  Okay, I'm done with the daily plug there, but that's also how we fund our operation.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  Let me get to this thing that I just mentioned here.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  And I'm going to get Larry Pratt on this week.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  I've got owners of America to break it down.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  But ATF arming robbers and hatching plots leaving many dead.
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.000]  ATF domestic sting operations eclipse operation fast and furious.
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.000]  And sting operations similar to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which left six dead.
[39:02.000 --> 39:10.000]  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are pressuring and arming people to rob fictitious drug stash houses.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  And the bust have left at least seven people dead, according to USA Today.
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  Now, remember our government on record, the banks that have hijacked it, ship in most of the narcotics.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  Even Bloomberg reports that they run the guns, the drug cartels, all of it.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  So they need low level idiots to bust for the media to make it look like they've done something.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  And it just goes on with a lot of legal scholars, constitutionalists saying this is illegal.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  This is beyond entrapment and it's very, very dangerous.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  And it's then used to blame the Second Amendment.
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  It's then used. In fact, it came out. They've used these cases and anti-gun stuff on TV.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  And as we learn more and more, it'll get even worse, of course, just like fast and furious.
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  Which CBS News with their credit got the internal memos from higher ups and cover this up.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  We're going to use this to go after the guns.
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.000]  Well, of course, I said that before it came out. Of course, they were already on the news when Obama got elected.
[40:08.000 --> 40:15.000]  They were already on the news in 2009 going, we've got to turn our guns in. We've got to ban semi-autos.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  They're being used in Mexico. We've got gun tracker programs.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  That's how we know the White House was lying because it turned out they had directed it.
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.000]  And before they got caught arming the cartels, they said, oh yeah, we're tracking the guns in this program.
[40:29.000 --> 40:37.000]  You bet you were tracking them. You were giving them the guns because the drug cartels are buying full auto and buying armored vehicles.
[40:37.000 --> 40:45.000]  And having Goldman Sachs, you know, type megabanks, launder the money, it's come out with all these big Federal Reserve connected banks.
[40:45.000 --> 40:55.000]  Mainly, Wacovia and Wells Fargo, the ones that have been busted with the hundreds of billions of drug money and specifically running the aircraft, the weapons.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  You name it to them.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  When's the last time you heard about a big Federal Reserve shareholding bank?
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  Because all the big six banks own share in the Federal Reserve, the private offshore Federal Reserve.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  And just go into your Lexus Nexus if you're a reporter.
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  And type in Federal Reserve Bank, you know, 6 billion in drug money, 20 billion in drug money.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  You'll see it all the time, but nobody gets in trouble.
[41:20.000 --> 41:30.000]  Instead, they'll raid some dilapidated drughouse just a few times a year per city to make it look like they're doing something.
[41:30.000 --> 41:39.000]  Our government has been involved in the drug trade taxing it since it was legal in 1789.
[41:39.000 --> 41:47.000]  Cocaine, opium, ladenum, then heroin after the 1860s when they invented purifying it.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  The derivative of opium.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  All of it.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  Just shipping it in in mass on record.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  The CIA Solicitor General, 1997, look it up.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  Congressional hearings admitted it.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  This is a public secret.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  A public secret.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  There's Forbes, is the Federal Reserve using money laundering techniques to cleanse banks balance sheets?
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  I don't know, do bears go poo poo in the woods?
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  I mean, is Charlie Manson a lunatic?
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Is Bill Clinton a liar?
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  Does Superman have a red cape?
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  Does the Easter Bunny a bunny?
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  Do turtles have shells?
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  Are Ewoks stupid and ruin the turn of the Jedi?
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  Ha ha ha.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  Oh my goodness, it's already time to go to break again.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  All right, we'll be back.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  I'm going to shut up.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  I'm going to get into the really big news after that.
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  U.S. on alert for possible fireworks bombs.
[42:42.000 --> 42:49.000]  Nanny Cam home invader who assaulted mother in front of her child was known to have entered a neighbor's home,
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  but no one did anything.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  He had four burglary convictions and just been let out of prison.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  Obama compares Nelson Mandela, a hardcore communist, to George Washington.
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.000]  It's all coming up.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[43:05.000 --> 43:12.000]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[43:41.000 --> 43:47.000]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[47:01.000 --> 47:10.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:10.000 --> 47:21.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of The Resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:21.000 --> 47:45.000]  You know in England they are moving to ban without a license having any type of sharp knives, even for chefs, because someone might do something bad with a knife.
[47:45.000 --> 47:54.000]  Why not ban cars? Someone might run people over with cars. Look out. They're coming out with the new Mercedes and things where the car won't let you do stuff like that, supposedly.
[47:54.000 --> 48:04.000]  But then if an unnamed agency or individual wants to hack into your Mercedes and drive it off the road in a fireball, they can, can't they?
[48:04.000 --> 48:16.000]  By the way, I had the Rolling Stones editor's army buddy that he was embedded with off and on for years, one of his best friends on the show, and he thinks they probably killed him.
[48:16.000 --> 48:25.000]  He was at the funeral. The wife of Michael Hastings thinks they probably killed him, and she says, I'll bring down whoever did this, and they said that he was being death-threaded by the army.
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.000]  And that was the biggest story ever, and he was going into hiding two hours before his car blew up, witnesses said, and then flew off the road into a tree.
[48:34.000 --> 48:44.000]  And that has been out in the news now for six days, breaking on my show, and no one that I've seen has covered it.
[48:44.000 --> 48:52.000]  I mean, even if we're crazy to question him being blown up, you know, when the army's going, you're dead for what you've released. We're going to kill you.
[48:52.000 --> 49:02.000]  And it turns out, it's not just hearsay on my show. He wrote that in one of his books, but he was getting death threats the day he died and said, I'm going into hiding, and then his car blows up.
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.000]  I'm getting death threats. I'm going into hiding. Biggest story ever. In Peril trips out of the base. Peril trips out of the base.
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  I mean, it's to continue the cheesy Star Wars analogies.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  I'm waiting for him to say at the 50th anniversary that Kennedy wasn't even assassinated.
[49:17.000 --> 49:28.000]  In fact, you're a conspiracy theorist. If you say he was killed, period. A nat did that to him. A nat was a convertible. They were going too fast.
[49:28.000 --> 49:36.000]  We were in Texas, big gnats here. Everything's bigger. Like the gnats in the cartoon, the big sharp nose blew his head clean off.
[49:36.000 --> 49:50.000]  Blew the brains all over Jackie's pretty little dress. I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you, that's what mainstream news says. I'm sticking to it. I'm not going to question anything.
[49:50.000 --> 49:57.000]  Vince Foster, you know, witnesses saw him dragging a dead body out there and Hillary cleaned out his office and all the witnesses.
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.000]  He was shot in the top of the head. Hey, a lot of people wrap themselves up in a carpet and take themselves and throw themselves in a park.
[50:05.000 --> 50:16.000]  I'm going with that. And I think Richard, Richard, was it Edward? I keep saying Richard Snowden. It's Edward Snowden.
[50:16.000 --> 50:30.000]  You know what? I'm teleprompter free. That's going to happen. But let's get to the really big threat. Every time there's any event going on, Christmas, New Year's, Halloween, 4th of July,
[50:30.000 --> 50:36.000]  we've got to hear the terrorists are planning to hit us and oh, the Army's going to be out of events all over the country.
[50:36.000 --> 50:43.000]  And the TSA is going to be in cities all over the nation, randomly searching people on the roads and at the terminals now.
[50:43.000 --> 50:54.000]  And Bloomberg wants to ban fireworks in New York State, not because they can burn stuff down, but because you heard it, folks, the terrorists might get them and make a bomb out of them.
[50:54.000 --> 51:06.000]  Just like we got to ban knives. I mean, you know, you can't be trusted. Now, government can have nuclear weapons and missiles and tanks and armored vehicles and two billion bullets and be training to take on gun owners and tea partiers.
[51:06.000 --> 51:12.000]  But that's okay.
[51:12.000 --> 51:27.000]  U.S. on alert for possible fireworks bombs. Here's UPI security officials. They're not servants, they're officials. Said U.S. police should be on the alert. But for al-Qaeda, you gave 10,000 heat seeking missiles in Syria.
[51:27.000 --> 51:35.000]  You got all the neighbors freaked out, even the pro West Jordanians are freaked out. They're like, why are you bringing al-Qaeda in by the, you know, it's over 100,000.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  They're saying into our area and giving them heat seeking missiles while they dance around saying we're going to blow up more, more buildings.
[51:42.000 --> 51:56.000]  We publish these videos and we post them on info wars.com. Every day, cutting people's heads off, cutting their hearts out, blowing up synagogues, blowing up churches, blowing up Shiite mosque that these Wahhabis don't like.
[51:56.000 --> 52:10.000]  Our government has brought over 100,000 in any one time. It was 60. Now it's over 100,000 to attack Syria who did nothing and who's secular, a Bathis regime.
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  But oh, we got a ban on fireworks. Jiminy Crickets. I mean, al-Qaeda is going to blow us up.
[52:17.000 --> 52:26.000]  You're like, well, Alex, the Boston bombing. Oh, the Boston bombing. You got FBI agents being killed that were involved arresting the Patsy brother.
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.000]  You've got their other witness. I'm shooting him in the top of the head admitting he didn't even resist him now.
[52:31.000 --> 52:39.000]  You've got the older brother sent by the CIA to infiltrate al-Qaeda groups. That's been confirmed. He worked for the State Department.
[52:39.000 --> 52:47.000]  I mean, double agents bare minimum. They blew up what they probably thought were just a part of a drill. Turns out there was a drill, like I told you.
[52:47.000 --> 52:56.000]  No wonder they're on national TV saying, do not look at info wars.com. Remember that at the press conferences?
[52:56.000 --> 53:08.000]  It goes on and on and on and on. The United States has been hijacked by foreign banks that run al-Qaeda. It's criminal elements inside the government, steering and piloting it.
[53:08.000 --> 53:17.000]  It's like these science fiction movies where the slug climbs in your ear, rath a con or host, and then controls you.
[53:17.000 --> 53:26.000]  Maybe people can get an analogy or an allegory. It's not our government. It's criminal interest. They're always talking about national security.
[53:26.000 --> 53:37.000]  National security means they can commit all their crimes. National security means they can shut down cold plants here and move them to China with no environmental standards to build widgets cheaper than we can.
[53:37.000 --> 53:44.000]  National security means they can get away with unlimited crimes against our republic.
[53:44.000 --> 53:57.000]  A bunch of foreign companies and a whole bunch of foreign countries have access to your emails, your text, your phone calls. They're all sharing this data.
[53:57.000 --> 54:08.000]  Europe, the UK, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the Anglo-American global empire. And it's called that because of the Anglo-American combines, not meaning white people.
[54:08.000 --> 54:20.000]  It means the robber baron index of the British East India, Dutch East India company, model of a corporate empire above the law, exempt from taxes, and we aren't.
[54:20.000 --> 54:36.000]  We're not part of the club. So many good old boys, black, white, Hispanic, I don't care, go USA, USA, no matter what the crimes are of this government, bipartisan, because they feel like when they're carpet bombing some villagers in Africa or the Middle East or Asia,
[54:36.000 --> 54:44.000]  that that's our manliness and you're part of it. You pay for it. You don't get the spoils. Our gas prices went up after the Iraq war.
[54:44.000 --> 55:00.000]  It was done because Saddam was selling too much oil and driving down the prices. Go look up the first Gulf War. OPEC was pulling. The Saudis were beside themselves over him driving down the price of oil to pay off his debts.
[55:00.000 --> 55:16.000]  From the Iran-Iraq war that he went $35 billion to the U.S. in to get the nerve gas. The CIA and U.S. satellites were running that war against Iran. The U.S. told him, yeah, go ahead and invade Kuwait to pay us off.
[55:16.000 --> 55:36.000]  They set him up. April Gillespie, the U.S. ambassador. Then they went on TV and called him Saddam Hussein, which means, you know what Saddam means? That's an Arabic word.
[55:36.000 --> 55:53.000]  Saddam. They went on there so there was no way he could back off. He was a U.S. CIA full-bore, trained in Egypt, U.S. government agent. Saddam Hussein on record was put in power in 1979 by the U.S. government.
[55:53.000 --> 56:06.000]  He was trained as an army captain in the late 1950s. Look it up. And I'm not a fan of Saddam Hussein, but they tell him to attack Iran. He doesn't. They tell him invade Kuwait to get the money to pay him back. He doesn't. They set him up.
[56:06.000 --> 56:18.000]  This is disgusting to put a bunch of radicals in the Middle East. They're removing secular leaders like him. I don't care how many HBO shows you show where he's a bad guy. It's so childlike.
[56:18.000 --> 56:32.000]  They go, here's the villain. And we're supposed to go, oh, there's the villain. Here, let's look at some more articles here. The slugs, the globalist slugs that are above the law that climb on our country's collective brains and then run us like automatons.
[56:32.000 --> 56:42.000]  And you're like, USA, USA. USA is a foreign banking combine that wants to enslave you and is deindustrializing America. Let me show you this.
[56:42.000 --> 56:55.000]  Obama compares Nelson Mandela to George Washington. I have never seen something that disgusting, ladies and gentlemen. Nelson Mandela, they tagged on to the anti-apartheid movement, which I think was good.
[56:55.000 --> 57:06.000]  He was a hardcore communist mass bomber. His wife says her favorite thing to do is hang tires over children's heads and necklace them. I mean, he's just a horrible person. He's certainly not George Washington.
[57:06.000 --> 57:20.000]  Look at this. NFL declines to promote Obamacare. That's some good news. Can Wi-Fi let you see through people's walls? See that news. That's CBS. And then it goes on to tell you what I already told you.
[57:20.000 --> 57:31.000]  But they don't tell you the Xbox. That's how it looks through your walls. The new Xbox Connect. The Microsoft has cameras, microphones, face scanning technology, and wireless.
[57:31.000 --> 57:45.000]  They had ground penetrating radar 30 years ago. That's all this is. They have better sensors now. These Google blimps they're launching have this. And they look right through your walls, black and white image of you in bed with your wife on the toilet.
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  You name it, baby. You name it. Second hour coming up.
[57:50.000 --> 58:02.000]  Calben soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils.

[59:07.000 --> 59:15.000]  This helps to reduce the workload of your already overworked immune system and allows the immune system to refocus its energy and recharge.
[59:15.000 --> 59:25.000]  Supernatural silver can help combat over 300 different conditions and it has the ability to kill over 143 types of bacteria, viruses, mold and yeast.
[59:25.000 --> 59:37.000]  Supernatural silver's patented technology includes advanced scientific research with over 180 scientific studies conducted at independent universities, hospitals, research institutions and nursing homes.
[59:37.000 --> 59:58.000]  To see how Supernatural Silver can change your life, go to SupernaturalSilver.com. Use the promo code Silver2013 for 20% off and like us on Facebook.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  Supernatural Silver continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  And this has got the system so upset as I said earlier they have taken down the London Guardian slash London Observer article to twin newspapers and even expunge the Google cache.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  And they haven't done a retraction saying we removed the article because it was wrong. They've been denoticed which is over in England. The government can tell them to take something down. They have to do it.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  But has it broken the US papers on Thursday and Friday? Our government, the leech globalist, are ordering the headquarters of the leech globalist London to remove this stuff.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  Or probably London ordered its minions in the US to then make the request so it wasn't too obvious who's running things. No attack on the British people by the way. You just were a prominent powerful island so the globalist moved in and took over your country and have made you the system to take over the rest of the planet.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  And I for one just want to reverse this. I want to stop this.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  By the way, Curt Nimmo wrote an article about Nelson Mandela. Obama and Nelson Mandela. George Washington, a communist. That's up on info wars.com.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  And then we've got some other very important articles that we're going to be getting to as well. Jordanian suspicious about US military deployment.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And it said they had a drill there and then now the US hasn't left. The drill started about a month ago but was supposed to end June 20th. The US military says they're staying because it's not the US military.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  It's the globalist military. Very, very spooky. Very, very weird.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  But getting back to this just briefly. Can Wi-Fi let you see through people's walls? Ladies and gentlemen, they keep having articles every week going. Researchers at a university were able to use the Kinect system or were able to use other Wi-Fi systems to see through walls and even face scan people.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Wow, they say it's incredible that the Wi-Fi can do it. They say, man, this is really high tech. This previously, what was on this Kinect and what was on these other systems was the most expensive Pentagon systems.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  It's incredible that this is so overly muscular on these systems. It is so powerful just for a little video game.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  This looks for your walls. It looks to your walls. It looks to your walls.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what they do. And they're showing the public very low power examples of how this is able to do it.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  And you can go to infowars.com and read all about that.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  But the point is, this is just more of a high tech version of ground penetrating radar. Speaking of that, RT reports FBI suit over secretive facial recognition program.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  Turns out they're scooping up digital photos from Facebook, driver's license databases. You name it.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  And I would also add, Facebook makes people confirm it's their Facebook by confirming, hey, this is your photo, right?
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  And hey, this is your high school buddy, blah, blah, blah. And now when you go on Facebook, it'll tell you when you upload a picture.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  They'll say, hey, these people with you are these people, right? Confirm for security.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  So the computer is now training you as a slave to respond to it and confirm as a human computer interface with human intelligence
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  that that is indeed the person. And then they have TV shows about how cool it is and new shows.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  And then in New York and LA and Tokyo and Moscow and London in the fanciest areas, they have deals where you walk by and the Facebook cameras shout out at you.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  Alex Jones, it's you. Wait, turn around just like in Minority Report that came out 10 years ago. They already had it then. They're getting you ready for it.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Hey, did you know you can get specials on this at a store just down the street? We know you like Polo.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Literally. That's what it was four years ago. This is the AI grid, but it's all done happy. If they painted army tanks pink, mothers would lay their babies down to have them run over by it.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care? Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  To learn more, visit infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to big pharma.

[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the 30th day of June 2013. Can you believe we're already more than halfway through 2013? Just light speed.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  I come in all the time to start the broadcast and almost announce 2008 or 2010. It's just the years just blip by. We got Wayne Madsen, NSA, insider, and whistleblower who had the U.S. government block stories he was interviewed in and the London Guardian and Observer.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  There's no coverage of this. This is a big story for whoever reports on it. Business Insider reported on it. We linked to it on infowars.com. But we have the rest of the story coming up in the next segment.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  But first, let me shift gears into an article we put out Friday that was linked up on the vaunted, almighty driver of news coverage, DrudgeReport.com, via infowars.com, ex-Chicago cop, Zimmerman acquittal to cause race riots.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Former cop and detective is an award-winning writer for major publications. You can read the whole story. He said that according to the thousands of tweets he's seeing, and what he's seen happen in the past with the Rodney King verdict and things like that, that if George Zimmerman is acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin,
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  the former Chicago police officer warns that the outcome of the case could spark race riots in cities all over America. And then we break down the entire situation in the article up on infowars.com that I think is in the top five most viral stories we've ever put out.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  On Friday, you can go to Google, but you can also go to other trackers. We had two stories in the top five. Our story about police strapping people down to forcibly take blood, and they like take big bags of blood now.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Just incredible. Didn't used to happen in America, happens now. Imagine in North Korea that was happening. We'd think it was horrible, but not here. We'll shoot some fireworks off.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  That was the fifth biggest story on the Web Friday, and the third biggest story was our George Zimmerman story about this. Just amazing to just routinely be able to do that.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  That's why infowars.com is so precious, is that we can get up here and get people to think for themselves, and even take mainstream news articles but point out another angle to it that really resonates with the people.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  Here's the article. You can read it up on infowars.com. It's in the most red section on the right hand column. Just scroll down about halfway, and there it is.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Chicago cops Zimmerman acquittal to cause race riots, and I saw video last week we talked about it of a nanny cam in New Jersey of this guy beating a woman, a black guy beating a white woman. It looked like for, I don't know, two or three minutes thrown her downstairs right in front of a three-year-old child.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  The woman didn't even resist him. It turns out that they have arrested a man who they think dead. He looks just like him. When they arrested him, he was wearing a black and white striped old-fashioned prison-style shirt.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  I guess he was already. He's been convicted of robbery four times and had just gotten out a month before from a short stint for an aggravated home invasion.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  Nanny Cam home invader who assaulted mother in front of her child was known to have entered a neighbor's home. Sean Curtis had recently been released from jail for burglary.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  If he was to break into my house, black or white, he'd be deader than a bucket of coffin nails. I can tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, because we don't call 911 except for them to come scoop up the body.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Come in my office, too. You're going to be going out feet first as well if you come in here with a weapon or trying to rob somebody.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  And you look at the crime rates in where they've taken almost all the guns in New Jersey, in areas of Illinois, like Chicago.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  I mean, the crime rate, I've shown the Justice Department numbers. It's 5, 10, 15, depending on the area, times higher than anywhere else in the U.S.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  And it's just so pathetic to see a big man beat up a woman. And I want to know this, if he isn't convicted, will there be race riots around America?
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  I don't think there should be. But the issue is that now there's all these witnesses that George Zimmerman walked up and asked the guy what he was doing.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Maybe that wasn't a good idea, but it didn't give Mr. Martin the right to break the guy's nose and bounce his head off the seamen over and over again.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  And that's what all the witnesses saw. And I'm sad that Trayvon Martin's dead, but the Justice Department went down there quietly behind the scenes.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  This came out to stir it up. They want racial division. Just look at MSNBC. It is abhorrent.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  They want to change the subject from deindustrialization and carbon taxes and corruption and all these megacorporations that put Obama in office being totally tax-exempt and more banker bailouts and the looting of the country on and on and on.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  They want to make it all about Obama being part African. I wouldn't care if he was blue, green, pink, purple if he was into liberty, but he is a heartable, corrupt globalist.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  And they are selling racial division in this country, and that's why there are black on white gangs attacking people all over the country.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  And you'll see newspapers apologize now when they report it, or they won't say when it's racially motivated unless it's white people.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  And this is done to, again, create racial division. Well, it's like Alec Baldwin. He's come out and used a bunch of homophobic words, calling gay people horrible names in tweets.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  I'm not going to repeat it. And, you know, he said, take Republicans out, go to their house, kill them, kill their children, burn down their houses, kill their families.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  He's above the law. So the London Guardian said Hollywood's refusal to stand up to Alec Baldwin is shameful.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  Alec Baldwin uses homophobic slurs against gay daily mail journalists, and nobody says anything, because political correctness is only meant to be used against libertarians or conservatives.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  It's only meant to stifle everybody's speech, but the establishment people. Okay, that's what's going on with Alec Baldwin.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  Alec Baldwin, you have been very useful to me to quote the great Kim Jong-il in Team America.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  All right, continuing here, let's get into George Zimmerman trial.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  Neighbor testified Trayvon Martin was straddling Zimmerman moments before fatal gunshot. Yeah, no kidding.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  And then other neighbors said they heard, please help me, get off me, help me.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  And it just goes on from there. Now we have this article, illiterate rambling defense witness Rachel Gentile is a victim of brain damaging mass fluoridation.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  And maybe Miss Teen USA is too. The only one we found dumbered in this lady. And let's go to some of the clips where, well, let's just go to this first clip where on the stand, the so-called star witness Rachel Gentile says creepy-ass cracker, not a racial slur.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  Describing the person is what made you think it was racial. Yes. And that's because he described him as a creepy-ass cracker. Yes.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  So it was racial, but it was because Trayvon Martin put race in this. No. You don't think that's a racial comment? No.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  All right, let's get her off there. Let's go to the next clip with this genius. Rachel Gentile can't read her own letter somebody wrote for. So let's, she can't read her own letter. Let's go to this clip.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  Miss Gentile, would you take a look at that copy of the letter and let me ask you a couple of questions about it. Do you recognize that letter as being one that you said earlier was prepared to be given to Miss Fulton? Yes.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And that letter was prepared with the assistance of a friend of yours named Francine Serv. Yes. And you and Miss Serv talked about what you wanted to be in the letter, and then she helped write it in a way that was legible, correct?
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  Yes. But the contents of the letter are yours. Yes. Are you able to read that copy well enough that you can tell us if it's in fact the same letter? No.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  That's enough. Are you unable to read that at all?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  When I come back, we're going to wait and imagine that first I'm going to play the victim of the TV dumb down culture, big government. Caitlyn Upton, not to be confused with the intelligent and lovely Kate Upton who I've seen do interviews.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  We're going to play a soul sister of this lady, the dumb blonde, Caitlyn Upton, with her famous teen USA speech. Now these women are up there promoting the NSA.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  Only 5% of hydrofluorosalic acid advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.

[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  We're going to go to sensor to NSA whistleblower Wayne Madsen. This is a big story of the balance of the hour in just a moment,
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  and I will give the number out so in the last segment you can have questions for him about the NSA.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  Now, again, I've been having him on and been saying, folks, I wouldn't be surprised that they try to shut this down
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  because he knows a lot more than even people like Snowden, and he's not been even giving out secrets.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  He's too smart for that. He's been giving out what's been already leaked and pointing out what he can legally point out.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  That's why they've had a major interview he did for the London Guardian Slash Observer, the biggest paper in England,
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  the biggest English-speaking paper in Europe, shut down.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Not for inaccuracy, it's disappeared, and it's starting to break here in the U.S.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  You're getting an exclusive with Wayne Madsen.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  But first, showing the dumbing down, I just played clips of the Rachel John Tell, you know, not even really knowing what planet she's on.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  And so many people are like this, and here's Caitlin Upton, the Miss Teen USA pageant a few years ago that's so famous,
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  not knowing what planet she's on. So no wonder the tyrants are going crazy because of things like this. Here it is.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map. Why do you think this is?
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have bounce,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  and I believe that our education, like such as South Africa and Iraq, everywhere like such as, and I believe that they should,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or should help South Africa and should help Iraq and the Asian countries.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  So we will be able to build up our future.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  Thank you.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  Now, Mary McCord just a few weeks ago at the Miss USA pageant, she's Miss Alabama, she had this to say about the NSA,
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  so they are definitely training them well. Here it is.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  For two, Wendy Malick, your question please for Alabama. Government tracking and phone records has been in the news lately. Is this an invasion of privacy or necessary to keep our country safe? Why or why not?
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  I think the society that we live in today, it's sad that if we go to the movies or to the airport or even to the mall that we have to worry about our safety. So I would rather someone track my telephone messages and feel safe wherever I go.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  Feel safer.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  And feel like they're encroaching on my privacy.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  Thank you.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  I think I'm also going to date the Hell's Angels.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  This is why our country isn't so much trouble. And the idea that a government that can listen to your phone calls isn't going to do something bad with that.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  You're always going to get criminal elements. And when you let them do unconstitutional things, bad things happen.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  That's why we've always known the bad countries listen to your phone calls. The bad countries like Guatemala and North Korea reads your mail.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  The bad countries have police wearing black ski masks. Mexico had that 60 years ago.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  Areas of Eastern Europe had that 50 years ago. 60 years ago. They're called secret police.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  But everything bad countries do, we now have, and as long as we chant USA. USA. USA. USA over the top of it.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  USA. USA!
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:25.160]  USA ship our jobs to China pay 21 billion dollars to ship General Motors of China with taxpayer money. Yeah
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:32.760]  I'm telling you folks if you had army tanks that were pink and said it was for Obama liberals would bring their kids out and run tanks over them
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:39.400]  I'm telling you could have cyanide pills and mark them with like little puppy dogs on the tablets and say it's trendy and they'd eat them
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.400]  I'm not joking. I
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:47.360]  Just want to be listen to I'm safe. I'm safer USA America
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.680]  It is so pathetic ladies and gentlemen ever the balance of the hour he joins us graciously
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.320]  He's gonna be back home with Mike Adams is filling in tomorrow, but then I'm back Tuesday
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.280]  Promise my children. I'm taking them fishing and
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.680]  taking them
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.720]  Wakeboarding so it's going to happen didn't happen a few weeks ago. It's happening tomorrow. I'm taking off tomorrow
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.400]  The great Mike Adams is gonna be here and he'll be back with Wayne tomorrow in a more in-depth discussion
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.480]  Hopefully this will be in the press by then, but I noticed on an article at info works calm today
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:26.040]  But you can see right now. We can put it on screen and show TV viewers radio listeners just go there
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.040]  We're about to go to break when I just want to introduce this
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.960]  That there was a a London Guardian observer. That's the twin papers big article about
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:40.280]  The EU working with the US to spy illegally well that came out in the EU Commission a decade ago
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:46.400]  That came out in James Bamford's book 12 years ago. You know the guy that ran Nightline had a best-selling book ABC news was behind it
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.920]  so
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.440]  Wayne Madsen talked about that he worked at the NSA. He's testified before Congress on this and other matters
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:00.920]  He's written versus the biggest publications in the US. We've been having him on nobody else has so the Guardian who's been really on this
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.880]  interviews him
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.000]  Notices that we're already in the press last week that they've been sent out to shut down stuff in the Guardian
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.960]  We now learn it's Wayne Madsen now
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.960]  Do you think that should be news that a US former NSA guy?
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.680]  journalist award-winning
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.800]  Got shut down
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.560]  Do you think that should be news? No, it's not news it disappeared and the Google cash
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:27.200]  I saw the Google cash this morning reddit had our guys post the Google cash on our site
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:33.700]  So the articles they're still saved. Well, they shut down info wars.com. I've never seen the Google cash shut down like this
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.440]  They don't want to and again. They didn't retract something. They just removed it
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.640]  But then started dis info campaigns on the web against Wayne Madsen
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:49.400]  They are scared why because he's doing it right. He is blowing the whistle on what's hidden in plain view
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.040]  He has credibility so now they want to assassinate his character will get more into that
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:58.040]  But Wayne bottom line you talked to the Guardian slasher observer. They admitted they were leaned on
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.280]  well, I talked to the
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.880]  Observer and they had
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:11.320]  Bed at this through their legal counsel. I assume all their editors signed off on it
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.040]  They got everybody's chop and right as the
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:23.560]  The the the observer actually the print edition the first edition already ran and was sent out to the news agents
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.680]  The second edition the story disappeared from the front page of the paper edition and of course
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.880]  First if you went to the Guardian site, it said
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:36.800]  The site the link is down because of an investigation
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.200]  Whatever that means and then that now the now it says the site is the link is broken. So
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.960]  For all purposes the story
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.520]  Was removed and then they disappeared it off the Google wayback machine unprecedented
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.840]  Yeah, I mean I went when I put the word out to some of my friends and colleagues
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.200]  I said something's going on a lot of them grabbed it and and saved it because
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.240]  This is
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:09.760]  Rather unusual even for some seasoned journalists that I spoke to now for those that don't know we're gonna come back
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:15.520]  Give you the floor as best I can this is such a big deal. It's hard to not add points the big enchilada here from my perspective
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.520]  We'll get your take on this when we come back
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.240]  Is that you don't want to go to prison because you were you know a pretty high-level guy at the NSA?
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:28.480]  You work up on Capitol Hill anybody can watch C-span and see a national security hearings
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.560]  You'll see you there reporting at the National Press Club. You're a smart guy
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.160]  You're going off what's already been admitted before in EU commissions
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:43.720]  Which I noticed articles saying the EU's mad at the US over spying. They're of course running it all basically
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:49.400]  That's what you expose. That's why they're upset. So this is this is admitted already
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:57.160]  Declassified info being censored now and a journalist being censored. This is a big deal folks for freedom of the press
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.880]  We'll be back with Wayne Madsen of Wayne Madsen report.com

[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.280]  Sergeant Biggs
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:23.360]  We're gonna get to all that but Wayne you heard what I said before the break for me. This is a huge deal
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:24.960]  that
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:31.120]  That you are a member of the press you've written for the biggest newspapers and magazines in the country people can go look up
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:37.720]  Your bio you've testified to Congress main committees many times. You were in the NSA in the Naval War College before that
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.880]  You were in NSA security. That's how you know about the Q group
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:46.600]  What do you think it is that got this censored because I guess you have broken the Q group
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.280]  I you called it a kind of a in internal praetorian SS to persecute whistleblowers
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:58.920]  I mean, is that something because the rest of the stuff you brought out and I want you to go over the EU Commission news
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:05.720]  Bamford's book. I mean this stuff has been out. I know that's where my sources are. That's how I knew all this guess like you
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:10.480]  I mean, you're going about this smart from other people. I've talked to their former government
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:17.960]  You're talking about what is already out there, but not really known. Is that why they did this de-notice? Unprecedented to shut down
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.440]  what you were saying I
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:26.520]  Think that may be part of it. Also. I think they just can't handle all the leaks. There's another set of
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:35.640]  Leaks in the Guardian today from Snowden about how they were bugging embassies and this if he had access to that this kind of proves
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:40.480]  The point I was making earlier. I believe Snowden was probably
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.440]  Working for the special collection service, which is a hybrid CIA FBI
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:51.800]  Operation it does exactly that they put bugs and embassies in Washington elsewhere, New York
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:56.400]  Overseas and and now he's released a bunch of that type of information
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.440]  but
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:07.040]  Basically what I experienced yesterday when this story came out is a little bit like what Glenn Greenwald has been facing
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.320]  all of a sudden there was this sort of a
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.160]  attack pack on the internet people
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.040]  contacting all these websites flooding the Twitter with all these
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.520]  tweets
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:27.720]  Talking about previous stories I had written and if that was the intention to shoot the messenger
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:33.440]  I think it backfired on him a lot of there were a lot of references to the stories I did in Chicago about
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.880]  Obama's sexual orientation and
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.280]  Where is he right now? He's in South Africa
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:47.400]  He's had a very tough time of it on his African trip trying to convince certain African countries to
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:54.160]  Provide more in the way of rights for gays when in fact Africa is going the opposite direction
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.400]  It's not a popular cause in Africa. So he's got egg all over his
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.960]  Well, I gotta say this when they rolled out two little kids at the gay lesbian event
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.160]  I don't even get into this issue and I know you're not you know anti-gay or anything
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:12.440]  But I mean they rolled out little kids at the gay lesbian event to introduce it and they're talking about kids cartoons
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:19.760]  I mean if heterosexuals were involving kids on TV and cartoons sexualization it'd be called really creepy
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.760]  You know if Calvin Klein has teenagers half naked. It's called creepy. What's this thing with kids?
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:30.840]  And I got to say at that gay lesbian event. He was prancing around on the stage and you know, whatever the point is
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:36.600]  That's blackmail material. That's why we're concerned about it. Not about his sexual preference. Tell people your intel on that
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.200]  You did this investigation
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.080]  into Obama and Larry Sinclair and stuff
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:49.720]  Yeah, I mean, I did not believe Larry Sinclair at first and I wrote that and he told me he said I was pretty tough
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.320]  on him and
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:58.880]  But when I went to Chicago, I started hearing the same story. So I looked into it a lot further. I hear here's the thing that you know
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:06.520]  Is amazing when Michael Issacoff got the story on Monica Lewinsky in the blue dress and all that business
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.840]  You know that was mainstream media all over that story when it's Obama
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.160]  No, it's relegated to the you know off-beat sites the the non mainstream media sites
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.320]  but what has happened here by
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:24.840]  By these attack dogs coming after me because of other stories
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.400]  I had written which have nothing to do with the NSA story by the way now the
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.160]  bit about Obama's history
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:39.280]  In Chicago and and and people saying he's gay is in some of the biggest newspapers in Europe
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.960]  That would have not happened had they not taken the avenue gone down the avenue
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:49.920]  They did because and they had these NSA defense people, you know war college people and stuff have come out against you
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.280]  They're really concerned about this. Oh
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:39:00.600]  Yeah, I mean one of the one of the central figures is a professor at the Naval War College where I had done some post graduate work in a
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:06.440]  Continuing education course. I've got the certificate and I think it's kind of unusual that you know
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.440]  You'd have so many on a US government payroll
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:14.520]  Using his affiliation with the war college attacking me like he's on duty
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:20.840]  It was almost like this guy's on duty because it went all afternoon all evening all into the wee hours of the morning
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:29.040]  Look, we know we know from Cass on steam and what the NSA is doing through cyber command that they have these sock puppets out
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.320]  There to you know destroy the message money the waters
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.160]  Oh, no, they admit cyber command is hired hundreds of private companies
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:40.020]  Yeah, our companies to attack people that came out on the National Guard in Katrina
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:44.240]  Yeah, putting whole teams for two years on one woman from the state who criticized
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:49.040]  You know the work they done. I mean we know what's going on, but expanding on this
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.040]  I mean when you're always not making a big deal about yourself
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:58.360]  You broke some major news that was hiding in plain view about the EU and what info pole 9 and then the
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:04.500]  The GS whatever it is was a GS 5 there with the British spy network
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.560]  Breakdown this because they're in the news going how dare America's spying on us when they're all involved in the same system
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.920]  So so break down what was in the piece that they're so scared of
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:22.080]  Well, what was in the piece was basically we know that Ed Snowden has talked about third-party
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:28.320]  Relationships of NSA and also a second party. There's a recent revelation in Spiegel
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:34.840]  There's Spiegel yesterday where he's talking about third parties. He cites Germany as being one of the countries
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.080]  This was being lost because this was being looked into
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.920]  By the European Union and other governments in 1999 2000 report was issued
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:51.720]  9-11 comes along and all of this is forgotten, you know, it just goes down the memory hole
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.480]  I I actually testified before the EU
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.720]  Parliamentary Commission they came to Washington DC and I told them, you know
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.960]  What I knew about the echelon and the system by which they
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:11.820]  Shared information and that wound up in a report, but here's what came out of the Snowden revelations that
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:17.680]  GCHQ which is Britain's NSA equivalent and partner
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.680]  They and NSA were jointly tapping the transatlantic
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:29.120]  Cable in Cornwall and it comes from a Denmark down to Germany
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:34.520]  The Netherlands Belgium and France and then it pops over the English Channel goes over to Cornwall
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:40.520]  And it heads over to Tuckerton, New Jersey. They were sucking everything off this cable email phone calls
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:45.080]  You name it the metadata stuff a system called at Cornwall
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.080]  tempura and
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:50.240]  What and then the Germans
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:57.560]  Angola Merkel and the French started to get on their high horse what here's Britain once again acting as
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:03.280]  America's Trojan horse when in fact I pointed out that Germany as a third-party
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  country to the NSA or
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:09.600]  Second relationship only the English-speaking countries are second parties
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:16.240]  So so the third parties are NATO allies that don't speak English Germany Denmark the Netherlands Italy Spain
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:21.760]  And Japan and South Korea in Asia. I pointed out that for years
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.720]  The Germans and the Spanish jointly tapped the trans Mediterranean trans
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:35.840]  Atlantic cable in southern Spain and Coneo did la frontera and and then they pull it all together different
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:43.740]  Yeah, so they all tap different things and then pull it all that came out when you testify before the EU that came out in
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:50.360]  Bamford's book. He was the main news guy at Nightline. This is a fact. You put it back out there in your article disappears

[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:09.180]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network Network
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:17.620]  For 50 years we've told what to eat what to drink what to wear
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:26.780]  But Christ's sake Ben, don't you understand Americans love television. They wean their kids on it. This is they love game shows
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:30.180]  They love wrestling. They love sports and violence
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:32.860]  So what do we do?

[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:44.100]  But at the expense of all basic freedom Wayne Madsen, I want to jam in a few calls
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:49.180]  You're back tomorrow on the show in the middle of the broadcast to get into the latest developments on this because we know
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:51.140]  There'll be more tomorrow and get in any other points
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:54.340]  We didn't have time to cover tonight the weekday show 11 to 2 central
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:48:01.220]  Find station listings free podcast audio video streams at info wars comm and prison punna comm for new listeners
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:06.660]  Out there. We're not just your Sundays four to six. So bottom line what you're saying is hey
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:12.140]  The Europe and others act all holier than now. They're all putting in the same systems. They're all pooling it
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.940]  They're all sharing it. In fact, I've read but I've had Bamford on
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:20.220]  From ABC news that he broke that they'll spy. Of course, you were there
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:27.020]  They'll spy they'll have the Brit spy on the Americans and the American spy on the Brits vice versa because it's so illegal
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:32.620]  It creates more plausible deniability in that way. You're not listening to your own cousin. Is that accurate?
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:36.020]  Yeah, not only the Brits do it for the Americans and vice versa
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:42.260]  But the Canadians do it for the Americans and the Brits and vice versa the Australians put for the Americans and the Brits
[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:47.340]  So foreigners are listening to our phones not just our criminal government. So there's the big bombshell
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:50.900]  What in total what do you make of this whole NS thing?
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:53.940]  NSA thing and where it's going
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:49:00.660]  Well, we don't we don't know how much more Snowden has apparently he's turned over the bulk of his
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:07.180]  Documents and most of them look like they're briefing slides and and point papers wait papers
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:11.660]  He's turned this over at least to the Guardian. I don't know how much he's given to the Washington post
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:17.620]  But certainly they're not as open and releasing this stuff as the Guardian has been
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:21.620]  He was high level then this is like owner's manual stuff
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:25.620]  Yeah, he was kind of it's like a system administrator security administrator
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:27.620]  so he had access to a lot of stuff and
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:34.740]  You know the Guardian of course is stringing it out and making a release sort of like what WikiLeaks did
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.300]  With their with their State Department cables
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:45.780]  But now we've got the story about the bugging of the embassies the missions in Washington, New York and in Europe and
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.740]  It's interesting
[01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:54.540]  the Italians the EU itself their missions in New York and Washington were bugged the Italians the French and the
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:50:04.420]  Greeks but big Germans and the Dutch and the Danes who were also the third party allies of NSA were not so
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:06.920]  I think we're looking at basically
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:15.100]  the northern European countries that are not having austerity problems like they are in southern Europe are the ones doing the spying or
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.940]  Getting spot on or not
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:23.700]  This is big news because it shows for all these countries. It's their own scandals
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:28.660]  What do you make? I want to play this clip and get your take on it for meet the press last week with
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:32.620]  David Gregory sounding like some type of authoritarian
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:38.300]  Muppet from a dystopic nightmare here it is to the extent that you have aided and abetted
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:45.060]  Snowden even in his current movements. Why shouldn't you mr. Greenwald be charged with a crime?
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:47.940]  You're aiding and abetting the New World Order Gregory. I
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:54.780]  Think it's pretty extraordinary that anybody who would call themselves a journalist would publicly
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:51:01.100]  Muse about whether or not other journalists should be charged with felonies the assumption in your question David is
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:04.660]  Completely without evidence the idea that I've aided and abetted him in any way
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:11.580]  The scandal that arose in Washington before our stories began was about the fact that the Obama administration is trying to criminalize
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:19.060]  Investigative journalism by going through the the emails and phone records of AP reporters accusing a Fox News journalist of the theory
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:24.140]  That you just embraced being a co-conspirator with felony in felonies for working with sources
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:28.140]  If you want to embrace that theory, it means that every investigative journalist in the United States
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:34.460]  That's good. We played that before Wayne briefly. What do you make of this beating the drums to arrest American journalist?
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:38.180]  Yeah, this same David Gregory who was dancing at a White House
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:45.980]  A dinner once with Carl Rove who who outed Valerie Plain Wilson who was a covert CIA agent?
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:47.980]  So he's talking about aiding and abetting
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:54.340]  Somebody David Gregory danced with somebody who was involved in and in leaking classes
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:52:00.540]  He's aiding and abetting. I mean the whole point is everybody knows their spying Snowden did what I think is very patriotic for liberty
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:05.300]  Worldwide he didn't give out the codes to the ICBMs. He didn't ship our jobs to China
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:08.980]  He didn't sell us out to foreign banks. That's the aiding and abetting briefly
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:11.900]  I want to go to calls here Wayne of Wayne Madsen report calm
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:16.300]  We haven't linked up in your reports with all this breaking news with the documents with the spike story
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:19.740]  The screenshots while they're still there of the story
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:26.540]  They spiked at the Guardian an observer at info wars.com with links to Wayne Madsen report calm Wayne bottom line
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:31.940]  I've had the I've talked to the people that have talked to the family his best buddy. He says yeah, they think he was killed
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:38.380]  They want an investigation that should be news. What do you think or have you heard from your sources on the Hill that the
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:42.560]  Associate editor at the New York Times Michael Hastings was reporting on
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:49.420]  Look, I haven't always agreed with Richard Clark the former counterterrorism star for the Clinton and Bush administration
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:52.420]  But he came out and stated that it's possible to
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:59.020]  Put a hack into the computer in that very easy that Hastings was driving now look
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:03.020]  I'm going to be accused of doing another conspiracy theory. That's the charge
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:07.300]  That all these sites but are making and all these people on the internet
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:15.180]  But let me say that I I was in London in Paris right after Princess Diana's death in the car crash in the tunnel in Paris
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:16.260]  Oh, they were more controlled it
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:22.420]  I heard the same thing then and how many years ago was that so how old is the technology part knows how old it is
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:26.460]  And certainly that's that's what happened with Princess Diana
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:31.340]  Yeah, yeah, they could put a special box on cars that are 50 years old
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:38.660]  But cars the last 15 years or so have the plug right into totally control them. That's DARPA zone briefings since about the mid-1990s
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.900]  So longer than 15 years
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:46.300]  But I mean his family is out saying they think that he was killed and then no media will touch that
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:53.260]  Yeah, I don't what I know is the stories. He was working on he was working on a story about the former
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:56.700]  CIA chief and now jeers who was put in jail
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:54:00.660]  He's serving time in Ashland, Kentucky in a federal penitentiary there now
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:04.820]  It looks like he spoke like five or six Arabic dialects
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:09.760]  They got him on some sort of sexual harassment charge one thing led to another now. He's serving time
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:12.980]  He was a convert to Islam
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:19.500]  An African-American which is very rare to find with the CIA station chief and yet he's serving time
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:25.420]  So I don't see President Obama our first average an American president doing anything to help this guy
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:29.380]  I know he's just making sure they increase forced abortion funding in Africa. Yeah, Joseph
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:33.180]  Sorry, go ahead. I was just gonna say Hastings interviewed him
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:36.340]  in his jail cell
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:41.900]  In in in Kentucky. He was also working on the Jill Kelly story
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:45.580]  The woman of course who was involved with the email
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:50.540]  Sorted absolutely. Let's just jam in a few final calls. He can cover this more tomorrow
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:55.260]  Joseph real fast question from Missouri for Wayne Madsen. Go ahead sir. Thanks for calling
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:55:01.660]  Yeah, mr. Madsen mr. Jones. I'm you know, um, we know through history about
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:05.940]  American and England playing the role with Hitler and put in such force
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:10.260]  The idea came to me. I'm a religious. I'm not a religious
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:16.900]  Sure, that's the question bro. We're almost out of time. Hmm. Okay. What if all this was a setup not mr. Snowden involved
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:20.820]  But religiously some believe brush and China will come against America
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:27.140]  What if this was all just you could say? Well, you know, our government shipped all our industry to China on purpose
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:33.860]  So that is part of the globalist plan. I'm Wayne Madsen. Yeah, I don't think China and or Russia really
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:39.320]  Wanted to see Snowden wind up in one case in Hong Kong, which is a special
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.980]  Yeah, they Russia's told him get out Russia said leave. They already know all this
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:46.420]  Right, and you know, I mean they don't want to turn them over
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:52.700]  But you know, the US is like a little spoiled brat the way we threaten countries with all kinds of
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:59.140]  Absolutely, let's take another one here. Let's talk to Patrick in Oregon real quick question Patrick. Sorry. I waited to the end go ahead
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:04.500]  It's okay. Hi guys. Hey, my question is what do you think Snowden is a real guy?
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:10.260]  I mean, do you think they just fabricated him out of thin air just so they can use this as a I think he's real
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:15.660]  But but they're gonna try to spin it the way they want. I think he's real Wayne. Yeah, he's real
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:20.060]  I I talked to a lot of people that know exactly where he's worked
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:26.580]  And you know, I know there was this idea that you know as he's serving some other agenda
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:32.020]  He just shocked a lot of people when he you know walked away and it wound up in Hong Kong
[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:36.180]  We're not used to that happened in NSA before back in the 60s
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:42.660]  There were two mathematicians working on crypto codes that actually wound up at a news conference in Moscow
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:49.500]  They were they were spies. They they said they'd rather live in the Soviet Union. They were Marxist working on crypto codes
[01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.960]  Can you believe it and then I say Martin and Mitchell?
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:59.420]  So but that was a little different than this guy. They this guy's a libertarian patriot. Yeah, yeah those the Martin and Mitchell were
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:04.740]  Communists who didn't like working in NSA already disagree with that point. Do you have a point dad?
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:07.300]  No, I agree
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:12.020]  But what's the Russians gonna do is shooting gonna take his laptop and look through it or what's going on?
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:15.820]  Yeah, he'll probably take his shirt off around around a horse. Listen, we're out of time here
