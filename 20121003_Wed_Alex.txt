[00:42.920 --> 00:47.400]  be here for the next three hours live and we have some guests that end up coming on
[00:47.400 --> 00:51.560]  frequently because they're so informative and also I like talking to them and they're
[00:51.560 --> 00:57.160]  popular with the audience that is the trifecta the perfect storm Gerald Salente will be on
[00:57.160 --> 01:02.600]  with us to take calls I'll try not to hog him for the full hour and maybe take 40 minutes
[01:02.600 --> 01:09.400]  of calls or so we'll do as best we can doing that today with Gerald Salente coming up in
[01:09.400 --> 01:14.600]  the third hour Pat Shannon hadn't been on in years but I've been talking to Pat and
[01:14.600 --> 01:20.520]  known him for about 17 years author great journalist he'll be joining us talking about
[01:20.520 --> 01:26.120]  his new book everything they told me was a lie he'll be joining us in the second hour
[01:26.120 --> 01:34.200]  we'll also take some calls for Pat Shannon as well on election 2012 okay wow where to start here
[01:34.200 --> 01:39.560]  where to start here there is just so much and every day when I end the show I get really mad
[01:39.560 --> 01:47.880]  at myself because I end up not covering all of the news that I had intended to get to show
[01:47.880 --> 01:56.840]  I am going to try my very very darned is today to get through all of this you know there's
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.480]  a big controversy a talking point that Obama isn't good on national security when he's a
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.440]  total globalist I mean it's the opposite of national security I want to get rid of nationalism
[02:06.440 --> 02:12.520]  in end of any sovereignty in the end of any type of freedom but the neocons have been beaten
[02:12.520 --> 02:19.000]  drum for several weeks saying that you know they lied about it being al-qaeda that killed the
[02:19.000 --> 02:26.200]  ambassador while ignoring the issue that nato and the republican leadership in the congress
[02:26.200 --> 02:34.760]  were instrumental in backing putting al-qaeda in Libya in Syria and other areas there were five
[02:34.760 --> 02:42.520]  car bombs by al-qaeda in Syria in and around Damascus I mean this is a major war this is a
[02:43.080 --> 02:50.760]  this is a major proxy war that is going on right now in fact the associated press as the headline
[02:50.760 --> 02:59.880]  that there are covert wars going on in Africa all over Africa and the Middle East well no
[02:59.880 --> 03:06.040]  kidding I mean this is a war people are like Alex where's the war you said there'll be a war
[03:06.040 --> 03:13.160]  what do you call all this well it's a globalist takeover and then the public's so dumbed down
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.320]  about the players they're like well we got to be in the Middle East al-qaeda al-qaeda works for the
[03:17.320 --> 03:23.480]  globalist it's funded it's protected by them so White House has no comment on House Geo peers
[03:23.480 --> 03:31.560]  assertions that Libyan mission requests security part of 9 11 this year which of course they did
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.920]  request the security they were set up the question is by who you know we've heard a lot of stuff from
[03:36.920 --> 03:42.200]  Webster Tarpley and Steve Pachennick and I don't know if they're right because in a in a world
[03:42.200 --> 03:48.600]  of disinformation and lies I'm not saying they're lying but you can't nail down exactly who's behind
[03:48.600 --> 03:55.000]  this I've tried in hindsight it usually comes out but but we're so close to the events all I know
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.800]  is there's the overarching issue here of al-qaeda being injected all over Africa they're even in
[04:03.800 --> 04:08.840]  Central Africa now not just North Africa and East Africa and they're injecting them all over the
[04:08.840 --> 04:14.680]  Middle East and Central Asia and I saw another headline last night in fact I think I am but to
[04:14.680 --> 04:24.040]  you guys with the headline that that that Iran is working with al-qaeda and that a nuclear Iran is
[04:24.040 --> 04:32.040]  a nuclear al-qaeda well that was Netanyahu saying that again folks al-qaeda is the opposite of Iran
[04:32.040 --> 04:37.960]  and the Shiites I mean you can label the Shiite government over there as terrorist if you want
[04:37.960 --> 04:42.280]  but it's a different group than al-qaeda and I just cannot stand this anymore yeah there it is
[04:42.280 --> 04:47.480]  State Department Iran supports al-qaeda Taliban print that for me too I mean there's just no
[04:47.480 --> 04:52.440]  in no Hillary Clinton you support them so I don't have a dog in this fight with the Republicans
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.120]  and Democrats fighting over you know what's happening in the Middle East the point is that
[04:56.840 --> 04:57.960]  we'll break it down we come back
[04:59.880 --> 05:05.000]  Aaron Fullen here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.400]  are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy homecrafted
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.640]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[05:13.640 --> 05:18.120]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[05:18.120 --> 05:22.040]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[05:22.040 --> 05:26.120]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in
[05:26.120 --> 05:31.480]  almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat
[05:31.480 --> 05:36.200]  kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news

[08:59.880 --> 09:06.520]  planet dot com and info wars dot com info wars dot com because there is a war on for your mind
[09:06.520 --> 09:11.320]  prison planet dot com because the globalists in their own words want to construct and build
[09:11.320 --> 09:17.880]  a prison planet where from cradle to grave you are under eugenicist population reduction control
[09:18.520 --> 09:22.440]  the humans that will be allowed to continue on in the future will be dumbed down
[09:22.440 --> 09:29.960]  suboid toys of the globalist so they can feel superior and remember their victory over humanity
[09:29.960 --> 09:35.400]  and that of course is paraphrasing many of their own words that we document in my film end game
[09:35.400 --> 09:41.240]  blueprint for global enslavement okay jerald calente is joining us to take your phone calls on the
[09:41.240 --> 09:47.320]  accelerating global engineered collapse in the third hour always popular on the show and informative
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.400]  and we have pat shannon everything they ever told me was a lie author very informative investigative
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.560]  journalists who i've known for 17 years hadn't been on a few years he's going to be on with us in
[09:57.560 --> 10:06.840]  the second hour today okay uh look i've just got so many stacks of news here uh let me just uh
[10:09.080 --> 10:14.520]  start on the right and go to the left not even necessarily uh the the top stories here
[10:15.320 --> 10:23.080]  that we're going to be uh going over and by that there's just so much i'm not going to even the
[10:23.080 --> 10:27.720]  the most important stories first because quite frankly i can't even decide what is most important
[10:27.720 --> 10:35.640]  anymore i'm normally very decisive it's just that now the rampant insane tyranny is so wall to wall
[10:37.240 --> 10:42.200]  that i just have my head spinning and i guess that's exactly where the globalists want us
[10:42.920 --> 10:47.800]  but it is all insane uh one area i do want to get into a little bit later in the hour
[10:47.800 --> 10:57.240]  is the fact that whole foods uh is going around the internet removing videos uh showing that they
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.600]  are more and more selling genetically modified food we're talking cross species chimera stuff
[11:03.320 --> 11:09.640]  we're talking about uh crops that grow their own pesticides inside them that kill bugs that eat it
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.200]  and people are like well at least whole foods tries to be organic
[11:14.200 --> 11:21.400]  and the uh issue there is if the globalists can take over
[11:23.880 --> 11:31.560]  whole foods they can take anything over and so it's kind of like you know uh you you come home
[11:31.560 --> 11:38.120]  and you find your wife in bed with another man you know there's hookers downtown on the side of
[11:38.120 --> 11:43.640]  the street you're not mad at them uh you don't have a personal beef with them it's like hey other
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.600]  grocery stores are pure poison other restaurants are pure gmo why are you mad at whole foods well
[11:48.600 --> 11:54.200]  because people spent money there people have supported it uh it's claimed it's all about
[11:54.200 --> 12:00.040]  organic it's helped lead the way being founded here in austin texas and has become a multi
[12:00.040 --> 12:05.080]  billion dollar a year profitable company and now it's meeting with monsanto heads now it's giving
[12:05.080 --> 12:13.400]  money uh to the uh monsanto's former lawyer uh who is the director of the fda i mean all of this is
[12:13.400 --> 12:19.880]  in the report erin dykes put out yesterday at info wars dot com monsanto shutting down videos
[12:19.880 --> 12:25.800]  exposing that they sell gmo all the documents the sec filings all of it so the issue is
[12:26.920 --> 12:31.000]  the founding fathers didn't really get mad at british officers they were just the enemy
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.320]  but everybody got mad at benedict arnold because he'd been a successful patriotic general in the
[12:37.320 --> 12:43.640]  rebellion uh in the new republic uh and then it turned out at the end he flipped sides and was a
[12:43.640 --> 12:49.480]  double crosser and so he's known as a benedict arnold that's why people are so hurt that's why
[12:49.480 --> 12:56.920]  people are so angry i saw some moron comment on info wars dot com this morning in an article that uh
[12:56.920 --> 13:05.240]  mike adams uh wrote for natural news that we uh posted and uh he says youtube censors organic spies
[13:05.240 --> 13:11.640]  video exposing whole foods employees lying about gmo and we'll put that on screen for tv viewers

[18:26.360 --> 18:31.480]  whatever reason stuff written in the afternoon because stuff gets posted about six a.m eight a.m

[18:44.600 --> 18:52.840]  mainstream ideologies that's a quote as terrorists and we've got the us army's own manuals uh because
[18:52.840 --> 18:57.240]  the army now is over domestic operations when they were arresting peaceful protesters uh
[18:57.240 --> 19:04.200]  a month ago at the dnc was in the news the army was would would order police arrest them playing
[19:04.200 --> 19:09.880]  closed army and then the army went to the judges and said uh keep these protesters in jail for a
[19:09.880 --> 19:14.840]  few weeks uh we don't want them out because protesting is low-level terror and they presented
[19:14.840 --> 19:21.560]  to the judge the homeland security guidelines saying protesting is quote low-level terrorism and cops
[19:21.560 --> 19:25.400]  out there who are in intelligence you know the so-called intelligence bureaus they're all not
[19:25.400 --> 19:29.320]  in their head yeah you're like yeah no they that's that's what our manuals say uh and it's saying
[19:29.320 --> 19:34.280]  just not believing mainstream media you're a terrorist okay and don't forget the same government

[19:49.480 --> 19:54.120]  have our heads screwed on straight uh and of course that ties into the associated press admitting

[24:20.200 --> 24:26.200]  seasons don't fear the reaper
[24:34.200 --> 24:40.440]  the globalist they want to overtake creation they want to rewrite it in their ugly image
[24:40.440 --> 24:47.880]  so they can announce that they are god of this planet god of this world and that's the manifestation
[24:47.880 --> 24:53.960]  we're seeing right now you know the time for screwing around the time for playing games is over
[24:53.960 --> 25:02.600]  because the hour is getting late my friends look around you at all of the insanity taking place
[25:02.600 --> 25:08.040]  in the massive arms built up by governments and corporations against the people because criminal
[25:08.040 --> 25:14.760]  elements have seized the institutions there are a lot of good people within the institutions but
[25:14.760 --> 25:21.960]  they are being slowly twisted to the dark side evil is approaching critical mass flashpoint
[25:21.960 --> 25:32.280]  explosion point jump point implosion point that's how tyranny's work they they rot slowly and
[25:32.280 --> 25:38.840]  then suddenly there's a collapse event an orgy event of evil and we're now just beginning the
[25:38.840 --> 25:45.720]  descent i've got crime news without even looking for crime news of riots here riots there people
[25:45.720 --> 25:53.080]  occupying buildings occupying stores mass shootings hijackings all over the country of 18 wheelers
[25:53.080 --> 26:00.360]  of trains cops getting shot all over the place citizens being killed crime is exploding right
[26:00.360 --> 26:08.840]  now major heist museums being robbed every day without even looking museums are being robbed
[26:08.840 --> 26:14.520]  but it's in this article it's in that article they never say hey crime's exploding and then of
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.320]  course it's it's famously known that big cities cook their crime numbers down so they can claim
[26:19.320 --> 26:23.720]  they're doing a good job meanwhile police more and more admit they've even had the new york police
[26:23.720 --> 26:27.720]  union multiple times come out in the last few years and say look we don't want to give
[26:27.720 --> 26:32.040]  of someone sitting on a park bench more than five minutes a ticket they have those rules
[26:32.040 --> 26:36.680]  in new york we don't want to give a pregnant woman sitting down on the side of the street waiting
[26:36.680 --> 26:42.760]  for a bus a ticket because there's no seats on the bus stop we don't want to give somebody
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.480]  throwing the wrong thing and the wrong trash can you know a $500 ticket we've been ordered to
[26:48.040 --> 26:53.800]  even that corrupt union doesn't like doing what they're doing even the most corrupt police
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.360]  force in the country at least the most arrogant from what i've seen and out of control they don't
[26:58.360 --> 27:04.600]  like this but they're ordered to and that leads me to this article that i'm having reposted because
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.640]  it came out yesterday evening at the top of info wars.com it's a big deal you've seen the army
[27:09.640 --> 27:13.720]  documents and the homeland security documents saying returning veterans the number one threat
[27:13.720 --> 27:19.560]  gun owners conservatives libertarians we broke that news the last four years with law enforcement
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.920]  sending it to us that are freaked out and should be by this information who aren't completely brainwashed
[27:24.920 --> 27:29.160]  when they go to meetings and the founding fathers are badmouthed and gun owners are badmouthed and
[27:29.160 --> 27:34.200]  veterans are badmouthed that's the bad guys that talk like that and this is pretty obvious
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.200]  sounds like something you hear in a soviet reeducation camp
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.240]  US army characterizes people frustrated with mainstream ideologies as terrorist
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.800]  individuals who quote believe in government conspiracies also framed as violent radicals
[27:50.360 --> 27:53.800]  and it says they are extremists they are terrorists you've got to go read
[27:54.600 --> 27:59.800]  the full manual and this is public i'm going to be going more over that but first i want to get to
[27:59.800 --> 28:06.600]  this intelligence effort named citizens not terrorist associated press october 3rd well they

[28:17.640 --> 28:23.960]  kids in a lifetime terrorist database if they've got a a camera taking pictures of the airplanes
[28:24.680 --> 28:30.600]  we're ordered to put people in databases if they order a vegetarian meal i'm not doing this anymore
[28:30.600 --> 28:36.920]  last time they declassified it it was two million plus people in the terror database congress people
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.880]  media people it's pure persecution i know i'm on the harassment list not to know flyless because
[28:41.880 --> 28:45.960]  they you know try to drag me off now when i fly and they know who i am and they laugh at me and i'm

[29:28.280 --> 29:33.320]  intelligence cables i put that in quotes about and jones thinks there might be a global government
[29:33.320 --> 29:37.800]  and that's part of his hate and it may lead to officers being killed global government every
[29:37.800 --> 29:42.200]  time open up the financial times of london it's announcing the world government how all my rights
[29:42.200 --> 29:46.600]  are being taken i mean what because i saw the sun come up this morning i'm a terrorist

[34:52.840 --> 34:58.600]  approval rating last time i checked the highest is about 11 percent so it's just like eight percent
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.160]  nine percent and polls believe the official story of the kennedy assassination and the media says
[35:03.160 --> 35:09.880]  90 percent of us are more that we are dangerous conspiracy theorist a tiny minority of people
[35:09.880 --> 35:15.320]  who don't even believe it themselves but understand it's part of the establishment mantra tell us

[37:15.720 --> 37:23.400]  and so now the only way to get the original one because they're totally sold out of the
[37:23.400 --> 37:29.880]  ones we held back is to sign up for the subscription the introductory offer will end very soon because
[37:29.880 --> 37:34.680]  we'll be sold out of the 3000 the next day or so at the way these subscriptions are selling but
[37:34.680 --> 37:39.880]  the most important thing is this is print 2.0 old prints dying mainly because of the propaganda
[37:39.880 --> 37:45.800]  even mainline media is dying online these statistics show you can pull them up because people don't
[37:45.800 --> 37:53.720]  trust mainstream media these are pamphlets but they're big 48 pages long but they are
[37:53.720 --> 37:59.720]  pamphleteer stuff with hardcore vital you know super hard hitting not mincing words info
[37:59.720 --> 38:08.200]  so designed to wake up friends and family people are kind of fatigued by links and videos and
[38:08.200 --> 38:12.280]  things at least a lot of them are being sent to them in their inbox but if you give someone
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.880]  which essentially is like a little book with with graphics and all the rest of it
[38:17.880 --> 38:21.720]  with shocking headlines because reality is shocking reality is sensational
[38:22.920 --> 38:28.280]  like words don't describe how sensational it is they tend to read it and incredible effects
[38:28.280 --> 38:33.720]  with the 90 000 that hit the streets one way or another we put 50 000 the streets of austin print
[38:33.720 --> 38:41.640]  another 40 000 37 000 sold out we printed a little more than 50 000 extra to sell this time

[39:00.840 --> 39:05.640]  the only way we'll lose money is if you don't buy all of them we don't make money i mean i i had it
[39:05.640 --> 39:12.760]  all numbered out here to sell these at cost as a outreach just like we give free citizen

[39:22.360 --> 39:27.720]  outreach that's the overarching mission in our hierarchy of needs sure we need to make money
[39:27.720 --> 39:31.800]  to fund ourselves and i wear that hat of a businessman you know who's out there finding

[45:10.520 --> 45:14.920]  report concludes it portrays an effort that ballooned far beyond anyone's ability to control

[45:43.400 --> 45:50.040]  jeans they say that uh are they particularly friendly that's why one time an alarm went off
[45:50.040 --> 45:55.560]  at my house the cops show up i go outside my shorts and i went yeah the wind's been blowing i think
[45:55.560 --> 46:01.080]  it made that pressure lock thank you for coming out and the cops both knew who i was whatever
[46:01.080 --> 46:05.720]  because i'd pass them after and uh you know the male cop was older he's like all right thank you
[46:05.720 --> 46:10.200]  and i shook his hand and the woman was looking at me real crazed and she goes let me see your id
[46:10.200 --> 46:17.080]  and uh luckily he was wearing shorts with pocket and i brought my wallet out just knowing and i

[46:49.400 --> 46:55.160]  looking at my id and i go you know who i am she's like just still just checking she's about mindlessness
[46:55.160 --> 47:00.840]  it's like when you see a 75 year old man i've seen him on walkers over 80 buying pipe tobacco
[47:00.840 --> 47:06.440]  and the young punk behind the walgreens counter demands to see their id or or an old man buying
[47:06.440 --> 47:11.640]  a bottle of wine who can hardly walk at at at at the local grocery store and they do it and i go
[47:11.640 --> 47:16.440]  why do you do that we're just told to yeah it's about mindlessness it's about you're not allowed
[47:16.440 --> 47:21.400]  to ever navigate anything yourself and that's how it is i can't tell you how many times we get

[47:33.960 --> 47:36.200]  that it's terrorist to even ask questions
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.680]  what began is an attempt to put local state and federal officials not servants
[47:43.320 --> 47:48.200]  in the same room analyzing the same intelligence now it's under federal control has instead
[47:48.200 --> 47:52.760]  cost huge amounts of money for data mining software yet that means violate in your fourth

[54:16.680 --> 54:22.200]  crops that are gmo but it's over 90 percent of worldwide corn in the industrialized world
[54:24.120 --> 54:30.040]  wheat's now gmo a lot of it big studies out just last week about it sterilizing the rats
[54:30.040 --> 54:36.600]  because they engineer it in every one of these gmo's is not deadly by accident i mean there could
[54:36.600 --> 54:42.280]  be probably properly tested gmo just like there could probably be some real science behind vaccines
[54:43.080 --> 54:48.920]  we're not debating all of that at least i'm not it's that global eugenicists sworn to reduce our
[54:48.920 --> 54:57.320]  population are running people caught doing thousands of lethal tests on little kids and minorities
[54:57.320 --> 55:03.560]  and veterans and and and active duty people go into the va to have something done on them and
[55:03.560 --> 55:07.640]  they just inject you with something and kill you to see what it does and then it's in the news
[55:07.640 --> 55:11.400]  yeah the government killed some people there's no big deal though nobody's getting in trouble
[55:11.400 --> 55:18.440]  we're sorry though see this is what i'm talking about these are admitted criminals running things
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.840]  of course they ship guns into mexico and killed thousands to blame the second amendment of course
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.840]  it was in mainstream news yesterday a year after we reported on it or more that the sena loa cartel
[55:28.840 --> 55:35.640]  was was working for the cia ship and drugs in that was in federal court in february of 2011
[55:36.200 --> 55:42.120]  it was in the el paso times this year chicago tribune now it's finally big news
[55:43.400 --> 55:50.520]  of course the sena loa cartel works for the cia the cia doesn't work for america it works for foreign
[55:50.520 --> 55:58.920]  banks look at who set it up os s british intelligence that's the foreign arm the domestic arm was
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.120]  sculling bones sculling bones founded it what's that literally a chapter of the illuminati
[56:06.680 --> 56:11.080]  you see truth stranger the fiction my friends and i'm i'm going to mention this briefly here
[56:11.080 --> 56:16.440]  but then i'm going to cover it more with gerald salente when he comes up uh just thought i'd
[56:16.440 --> 56:19.640]  instead of just reading one article about this i'll just give you a few headlines just to understand
[56:19.640 --> 56:23.880]  how widespread it is we reported on this five years ago and i remember the comments in youtube
[56:23.880 --> 56:30.920]  saying i was a liar i said bisphenol a 15 years ago caused men to have sexual conflictions in their
[56:30.920 --> 56:35.640]  glands it also does it in all mammals it's not a statement about sexual preference it's a fact
[56:35.640 --> 56:42.360]  that it's a government program to reduce fertility uh and now that's admitted i was i mean they had
[56:42.360 --> 56:47.000]  george soros groups attacked me big on that because they do not want that news out too late i go and
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.480]  talk radio shows all the time they bring it up now it's well known scientists developed genetically
[56:51.480 --> 56:56.600]  modified cows that produced human breast milk that's daily mail here's roiders genetically
[56:56.600 --> 57:02.040]  engineered cow milk makes anti allergy milk you know it's funny everybody i know has allergies my
[57:02.040 --> 57:09.640]  grandmother's lived here her whole life uh never had allergies has horrible ones now everyone i know
[57:09.640 --> 57:16.760]  is getting horrible allergies to where they can't eat anything can't go outside you turn on radio
[57:16.760 --> 57:21.000]  i don't listen to brian secrets but i was flipping through xm yesterday and heard him on there talking
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  about with his guest how horrible his allergies are and how folks they're spraying us it's in the food
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.360]  gmo in major studies makes your whole immune system going to overdrive not knowing what's
[57:32.360 --> 57:36.680]  what it's being attacked by not knowing what it's eating because there's all sorts of pesticides
[57:36.680 --> 57:42.360]  and chemicals and and an animal and an insect dna and this stuff your body's like whoa what is this
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.360]  i'm not used to this so you go into an autoimmune response you get bowel disorders
[57:46.360 --> 57:51.880]  it's all on record then your immune system finally just gives up and you know what that's
[57:51.880 --> 57:57.080]  called it's called cancer your immune system every week when you're a child because they can do
[57:57.080 --> 58:03.640]  blood test is defeating cancer every day past 30 you're beating cancer what happens when your
[58:03.640 --> 58:09.960]  immune system turns off what happens to eight people at hiv the cancers all over them you die
[58:09.960 --> 58:18.360]  we're all getting the beginnings of the new autoimmune disorders we're being murdered but
[58:18.360 --> 58:21.560]  don't worry they're going to have all the treatments they're going to medicalize this when
[58:21.560 --> 58:26.360]  healthcare collapses because of this government now runs it and it's going to euthanize this
[58:26.360 --> 58:30.760]  the elite will all get the life extension and i've got all these big articles how the elite
[58:30.760 --> 58:38.520]  are all not eating gmo and are obsessed with clean water okay but now now they've got well we'll
[58:38.520 --> 58:47.000]  break it down this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[58:55.000 --> 59:00.680]  year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy
[59:00.680 --> 59:06.200]  alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[59:06.200 --> 59:10.600]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy
[59:10.600 --> 59:15.800]  to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[59:15.800 --> 59:20.520]  from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise
[59:20.520 --> 59:25.320]  prices too now is the time to get your supply i recently increased my supply from e-foods direct

[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:51.160]  though you know that well the statistics are there uh cancer is off the charts uh neurological
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.600]  disorders are off the charts diabetes is off the charts the united states leads the world
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:07.720]  in lowered iq in obesity in uh organ failure in neurological disorders in cancer in endrican
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:15.320]  failure uh in illegal drug abuse in legal drug abuse uh in alcoholism we even beat russia now
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:25.080]  you name it the united states with the other european countries behind it in order is absolutely
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:32.280]  burning to the ground spiritually economically physically i mean those numbers are there people
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:38.120]  are like where's the numbers just type in us leads the world in cancer just it's all there type in us
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.640]  leads the world in diabetes us leads the world us iq dropping that doesn't see that's not education
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:52.840]  folks that's physically people are dumb physically i mean farmers the reports for decades of gmo
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:59.000]  crops killing their farm animals and they get off of it the gmo crops are not just splicing
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:07.320]  two different squash species or two different corn species they're not just doing that
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:14.760]  they are taking other plants other animals insects and firing them with gene guns into these and now
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:23.720]  hundreds of gmo crops are coming out the main nine or ten staples are gmo now
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:30.760]  and the united states again they they're always having this media spin where
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:39.560]  they're saying things like oh we're beating cancer we have a higher survival rate and they
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:45.240]  spin that like we're beating cancer that'd be like a thousand people today were being shot in your
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:52.680]  city but they said hey let's not discuss why they're getting shot we have a survival rate
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.240]  we're getting so good at treating people who've been shot through the brain that more people are
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.080]  surviving now you'd be like yeah but why are a thousand people coming in here shot a day we're
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.480]  not worried about that we're not even discussing that uh no one wants to talk about that let's
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:13.880]  just talk about why the you know how we treat this that said everyone i know including old people
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:19.000]  family who've never had allergies in their lives have allergies off the charts and what happens
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.680]  is you eat gmo you eat bisphenol a sodium fluoride this cocktail there's major studies out there on
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.840]  it just type in increased allergies linked to gmo increased allergies linked to chemical additives
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:42.280]  it's all there and people breathe in the pollen that they normally wouldn't be allergic to or
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.480]  they breathe in gmo pollen gmo's being planted everywhere where there are plants being grown
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:52.120]  that stuff blows hundreds of miles and then you have another autoimmune response because your
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:58.040]  body's saying i don't recognize this and then your body finally gives up and your immune system
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:07.160]  breaks down and then you get cancer because cancer is mainly viral later in life when dna has gotten
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.640]  broken down from radiation from the sun but also cell phones and things then you start getting it
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:18.520]  just because of a genetic malfunctions but most of it is viral scientists know this since the 20s
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:26.040]  and your body stops fighting it once it's been worn down it fights it fights it fights it fights
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:31.960]  and it finally just gives up or you take anti allergy medications that suppress your immune
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:41.640]  system but it also suppresses everything else it isn't just suppressing your you know your problem
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:48.760]  with cedar or your problem with oak your problem with hay fever or mold now it suppresses everything
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:56.120]  and so it doesn't suppress the cancer and you die and that's a big part of it you've
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.920]  heard all the countless scientists researchers we've had on i have been focused on this for 17 years
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:07.160]  and it is a holocaust that's happening pediatric cancers look it up some of them are over 10 000
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.320]  percent up there there are hundreds of new hundreds of new cancers never before seen
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.120]  that i mean we are being murdered and then there's all these globalist textbooks written by
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:22.440]  the white house science are ecoscience and others where they say in the 60s 70s 80s and 90s yeah
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.320]  we're going to engineer stuff into the food and water and reduce population that way and reduce
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:34.680]  fertility and increase morbidity reduce population and now you're just seeing the warm-up as they
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:40.200]  slowly increase it and then just normalize that everybody's dying and getting sick to everybody's
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.520]  like oh well yeah yeah hundreds and hundreds die a year from tasers killing them what's the big deal
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.320]  lady talk back she died you kind of just get used to everybody dying from tasers or get used to
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.120]  you know your neighbors yeah both the neighbors got cancer yeah his wife's 25 you know she's got
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:01.080]  she's got cancer yeah well yeah we went to her funeral last week anyways we got a tea up here in
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:08.040]  an hour yeah yeah oh yeah i'm going in i got a lump i'm going in next week oh i got it too
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.480]  and then you go be part of the jog to find the cure never find the cause because they know humans
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.480]  are actually really tough if we're not told by tribal leaders to be scared of something we're
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:22.520]  not scared of a tyrannosaurus rex okay we're not scared of you know the scariest thing we can imagine
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.680]  if everybody acts like they're not scared everybody just shows courage well let's go fight it they
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:32.920]  ever see humans are totally programmable but if you teach people to be scared oh my gosh police
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:36.680]  see a ron paul sticker on average they are shaking in fear that person's going to kill them if they
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.560]  pull them over because they were told the ron paul supporters want to kill them in the in the
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:44.840]  homeland scurry reports even though statistically that's not true it's all about the perception
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:53.400]  so that said now because of allergies i told you this was coming they're going to come out with
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.720]  oh since you're all sick you all have these disorders now don't worry they're going to come out with
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:03.480]  designer foods designer drugs for those of you that was always the plan of monsanto and others
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:09.720]  is to take over where there is no longer any real viable non-gmo then everybody gets sick from it
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:15.000]  and then they're a drug company they then sell you the treatment for what they've given you
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.520]  the ultimate business plan and uh here it is
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:27.640]  genetically engineered cow makes anti-allergy milk in china new zeal and other places they're
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:34.280]  producing it and it's it's human genes in the others of the cows that produces a human milk
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.240]  but it's part cow those cows are part human now zoological diseases can jump species between the
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:44.200]  two top scientists have warned here's one and guardian gm cow designed to produce milk without
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.400]  an allergy causing protein why are your allergies going away up though see they give you the allergies
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.320]  then they come out with something that'll supposedly fix it which will cause other problems
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:18:00.840]  but it takes so long to kill you take so long to make you sick it's it's why it's called soft kill
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:07.160]  you die 20 years later you don't know why from complications from a cocktail of stuff genetically
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:13.720]  modified cow produces allergy free milk research from study daisy could benefit infants allergic
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:23.240]  to specific protein continuing scientists create gm cow to cut milk allergies scientist fret over
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.800]  fda slowness on genetic altered animals we're already eating clones supplies of meat folks
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.640]  frankin scientists announced mutant gml cows produce engineered milk from human babies for human
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:38.680]  babies daily males scientists develop genetically modified cows to produce human breast milk
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.280]  and it goes on and on scientists genetically modified cows produce human milk they call a human
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.800]  and they don't want to be listed they want to make you drink it with whatever they've
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:54.280]  backdoor engineered on to it from china chinese military was drinking it five years ago i showed
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:03.880]  newscast here from china of it now what do we have on that front oh obama just type in obama

[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.080]  helping them get everything approved and ramming it through and so is obama and then i have the

[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:24.440]  Alex Jones we're simulcasting video at infowarsnews.com i've got a huge news blitz coming up that i've
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.200]  got to get to before Gerald Salante joins us but i want to open the phones up for callers
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.800]  to break down their take on any of the news you'd like to talk about first time callers
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:44.040]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 but again if you're a new listener and you're driving down the road
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:49.320]  you hear me claim that Mitt Romney and his wife are obsessed with only organic food
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.960]  just a search engine and you'll see literally scores of articles where they've been profiled
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:01.080]  and reporters have been in their house and that's all they eat going back a decade or more than a
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.880]  decade just look at the richer the neighborhood all you see is organic food stores all you see
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.920]  is whole foods and it's the same in china it's the same in europe it's the same in japan
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:19.080]  because ladies and gentlemen this is a eugenics program now the average rich person isn't aware of
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:27.320]  this but they follow suit with the real insiders that are obsessed with only organic food and it's
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:32.840]  come out that david rockefeller it's come out the the the british royalty in tv shows they're on
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:38.760]  they have their own organic farms they have chefs and aircraft that follow them with their purified
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:47.560]  water and their food they are obsessed with it again how do you kill wild animals you want
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.760]  to get rid of you put poison in the food uh rats they put poison in the food where it takes quite
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:58.200]  a bit of it to kill them so they go off and die far away because if there's poison that kills rats
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.040]  right away and taste bad they won't eat it it's got to build up you want to kill a bunch of coyotes
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.440]  you just poison a small water pool where they're drinking and they'll come and drink it and die
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:13.640]  this is what's being done to us and don't believe me just type in monsanto's cafeterias don't serve
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:23.000]  gmo you'll get ap cbc bbc i mean i've got the stacks right here so again i'm gonna say this
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.200]  you're told all day don't be an extremist it's in government fbi manuals that people that don't
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:41.560]  like gmo or extremist but understand the rich people all over the world in china the la times
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:53.880]  reported they have their own they have their own secret farms and in fact guys let's just show people
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.880]  this i remember the la times i covered it a few months ago uh in china uh in china elite have
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:05.000]  secret organic farms or secret organic farms in china because they don't want the public even
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:14.600]  knowing this they don't want the population to be aware of this so again i'm gonna say it
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:24.440]  for new listeners the elite will not eat gmo it came out uh three years ago four years ago
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:30.920]  that they would not give the german military the h1n1 shot and that the shots that merkel took on tv
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:38.520]  were quote special clean vaccines in fact people won't believe that if they're watching at

[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:21.160]  okay i'm gonna go to your phone calls here but if you love your family ladies and gentlemen you
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.880]  better think twice about what you're eating and drinking and what you're giving your children i
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:32.200]  mean i go to these uh children's stores and you look at the formula they're feeding children
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:39.800]  we've done breakdowns of this on air with mike adams and 70 plus percent is corn syrup or it'll
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:45.880]  be 45 corn syrup and then 20 percent sugar and then 15 percent this type of sugar and it's over
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:51.080]  70 percent sugar and then you read what mammals are supposed to drink and only a smaller portion
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:56.440]  supposed to be natural mother sugar and the rest of it protein and things i mean no wonder brains
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:05.960]  are smaller now no wonder iqs are lower look it up north american iqs are dropping iqs the cc size
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:15.640]  of the brain people are dumb for a reason and it just upsets me to know they're shooting kids up
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:19.720]  everywhere with these vaccines and the canadian government had to admit oh yeah if you took the
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:23.960]  h1n1 shot it doubles your chances of getting the flow and it destroys your immune system and then
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:28.440]  there was a russian study saying the same thing and then a us-based study i mean these are like
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:34.520]  major major medical publications it did the crazy thing is it's all admitted the federal government
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:40.680]  it came out a few months ago three months after fukushima tuna yellow fin tuna had already reached
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.800]  the san diego area and they were caught and the feds were there testing it but then didn't tell
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:49.640]  people that it had high levels of radiation because the big tuna is at the top of the food
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:55.080]  chain see all little fish it's bio accumulating and then you're eating it i've told the story about
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:03.000]  my wife and we're going to your calls she was uh in europe living in europe as a child i guess
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.160]  slash young teenager or whatever as teenager uh when chernobyl happened and they remember getting
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:13.640]  powdered milk and food from the us for more than six months and it was on the news she was i guess
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:19.640]  in italy at the time uh do not eat anything grown surface grown in europe do not drink milk
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:26.920]  because surface grown food like lettuce and things like that uh beans uh corn river the cases
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:33.800]  and milk because cows are eating grass it's it's it's raining down it's bio accumulating it builds
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.480]  up and is secreted because the body's trying to get rid of it and then you drink it nowadays
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:44.760]  i've had dr busby and others on within a few months it was 10 times more radiation coming
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.440]  into the us than what chernobyl was doing and they're just like hey we're raising the level
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.960]  of saying it's safe the elite are nuts they they've started smoking their own dope well they think
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.720]  they can avoid all this just by eating and whole foods they think they can avoid this just by having
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:05.800]  their own gardens and farms it's spreading into everything it's the old bible saying of you know
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.800]  don't dig a pit for someone else because you're going to be the one that falls into it to butcher
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:17.720]  the quote the wicked flea would none pursue they're fleeing from the poor people they want to kill
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.480]  and then they end up running off the cliff themselves i mean i just hope our species can
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:26.920]  make it all right i'm done ranting um i like to win win support our broadcast and also protect

[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:28.040]  states anymore what is fema region one is that up in main uh where are you calling from connecticut
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.840]  that's actually all of new england yeah yeah sure i was just guessing that it might be uh so you're
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.800]  calling from connecticut that's in southern fema region one formerly connecticut good to have you
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:43.560]  on with us alex thank you for everything you do i'm calling in today to bring to your audience
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.200]  attention a couple of independent independent films that i feel are relevant to current events uh
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.560]  the first film is title compliance more or less a clear representation of the training that our
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:58.920]  entire society is going through and you talked about it earlier the second film is spanish language
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:05.320]  film titled miss bala as in bullet in spanish that movie more or less accurately depicts the
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:10.200]  hellhole that life in northern mexico has become pretty much the whole entire population is
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:17.960]  you know has been taken hostage with that uh war between the mexican government and of course the
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:23.960]  drug cartels uh of course and in between the two of them working together they crushed the people
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:30.120]  in the middle pretty much i mean i'm just you know get one of your guys to look at it review it and
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:38.200]  it's pretty pretty accurate you don't know who the good guy is powerful i want to see both those
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.920]  i wish i could speak spanish but i can watch the subtitles uh what else is on your mind today sir
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:48.200]  what do you make of my breakdown of the elite won't take the vaccines won't do the gmo they
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:53.640]  they even tell newspapers this but then they want to make us see it i mean how obvious does it get
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:58.600]  they avoid it like the plague but then the police manual will say if you don't like gmo you're an
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:07.960]  extremist um approximately three years ago i was diagnosed with uh diabetes believe it or not type
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:16.040]  two so what we did is we just you know re-evaluated everything and i started eating natural uh they
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:23.400]  got me a medicine and literally the medicine got me sicker i literally stopped taking it and uh
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:30.520]  avoid the sugars avoid the processed foods and literally my blood level has gone down to normal
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:37.000]  a grant that i don't believe that i am cured but i believe that if i watch what i eat i should be okay
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.560]  well that's right uh what's the number with hispanics i know overall type two last number
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:47.560]  i saw was up over 3000 but i was seeing a number just a few months ago where within 10 years they
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:54.440]  say half of hispanics will have type two diabetes probably i believe that half of us already do
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.520]  but the thing is that you know it's not diagnosed and well you know all that's
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:03.960]  race specific uh i mean that's why uh some african countries half the women have hiv
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.200]  and then people say well wait hiv and killing all these rich people in the us who have it
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:14.680]  that's because hiv is the cover virus for other bio weapons they're releasing but they've proven
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:23.000]  that the hiv virus cannot couple with the northern europeans t lymphocytes they're not the receptors
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  it's designed to kill people of color uh and and again we just it's like oh it's just a rumor even
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.560]  though top scientists have come out about this even though the un's been caught injecting people in
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:44.680]  africa with uh hepatitis uh with hiv uh with polio and it doesn't matter we're still supposed to
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:48.840]  trust them i mean everybody knows western governments have been caught shooting people
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:54.040]  up with deadly things on purpose so why do we let them shoot us up with anything i mean isn't that
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:41:01.400]  just common sense pretty much i mean and i'm not another you mentioned that you know it's well let's
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:06.600]  put it this way um the people in line america yes there is a percentage of people who do have
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:12.760]  diabetes but it's not as bad as here or maybe they're not diagnosing it over there well well
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:17.320]  here's the deal here's the deal mexico doesn't have as much gmo but as you know in some areas half
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:25.080]  the diet is the thousands of varieties of corn that originates uh in southern mexico uh and they have
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:32.840]  every corn variety has now been infected with just one type of monsanto corn so again these are bio
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:38.200]  weapons you can't deny it designed to take everything over see plants and i appreciate your call for
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:44.280]  those that don't know they don't have one daddy and one mommy you can have hundreds of genetic types
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:52.520]  going in to a plant and then expressing their genetics that's why monsanto can plant its canola
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:58.600]  its soybeans its corn right next to you then they go in a trespass pull up your corn pull up your
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:04.760]  canola go test it and if less than one percent of their genetics is in your plant that you have
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.680]  a record you bought the seeds it's clearly not theirs it's not a hundred percent it's not even
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:16.120]  one percent theirs the courts then rule you infringed on them now that'd be like use a terrible
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.800]  analogy it'd be like if you came into my living room and defecated all over the coffee table and
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.800]  then call the police and the police came and they said hey mr. jones is trespassing on me
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.280]  i defecated on his table and the police said get up against the wall jones you're going to jail
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:37.160]  because he defecated on your table i mean i and of course i'm i'm i'm saying that to get your
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:42.360]  attention it'd be more like if somebody came to your house and put put put 10-foot cobras king
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:48.360]  cobras in your bedroom and then they bit you and your wife and you're dying and the guy that did it
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.280]  calls the cops and the cops show up he goes i put king cobras in their bedroom and they bit him and
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.920]  they're killing him i want them arrested they trespassed and the cops are like absolutely
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.800]  absolutely and the cops slap you in irons as you're dying and take you to jail for the king
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:09.480]  cobras biting you because you infringed on them they infect you and then they literally ran all
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:14.600]  the key judges because they have one federal court that decides these cases in st louis and it's
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:20.040]  their guy and then they have the head of the epa of the head of the fda they have their people

[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.960]  times was like is it wrong that the bush administration called mark cuban and said if you put out that

[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:05.800]  they emailed him we're gonna put you in prison and again mark cuban had done nothing he'd sold
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:09.560]  some stock at one of his company what even a million bucks of it they said well you're the
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.120]  owner of the company you had knowledge of something we're gonna but but you know the the mackey they

[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.760]  out names here it's just but i mean i've experienced this is how i've learned this
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:35.560]  oh they're gonna put me in jail uh if i uh put this out so i'm done and then they told cuban they
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:40.200]  go we don't care if you drop it you're still going to jail cuban beat that sec investigation
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:47.240]  it's like a crooked toenail thing dirt under his fingernails you did nothing like martha stewart and
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:54.840]  they're still going after him five years later five years later it's by the grace of god i'm
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:00.920]  still alive it is because of your prayers folks i want people to understand how real this is okay
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:07.480]  i want you to understand how real this is i had just experienced that with charlie sheen when i saw
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.360]  the thing with uh the head of whole foods i know how they work and now we've reverse engineered the
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:18.200]  whole deal so i don't even really blame whole foods they got taken over we just have to now
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:24.200]  support i mean is this the end of whole foods we have to we have to now support other places
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:29.960]  and and vote with our dollars we're in a war with these people let's go ahead and go to more calls
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:37.480]  nicole in north carolina you're on the air how you doing alex pretty good wonderful i actually
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:44.600]  wanted to get your opinion and your gut feeling on when you think the financial collapse may happen
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:52.200]  i know max kinds of keep saying april 2013 but you know me personally i just feel like something
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:56.120]  sooner is going to happen and i just wanted to see what your opinion was and maybe what gerald's
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:01.240]  the one thing that's going to us sure let me say this about max max is really smart he really did
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:07.560]  invent some of the basic virtual trading stuff used on all the markets now he was the top stock
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:11.560]  broker that worked with george soros the son at the top firm he's he's a smart guy i know he's
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:18.760]  listening right now uh but he was wrong about silver going to 500 and i disagreed with him at the time
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:23.480]  i said i don't think i go they got a lot of tricks with their sleeves but now they are being caught
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.360]  being short and silver is going back up and if it ever does break out it probably will go to 500
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:33.720]  that's what a lot of experts say it should really be at for 1970s inflation numbers if you go from
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:42.360]  1970 forward so max is right about oh man about 95 of the time he's right about stuff that i just
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:47.640]  think is wild so i'm not poo pooing max i'm sitting around my wife around the coffee table going well
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:54.280]  max has been wrong before i hope he's wrong this time but it's in the cards it's a very good chance
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.120]  what he's saying will happen and government is running around like it's about to happen
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:03.640]  they've never run around like this before they've never been digging in uh they've never been running
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.080]  around like chickens with their heads cut off like this i've never had the law enforcement
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:11.800]  sources saying october november all hadies is going to break loose but that could be hyped
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:18.440]  they're being fed as well um so i'm not listen i got a lot of family who can hardly get to work
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:24.120]  because of how much gas is most places i used to go eat have closed i live in the wealthiest
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:29.560]  city in the country per capita you know the best i live in boomtown usa austin texas number one place
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:35.000]  to live forbs money magazine you name it number one new york times they all say austin texas
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.840]  and the economy is rough here because there's also inflation i've tried to raise more money
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:48.760]  do more things so i could pay my employees a livable wage my crew uh and even though my
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:53.480]  crew has probably paid double on average what they were five six seven years ago many of them
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:59.240]  you know it's not what it used to be because things are falling apart so we're already listen
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:05.240]  a depression is three quarters of continued non-growth that's going into a depressionary
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:09.240]  slump there's a few other factors involved we were in a depression three and a half years
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:16.680]  ago according to every mainline metric so but it's such an organized depression where the elites
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:22.280]  are getting unlimited trillions and then the general public's not getting any of that largest so
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:28.680]  there's not a ton of inflation because it's only in luxury items so it's a very complex issue but
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:34.760]  it's also simple uh at the same time um so look look people are saying alex where's the war with
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:41.560]  iran you talked about i've got c span i've got the the the media saying there is a war in iran
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:48.600]  there are proxy wars in iran there are proxy wars in libya syria all over the middle east all over
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:54.920]  the world there are proxy wars now in fact here it is white house widening covert war in north america
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.440]  excuse me um because that's a Freudian slip they're attacking us here as well
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:07.720]  white house widening covert war in north africa and what's their excuse they say al qaeda is there
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:16.360]  i appreciate your call who did they put in to north africa into the middle east into central
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:22.520]  asia al qaeda who do they run the cfr two months ago said yeah we we run al qaeda we need al qaeda
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.280]  but because they haven't told us we're in a depression the average person says when is it
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:34.840]  coming because they haven't told us enough i guess that that there's giant proxy wars
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:40.280]  with hundreds of thousands of people dying there's hundreds of thousands dead in these proxy wars
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:48.760]  in afghanistan uh in libya in syria in iran in pakistan in sudan hundreds of thousands dead
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:55.720]  the last few years i mean that's a big big fat war that's a big fat hot war but it's not on dancing
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:01.160]  with the stars so people are like huh what's going on i don't think about a war the worst
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:05.960]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:12.200]  record 78 of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:17.160]  vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing

[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:27.400]  is to freeze your food cost in today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct

[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:28.920]  a war on for your mind what's going on is pretty simple you got a lot of evil people
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:34.200]  who've gotten in positions of power and they figured out ways to steal money off the public
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:40.680]  and that destroys prosperity so they've just codified agenda 21 as a political system that
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:47.560]  dresses up the implosion of society as if it's a political movement and a good thing so they can
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:54.040]  act like look what we're building as we wreck things we planned this so it's really a delusion
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:59.880]  within a fraud really they just can only steal and dump people down and poison everybody and
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.520]  then give them some treatment for it and that's what we're fighting and and we've got to get people
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:09.000]  out of their comfort zone out of their trance and upset about what's happening and it's starting
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.160]  to happen that's why the globalists are getting ready to start big wars and try to accelerate
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.280]  the collapse i mean they're already collapsing europe i mean to some areas of europe have 50
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:23.400]  percent unemployment places like spain in in uh below 30 uh they're they're they're burning down
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.280]  grocery stores all over the place i mean look at greece look at ireland's going down uh look at
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.640]  chicago look at la i mean it's halish it's here you've got the haves and the have nots and there's
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:40.280]  less and less halves and it's by design it's very scary uh so the lady's asking when is the
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:46.280]  collapse happening it started happening a long time ago i mean we've gone back to 1960s levels
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:51.800]  of wealth we've lost 40 plus years of wealth in just the last four years the federal reserve admits
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:56:00.280]  that uh that we've lost 40 years of uh of wealth generation they sucked it out though to make us
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:06.120]  poor because they want to control us it's called feudalism it's called siege it's called domestication
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:13.320]  i mean you know the old uh they had a hbo special about pimp's i was told about i found the clip
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:18.920]  online and this and this prostitute's been hit by a car she's in there all with a body cast on
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:23.080]  and the mother's in there with her and the pimp comes in and she goes oh baby baby i'm gonna get
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.960]  you the money i'm gonna get back on the street right now baby i'm gonna do everything for you
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:32.840]  right now sweetie i'm gonna do everything i can't for you he's like you better get out there baby
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:37.640]  you better get out there and do it for me right now she's like i will baby i will and the mother
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:41.480]  looks at him and said what have you done to my baby what have you done to my daughter
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:48.040]  and they asked the pimp they go what do you pay her what percentage he goes i give her nothing
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.600]  he goes she's lucky if i don't beat her you know she's lucky if i give her some fried chicken
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:00.200]  he looks at the mother and she just grovels when the mother should have just physically attacked
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.800]  him right there but but i mean this is how women are on average you know girls like the bad guy at
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:11.320]  least at least a lot of the modern women they must take a bad guy for a tough guy a lot of
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:15.720]  times and that's how you pick up the most gorgeous women as you go up make a joke at them or insult
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:21.080]  them it's it's over you know she's going home with you tonight and you treat women good they're
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:29.720]  going to treat you bad and and that's how it is you don't treat women good you treat women bad
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:34.280]  i refuse to treat women bad i just ignore them when they play their games see women are the
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:40.120]  weaker of the sex they try to dominate the male it's cave politics but you i don't want to get
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:46.280]  off into this and it's not all women but the way women have been programmed 80 percent of advertising
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:51.640]  targets women because women make the decisions so in a feminist system you don't have women in charge

[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:18.200]  for taking my call thanks for calling brother what's on your mind uh kind of a topic here i just
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:24.840]  wanted to just report on just the level of lack of respect for private property that i see seemingly
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:32.440]  on like a weekly basis just even in the apartment complex where i live um uh just real quick story
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:37.240]  last night it was like 10 o'clock in the night i'm just sitting here with my roommate and my friend
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:46.760]  who lives uh the building right across from mine we see top car pull up and an unmarked uh police
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:53.800]  pickup backup well they get out they shine the lights up in our windows and we're just like
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:02:00.120]  okay it's not really unusual to see police officers around here but they instantly go over to the
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:04.760]  building my friend lives in and they start grabbing all the bicycles and load them up in
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.960]  in the end of the pickup she goes out there she's like what are you doing you're taking my bike well
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:16.280]  it turns out they had just an anonymous tip that there was possibly a stolen bike so they were
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.640]  just going to grab everyone's bikes that they could that weren't that weren't bolted down and
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:25.160]  just take them without notifying anybody well let me expand on that uh police now i first saw this
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:31.560]  about eight nine years ago it was in a newspaper i was sent by a listener uh in illinois and it
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:37.880]  described the zoning police come in your house in the morning without a warrant to see if you have
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:43.480]  more than two toothbrushes if your house is zoned for two people and three toothbrushes is a fine i'm
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:48.680]  not kidding it was in the news and since then i've learned they have these programs where cops even
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:53.880]  during the day or night come in try your door and and and if it's open they come in and say you
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:03:00.600]  should lock your door for your safety i mean this is insane and then they've got knock and talk where
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:05.800]  they knock and then demand to come in and see your guns that goes in in the rich area of dalis
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:09.880]  imagine a cop comes to your door and says i'd like to come and look at your guns like what you
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:13.720]  what planet are you living on bob but yes they're just getting us all ready for it go ahead
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:19.160]  oh no i mean that's that's just one of the things i mean that could go on with just more
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:24.520]  more stories so what ended up happening i mean what ended up happening well it was amazing you
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.280]  know i mean they they demanded you know they demanded to see your id and then they were just
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:32.920]  asking like ridiculous questions i was just standing up on the deck watching and my friend
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.320]  you know she listens to you as well so she doesn't hesitate to stand up for her right and she was
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.400]  like no she's like i don't have to show my id i live here this is my bicycle you have no right
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:46.200]  to take it well what's happening is a property theft is exploding nationwide that's in the news
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:53.320]  and what happens is then everyone becomes guilty they ask is that your kayak let me see the code
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:58.360]  on it is that your bike and then it says stop and check but they never do it to the you know
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:03.800]  criminal types that they see slinking around it's all just an excuse in the name of stopping it to
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:10.360]  well to pimp us i'm sorry uh how did this end well she ended up after about 15 minutes of you
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:16.280]  know arguing with them finally going into her apartment getting her id showing it to them and
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:22.280]  apparently i don't know they wanted to they check the serial number against them i don't know backlog
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:26.440]  catalog that they had of just like you know stolen bikes reported but she finally got it back but
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:31.640]  there's this back it took her so long just to get it sure once things collapse we're all suspects
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:36.920]  and think of the cops with all the thefts going on out there they are legitimately get a tip okay
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:42.200]  these must be stolen bikes so once everything's criminal we're all criminal even if we're not
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:49.400]  criminal and then the cops become criminal and we all just become the scum and because they don't
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:55.640]  punish the bike thieves listen i've had cars stolen twice and the cops won't come out then
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:01.240]  i hung up on 911 and they came out and got in my face and said don't hang up on us for thousands

[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:46.680]  debate is coming up tonight uh total distraction but we'll be covering some of that uh tomorrow
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:51.000]  but but gerald i always like to ask you because we don't script these interviews we don't script
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.080]  any of them but uh a big guest like you i think occasionally i ought to talk to you behind the
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:58.680]  scenes to find out you know hey what's coming up today but you're kind enough just to come on
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:05.000]  kind of blind what is first and foremost on your radar screen right now what is stuck in
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:12.840]  gerald uh gerald salente's crawl right now out of the gates the middle east and what we're starting
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:21.320]  to read more and more is how the american government the cia the military are moving more
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:28.440]  and more into north africa and we believe they're going to use this latest libyan incident as an
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:38.120]  excuse to keep expanding america's reach into north and africa and and as we get closer to the
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:45.720]  elections and this is not a conspiracy theorist is putting the pieces together that some kind of a
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:57.800]  a terrorist attack false flag real some kind of something along the line of geopolitical already
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:05.400]  alex the it's not the economy stupid as it was during the clinton years and other years
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:12.280]  this is very very strange right now everybody including dick cheney is shifting over towards
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:16.600]  international crisis let me stop you this is amazing gerald guess what i was going to bring
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:23.000]  up to you first it's right here in front of me white house widening covert war in north africa
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:29.640]  associated press state department iran supports al qaeda taliban which is asinine those two groups
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:35.320]  are against each other shia and suni that's exactly what i was going to raise first but i wanted to see
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.600]  what you were going to say clearly the narrative from the left and the right establishment is
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:47.800]  get a big widening war going and even abc news said two days ago look for an october false flag
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:53.720]  they said look for an october surprise even when they're telling us that this is a big deal what is
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:12:00.680]  the cover of my new magazine that that has got you in it as well october surprise war i'm not
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:05.000]  tuning my horn here i'm just that's why i'm so impressed that you're right on the same page
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.440]  even though we didn't talk before the show go ahead gerald no we haven't talked at all and and
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:16.200]  pick up today's toilet paper of record the new york times look at the front page and you can see
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:22.200]  how they're throwing it out at us they're blaming and well how many people got killed in in in
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:30.280]  uh in uh iraq this past month it's like a record in the last two years and who are they blaming
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:38.600]  they're blaming iran could you imagine the americans and and their coalition of the willing
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:43.480]  that have destroyed a country on the false reasons there were no weapons the mass destruction
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:49.480]  ties to al-qaeda killed an estimated million people destroy the entire nation polluted depleted
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:56.680]  uranium and what do we kill how many of our troops are dead five thousand or so lives ruined
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:04.360]  and they're blaming iran this is right in the front page of the toilet paper of record and then
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:12.200]  you again you keep putting all the pieces together so as i mentioned here we are at a time again look
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:20.680]  at the data coming in 30 of the jobs that were created in this so-called recovery over in august
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:29.720]  are low paying jobs in fast food and and quick food restaurants so here the economy should be
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:38.920]  number one issue and neither of the candidates are really discussing it and then over on the flank
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:44.120]  we still keep hearing from israel and whether or not they're going to bomb iran
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:51.160]  within after the election before the election oh and this is very important romney has to win
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:14:00.520]  florida two weeks ago week ago obama had a four to five point lead now they're back down to neck
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:08.200]  and neck and there's a very heavy jewish influence vote in florida how is obama going to play the
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:15.080]  florida card and that yahoo card the israeli card because florida is key and if and you can see how
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:25.240]  key florida was when gore ran against bush in 2000 he was losing ohio and this is one of the swing
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:33.400]  states that romney is now taking a bad loss in that means what gore did was he dumped his money
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:41.320]  near the end of the election into florida and remember he almost won the hanging bad chads
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:47.960]  whether or not he won or not is up in the air so what i'm saying is the focus is on florida
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:57.400]  the focus is going to be to me the middle east i absolutely agree with you and my next issue in
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:02.760]  the stack is the big gmo battle going on i wanted to get your take it's just amazing how many times
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:07.240]  i've made a joke not really a joke around the office here on the nightly news and the show
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:12.920]  i go watch i'm going to have this first and then when i get gerald on watch he'll bring this up
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:17.880]  first because it's not even always whatever they've gotten the news you're just always honed right in
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:24.120]  on on what i at least think is the trend i mean i you know wrote this about a week and a half ago
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:31.560]  when we went to print october surprise war and then this week abc news comes out and mirrors our
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.360]  article in info wars magazine and says october surprise and that both parties are trying to get
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:41.320]  one going which is exactly what we say in here i say whatever the establishment you know thinks
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:44.760]  is the best puppet because they still haven't decided completely they're going to give them
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:51.240]  the false flag uh and and and and and it's so incredible to see the west put al qaeda and
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:57.960]  libya syrian iran to attack those countries into suicide bomb and then to simultaneously say today
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:03.000]  that iran is running suicide bombers when the suicide bombers are out of saudi arabia and have
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:08.920]  been landed by nato uh and are blowing up shopping malls in ancient ancient churches i mean we're
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:15.560]  talking unesco u n world heritage sites they go in and tell fathers we're going to kill your family
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:20.760]  if you don't car bomb something this is admitted and the new york times acts like they're heroes i
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:26.040]  mean i've entered a twilight zone gerald where the government publicly runs al qaeda but says
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:30.440]  they've got to grope my wife and children because of al qaeda they've got to set up highway checkpoints
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:34.200]  because of al qaeda they've got to watch my bank account because of al qaeda they've got to take
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:38.280]  all my liberties and have the nsa smile me because of al qaeda and then they're running al qaeda
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:43.720]  everywhere and then they think i'm so dumb they say we've got to attack iran they run al qaeda i
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:51.480]  mean this is this is unbelievable gerald we have a psychopaths in charge you've seen that video i'm
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:58.760]  sure floating around the internet with james baker and hillary clinton talking about iran and she
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:05.640]  goes hysterically laughing about you know what we're going to do and how we have to do this and
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:12.600]  we have to do that you watch the behavior of these people and you have to ask you know what planet are
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:20.360]  they on and so what we're looking at alex again and i cannot emphasize this enough because in all
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:27.800]  our lives every one of us that's working for a living and the people that we know so many of them
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:34.520]  they're losing their homes people are having difficulty at making ends meet up here in kingston
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:43.160]  uptown kingston every night every day i see people going through the trash barrels outside people
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:51.800]  with carts picking up empty bottles i've never seen this before and so the economy should be the
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:18:01.080]  number one issue that confronts us all on an everyday level it really does a lot to think
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:06.920]  about how am i going to get food in my mouth clothes on my back and whether or not they're
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:13.400]  going to take my home away from me and by the way just to interject into whether or not they're going
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:23.400]  to take our home my home away from me look what's going on with all the elderly people that can no
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:30.840]  longer afford to pay these exorbitant property taxes these exorbitant school taxes and they're
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:37.080]  losing their homes and so when we're looking at and then of course there's that college debt of
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:44.520]  over a trillion dollars and what are we talking about al-qaeda homeland security oh did you see
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:50.360]  that latest study that came out the billions of dollars missing that was supposed to go into
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:55.720]  homeland security so they could find us terrorists out there in the united states and what a complete
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:19:03.160]  way to define one terrorist instead they watched mainline political groups including church bake
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:08.840]  sales because that's really who the enemy is it's those that are normal it's the amish they literally
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:13.720]  put the amish in the database and have homeland security watching them under the rural affairs
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:19.320]  council run by who the department of defense because everybody knows the pentagons got to
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:28.200]  fight them amish who haven't been violent in 400 years yeah again as i've said i am convinced
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:36.600]  at this point that it's the anti-human race in charge these people are anathema to everything
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:43.240]  that is fine within the human race everything they do they destroy it you were talking about

[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:22.680]  the gmo producers and those of us that want to be able to read it on the label how dare us and then
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:29.160]  coming up mass flu vaccination drill also was practiced for an emergency this is out of the
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:37.960]  pj star newspaper and this is for a forced inoculation drill also printable gun revolution
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:44.280]  moving forward despite corporate second amendment fears after our own adon salazar wrote an article
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:50.040]  last week about an austin man who got a high tech 3d printer and was trying to make a gun with it
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:56.280]  but the manufacturer was basically contacted by the atf and came and grabbed the printer back
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:01.560]  so they're watching everything we do we're so evil trying to invent things that's you don't do
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:05.640]  that in america you don't invent things gerald salante before we go to calls you were getting
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:12.840]  into the fact that how dare americans want to label the gmo's and now they're pulling videos
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:18.840]  online on youtube critical of whole foods who's pretty much bringing in a whole bunch of gmo
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:24.600]  and working with monsanto and it's even bigger than that forget about the labeling how could they
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:31.640]  let this even happen how could they keep poisoning us like this by the way alex i have an honorary
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:37.640]  doctorate from the national university of health sciences for my work that i've done over the years
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:42.600]  in complementary medicine you know so i'm you know i've been familiar with this kind of movement
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:50.200]  you know when when the really started to to to take hold in the late 70s and that's a government
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:56.360]  in this country allows what other governments won't allow to me is really the issue but it's not
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:02.920]  really the government allowing anything it's called fascism the merger of state and corporate
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:09.000]  powers i say this over and over again they don't run the government the god we do people have nothing
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:17.080]  to say it's the corporations that are running the show by the way i also used to be in my earlier
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:24.440]  career when they were brand new i used to put together the political action committees in dc
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:32.840]  for the chemical industry that's right roman ha stupont union carbide lanza i know how it's done
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:41.960]  so what people think is out there a a governmental system that is watching them in any way for
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:48.040]  positive development their kids you know they've been they've been they they're still stuck you
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:58.760]  know in eighth grade social science class the government is totally run by the major corporations
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:06.120]  it's a takeover big agriculture the the the the military industrial complex the prison
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:15.480]  industrial complex as i said the agricultural pharmaceutical retail communications very few
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:24.520]  control everything so the issue isn't to me whether or not they should be labeling genetically
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:31.800]  modified foods the issue is what the hell are they doing here in the first place no i agree with you
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:38.600]  and that's how pathetic it is that how dare us even want to know if milk came from a cow that had
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:45.160]  human genes in its uh milk producing glands it's others how dare us want to know if salmon
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:51.000]  has an insect gene injected into us how dare us when all the studies are coming out about the
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.920]  cancer infertility look i agree they're fascist but it's worse they're eugenicist gerald and i know
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:01.800]  you've looked into this they want to reduce population this is a covert takeover operation
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.040]  briefly as we go to break and come back with calls what's your take on the overall agenda
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:13.160]  of how they actually enjoy killing us as i said they are the anti-human race we just sent you

[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:25.960]  people they're the people that we would never associate with they're the anti-human race look
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:33.800]  at the why their deeds you shall know them they're putting poisons in the air poisons in our food
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:41.640]  they're send our people to go get killed and kill others they are out of their minds look what's

[02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:19.880]  or a little less than a year ago the the bombardment started about a year and a half ago but i guess it
[02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:28.760]  was seven eight nine months ago saying that she came to libya and that uh they came they saw qaddafi
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:36.920]  died and she laughed about it haha this woman never fought a day in her life she always uses others
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:42.520]  to do it and then she makes a joke about somebody being drug around and killed but then would make
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:49.160]  fun of other people that did similar things so if somebody else drug and killed some western
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:55.880]  globalist leader it would be very solemn and barbarous and evil but then i came i saw he died
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:34:03.000]  haha like like she's julia caesar i came i saw i i conquered and they always make jokes about this
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:08.280]  richard pearl was in the new york times came over to a group of good-looking women reporters at a
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:12.520]  cocktail party six seven years ago the prince of darkness at the pentagon as he's known
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:16.440]  part of the pentagon special plans office making up the wmd lies which were admitted lies
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:23.720]  and he came over and he said i kill lots of people i order uh this war and i'm i kill lots of people
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:29.720]  i'm very powerful and the women were all creeped out and walked off come you're talking about like
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:34.040]  a 600 pound self-propelled stomach with giant black circles around his eyes i mean i'm not
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:37.960]  saying i'm the best looking guy in the world either but he looks like the penguin or something
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:43.880]  and and this is what they think is like sexy you know i i control troops that kill people
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:49.480]  and and and you watch these people i've been around globalists before at events and they are
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:55.240]  gibbering weird neurotic crazy people that are like demons running around the levers of power
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:35:01.000]  just flipping them because they can they get off on the gmo hurting you they get off on the vaccines
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.520]  it's all a big joke to them and we just bow down to these crazy pimps let's play the clip and then
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:12.280]  get gerald's taking your calls here they are on charlie rose james baker and hillary the republican
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:19.240]  the democrat uh just acting like gibbering weirdos here it is containment will not work i agree with
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:27.080]  that i i my my position my personal position on that is this we ought to try every possible avenue
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:33.640]  we can to see if we can get them to correct their their desire and and goal of create of acquiring
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:39.400]  a nuclear weapon but we cannot let them acquire that weapon we are the only country in the world
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:45.480]  that can stop that the israelis in my opinion do not have the capability of stopping it they can
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:52.440]  delay it there will also be many many side effects all of them adverse from an israeli strike but at
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:57.160]  the end of the day if we don't get it done the way the administration is working on it now which i
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:10.200]  totally agree with then we ought to take them out secretary clinton well we're working hard
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:18.760]  talk about a power trip uh if you don't see the video of her as a radio listener she smiles like
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:26.440]  a demon like a jack-o-lantern and goes when i was in bohemian grove these billionaires will get
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:33.800]  together and that's all you heard was them just just going ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and and and
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:38.920]  jack bower torturing people's kids to make them answer questions it's this evil fantasy and the
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:43.960]  federal guards raping children in front of their parents and that's in the army's report i mean these
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:49.880]  are these are people that get off on all of this and really get off on death and destruction and
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:54.360]  they've got a covert war going blowing up buildings blowing up bases suicide bombers
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:58.200]  where they threaten to kill their families and the new york times ran with that was like look

[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:53.800]  were incredibly egomaniacs out of control narcissist would not get up on newsreels and go about

[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:41.400]  hang on one of our newest affiliates 1530 wckg covering chicago welcome steve you're on the air
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:46.840]  thanks for having me the murder capital of the world isn't that something to be proud of hey hey
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:52.920]  your mayor said he wants to ask the public what they can do uh to stop the gun violence well
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:58.120]  legalized guns so people can protect themselves so all the criminals don't move there to feed off
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:03.400]  the public uh and stop letting the government the sinaloa cartel which has been caught shipping
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:09.720]  drugs into the cia stop letting them ship in their drugs decriminalized drugs uh in fact i'm
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:12.920]  interrupting you what's your question for gerald and i'm gonna ask gerald how he would try to
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:18.840]  fix chicago maybe kick the mafia out that runs it sorry go ahead i was actually my call was about
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:26.120]  the uh the bond market i used to trade in the bond pits in chicago for years and um i understand
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:31.880]  the importance behind the way the government is funded and how the treasury yields are so low
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:38.680]  right now the last time i checked a ten-year treasury is yielding about 1.63 percent and right
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:45.000]  now when we sell our bonds at that rate it's about a hundred billion dollars a year and funding
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:51.240]  costs and interest for the government now if interest rates were just to go back to a normal rate
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:56.920]  which a historically average of you know five percent you're looking at around i don't know
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:03.160]  exact numbers but it's around a trillion dollars a year in you know being able to um just to fund
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:08.280]  the interest payments now i think that's the one canary in the coal mine that sure the dollar
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:13.640]  index could go down it's trading around 79 80 something like that right now the dollar index
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:20.040]  goes down to 70 and breaks new lows of 65 it's going to cause some problems but until the treasury
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:27.400]  market bubble is bursted i don't see economically the panic in the united states like we've seen
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:32.440]  treasuries go over seven percent yeah i think what you're saying is is that as the world melts down
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:37.240]  people will go to the last island even if it's sinking it's sinking the slowest that's the
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:42.200]  united states and that that will prop things up but if you look at the overall scale everything
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:46.920]  is sinking show uh you know it's kind of like being on a house as a tsunami comes you're the
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.560]  highest house but uh you're just going to get to have the view of it overtaking the other homes
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:57.720]  i mean is what do you uh do you have a question for gerald or well this when does that bubble
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:02.680]  pop because i think that is the most important thing is the treasury market when that market
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:09.320]  starts to sell off nothing sells off like that market and people will panic when interest rates
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:13.480]  start to rise and i i'm just wondering when when he thinks that's going to take place
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:18.840]  um gerald um go ahead and take that question
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:28.600]  from the financial times Bernanke rejects rate rise talk so what they're going to do
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:34.520]  is they're going to continue to keep interest rates around the world everybody's lowering them
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:40.360]  as low as possible and what this is doing is robbing the people of their future
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:46.600]  because now you don't save any money you save what do you get if you have a hundred thousand
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:52.280]  dollars they'll give you one percent you know so they're going to continue to do this as long as
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:43:01.480]  they can and so he's a hundred percent right once these rates go up it's it but here's what
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:12.120]  i believe the rates will go up but our mind won't be on rates it'll be on war i keep saying this over
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:19.480]  and over again the first great war of the 21st century has begun there's a war in yemen a war
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:25.560]  in Bahrain a war in libya there's wars in in egypt i mean the people are taking to the streets
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:32.440]  in tunisia in syria look at the millions of people millions and millions of people
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:38.120]  in the streets of spain in portugal in Greece all right let's go to the next caller but i
[02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:42.600]  really just wanted to say this to you gerald and i appreciate your fine point and what you laid out
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:46.760]  your spot on sir good to talk to people that are so informed in some cases more than i am when it
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:58.120]  comes to bonds such a wide spectrum of information gerald constantly constantly i see the meme out
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:04.280]  there that gerald solente is a fear porn alex jones is a fear porn there's no war there's no
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:10.680]  depression i mean they're launching giant covert wars everywhere the gas is going up the dollars
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:17.160]  going down europe is literally has fires and riots major u.s cities already have it and then we see
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:23.480]  all this government preparation they're running tv ads saying prepare for the zombie apocalypse
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:29.640]  as an art type of the welfare people you know going crazy so so they're trying to tell everybody
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:34.680]  everything's fine when the big war is already started the collapse has already begun but we
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:41.560]  can't ever respond to it because the general public still doesn't even know it's already started i know
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:48.440]  are we on alex uh yes your skype is cutting out a little bit we'll reconnect during the break yes
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:55.160]  go ahead gerald yeah no the whole thing is under collapse and they don't want to admit it and
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:00.360]  they're looking at all these events as one offs when you put them all together and this is why
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:08.120]  i'm going back to the caller about rates they're going to keep rates low they have to china right
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:14.280]  now they're dumping in records amount of stimulus governments around the world are cutting interest
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:20.920]  rates they need to keep pumping look at the car numbers coming out car sales they're offering
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:28.680]  loans for nothing virtually no interest rate loans and they'll give them to anybody it's kind of a new
[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:35.880]  a new uh housing bubble but in the car market so what's going to happen rates will come up
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:41.640]  but only when our mind is off the economy sure and our mind is on war sure and more and more
[02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:47.720]  they're saying the war is next year but now abc news says there could be a false flag themselves
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:52.520]  but then i'm kooky because i said it before them i'm bad because i'm right and so are you uh let's
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:56.360]  talk to jack in florida and then we'll talk to others at jack you're on the air with your old
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:46:02.520]  salante hey what's going on we're live broadcast i've been listening to your show for about 15 years
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:08.120]  i guess four years first time calling in i'm glad you guys are talking about the gm all the stuff
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:13.000]  because that's exactly why i called even before gerald came on i wanted to get gerald's take and
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.880]  your take on this i have a theory of the floating around friends of mine been thinking about this
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:23.080]  stuff for a while now what about if this whole thing is kind of like the first batman film
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:28.360]  with jack nicholson in it remember with a newscaster talking about combinations of cosmetics
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:34.440]  that it doesn't affect you unless you do certain things like no no it's binary weapons and then

[02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:27.800]  um uh jerald uh you were cutting out a bit but i mean what do you say to people whose families
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:32.760]  laugh at them and say there's no tyranny going on i mean i would feel sorry for that family i
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:37.400]  would try to keep giving them information like the info wars magazine or the trends journal i mean
[02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:42.200]  something like that really well written with graphics and documentation to give them facts
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:46.920]  but after that i mean i would just move on i wouldn't plead with them because there's a lot
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:52.840]  of people who want to be helped and who want to be awakened uh what do you say to that well they are
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:57.800]  being awakened a lot of people are as you said you just move on on by the way to get rid of your
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:05.000]  allergy cut out wheat and dairy if you haven't already and guaranteed it'll go away sure that's
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:09.720]  a big part of it yeah yeah the gluten uh you're absolutely gotta cut out wheat and dairy you cut
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:15.480]  it out for about three weeks and you'll see all your symptoms will leave and then you can get back
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:19.800]  on it you don't have to get rid of it for the rest of your life i used to have those allergies too
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:27.640]  anyway with the other the other issue is that people don't want to face the reality everything
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:37.080]  they believed in is a lie and they can't face up to it it's like obama apologists you show them
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:44.120]  one after another how obama i'm gonna close guantanamo bay i'm gonna do away with torture but
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:51.880]  we'll move on all the seas i'm going to uh i got it we're gonna repeal the patriot act to restore
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:58.360]  habeas corpus rights you go one after another on the obama i'm not gonna hire lobbyists i'm not
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:03.960]  gonna have banker bailouts i'm not gonna sign the ndaa when he wrote it i mean it it's all about
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:10.200]  betrayal for a nation of suckers uh let's go let's go to their call mj in illinois also listening
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:17.240]  on 1530 at wckg a lot of callers getting through from that station you're on the air mj uh good
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:22.360]  afternoon gentlemen my question is um to my understanding according to the dot frank bill
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:29.560]  as of january first our bank deposits will no longer be protected by the fdic so how what way
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:33.640]  can we protect what we do have in the bank because i know we can't take everything out
[02:56:33.640 --> 02:56:38.520]  but i'm just trying to find what's the solution around this uh new well well they're already
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:43.880]  going to devalue it anyways gerald your comments on that well you know you keep as little in as you
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:47.720]  can into the banks you know why would you keep your money in there anyway when they're not giving
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:53.320]  you any interest so i just try to keep enough in there to cover my expenses you know why should
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:58.920]  i let them use my money and this whole this whole mentality again you know there's a story and again
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:04.040]  in the financial times about this lowering of interest rates and you know what the banks are
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:09.320]  doing people everybody's refinancing their homes and and the interest rate for refinance
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:15.080]  is probably about 3.4 percent but you know what it should be a lot lower considering where the
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:22.440]  fed rates are so what they're doing is not only are they're taking your money and using it but
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:27.400]  they're charging you more to get it when they're making more money with the lower interest rates
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:32.920]  so again it goes back to why should you trust them at all and that was the lesson i learned with
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:39.240]  mfglobal when they went into my segregated account robbed my money and you never heard any problem
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:45.080]  and he got caught lying and the court said hey you're allowed a lot of congress to steal money
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:51.560]  that's it and nobody brought cores line up on charges they didn't even question no he wasn't
[02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:56.600]  an old amish man selling milk to a neighbor or a girl scout selling cookies who needs to be arrested
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:00.840]  he was a you know he's a good global well he's a member of the club as you say a member of the
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:05.400]  new world order mafia thank you so much for your call mj anything else

[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:39.720]  keep fighting the last war this war is going to be very different it's going to be weapons of mass
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:45.800]  destruction but suitcase yeah why are the elites running to singapore the cook islands you name it
[03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:51.800]  i mean the elite is running they've done a great job destroying things yeah so this is going to
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:58.760]  bring down the entire global economy and by the way you see what's going on again as i keep putting
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:03.720]  all the pieces together singapore wants gold in case everything collapses they're going to confiscate
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:08.840]  it and use that gold i'm just hypothetically saying this to to be able to purchase emergency
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:14.120]  goods for an island i'm not saying that's the case i'm asking you that well when i don't when i don't
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:19.400]  like about singapore so much as its relationship with china i've been to singapore you know it's
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:26.040]  it's a branch of china in a lot of ways and i just i wouldn't put only speaking for myself i don't
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:34.680]  give financial advice but and so singapore however as the global economy particularly in the west
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:41.320]  continues to decline it's going to hit all over the world if europe and the united states are the
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:50.360]  biggest buyers of chinese and asian goods they're not buying the unemployment rate now in europe
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:57.800]  is officially at 11.4 percent more like 25 exactly and the same thing what i hear about 22
[03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:03.400]  so you're seeing you're seeing but here's my question why are the elite running to singapore
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:08.200]  that sounds like it's a good place i don't think that they're running there because you know they
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:14.920]  don't know either and they're concerned about their money and and and now you know because
[03:03:14.920 --> 03:03:20.600]  switzerland sold out you know they used to call them you know the money cockroaches of the world
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:26.840]  but now they're bending over so they don't have a lot of places to put the money so singapore is
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:33.480]  becoming the mega government class uh and the mega corporations are exempt from taxes even the
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:41.160]  rich themselves aren't exempt from what they've created exactly so the whole system is collapsing
[03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:48.520]  and to go back to the question the war has begun and what they're going to do all of a sudden you're
[03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:56.120]  going to hear about weapons of mass destruction new suitcase size nukes on and on poisoning of water
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:04:02.920]  supplies do name it it's going to start happening more and more and the more it happens the more
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:09.880]  they clamp down on us the more they clamp down on us very well said i'm sorry to all the other
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:14.440]  callers i tried to get to as many as we could i promise when we get gerald back again in the
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:19.320]  future we'll uh open the phones up again gerald we got 30 seconds what else are you looking at
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:24.760]  well gold prices and you know i've been talking about that you know for i've been naming the the
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:31.960]  breakout points as i've been on your show and when it was down about 1670 i said i was buying
[03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:39.160]  again back in the market and as we're speaking now it's 1770 an ounce my belief is if it closes
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:50.120]  out this week above 1780 an ounce get ready for the next gold bull run it goes to 2000 and above
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:57.320]  again the news is in front of everybody's eyes record low interest rates around the world
[03:04:57.320 --> 03:05:11.160]  the money presses appreciation thank you gerald i'd stand in line for this
