[08:33.160 --> 08:37.120]  of the Trump campaign Roger Stone will be in studio with us for at least an hour
[08:37.120 --> 08:44.400]  and a half today also shoot some special reports with him as well and so you

[08:47.440 --> 08:51.400]  against Trump it's like he was on with us last Friday and said get ready for
[08:51.400 --> 08:56.120]  Trump to come out and call for an audit of the Fed and then it happened on Monday
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.880]  and he just continues to basically break down where Donald Trump is coming from
[09:00.880 --> 09:05.560]  and as you've seen he's come out for 9-11 truth in the 28 pages he's come out
[09:05.560 --> 09:11.160]  for sovereignty he has come out for China not being able to have internal
[09:11.160 --> 09:15.280]  tariffs against our goods and then the media says how dare you be a
[09:15.280 --> 09:19.240]  protectionist now if they have tariffs and then we don't that's called a
[09:19.240 --> 09:27.040]  screw job so this is just default stuff coming up today then there's news like
[09:27.040 --> 09:34.120]  this one DOJ documents reveal email alias used by Eric Holder to get around
[09:34.120 --> 09:40.360]  the Open Records Act and commit felonies and that's what the head of the EPA had
[09:40.360 --> 09:44.960]  to step down four years ago about but not Holder not Hillary just want to
[09:44.960 --> 09:52.840]  illustrate that we are going to also get into the implosion of Europe they've
[09:52.840 --> 09:55.840]  got the heads of Sweden and other countries saying we are headed into
[09:55.840 --> 10:00.960]  anarchy collapse the EU will collapse within 10 days migration figures reveal
[10:00.960 --> 10:07.320]  nearly half of Britain's job growth is taken by foreign nationals and how this
[10:07.320 --> 10:11.800]  ties into the larger plan to implode Western economies and and bring us into
[10:11.800 --> 10:17.160]  third world status so we're so poor we can't be politically uppity that is the
[10:17.160 --> 10:22.920]  clowered and piven austerity impoverishment plan and that ties into
[10:22.920 --> 10:27.120]  Vicente Fox coming out and saying you're not gonna have an effing wall Trump I
[10:27.120 --> 10:34.800]  mean Vicente Fox what a gangster and kid Daniels put up a flashback to a story
[10:34.800 --> 10:43.080]  he wrote a couple years ago where Vicente Fox openly came out in speeches
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.960]  and called for an North American Union merging Mexico in the US well he signed
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.760]  a secret treaty with Bush and Paul Martin remember that back in 2005 at
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.960]  Waco and the details the treaty are still secret but they leaked through a
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.040]  Banff Canada meeting that was secret and so judicial watch sued and got those
[11:01.040 --> 11:04.800]  documents and it's the end of sovereignty and that means the end of you
[11:04.800 --> 11:09.520]  having elected governments and then these guys go and sit on the boards above
[11:09.520 --> 11:14.400]  them so these politicians and lobbyists and corporate heads are bought and paid
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.640]  for by special interest they create multinational bodies transfer government
[11:18.640 --> 11:26.000]  power to those irrevocably and then they get the positions managing it for the
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.640]  globalist I mean this is just insane so Trump comes out and says hey buddy the
[11:32.640 --> 11:38.120]  wall just got 10 feet taller look Trump is feeding people red meat on this we do
[11:38.120 --> 11:42.800]  need walls and some of the big populist areas but they're ineffective people just
[11:42.800 --> 11:49.640]  dig under them they fly over them we need to just go after employers that an
[11:49.640 --> 11:57.080]  industrial level hire illegals and do it illegally and we need to go after the
[11:57.080 --> 11:59.920]  aggravated felons and criminals that are here from all over the world and not
[11:59.920 --> 12:05.480]  let people fly in and have anchor babies China now surpassed last December the
[12:05.480 --> 12:10.080]  amount of people total from Latin America coming in with anchor babies tens of
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.000]  thousands a month of anchor babies and then we've got to pay for it you can't
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.360]  go to China and do that and they spent all this and act like Donald Trump is a
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.640]  racist and then last night Rubio and Cruz are like you hired over 1500 foreigners
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.040]  at your hotels in the US and Trump goes I never said I was against seasonal
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.320]  workers that come in legally did you hear what I said in the hottest areas of
[12:32.320 --> 12:36.360]  the country just like cruise ships in the cruise season you've got to bring in
[12:36.360 --> 12:43.560]  people that basically go all over the world working seasonally at hotels
[12:43.560 --> 12:49.280]  because in those hot areas like Florida in the summer you cannot get the help
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.240]  and I'm totally for people that seasonally come in and work and then
[12:54.240 --> 13:00.280]  they like the country make it easier for them to come here and be citizens look
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.920]  Americans I don't care if they're US citizens black, white or Hispanic once
[13:04.920 --> 13:10.000]  you get middle-class you start having two kids or less and so Americans
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.720]  aren't having kids we got to bring people in but let's bring people in who
[13:14.720 --> 13:17.760]  want to work and who want to go to college and who don't have criminal
[13:17.760 --> 13:23.640]  records no the the the globalist the liberals the Democrats they want
[13:23.640 --> 13:29.600]  dependency oh you are 6x underwear let's order 40,000 pairs of those that's how
[13:29.600 --> 13:33.120]  many obese people they thought they were bringing in oh you you you've got a
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.680]  broken back and you're from Guatemala get on a plane and get here and you're
[13:36.680 --> 13:41.840]  paid for that's why Mexico allows these corridors down the railways as long as
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.120]  you don't get off of them for people to pour in from the third world they don't
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.200]  let you stay in Mexico but you want to go to El Norte go ahead and then Joe
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.960]  Biden came out and apologized to Mexico for the mean things the Republicans
[13:54.960 --> 14:00.920]  are saying I mean this is the most ridiculous insanity but I remember I
[14:00.920 --> 14:06.640]  was going hey here's the Obamacare bill it has death panels ration care can
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.080]  computers run by bioethics boards will cut your care of the insurance companies
[14:11.080 --> 14:14.920]  wrote it to double triple charge you and screw you over and make you buy it this
[14:14.920 --> 14:19.120]  is so horrible it's unprecedented it's mainly foreign owned banks that own the
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.480]  insurance companies it's a tax to foreign corporations and the Supreme Court came
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.240]  out of your letter and said yeah it's a tax it's a
[14:29.240 --> 14:38.160]  global tribute a global ransom paid to multinationals we are such a joke and
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.440]  Trump dumps it down to hey we make bad deals no we are jokes and we're being
[14:44.440 --> 14:49.640]  sucked dry because we're soft we're lazy on average and we're stupid and I'm not
[14:49.640 --> 14:53.080]  being negative I love America there's still a lot of great people here but the
[14:53.080 --> 14:57.600]  last generation or two sits there and all this wealth and just lays around as
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.040]  soft and then complains all day about the people that are working that aren't
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.760]  giving them enough even people that have jobs a lot of them complain they don't
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.040]  have a helicopter or a fancy car or whatever when when when the poor of this
[15:12.040 --> 15:16.960]  country are the best off in the world and I am sick of hearing about it the
[15:16.960 --> 15:20.640]  homeless people folks that you meet out there that most of them don't want to go
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.600]  get one of the work job programs or the apartments provided by local and systems
[15:25.600 --> 15:29.280]  and churches they don't want help I've gone out and tried to do documentaries
[15:29.280 --> 15:33.960]  three times with Anthony where we go out and try to get somebody that doesn't
[15:33.960 --> 15:38.240]  look completely insane as a homeless person take them get clothes get them a
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.760]  job and and they'll sit there and try when we're buying them clothes at
[15:42.760 --> 15:45.920]  Dillard's to run back in and turn them back in for money even though we're
[15:45.920 --> 15:48.720]  giving them money giving them clothes trying to get them an apartment they
[15:48.720 --> 15:54.680]  don't want it they just want to run scams it's how their brains work it's like
[15:54.680 --> 15:57.800]  feral humans just running around they don't they want to sit there on the
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.480]  street I was downtown yesterday and at three different lights there were
[16:02.480 --> 16:05.840]  people with their squeegee things going you better let me clean your car you
[16:05.840 --> 16:09.000]  better try to intimidate me and I just ignored them they were going over to
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.520]  women and stuff they were giving them $10 they would grab it away from them it's
[16:12.520 --> 16:17.080]  just this country when it goes belly up in the depression is going to explode
[16:17.080 --> 16:24.880]  like a fireball of spoiled rotten zombie scum running around burning everything
[16:24.880 --> 16:27.880]  thank God we've got a second amendment we'll at least be able to protect
[16:27.880 --> 16:35.600]  ourselves and then we're lectured by the Sente Fox who he kept his people of
[16:35.600 --> 16:41.400]  slaves and sold Mexico out to the multinationals like his predecessors
[16:41.400 --> 16:47.400]  lecturing us that we have to do whatever he says we're all cowed and yes sir
[16:47.400 --> 16:51.000]  we'll use whatever words you say yes sir but here's what's big that came out of
[16:51.000 --> 17:01.840]  the debate Donald Trump really is a magnificent golden toad he's just up
[17:01.840 --> 17:10.240]  there confident and not telling anyone that he's being audited and he goes
[17:10.240 --> 17:13.560]  maybe I'm being persecuted you know like all the Christians and everybody he
[17:13.560 --> 17:15.640]  doesn't come out and say oh I'm being persecuted oh they're attacking me he's
[17:15.640 --> 17:18.720]  like yeah they're persecuting me yeah they've been auditing me over and over
[17:18.720 --> 17:22.640]  again and Carson goes I got ought to do two and never before until I gave the
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.200]  prayer breakfast that's what they do and then everybody goes oh you better not
[17:26.200 --> 17:30.120]  be politically involved you'll get audited by this criminal organization
[17:30.120 --> 17:35.600]  set up in 1913 with the Federal Reserve none of it goes to run the country it
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.040]  all goes in it's on the debt we've been maneuvered into bankruptcy and then
[17:40.040 --> 17:44.600]  here we are scared of this group that persecuted tens of thousands of
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.280]  organizations and groups and churches all the Pope runs around saying open your
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.840]  borders and all the liberal churches say GD America get rid of Christ mother and
[17:53.840 --> 18:05.960]  father is bad this is a revolution of criminal trash in our face what a joke
[18:05.960 --> 18:12.240]  what a ridiculous absolute over-the-top joke and then you've got Vicente
[18:12.240 --> 18:18.480]  Fox who looks like the archetypal medieval devil telling us that we have
[18:18.480 --> 18:22.160]  to do whatever he says along with the communist murdering Chinese and along
[18:22.160 --> 18:26.320]  with the bizarro Pope and his league of pedophile priests you know that the
[18:26.320 --> 18:29.600]  left is installed to destroy the Catholic Church their takeovers now
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.080]  complete and then we're lectured by this guy so let's go to a clip of Donald
[18:34.080 --> 18:39.480]  Trump saying on why he hasn't released his taxes they're making a big deal out
[18:39.480 --> 18:43.960]  of it came at you tonight about something that's in the news right now
[18:43.960 --> 18:47.320]  that really is at your control which is the tax returns Mitt Romney during the
[18:47.320 --> 18:50.520]  debate was bringing it up again you could show them in a second if you want
[18:50.520 --> 18:55.160]  to why is Trump delaying let me explain about Mitt you know Mitt is a guy who was
[18:55.160 --> 18:58.280]  a horrible candidate he lost a race that should have been one and should have
[18:58.280 --> 19:00.680]  been one easily and I don't know what happened he like disappeared the last
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.840]  two months but when Mitt gave his tax returns just so you understand it was
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.360]  about six months from now in 2012 it was 2012 it was exactly September 21st and
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.200]  that's when he gave his tax return we're in a different world so you know Mitt
[19:16.200 --> 19:20.480]  is just trying to remain relevant nobody's talking too much anymore he got
[19:20.480 --> 19:25.280]  some publicity today but the one problem I have is that I'm always audited by the
[19:25.280 --> 19:30.080]  IRS which I think is very unfair I don't know maybe because of religion maybe
[19:30.080 --> 19:33.600]  because of something else maybe because I'm doing this although this is just
[19:33.600 --> 19:37.720]  recently religion well maybe because of the fact that I'm a strong Christian and
[19:37.720 --> 19:41.080]  I feel strongly about it and maybe there's a bias you think you should audit it
[19:41.080 --> 19:43.600]  for being a strong person you see what's happened I mean you have many
[19:43.600 --> 19:46.280]  religious groups that are complaining about that they've been complaining about
[19:46.280 --> 19:49.320]  it for a long time so I don't know it's the ones that aren't audited I just
[19:49.320 --> 19:52.880]  think it's the answer for you no I can't do that I can't do that we have to put
[19:52.880 --> 19:56.920]  it together in a very unified way they all relate to each other I don't know if
[19:56.920 --> 20:00.360]  you saw the picture I have where I have almost a thousand things a paper the
[20:00.360 --> 20:04.240]  ones from previous relate to the ones later and it doesn't make sense unless
[20:04.240 --> 20:07.360]  they're all you know what you would do with this issue if somebody else had it
[20:07.360 --> 20:11.760]  you say we're talking about the tax returns just put it out nobody nobody
[20:11.760 --> 20:15.640]  that's under a regular audit I mean it's just a regular audit I did almost every
[20:15.640 --> 20:20.160]  year I think for 12 years 10 years 12 years I get audited nobody would ever
[20:20.160 --> 20:27.120]  put out their returns that's under an audit now look at Como if your TV viewer
[20:27.120 --> 20:31.720]  very radio listener I'll describe this body language yes saucer eyes you think
[20:31.720 --> 20:37.040]  the IRS might persecute you for political reasons or religious what they
[20:37.040 --> 20:40.600]  just go on MSNBC and say good target the conservatives and Christians and
[20:40.600 --> 20:44.800]  libertarians and veterans they're bad they're racist just we're all bad we
[20:44.800 --> 20:49.480]  just deserve to be persecuted illegally for political reasons this is an open
[20:49.480 --> 20:55.160]  group of filth exercising their bullying openly against us and then Como's
[20:55.160 --> 21:00.800]  like you mean the IRS might persecute you a front runner the New York Times is
[21:00.800 --> 21:05.520]  calling for killing and then everyone's calling you know for me destroyed in the
[21:05.520 --> 21:09.280]  establishment and that foreign governments are threatening us over from
[21:09.280 --> 21:15.520]  Mexico to China and the Pope you mean the IRS might be tough that is
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.240]  ridiculous I mean we've only seen them Nixon had a hundred and something
[21:20.240 --> 21:25.840]  names in a safe he was looking in his meetings at persecuting a few people or
[21:25.840 --> 21:30.240]  or leaking what the problem is with their taxes
[21:30.840 --> 21:35.600]  Obama has gone after more than 10,000 organizations and taken their 501 C3s
[21:35.600 --> 21:42.760]  501 C4s and others they've refused all but one in the last what is three four
[21:42.760 --> 21:49.360]  years was the Associated Press headline all 501 C3s for conservatives
[21:49.360 --> 21:58.240]  libertarians gun groups you name it Americana John Wayne Ronald Reagan
[21:58.240 --> 22:02.880]  George Washington everyone call it I mean milk toast folks milk toast groups
[22:02.880 --> 22:08.520]  they refuse them to control the process but they've not refused one leftist and
[22:08.520 --> 22:14.200]  given out more than 10,000 of them massive persecution audits indictments
[22:14.200 --> 22:19.560]  harassment like the world has never seen worse than the Soviet Union using the
[22:19.560 --> 22:25.600]  tax man to go after people and and and doing this and then Como oh my gosh you
[22:25.600 --> 22:31.160]  said the IRS might be doing something and Trump goes because see I would say
[22:31.160 --> 22:34.200]  just as they've been persecuting Christians and conservatives and
[22:34.200 --> 22:38.440]  veterans groups and others I believe they're persecuting me he lets them walk
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.200]  into it he's slicker than I am I put everything right up front Trump goes I
[22:42.200 --> 22:46.440]  think they might be persecuting me acting weak so Cuomo everybody knows
[22:46.440 --> 22:50.000]  they're persecuting everybody you know who is an anti you know who is an
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.360]  anti-American who isn't a criminal scum filth literally they just say it's an
[22:53.360 --> 22:59.360]  army of filth lying con artist scum I mean these people are the worst
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.760]  trash the planet's ever seen they've gotten fat and arrogant off America's
[23:04.760 --> 23:08.960]  prowess off of our wealth off of our innovation off of our rugged
[23:08.960 --> 23:12.760]  individualism they've all but extincted though what gave them all their power
[23:12.760 --> 23:17.920]  because they're still threatened by it because their thieves it's like scum
[23:17.920 --> 23:21.800]  that'll kidnap some beautiful model and rape her then they kill her because they
[23:21.800 --> 23:25.400]  hate how good-looking she is in criminology and they want the power over
[23:25.400 --> 23:32.240]  her because they're ugly degenerate filth in their hearts and yes we should
[23:32.240 --> 23:36.120]  hate these people they hate us they're in they're at war against us they are
[23:36.120 --> 23:40.960]  dumb trash but they know how to intimidate they know how to get in our
[23:40.960 --> 23:45.720]  face because they know good people chivalrous people honorable people are
[23:45.720 --> 23:48.880]  nice and loving and good and want to help everybody so they intimidate and
[23:48.880 --> 23:53.440]  they henpeck and they guilt trip with their social justice warrior garbage and
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.960]  it's everywhere it's everywhere in jobs and businesses and in relationships and
[23:58.960 --> 24:03.280]  in life they don't produce they don't work they don't do anything they just
[24:03.280 --> 24:07.560]  guilt trip everybody around them that they have the moral high ground and you
[24:07.560 --> 24:14.720]  don't and it's time to break the spell it's time to say no no you are
[24:14.720 --> 24:20.320]  disgusting look at the Canadian government poll and study they did three
[24:20.320 --> 24:24.400]  years ago look at the British poll they did in the UK in both the studies they
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.960]  found it fake mainline liberal environmentalists are six times more
[24:28.960 --> 24:35.560]  likely to steal and just as many times likely to lie and to not also it was like
[24:35.560 --> 24:40.000]  nine times more likely we had to pull up they study up two of them not to give
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.920]  charity but they tell you how they give charity on Facebook all day and on
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.880]  Twitter they tell you how you need to be involved in charity they tell you how
[24:48.880 --> 24:53.000]  you're bad but they don't get anybody anything because they're greedy lazy
[24:53.000 --> 25:02.040]  filth and I see it everywhere I see it everywhere it's an economy of guilt and
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.800]  manipulation the ADL is built on it the Southern Prairie Law Center is built on
[25:06.800 --> 25:12.040]  it they're all built on it you do what we say and turn your guns into your
[25:12.040 --> 25:15.040]  racist you do what we say and turn your you know let us rip you off with Obama
[25:15.040 --> 25:18.600]  carry your racist you sit there and let us open the borders up and bring in a
[25:18.600 --> 25:21.840]  North American Union and drive everybody's wages down they let people
[25:21.840 --> 25:28.680]  in with TB and AIDS and HIV and tuberculosis now and they put it in
[25:28.680 --> 25:34.640]  the associated press hey we're bringing people in with diseases I mean that's
[25:34.640 --> 25:40.240]  what the Huns would do in China and the Mongols they would they would catapult
[25:40.240 --> 25:45.080]  bodies with the black plague over the walls I mean we are under military
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.320]  attack by the globalist shutting down our power plants dumbing our kids down
[25:50.320 --> 25:53.840]  in schools breaking up the families poisoning our water poisoning our
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.160]  fields with glyphosate this is a military attack you think the globalists
[25:58.160 --> 26:01.720]  thought in the last 60 years they could just come invade America they came in
[26:01.720 --> 26:05.560]  and infiltrated it they took it over and now we are under chemical and
[26:05.560 --> 26:09.000]  biological attack and they're just slowly turning the level up will they
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.680]  notice pediatric cancer is up 10,000% will they notice breast cancer depending
[26:13.680 --> 26:16.800]  on the types of several thousand percent will they notice neurological
[26:16.800 --> 26:20.160]  disorders are up multi thousand percent will they notice all everything's
[26:20.160 --> 26:24.840]  exploding and then they have groups that are fighting all the exploding diseases
[26:24.840 --> 26:30.400]  that never make it about why is it exploding to keep control of it you are
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.720]  being murdered I don't care what dumb color you are forget what color you are
[26:35.720 --> 26:42.240]  it's eugenics you're under attack and you better understand it or it's over and
[26:42.240 --> 26:48.160]  once people pull back and think they go yeah this is actually true why does no
[26:48.160 --> 26:51.000]  one ask why there's all these new cancers it's like the New York Times on
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.800]  Monday had the headline scientists now ponder and brace for the fact that looks
[26:56.800 --> 27:02.320]  like cancer is actually communicable oh my and and next tomorrow there's
[27:02.320 --> 27:06.360]  something we just invented called a wheel
[27:06.360 --> 27:15.760]  they have known for 100 years in major university papers you can pull up the
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.840]  cancer is mainly viral and when your autoimmune system shuts down to the
[27:20.840 --> 27:28.240]  viral cancer it grows and you die you know Alice we heard this for last three
[27:28.240 --> 27:35.280]  days I know it's a big deal it's a big deal you need to be told when you're
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.120]  around someone that has cancer that it's communicable that their feces is
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.960]  communicable that their urine is communicable you're like well I have an
[27:43.960 --> 27:47.760]  immune system that's right and it has to battle too many times it turns off and
[27:47.760 --> 27:50.760]  look at everybody's immune systems are whacked out everybody's got allergies or
[27:50.760 --> 27:53.920]  sick our bodies are going I don't know what's going on but I'm fighting for my
[27:53.920 --> 28:01.480]  life I like drowning in the waves and there's like everything's fine
[28:01.480 --> 28:08.000]  everything's fine the government loves you Bill Gates loves you he's gonna make
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.120]  you take vaccines from the mosquitoes and from food it's engineered into because
[28:12.120 --> 28:16.080]  he loves you because his daddy was in black ops and ran Planned Parenthood
[28:16.080 --> 28:23.040]  and we don't just abort babies we abort people but we do it slowly and suck all
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.920]  the money out of them first you think the IRS is the only predatory group
[28:27.920 --> 28:34.400]  they're the sweetie pies and if you don't grow up folks they're gonna murder
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.600]  you and your family just remember that including everybody that works for them
[28:39.600 --> 28:43.720]  when they're done they're gonna kill almost everyone if they carry out their
[28:43.720 --> 28:47.720]  plan and don't say you weren't warned
[28:54.080 --> 28:57.360]  I ran into a Navy SEAL this morning I didn't know was a listener and I know
[28:57.360 --> 29:01.520]  the fellow that knows him that's why I knew after he left he was a Navy SEAL
[29:02.120 --> 29:07.840]  I look like Chris Kyle talk like Chris Kyle and after he left I was talking to
[29:07.840 --> 29:10.960]  the fellow that ran the business I was sending those oh yeah and I just the guy
[29:10.960 --> 29:15.400]  was just an awe talking to me and then he left well don't be an aw me you're as
[29:15.400 --> 29:18.280]  smart as I am or tougher than I am you need to get in the info war that's what
[29:18.280 --> 29:23.680]  I'm telling people is don't be an aw Alex Jones I've just broken my conditioning
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.040]  I see through the lies I can see for miles and miles and miles when we come
[29:28.040 --> 29:30.680]  back I'm gonna blitz through and I'm gonna get to these clips I'm gonna get to
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.520]  the news I'm gonna get to the war news I'm gonna get to all of it coming up but
[29:35.520 --> 29:40.160]  of course the IRS is persecuting Donald Trump and Carson they're the only two
[29:40.160 --> 29:44.880]  real candidates on the Republican side that aren't controlled in my view it's
[29:44.880 --> 29:48.520]  all intimidation will stop giving into it ought to be all you want you're on the
[29:48.520 --> 29:53.400]  match I'm not scared of your murderers you already killed everybody I know you're
[29:53.400 --> 30:01.480]  gonna kill most my family I hate you someone on Twitter asks hey if you're
[30:01.480 --> 30:04.480]  so against the left-right paradigm then why do you only talk about the
[30:04.480 --> 30:08.600]  Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders listen the Sanders tax plan will
[30:08.600 --> 30:12.200]  destroy the middle class you've got to loot the middle class because that's
[30:12.200 --> 30:16.600]  where the money is according to the tax policy center and the tax foundation the
[30:16.600 --> 30:21.640]  Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most Americans it's a very big tax
[30:21.640 --> 30:26.320]  increase for everyone except those at the bottom everybody loves to get free
[30:26.320 --> 30:29.600]  stuff and politicians are always pitching the idea that the poor and
[30:29.600 --> 30:32.880]  middle-class are gonna get the benefits and the rich will pay for it
[30:32.880 --> 30:36.440]  Americans received more than two trillion dollars in benefits from the
[30:36.440 --> 30:41.680]  federal government in 2014 Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially the
[30:41.680 --> 30:44.880]  question is where's the money gonna come from after the middle class and the
[30:44.880 --> 30:49.320]  millionaires have been looted and the mega-rich flee the country to find out
[30:49.320 --> 30:53.440]  in detail how the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class visit info

[32:40.680 --> 32:43.800]  drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my

[33:31.400 --> 33:40.880]  You better set me free. A little bit better than I used to be because I'm alive. I'm alive I don't
[33:40.880 --> 33:45.540]  guess the virtual reality headset on as a slave being fed propaganda by the
[33:45.540 --> 33:53.760]  Matrix. I got the goggles off my eyes wide open not wide shut. I'm a live wire
[33:53.760 --> 34:02.320]  and all of you are live wires as well. Come on baby. Gotta play with me. I'm your
[34:02.320 --> 34:11.360]  live wire. Money through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. It's the Alex Jones show.
[34:11.360 --> 34:17.960]  Info wars live is in the fourth hour with our great crew hosting. I pop in quite a
[34:17.960 --> 34:21.400]  bit as well special reports and more than I'll be back this Sunday hosting in
[34:21.400 --> 34:28.720]  studio live or to 6 p.m. Central for the Sunday transmission because there's too
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.880]  much news just beyond five days a week. Then of course five nights a week we
[34:33.880 --> 34:39.840]  have the enforce not only news crew did a great job covering the election via the
[34:39.840 --> 34:43.880]  super Tuesday coming up with the final Republican debate before super Tuesday
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.760]  and the highlights of that are up on infowars.com as well our analysis
[34:48.760 --> 34:52.720]  highlights that we're going to go to some of those clips right now. I have been
[34:52.720 --> 34:58.080]  so busy covering news and got so blown away when the New York Times writer came
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.840]  out and said kill Trump and it turned out that Scalia was in a bohemian grove
[35:01.840 --> 35:06.960]  Illuminati cult. At least this group was founded out of that. I'm not saying
[35:06.960 --> 35:10.200]  Scalia was part of it because they try to recruit people through these well
[35:10.200 --> 35:14.560]  meaning sounding sub secret societies that's in the Illuminati papers. I got
[35:14.560 --> 35:19.360]  so blown away by that that I didn't get to a lot of the news that was really
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.200]  important yesterday but I'm going to do that today. Again big Trump insiders
[35:23.200 --> 35:26.320]  with us for an hour and a half. Roger Stone is going to be in studio starting
[35:26.320 --> 35:31.600]  at the start of the next hour but before I go any further I've been so busy and
[35:31.600 --> 35:37.000]  so focused on that that I have not told you about a huge special that we've been
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.680]  planning for months to launch. The only time we did something like this was
[35:41.680 --> 35:46.720]  during the 24-hour money bomb broadcast so we literally only do things like this
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.880]  once a year and they were going to launch it just on Monday alone but I said
[35:51.880 --> 35:58.080]  let's do it now through the weekend and then not extend it out past Monday. It's
[35:58.080 --> 36:01.640]  unprecedented. This is only going to come around every four years. It's the
[36:01.640 --> 36:07.320]  leap year sale. This is every every four years. This is the leap year for for
[36:07.320 --> 36:15.520]  February and so unprecedented leap year sale 30% off the entire store and free
[36:15.520 --> 36:20.520]  shipping and many of the items already have discounts so those discounts are
[36:20.520 --> 36:25.040]  going to pass through as well. We're losing money with some of the items. This
[36:25.040 --> 36:28.520]  is a true loss leader and this is only going to come around every four years.
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.640]  Unprecedented leap year sale. This is bigger than Black Friday and it helps
[36:32.640 --> 36:36.720]  fund the information warfare operation obviously that you see is hitting on all
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.560]  cylinders. Whether it's survival shield, nasa9ix2, the must-have for
[36:40.560 --> 36:45.040]  everybody or oxy powder, liver shields back in stock, super male vitality sold
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.480]  out, super female vitality is in. We also again just have so many other great
[36:49.480 --> 36:54.120]  products. Hillary for present t-shirts, non-gmo, seeds, high-quality water

[37:07.280 --> 37:13.440]  weekend and through Monday and then that's it. We are going to end it Tuesday so
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.280]  take advantage of this right now. No excuses folks. You owe it to yourself the
[37:18.280 --> 37:22.720]  nutraceuticals available at m4slife.com. If you try anything do the X2 and do the
[37:22.720 --> 37:26.320]  oxy powder and do the liver shield and of course the super male will blow you away.
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.200]  I mean almost everybody I talked to I think I talked to one person and they're
[37:30.200 --> 37:33.400]  already in super good shape that didn't see it in their young but didn't see a big
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.440]  result in their libido alone and an attitude. I mean it has just incredible
[37:39.440 --> 37:47.040]  reviews with 4.8 reviews so check it all out m4slife.com or 888-253-3139 and
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.160]  m4store.com is just the big umbrella site and we also of course have 10% off
[37:52.160 --> 37:55.440]  when you sign up for auto ship and I guess this passes through with that
[37:55.440 --> 38:00.160]  discount as well so we never sell out for auto ship folks because we hold
[38:00.160 --> 38:03.080]  back that amount so that whatever item it is that you don't want to be sold out
[38:03.080 --> 38:10.680]  just sign up for auto ship at m4slife.com m4store.com or call 888-253-3139.
[38:10.680 --> 38:17.280]  Okay I want to get into now that we've talked about the unprecedented leap year
[38:17.280 --> 38:21.160]  sale. I've been trying to be four years never done it before here it is as in
[38:21.160 --> 38:26.400]  four years we'll do it again. No excuse to not support the show now folks. I want
[38:26.400 --> 38:31.160]  to thank you all for your support and salute you. The the big issue here is
[38:31.160 --> 38:36.760]  it's unprecedented I have never in history books or since I've been alive
[38:36.760 --> 38:41.960]  and since I've been politically involved that's about 25 26 years since
[38:41.960 --> 38:51.760]  high school I have never never never seen world government the pope the
[38:51.760 --> 38:58.240]  Chinese Communist murderers the Vicente Fox the dirtbag ruler of what he
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.720]  sees as his peons his slaves just absolute and slaver. I have never seen
[39:02.720 --> 39:06.360]  the Democratic Party and its plantation slaves. I have never seen the Republican
[39:06.360 --> 39:12.520]  establishment sickening curl rove types up there unified against someone they
[39:12.520 --> 39:15.960]  are scared to death of Trump because they don't own him and they want to
[39:15.960 --> 39:21.800]  own him. Is Trump perfect? Obviously not. Is he an ego maniac? I'll turn into a
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.360]  Napoleon Bonaparte? I hope not. I know this though we know we've got a eugenics
[39:26.360 --> 39:30.080]  based scientific dictatorship running things that buys and sells politicians
[39:30.080 --> 39:39.120]  like baseball cards and like pieces of art and Trump has never really worked
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.680]  with him he's never really been part of it he's been a buyer of politicians
[39:43.680 --> 39:47.480]  he's not been for sale and he's been very naked about that he goes this is our
[39:47.480 --> 39:50.480]  system I want them to leave me alone I've got to go give campaign
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.680]  contributions to everybody and he's given hundreds and hundreds of millions.
[39:57.320 --> 40:03.420]  Yeah let's see what Carl Rowe says there. Carl Rowe says time is running out to
[40:03.420 --> 40:08.320]  beat Donald Trump. Oh give me a break and that just came out yesterday and they
[40:08.320 --> 40:12.680]  are creeping around and they're even foisting the old sad obviously senile
[40:12.680 --> 40:16.160]  George Herbert Walker Bush up there with Barbara to make everybody feel sorry
[40:16.160 --> 40:21.520]  for him and love him to try to put some sicky sweet you know icing on the Bush
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.200]  dynasty of Democrats that took over the Republican Party with the Rockefellers
[40:26.200 --> 40:30.880]  and literally turned it into a criminal enterprise. No one more single-handedly
[40:30.880 --> 40:34.960]  has sabotaged the conservative paleo-conservative constitutionalist
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.280]  movement than George Herbert Walker I Love World Government New World Order
[40:39.280 --> 40:45.280]  Bush and we can see a new world coming into view with the very real prospects
[40:45.280 --> 40:52.400]  of a new world order and we will have a new world order and you find out what a
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.960]  new world order is it ain't good so that is a big deal but let's go to more of
[40:56.960 --> 41:00.720]  these clips Donald Trump again I played earlier says he hasn't released his taxes
[41:00.720 --> 41:05.040]  because you're not supposed to during an audit and he and he's released a months
[41:05.040 --> 41:09.960]  and months he's talking about releasing a months and months before Mitt Romney who
[41:09.960 --> 41:15.240]  wouldn't release his until days before the election and and let's say Trump
[41:15.240 --> 41:19.280]  isn't perfect the IRS is a criminal enterprise unconstitutional set up in
[41:19.280 --> 41:23.760]  1913 that runs around admittedly even the New York Times admits they'll go into a
[41:23.760 --> 41:27.680]  lady that's for 40-something years owned a Mexican diner in New York that only
[41:27.680 --> 41:34.200]  seats like 10 people to an old like bus you know those old old-fashioned 50-style
[41:34.200 --> 41:38.280]  things I've read the article on air many times and they said no we know you
[41:38.280 --> 41:41.280]  deposit less than a thousand dollars a day at night when you close she only
[41:41.280 --> 41:44.840]  does breakfast and lunch into the afternoon you know those old family
[41:44.840 --> 41:50.800]  diners one lady doing it all cooking and everything cooking it giving you your
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.040]  order taking your cash the old lady drives over she's been there since he was a
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.600]  young woman puts somebody in the bank paid all her taxes and they said oh we
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.640]  know you paid all the money but we can say according to the law we interpreted
[42:04.640 --> 42:08.280]  structuring because it's under a thousand dollars oh but over 10,000
[42:08.280 --> 42:12.400]  structuring but under 10,000 is to and we're just gonna take the average
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.960]  deposit like 400 bucks a day after all the expenses and the food and the
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.400]  electricity and the taxes I bet that woman was maybe bringing home six hundred
[42:23.400 --> 42:29.640]  dollars a week so poor working lady IRS took her life savings thirty-something
[42:29.640 --> 42:35.520]  thousand dollars and they did it to more than 50,000 people in 2014 alone that
[42:35.520 --> 42:40.600]  was in 2014 they go hey we know you paid
[42:41.160 --> 42:47.960]  it's like they told my dad the 80s he comes in and he goes I mean my dad would
[42:47.960 --> 42:51.960]  take me to Ronald Reagan speeches my dad would take me to Air Force bases to see
[42:51.960 --> 42:55.640]  air shows my dad just oh the US government other governments are corrupt
[42:55.640 --> 42:59.840]  ours has got problems but it's the best there is and it's so good America's so
[42:59.840 --> 43:05.160]  good I mean my dad was like Dudley do right really smart but just Americana all
[43:05.160 --> 43:14.040]  the way volunteered for all sorts of stuff and he was just dumbfounded when
[43:14.040 --> 43:18.560]  an arm of the government told him Dr. Jones we don't want your receipts or to
[43:18.560 --> 43:22.920]  talk to your lawyer we're organized crime pay us the money we're gonna take
[43:22.920 --> 43:28.560]  your house your cars and maybe even put you in prison he was a fat lady in
[43:28.560 --> 43:32.840]  there saying this time and I had said well I'm gonna fight you and he fought
[43:32.840 --> 43:38.120]  him for like 10 years and finally settled for less than what they've been
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.640]  saying it was all made up and I remember my dad was just like what the he's like
[43:42.640 --> 43:45.440]  I remember at the dinner table going they said we're criminals my mom's like
[43:45.440 --> 43:54.080]  really David they said we're criminals they said we're criminals that was in
[43:54.080 --> 43:59.680]  1988 the minute George Herbert Walker Bush got an office that a retroactive
[43:59.680 --> 44:08.720]  tax and penalties that fat slob couldn't walk upstairs never been in a fight
[44:08.720 --> 44:12.040]  wasn't tough but had this government behind her and she just looked at him
[44:12.040 --> 44:16.160]  and said we're organized criminals you know what he means she goes we're white
[44:16.160 --> 44:25.680]  color criminals you give us everything I mean even corrupt Italian mafia edits
[44:25.680 --> 44:30.680]  worse didn't go into you know regular businesses and say give us everything or
[44:30.680 --> 44:34.520]  we're gonna kill you they just say give us a little piece but that's what we live
[44:34.520 --> 44:42.000]  under in bondage in this country and that's who we are and you know why this
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.960]  Soviet Union collapsed my Venezuelans collapsing my dad just pulled his
[44:45.960 --> 44:50.760]  feelers back in the 90s and just didn't work as much and didn't own things and
[44:50.760 --> 44:55.000]  sold his business and just pulled back and then two years ago because of
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.880]  Obamacare he's in medical consulting he said oh I'm just getting out completely
[44:58.880 --> 45:03.040]  it's written where no one can follow the law so they can selectively shake down
[45:03.040 --> 45:06.840]  all the medical facilities and all the mom-and-pop dental offices but all the
[45:06.840 --> 45:10.880]  big mega hospitals are basically exempt and above the law because they pay
[45:10.880 --> 45:16.080]  money to the politicians and the key law firms law firms run by people like
[45:16.080 --> 45:22.400]  Eric Holder who's above the law and my dad says I'm not an organized criminal
[45:22.400 --> 45:25.600]  I'm not gonna be involved and I'm not gonna go to the state houses and I'm
[45:25.600 --> 45:29.280]  not gonna go rub elbows and I'm not gonna be a lobbyist and I'm not gonna do
[45:29.280 --> 45:35.080]  all of this I'm done I'm not gonna deliver checks to everybody and he said
[45:35.080 --> 45:42.080]  so it's it's it's Atlas shrug America will now collapse all the filthy
[45:42.080 --> 45:47.680]  Bernie dummies all the stupid yuppies that can't even talk are gonna get what
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.760]  you want poverty and the end of prosperity and you're so stupid you
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.880]  won't even know you help do it because you're dumb cowards like your soft
[45:57.880 --> 46:03.760]  stupid filthy parents and here's the problem I have I don't have some new
[46:03.760 --> 46:07.960]  country I can run to other hard workers to build a new you know the new
[46:07.960 --> 46:13.320]  Atlantis you people have come in taken it over gotten lazy crapped all over it
[46:13.320 --> 46:19.560]  thanks a lot filth selective enforcement of the law is the first sign of
[46:19.560 --> 46:28.240]  tyranny that's a Washington Times headline Obama waiver corruption must
[46:28.240 --> 46:33.160]  stop oh yeah thousands of Democrat companies unions are all exempt from
[46:33.160 --> 46:37.000]  rape care and then they have because Obama can do whatever he wants with
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.200]  Obamacare that's how it's written he can give them actually good deals like the
[46:40.200 --> 46:46.240]  emperor oh you actually get free health care and you do but no federal aid for
[46:46.240 --> 46:51.280]  Texas and wildfires and no no no nothing for someone that made a hundred
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.040]  thousand dollars a year for 20 years you're you're it's tripled on you and I

[47:00.040 --> 47:09.880]  screw you over and then Como sits up there with Trump and goes what you're
[47:09.880 --> 47:20.400]  claiming the IRS people how ridiculous talking down to their prey their stupid
[47:20.400 --> 47:26.000]  servile viewers but here's the deal about half the country's hard-working and

[47:48.000 --> 47:53.400]  trouble in camo with an M16 to fight the poor police I'm not I'm pulling out of
[47:53.400 --> 47:56.840]  your system I'm not part of it and if anybody ever tries to go put me in a
[47:56.840 --> 48:02.400]  forced labor camp I'm going to protect myself and you'll see how many people
[48:02.400 --> 48:10.400]  want to step on a porcupine barefoot you've messed with the smart people long
[48:10.400 --> 48:18.280]  enough all right let's start getting these clips I'm ranting let's go to this
[48:18.280 --> 48:21.960]  Marco Rubio and Donald Trump vicious debate battle then we're gonna Donald
[48:21.960 --> 48:27.000]  Trump calling Cruz a liar let's go and he has been lying about about Trump but
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.760]  let's go to those clips if he builds the wall the way he built Trump towers
[48:31.760 --> 48:35.640]  he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it
[48:37.400 --> 48:43.960]  such a cute sound but here's the guy here's the guy that buys a house for a
[48:43.960 --> 48:47.200]  hundred and seventy-nine thousand he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.820]  here for three hundred and eighty thousand and then legislation is passed you
[48:51.820 --> 48:55.280]  tell me about this guy this is what we're gonna have the guy that had hired at

[50:20.000 --> 50:25.800]  we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington the pattern of
[50:25.800 --> 50:29.320]  Washington deal makers which is they make promises they break their words and
[50:29.320 --> 50:33.160]  then when anyone calls them on it they call you a liar and so that's Donald's

[54:02.960 --> 54:08.960]  these elites are so arrogant that Vicente Fox is now doubled down on CNBC and
[54:08.960 --> 54:13.200]  then use more cuss words to get attention just trying to rally all the
[54:13.200 --> 54:18.840]  illegals that are as loyal to failed state of Mexico to go vote and Chris
[54:18.840 --> 54:22.600]  Christie has come out saying that he's endorsing Donald Trump because he's
[54:22.600 --> 54:26.320]  quote rewritten the playbook on American politics yeah he's not spending
[54:26.320 --> 54:30.240]  advertising money with the political class and the lobbyists and the whore
[54:30.240 --> 54:36.160]  prostitute political pundits like Fox CNN MSNBC billions are spent with these
[54:36.160 --> 54:40.320]  networks every major election cycle especially a presidential cycle and
[54:40.320 --> 54:44.640]  they want that money they want to rule it they're the ones you notice the very
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.240]  pundits at local regional and national that tell you how to calculate the
[54:49.240 --> 54:53.560]  cabbage and then you're supposed to just go along with it all well this just in
[54:53.560 --> 54:58.240]  it just on Fox in the control room Chris Christie has endorsed him and Donald
[54:58.240 --> 55:03.320]  Trump is rewriting the playbook he's breaking the political system this is
[55:03.320 --> 55:06.520]  like the rebels blowing up the Death Star folks doesn't mean the Empire is
[55:06.520 --> 55:11.400]  beaten but it's a devastating game-changing reversal it's like in
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.960]  the final quarter and a team seven behind and then the other team starts
[55:15.960 --> 55:21.240]  getting you know two fumbles and now the home team is seven points ahead and we've
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.560]  only got five minutes left in the game we are winning now but we have to
[55:25.560 --> 55:30.000]  believe we're winning we have this loser attitude that you can't change you
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.480]  can't fight city hall death and taxes that's not true taxes aren't like death
[55:35.480 --> 55:40.320]  illegitimate unconstitutional taxes can and will be reversed especially when the
[55:40.320 --> 55:45.000]  public learns that 47% of the public doesn't pay taxes and then the elites
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.280]  don't pay taxes why does 53% of us have to pay for everything and be lectured all
[55:50.280 --> 55:53.840]  day so let's finish up with that clip we were getting into with Donald Trump
[55:53.840 --> 55:59.640]  calling him a liar's Donald Trump calls Ted Cruz a liar again here it is
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.680]  there is you are all talk and no action what I've seen up here I mean first of
[56:07.680 --> 56:11.120]  all this guy's a joke artist and this guy's a liar you have a combination
[56:11.120 --> 56:16.640]  you have a combination of factors he can't do it for the obvious reason and
[56:16.640 --> 56:20.480]  he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth what we're seeing
[56:20.480 --> 56:26.280]  with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington the pattern of Washington
[56:26.280 --> 56:29.440]  deal makers which is they make promises they break their words and then when
[56:29.440 --> 56:33.640]  anyone calls them on it they call you a liar and so that's Donald's pattern over
[56:33.640 --> 56:36.840]  and over again no the truth is he didn't support Obamacare and the truth is
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.160]  Cruz is the one that's been engaged in dirty tricks and the truth is Cruz is
[56:40.160 --> 56:43.760]  in love with the Bush dynasty and could be basically a sleeper operative of
[56:43.760 --> 56:47.840]  these people I'm not trying to become an enemy of Ted Cruz but he's the one
[56:47.840 --> 56:52.280]  that's been playing dirty it's a fact and I like a lot of stuff Cruz does but I
[56:52.280 --> 56:55.880]  tell you they need to just get behind Trump they need to understand the whole
[56:55.880 --> 56:59.400]  systems against him they're not gonna win in these primaries the system will
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.640]  destroy them as well the system is scared of Trump now here is Rubio attacks
[57:03.640 --> 57:09.040]  Trump over hiring illegal workers I know how this works I know how this works at
[57:09.040 --> 57:12.560]  these hotels and at these cruise ships on the rest of it these are registered
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.800]  through worker systems that come through seasonally it's at resorts all over the
[57:16.800 --> 57:20.520]  country and all over the world you can be down at a resort in Mexico and there's
[57:20.520 --> 57:24.680]  people from Russia and Germany and Poland and Australia I mean that's that's
[57:24.680 --> 57:29.520]  how these these these work services work it's legal but Rubio sits there and
[57:29.520 --> 57:33.960]  plays these games I thought he's this big racist Trump has never been against
[57:33.960 --> 57:38.120]  workers in the country he wants them here legally let's go to the clip but I
[57:38.120 --> 57:40.800]  also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted
[57:40.800 --> 57:43.760]  this into the campaign that you acknowledge that for example you're
[57:43.760 --> 57:47.360]  the only person on the stage that's ever been fine for hiring people to work on
[57:47.360 --> 57:50.280]  your projects illegally you hired some workers from Poland. I'm the only one of the
[57:50.280 --> 57:58.000]  stage that's hired people you haven't hired anyone. In fact some of the people you hire tens of thousands of people
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.280]  some are gonna have fake documents. You've hired a thousand people from another
[58:03.280 --> 58:10.280]  company from another country. Let me say let me finish the statement. He hired
[58:10.280 --> 58:15.080]  workers from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars so in a judgment. That's wrong that's
[58:15.080 --> 58:18.320]  totally wrong. Well people can look it up I'm sure people are googling it right now.
[58:18.320 --> 58:22.640]  Trump Polish workers you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal
[58:22.640 --> 58:28.400]  workers on one of his projects. And that's because the company didn't follow
[58:28.400 --> 58:34.040]  paperwork right. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
[58:34.040 --> 58:40.120]  It doesn't matter Rubio has that you know what eating grin we'll be back we'll
[58:40.120 --> 58:43.760]  be back folks. Roger Stone is coming in at the five after Trump insider tell your

[1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:19.880]  master now master means a master of baseball a master of golf a master we
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:24.840]  call Rembrandt a master of classical painting but because somewhere in the
[1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:29.640]  world they also call someone a slave master that's thousands of different
[1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:32.200]  uses now that word must be banned there it is
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:39.880]  Harvard abolishes master in titles in slavery fight students claim the title
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.560]  had echoes of slavery just like at other universities they want the word and they

[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:02.400]  family members who were named lynch so you get the name lynch but that's
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:05.320]  nothing to do this is the month this is the mental illness talk about a

[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:17.800]  person that helped pay for it a benefactor because we're scared by the
[1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:22.240]  word lynch and take down Martin Luther King's quotes too because he said all

[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:16.160]  second hour of the worldwide broadcast we have three hours spanning out before
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:20.720]  us for the next two hours a consummate political insider Roger Stone is going
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:23.720]  to be our guest he's also the best-selling author of the men who killed
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:27.160]  Kennedy they got turned into TV shows you name it his two new books are
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:31.400]  available at info or store.com or Amazon.com or the stonezone.com I don't
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:34.600]  care where you get them just get them these sell out quick though I had to
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:38.880]  wait months to even get them the Clintons war on women and now Jeb and the
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:45.000]  Bush crime family now I want to cover so much today with Roger Stone I want to
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  get into the fall of the Bush dynasty I want to get into the unprecedented
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:56.640]  attacks on Trump that the world has never seen before Chinese murderous
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:01.600]  government coming out we have the Mexican President Vicente Fox former
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:05.320]  president coming out Democratic parties Republican parties Carl Rove the
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:10.320]  Bushes the Clintons the Pope Obama saying you're not allowed to have him
[1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:15.960]  he's disqualified the arrogance of these people I believe will finally be there
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:18.880]  I'm doing because even though they know they're losing their viewers they're a
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:23.520]  shadow of what they were and independent media like myself and when I say 28
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:27.120]  million viewers a week we're talking about 10 million of those listening or
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:32.560]  watching in the US that's in the top five radio shows and then the other 18
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:35.600]  million we have the Google numbers I can show stone in there while the analytics
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:39.120]  is global we're big we're putting on info we're about freedom and renaissance
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.480]  we're not even you know just about domestic audiences here though I'm an
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:46.200]  American this is a fight for freedom worldwide that Ron Paul and others have
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:52.920]  talked about for true free market capitalism not this crony garbage we've
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:57.160]  got and mr. Stone in the last few decades has had the will to write best
[1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:00.400]  selling books exposing this shadow government and he's somebody that should
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:03.840]  know because he's worked inside deeply three administrations been in four
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:08.200]  administrations and it was been around since Barry Goldwater worked inside the
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:11.160]  White House with Nixon right through with Reagan helped George Herbert Walker
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:16.440]  Bush get elected but since then has basically realized and I'm just
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:19.880]  recapping what you've said before that you couldn't do as much inside anymore
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:23.000]  you could do more without just like you were the head of Trump's campaign you
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.800]  got out so that you could actually do more making your own decisions and I
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:32.080]  see you everywhere like a superhero really defending Trump's flank when they
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:36.040]  try to sneak in and take him out so I want to get into that the fall the
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:40.280]  Bush's the unprecedented attacks the fact that you have been banned and that
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:45.320]  they would say it we have banned Roger Stone from CNN because he made fun of
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:49.600]  some of our ignorant reporters this is amazing it's why they're dying but they
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:52.800]  don't care they want to set that president shut down free speech and
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:56.640]  everywhere they're arresting LePen of the Nationalist Front which is just
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:01.600]  mainline conservative in France for saying there's a Muslim invasion it's
[1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:07.040]  dangerous it is incredible the censorship of the universities Harvard just came
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:10.680]  out today and said we will no longer say masters degree because I mean masters
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:15.640]  masters at golf master Obi-Wan Kenobi's a master no no slave master banning the
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:21.360]  word Lynch the last name is now evil this is a cult of of mind control in my
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:24.880]  view and I want to just run the gamut of why they're so scared of Donald Trump
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:29.120]  killing political correctness I mean blowing a hole through it calling the
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:32.560]  Emperor's new clothes and then I get concerned and let's start here first I'm
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:37.960]  trying to shut up I'm so excited with the fact that think about this the New
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:41.360]  York Times clearly gave the green light for their columnists to come out and
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:45.760]  say we need to kill Donald Trump and we see many others saying we need to shut
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:49.680]  him down we need to arrest him the IRS needs to come after him everything you
[1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:55.680]  predicted I mean if everybody doesn't get behind Trump they're clearly siding
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:59.920]  with the establishment there's never been a clear-cut example Roger Stone and
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:03.240]  I'm just so glad in the last six months that I began to get behind Trump's
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:07.640]  reading the tea leaves and realizing no this guy's got to be for real 9-11 truth
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:11.680]  wanting to audit the Federal Reserve I mean it is just incredible what he's
[1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:15.320]  doing great to have you here delighted to be here Alex as always I know I'm
[1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:18.640]  ranting it's just so exciting but my excitement is a mirror of the audience
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:21.800]  out there I mean they're like 95% behind Trump now folks in my office that
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:25.160]  weren't for Trump are now saying no it's clear we've got to get behind Trump what
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:28.640]  do you think's happening of all the cornucopia I threw out where should we
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:33.080]  start first well this is why the establishment the insiders the DC
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:39.880]  Wall Street cabal are so upset the rise of Trump is a repudiation of 40 years of
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:44.600]  bipartisan treason it is a complete rebutiation of the fiscal policies that
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:48.320]  have left this country broke the immigration policies that have taken
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:52.880]  away our security the foreign interventionist policies that have made us
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:57.960]  spend blood and treasure for nothing the trade policies that put us at a giant
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:03.160]  disadvantage to China to Japan to Mexico Trump is naming names and he
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:07.880]  understands the Clintons and the Bushes the Republicans and the Democrats are
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:12.160]  in it together and he scares the daylights out of the establishment
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:18.000]  because normally as sadly was the case with Reagan when an outsider is elected
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.920]  president they're immediately co-opted what happens is the establishment comes
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:25.600]  around say oh mr. president you don't know how things work we know how things
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:30.280]  work here in Washington let us help you when they help you they try to undo all
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:36.240]  of your policies Trump cannot be bought he cannot be bullied he cannot be
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:41.400]  influenced he cannot be squeezed he cannot be blackmailed and that is why
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:46.720]  the political establishment is literally wetting their britches over the radical
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:51.000]  reform that Trump would bring he's going to reexamine 9-11 he's going to
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:57.120]  reexamine the origins of the phony Iraq war he's going to reexamine our Federal
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:00.840]  Reserve he's going to demand an audit who knows bankers better because he
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:04.720]  understands this political elites gonna come after him regardless even if he was
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:08.160]  a sociopath which I don't think he is he's got really cares about America he
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:11.840]  knows they're gonna keep coming after him once he gets in he's got the will to
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:15.560]  politically kill them once he's president he's a man of enormous personal
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:21.160]  courage I think that he that his life is in danger he is such a threat to the
[1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:26.400]  status quo to the ruling elite to the established order there's no way to stop
[1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:32.320]  Trump NATO now I can tell you in every one of these primary states the
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:37.080]  infrastructure controlled by his opponents was greater yet he's running
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:43.240]  up giant numbers Democrats independence African-Americans people who've stopped
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:47.360]  voting people who never voted are coming to the aid of their country he's
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:52.040]  running up numbers like I've never seen so he is so much better than his
[1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:58.800]  campaign in the sense that this is a spontaneous grassroots uprising Donald
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:02.320]  Trump shows up and thousands show up to greet him and here's the big question
[1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:05.920]  everybody asks once he gets in I know he's a smart guy I can tell he doesn't
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:08.520]  he likes prosperity he's not one of these kleptocrats that wants to make
[1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:11.480]  people poor to control him that's what this austerity globalism is all about
[1:17:11.480 --> 1:17:14.120]  he clearly is against that's why they hate him or so scared of him he's a
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:21.120]  nationalist but if he doesn't deliver on a lot of this obviously he knows people
[1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:26.360]  are going to be so hurt that that that he will get politically destroyed but
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:30.840]  he's not running because he needs to be president he's not running because he
[1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:34.680]  wants to burnish his ego or his reputation he's climbed every mountain
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:37.520]  you can climb no no I understand that but I mean you know him so well talk to
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:42.520]  him every day only for 40 years I mean tell us who Donald Trump really is at
[1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:47.600]  his essence and what you think he'll do once he's president he's a fighter he is
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:53.480]  a man of enormous courage he's a patriot he's a nationalist he's a firm
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:57.720]  believer in American sovereignty and why is he running I can sum this up he's
[1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:01.360]  tired of seeing the country go down the drain and when he says to us our leaders
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:05.800]  are stupid their decisions are stupid their decisions make no sense you want
[1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:10.840]  to give a hundred and fifty billion dollars to Iran and frozen assets that's
[1:18:10.840 --> 1:18:15.160]  a stupid decision nobody could make a decision like that who cares about the
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:20.000]  future of their country so Trump is giving up Alex an incredible lifestyle
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.960]  he's got a great family he's making himself a major target there's no
[1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:27.360]  question and he's working very hard I dare say it's been a long time since he's
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:31.280]  seen a golf course this guy loves to play golf as a form of relaxation is a
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:36.120]  form of focus but he's working harder than those who know him ever believed he
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:40.440]  would work because he sees the future of America in the balance and he
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:45.920]  understands this is it this is the moment we either save our country take it
[1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:50.400]  back and restore its greatness or we step into a thousand years of darkness
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:54.200]  Roger Stone is our guest we're gonna skip this network break this is so
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:59.720]  important looking at this I've studied history I've been involved in politics
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:04.240]  for 25 years first working for Buchanan when I was in high school I'm not a
[1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:07.100]  political insider though I'm just a person from the grassroots that got
[1:19:07.100 --> 1:19:10.760]  involved with access TV than radio the syndicated radio because I really did
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:13.840]  want to be a slave and I could see multinationals coming into killing the
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:17.600]  Bill of Rights killing the Constitution and turning myself my family into
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:21.040]  slaves I mean it really comes down to that that I'm territorial I'm not gonna
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:25.080]  have a much a special interest come in and root me out and dominate me and
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:28.760]  that's what Trump said is you know he's standing up he's sick of these politicians
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:32.320]  ruin the country and I read that article in Politico or you know how Trump did
[1:19:32.320 --> 1:19:35.600]  it and it's basically what you told me privately about he really hated seeing
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:39.200]  them kill the country he met years ago thinking about doing this he almost
[1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:44.000]  didn't do it but now that he's in it he said this he realizes he'll be pretty
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.160]  much his name is gonna be hurt he'll pretty much have to retire if he doesn't
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:51.280]  win this and and to see him not bought not controlled it's like the return of
[1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:55.520]  a man because not since Reagan have we had somebody that you know wasn't
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:59.480]  totally controlled by this political class they hate Trump because he's not
[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:03.920]  paying money for all the ads he's not hiring all the consultants this guy as
[1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:06.760]  Chris Christie just said an hour ago endorsing him has rewritten the
[1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:11.000]  political playbook it's seismic I mean I get goosebumps because and I rarely do
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:14.520]  because this is so epic I don't think viewers and listeners understand
[1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:17.920]  there's no doubt now whether Trump was for real or not and I know he's for real
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:23.160]  my gut and I can see it politically he's breaking all the taboos he is wrecking
[1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:28.080]  the insiders he is changing the system forever and it's just a manifestation as
[1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:33.880]  you said of the larger political uprising of populism and Fox News is the
[1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:36.840]  worst now I know you go on Megan Kelly and there's some nice folks over there
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:41.440]  but Fox News has this talking point oh I know it's just it's just poor white
[1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:45.520]  people and racist whites I mean it's like MSNBC now and they're just putting
[1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:49.320]  it out that you know Trump's really a Democrat and oh it's racist and all
[1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:52.480]  this because it's whites that feel like they're getting poor when his campaign
[1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:56.360]  isn't about race it's the it is so sick do you think that that tactic will fail
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:21:02.320]  well the frankly there are far more egregious offenders than Fox I've got
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:07.120]  to say a word in defense of Fox because because Bill O'Reilly Sean Hannity
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:12.200]  Sean Hannity's good on these guys have given Trump his fair shake and that he
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:14.920]  and his point of view is at least reflect even though there's orders coming
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:18.760]  down probably from Murdoch to well compare that to CNN which is the Clinton
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:23.160]  News Network all I'm saying is shouldn't Fox be more supportive of a populist
[1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:27.720]  conservative I think they are supportive okay good I do think he gets access and
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:33.360]  he gets his chance to to to lay out his case to the American people so I am not
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:38.160]  a critic of Fox but I'll say this I am a critic of CNN now it's very interesting
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:44.120]  Alex I went back and had to look since August of last year I've either been on
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:48.720]  Fox Business or the Fox News channel to talk on behalf of Trump to defend Trump
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:56.440]  to stand up for Trump 49 times I have been on CNN exactly three times since
[1:21:56.440 --> 1:22:00.600]  August so I get your point they announced that I am banned banned from
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:03.760]  what been from something I was never admitted to this gets even more
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:10.120]  comical MSNBC under pressure from media matters from America this group of
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:14.800]  twisted freaks who are Clinton apologists who the Clintons can do no
[1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:20.960]  wrong first they demand I'd be banned at CNN where I was never admitted now MSNBC
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.760]  where I have not appeared once this year and appeared once last year they've
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:29.920]  banned me how do you ban someone who's never been admitted to the end with so
[1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:33.400]  why are they announcing it just to set the president for banning people well
[1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:36.480]  because they know I have the goods on the bushes in the Clintons because they
[1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:41.440]  know as someone who was an insider for 40 years who someone who was in the
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:45.000]  service of three American presidents who worked on nine Republican presidential
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:48.800]  campaigns as someone who worked in the US Senate as an assistant to Senator Bob
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:52.600]  Dole a patriot as someone who worked in the US House is assistant to
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:56.400]  Congressman Bob Steele who is a member of the House Budget Committee they know
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:00.520]  that I've seen the inside workings of the establishment they know I have the
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:04.560]  goods on Hillary Clinton they know that I'm well aware of the fact that her
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:09.120]  husband is a sexual predator who has attacked multiple women but more
[1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:13.280]  importantly that Hillary has been an accessory after the fact in every one of
[1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:18.320]  those sex crimes they know that I'm well aware of Bill's abandoned mixed-race
[1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:23.000]  son Danny Williams who they threw away like a piece of trash and who they
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:28.160]  doctored up a phony DNA test they know that I have the keys to defeating the
[1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:32.920]  Clintons and therefore Stone must be discredited we must discredit him because
[1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:38.400]  he knows too much well now see your point you're you're right about Fox I
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:41.960]  would just expect them I mean obviously they're not as bad as CNN or MSNBC I
[1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:48.480]  would just expect them with a patriot like this a clear winner not to do the
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:52.360]  little jabs and stuff so that's why I'm upset with their they're a real news
[1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:56.560]  network when they say fair and balanced they are fair and balanced and many so I
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:24:00.600]  get it that's why they have many many of many of the talking heads there who I
[1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:04.640]  know privately personally very pro-trump and not afraid to say so and they let
[1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:11.360]  Trump and the Trump campaign get its fair share numbers then super Tuesday what
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:14.840]  do you expect to happen what's a big win versus something that isn't as good a
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:18.640]  win well what do you really think he's about to happen I still think Trump is
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:23.720]  on his is on track to win big because this is a natural phenomena it's not
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:28.040]  about paid television commercials it's not about phone banks it's not about the
[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:34.200]  party organization and who's endorsed by who this is a citizen uprising and all
[1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:38.760]  the polls have been wrong Donald Trump has always outperformed the polls he
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:43.400]  actually runs ahead of where the polls say they're going to run so here's the
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:46.520]  bad news for the Republican establishment they have always assumed that
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  as this field winnowed down as the Chris Christie's got out of the race as
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:55.560]  Jeb Bush got out of the race as the race boiled down to two candidates or three
[1:24:55.560 --> 1:25:00.600]  candidates that the all the establishment voters would galvanize behind
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:03.480]  the establishment candidate and Trump could be defeated here's what they didn't
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:07.920]  count on Trump is bringing in thousands of new people young people
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:12.520]  disaffected people's populism that's what they're right it's Andrew Jackson style
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:16.800]  populism and ironically the establishment never liked like Jackson you
[1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:22.120]  know why he was so crude he was so blunt he was so plain spoken he was so
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:26.920]  uncultured he was so so he was a truth teller of his time and he and he
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:31.480]  denounced the big banks he denounced federal control by the big banks does
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:35.320]  this sound familiar Donald Trump may be the greatest American hero since Andrew
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:40.880]  Jackson I was about to say if he gets elected it actually delivers on 20% of
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:43.360]  what he says he'll do because obviously he can't do everything he's on a
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:47.120]  dictator he'll be as big as George Washington I think I think Trump
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:50.040]  realizes that but you know him well that if he can be the guy that's the
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:56.080]  turnaround expert for America and the and the and the brand Americana that he'll
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:00.240]  be who John Wayne wishes he was and I only think in all honesty that it'll
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:03.800]  take one term he only wants one term because he's going to bring such
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:09.040]  broad change to the country let's take the wall Donald Trump knows from an
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:11.880]  engineering point of view from a construction point of view that the
[1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:16.480]  wall can be built the Mexicans say they're not going to pay for it Donald
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:19.840]  Trump's where well aware of the fact that the Mexican government is
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:25.240]  laundering millions of dollars in drug money they are a central bank billions
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:30.520]  they are the central bankers for the cartels so we'll be inditing Mexican
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:34.480]  national figures your wheel yeah we'll have a war because we're going to make
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:39.120]  them obey the law and Donald Trump will make the Mexicans stop importing
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:43.400]  billions of dollars into our country in drugs that are destroying our inner
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:47.240]  cities that are killing our young people well there's a lot of other pressure
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.320]  also that can be done because there's so many subsidies billions of years sit
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:56.800]  down there just to quote fight the drug war so there's so much leverage Mexico
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:00.560]  is basically totally dependent on the US and so for people say it's crazy he's
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:05.720]  gonna make him pay for a wall I mean Trump I believe will actually try to get
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:09.480]  that done but but what I like is him coming out and saying on at the Fed you
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:13.280]  were on a few days before he came out with those tweets and was that just
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:16.400]  spontaneous that he did that or he or had you been talking to him who who
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:19.840]  understands bankers better than Donald Trump Donald Trump understands the
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:23.440]  banker mentality he's taken more bankers to the cleaner than any businessman in
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.000]  the country he understands how they operate and he wants to know what's
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:31.200]  happening at the Fed he wants to understand the Fed's role in in our
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:35.240]  economy look I worked in the Senate I worked in the house I worked on the
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:41.360]  budgeting process there's billions of dollars of fraud and waste in our in
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:45.400]  our in our federal budget but the reason that everybody in the political
[1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:50.320]  class always talks about cutting it but never really cuts it is because every
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:54.760]  one of those dollars has been put there by somebody somebody powerful some
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:57.880]  senator some congressman some special and that's why they're scared to death
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:01.000]  is he might actually cut that off he is going to take an axe to federal spending
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.280]  look at the way he runs his own companies he runs a very tight ship he
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:08.560]  wastes not I shouldn't be scared because then all that money will just stay
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:12.520]  with taxpayers and go where you want it going to innovation going to choices
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:16.200]  you've made going to competition it will explode not a dollar that we're
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:19.360]  talking about is helping the American people in any way it's only helping
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:24.360]  special interests so now finally you have a we would have a president with
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:28.800]  the guts and the fortitude and the knowledge in the green eye shade to
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:33.440]  really cut federal spending which as you know between that and Trump's
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:39.680]  incredibly dynamic tax reform plan you would have a booming economy well
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:43.680]  look there they're genuinely afraid of him because he's a nationalist because
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:47.680]  he's a family guy he's anti-political correctness he's sick of being bullied
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:50.720]  he's sick of America being bullied but he doesn't want to start just mindless
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:54.760]  pointless wars for profit he's just good on every point I mean it's really
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:58.560]  amazing to have somebody this good and that's why they're so scared when we
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:04.640]  come back mr. Stone I want to go through strategies what my listeners all over
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:07.760]  the country and people all over the world quite frankly can do to help get
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:11.320]  Donald Trump elected and also the new attacks you're expecting all this
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:14.320]  garbage about his tax returns I think that's a really good point for him to
[1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:18.080]  make that not just say maybe I'm being persecuted by the IRS if he gets
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:22.440]  audited all the time it's obvious he's being persecuted yes and so is Carson
[1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:26.280]  people are so sick of the IRS and so if they think they're gonna bring out his
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:29.520]  taxes and demonize him over something I think that's gonna backfire it seems
[1:29:29.520 --> 1:29:33.800]  like their instincts are really turning against them and then the fall of the
[1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:38.120]  House of Bush have we now seen it and was it Donald Trump bringing up the 28
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:42.080]  pages that did it because obviously it is folks and again that's another reason
[1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:49.040]  to just say I'm all in for Donald J. Trump stay with us we're on the March the
[1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:56.200]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:03.360]  someone on Twitter asks hey if you're so against the left-right paradigm and why
[1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:06.920]  do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders listen
[1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:11.000]  the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class you've got to loot the
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:14.680]  middle class because that's where the money is according to the tax policy
[1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:19.280]  center and the tax foundation the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most
[1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:24.680]  Americans it's a very big tax increase for everyone except those at the bottom
[1:30:24.680 --> 1:30:28.400]  everybody loves to get free stuff and politicians are always pitching the
[1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:32.080]  idea that the poor in middle class are gonna get the benefits and the rich will
[1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:36.200]  pay for it Americans received more than two trillion dollars in benefits from
[1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:41.280]  the federal government in 2014 Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially
[1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:44.760]  the question is where's the money gonna come from after the middle class and the

[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:34.040]  remember landing under sniper fire it was supposed to be some kind of a
[1:34:34.040 --> 1:34:37.720]  greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:41.080]  to get into the vehicles

[1:35:20.740 --> 1:35:25.240]  next hour and next hour I'm gonna open the phones up for first-time callers that
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:30.760]  have a specific question for mr. Stone huge Trump insider former head of his
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:37.000]  campaign and also if you disagree with Trump you're welcome to call in as well
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.400]  so I'm gonna go ahead give the number out now it would be about 30 minutes till we
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:47.980]  go to your calls 800-259-9231-800-259-9331 now I've been kind of
[1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:50.720]  ranting and asking my questions he's got a bunch of points he wants to get in
[1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:55.280]  to the real plan to steal the election from Trump but sunshine can stop it then
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:59.600]  the fall of a house of Bush that's kind of old news now but I want to do a post
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:03.040]  mortem on it because it shows where the whole power structure is going if they
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:07.280]  don't get smart and stop cannibalizing the golden goose that's all coming up
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:11.480]  his two books are available at infowarstore.com the Clinton's war on
[1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:16.480]  women and Jeb and the Bush crime family and this is the guy to a great extent
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:21.520]  advising Donald Trump and so that obviously is another reason the power
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:25.160]  structure is so scared and you noticed whenever Stone was in here four or five
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:28.960]  months ago he said watch Trump is gonna go after the Bush crime families and go
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:33.840]  after Clinton for the raping and her covering it up and he did it all so we
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:37.920]  literally are talking to the Trump insider here right now it's so exciting
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:40.880]  the establishment media is tearing their hair out about this he's gonna be
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:44.200]  speaking tomorrow night I will have a camera crew there covering it I don't
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:47.200]  want to say I'm gonna show up and and you're getting away but I might pop in
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:52.600]  towards the end at brave new books in downtown Austin down by UT at Guadalupe
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:56.040]  I'm trying to get to speak at UT I spoke there and they fill the whole hall
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:59.800]  2,000 people but believe me you'll want to get there early because about a hundred
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:02.440]  people can get into the downstairs area about a hundred upstairs so you'll get
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:06.600]  to meeting regardless and they'll have lines around the building believe me but
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:10.880]  that is seven o'clock tomorrow on Saturday brave new books and we're gonna
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:14.360]  shoot his speech in the near excerpts of it because everything he says is so good
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:19.920]  on the Sunday show that I'll be hosting 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time but I'm
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:23.480]  definitely gonna send a crew down there and do a Facebook mentions daring his
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:27.720]  speech that'll get millions of views and I'm going to do a periscope down there
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:31.000]  the issue is his Facebook mentions supposed to be personal that's why I
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.920]  may be in the parking lot and start the video and then send it in and not go in
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:37.520]  I mean I want to be there but again it turns into a circus so that's tomorrow
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:43.520]  night brave new books downtown Austin Texas be sure and be there and then
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:48.320]  we'll talk to folks obviously live on Facebook mentions and more who want to
[1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:52.000]  make their comments as well we're gonna go for a few hours tomorrow night because
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.480]  this is a really important event I'm told a lot of newspapers and TV are gonna
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:38:00.280]  be there covering as well so that's fantastic will stone himself defeat the
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:04.000]  globalist no but all of us together backing him and Donald Trump and others

[1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:15.840]  and death threats ensued and they said look this is about eight years ago I was
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:20.200]  told by the establishment shut up leave us alone and we got syndication deals

[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:10.240]  they want to do a Nounsit like they control the narrative now I'm ranting
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:14.360]  Mr. Stone you've got the floor right through for the next 12 minutes till we
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:19.320]  got a break. Here's my big concern Alex unlike with Ronald Reagan at a certain
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:23.720]  point the political establishment realized that the Reagan avalanche
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:27.920]  could not be stopped and therefore they first they tried to force former
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:31.600]  president Gerald Ford on him for vice president and then they ultimately did
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:35.880]  force George HW Bush on him that was the price of peace that was the price of a
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:40.000]  united Republican Party also they began to see that Reagan could defeat Carter
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.240]  and of course they wanted to get their nose back into the trough and they
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:46.600]  figured don't worry about Reagan once he's president we can surround him with
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:49.480]  our people we can co-opt him and that was back when we're still kind of two
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:54.320]  parties yes indeed now I have no illusions here the bushes have not given
[1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:57.840]  up terrific story in the New York Daily News about how the Bush family will now
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:02.440]  swing their rate wait first behind Marco Rubio they put the little skirmish with
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:08.760]  Rubio who is their protege behind them and now they are all out to stop to stop
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:13.440]  Trump make no maybe make no mistake about this Barbara Bush will be out
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:17.520]  campaigning for Hillary Clinton this fall if Donald Trump is the nominee so
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:21.560]  the financial wherewithal and the Bush they call each other family that they're
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:24.960]  very close because they've stolen together because they've profiteered
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:29.400]  together as a fake fake charities together yes four of them all of which
[1:41:29.400 --> 1:41:36.120]  are complete and total financial scams so don't write Jeb off Jeb's now looking
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:40.960]  at four years from now and they got George P he's the land commissioner here
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:45.840]  in Texas he's waiting in the wings these people are criminals they wrap
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.120]  themselves in patriotism yet they've never made an honest dime in their lives
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:54.280]  and they have profiteered mightily from the system don't think that Jeb is just
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:57.400]  licking his wounds and writing off into the Sun so folks you need to
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:02.320]  understand you're about to get the inside baseball on how they plan to
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:06.680]  sabotage Trump at the convention or pass that at the election so give us give
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:10.480]  us the battle plan general yes here's what's gonna happen first of all the
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:14.680]  rules for the convention have to be adopted before the convention most
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:19.480]  egregious is rule 40 b this was originally passed by the Romney people to
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:24.480]  jam one of my heroes Ron Paul Ron Paul legitimately won delegates but they
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:27.480]  didn't want those delegates even to be registered in the convention and they
[1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:30.640]  wouldn't let this congressman a Republican congressman they would
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:36.120]  never allow his name to even be put in nomination so they will take rule 40 b
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:41.720]  which just before the convention must be either readopted or amended or dropped
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:48.320]  but they will use 40 b to allow someone who has not won a single delegate who has
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:53.400]  not won a single caucus or a single primary to allow someone's name to be
[1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:59.000]  put on the floor a white knight for the establishment it would have been Jeb but
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:03.880]  Jeb is now so discredited in this cycle he is so bombed out with voters that
[1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:08.200]  they know that's not credible that's why Mitt Romney is all dressed up and ready
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:12.080]  to go that's why Mitt Romney was viciously attacking Donald Trump on
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:16.440]  Twitter last night all through the debate Mitt Romney is there he's their
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:20.120]  horse he's the horse they have on the sidelines waiting to bring him in now
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  to explain how that happens the Democrats have their super delegate the
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.680]  Republicans have something similar if the if Trump doesn't get the certain
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:30.480]  number when they go the first round they're at the convention when the
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:33.840]  people pledge their delegates yes so they're planning to try to force Romney
[1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:38.120]  completely in or making VP here's the steps that they would take number one
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:41.680]  they will take away the fact that delegates are bound on the first
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:46.520]  delegate on the first ballot oh let's take New York for example the delegation
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:50.200]  to the convention from New York State will be handpicked by the Republican
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:53.920]  State Chairman Ed Cox and by the way just to back you up it was in the news
[1:43:53.920 --> 1:43:58.680]  last night that 200 top Republicans met in secret a bunch of them basically the
[1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:03.560]  delegates or the super delegates of another name in New York with Rubio's
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:08.200]  people on how to steal it exactly what you're saying is facts please continue
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:12.760]  right so they will try to unbind those delegates meaning that even if Trump even
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:17.680]  if state law in various states requires a delegate to vote on the basis of the
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:21.280]  result of the state primary they will seek to unbind them
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:25.760]  alternatively they stall Trump short of victory on the first ballot because then
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:30.080]  on the second ballot all of the binding is gone so even though I expect Donald
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:34.720]  Trump to triumph in the New York primary where his campaign is being run by one of
[1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:39.000]  the great organizers and rabble-rousers of all time my friend Carl Paladino and
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.920]  where they will thrash the establishment upstate downstate on Long Island in the
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:48.000]  New York suburbs the will of the voters can be undone by these convention rules
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:52.840]  now what I have done is start to reach out to some of my old associates some of
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:55.800]  them going back to the Goldwater campaign some of them going back to the
[1:44:55.800 --> 1:45:00.000]  Reagan campaign to pull together some of the best convention operatives in
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.640]  America today we have set up a fund to pay for their travel to pay for their
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:10.240]  hotel rooms to bring them to to to Cleveland to avoid the steal you can go
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:14.840]  to stopthesteel.com right now if you want to make a contribution so this is
[1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:18.240]  from the beginning we're launching a major move to stop them stealing the
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:21.800]  will of the voters this is how elections are really one folks and what we need is
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:26.080]  the pros we need the people who know these these these rules and they know
[1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:30.080]  the ropes here's what I do know the Bush people have manipulated the convention
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:34.640]  rules since the 80s and they know the inside game and they're prepared this
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:38.720]  to play the inside game as you point out there's a hundred and fifty super
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:42.680]  delegates the super delegates are Republican National Committee members
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:47.720]  and state chairs very few Donald Trump votes within that group so if you do the
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:52.000]  math Trump doesn't have to win 50% of the delegates up for grabs in the
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:57.640]  primaries and caucuses he's got to win 54% otherwise he's short of the magic
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:46:01.600]  number and that's what they seek so we need a landslide folks to to to override
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:06.600]  this absolutely and in all honesty at this point Ben Carson who I do think is
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:11.680]  a patriot Ted Cruz who I don't think is a patriot Ted Cruz whose wife Heidi was
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:16.120]  Condoleezza's Rice's deputy when they started the Iraq war then she went over
[1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:20.840]  to the US trade representative he is a Herbert Walker Bush minion pro no
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.640]  question he kids is where he came from it Trump actually understated the case
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:30.480]  last night Ted Cruz recruited John Robert are you saying because I believe
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:33.560]  you and I don't want to admit this to myself because I wanted to believe in
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:38.720]  him Cruz is like a Bush operative sleeper cell because the Bush name is over
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:43.920]  he literally is a sleeper cell unless he's turned against him but but he was
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:50.040]  put in power by them as I guess a tea party takeover artist do you think he's
[1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:54.240]  turning against him or is he a full operative in a minimum I think he's a
[1:46:54.240 --> 1:46:58.440]  Trojan horse this guy was became a conservative exactly four years ago
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:03.120]  prior to that he was the top issue advisor to Governor George W. Bush he
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:06.240]  recruited John Roberts to the administration now let's look at his
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:09.840]  wife Heidi I'm sure she's a nice lady Goldman Sachs she was the deputy
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:14.240]  assistant national security advisor when they gave us the phony Iraq war then
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:17.320]  she moved over to the US trade representatives office where she was
[1:47:17.320 --> 1:47:21.920]  the deputy US trade representative working on China policy that China
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:25.840]  policy Donald Trump talks so much about by the way if you go to her wiki bio
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:29.520]  those things have been airbrushed out of existence then she goes to Goldman
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:36.120]  Sachs Goldman Sachs it made two made a million dollar sweetheart special
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:41.720]  interest loan to fund Ted Cruz's ascent to the Senate now in the beginning I
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:45.680]  like Ted Cruz I like what he had to say sounded me like a patriot folks he's a
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:52.520]  quisling he's he's a Trojan horse he's one of them and he too plays a role in
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:57.080]  this effort to block Donald Trump his role now is very clear siphon
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:01.480]  conservative votes from Trump siphon Liberty votes yeah I mean the
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:05.280]  conservatives don't see the full power of Soran the full power of the new
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:10.040]  orders against Trump this is not a ruse it's real he's causing irrevocable
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:14.960]  damage to him if people don't get behind Trump Hillary will destroy a cruise or
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:18.120]  a rubio rubio is obviously a ringer you know they're waiting to make him
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:21.600]  president down the road if you don't get behind Trump you're totally insane and
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:26.440]  Alex I know this is an absolute lefak at this very moment Ted Cruz is trying to
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:30.280]  broker a deal with Marco Rubio on which he will continue to damage Trump in
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:35.160]  return for a Supreme Court seat that's what he wants so he's not only an oily
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:39.920]  lawyer a slick operator I like to call him tricky Ted this this string of
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:44.560]  sophomoric dirty tricks is beyond anything that I've seen and I believe in
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:48.720]  hard-bored politics I get it but they call you super dirty trickster but I
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:50.960]  looked at stuff you did none of that was dirty well first of all it was all
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:57.080]  legal and politics ain't beanbag but that's not the same thing as as sending
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:01.240]  threatening letters to voters to make them vote or spreading a false rumor on
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:05.600]  CNN that Ben Carson a patriot is getting out of the race and then contacting
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:09.600]  Carson voters to tell them latest oh did you hear Ben's getting out of the race
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:13.960]  switch your vote to Ted Cruz now doctoring pictures of Barack Obama and
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:19.600]  Marco Rubio shaking hands last time I saw that was in 1950 when Joe McCarthy
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:23.480]  doctored pictures of the Liberal senator from Maryland Miller tidings
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:28.200]  shaking hands with the president of the US Communist Party Earl Broward which
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:32.800]  blew Browder which blew tidings out of the Senate that's a dirty show we need
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:36.280]  a tsunami but if we don't get the total tsunami because of stuff going on in the
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:41.160]  States it looks like that's where it's going now and how do we stop them there
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:45.560]  on the floor by by putting Patriot operatives in to basically be there
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:49.520]  from the beginning saying we're watching for it we know it's coming so that if
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:53.760]  they even try it it blows up in their face because this isn't past years when
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:58.000]  folks were asleep if they try to steal this from the people I think they'll be
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:01.360]  civil unrest well that's why I've had to reach out to a number of veteran
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:05.240]  conservative operatives people who know the rules as well as the Bush's we're
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:08.720]  not without assets we're not without solid delegations to bring about Pap you
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:11.600]  can I know supporting Trump we ought to bring him down to the floor absolutely
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:15.720]  to bring all these Titans in that's exactly why we have set up stop the
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:18.960]  steel calm I'm gonna we need to get Matt drudge obviously who likes Trump and
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:22.520]  loves Trump you know he'll be involved watching for the steel yeah so I think
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:26.080]  that you know just like anything else you shed light on the cockroaches and the
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:29.840]  cockroaches will scramble we're gonna have to shed light on what they have in
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:33.920]  mind terrific piece in the Daily Beast the other day they blurted it out yes
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:37.960]  they're playing for the brokered convention who emerges is it Mitt
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:42.040]  Romney is it Marco Rubio is it John Kasich I think they've given up on Jen
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:45.760]  after this spectacle of Trump and he's the winner if they don't give it to him
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:49.800]  the public's finally gonna get it and I mean this is incredible but on the one
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:52.920]  hand you could say the party nomination would be worth nothing if they steal it
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:56.240]  from Trump on the other hand the insiders don't care about that exactly
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:00.800]  as they got Hillary already this is epic this is epic wait a minute don't spend a

[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:56.280]  questions for the consummate Trump insider Roger Stone I'm your host Alex
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:00.480]  Jones his two new books are out and of course they came out the last few months
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:03.320]  you notice you suddenly hear Trump basically talking about everything in
[1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:08.400]  these the Clintons war on women and then of course we also have Jeb and the Bush
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:12.120]  crime family but I tell you these are important books for folks to get to be
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:16.400]  educated as you attack the political establishment that are merged at the hip
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:21.480]  call each other family but to a great extent I mean let's just say it you have
[1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:24.760]  been and not folks I don't just say so if everybody knows that you've been the
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:29.560]  prime mover in getting mainstream media to face the fact of the sex crimes of
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:33.640]  the Clintons and the Bush CIA drug running and the Mina and how these two
[1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:37.680]  families work together and as soon as they brought out 911 truth Jeb's
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:41.960]  numbers went down Jeb pulled out because they were scared to death our
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:45.600]  reporters confronted them twice and they try to call it conspiracy theory his
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:50.200]  numbers only went up there are 28 pages we did attack the wrong country what do
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:54.680]  you have to say about the whole Bush dynasty and where all this is going Alex
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:59.240]  a year ago more than a year ago I set out with a good with two goals one was to
[1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:03.480]  defeat Hillary Clinton and the other was to elect Donald Trump and I knew that
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:08.240]  meant vanquishing Jeb Bush Jeb took a powder because my book lays out how he
[1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:12.160]  has never made an honest dime in his life how he has used the governorship and
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:16.000]  his family connections to profiteer and done so at the expense of the taxpayers
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:21.200]  between Lehman brothers and Enron the taxpayers of Florida law S&L the whole
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:26.520]  family is a scamming weasels there's no question and they I don't think they
[1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:31.280]  ever expected anybody to put it all together so it's there Trump build stuff
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:35.720]  and as a TV star and an entrepreneur and a celebrity and loves America the
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:40.960]  bushes literally were the main Nazi lawyers Prescott Bush they literally
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:45.240]  organized crime scum of the earth yeah look the bushes would steal a hot stove
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:48.560]  they've never made an honest dollar in their life they've traded on the family
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:53.200]  name this is a classic deal you go to an SNL you take out a fraudulent loan that
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:56.520]  you know you're never going to honor then you take the money from the loan you
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:00.600]  short the stock in the bank then the bank falls and you cash in leaving the
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:04.640]  taxpayers holding the bag that's what Neil Bush did that's what Marvin Bush
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:09.600]  did that's what Jeb Bush Jeb works with Third World African dictators well look
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:13.880]  at the guy got a four million dollar personal taxpayer finance bailout when
[1:57:13.880 --> 1:57:17.720]  daddy was the vice president he defrauded an SNL broader sit brought
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:22.800]  and Donald Trump had the nerve to go up against a crime family nobody messes
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:24.920]  with and I want to show the subredor film and I don't say this to be
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:28.160]  theatrical I said let me tell you they're looking at killing him and trying to
[1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:33.040]  figure it out I mean I know politics they he's real that's why I'm just I'm so
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:36.000]  behind him because he's in the arena folks that's easy to sit here and bitching
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:39.320]  complaining he's not perfect that guy is in the arena against the globalist you
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:42.680]  want it you got it that's what most these questions are you know he's wearing a
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:46.320]  bulletproof vest the whole nine yards I just pray to God nothing happens to him
[1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:51.000]  well this is one of the key points last night which is the IRS harassment now of
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:55.760]  Trump is an added dimension I mean not only are they out of control but rather
[1:57:55.760 --> 1:58:00.040]  than yanking the tax status of the Clinton Foundation where the Clinton
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:04.480]  Foundation filings and their state filings and their federal filings are
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:09.040]  completely and totally permeated with fraud rather than going after the
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:12.560]  Clintons what's the IRS doing they're going after Donald Trump they're

[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:35.560]  had elites we've had boss hogs nobody's perfect but but the old elites wanted a
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:38.800]  prosperous country so they could skim more off the top nobody's perfect I'm
[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:42.320]  not you know an idiot but they still loved America they love their kids and
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:46.680]  their grandkids the elites we have now hate bitter clingers they hate men they

[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:55.440]  elite and the liberals that want to control speech I call them cult leaders

[2:02:11.440 --> 2:02:15.000]  are the Republicans that work with them well they're traders I think that's the
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:18.960]  that's the key word and the good news is look we've got them on the run I don't
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:22.760]  act like Harry Truman but here's one of the proudest moments of my life bush
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:28.800]  drops as field narrows we drove him out of this race why by exposing his
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:33.840]  families profiteering and their treason and he pledged to never quit never quit
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:37.520]  but but wasn't was the holy water and the giant silver cross and in high noon
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:41.560]  when Trump came out and said you let 9-11 happen you attacked the wrong
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:44.760]  country and I'm gonna release those pages and what he's really afraid of is the
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:50.360]  fact that there were 28 individual complaints or tips from Floridians
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:55.680]  about many of the hijackers training and preparing for their Florida in Tampa
[2:02:55.680 --> 2:02:59.200]  Florida so the Florida Department let him fly out they all left in Florida
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:02.720]  the bin Laden's all for the Florida yes the three days met they protected them
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:05.760]  of the state police and they took off they made their getaway under Bush's
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:10.760]  wings that makes jeb bush an accessory in the attack on 9-11 and he was
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:14.800]  afraid and this is all in my book but God was afraid that Donald Trump would go
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:23.120]  there look at that headline Trump insider Bush jeb Bush Bush's accessory on
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:27.160]  9-11 and it's true and it's sensational and we can destroy them they want to
[2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:30.840]  intimidate us all day let's get in the arena with Donald Trump that's why I
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:34.160]  admired on Trump I've been in the arena at a lesser level another danger you're

[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:50.000]  mine asked jeb bush about my book and he said Roger Stone's crazy boy they
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:53.440]  didn't think that I was crazy when they asked me to go to Miami-Dade in 2000
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:57.240]  take care of the recount for them which I did by the way greatest regard of my
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:00.280]  life I remember seeing you on TV I thought that he would actually be a
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:04.960]  compassionate conservative I have to admit until I began the research for my
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:09.560]  book on the Kennedy assassination I never really realized how evil the bushes
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:13.760]  were I knew that they were self-dealers I knew that they were crony capitalist I
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:17.600]  knew they weren't conservatives I'm from Connecticut I fought them back in the day
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:23.920]  I had no idea of the enormous scope of the theft and the evil people say to me
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:28.360]  how can you criticize George H.W. Bush he's a war hero really that's not what
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:33.040]  the guys on his plane say the way he punched out and let others die so he

[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:36.800]  than an orchestrated full-scale invasion of cultures AFP reports as of
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:43.720]  Tuesday morning 102,547 people had arrived in Greece while another
[2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:50.640]  7,507 had arrived in Italy since the beginning of the year last year the
[2:08:50.640 --> 2:08:56.560]  100,000 mark was only top during summer IOM spokesman Atayi Variri told
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.480]  reporters an estimated 35,000 migrants and refugees have reached the Greek
[2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:05.740]  Islands so far in February alone adding that nearly half of them were
[2:09:05.740 --> 2:09:11.600]  Syrians and a quarter were Afghanistan while another 17% were from Iraq once
[2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:16.680]  they reached Greece almost all attempt to move on he said adding that we
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:21.800]  understand that an estimated 26,000 have already passed the Greek border in
[2:09:21.800 --> 2:09:27.600]  February alone nearly 20,000 Afghans have arrived in Greece by sea so far this

[2:09:33.520 --> 2:09:38.760]  plummets into chaos Norway threatens to abandon the Geneva Convention and for
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:43.600]  good reason Kurt Nemo writes the failure of the borderless Schengen area scheme
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:48.600]  implemented by the European Union has prompted Norwegian Prime Minister Ernest
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:53.520]  Solberg to warn her country will abandon the Geneva Convention and close the
[2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:58.480]  border if Sweden collapses Solberg added the rejection of the EU Schengen area
[2:09:58.480 --> 2:10:02.240]  will be imposed in the event that it all breaks down that the flow of refugees
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:07.000]  just comes and they all end up in Norway because we're at the top of Europe
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:11.720]  Norway is the end point in October Swedish Foreign Minister Margo
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:15.360]  Wallström said the tidal wave of immigrants entering the country has
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:19.560]  destabilized the government and placed an immense burden on its socialist system
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:23.200]  in response the government has looked abroad to borrow money and is now
[2:10:23.200 --> 2:10:28.200]  considering hiking taxes on citizens to pay for the influx Wallström said I
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:33.080]  think most people feel that we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:38.480]  people will arrive every year in the long run our system will collapse but
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:42.920]  those voices have been muted as the clampdown on the public consensus in
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:47.600]  Europe is escalating our tea reports German police have reportedly launched
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:50.960]  an investigation into the cops who leaked internal reports of mass
[2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:55.200]  harassment and assaults on New Year's Eve and Cologne to the media the German
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:59.480]  press only learned about the outrageous sex attacks four days after the
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:03.600]  incidents Cologne police recently launched an investigation to find those
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:07.840]  who had spread the secret information without permission the authorities are
[2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:12.320]  determined to find out how internal police reports became public meanwhile
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:16.840]  back in the United States the Daily Caller reports the Obama administration
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:21.720]  will no longer ban immigrants with three sexually transmitted diseases and
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:25.840]  bacterial infections from entering the country according to the Center for
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:30.040]  Immigration Studies the Department of Health and Human Services announced the
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:35.840]  rule January 26th and it goes into effect on March 28th the Centers for

[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:46.560]  lympho granuloma vanarium from the list of inadmissible diseases for an
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:51.040]  immigrant seeking to enter the country the Obama administration estimates that
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:55.600]  the change would not cost more than a hundred million dollars in President
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:59.080]  Barack Obama's first year in office the Department of Health and Human Services
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:04.920]  decided that HIV was no longer a communicable disease of public health
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:10.880]  significance Obama's endangerment of the American people knows no bounds keeping
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:14.800]  tabs on the unyielding invasion of immigrants with the sole purpose of
[2:12:14.800 --> 2:12:18.840]  eliminating European culture and reducing the United States to a third
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:23.640]  world country has gradually become a distant talking point John Bown for

[2:12:54.440 --> 2:13:00.440]  people out of their trucks attacking them just crazy stuff and this is not
[2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:04.040]  your regular Muslim migrant folks these are people that invaded Syria most of
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:06.760]  them they got kicked out by the Russians now they're coming here
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:10.720]  plane loads come into the US they don't even check their IDs that's in the New
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:15.880]  York Daily News that's in the New York Post and no one gets in trouble and then
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:19.240]  Donald Trump says we have to stop people coming in till they at least vet them
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:24.080]  and then it's in the news no Obama won't even let governors know the names or the
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:29.000]  numbers that this is the suicide of the country the suicide of Europe Trump
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:32.240]  insider Roger Stone I want to get back into the Bush Crown family and recap
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:35.200]  what you were just breaking down and how big that is and then I want to go to
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:39.800]  phone calls but Donald Trump says the most common-sense stuff you can imagine
[2:13:39.800 --> 2:13:43.920]  and they turn it around and act like it's crazy yeah they try to say that it's
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:47.560]  so simple it's so simple when it is simple we need to seal our borders look
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:52.200]  what's happening in Cologne you've got these hordes of people raping killing
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:58.000]  taking over public facilities defecating in a child's pool raping people in the
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:03.320]  in the in the in the clubhouse in mass in mass this is what we have to look
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:07.760]  forward to in this country unless we secure our borders so the fact that
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:13.480]  Trump it wants to make America safe again not only great but safe again
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:17.680]  driving the establishment in the globalist crazy because they see the
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:21.320]  hordes that are coming here only Trump will stop this there's no American
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:25.040]  political figure and I hate it when Trump refers to himself as a politician
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:29.960]  he's he's the anti-politician he is not a politician he's a leader and he's
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:34.920]  leader American needs right now well he is the symbol now of nationalism one of
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:37.680]  the few things I think he just gets a little wrong is this whole Apple thing
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:41.280]  because the FBI is like can you just get this one phone for us well there isn't a
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:44.840]  program for that yet they can go to the phone company and get all the records in
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:49.000]  the ISP so I think it's it's I mean nobody's perfect I just think he's a
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:52.280]  little wrong on that he's right saying hey we know they're terrorists we know
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:56.760]  they did this break into the phone but they've misrepresented the FBI has what
[2:14:56.760 --> 2:15:00.320]  they're asking for my view well is Donald Trump perfect no he's not perfect I'm
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:04.720]  sure if I looked at it I'd find some areas that we disagree on but on the big
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:08.240]  picture issues the establishment is scared why does the sheet we have because
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:12.760]  he will refire and revitalize our economy he will rebuild our military he
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:16.960]  will seal our borders and we will finally have a foreign policy that makes
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:22.240]  sense we keep switching sides we end up facing down the the guns that we gave
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:27.080]  people or sold people incredible all he wants to do is restore common sense to
[2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:29.880]  government you got cut off by the break I want to go to phone calls again Roger
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:35.840]  Stone Stone's own calm I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com the phenomenon it's
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:38.560]  like being at the Grand Canyon seeing what's politically happening it's just
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:41.720]  epic it's so big it's so vast you can't believe you're seeing it it's like
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:45.400]  surreal this Trump phenomenon what's happening all over the world at the same
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:51.760]  time populism rising and the bizarre behavior of the left like cult leaders it
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:55.560]  is surreal for me and then getting back into the bushes how you were involved you
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:15:59.200]  know running the recount forum involved getting Herbert Walker elected you know
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:04.320]  inside Nixon inside Reagan looking back what would Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:08.920]  Nixon any of these men who would you say was probably the most patriotic best
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:12.920]  guy and then what do you think they would think of what's happening now if
[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:15.640]  Ronald Reagan were alive today he'd be rolling in his grave first of all I
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:19.440]  think he knew that George HW Bush was the single largest mistake he ever made
[2:16:19.440 --> 2:16:23.400]  well he said he's a globalist trilateralist and didn't want him and and what
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:26.920]  was his reward for picking Bush they tried to kill him and as I established
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:30.760]  in my book the many many ties between the assassination attempt on Ronald
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:34.360]  Reagan and the Bush family that whole that's got to scare them that you're
[2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:37.720]  such an insider saying all this let's say two things first of all Hinckley is
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:41.760]  not the only gunman secondarily there's more than five shots thirdly they've
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:47.680]  never turned over the photographs that were taken of the crime scene I went and
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:53.440]  obtained the actual photographs the uncropped photographs from presidential
[2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:57.400]  photographer Michael Evans look at the big picture you can see the second
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:01.240]  gunman you can see him on the balcony up above the door you can see the gun in
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:05.120]  his hand the five shots that's in your book it's so amazing the five shots that
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:09.280]  Hinckley squeezed off at Reagan are all accounted for none of them hit Ronald
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:12.480]  Reagan now of course Hinckley's family's meeting the day before with the Bush's
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:17.800]  and Colorado John Hinckley senior John Hinckley Jr.'s father is not only a
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:22.240]  former CIA operative along with George W. Bush but he's a major financier of
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:31.120]  Bush's political career in 1964 1966 1970 1980 he's described in the papers in
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:35.480]  the newspapers as a Reagan supporter never gave a dime to Ronald Reagan it's
[2:17:35.480 --> 2:17:38.920]  disinformation you knew Ronald Reagan very well and also Nixon I guess you were
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:42.600]  closer to Nixon though right I had a Nixon had a voracious interest in
[2:17:42.600 --> 2:17:46.200]  politics he was at the office he hung out with you we were very close friends
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:51.080]  he made a mean martini I must tell you the great thing about Nixon was he was
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:55.880]  not retrospective or introspective but after he had a drink and a half you
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:18:01.280]  could get him to talk about Alger Hiss Dwight Eisenhower Joe McCarthy believe
[2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:05.360]  me he knows who killed John Kennedy he's well aware that Lyndon Johnson killed
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:09.120]  John Kennedy what was it that Nixon said to me Lyndon and I both wanted to be
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:12.840]  president he said the difference was I wasn't willing to kill for it he knows
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:16.480]  exactly who killed John Kennedy Wow and that's directly you're well known be very
[2:18:16.480 --> 2:18:20.200]  good friends with a late Richard Nixon Nixon wasn't perfect but you look at the
[2:18:20.200 --> 2:18:24.240]  stuff he got in trouble for having a hundred and something names of IRS
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:28.120]  stuff not persecuting tens of thousands openly look he made major mistakes
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:32.520]  taking us off the gold standard major mistake the war on drugs major mistake
[2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:36.400]  but he did believe in American sovereignty he believed in America is that
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:40.200]  why there was an internal coup to just weaken the presidency at that time sure
[2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:45.360]  because you see the the the war machine the the internationalist thought that in
[2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:50.560]  the election of Nixon we would be able to prolong Vietnam war in order to make
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:54.360]  more money but he ended it they got a dove this guy was interested in peace and
[2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:58.960]  prosperity he was he was very cleverly playing the Russians the Chinese off
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:03.600]  against each other that's not what they expected they expected a dupe so he
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:06.880]  tried to be president that's why they got rid of he was a peacemaker that's why
[2:19:06.880 --> 2:19:10.160]  they got rid of now that's not to say well they don't want Trump because he'd
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:14.200]  actually try to be president and he and he believes in American sovereignty he's
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:16.720]  not prepared and that's why we're in so much trouble is we're gonna skip this
[2:19:16.720 --> 2:19:20.440]  break I can't help it that's why we're in so much trouble is that there's all
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:23.480]  these special interests who don't even have the same interest buying off chunks
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:27.120]  of everything as you said and so nothing seems to make sense or work because it
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:30.280]  only works for them to get more money but there won't be anywhere to spend the
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:33.680]  money if we have war with Russia where you rob the middle class and the poor
[2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:37.080]  people and everything collapses then all your money's worthless you morons
[2:19:37.080 --> 2:19:41.080]  exactly so political class are a bunch of idiots wait till Trump starts talking
[2:19:41.080 --> 2:19:44.680]  about monetary policy because he believes in a strong dollar he understands
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:49.240]  them the currency manipulation going on by the Chinese he would make a dollar as
[2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:53.480]  good as gold or some other commodity again let me ask you this question he's
[2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:57.600]  a Wharton graduate never think he doesn't understand the global and US economy
[2:19:57.600 --> 2:19:59.720]  and he's living in the real world big difference and had to put up with
[2:19:59.720 --> 2:20:02.400]  government regulations well and he's not the toast to Wall Street I'll tell you
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:06.640]  why he made his money on bricks and mortar and land he made his money in
[2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:11.960]  real estate tangible hard assets this is not a guy who played the stock market
[2:20:11.960 --> 2:20:15.680]  and by the way they put this lie out that either you know declared general
[2:20:15.680 --> 2:20:19.840]  bankruptcy when I used to make a film I get liability protection I make a
[2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:24.200]  corporation that's how you're supposed to do it I'd put it out and I never had
[2:20:24.200 --> 2:20:27.200]  to declare bankruptcy on that particular but I knew folks that did if it lost
[2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:30.160]  money I would just roll it up as I had contracts to folks that's what I had to
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:34.560]  do and shut it down and that projects bankrupt that's what every film in
[2:20:34.560 --> 2:20:38.040]  Hollywood does that's but see they know the general public hasn't actually
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:40.880]  worked in a bunch of businesses they don't know that Trump didn't declare
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:45.440]  general bankruptcy he didn't declare that article he did it specifically on
[2:20:45.440 --> 2:20:51.120]  projects that didn't work well and most specifically his casino empire which was
[2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:55.840]  destroyed by the state of New Jersey by government policy they have no airport
[2:20:55.840 --> 2:21:00.320]  there's no way to get there their policies destroyed his business so he
[2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:05.560]  used a legitimate business tactic he filed for chapter 11 to protect his
[2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:10.040]  employees to protect his business interests but the canard that Donald
[2:21:10.040 --> 2:21:14.760]  Trump personally filed for bankruptcy four times that's a an establishment lie
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:19.120]  promulgated again by Marco Rubio last night it's not general bankruptcy it's
[2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:23.720]  specific company yeah you know what I want a president that smart I want a
[2:21:23.720 --> 2:21:27.360]  president who will protect the American economy the way Donald Trump protected
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:31.400]  his businesses now the globalists admit they went clowered in heaven they won us
[2:21:31.400 --> 2:21:35.440]  poor like Obama said you can't have cars or air conditioning while he's on a
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:38.440]  jumbo jet these people are it'd be one thing if they were living in a shack
[2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:41.120]  saying we've all got to be poor for the earth I'm not gonna put up with these
[2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:45.600]  pigs telling me that these loving socialists I mean look what we've got
[2:21:45.600 --> 2:21:49.560]  it's amazing I want to go to phone calls here but finishing up on the bushes
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:54.440]  you're saying use the dynasty dead or or is it hanging on by its fingernails
[2:21:54.440 --> 2:21:58.000]  because the archetype of George Herbert Walker the former CIA director of the guy
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:01.080]  involved the Kennedy assassination out there looking like he didn't know what
[2:22:01.080 --> 2:22:05.160]  planet he was on I have respect for my elders but at the same time them rolling
[2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:09.960]  him out was that indicative of the dying bush dynasty the boy the bush about
[2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:13.240]  dynasty is far from dead these people if they are nothing else they're
[2:22:13.240 --> 2:22:18.800]  relentless look at it this way George HW Bush ran for vice president in 1968
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:27.320]  1972 1974 1976 and then he finally got there in 1980 now Alex no one runs for
[2:22:27.320 --> 2:22:31.400]  vice president no one other than Lyndon Johnson why did he run because he wanted
[2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:35.520]  to take over he had a plan that's why his right-hand man Bobby Baker says on
[2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:40.120]  the day John Kennedy is inaugurated what does he say John Kennedy will not fill
[2:22:40.120 --> 2:22:44.120]  out his term and he will die a violent death and the bushes sat at the knee of
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:48.160]  LBJ and the CIA and the opera right here in Austin Texas this is precisely why
[2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:53.040]  the bushes maneuvered relentlessly through the 60s and 70s and 80s for the
[2:22:53.040 --> 2:22:57.080]  vice president I actually know folks you know let's just say Johnson family some
[2:22:57.080 --> 2:22:59.600]  of the folks and that it's like a well-known of course we can't of course
[2:22:59.600 --> 2:23:03.040]  he was killed and I know some of the big Republicans and I've been on a plane
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:06.280]  with him before flying in out of Dallas there's like of course we killed that son
[2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:11.320]  of a bitch I mean they all brag about it well as you know the KGB conducted their
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:16.160]  own independent investigation J Griever says to Lyndon Johnson in a memo that
[2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:20.200]  was declassified in 1985 well mr. president the Soviets did their own
[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:24.520]  investigation you know what they concluded you did it you did it mr. president
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:27.560]  the French they did their own investigation at the request of Jackie
[2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:31.480]  Kennedy you know what they determined Lyndon Johnson did it sure the central
[2:23:31.480 --> 2:23:35.600]  intelligence agency is involved sure the mob was involved sure big Texas soil
[2:23:35.600 --> 2:23:39.360]  was involved so you always what's their common thread their common thread is
[2:23:39.360 --> 2:23:43.760]  Lyndon Baines Johnson he was the mastermind absolutely he was the
[2:23:43.760 --> 2:23:47.560]  indispensable I mean I've interviewed before she died it was on his his
[2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:52.960]  mistress yes you know they got over there at the at the cattleman's suite over
[2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:57.680]  at the Driscoll yes nice place to stay by the way and boy I tell you I mean he
[2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:00.440]  just walked right out and said after tomorrow that son of a bitch will never
[2:24:00.440 --> 2:24:03.320]  embarrass me again he said it to her twice actually said at the night before
[2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:08.000]  in the following morning he said after today those Irish mafia sons of bitches
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:13.720]  won't be down on me anymore so there's just no question remember in 1963
[2:24:13.720 --> 2:24:19.160]  in Texas murders a state crime who controls the Dallas police who controls
[2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:23.040]  the Dallas district attorney who has control of the investigation was just
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:27.200]  an open gangster he was Dixie mafia well he was on the pad for the mob he was
[2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:30.880]  being paid through a man named Jack Halfer who he pardoned immediately after
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:34.760]  becoming president he was my grandmother knew him he was a major
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:40.040]  water carrier for big Texas oil and as far as the CIA is concerned as the Senate
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:44.440]  majority leader he has the authority to appoint himself to a committee now the
[2:24:44.440 --> 2:24:48.400]  majority leader never serves on a committee the US Senate but Johnson
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:53.560]  appointed himself to the subcommittee of the of the defense appropriations
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:58.880]  committee that controlled the CIA budgets he's the paymaster for the CIA I
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:02.040]  want to go to calls but I got a question for you later all these top generals
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:05.960]  every special forces person I meet including officers they all say there's
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:08.960]  a counter coup in the government against Obama and the globalist takedown
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:13.520]  America they're all behind Trump they say he's for real that's got to scare the
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:17.400]  power structure that the guys that actually do the hanging are saying
[2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:21.120]  they're not gonna play ball was going after Trump or anybody I think that's
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:25.000]  exactly true that look they're losing their control that's why they're in a
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:30.600]  panic that that's why I'm being banned by CNN it's why I'm being banned by MSNBC
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:34.720]  both laughable because they very rarely interviewed me to begin with and their
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:40.680]  audiences are very small and because they know that the truth is dangerous to
[2:25:40.680 --> 2:25:45.080]  them look everything you need to know to defeat Hillary Clinton is in my book the
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:52.040]  epic rapes by Bill the cover-up by Hillary the Clintons abandoned son
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:55.840]  their African-American son who they threw away and I know how they work with the
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:59.720]  bushes you both books dovetail together I read them both are unbelievable pieces
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:03.680]  of history info wars store.com to get those because I'm an expert on all this
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:07.320]  stuff and I'd forgotten so much was in these books even learned more it's
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:10.880]  simply amazing and I even had family down here in Texas when a lot of this was
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:14.680]  going on that was involved in different agencies and things and they just say
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:18.520]  this stuff is dead on ladies and gentlemen all right info wars store.com
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:21.520]  I want to start going to calls I appreciate everybody holding Doug, Sean,
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:25.360]  Kristen, Alex, Tommy who should I go to first who's been holding the longest here
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:30.920]  Harmon all right Alex we're gonna go to Alex in California Alex you're on the
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:37.120]  here. Hi Alex how you doing? I'm just a little bit of background I'm a freelance
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:41.040]  writer and journalist reporter from the LA area in 2008 I covered a story that was
[2:26:41.040 --> 2:26:44.920]  featured in your police state film it was about the DUI checkpoint in San
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:49.040]  Bernardino that they did with their marines were there so I just want to
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:52.000]  say you know I believe a lot of what you're saying I really do. You're the
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.360]  journalist I had on about the marines running the arm checkpoints in
[2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:58.320]  California is that what you're saying? Yeah in 2000 it was. I remember you how are you
[2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:01.320]  doing? I remember your voice. Sure so what's your question or comment for
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:05.600]  Stone? Well I have a question and comment kind of first I just want to say to
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:08.280]  Roger Stone you know even though I believe a lot of what you guys are saying
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:12.800]  about Trump there's a couple things I find problematic and I really wanted it
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:19.320]  to get your opinion. There's a lot of talk on social media just around a lot of
[2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:22.720]  people that you know a lot of these racist groups like KKK and you're not
[2:27:22.720 --> 2:27:26.520]  scoops the West Coast groups are run by those people are run by the Democratic
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:30.000]  Party and always have been. It's come out every time they're run by the feds. There
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:34.520]  isn't one Nazi group out there that didn't chaired and run by one of these
[2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:37.880]  people in the government. It's a total dialectic just like George Soros
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:41.680]  finances Black Lives Matter. The very same foundations run the white
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:44.960]  supremacists. That's why you go to white supremacist websites they hate me more
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:48.960]  than Benjamin Yahu. I'm sorry I'm ranting you want to comment on that? Go ahead
[2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:53.760]  do it go ahead with your question. No I agree I just wondering will Trump ever
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:59.400]  you know respond to this because I think... Why should he? It's like responding to
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:04.120]  dog crap. They're being used to discredit him. This is an old trick so you saw a
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:08.240]  big story. David Duke endorses Donald Trump. Let me tell you something. Donald
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:11.840]  Trump doesn't endorse David Duke. That's a canard. It's an attempt to
[2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:16.840]  destabilize Trump. Donald Trump is not a racist. He is not a... He's the guy that
[2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:21.360]  buys the famous golf courses that are white only and opens it up. And formed a
[2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:25.400]  club in Palm Beach to admit Jews because the big clubs wouldn't admit. He's a
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:30.120]  rebel folks. I've been studying it. And he has created thousands of jobs for
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:34.620]  black people. Thousands of jobs for Hispanics. Donald Trump stands for
[2:28:34.620 --> 2:28:38.280]  opportunity. He stands for press... Listen I haven't found a white
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:42.520]  supremacist group that's on TV that isn't run by the feds. I mean I mean
[2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:45.560]  literally I've gone out in protest to them and it looks like an ADL meeting. I
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:50.240]  mean if those guys are Nazis up on stage I'm an Easter Bunny. I mean I'm sorry
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:54.160]  it's totally fake. It's a dirty trick folks. But thanks for your question. You
[2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:59.360]  got a comment. Go ahead. No I mean I was just saying you know I take that into
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:03.040]  account what you're saying but I just feel like you know I feel like Trump
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:05.880]  would be better if he addressed this and kind of made a public that he wasn't
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:09.120]  because I feel like for the most part people don't hear that from him. Even
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:12.320]  though it may be true. No I hear you. Here's the deal. Then there'll be more
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:15.440]  groups that come out and say you know then a child molester group, financial
[2:29:15.440 --> 2:29:18.160]  Democrats will come out. You don't have to say I'm not for child molesters. It's a
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:21.200]  tactic. He just needs to be confident and move forward. But I hear your point.
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:26.120]  Here's the bottom line Alex. The power structure is literally crapping their
[2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:29.320]  diapers over Donald Trump. I hate to be gross but that's the allegory. That's
[2:29:29.320 --> 2:29:34.120]  why they're so scared. And he's taught about 9-11 Truth. Audit the Federal
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:38.040]  Reserve. Don't make corporations be tax exempt. Have national sovereignty.
[2:29:38.040 --> 2:29:42.640]  Anti-globalism. Don't have one with Russia. Don't fund and run ISIS. On and on
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:46.280]  and on. Cut taxes on poor people. Make the hedge fund operators pay their
[2:29:46.280 --> 2:29:50.360]  absolutely. We'll be back with more calls with Roger Stone. The Empire's on the
[2:29:50.360 --> 2:29:56.280]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.080 --> 2:30:03.200]  Someone on Twitter asks, hey if you're so against the left-right paradigm then
[2:30:03.200 --> 2:30:05.880]  why do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie
[2:30:05.880 --> 2:30:10.480]  Sanders? Listen, the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class. You've got
[2:30:10.480 --> 2:30:14.120]  to loot the middle class because that's where the money is. According to the tax
[2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:18.920]  policy center and the tax foundation, the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on
[2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:24.040]  most Americans. It's a very big tax increase for everyone except those at
[2:30:24.040 --> 2:30:27.880]  the bottom. Everybody loves to get free stuff and politicians are always
[2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:30.520]  pitching the idea that the poor and middle class are going to get the
[2:30:30.520 --> 2:30:34.440]  benefits and the rich will pay for it. Americans received more than two
[2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:39.360]  trillion dollars in benefits from the federal government in 2014. Bernie wants
[2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:42.920]  to hike that amount exponentially. The question is where's the money going to
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:46.680]  come from after the middle class and the millionaires have been looted and the
[2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:51.320]  mega-rich flee the country? To find out in detail how the Sanders tax plan will
[2:30:51.320 --> 2:30:56.200]  destroy the middle class, visit infowars.com.

[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:45.480]  infowarsleif.com. By the way, I was trying to mention all the incredibly
[2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:52.560]  patriotic, nationalistic, just brave things Trump's doing. He says, hey, if I get
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:57.680]  elected, I will prosecute Hillary Clinton. I mean, you talk about asking for it. I
[2:34:57.680 --> 2:35:02.000]  guess he just knows he's risking his life. And so he's going all out. I mean, get
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  us inside Trump's mind and then want to go to some more calls here and we have a
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:09.600]  guest popping in. Can you imagine any other conventional political figure, any
[2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:14.360]  career politician having the courage to say that? I mean, Hillary Clinton can be
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:19.040]  prosecuted for unmultiple crimes. There is no question, first of all, that one
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:23.480]  does not even have to prove intent. There can be criminal negligence in her
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:28.440]  misuse of top secret documents. The evidence is overwhelming. There's no
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:34.040]  there's no lack of evidence of guilt. And then that's before you even touch the
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:37.760]  Clinton Foundation, before you even can touch the fact that the Clinton
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:42.720]  Foundation is a $2 billion global fraud. It is a vehicle for the
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:47.600]  facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes. And here's the best part. You
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:51.200]  know who's legally culpable? You know who signed all those fraudulent reports?
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:57.560]  Chelsea Clinton. She can warm her jail cell up too. Wow. And again, you've been
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:36:01.240]  the consulate insider, but always promoted kind of very goldwater libertarian
[2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:04.880]  ideas since you got in on your fan of goldwater. You finally just broke one
[2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:10.360]  the system. When was the moment that you became such a resistor? I mean, just
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:14.960]  putting out the most hardcore books and material about the power structure ever.
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:19.400]  The Iraq war was what did it for me. See, until then, I didn't really understand
[2:36:19.400 --> 2:36:24.200]  the big picture. And once it became clear to me that we were rushing to war on
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:27.960]  false pretenses, I realized that the mistake of George W. Bush was an
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:32.440]  enormous mistake. And I had to atone for it in some way. And that's when I started
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:35.360]  talking about what I'd seen and what I'd heard. And I began putting the big
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:40.840]  picture together. And look, I don't regret anything that I've written. And I
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:45.320]  intend to write more. I'm going to continue to pursue this. I started two
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:50.560]  years ago with the idea that we were going to be facing a Bush Clinton
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:55.160]  choice, which is kind of a heads I win tails you lose election and that that
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:36:59.160]  had to be blunted. And the only guy who could do it, the only guy with the name
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:05.120]  ID and the stature and the gravitas and frankly, the guts, the courage to do it
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:09.840]  was Donald Trump. Now, last night in the debate, a great deal was made in the fact
[2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:15.480]  that Trump gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. In all honesty, he thought he
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:18.360]  was giving to a charity. He didn't know they were going to steal the money. But
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:21.240]  think about plus that was years ago and he was in New York, even better.
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:25.800]  Therefore, he has the standing to sue them for fraud and use the lawsuit this
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:30.480]  fall to open up the entire Clinton. Wow. Nation. That's a strange folks, not a
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:34.920]  weakness. He was defrauded. He's not happy about it. He thought he was helping
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:37.880]  poor children abroad. He didn't know that they were going to he thought he was
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:41.200]  helping kids in Haiti. He didn't know that they were going to steal the money.
[2:37:41.200 --> 2:37:45.640]  So his support for the Clinton Foundation, however, motivated. Well, that's
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:48.800]  one thing about Trump though. He wouldn't tell people he's being audited until they
[2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:52.240]  brought it up like he'd done something bad. He's being persecuted. He wouldn't
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:55.840]  bring up. But I know it's leaked out that he gives a lot to charity and then
[2:37:55.840 --> 2:37:59.960]  never talks about it. He has helped people of not only through charities, but
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:03.920]  individual pieces. Everybody knows the story about his limousine breaking down
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:08.200]  on the on the side of the road. Some folks pull over to help him. They help him
[2:38:08.200 --> 2:38:11.320]  get to the next stop. The next day he finds out who they are and he pays their
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:15.960]  mortgage off. That's Donald Trump. This is a guy who cares about working people.
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:20.360]  Also, there's watching on TV shows and stuff. He came off kind of as fake. But
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:24.680]  then when I see him with those crowds and those people, he is really responding
[2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:28.560]  to it. And really, you can tell almost as tears in his eyes. So I think we're
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:32.360]  seeing a metamorphosis of Trump to even before years. But is he not accelerating
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:36.480]  his development right now? This is a man who has never had a cigarette, who has
[2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:41.760]  never had a drink, who's never touched any drugs. So he's spartan in that sense.
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:45.920]  He does. Wow. Donald Trump doesn't drink. Not a drop. Never had a drop in his
[2:38:45.920 --> 2:38:51.320]  entire life. Doesn't believe in it. Encourages children not to drink. He is
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:38:55.680]  someone who in all honesty, he doesn't enjoy the company of billionaires. He
[2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:59.560]  doesn't like hanging out with the hot shots. I'll tell you what he does like. He
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:03.120]  likes a good cheeseburger. He likes hanging out with working people. He
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:07.520]  likes regular people. He relates more to blue-collar workers than he does the
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:10.640]  members of his own high-class. That's what folks have said. It's ever from the
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:13.160]  campaign that it works in the buildings and on sites. They say drinks are
[2:39:13.160 --> 2:39:17.000]  really good. And he's funny. He's entertainment. He's fun to be with. I like
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:21.360]  the fact that he makes those those risqué jokes. He's being real. You know
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:26.240]  what? He likes, he likes, he likes a beautiful woman. He likes women. He is,
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:30.520]  he's a devoted family man. No, no, he's a devoted family man. His wife, by the way,
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:34.440]  is a wonderful woman. She did really good on TV. Cultured. Intelligence. Speaks
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:37.640]  five languages. We'll go a couple more calls because we've got, we're gonna go to your
[2:39:37.640 --> 2:39:41.040]  calls after Robert Perry. I wanted to get Robert Perry to pop in. He's on there
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:44.480]  with Roger Stone and Alex Jones. It's a total Donald Trump love fest right now.
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:47.960]  And I'll tell you why. He's in the arena. He's doing stuff nobody's ever done. But
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:51.200]  we're about to go to him in a moment. First, Joe Biggs. Joe Biggs, one of our
[2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:54.920]  reporters, had a question for you before we go to Mr. Perry on the Russia
[2:39:54.920 --> 2:39:58.600]  situation. That ties into Trump as well. Russia reportedly threatening to use
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:02.440]  tactical nukes against Saudi Arabia or Turkey if they send in a huge ground
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:05.800]  invasion. Notice as soon as that came out, they've got a peace deal going, but
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:09.200]  we'll talk to Mr. Perry. I appreciate joining us here just a moment. Joe Biggs,
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:13.040]  what's your question? All right, it's for Mr. Stone. I was kind of curious. Today
[2:40:13.040 --> 2:40:16.560]  it's all over the news right now that Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:20.840]  come out and endorsed Donald Trump. Do you think this is a good thing for
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:25.480]  Donald or not? I actually think it is a good thing. I know that the Rubio people
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:30.160]  with an assist from the Bushes were trying desperately to get his support.
[2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:33.960]  But I would point out to you that Chris Christie is a very close friend of
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:38.320]  Marianne Trump Berry, who's a very distinguished federal judge, Donald's
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:44.000]  sister, one of the finest women that I have ever known. And the Christie
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:50.760]  endorsement of Trump is a chink in the in the armor of the establishment of
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:54.280]  Trump. I'm glad to have his support because we're going to a convention that
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:58.320]  is going to be a vicious fight. This is why I'm trying to recruit the best
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:02.080]  parliamentarians, the best floor operatives. I've been to every Republican
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:06.840]  National Convention since 1964. I have worked the floor in the conventions in
[2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:14.080]  72, 76, 80, 84, 88. So I know my way around the convention floor. They have the
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:18.480]  troops. They have the experts. That's why I've got to go to my Rolodex. I've got to
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:21.880]  recruit people who've been out of the system for a while, but know these rules
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:25.280]  even better than I do. I've got to find a place to house them. I'll get no
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:29.200]  cooperation from the Republican National Committee. There'll be no hotel rooms in
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:33.920]  Cleveland for the Trumpites that I can assure you. That's why I set up
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:38.000]  StopToSteal.org. I got to raise a little bit of money to pull some of the
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:41.880]  conservative activists, some of the real pioneers. I think you can probably recruit
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:45.880]  Buchanan. I have no doubt about that. Pat Buchanan is a friend of mine going
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:49.440]  back to the Nixon days. He's a real patriot, and I have no doubt that he
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:53.680]  will be on the front lines. All right. Good question, Beggs. We'll have you
[2:41:53.680 --> 2:41:56.640]  popping in also in the fourth hour today. And of course, not me, News Tonight 7.
[2:41:56.640 --> 2:41:59.480]  And I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central. We're going to cover your
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:02.160]  speech tomorrow at Brave New Books. And we're going to have excerpts of that
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:06.960]  Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. I want to go to our guests. I appreciate coming on the
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:12.080]  broadcast today. I want to go over several issues with him. Here's the
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:15.680]  article. Paul Joseph Watson wrote about it and the report written for
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:20.000]  Consortium News. And of course, Robert Parry is the editor of Consortium
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:25.120]  News.com. And he has worked with Press TV, Newsweek, PBS Frontline, Bloomberg
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:30.200]  News, you name it. And he's an author and investigative journalist. And he
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:34.440]  reportedly has talked to some of the Russian insiders about their strategy
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:40.840]  in Syria and how serious this has gotten with Turkey still shelling, even as
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:44.520]  Russia tries to make a peace deal with the U.S. brokering it, Saudi Arabia
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:48.040]  threatening to launch a ground war. And Russia made this threat reportedly two
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:52.440]  days after Saudi ministers said we now have nukes from Pakistan. We're ready to
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:55.040]  use them. So if the Saudis are crazy enough to start a nuclear war with
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:42:59.760]  Russia, somebody needs to stop them. But of course, Ms. Parry also helped
[2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:03.200]  expose Iran-Contra and a lot more. She's been an investigative journalist for a
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:07.400]  long time. Robert, thanks for coming on. You're with Roger Stone, former head of
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:10.320]  the Trump campaign, who obviously Trump is against war with Russia and what's
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:13.920]  happening in Syria. So we appreciate you coming on. What did this Russian
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:18.000]  insider specifically tell you? And what's changed since a week ago with the
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:21.440]  Russians wanting a peace deal? Is that because they're concerned about Saudi
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:25.640]  Arabia? Well, thanks, Alex. Thanks for having me. It's good to hear, Roger, too.
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:33.080]  Well, basically, the source who was close to Putin told me at this point
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:36.920]  when things were at a crisis stage, Turkey had been threatening to do a
[2:43:36.920 --> 2:43:43.400]  full-scale invasion of Syria. The Saudis were also eager to go in and
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:49.400]  join them. They wanted the United States to be part of this invasion. And the
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:54.600]  Russians have, according to the source, about 20,000 total personnel. Some are
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:43:59.000]  front-line troops and some are support people. And so the Russians were facing
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  the possibility of annihilation of those people. And even though it's a
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:09.200]  violation somewhat of their general idea of when they would use nuclear
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:14.560]  weapons, I was told by the source that Putin made it clear to the Turks that if
[2:44:14.560 --> 2:44:20.080]  they, if these 20,000 or so Russians were about to be annihilated, that the
[2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:23.760]  Russians were prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons to stop this
[2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:32.440]  invasion. Now, shortly after that, President Obama apparently was
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:36.520]  persuasive enough with the Turks and the Saudis to at least calm them down. He
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:41.360]  didn't flatly forbid them from invading, I was told, but he made it clear the
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:46.920]  United States would not join them. And that created some space for
[2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:53.000]  Secretary of State Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov to hammer out this
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:56.960]  partial ceasefire that's supposed to go into effect tomorrow or over the
[2:44:56.960 --> 2:45:00.880]  weekend. Well, obviously you've broke a lot of big stories over the years. You've
[2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:05.480]  got a lot of credibility. But right after you put this out, and we have a
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:09.160]  Saudi threatening to use nukes, which is unprecedented, meaning they have them, and
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:13.120]  all this to then see suddenly a brokerage deal happening, shows just how
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:18.800]  serious, how close to midnight we've gotten and shows how dangerous this
[2:45:18.800 --> 2:45:24.400]  situation is. Russia with total sanctions now on Turkey. And Russia, more
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:27.600]  credibility to what you're saying, because the Saudis have already said it, is
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:32.200]  remember 888 when the West basically went into Georgia, went all the way up to
[2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:36.840]  South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and killed all those Russian troops in that
[2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:40.920]  demilitarized zone at the UN base, the Russians came in with medium-range nukes
[2:45:40.920 --> 2:45:44.960]  and said we'll use them if NATO doesn't pull out a NATO did. Dick Cheney
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:49.360]  blinked. So it shows the insane brinksmanship, and Obama to a great extent
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:54.240]  is being advised by the neocons. And these people are insane, and none of them
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:57.400]  have been in the military. And it's our military that continues, and I have a
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:46:01.480]  Colonel Schaefer on, years before Sauer Hirsch came on and said, General Dempsey
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:04.520]  told Obama three years ago, you're not sitting ground troops in and we're not
[2:46:04.520 --> 2:46:08.560]  bombing for al-Qaeda. So again, there's this not mutiny, because we have a
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:13.040]  globalist mutiny over America. We have the military never before in US history at
[2:46:13.040 --> 2:46:16.120]  this level actually holding back the neocons. I want you to comment on that
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:20.480]  Robert Parry of QuiktorciumNews.com. But first, Mr. Stone, your take on what I
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:24.320]  just said. Well, first of all, let me say I'm a, I followed Robert's career for many
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:27.880]  years, and I'm a big fan of the incredibly seminal work you did on
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:33.480]  Iran-Contra, really first rate. And I'm delighted to be with you today. I think
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:38.520]  that if you look at all these foreign countries, many of them fear the rise of
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:43.200]  Trump, because now you finally have a world leader who is unbought and
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:49.240]  unbossed, whose only, only responsibility would be to the American people.
[2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:52.920]  And who doesn't want nuclear war? And who does not want nuclear war. Even last
[2:46:52.920 --> 2:46:56.440]  night, his comments about the Middle East shows that he is dedicated to peace.
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:47:00.880]  Donald Trump understands that the only people who benefit from war are the
[2:47:00.880 --> 2:47:05.320]  munitions manufacturers. So I think- And the munitions are too big now. We have to
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:09.400]  stop that business. The political class is petrified about an American
[2:47:09.400 --> 2:47:16.080]  president who puts America first and who's a fundamental principle of
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:20.760]  foreign policy would be simple. Is it in the interests of the United States?
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:26.080]  Absolutely, Mr. Parry. In that sense, as Roger points out, Trump is really sort of
[2:47:26.080 --> 2:47:32.520]  a realist. And realists have become an endangered species in Washington, where
[2:47:32.520 --> 2:47:36.200]  the neoconservatives and the liberal interventionist sidekicks that they
[2:47:36.200 --> 2:47:42.080]  have have essentially taken over the establishment on foreign policy. And so
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:45.640]  the old realists who did exactly as Roger said, they always weighed
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:48.840]  American interest against getting involved. This goes back really to the
[2:47:48.840 --> 2:47:52.560]  beginning of the country when Washington and Adams and Jefferson said,
[2:47:52.560 --> 2:47:57.200]  avoid foreign entanglements. That's right. And John Quincy Adams said,
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:01.680]  it's not our job to go search for the world for monsters. That's sort of been
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:05.880]  lost. Yeah, we now do the opposite of that. That's all we do. Yeah, and make
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:09.640]  no mistake. We recognize people. And we have to pick up on Roger's point, pick up
[2:48:09.640 --> 2:48:13.480]  on Roger's point that there is now an hysteria going on. If you read the
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:18.080]  Washington Post, which is now dominated by neoconservative writers, their op-ed
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:22.480]  pages, their editorial page and op-ed pages are pretty heavily neoconservative.
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:26.520]  There are a few token liberals here or there, but mostly neoconservatives. And
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:31.440]  so you have this hysteria going on that what will Trump do? And I think they are
[2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:35.640]  afraid that he will shatter the establishment as we've seen it for a
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:40.400]  number of years now and possibly bring back some of this more practical,
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:44.160]  pragmatic thinking about American foreign policy. And that really scares them
[2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:47.600]  with a lot of libertarians, a lot of real liberals, a lot of professors, even
[2:48:47.600 --> 2:48:52.440]  Code Pink is liking him now. Because who wants nuclear war, Roger? No, you make it
[2:48:52.440 --> 2:48:55.960]  and you make a very good point. Look, the Washington Post is literally the single
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:49:00.640]  worst newspaper in the United States. The infiltration of the Washington Post by
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:06.040]  the Central Intelligence Agency goes back goes back to the 60s. I have a
[2:49:06.040 --> 2:49:12.440]  5,000 word monograph coming shortly on Bob Woodward, which completely exposes
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:17.520]  him as the fraud and the liar that he is. You'll be able to buy that at Amazon
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:21.560]  dot com in about two weeks. I put a lot of work into this, but people need to
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:25.760]  realize that nothing Bob Woodward reports is the truth. Total operative.
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:30.480]  Literally nothing. Who commands him today, though? We know it was Naval Intelligence
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:34.440]  and CIA to take down Nixon, but because they wanted to cover up the Kennedy
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:38.280]  thing. Who runs it now? I think today does it for the money, to be
[2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:43.200]  all honesty. I think he's in it for the money. But this guy has a very, very
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:48.160]  tenuous relationship with the truth and he needs to be a completely unmasked.
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:53.200]  This is a guy who claimed that he snuck into Bill Casey's hotel room and then
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:57.120]  Bill Casey, the former CIA director, confessed everything about Iran Contra. I
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:01.320]  knew Bill Casey. I know his wife Bernadette. I know his children. I know his
[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:06.480]  daughter. At that point, Bill Casey could no longer speak. It's a lie. It's a
[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:14.160]  complete lie. Wow. I tell you, this is just epic radio today. Mr. Pahri, I want to
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:18.000]  apologize too today that I kind of cut your time short. I really appreciate you
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:21.760]  joining us. Can I get you back on for a full 30 minutes or an hour next week?
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:25.800]  Sure, Alex. I'll be around. Well, you just do a great job at Consortium News.
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:28.640]  Everybody needs to visit it. ConsortiumNews.com. I'm going to put you on the
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:31.760]  phone with Nico and set you up for a full 30 minutes or hour, whatever you'd like
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:36.080]  to do next week. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you. Yeah, he breaks really big
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:39.800]  news. And of course, thank God we didn't have nuclear war last week, but it's just
[2:50:39.800 --> 2:50:43.440]  these neocons will kill us all if we let them continue to control things. And they
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:45.920]  run the Democrats as well, to a great extent. We're going to come back with two
[2:50:45.920 --> 2:50:49.560]  segments of Roger Stone. I promise go to your phone calls. Sean, you're up next.

[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:11.720]  exhaust this guy, but I may take him right into the third hour with David Knight.
[2:54:11.720 --> 2:54:14.840]  So, David's got some questions. I'll have you out here about 15 after we get that
[2:54:14.840 --> 2:54:17.480]  good German-Texas barbecue we got back there waiting right now.
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:23.960]  German recipes, but cooked over there at VIX by great Mexican folks. It is about as
[2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:28.200]  good as it gets, so I'm going to be, there's a plug for VIX. But we're going to be
[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:31.640]  going 15 minutes to the next hour and I want to go to your calls. I appreciate
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:36.680]  you holding. You were making a wonderful, wonderful point of hypocrisy when I was
[2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:39.240]  talking about how we have the number one story on the internet according to
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:43.960]  Google Analytics for a day with the New York Times writer calls for assassination
[2:54:43.960 --> 2:54:46.680]  of Trump. And then you pointed out something about that guy I forgot about.
[2:54:46.680 --> 2:54:50.760]  Well, there's this fellow named Wilson who is a faux political consultant out of
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:55.640]  Tallahassee, Florida. This guy goes on Twitter and he calls for someone to put
[2:54:55.640 --> 2:55:01.080]  a bullet in Donald Trump. He also accuses on Twitter, he accuses my friend
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:07.080]  Ann Coulter of having anal sex with Donald Trump. He's still on CNN, but I've been
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:11.720]  banned because what I said about in a Navarro, as dumb as dog poo,
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:16.360]  dumber, is offensive. That's offensive. Just goes to show you the double standard
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:19.880]  there. CNN had three guests on there, Buzz Bissinger,
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:24.280]  Pierce Morgan, and the ambassador's daughter, whatever that girl's name is,
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:28.200]  saying, let's kill Alex. Let's dress up in uniforms. He needs to be murdered.
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:32.040]  Let's killing. And it's all cute and funny. What is their problem? If I said that,
[2:55:32.040 --> 2:55:36.760]  I'd be arrested. This is Soviet style censorship. They fear what we know.
[2:55:36.760 --> 2:55:42.760]  They fear what we have to say. They fear the fact that they can no longer contain
[2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:46.760]  the truth about the Clintons and their various crimes. They can no longer
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:50.280]  contain the truth about the Bushes and how the Bushes and the Clintons are in it
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:54.200]  together. Don't they get that Trump is a manifestation of focal point of the anger?
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:57.880]  It's not going away. They ought to just run out the white flag and run to a foreign
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:00.600]  country immediately. Look, there's two people I want to thank. First of all,
[2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:04.600]  I want to thank the Pope from the bottom of my heart. He really helped propel
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:08.760]  Donald Trump and now Vicente Fox to a massive victory. And then Vicente Fox,
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:11.400]  he and his brother have been heavily involved in the drug trade. But I want
[2:56:11.400 --> 2:56:16.040]  to thank him also because all they're helping do is make Americans realize
[2:56:16.040 --> 2:56:19.320]  that only Trump, the guy they're vicious, that we're run by a bunch of foreigners
[2:56:19.320 --> 2:56:24.040]  that were chumps. We're being colonialized by every crook and scumbag out there.
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:28.600]  Well said. Wow. Let's go to Sean in Florida. You're on the air along the same line. Go ahead.
[2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:33.560]  Hey, guys, how you doing? I'm actually calling from Clearwater, Florida,
[2:56:33.560 --> 2:56:38.840]  right where the guys were trained at PIE Airport while on Rubio's watch. But
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:43.960]  I was kind of assessing the same thing and thinking to myself, why would Rubio be
[2:56:43.960 --> 2:56:47.400]  running for second place, obviously, to get to a broker convention? But
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:50.680]  if I understand the three options that they have at a broker convention,
[2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:56.920]  all three of those will lead to probably civil revolution. So I'm wondering,
[2:56:56.920 --> 2:57:02.360]  do you guys think that somebody would actually take a chance too often? I know that they've
[2:57:02.360 --> 2:57:07.160]  kind of heightened. Oh, I guarantee you the Clinton Club and others are sitting around
[2:57:07.160 --> 2:57:11.960]  right now. By the way, Trump came out in Questions Scalia. Now he learns the secret society.
[2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:15.800]  I guarantee you they are thinking about how to get away with it. Mr. Stone?
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:21.720]  Well, I've been encouraged not to talk about Trump's security. He has very, very good people
[2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:26.600]  around him. Believe me, he doesn't completely trust just his protection of the Secret Service.
[2:57:26.600 --> 2:57:31.560]  He has his own security detail and they're the very best. But Trump is a courageous man.
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:35.720]  He's a bold guy. He knows that this is dangerous. He knows he's taking his life in his hands.
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:40.440]  He loves his country. He's ready to do something about it. Here, of course, is the real point.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:44.520]  If they wrenched the nomination from Trump through some phony,
[2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:49.080]  brokered convention, and they managed to deliver the nomination to a Marco Rubio,
[2:57:49.080 --> 2:57:52.920]  who really is just carrying the Bush agenda in a more attractive package,
[2:57:52.920 --> 2:57:57.800]  or they delivered it to Mitt Romney, of course, they would destroy the value of the Republican
[2:57:57.800 --> 2:58:02.280]  nomination. Of course, they would lose the general election. But that's perfectly all right with them
[2:58:02.280 --> 2:58:07.640]  because the Republican establishment would be more comfortable with the Hillary Clinton presidency
[2:58:07.640 --> 2:58:11.720]  than they would be with the... That's why we've heard that from Glenn Beck, that mental patient.
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:15.720]  I'm sorry. So we've heard it from Glenn Beck. That's why we've heard it from Carl Rove. We've
[2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:19.560]  heard it from all of them that Hillary's better. These people are traitors. There's no question about
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:23.720]  it. By the way, what's wrong? I don't want to bash him, but what is wrong with Glenn Beck?
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:28.200]  I mean, he literally sounds like a fruit loop these days. He seems to be in the enthrall
[2:58:28.200 --> 2:58:33.080]  of Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz is, of course, a globalist. His wife's a member of the Council on Foreign
[2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:37.960]  Relief. Stay there, sir. Back in 70 seconds with Doug, Kristen, Chris, Tommy, and others.
[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:41.240]  And then I'm just going to keep this guy in here as long as I can. David Knight's coming
[2:58:41.240 --> 2:58:44.520]  up out of the other studio in the fourth hour. We're going to let David get a few questions in.

[3:00:44.600 --> 3:00:46.600]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:52.600]  Yeah, how are you doing today, Alex? I just wanted to tell you, you and your crew are smashing things here the past few weeks.
[3:00:52.600 --> 3:01:02.600]  And Roger Stone, thank God you are who you are. I had one question and two really, really vital suggestions as far as starting with the campaign.
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:12.600]  The question from Mr. Stone is this, when are we going to see a full unveiling as what would help appease the Cheshire staff search in Biggs?
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:20.600]  When are we going to actually see the unveiling of Trump's financial plan for the economy since it is the number one issue regarding national security?
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:24.600]  And I mean, we as the people, I mean, that's what we're starving to hear right now is how we're going to...
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:32.600]  There's about seven of a plan. He knows they're going to attack it, but Biggs kept saying, Trump, Trump, Trump doesn't need a wall. We need a plan.
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:36.600]  And I get that. I think we've seen more of a plan now. Go after the establishment.
[3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:40.600]  You know, don't let them have one-sided trade deals. That right there. Cut taxes. That's a huge plan.
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:48.600]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50% in one of the major areas, 30% in another, and the receipts of the government almost doubled.
[3:01:48.600 --> 3:01:53.600]  So the system knows cutting taxes brings in money. They just want to control everything. But what is Trump's plan overall?
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:02:01.600]  Trump actually has introduced a very detailed plan. You can find it online. It's been praised by the supply side economist Larry Kudlow,
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:05.600]  who is very close associate of Ronald Reagan, and he'll put together his tax plan.
[3:02:05.600 --> 3:02:12.600]  It has several parts. Let's go through them. The most important one is, Trump would cut the corporate tax rate below that of China.
[3:02:12.600 --> 3:02:20.600]  So China, our current corporate tax rate is 35. China is 25. Cut America's rate to 15.
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:27.600]  And that makes the money come back. Overnight. All those giant companies doing business in China because it's more profitable.
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:32.600]  And the globalists wrote that to ship our jobs overseas. Right. So they come back to the United States. They bring jobs back with them.
[3:02:32.600 --> 3:02:36.600]  They expand here. They hire here. They create opportunity here.
[3:02:36.600 --> 3:02:45.600]  Secondarily, the whole question of inversion. There's two trillion dollars offshore that's avoiding taxation.
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:50.600]  Trump would bring that money back into the country. And at DonaldJTrump.com, we're showing it's all there.
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:53.600]  They keep saying there's no plan. There really is a plan. There's an extraordinary plan.
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:03:03.600]  And then step three, Trump understands that currently in the federal bank accounts, there is one trillion dollars that is unaccounted for.
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:12.600]  Now, every administration prior to Obama has swept those funds into the general to be used instead of going for a higher taxes.
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:19.600]  Yet those funds sit there. Senator Coburn, the former senator from Oklahoma, great patriot, has talked and written about this at length.
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:25.600]  Trump would go sweep that trillion dollars back into the national economy, back into the federal coffers.
[3:03:25.600 --> 3:03:32.600]  So instead of raising taxes on working people, we can use money that's already on hand and unbudgeted for.
[3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:37.600]  Trump has a very dynamic plan that would make this economy cook.
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:47.600]  You know what I told him? They're going to call it the Trump boom, the biggest expansion in American economic history under a guy who's a Wharton graduate.
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:54.600]  I'll tell you, my concern is that Roger is that they're going to let him get in, they're holding the economy up, it implodes.
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:04:00.600]  Then they claim like smooth haulings that protectionism caused the new depression. When the new depression is already here, that's my big concern.
[3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:08.600]  I'm not sure that Trump would ever really enact the tariffs. I think he's using as a big old stick against our economic adversaries.
[3:04:08.600 --> 3:04:14.600]  He understands cutting the corporate tax rate will flummox China like no tariff could ever do.
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:18.600]  Well sure, that's a form of tariff that our elites put that in with deals with China.
[3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:25.600]  People think of tariffs as a classic tariff. China having no environmental protection when we have all this environmental protection makes it impossible to do business here.
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:26.600]  Exactly.
[3:04:26.600 --> 3:04:30.600]  So you say we don't take your goods until you put environmental protection on?
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:31.600]  There's all sorts of games.
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:39.600]  And Trump understands that the key to rebuilding our national defense, the key to rebuilding our military, the key to a strong foreign policy is economic strength.
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:40.600]  First and foremost.
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:44.600]  Plus you don't let them buy billion dollar fighters, you buy the fighters that actually work.
[3:04:44.600 --> 3:04:45.600]  Exactly.
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:48.600]  So look, I think only Trump understands how to make a great call.
[3:04:48.600 --> 3:04:57.600]  We're going to go to Doug, Kristen, Cindy, and Chris, and that's it for calls. We've got David Knight coming up from the Situation Room. I'm Alex Jones in the War Room.
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:06.600]  Someone on Twitter asks, hey, if you're so against the left-right paradigm, then why do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders?
[3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:13.600]  Listen, the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class. You've got to loot the middle class because that's where the money is.
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:20.600]  If you loot at the tax policy center and the tax foundation, the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most Americans.
[3:05:20.600 --> 3:05:24.600]  It's a very big tax increase for everyone except those at the bottom.
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:32.600]  Everybody loves to get free stuff and politicians are always pitching the idea that the poor and middle class are going to get the benefits and the rich will pay for it.
[3:05:32.600 --> 3:05:38.600]  Americans received more than two trillion dollars in benefits from the federal government in 2014.
[3:05:38.600 --> 3:05:41.600]  Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially.
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:48.600]  The question is, where's the money going to come from after the middle class and the millionaires have been looted and the mega-rich flee the country?
[3:05:48.600 --> 3:06:15.600]  To find out in detail how the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class, visit infowars.com.

[3:06:48.600 --> 3:07:03.600]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built up toxins and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:11.600]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver
[3:07:11.600 --> 3:07:17.600]  and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:25.600]  Liver shield is the only liver support product in the market that uses a patented Spygerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.

[3:07:31.600 --> 3:07:34.600]  This isn't a game and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[3:07:34.600 --> 3:07:43.600]  Liver shield is totally organic and made of the safest high quality herbs, but that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:47.600]  Liver shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:23.600]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:28.600]  You know, it's easy to sit on the sidelines and go along with all the media hype and bash Donald Trump all day.
[3:08:28.600 --> 3:08:33.600]  And I didn't really start even doing research on him until about a year ago.
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:40.600]  But all the actions he's taken are causing irrevocable damage to the criminal power structure that's hijacked our country.
[3:08:40.600 --> 3:08:47.600]  And so I'm not going to back him with half measures. If he does bad things down the road and screws people over, I'm going to come out against him.
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:54.600]  But I know the other people are bad and I know they want to control reality and they want to make myself and my family poor to control me.
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:09:01.600]  I'm done. Roger Stone, a consummate Trump insider, Republican insider in the last decade has been exposing their whole system.
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:10.600]  The Kennedy assassination in 9-11 and influencing Trump, obviously, in a big way. I don't like to brag and say Trump's his own man. He is, obviously, but Stone's one of his major confidants.
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:14.600]  And of course, was good personal friends with Richard Nixon and worked with him.
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:22.600]  And he's here exposing the whole deal. He's part of the whole Florida recount. He's the big insider and he's going up against him because he's all in now.
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:27.600]  Because the globalists want to break this country and make us a corrupt vassal state.
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:31.600]  I want to take a few more calls and get some questions from David Knight and hand the baton to him.
[3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:39.600]  And then tomorrow, I'll be speaking at Brave New Books in downtown Austin, 7-9. We're going to cover the speech and broadcast it on Sunday.
[3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:44.600]  So look for that 4-6 p.m. Central Standard Time because this is a big deal what's happening.
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:53.600]  And a lot of people from the inside as well are moving this year against the establishment because they know the establishment is actually hijackers that want to break the country forever.
[3:09:53.600 --> 3:09:57.600]  Because they're threatened that America might actually try to resurrect itself.
[3:09:57.600 --> 3:10:01.600]  America must fall for globalism to take hold.
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:04.600]  Briefly, we are running the biggest show we've ever run.
[3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:14.600]  On his books that are at infowarstore.com, on the water filters, the non-GMO seeds, on all the nutraceuticals, survival shield x2, supermail vitality, superfinal vitality,
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:26.600]  liver shield, the oxy powder, all 17 of our products at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com or call 888-253-33139.
[3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:28.600]  Your purchase, funds, or operations.
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:31.600]  But this is a once every four years leap year sale.
[3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:34.600]  It's the biggest sale we've ever done, period.
[3:10:34.600 --> 3:10:36.600]  I didn't hype it. I didn't promote it beforehand.
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:38.600]  It snuck up on me because I'm so busy.
[3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:39.600]  Here it is.
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:41.600]  And we're running it until Monday night.
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:45.600]  And then that's all, folks, as they say there on Looney Tunes.
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:49.600]  infowarsstore.com or 888-253-33139.
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:52.600]  And the money we do make from this helps fund the operation.
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:53.600]  But, look.
[3:10:53.600 --> 3:10:55.600]  Alex, I've got to say, I'm a big fan of one of your products.
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:10:57.600]  And I want to mention it, liver shield.
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:04.600]  When I've been on the road doing, you know, what I do with the book signings, the speeches, the interviews, and I get off the road and I'm tired.
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:05.600]  I'm exhausted.
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:06.600]  I've been eating bad.
[3:11:06.600 --> 3:11:07.600]  I've been not getting much sleep.
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:08.600]  I hit liver shield.
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:10.600]  It's rejuvenating.
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:11.600]  I get mental clarity.
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:13.600]  I get better physical energy.
[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:14.600]  It's a great product.
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:17.600]  I'm a big believer in homeopathic medicine.
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:19.600]  So I had to put in the plug.
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:20.600]  I'm a believer.
[3:11:20.600 --> 3:11:23.600]  Well, it's concentrated herbs that are known to help your liver detox.
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:27.600]  You can just take it every day or take it once a week or do the gallbladder cleanse.
[3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:28.600]  It's unbelievable.
[3:11:28.600 --> 3:11:32.600]  It takes six days and you take the oxy powder with it.
[3:11:32.600 --> 3:11:38.600]  And boy, on the seventh day, it is spectacular for almost everybody.
[3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:40.600]  I read the reviews, see the informational videos.
[3:11:40.600 --> 3:11:45.600]  And I think the folks over at Media Matters and Places should do it for themselves, but they won't actually pop if they did.
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:48.600]  And same thing with that lady over there on CNN.
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:51.600]  I've been a little bit sarcastic here, but I do want to go back to your phone calls.
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:52.600]  Thanks for the plug.
[3:11:52.600 --> 3:11:53.600]  I didn't know you were a user of our products.
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:54.600]  Thank you, sir.
[3:11:54.600 --> 3:11:55.600]  Well, they're high quality.
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:57.600]  They're the highest quality we can actually bring folks.
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:01.600]  Plus, we know we're a target of the FDA, a target of the media, a target of the testers.
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:04.600]  And we want it to be high quality, but we have to be at the highest standard out there.
[3:12:04.600 --> 3:12:08.600]  M4sLife.com, take advantage of that. This only comes around every four years.
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:11.600]  Who's up next here to talk to Mr. Stone?
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:13.600]  Doug in Ohio, you're on the air.
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:15.600]  Welcome.
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:16.600]  Hey, Alex.
[3:12:16.600 --> 3:12:18.600]  Welcome, Doug.
[3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:20.600]  Hey, good day, Alex, Mr. Stone.
[3:12:20.600 --> 3:12:21.600]  Hey, as well.
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:27.600]  And now my info warriors out there, as well as we all know, America is the sickest country in the world.
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:31.600]  90% of our food is banned in 160 countries.
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:35.600]  We have a divina dialysis on every corner like a McDonald's.
[3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:37.600]  When will Trump expose this?
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:42.600]  And what will he do to the corporations manufacturing all this poison that they call food?
[3:12:42.600 --> 3:12:44.600]  Another reason, I forget all the good stuff he's done.
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:48.600]  He's come out against vaccines and said that they've got liability protection.
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:49.600]  They need to be studied.
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:50.600]  They're causing problems.
[3:12:50.600 --> 3:12:51.600]  There's too many of them.
[3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:54.600]  Again, I just forget why I like him.
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:12:55.600]  Yeah, he's an independent thinker.
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:12:57.600]  He understands the problem isn't the vaccines.
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:00.600]  The problem is what's in the vaccines, the mercury and other products.
[3:13:00.600 --> 3:13:05.600]  You can imagine how the medical establishment went crazy when he said this.
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:10.600]  Everything you keep saying about him, that's his views.
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:14.600]  Where is he on big pharma, on vaccines, on eugenics?
[3:13:14.600 --> 3:13:18.600]  This is a great call from the listener, Doug.
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:20.600]  Let me just say stay tuned.
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:22.600]  This is just the beginning of the campaign.
[3:13:22.600 --> 3:13:24.600]  We get into the general.
[3:13:24.600 --> 3:13:25.600]  He knows what he's doing.
[3:13:25.600 --> 3:13:26.600]  He rolls it out.
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:27.600]  Well, one thing at a time.
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:30.600]  Willie talks about monetary policy.
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:33.600]  Is it going to be basically Ron Paul meets Alex Jones meets Roger Stone by the end?
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:34.600]  Well, we can only hope.
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:35.600]  It's Donald Trump.
[3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:37.600]  No one puts words in Donald Trump's mouth.
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:41.600]  I am neither a formal nor an informal part of his campaign.
[3:13:41.600 --> 3:13:42.600]  I'm just an FOT.
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:43.600]  I'm a friend of Trump.
[3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:45.600]  Just like I'm an FOJ.
[3:13:45.600 --> 3:13:46.600]  I'm a friend of Jones.
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:48.600]  And I operate completely independently.
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:52.600]  Donald Trump doesn't approve anything I do, nor do I ask for approval.
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:55.600]  But I would do anything he asked me to to help him get elected.
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:13:57.600]  You're like a little angel, a little free agent.
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:01.600]  Well, look, he's the last best hope for this country, folks.
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:05.600]  And that's why I've dedicated the rest of my year through this November to making sure
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:09.600]  that Hillary Clinton has stopped and that she and her husband and her daughter go to
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:13.600]  prison where they belong because their crimes are manifest.
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:18.600]  But more importantly, that we elect somebody who can save this country.
[3:14:18.600 --> 3:14:19.600]  The hour grows late.
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:23.600]  Is Donald Trump or a thousand years of darkness for the United States?
[3:14:23.600 --> 3:14:25.600]  Well, that's the plan.
[3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:26.600]  Thank you, Doug.
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:27.600]  Great question.
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:28.600]  Kristin in Ohio.
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:29.600]  You're on the air worldwide.
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:30.600]  Hi.
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:35.600]  I had a couple of questions, actually.
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:46.600]  My first one is with all the illegal immigration stuff that Donald Trump talks about, wouldn't
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:55.600]  he be smarter to put sanctions on the big companies that are actually hiring the illegal immigrants?
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:14:57.600]  Because that's why they're coming over.
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:01.600]  If they can't, you know, get jobs.
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:02.600]  I'll be honest.
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:06.600]  The wall sounds kind of like just a big campaign stuck as people get it.
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:11.600]  I mean, isn't it go after the employers and then also, you know, incentivize employers
[3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:12.600]  to hire Americans?
[3:15:12.600 --> 3:15:14.600]  Look, give Trump his due.
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:15.600]  He understands the labor market.
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:20.600]  He also understands how, in many cases, you can't find Americans to fill these jobs.
[3:15:20.600 --> 3:15:22.600]  That is just a fact.
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:26.600]  But he's a giant critic of our visa program, unlike Ted Cruz, unlike Marco Rubio.
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:32.600]  And I think you'd see a completely revamping of our current immigration system to one that
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:34.600]  makes sense.
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:40.600]  One thing I can tell you, Donald Trump is not in the pocket of big business or big anything.
[3:15:40.600 --> 3:15:46.600]  Donald Trump believes in American sovereignty and he believes in putting America first.
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:53.600]  So look for Donald Trump to completely revamp, completely rewrite our current flawed, broken
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:56.600]  immigration system.
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:57.600]  Other questions?
[3:15:57.600 --> 3:15:58.600]  Christian?
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:04.600]  Yeah, I just had another one.
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:14.600]  He talks about he wants to expand our military, but isn't the military one of the cost of
[3:16:14.600 --> 3:16:17.600]  the military one of the leading causes of national debt?
[3:16:17.600 --> 3:16:22.600]  I think he says he's going to make it strong and you can do that with half the money without
[3:16:22.600 --> 3:16:24.600]  all these boondoggles and screw jobs.
[3:16:24.600 --> 3:16:28.600]  The F-15 is better than the new billion-dollar fighters that don't even work.
[3:16:28.600 --> 3:16:30.600]  And the $700 toilet seats.
[3:16:30.600 --> 3:16:32.600]  What's Trump's real view?
[3:16:32.600 --> 3:16:38.600]  I think what Trump understands is you can afford a stronger and sleeker and leaner but more
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:42.600]  effective military if you rebuild the American economy.
[3:16:42.600 --> 3:16:47.600]  The problem, of course, is massive defense spending when you're running a deficit, when the
[3:16:47.600 --> 3:16:48.600]  country's broke.
[3:16:48.600 --> 3:16:54.600]  So he understands step one, revitalize our economy, get America cooking again.
[3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:57.600]  Then you can afford a national defense second to none.
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:02.600]  Right now, we're spending on defense, although at inadequate levels, at the same time we're
[3:17:02.600 --> 3:17:03.600]  broke.
[3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:08.600]  Now add to that that we decide, for example, to depose Gaddafi and Libya, but we have to
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:11.600]  go to the national credit card to borrow the $880 million.
[3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:15.600]  Yeah, we got special interest in bringing the country down.
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:17.600]  To bomb Gaddafi into oblivion.
[3:17:17.600 --> 3:17:19.600]  The elites of the side were done.
[3:17:19.600 --> 3:17:21.600]  They're just feeling everything they can right now.
[3:17:21.600 --> 3:17:23.600]  Like you said, Christian, great questions.
[3:17:23.600 --> 3:17:27.600]  I'm going to bring David Knight in for a question or two before he takes over.
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:28.600]  David Knight from the Situation Room.
[3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:31.600]  David Knight, do you have any comments or questions for Mr. Stone?
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:32.600]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:17:32.600 --> 3:17:38.600]  When I looked at what Vincent T. Fox said, his effing comment, when you actually read what
[3:17:38.600 --> 3:17:44.600]  he went on to say beyond that, what he was really angry about was that 44% of Hispanics
[3:17:44.600 --> 3:17:46.600]  had voted for Donald Trump in Nevada.
[3:17:46.600 --> 3:17:47.600]  And I thought it was interesting.
[3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:51.600]  We talked about this a little bit last night just before the debate.
[3:17:51.600 --> 3:17:54.600]  Fox said, it's not to defend our race.
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:18:00.600]  It's not to defend our creed, but to defend the nation that is hosting you.
[3:18:00.600 --> 3:18:06.600]  That raised a ton of questions in my mind, because it sounded like he was appealing to
[3:18:06.600 --> 3:18:11.600]  them to vote on a racial basis on some kind of a creed basis, which I'm not sure what
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:16.600]  that is, but also the fact that he says, defend the nation that is hosting you.
[3:18:16.600 --> 3:18:20.600]  Now, that implies, I guess, that these people are voting when they're not citizens, that
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:21.600]  they're simply being hosted.
[3:18:21.600 --> 3:18:27.600]  It all ties into the North American Union aspect that we're looking at here.
[3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:32.600]  But I wanted to get Roger Stone's comments on that, the idea that this Mexican, former
[3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:33.600]  Mexican president is saying you're not.
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:34.600]  Exactly.
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:38.600]  Doesn't this show the insane arrogance of the establishment that the pope and the Chinese
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:41.600]  communist leaders and the Mexican former president, with all his brother, the one of the biggest
[3:18:41.600 --> 3:18:44.600]  drug dealers out there on record, telling us what to do?
[3:18:44.600 --> 3:18:46.600]  No, Mexico would laugh at us if we did that.
[3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:50.600]  Yeah, I'm very familiar, of course, with the North American Union.
[3:18:50.600 --> 3:18:56.600]  As you know, Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, has been a major progenitor of that through her membership
[3:18:56.600 --> 3:18:58.600]  at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[3:18:58.600 --> 3:19:01.600]  Look, here's BB My Message for Vicente Fox.
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:04.600]  The Trump Justice Department's coming for your brother.
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:06.600]  They're coming for your brother.
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:07.600]  They're going to arrest him.
[3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:11.600]  They're going to prosecute him, and they're going to jail him because he is poisoning
[3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:12.600]  our children.
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:15.600]  And you're going to be investigated too, Fox, just like when I bullhorned you.
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:17.600]  Fox is a criminal.
[3:19:17.600 --> 3:19:18.600]  His brother is a criminal.
[3:19:18.600 --> 3:19:21.600]  Most of those in the Mexican government are criminals.
[3:19:21.600 --> 3:19:22.600]  And Trump is exactly right.
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:24.600]  They're shipping us the rapists.
[3:19:24.600 --> 3:19:26.600]  They're shipping us the scum.
[3:19:26.600 --> 3:19:27.600]  They're shipping us the criminals.
[3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:29.600]  And then it's a con game, like a raped woman.
[3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:32.600]  He sits there slapping us and choking us, saying it's our fault.
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:33.600]  Here's the irony.
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:34.600]  No, get off us, you rapist.
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:37.600]  Here's the irony, and the liberals are going to hate this.
[3:19:37.600 --> 3:19:41.600]  Donald Trump will get record numbers of African-American votes.
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:42.600]  He already is.
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:43.600]  The polls show it.
[3:19:43.600 --> 3:19:44.600]  Record numbers of Hispanic votes.
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:48.600]  Tell us how he'll destroy Hillary because he really will in the numbers.
[3:19:48.600 --> 3:19:52.600]  If young black men are incarcerated in this country, it's because of Bill Clinton.
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:19:56.600]  It's because of the crime bill that Bill Clinton signed.
[3:19:56.600 --> 3:20:01.600]  These are people, black people, who Hillary Clinton said had to be made to heal.
[3:20:01.600 --> 3:20:04.600]  In other words, she said that they were super predators.
[3:20:04.600 --> 3:20:06.600]  Yes, and that they had to be made to heal.
[3:20:06.600 --> 3:20:08.600]  Look, folks, this is very simple.
[3:20:08.600 --> 3:20:13.600]  Black lives matter unless you're Bill Clinton's African-American son, Danny Williams.
[3:20:13.600 --> 3:20:17.600]  In which case, your life doesn't matter because you've been banished by Hillary.
[3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:19.600]  Bill Clinton has a black son.
[3:20:19.600 --> 3:20:21.600]  He's a fine young man.
[3:20:21.600 --> 3:20:24.600]  He's been discarded like a piece of garbage.
[3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:29.600]  And the Washington Post writes, oh, a DNA test proved that that was all false.
[3:20:29.600 --> 3:20:31.600]  No, folks, there is no DNA test.
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:34.600]  Bill has a black son, Danny Williams.
[3:20:34.600 --> 3:20:36.600]  Hillary Clinton is the one who banished him.
[3:20:36.600 --> 3:20:41.600]  Wait until African-American voters hear about this, and they will.
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:43.600]  And that's why they're banning you all over TV.
[3:20:43.600 --> 3:20:45.600]  Absolutely, because they're scared of the truth.
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:49.600]  They know when it comes to the Clintons and the Bushes, I'm a truth teller.
[3:20:49.600 --> 3:20:52.600]  Well, I've read your books, and I've lived battling the Clintons,
[3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:55.600]  and I've lived exposing the OK, and they're dead on.
[3:20:55.600 --> 3:20:57.600]  Well, I've lived inside the belly of the beast.
[3:20:57.600 --> 3:21:00.600]  I know the dirty secrets of the political establishment,
[3:21:00.600 --> 3:21:02.600]  and folks, I'm not going to be silenced.
[3:21:02.600 --> 3:21:07.600]  I'm not going to be shut up by the twisted freaks that media matters from America.
[3:21:07.600 --> 3:21:10.600]  These people are an adjunct of the Clinton Foundation,
[3:21:10.600 --> 3:21:12.600]  an adjunct of the Clinton Foundation.
[3:21:12.600 --> 3:21:14.600]  And they give the orders to MSNBC and CNN.
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:17.600]  They literally give orders in there, and they follow it the next day.
[3:21:17.600 --> 3:21:18.600]  How pathetic!
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:20.600]  White House run dirt bags.
[3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:25.600]  So what it proves is that CNN is not a legitimate news organization.
[3:21:25.600 --> 3:21:28.600]  They're merely an adjunct of the Clinton spin machine.
[3:21:28.600 --> 3:21:31.600]  Yeah, saying that, I guess Fox is really great compared to them.
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:35.600]  And Alex, that ties into what I was going to also say to Roger Stone.
[3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:37.600]  When we look at the way this debate was set up last night,
[3:21:37.600 --> 3:21:40.600]  of course, it was CNN and Telemundo.
[3:21:40.600 --> 3:21:42.600]  And I think that was also an effort.
[3:21:42.600 --> 3:21:44.600]  Everything was targeted towards Trump.
[3:21:44.600 --> 3:21:46.600]  We'll see what Telemundo thinks.
[3:21:46.600 --> 3:21:51.600]  They're upset because Trump won the majority of the Hispanic vote.
[3:21:51.600 --> 3:21:55.600]  And so they're trying to play the race card just as Fox had said,
[3:21:55.600 --> 3:21:56.600]  as Vicente Fox had said.
[3:21:56.600 --> 3:21:58.600]  Even Fox this morning, the talking point was,
[3:21:58.600 --> 3:22:00.600]  it's whites that are angry.
[3:22:00.600 --> 3:22:01.600]  That's why they like Trump.
[3:22:01.600 --> 3:22:02.600]  What?
[3:22:02.600 --> 3:22:04.600]  I'm tired of seeing everything shut down.
[3:22:04.600 --> 3:22:05.600]  I want prosperity.
[3:22:05.600 --> 3:22:07.600]  Taxes, that's nothing to do with what color I am.
[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:10.600]  Donald Trump's entire message is aspirational.
[3:22:10.600 --> 3:22:13.600]  Trump stands for economic opportunity for growth.
[3:22:13.600 --> 3:22:16.600]  I'll tell you what black people want, what Hispanic people want.
[3:22:16.600 --> 3:22:18.600]  They want a piece of the pie.
[3:22:18.600 --> 3:22:19.600]  They want American prosperity.
[3:22:19.600 --> 3:22:21.600]  But Farrakhan said, give us some of this dirt.
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:22.600]  They don't want to be employees.
[3:22:22.600 --> 3:22:24.600]  They want to be employers.
[3:22:24.600 --> 3:22:26.600]  Trump understands the aspiration.
[3:22:26.600 --> 3:22:29.600]  Could you believe that Farrakhan even came out to us and said,
[3:22:29.600 --> 3:22:30.600]  Donald Trump is right.
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:33.600]  You can't bring in all these radical Muslims because a bunch of them are terrorists.
[3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:35.600]  A bunch of other Muslims look bad.
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:38.600]  And I think Donald Trump might want to actually get the country going again.
[3:22:38.600 --> 3:22:39.600]  I mean, that was crazy.
[3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:40.600]  Trump stands for prosperity.
[3:22:40.600 --> 3:22:43.600]  I think most Americans understand that.
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:45.600]  I'm going to hand this back over to you here.
[3:22:45.600 --> 3:22:46.600]  We've got more calls.
[3:22:46.600 --> 3:22:47.600]  I know you can go to them.
[3:22:47.600 --> 3:22:49.600]  And you've got a lot more coming up today to have a night.
[3:22:49.600 --> 3:22:52.600]  But any other questions here for Mr. Stone?
[3:22:52.600 --> 3:22:54.600]  Well, I just think that's exactly the case.
[3:22:54.600 --> 3:22:59.600]  As we're looking last night, we had the Telemundo reporter that kept going back to these issues
[3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:02.600]  that were very narrow, like bankruptcy for Puerto Rico.
[3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:05.600]  What he doesn't understand is what you were just saying there.
[3:23:05.600 --> 3:23:11.600]  The fact that he transcends all the demographics and we don't need to be compartmentalized
[3:23:11.600 --> 3:23:13.600]  into this kind of Balkanized reaction.
[3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:15.600]  Let me stop you, David.
[3:23:15.600 --> 3:23:16.600]  Repeat what you've said.
[3:23:16.600 --> 3:23:17.600]  Stone hasn't heard it.
[3:23:17.600 --> 3:23:20.600]  Just a few months ago, you were still on the fence about Trump because, you know,
[3:23:20.600 --> 3:23:22.600]  you're a pure constitutionalist.
[3:23:22.600 --> 3:23:24.600]  And I respect that's why I hired you.
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:25.600]  I don't control what you say.
[3:23:25.600 --> 3:23:26.600]  Sometimes we disagree.
[3:23:26.600 --> 3:23:28.600]  There are folks in this office still that don't like Trump.
[3:23:28.600 --> 3:23:29.600]  That's fine.
[3:23:29.600 --> 3:23:31.600]  I just don't need to be judged like I'm bad because, you know,
[3:23:31.600 --> 3:23:33.600]  I don't have the...
[3:23:33.600 --> 3:23:34.600]  It's not a purist issue.
[3:23:34.600 --> 3:23:36.600]  The whole power structure is against him.
[3:23:36.600 --> 3:23:38.600]  He represents populism.
[3:23:38.600 --> 3:23:41.600]  If he turns bad later, that isn't even the issue now.
[3:23:41.600 --> 3:23:42.600]  We know what we got is bad.
[3:23:42.600 --> 3:23:43.600]  This is all in.
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:45.600]  How are we going to feel if they shoot him and kill him?
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:46.600]  Set him up.
[3:23:46.600 --> 3:23:47.600]  His plane blows up.
[3:23:47.600 --> 3:23:49.600]  They steal the election from him.
[3:23:49.600 --> 3:23:51.600]  He'll be a hero regardless.
[3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:54.600]  So I'm just not going to sit here on the fence, hot and or warm.
[3:23:54.600 --> 3:23:55.600]  I spit you out of my mouth.
[3:23:55.600 --> 3:23:56.600]  I'm all in for Trump.
[3:23:56.600 --> 3:23:58.600]  I'll criticize stuff I disagree with.
[3:23:58.600 --> 3:23:59.600]  He crosses too many lines.
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:01.600]  I'll say, okay, I think Trump's got problems.
[3:24:01.600 --> 3:24:03.600]  And I won't be ashamed to say it.
[3:24:03.600 --> 3:24:04.600]  I don't buy into a person.
[3:24:04.600 --> 3:24:05.600]  I buy into a movement.
[3:24:05.600 --> 3:24:06.600]  An idea.
[3:24:06.600 --> 3:24:07.600]  My gut tells me it's the right move.
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:09.600]  But you now have a saying you're going to vote for Trump.
[3:24:09.600 --> 3:24:11.600]  I think we're going today to vote.
[3:24:11.600 --> 3:24:14.600]  You and I and others are going to go videotape it as well.
[3:24:14.600 --> 3:24:16.600]  Because it's early voting for next Monday.
[3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:17.600]  Everybody should go vote.
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:19.600]  And I got a little voter card in the whole nine yards.
[3:24:19.600 --> 3:24:20.600]  This is the first time.
[3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:21.600]  I'll be honest.
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:23.600]  I've voted in about eight years because as a political guy,
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:26.600]  I can cover a lot of stuff, get millions of votes for people.
[3:24:26.600 --> 3:24:28.600]  But plus, I know there's so much hanky-panky going on.
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:29.600]  But this is so big.
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:31.600]  I'm actually going to vote today.
[3:24:31.600 --> 3:24:33.600]  We're going to videotape the whole thing.
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:38.600]  And so share your testimony of why you've now converted to,
[3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:40.600]  you know, not buying into all of Trump, as you said,
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:42.600]  but you're going to vote for him in the Texas primary.
[3:24:42.600 --> 3:24:43.600]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:45.600]  When I look at issues that I disagree with Trump on,
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:48.600]  things like imminent domain, other issues of individual liberty.
[3:24:48.600 --> 3:24:50.600]  I don't see a difference between Trump
[3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:52.600]  or the rest of the Republican candidates.
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:54.600]  Certainly not between him and the Democratic candidates.
[3:24:54.600 --> 3:24:58.600]  But what I do see are some core issues.
[3:24:58.600 --> 3:25:01.600]  And as I've mentioned before, the three core issues about
[3:25:01.600 --> 3:25:05.600]  globalist control, and I believe that I can trust him on that
[3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:09.600]  because 35 years ago, he's paying $100,000 to take out ads
[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:12.600]  complaining about the managed trade.
[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:13.600]  It's not free trade.
[3:25:13.600 --> 3:25:14.600]  It's managed trade.
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:16.600]  It's being managed by people outside of our country
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:17.600]  to their disadvantage.
[3:25:17.600 --> 3:25:18.600]  To take out.
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:19.600]  Exactly.
[3:25:19.600 --> 3:25:21.600]  And so he understands that we're at the core where these things
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:22.600]  are coming together now.
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:24.600]  And we look at the open borders.
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:27.600]  That's an attempt to balkanize the societies of the West
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.600]  as well as to manage our trade with these international trade
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:33.600]  agreements, TPP, TTIP.
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:35.600]  They're going to manage these trade agreements with an
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:38.600]  international commission that is not accountable to us.
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:40.600]  It's not appointed by us.
[3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:42.600]  Senator Sessions has pointed that out.
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:45.600]  And so we're going to have managed trade managed by an
[3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:47.600]  unaccountable commission outside of us.
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:49.600]  And then of course you've got the climate treaty issue,
[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:54.600]  which would be a globalist tax imposed upon us again by
[3:25:54.600 --> 3:25:55.600]  the multinational commission.
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:25:57.600]  He says vaccines have bad additives.
[3:25:57.600 --> 3:25:58.600]  We look at it.
[3:25:58.600 --> 3:26:00.600]  He says he's going to prosecute Hillary.
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:03.600]  He's going to investigate 9-11 truth opposed to cap and trade.
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:04.600]  I mean, he just goes on and on.
[3:26:04.600 --> 3:26:06.600]  I don't know how we couldn't support him.
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:07.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:10.600]  So there's a lot of issues that are within the purview of the
[3:26:10.600 --> 3:26:11.600]  president to do something about it.
[3:26:11.600 --> 3:26:14.600]  And when it comes to liberty, we all have to understand nobody
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:16.600]  is going to give you your freedom.
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:17.600]  You have to take it.
[3:26:17.600 --> 3:26:20.600]  And I believe that's a fight that we really need to do at the
[3:26:20.600 --> 3:26:21.600]  local and the state level.
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:23.600]  We can do it with things like jury nullification, state
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:24.600]  nullification, things like that.
[3:26:24.600 --> 3:26:27.600]  We're not going to get everything done by a president at
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:28.600]  the federal level.
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:30.600]  That's just the reality of things.
[3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:32.600]  So we need to win where we can win.
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:34.600]  If we've got somebody that I believe we can trust because this
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:37.600]  has been an issue for him his entire life on this trade issue,
[3:26:37.600 --> 3:26:39.600]  this destroying our country on the border issue,
[3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:42.600]  which is a part of that on the climate issue, cap and trade.
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:43.600]  That's also a part of that.
[3:26:43.600 --> 3:26:44.600]  Absolutely.
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:46.600]  And then they're scared to death out of him for real.
[3:26:46.600 --> 3:26:48.600]  They're doing things that no person who was with the system
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:49.600]  will do in their right mind.
[3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:52.600]  Do you agree, Stone, in closing, that we're seeing irrevocable
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:55.600]  harm to the corrupt kleptocrats that have hijacked the nation
[3:26:55.600 --> 3:27:01.600]  and that regardless, Trump is dealing grievous blows to the
[3:27:01.600 --> 3:27:03.600]  system that will be felt for decades?
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:06.600]  Look, Alex, I don't argue that Donald Trump is a pure conservative.
[3:27:06.600 --> 3:27:09.600]  My friends at National Review and those guys are my friends,
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:10.600]  that's their thing.
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:11.600]  They're looking for purism.
[3:27:11.600 --> 3:27:12.600]  How pure they are.
[3:27:12.600 --> 3:27:15.600]  I argue simple that he is the best choice for conservatives in
[3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:18.600]  2016 because on the big picture issues,
[3:27:18.600 --> 3:27:21.600]  our fiscal situation, our immigration situation,
[3:27:21.600 --> 3:27:24.600]  our trade situation, our foreign policy,
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:27.600]  he's the best choice for conservatives this year.
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:28.600]  That's why I'm...
[3:27:28.600 --> 3:27:31.600]  Yeah, look, you know, the holier-than-thou conservatives
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:32.600]  have sold us out.
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:33.600]  They're rather straight.
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:35.600]  Their actions are bad.
[3:27:35.600 --> 3:27:38.600]  They can sit there and talk about, you know, pure stuff all day long.
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:39.600]  They haven't delivered.
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:43.600]  And they're scared that their buddies that control the big pie
[3:27:43.600 --> 3:27:46.600]  and are running the show might not be in charge anymore.
[3:27:46.600 --> 3:27:47.600]  That's what all this is about.
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:50.600]  Is they're afraid he's in there nuzzling them out of the trough?
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:52.600]  They may think he's worse than they are.
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:55.600]  They are genuinely scared of Donald Trump.
[3:27:55.600 --> 3:27:56.600]  Absolutely.
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:27:58.600]  Alex, it's been a great pleasure to be with you.
[3:27:58.600 --> 3:28:01.600]  Come out and see me at Brave New Books here in Austin tomorrow night,
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:02.600]  7 to 9.
[3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:03.600]  I'm going to speak.
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:04.600]  I'm going to take some questions.
[3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:05.600]  I'm going to sign some books.
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:07.600]  It's very exciting to do a grassroots thing like that
[3:28:07.600 --> 3:28:09.600]  to see the real people come out.
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:10.600]  And it's extraordinary.
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:12.600]  People are hungry for the truth.
[3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:13.600]  They're ready for leadership.
[3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:17.600]  And I think more and more they recognize Donald Trump is the last best hope
[3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:18.600]  for this country.
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:20.600]  Well, he sure got the establishment having a heart attack.
[3:28:20.600 --> 3:28:22.600]  David, I'm going to hand the baton back to you.
[3:28:22.600 --> 3:28:23.600]  You've got a lot of callers there.
[3:28:23.600 --> 3:28:24.600]  Thank you so much.
[3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:28.600]  A great job with the crew last night covering the final Republican
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:30.600]  debate before Super Tuesday.
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:33.600]  These are epic times to be alive for the viewers and listeners.
[3:28:33.600 --> 3:28:37.600]  Get involved now, whether it's local, international, whatever your
[3:28:37.600 --> 3:28:41.600]  organic farming, right to self-defense, you name it.
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:42.600]  Now is the time to be involved.
[3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:44.600]  The future of our world being shaped.
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:47.600]  Don't forget to support infowars.com and our sponsors.
[3:28:47.600 --> 3:28:50.600]  And we're doing the biggest sale in our history, 30% off everything
[3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:51.600]  at infowarsstore.com.

[3:28:55.600 --> 3:28:56.600]  It's the leap year sale.
[3:28:56.600 --> 3:28:59.600]  It's bigger than Black Friday and it runs through next Monday.
[3:28:59.600 --> 3:29:01.600]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:02.600]  Alex, great to be here.
[3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:03.600]  David Knight, you're in charge.
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:04.600]  God bless you.
[3:29:04.600 --> 3:29:07.600]  Well, Alex, I want to take some of the calls here.
[3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:10.600]  But before we do, of course, last night was actually a lot of fun.
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:12.600]  It was a free-for-all brawl.
[3:29:12.600 --> 3:29:15.600]  And there's been some fallout from this.
[3:29:15.600 --> 3:29:18.600]  I want to get your comments about what you thought about the debate
[3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:19.600]  last night.
[3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:21.600]  One of the things that I thought was interesting that developed this
[3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:24.600]  last week was the push for appointing a Supreme Court
[3:29:24.600 --> 3:29:26.600]  replacement for Scalia.
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:29.600]  And I thought it was very interesting that the Democrats got
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:32.600]  together and offered this to a Republican governor from Nevada
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:34.600]  who is sitting there.
[3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:37.600]  That could have been very difficult for the Republicans to handle.
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:40.600]  But of course, Mitch McConnell called him up and then he declined
[3:29:40.600 --> 3:29:41.600]  the offer.
[3:29:41.600 --> 3:29:44.600]  So maybe they really do mean that they're going to allow the
[3:29:44.600 --> 3:29:47.600]  next president to select Supreme Court justices.
[3:29:47.600 --> 3:29:48.600]  We'll see.
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:49.600]  We're on the march.
[3:29:49.600 --> 3:29:51.600]  The empire's on the run.
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:54.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:59.600 --> 3:30:02.600]  It turns out Hillary Clinton and her top aides aren't the only
[3:30:02.600 --> 3:30:05.600]  ones with secret email aliases.
[3:30:05.600 --> 3:30:08.600]  Documents uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act
[3:30:08.600 --> 3:30:12.600]  reveal that former Attorney General Eric Holder used a false name
[3:30:12.600 --> 3:30:15.600]  for his official Justice Department email account.
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:19.600]  According to documents obtained by Vice News, all mentions of
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:24.600]  Lou Alcindor, the birth name of basketball player Karim Abdul-Jabbar,
[3:30:24.600 --> 3:30:26.600]  were actually referring to Holder himself.
[3:30:26.600 --> 3:30:29.600]  In response to the FOIA release, a Justice Department spokesman
[3:30:29.600 --> 3:30:32.600]  said the Holder's actions, they're not improper, legally
[3:30:32.600 --> 3:30:36.600]  questionable or used to thwart FOIA requests seeking information
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:38.600]  on the former Attorney General.
[3:30:38.600 --> 3:30:40.600]  Hmm, where have we heard that before?
[3:30:40.600 --> 3:30:44.600]  Experts in FOIA law say Holder's Lou Alcindor identity calls
[3:30:44.600 --> 3:30:48.600]  into question the ability of FOIA staff to locate all emails
[3:30:48.600 --> 3:30:51.600]  from an official who uses an alias.
[3:30:51.600 --> 3:30:54.600]  Indeed, you can read more at infowars.com.
[3:30:54.600 --> 3:30:59.600]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[3:30:59.600 --> 3:31:03.600]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors
[3:31:03.600 --> 3:31:07.600]  of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:31:07.600 --> 3:31:11.600]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching
[3:31:11.600 --> 3:31:15.600]  filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[3:31:15.600 --> 3:31:20.600]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[3:31:20.600 --> 3:31:24.600]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics
[3:31:24.600 --> 3:31:27.600]  that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones,
[3:31:27.600 --> 3:31:30.600]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:31:30.600 --> 3:31:33.600]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[3:31:33.600 --> 3:31:38.600]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[3:31:38.600 --> 3:31:43.600]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:44.600]  inside the human body.
[3:31:44.600 --> 3:31:47.600]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned into so many weapons
[3:31:47.600 --> 3:31:50.600]  inside the human body. Discover why Anthroplex has turned
[3:31:50.600 --> 3:31:51.600]  into so many heads today.
[3:31:51.600 --> 3:31:54.600]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[3:31:54.600 --> 3:31:57.600]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[3:31:57.600 --> 3:31:59.600]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male
[3:31:59.600 --> 3:32:02.600]  and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[3:32:02.600 --> 3:32:05.600]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband,
[3:32:05.600 --> 3:32:07.600]  I had to try it for myself.
[3:32:07.600 --> 3:32:08.600]  Talk about the effects.
[3:32:08.600 --> 3:32:10.600]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[3:32:10.600 --> 3:32:11.600]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:13.600]  I feel like I look better. I feel better.
[3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:15.600]  I feel sexier. I love it.
[3:32:15.600 --> 3:32:17.600]  Even if you don't believe in supplements,
[3:32:17.600 --> 3:32:19.600]  take the challenge. Get a bottle of Super Male,
[3:32:19.600 --> 3:32:21.600]  a bottle of Super Female.

[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:31.600]  Last night was kind of like Reservoir Dogs, wasn't it?
[3:33:31.600 --> 3:33:35.600]  That's right. At one point, when he was calling Rubio a choker,
[3:33:35.600 --> 3:33:37.600]  I said, yeah, liars to the left of me.
[3:33:37.600 --> 3:33:39.600]  He kind of points to the crews.
[3:33:39.600 --> 3:33:41.600]  He says, chokers to the right.
[3:33:41.600 --> 3:33:44.600]  I think Rubio was just upset because he's Mr. Pink.
[3:33:44.600 --> 3:33:47.600]  You know, he can't get away from what happened
[3:33:47.600 --> 3:33:49.600]  and the research is coming out.
[3:33:49.600 --> 3:33:51.600]  I don't know what I mean.
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:54.600]  Look up Wayne Madsen's story about Marco Rubio.
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:33:56.600]  And the other thing about the debate last night
[3:33:56.600 --> 3:33:58.600]  was just, and I mentioned it to Roger Stone,
[3:33:58.600 --> 3:34:01.600]  the fact that it was very clearly set up
[3:34:01.600 --> 3:34:05.600]  to come after Donald Trump just before the Super Tuesday,
[3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:07.600]  bringing in Telemundo.
[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:10.600]  And I was so annoyed at the narrow focus
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:12.600]  of the Telemundo reporter.
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:15.600]  Everything was simply about Hispanics.
[3:34:15.600 --> 3:34:18.600]  What they don't get is that Donald Trump won
[3:34:18.600 --> 3:34:20.600]  the Hispanic vote in Nevada,
[3:34:20.600 --> 3:34:22.600]  and that's something that really upsets
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:25.600]  the people who try to balkanize us into these groups.
[3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:27.600]  I saw this thing on Twitter, somebody put up,
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:29.600]  and I thought it was really funny.
[3:34:29.600 --> 3:34:31.600]  It's a picture of a dog, for those of you on the radio,
[3:34:31.600 --> 3:34:33.600]  a picture of a dog, and then the CNN logo,
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:35.600]  the lower thirds, and it says, question.
[3:34:35.600 --> 3:34:38.600]  As president, will you extend off leash hours
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:42.600]  and parks across the country, specifically Central Park?
[3:34:42.600 --> 3:34:46.600]  See, that's the kind of ridiculous, narrow questioning
[3:34:46.600 --> 3:34:48.600]  that we were getting from Telemundo.
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:50.600]  So I retweeted that out, and I said, well,
[3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:52.600]  was this dog from Telafido,
[3:34:52.600 --> 3:34:55.600]  or maybe he's a roving reporter from Animal Planet,
[3:34:55.600 --> 3:34:57.600]  because that's the only thing they're interested in.
[3:34:57.600 --> 3:35:01.600]  They're not interested in the big picture issues.
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:04.600]  And that's what we saw last night, very narrowly focused,
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:08.600]  very narrowly focused in terms of attacking Donald Trump.
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:11.600]  And of course, it did get Donald Trump angry.
[3:35:11.600 --> 3:35:14.600]  He lashed out in some Twitter tirades
[3:35:14.600 --> 3:35:16.600]  that had some spelling errors in them.
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:19.600]  And Marco Rubio, I guess taking up his new role
[3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:22.600]  as a little troll, became a little grammar Nazi
[3:35:22.600 --> 3:35:25.600]  about the typo errors.
[3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:29.600]  Perhaps Donald Trump might want to rethink this iPhone boycott.
[3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:31.600]  Maybe he needs to go back to something
[3:35:31.600 --> 3:35:33.600]  that's going to be auto-correcting
[3:35:33.600 --> 3:35:35.600]  or helping with that a little bit.
[3:35:35.600 --> 3:35:38.600]  Although, auto-correct can be your enema at times.
[3:35:38.600 --> 3:35:41.600]  But nevertheless, that's something that I think is going to come out.
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:45.600]  But he did have a massive Trump card to play,
[3:35:45.600 --> 3:35:47.600]  and that was the Chris Christie endorsement.
[3:35:47.600 --> 3:35:52.600]  Chris Christie had some pretty harsh words for Marco Rubio,
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:54.600]  as well as some compliments for Donald Trump.
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:35:58.600]  One of the things that I think showed that this was really a rigged debate
[3:35:58.600 --> 3:36:01.600]  was this woman who was screaming.
[3:36:01.600 --> 3:36:04.600]  And of course, we know they pack the audience.
[3:36:04.600 --> 3:36:07.600]  Earlier yesterday, we had the story about how only six students
[3:36:07.600 --> 3:36:11.600]  from the University of Houston were going to be allowed into the debate.
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:13.600]  There were 800 tickets,
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:17.600]  and those typically all go to insiders, to the donor class.
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:20.600]  But they went one beyond that.
[3:36:20.600 --> 3:36:23.600]  As we looked at Rubio's performance last night,
[3:36:23.600 --> 3:36:25.600]  and that's what it was, it was a performance,
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:29.600]  it was pretty obvious that he had a list of accusations
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:31.600]  he was going to throw out at Donald Trump
[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:35.600]  and just keep throwing them out without allowing a response to any of those.
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:38.600]  But the key thing I thought was the audience reaction,
[3:36:38.600 --> 3:36:44.600]  and that lady who was screaming as a big fan there.
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:46.600]  And this is something that Twitter has picked up on.
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:49.600]  See, back in the day, that could be very effective,
[3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:52.600]  kind of doing that like the sitcom Laugh Track.
[3:36:52.600 --> 3:36:54.600]  Remember, I love Lucy.
[3:36:54.600 --> 3:36:57.600]  There was always that woman for those of you old enough.
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:36:59.600]  It's kind of become a cultural meme.
[3:36:59.600 --> 3:37:02.600]  I think even if you're younger, you may know I love Lucy.
[3:37:02.600 --> 3:37:05.600]  They would get to this point and they'd be this one would go,
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:07.600]  uh-oh, and then the laughter would be fed in.
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:09.600]  It was a canned thing.
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:11.600]  But you can hire people to do that sort of thing.
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:14.600]  This particular woman, as I point out on Daily Mail,
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:16.600]  and Twitter has picked up on it,
[3:37:16.600 --> 3:37:18.600]  Marco Rubio's number one fan
[3:37:18.600 --> 3:37:21.600]  couldn't hide her enthusiasm during Thursday's debate in Texas.
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:24.600]  One woman in the crowd could be heard several times
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:28.600]  throughout the evening letting out a high-pitched shriek
[3:37:28.600 --> 3:37:30.600]  combined with a squeal.
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:33.600]  The unidentified woman seemed to make the unique sound
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:37.600]  for only one candidate, however, Marco Rubio.
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:39.600]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[3:37:39.600 --> 3:37:41.600]  So, Matt Popovich says,
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:43.600]  Rubio, we know you love America,
[3:37:43.600 --> 3:37:47.600]  but bringing in an actual eagle to shriek every time you say something
[3:37:47.600 --> 3:37:50.600]  might have been taking it a bit too far.
[3:37:50.600 --> 3:37:51.600]  That's exactly it.
[3:37:51.600 --> 3:37:54.600]  So, there's a lot of Twitter feeds about that.
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:37:56.600]  And then this last one here.
[3:37:56.600 --> 3:37:58.600]  This picture is, again, from Daily Mail,
[3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:00.600]  the subtitle that just about summed it all up,
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:02.600]  CNN's subtitle, closed captions,
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:03.600]  couldn't keep up with the fiery debate
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:05.600]  because everybody was talking at once.
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:07.600]  So, what they put at the bottom here is,
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:10.600]  in brackets, unintelligible yelling
[3:38:10.600 --> 3:38:12.600]  because that's what it integrated into.
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:14.600]  Yeah, it was a real reservoir dog fight.
[3:38:14.600 --> 3:38:17.600]  It was pretty amazing, very entertaining,
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:19.600]  but there's some real core issues,
[3:38:19.600 --> 3:38:21.600]  and we talked about that earlier.
[3:38:21.600 --> 3:38:22.600]  The thing I'm concerned about,
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:23.600]  and I want to play a clip for you.
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:26.600]  We began our coverage last night with this clip.
[3:38:26.600 --> 3:38:28.600]  I want to play something for you
[3:38:28.600 --> 3:38:30.600]  because earlier in the program,
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:33.600]  Roger Stone was talking about the Brokered Convention,
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:35.600]  how they're going to select the delegates.
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:37.600]  I think many people in the Democratic Party
[3:38:37.600 --> 3:38:40.600]  were amazed to see,
[3:38:40.600 --> 3:38:41.600]  and when they look at the delegate count,
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:43.600]  you know, you got several hundred for Hillary Clinton
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:45.600]  because that's where she started out.
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:48.600]  She started out with several hundred back in November.
[3:38:48.600 --> 3:38:51.600]  Those are the party insiders, the elected officials.
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:54.600]  And, of course, they get to vote however they wish,
[3:38:54.600 --> 3:38:56.600]  regardless of what the voters want.
[3:38:56.600 --> 3:38:59.600]  But they are posting those superdelegates
[3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:00.600]  on the Democrat side.
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:02.600]  A little bit more open, actually,
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:04.600]  about how they're rigging the contest
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:05.600]  than the Republicans are.
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:09.600]  But we had a rare candid moment from the RNC head.
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:11.600]  The Republican National Committee chair
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:13.600]  writes Prebis,
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:16.600]  and he had an interview with CNN's Allison Camarota.
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:18.600]  And I want to play you a little bit of this
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:20.600]  because it's absolutely amazing what he says.
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:23.600]  He makes it sound as if the RNC
[3:39:23.600 --> 3:39:25.600]  is some kind of a private club,
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:27.600]  and they're auditioning people.
[3:39:27.600 --> 3:39:29.600]  Listen to what he has to say.
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:31.600]  Let's keep in mind, you asked a question
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:33.600]  in a way that I think is a little bit-
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:34.600]  Pause it a second, pause it a second.
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:35.600]  These folks are-
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:37.600]  Okay, let me give you that introduction.
[3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:42.600]  She says, isn't it time for the Republican leadership
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:44.600]  to understand they've got a front-rotor
[3:39:44.600 --> 3:39:45.600]  and to get behind Donald Trump
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:48.600]  instead of continually pushing against him,
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:50.600]  trying to bring up somebody like Marco Rubio,
[3:39:50.600 --> 3:39:52.600]  who's down at around 20%,
[3:39:52.600 --> 3:39:54.600]  and it's been kind of his ceiling as to what he's got.
[3:39:54.600 --> 3:39:57.600]  So is it time that the RNC would start to call us
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:39:59.600]  around their front-runner?
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:01.600]  And this is what he has to say.
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:03.600]  Let's keep in mind, you asked a question
[3:40:03.600 --> 3:40:05.600]  in a way that I think is a little bit-
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:09.600]  These folks are competing to join us.
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:10.600]  To join us.
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:11.600]  That's what's happening, right?
[3:40:11.600 --> 3:40:14.600]  So they're competing to join the Republican Party
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:17.600]  as our nominee, depending on what the delegates decide
[3:40:17.600 --> 3:40:20.600]  to do or who wins the requisite amount of delegates
[3:40:20.600 --> 3:40:22.600]  to do whatever that is.
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:23.600]  Well, sort of.
[3:40:23.600 --> 3:40:25.600]  But it is a relationship, an election, isn't it?
[3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:28.600]  They're competing to be the nominee of the Republican Party.
[3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:31.600]  Yes, but they're competing to become the president
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:32.600]  of the United States,
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:36.600]  and so they are looking for voters, all voters.
[3:40:36.600 --> 3:40:37.600]  Not voters.
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:39.600]  He's going to talk about delegates now.
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:40.600]  No, they're not.
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:41.600]  They're competing-
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:44.600]  Well, I haven't been on any of my points.
[3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:47.600]  There are two major political parties in America.
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:50.600]  And he goes on to say, yeah, there's these two major
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:53.600]  political parties, and see, we get to decide.
[3:40:53.600 --> 3:40:54.600]  It's not an election.
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:40:55.600]  It's a selection.
[3:40:55.600 --> 3:40:57.600]  She says, but wait a minute,
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:00.600]  but we're having this election and they got to be able to vote.
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:01.600]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3:41:01.600 --> 3:41:03.600]  He says, this is about the delegates.
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:05.600]  Listen, let's understand something.
[3:41:05.600 --> 3:41:09.600]  They have 150 delegates in the Republican Party
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:10.600]  that are superdelegates.
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:12.600]  So that's not as many as the superdelegates
[3:41:12.600 --> 3:41:13.600]  in the Democrat Party,
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:18.600]  but they have about twice as many delegates
[3:41:18.600 --> 3:41:21.600]  needed for their overall convention.
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:23.600]  They got like 2,400 or whatever.
[3:41:23.600 --> 3:41:26.600]  There's about 1,200 that are needed to win for their Republicans.
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:28.600]  Bottom line is this.
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:31.600]  There are 150 superdelegates in the Republican Party.
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:32.600]  To put that in perspective,
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:36.600]  you've got 155 delegates in Texas.
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:40.600]  So the Republican Party takes the second largest state
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:42.600]  and reserves about that number of delegates.
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:44.600]  California has the most.
[3:41:44.600 --> 3:41:45.600]  They have 172.
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:48.600]  But think about big states like New York and Florida.
[3:41:48.600 --> 3:41:51.600]  They've got 95 in New York and 99 in Florida.
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:56.600]  The Republican Party reserves for itself 150 delegates.
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:41:58.600]  Now those are the party insiders.
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:01.600]  Those are going to be people who are going to support
[3:42:01.600 --> 3:42:03.600]  the establishment candidates.
[3:42:03.600 --> 3:42:06.600]  That's why Rubio is hanging in there.
[3:42:06.600 --> 3:42:08.600]  That's why he had a meeting in Manhattan
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:11.600]  where he had 200 donors come in
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:13.600]  and he said, well, our path to victory lies
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:15.600]  in a brokered convention.
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:17.600]  That's where this is all headed.
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:20.600]  But I wanted you to think about the fact that he's doing that.
[3:42:20.600 --> 3:42:22.600]  And for those of you who are listening to this,
[3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:24.600]  what Right's Prebis is doing,
[3:42:24.600 --> 3:42:27.600]  the head of the RNC is saying, no, no, they're joining us
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:29.600]  and he's gesturing with his arms.
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:31.600]  They're joining us.
[3:42:31.600 --> 3:42:33.600]  And I look at this and it's like,
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:36.600]  okay, we've got two sitting senators
[3:42:36.600 --> 3:42:38.600]  and we've got a sitting governor
[3:42:38.600 --> 3:42:42.600]  who I thought had already joined the Republican Party at some way.
[3:42:42.600 --> 3:42:44.600]  I don't really understand in what sense
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:47.600]  they are joining with us, okay?
[3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:51.600]  Is it some kind of a super elite, the secret club,
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:53.600]  like the elite hunting clubs or whatever,
[3:42:53.600 --> 3:42:55.600]  the elite Bohemian Grove.
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:42:58.600]  What is this that they are joining together with?
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:00.600]  I don't really understand.
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:03.600]  Does that mean that the debates are really nothing more
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:06.600]  than kind of a hazing contest for this elite fraternity
[3:43:06.600 --> 3:43:08.600]  that they're about to join this super secret thing?
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:11.600]  You got to go through the hazing process of the debates
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:13.600]  before you learn the secret handshake
[3:43:13.600 --> 3:43:16.600]  and join with the Prebis.
[3:43:16.600 --> 3:43:18.600]  What is this about?
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:21.600]  It was beyond strange, it was beyond creepy,
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:24.600]  but it illustrates what we are really up against.
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:27.600]  It illustrates, I think, how this thing is truly rigged.
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:30.600]  And if they do do something like this,
[3:43:30.600 --> 3:43:32.600]  if they shut down the voters,
[3:43:32.600 --> 3:43:35.600]  people are going to be really upset
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:38.600]  as Alex pointed out, it is going to be outright rebellion.
[3:43:38.600 --> 3:43:41.600]  That's what they have to really be concerned about.
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:44.600]  It looks now like Hillary Clinton is going to be able,
[3:43:44.600 --> 3:43:46.600]  with a popular vote, make the case
[3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:49.600]  and not have to throw her weight around with a super delegates.
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:52.600]  But if the GOP pulls some kind of thing like this,
[3:43:52.600 --> 3:43:54.600]  there is going to be a revolution.
[3:43:54.600 --> 3:43:57.600]  And we need to understand that these people have decided
[3:43:57.600 --> 3:44:00.600]  that this is their own little private club.
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:03.600]  If you've ever worked with a third party as I have,
[3:44:03.600 --> 3:44:06.600]  you understand how they have rigged this process
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:08.600]  from the ground up.
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:10.600]  They rigged ballot access,
[3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:13.600]  they rigged access to the debates for third parties,
[3:44:13.600 --> 3:44:16.600]  even when you jump through all the hoops for ballot access,
[3:44:16.600 --> 3:44:18.600]  you're still excluded from the debates.
[3:44:18.600 --> 3:44:21.600]  They do not want to have a different point of view in.
[3:44:21.600 --> 3:44:25.600]  That's what has been refreshing with the Donald Trump candidacy,
[3:44:25.600 --> 3:44:29.600]  the fact that he would come in and call Jed Bush on 9-11,
[3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:31.600]  the fact that he would talk about the missing pages
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:33.600]  of the classified report,
[3:44:33.600 --> 3:44:35.600]  the fact that he would talk about the fact
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:37.600]  that we were lied to with weapons of mass destruction.
[3:44:37.600 --> 3:44:40.600]  Can you imagine any other Republican candidate
[3:44:40.600 --> 3:44:43.600]  that we've had in my lifetime coming out and saying
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:46.600]  that a former Republican president had lied to people
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:48.600]  when it is clear?
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:49.600]  I mean, it's been admitted.
[3:44:49.600 --> 3:44:52.600]  They admitted that they lied to the American public.
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:54.600]  There's no question that we went to war with Iraq
[3:44:54.600 --> 3:44:56.600]  and we didn't have intelligence
[3:44:56.600 --> 3:44:57.600]  that they had weapons of mass destruction.
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:44:58.600]  That's not a question.
[3:44:58.600 --> 3:45:00.600]  That's a matter of historical record.
[3:45:00.600 --> 3:45:02.600]  But nobody else would say that.
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:05.600]  That is what I think is really important about this process.
[3:45:05.600 --> 3:45:07.600]  Let's go to one of your calls here.
[3:45:07.600 --> 3:45:09.600]  Let's go to Chris in Arizona.
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:13.600]  You had a question about Trump on the Apple FBI issue.
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:16.600]  I actually did.
[3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:18.600]  Hello, how are you today, Mr. Knight?
[3:45:18.600 --> 3:45:20.600]  Doing good. Go ahead.
[3:45:20.600 --> 3:45:25.600]  I had a question for Mr. Stone about why he thinks
[3:45:25.600 --> 3:45:29.600]  Trump sided with the FBI's Apple takeover.
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:31.600]  Well, he's not here now, so give us your take on it.
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:33.600]  Tell us what you think about it.
[3:45:33.600 --> 3:45:36.600]  Well, I think maybe somebody should have taken McAfee up
[3:45:36.600 --> 3:45:40.600]  on his offer to unlock the phone instead of giving
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:45.600]  the FBI complete backdoor access to every phone,
[3:45:45.600 --> 3:45:48.600]  every Apple phone that Apple has ever made.
[3:45:48.600 --> 3:45:50.600]  I think that is a very dangerous precedent.
[3:45:50.600 --> 3:45:54.600]  And we've already seen too much encroachment
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:45:56.600]  on our natural rights as citizens.
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:46:00.600]  And I think that maybe being a good friend of Mr. Trump,
[3:46:00.600 --> 3:46:05.600]  Mr. Stone should have maybe mentioned something to him
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:10.600]  about the dangers of giving the FBI that much power.
[3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:14.600]  We really should not be giving these people that much power.
[3:46:14.600 --> 3:46:16.600]  I agree. I think it is there.
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:19.600]  Simply, they're doing this simply to establish a precedent.
[3:46:19.600 --> 3:46:20.600]  And when I see the article saying,
[3:46:20.600 --> 3:46:23.600]  well, Apple gives this information to China,
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:25.600]  they're very malleable when it comes to China.
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:27.600]  We don't want to be China.
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:30.600]  China has the giant firewall.
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:32.600]  They have massive censorship and massive control
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:34.600]  of freedom of speech.
[3:46:34.600 --> 3:46:36.600]  They have access to everyone's data.
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:38.600]  We do not want to be China.
[3:46:38.600 --> 3:46:39.600]  If Apple wants to do business in China,
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:41.600]  they're going to play with that authoritarian regime.
[3:46:41.600 --> 3:46:44.600]  We need to understand that America is based
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:45.600]  on different principles,
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:47.600]  and we need to understand that our government
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:50.600]  is doing this now, what they're trying to do with this.
[3:46:50.600 --> 3:46:52.600]  And the way that they handle this is very clear
[3:46:52.600 --> 3:46:54.600]  what they did with Apple coming out first
[3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:56.600]  and talking about it in the press,
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:46:58.600]  saying that they were,
[3:46:58.600 --> 3:47:01.600]  Apple says that they learned about this first from the press
[3:47:01.600 --> 3:47:02.600]  rather than from the FBI.
[3:47:02.600 --> 3:47:03.600]  Let's understand.
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:06.600]  The FBI, the NSA, the government in general
[3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:09.600]  is violating the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment.
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:11.600]  They are violating laws.
[3:47:11.600 --> 3:47:12.600]  They're listening to us all the time
[3:47:12.600 --> 3:47:14.600]  with stingray devices and other issues.
[3:47:14.600 --> 3:47:18.600]  But they're trying to establish a legal precedent,
[3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:20.600]  trying to come out into the open,
[3:47:20.600 --> 3:47:22.600]  trying to say that this is going to be okay.
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:24.600]  We're going to pass laws, even though they violate
[3:47:24.600 --> 3:47:26.600]  the Constitution, we're going to pass laws
[3:47:26.600 --> 3:47:31.600]  to give them access to our information.
[3:47:31.600 --> 3:47:32.600]  That's what we need to fight.
[3:47:32.600 --> 3:47:33.600]  I absolutely agree with you.
[3:47:33.600 --> 3:47:35.600]  And I think that McAfee was making the point
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:38.600]  that this information could be gotten to.
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:39.600]  They did not have to do this.
[3:47:39.600 --> 3:47:42.600]  It was simply to establish a precedent.
[3:47:42.600 --> 3:47:44.600]  And again, as I said, there are issues like this
[3:47:44.600 --> 3:47:46.600]  in terms of our civil liberties
[3:47:46.600 --> 3:47:50.600]  that I think we're going to have to fight with other people
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:51.600]  other than anyone who's running for president.
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:52.600]  I don't see anybody.
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:47:54.600]  Did you see anybody that came out
[3:47:54.600 --> 3:47:56.600]  and had a position other than McAfee,
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:47:58.600]  who hasn't gotten the nomination yet
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:47:59.600]  for the Libertarian Party?
[3:47:59.600 --> 3:48:02.600]  Did you see anybody that came out and said,
[3:48:02.600 --> 3:48:05.600]  no, we're going to stop this?
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:06.600]  Chris.
[3:48:06.600 --> 3:48:08.600]  Yes, I'm still here.
[3:48:08.600 --> 3:48:09.600]  I'm sorry.
[3:48:09.600 --> 3:48:11.600]  I had you muted for half a second.
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:13.600]  My cell phone was ringing in the background.
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:14.600]  That's all right.
[3:48:14.600 --> 3:48:15.600]  Did you see anybody?
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:17.600]  I'm not aware of any presidential candidates,
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:19.600]  Republican or Democrat who have come out and said,
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:21.600]  you know, that's a bit too far for the FBI.
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:23.600]  They're simply trying to set up a legal precedent
[3:48:23.600 --> 3:48:25.600]  so that they're allowed to spy on us.
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:27.600]  Have you seen anybody say that?
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:29.600]  Yes, actually, John McAfee.
[3:48:29.600 --> 3:48:31.600]  Unfortunately, he's not very mainstream,
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:33.600]  and a lot of people don't know about him
[3:48:33.600 --> 3:48:35.600]  as far as running for office.
[3:48:35.600 --> 3:48:37.600]  I also had another question for Mr. Stone
[3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:41.600]  about his Mr. Trump's Republicans
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:45.600]  are stupid interview forever ago.
[3:48:45.600 --> 3:48:49.600]  And I was wondering how much of that
[3:48:49.600 --> 3:48:51.600]  he is now ashamed of
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:53.600]  and knowing that it's coming back to fight him.
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:48:55.600]  Was he talking about voters,
[3:48:55.600 --> 3:48:56.600]  or was he talking about politicians?
[3:48:56.600 --> 3:48:57.600]  I'm not familiar with the quote.
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:48:59.600]  He was talking about voters.
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:01.600]  How if he were to run for president,
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:03.600]  he would run as a Republican
[3:49:03.600 --> 3:49:05.600]  because Republicans are stupid
[3:49:05.600 --> 3:49:07.600]  and they'll pretty much vote for anybody.
[3:49:07.600 --> 3:49:09.600]  Well, I think that's true.
[3:49:09.600 --> 3:49:11.600]  I would agree with Donald Trump on that.
[3:49:11.600 --> 3:49:13.600]  If you look at what has happened,
[3:49:13.600 --> 3:49:15.600]  this is why I think the people
[3:49:15.600 --> 3:49:17.600]  who are flocking behind Ted Cruz
[3:49:17.600 --> 3:49:19.600]  are saying, well, we agree with him on principle.
[3:49:19.600 --> 3:49:23.600]  You have to understand that these guys have violated
[3:49:23.600 --> 3:49:26.600]  Mitch McConnell, especially Marco Rubio,
[3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:28.600]  working with a gang of eight when he ran
[3:49:28.600 --> 3:49:30.600]  for as a Tea Party candidate,
[3:49:30.600 --> 3:49:31.600]  saying he was going to control the border
[3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:34.600]  and then did everything he could to subvert that.
[3:49:34.600 --> 3:49:37.600]  Republicans have been led down the primrose path
[3:49:37.600 --> 3:49:41.600]  by politicians who have absolutely no interest
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:49:43.600]  in following through on their promises,
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:45.600]  and they do it again and again and again
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:46.600]  to the Republican voters.
[3:49:46.600 --> 3:49:48.600]  But I think the Republican voters this time
[3:49:48.600 --> 3:49:51.600]  have woken up because Republican voters
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:53.600]  are looking at different issues.
[3:49:53.600 --> 3:49:55.600]  They're looking at pragmatic issues.
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:49:58.600]  They're looking at things that they can do for themselves.
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:01.600]  I heard an evangelical pastor say,
[3:50:01.600 --> 3:50:03.600]  in terms of the people that he knew
[3:50:03.600 --> 3:50:04.600]  that were supporting Trump, he said,
[3:50:04.600 --> 3:50:06.600]  look, they're voting for this guy
[3:50:06.600 --> 3:50:09.600]  who clearly is not a very strong and knowledgeable Christian.
[3:50:09.600 --> 3:50:12.600]  He's tried to make overtures to the community,
[3:50:12.600 --> 3:50:13.600]  but they're not really buying that.
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:16.600]  What they're buying is the idea that they need somebody
[3:50:16.600 --> 3:50:18.600]  who is going to manage the economy,
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:20.600]  who is going to do these other things.
[3:50:20.600 --> 3:50:22.600]  And perhaps these things that they're looking at,
[3:50:22.600 --> 3:50:24.600]  they're not electing a pastor and chief.
[3:50:24.600 --> 3:50:27.600]  They need to be the ones who are out there
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:29.600]  practicing their religion in such a way
[3:50:29.600 --> 3:50:32.600]  that people understand who Christ is,
[3:50:32.600 --> 3:50:35.600]  not to elect somebody who is putting himself up
[3:50:35.600 --> 3:50:37.600]  as some kind of a phony revivalist.
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:40.600]  And I think that's what people are starting to wake up to.
[3:50:40.600 --> 3:50:42.600]  I think they realize that they've been had
[3:50:42.600 --> 3:50:45.600]  over and over again by people like Mitch McConnell
[3:50:45.600 --> 3:50:46.600]  and John Boehner.
[3:50:46.600 --> 3:50:48.600]  That's why they're saying we don't want that anymore.
[3:50:48.600 --> 3:50:50.600]  We want somebody that we can trust.
[3:50:50.600 --> 3:50:51.600]  And I think one of the things that we can do
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:50:55.600]  is go back and look at his long-term hot-button issues.
[3:50:55.600 --> 3:50:56.600]  And it was the economy.
[3:50:56.600 --> 3:50:58.600]  Stay with us. We're going to take some more of your calls.
[3:50:58.600 --> 3:51:01.600]  Are you sneezing, coughing, and aching?
[3:51:01.600 --> 3:51:04.600]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever, or the sniffles?
[3:51:04.600 --> 3:51:06.600]  There's no reason to be sick.
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:08.600]  It's cold and flu season with immune system support
[3:51:08.600 --> 3:51:10.600]  from Supernatural Silver.
[3:51:10.600 --> 3:51:13.600]  Supernatural Silver can give your body the help it needs

[3:51:22.600 --> 3:51:24.600]  and often leave behind bacteria

[3:54:11.600 --> 3:54:12.600]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:54:12.600 --> 3:54:14.600]  I'm David Knight, your host in this last segment.
[3:54:14.600 --> 3:54:16.600]  We're going to go to some more of our callers.
[3:54:16.600 --> 3:54:21.600]  And before we do, I just want to let you know that, of course, Monday is the 29th,
[3:54:21.600 --> 3:54:27.600]  February the 29th, and we're having a once every four year leap sale.
[3:54:27.600 --> 3:54:32.600]  30% off the entire store and free shipping on orders above $50.
[3:54:32.600 --> 3:54:34.600]  This only happens once every four years.
[3:54:34.600 --> 3:54:38.600]  30% off the entire store and free shipping.
[3:54:38.600 --> 3:54:42.600]  This is over this weekend as part of the leap year sale.
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:43.600]  Of course, we're going to have a big show on Monday.
[3:54:43.600 --> 3:54:46.600]  We're going to have some surprise guests that are going to be coming in.
[3:54:46.600 --> 3:54:50.600]  And I am sure there's going to be a lot of stuff that is going to be breaking
[3:54:50.600 --> 3:54:54.600]  in terms of negative dirty politics last minute stuff that always comes up
[3:54:54.600 --> 3:54:57.600]  before a big primary date, before the day before the election.
[3:54:57.600 --> 3:55:01.600]  We're going to have a lot of stuff hitting the fan.
[3:55:01.600 --> 3:55:04.600]  Probably starting Sunday, but definitely on Monday.
[3:55:04.600 --> 3:55:06.600]  Be ready, there's going to be a lot of dirty tricks.
[3:55:06.600 --> 3:55:09.600]  There's going to be an interesting day on Monday with our surprise guests,
[3:55:09.600 --> 3:55:13.600]  as well as the attacks that I know are going to be released.
[3:55:13.600 --> 3:55:15.600]  Let's go to some more of your calls here.
[3:55:15.600 --> 3:55:17.600]  Let's go to Ben in Florida.
[3:55:17.600 --> 3:55:19.600]  Ben?
[3:55:19.600 --> 3:55:21.600]  Hi, thanks so much for taking my call.
[3:55:21.600 --> 3:55:22.600]  I appreciate it.
[3:55:22.600 --> 3:55:25.600]  You hit the nail on the head when you were talking about the debate last night.
[3:55:25.600 --> 3:55:30.600]  Lost in all of the circus and the reality television show that are these Republican debates
[3:55:30.600 --> 3:55:32.600]  are the substantive issues.
[3:55:32.600 --> 3:55:34.600]  They never ask any good questions.
[3:55:34.600 --> 3:55:35.600]  It's always the same thing.
[3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:37.600]  Tell us your tax plan.
[3:55:37.600 --> 3:55:40.600]  What brackets and what percentages and the governors will say,
[3:55:40.600 --> 3:55:43.600]  I created more jobs than anybody in history and so forth and so on.
[3:55:43.600 --> 3:55:47.600]  That's the thing we hear every single four years and every single debate.
[3:55:47.600 --> 3:55:49.600]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:55:49.600 --> 3:55:50.600]  No, absolutely.
[3:55:50.600 --> 3:55:53.600]  And one thing that I'm dying to know about Mr. Knight is this.
[3:55:53.600 --> 3:55:56.600]  Where do these guys stand?
[3:55:56.600 --> 3:55:59.600]  All of these candidates stand on congressional term limits.
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:00.600]  We don't know.
[3:56:00.600 --> 3:56:02.600]  They never ask that question.
[3:56:02.600 --> 3:56:05.600]  Do you have any intel on where a guy like Mr. Trump might stand on that issue
[3:56:05.600 --> 3:56:08.600]  and how important do you think the issue is in your opinion?
[3:56:08.600 --> 3:56:10.600]  I don't know where he stands.
[3:56:10.600 --> 3:56:12.600]  I don't know where the others stand on that either.
[3:56:12.600 --> 3:56:16.600]  I remember when Newt Gingrich put together the contract with America
[3:56:16.600 --> 3:56:19.600]  and that was one of the tenants.
[3:56:19.600 --> 3:56:22.600]  It was the only one actually that they didn't enact, interestingly enough.
[3:56:22.600 --> 3:56:24.600]  They decided once they had a Republican landslide,
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:27.600]  they really didn't want term limits.
[3:56:27.600 --> 3:56:29.600]  I think term limits are good.
[3:56:29.600 --> 3:56:34.600]  We've tried multiple times to enact term limits in various ways.
[3:56:34.600 --> 3:56:38.600]  In the state of Virginia, there's a one term limit for the governor,
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:40.600]  a single term limit for the governor.
[3:56:40.600 --> 3:56:44.600]  The problem I have is that we've got a permanent political class.
[3:56:44.600 --> 3:56:46.600]  These guys come in, they stay in.
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:48.600]  Essentially, for life, once they get elected,
[3:56:48.600 --> 3:56:51.600]  it's very hard to get somebody out as an incumbent.
[3:56:51.600 --> 3:56:54.600]  Once they do get out, if they lose, they become a lobbyist.
[3:56:54.600 --> 3:56:56.600]  If they retire, they become a lobbyist.
[3:56:56.600 --> 3:56:57.600]  They get paid off.
[3:56:57.600 --> 3:57:03.600]  I'm even more concerned, however, about the lifetime appointments for the bureaucracy.
[3:57:03.600 --> 3:57:04.600]  Think about that.
[3:57:04.600 --> 3:57:08.600]  Everybody knows we have lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges.
[3:57:08.600 --> 3:57:11.600]  But once you get into these bureaucracies,
[3:57:11.600 --> 3:57:14.600]  which are essentially a government unto themselves,
[3:57:14.600 --> 3:57:17.600]  they legislate without ever being elected by us.
[3:57:17.600 --> 3:57:19.600]  So we've got legislation without representation.
[3:57:19.600 --> 3:57:23.600]  They come up with mandatory fines and civil fines,
[3:57:23.600 --> 3:57:25.600]  where they don't even have to take you to court,
[3:57:25.600 --> 3:57:27.600]  like this situation with the drone saying,
[3:57:27.600 --> 3:57:28.600]  you don't register with us.
[3:57:28.600 --> 3:57:29.600]  We find out about it.
[3:57:29.600 --> 3:57:33.600]  $27,500, actually, I think.
[3:57:33.600 --> 3:57:36.600]  $27,500 fine just for not registering with them.
[3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:38.600]  And they call that a civil action,
[3:57:38.600 --> 3:57:41.600]  just like civil asset forfeiture when they steal your car
[3:57:41.600 --> 3:57:43.600]  and don't accuse you of a crime,
[3:57:43.600 --> 3:57:45.600]  don't find you guilty of anything.
[3:57:45.600 --> 3:57:49.600]  So we have these bureaucracies that attacks us without representation.
[3:57:49.600 --> 3:57:51.600]  They legislate without representation.
[3:57:51.600 --> 3:57:54.600]  They are their own government entities,
[3:57:54.600 --> 3:57:56.600]  and these guys are essentially there for life.
[3:57:56.600 --> 3:57:58.600]  So if we're going to talk about term limits,
[3:57:58.600 --> 3:58:02.600]  let's talk about how are we going to even get Congress,
[3:58:02.600 --> 3:58:05.600]  in the first place, to exercise their authority.
[3:58:05.600 --> 3:58:07.600]  We want Congress to write the laws.
[3:58:07.600 --> 3:58:09.600]  We want Congress to pass the budgets,
[3:58:09.600 --> 3:58:14.600]  not have these out of control permanently entrenched bureaucracies.
[3:58:14.600 --> 3:58:17.600]  Of course, Rand Paul has tried to put in the Reigns Act
[3:58:17.600 --> 3:58:19.600]  and other things that has tried to address that issue.
[3:58:19.600 --> 3:58:21.600]  I hope it does get addressed by Congress,
[3:58:21.600 --> 3:58:24.600]  but we have to get people who are going to do the job
[3:58:24.600 --> 3:58:26.600]  rather than abdicate their power.
[3:58:26.600 --> 3:58:27.600]  Thanks for joining us.
[3:58:27.600 --> 3:58:29.600]  Join us tonight at 7 Central,
[3:58:29.600 --> 3:58:39.600]  8 p.m. Eastern for the Nightly News.
