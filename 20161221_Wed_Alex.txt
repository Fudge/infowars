[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday the 21st of December 2016. I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07.000 --> 00:15.000]  What type of evil heart seeks to attack something as pure and good and beautiful as Christmas?
[00:15.000 --> 00:23.000]  What type of demon sees happy families and smiling faces as a threat and decides to smash a truck into it?
[00:23.000 --> 00:34.000]  What type of evil is drawn out of its spider hole to attack smiling families dancing under the stars around Christmas trees?
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.000]  What type of serpent is conjured by Christmas carols and prays to Jesus Christ?
[00:41.000 --> 01:01.000]  And what type of evil knowingly brings this cancer into the midst of the people and then protects it, then lies for it and even finances it?
[01:01.000 --> 01:17.000]  As we approach the twilight of 2016, I personally am reflecting on the historical, the magical things that have happened in the last year.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  We have seen a global awakening to the corporate planetary tyranny that was being established.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  We have seen nations across the world begin to pull out of the unelected globalist system.
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  We have seen human self-determination spring back to life like the mythical phoenix.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  I am so honored to be able to speak to you every day. I am so honored to be able to talk to you and your families.
[01:43.000 --> 01:52.000]  I am humbled by the fact that infall wars is such a critical part of the fight against the globalist and the fact that we're beginning to turn the tide.
[01:52.000 --> 02:02.000]  I always want to make the point that it's you that is the lifeblood, the core of what we're doing, because you really are the key to everything.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  You have the light of God in your eyes. You're made the image of the Creator.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  And that's what this Christmas is all about, is remembering our Lord the Savior, Jesus Christ.
[02:12.000 --> 02:21.000]  That's why the jihadis controlled by the globalist have been turned loose and brought into Europe to attack viciously and drive us into submission.
[02:21.000 --> 02:30.000]  The social engineers admit they're going to bring in political correctness that are already doing it to say that we have no free speech because we're the ones that are causing the Islamist to attack us.
[02:30.000 --> 02:40.000]  Obama, when there was a stabbing attack of nine people, and he was running over people with cars in Ohio State, came out the day after and said, this is not Islam.
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  So-called liberals came out and said that he should have been shot by police as he ran towards them with a knife after stabbing nine people.
[02:47.000 --> 02:56.000]  They tell us the attacks in Germany and the attacks in France with trucks running over people at Christmas parties and national anthem events isn't as long.
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  They talk to us like we're idiots. But we all know the globalists are against Christmas and against any other system of Western culture.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  That's why at colleges and high schools and elementary schools across the nation, Christmas has been banned.
[03:11.000 --> 03:20.000]  They're banning the word holiday. They're even telling students they can't pass out Christmas cards. That's your free speech.
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  Separation of church and state means we don't have a state-run religion. Doesn't mean we don't have free speech.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  But we do have a state-run religion now, and it's called political correctness.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  And it's a cult that's antithetical to our Western society and culture.
[03:35.000 --> 03:47.000]  Christianity and our Judeo-Christian roots is the heart of common law and the civilization we've built while not perfect is heads above any other system.
[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  In the freedom it delivers, in the choice it delivers, in the security it delivers, in the love and compassion it delivers.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  It's the West in Christianity that ended slavery worldwide. It's the West in Christianity that brought forward women's suffrage.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  It's the West in Christianity that we have to thank for everything we've got good today.
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  And it's important for us to get on the offensive to the globalist and the fake feminist and the other social engineers that seek to make us weak.
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  It's time to embrace again what made us strong. It's time to realize that we do have destiny. We do have providence.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  And that's why these snakes of the earth attack that.
[04:27.000 --> 04:35.000]  So for this Christmas season, I want to salute all of you of every race, color, and creed who are of the human race,
[04:35.000 --> 04:43.000]  and invite you to join us in celebration of Christmas, even if you're not a Christian, in defense of free speech,
[04:43.000 --> 04:54.000]  and in defense of Western civilization, in defense of beauty, in defense of families, in defense of free association and free will.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  Merry Christmas to all.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.000]  Social media platforms are coming under fire as families of the Orlando nightclub shooting victims are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[05:06.000 --> 05:12.000]  And the federal complaint argues that these web platforms, quote, provided terrorist group support for ISIS,
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  and the accounts they used to spread extremist propaganda.
[05:15.000 --> 05:22.000]  The families of these victims of the Orlando gay nightclub shooting on Monday this week filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook, and Google
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  for allegedly providing, quote, material support to ISIS, and helping them radicalize shooter Omar Mateen.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  In this complaint, it was filed in the Eastern District of Michigan.
[05:31.000 --> 05:39.000]  The families of Tevin Crosby, Javier George Reyes, and Juan Ray Moguero, they argue that the three web platforms provided the terrorist group ISIS
[05:39.000 --> 05:46.000]  with accounts they used to spread extremist propaganda, raise funds, and attract new recruits like Omar Mateen.
[05:46.000 --> 05:53.000]  Now, we've seen Facebook comment or fire recently for censoring real news, but it looks like they're giving a platform to ISIS,
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  and victims' families are saying no more.
[05:55.000 --> 06:17.000]  For more, I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.

[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  We have dealt vicious debt blows to world government and the corporate crime syndicate's plans.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  Thank you for joining us for this worldwide transmission.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  Wednesday, the 21st day of December, 2016.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and this is The Infowar.
[08:42.000 --> 08:51.000]  The epic struggle against the New World Order anti-human crime syndicate is now going into high gear.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  Our attacks against the global escum are only going to intensify.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  Get ready and get used to victory.
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  The theme of 2016 has been the triumph of individual will coming together for destiny.
[09:15.000 --> 09:24.000]  On our side, on the enemy side, it has been one of abject delusion and arrogance.
[09:24.000 --> 09:34.000]  The enemy's confidence is one of its greatest weaknesses, and they're about to learn that in spades.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  Where do we begin today? There is so much to cover.
[09:37.000 --> 09:46.000]  Michelle Obama has crawled out from under her White House rock to join Oprah, the poor victim that's made billions in America,
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  embraced by White America, pushing her race-baiting garbage.
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.000]  Michelle Obama compares Americans to toddlers.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  She says toddlers hit their head, and then you're sad for them.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  We're going to play that clip coming up that we're dumb.
[10:02.000 --> 10:12.000]  We're like year-and-a-half, two-year-olds or so, 18-month-olds, two-month-olds, stumbling around, falling down when we voted for Trump.
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  I thought the Russians stole the election. I thought the FBI did it.
[10:16.000 --> 10:25.000]  Oh, now we're toddlers, Michelle, and of course Michelle and Obama and the Clintons and others are saying that Trump can't run a government.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  No, no, he's not a community organizer that never worked today in his life.
[10:29.000 --> 10:38.000]  He's not Michael Moore that kind of hops around and makes some half-ass made-for-TV movies and, you know, has six bodyguards with guns but says we can't have guns.
[10:38.000 --> 10:48.000]  No, no, no, he started his own business as one of the most successful real estate moguls in the world, has absolutely dominated in television, dominated with his books and publications.
[10:48.000 --> 11:05.000]  He's just dominated against the total New World Order media spin machine and both political parties and foreign money flooding into stopping and he's a loser that doesn't know how to captain the republic.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  And now they're talking about, oh, this venture he did was a failure, that venture.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  Trump has set up, I looked it up, over 400 corporations in his life.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  By the way, I've set up more than 30 and of course the public doesn't business thinks that's a dirty word.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  No, there are some corrupt big out of control globalist corporations funding a takeover.
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  We're fighting them, but a corporation is just a venture so that individuals don't have liability if it falls apart to a certain extent.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  Every time I made a film, I went out and got insurance on it.
[11:38.000 --> 11:47.000]  Every time I did errors and omissions insurance, every time I would set up a corporation at least once I'd made four or five of them and knew what I was doing,
[11:47.000 --> 11:57.000]  show that I would make the investment on a film that might cost me $300, $400,000 and then if it failed, the rest of my fledgling operation wouldn't go under.
[11:57.000 --> 12:06.000]  And Trump has declared bankruptcy three times out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of successful ventures.
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  You know in small businesses roughly 80% fail, you know that right.
[12:12.000 --> 12:22.000]  And the top people in business out there will tell you they have failed over and over and over again coming up short, but finally making it.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  They might fail three or four times and then make it.
[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  They might lose everything and then gain it back in the next venture or maybe five ventures later.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  I personally have only had a few ventures fail. Most people have had many, but again, they target the public.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  Most people work for somebody else. They don't know now.
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  They've taken the greatest nation of entrepreneurs and inverted that or a nation of debtors, a nation of people working for other folks.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  And now they make it some type of weakness that Trump declared bankruptcy three times.
[12:53.000 --> 13:01.000]  No, the venture failed. He would declare bankruptcy on those debts. You can part mentalize your debts. You don't put them all in one basket.
[13:01.000 --> 13:08.000]  Just what Trump wants to do on trade deals, not some mega massive 20,000 page secret agreement that transfers power.
[13:08.000 --> 13:16.000]  We're going to do deals one at a time. One at a time. That's how you get the best deals.
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  You're ever in business. Somebody's got some big, giant, complex deal that's going to be the best thing ever. You better run, not walk.
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.000]  And what has Trump done? Michelle, as you say, he's the biggest booby on the block.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  By the way, for our Christian conservative audience, that doesn't mean breast.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  Booby is the name of South China Sea Pirates.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  That's where we get the term of, you look like a bunch of boobies if you're not dressed conservatively.
[13:43.000 --> 13:59.000]  U.S. economic confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup in a hundred plus years has ever recorded.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  And they're already announcing they're going to raise interest rates.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  I've already done it once to try to stall this.
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  I've been critical of the low interest rates because it's impossible to fix things in a non-growth economy with zero interest rates.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  If you're going to have zero and turn the economy on, it's the way to go for at least three years.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  Then you better back off because it will blow like a bubble.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  But to get us out of cardiac arrest, put those affibrillators on us, Trump, zero, zero is what we need.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  Under old stuff, we needed to raise interest rates.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  That would at least give investors, small-time investors, a chance to get something going and people that have money, they're saving some type of return.
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  But now, that it's not just globalists going to give themselves all those zero percent money.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  It's time for the people to get some of that, and Trump wants to keep it low.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  They say, oh, the economy's overheating.
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  Trump's been president-elect for 40 days.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  He'll be in at 29, and we can't allow it overheating.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  So we're just going to have to raise it maybe two or three more times before he gets in, hoping it ends this Trump run.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  That's not going to work because there's over a trillion dollars conservatively.
[15:01.000 --> 15:11.000]  That's public, a lot more in foreign bank accounts in the Bahamas, in Spain, in Luxembourg, in Monte Carlo, and obviously many other places.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  But all the public money's over a trill that wants to come back.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  And as soon as we cut that corporate income tax, which has got to be his number one mission, to the global average,
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  instead of being the highest of any major nation, because, you know, fact check will go, well, there are a few countries that have higher.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  Yeah, but of big, wealthy nations, we are 15 points above the average.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  Trump wants to go below, which, by the way, is a trade war.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  I kind of like that idea. We've been getting screwed by China so long. Let's go ahead. They're getting pushy.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  They're grabbing our submarines. They're getting their shooting their mouths off.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  How about we go five points below them?
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.000]  But Congress is ready to vote right now to equalize it. Totally fair.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  Heritage Foundation says, if we don't have higher taxes than other people, it's not fair.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  No, no, that's a screw job. In fact, I had a libertarian guy from Vice.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  Go, you're not being free market wanting to lower the income tax on corporations.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  And I went, wait a minute. If China's got a 15% higher, how is it not fair to lower it to the same amount?
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  He goes, I guess you got a point. I said, yeah, man, stop spewing Heritage Foundation stuff at me, please, please.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  Well, it's kind of, you know, crony capitalist to, you know, do deals just for America.
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  We've been having it one sided forever. It's not crony capitalism.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  Crony capitalism is not letting us compete so we can be controlled. It's ending.
[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  That's why they're so mad. The globalists have been selling off this country and talking about what geniuses they are for decades.
[16:38.000 --> 16:48.000]  No, what you are is a bunch of backstabbing traders that sold out the country that had over half the world's wealth till you got control of it.
[16:48.000 --> 16:57.000]  Oh yeah, comprende that. U.S. economic confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded.
[16:57.000 --> 17:06.000]  Infowars.com Michael Schneider article. Gallup's U.S. economic confidence index has never been higher than it is today.
[17:06.000 --> 17:14.000]  That's the Trump euphoria. People always say, oh, Wall Street's pure evil on the left, on the right.
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.000]  Wall Street can do no wrong. No, big mega banks and big brokerage firms that are above the law pushing uncontroll, pushing globalism,
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  pushing, transferring our sovereignty and international bodies, they control, is conquest, is crony capitalism, is wrong.
[17:29.000 --> 17:39.000]  But most of Wall Street is middle and small time firms and even some big ones that are family owned, controlled that do want prosperity and they're doubling down on Trump.
[17:39.000 --> 17:49.000]  They want the prosperity. They want the boom. They want the tax cuts and the word is Trump's going to free spending in the first year just to stabilize things
[17:49.000 --> 17:56.000]  and he is intending by year four to begin cutting. And by the way, what he wants to do, he's going to try. This isn't talk.
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  You're going to see if he gets his way and we get behind him.
[17:59.000 --> 18:09.000]  Cutting, spending moderately, it's not going to be big. Because we're totally, I mean, even Ron Paul says we got to wean off this.
[18:09.000 --> 18:20.000]  Cutting, spending while revenue swells for building projects. And of course, Krugman is flipping out today saying this is an administration of white nationalists
[18:20.000 --> 18:29.000]  and we don't need make work projects and infrastructure because it looks like he's hiring people that are going to privatize.
[18:29.000 --> 18:36.000]  That's what you've been doing, Trump. Giving the contracts to private companies is how we're going to get the jobs going.
[18:36.000 --> 18:46.000]  Not just shipping and overseas or paying off debts that don't exist. All these monolithic fiat derivatives debts that should just be triaged.
[18:46.000 --> 18:57.000]  The U.S. economic confidence surges the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded. Gallup's U.S. economic confidence in sex has never been higher than it is today.
[18:57.000 --> 19:04.000]  And if folks, everything is confidence, we have the economy, we can rebuild it, we can do it, but not if they sabotage it.
[19:04.000 --> 19:12.000]  And if Trump gets sabotaged or they kill him or they bring up more scandals and start an impeachment as the New York Times called for yesterday,
[19:12.000 --> 19:22.000]  the day after he beat them trying to overturn the electors, then we all can look in the mirror for why we didn't turn this country around.
[19:22.000 --> 19:28.000]  Trump euphoria is being called. We're going to come back and break all this down straight ahead. This is exciting.
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  And it's what he and Bannon promised to do. It's Bannon's plan. Trump's plan as well. It's the Americana plan.
[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  It always worked. It threatened the whole planet. It was run by dictators and scum because everybody said, hey, can't we be like that?
[19:41.000 --> 19:50.000]  We're about to turn loose the American worker, the American entrepreneur, every race, color and creed who bleed red blood on terra firma.
[19:50.000 --> 20:19.000]  This is a big transmission. I'm wound up and I'm coming out of the gate hot straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones.

There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them. It's called heart and body extract.

[21:22.000 --> 21:32.000]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[21:32.000 --> 21:42.000]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries. It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic stuff.

[23:53.000 --> 23:59.000]  The Original Diamond Gusset Gene
[24:23.000 --> 24:31.000]  I want to wish you all a wonderful Christmas.
[24:31.000 --> 24:44.000]  I wish all the Christians out there a great holiday as well and hope that you will remember that your establishment run churches are helping subvert this country and keep Christians from actually taking action against evil.
[24:44.000 --> 24:51.000]  If you're in a church, it's actually fighting the new world order and fighting the abortuaries and you're a lucky person, you're blessed.
[24:51.000 --> 24:59.000]  A lot of them are state run now and they should be recognized as the abode of devils that they are in my humble opinion.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  Behind me if you're watching on television is the image of the Christmas tree down by the state capitol here in Austin, Texas where we originate from.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  Very, very beautiful.
[25:08.000 --> 25:27.000]  You've got to realize that evil people scum, the fascistic left, the authoritarian control freak oligarchs, the jihadis, the orthodox Islamists all over the world from Syria to Iraq to the United States to Europe are attacking blowing up Christmas trees,
[25:27.000 --> 25:39.000]  stabbing people, running over children with cars and I've got stacks of news and videos here. We're CNN, MS, NBC and everybody else is defending the attacks in Europe,
[25:39.000 --> 25:52.000]  saying that basically the Russian ambassador deserved to die because of Aleppo and that Germany's done bad things to the Muslims so they deserve it and that it's not Muslims.
[25:52.000 --> 26:03.000]  In fact, Chris Hayes and others are saying this is not a jihad attack. MS, NBC's Chris Hayes works double time to make Berlin and Turkey attacks not seem like terrorism.
[26:03.000 --> 26:17.000]  That's coming up. If you go to drudgereport.com you can see the headline Berlin manhunt as killer escapes Europe on Xmas alert and he is a Islamist of course just like the other suspect was and he's trying to flee Europe.
[26:17.000 --> 26:27.000]  They're reporting and they're blurring out his face. The police released and the government released an image of him and the media, I guess, blurred it out.
[26:27.000 --> 26:35.000]  So Paul Watson's been asking on Twitter why they're blurring out his face. We're not blurring out his face. Most wanted. He was the guy that had the truck was the driver.
[26:35.000 --> 26:47.000]  Police revealed they are hunting here. Let's scroll down and read his name. Anas or is that Anas Amir? Anas Amir. Like that is Anas Amir. What a nice name.
[26:47.000 --> 26:56.000]  Anas Amir. That's A-N-I-S. Anas Amir. 23. Just look at that guy. He just looks like he's mentally ill.
[26:56.000 --> 27:06.000]  But he stood up. He stood up to the evil Germans out drinking hot chocolate and eggnog under Christmas trees with their kids. He reportedly allegedly ran over them.
[27:06.000 --> 27:17.000]  He's the guy identified as the person in the truck, had the truck, was the truck driver. So the media seized on with all the police had the wrong guy, refugee there in the country.
[27:17.000 --> 27:28.000]  Oh wait, it's another one. Well, let's just move along. Because we need to have armed guards around Christmas displays around the country.
[27:28.000 --> 27:41.000]  Like the guy that wanted to blow up a Christmas tree in Portland. Then the FBI was ordered not to stop him. But then they basically bucked the orders and did.
[27:41.000 --> 27:47.000]  So that'd be a false flag on top, letting him attack when the FBI actually does their job and stops it. It's no longer a false flag.
[27:47.000 --> 27:57.000]  A lot of the type of false flags. A false flag is not just a pure attack. When our government opens the borders up and lets these people in, unvetted, that is Obama, he is then aiding and abetting in an attack on our country.
[27:57.000 --> 28:04.000]  That is a false flag by the globalist. But it's our own government that is actually at the grassroots level trying to fight it and expose it.
[28:04.000 --> 28:12.000]  When I had advice here yesterday for HBO, they were doing paradoxes. Well, wait, you say that there's Islamic terrorism, but you're then saying the government's behind it.
[28:12.000 --> 28:23.000]  And I'm saying criminals in our government are allied with it. The Pentagon believes that the CIA is a Wahhabist. He certainly lived in Saudi Arabia off and on for two decades.
[28:23.000 --> 28:34.000]  Brennan. And nobody else is saying the Russians were involved in the election, but him and then giving no proof. It's just a little side issue.
[28:34.000 --> 28:43.000]  But before I get into all this and a bunch of clips in the next segment, how big a deal is it that they had all these fake polls, tried to steal the election?
[28:43.000 --> 28:52.000]  Trump still had a big victory. They claim he lost the popular vote, but they admit that they've got illegals voting all over the country and people voting in the name of dead people.
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  Safe to say Trump won that as well. But look at the reality, 30, 40, 50,000 people at crowds, Hillary with 300.
[28:59.000 --> 29:07.000]  And now Trump keeps going up in popularity in Gallup. And you know it's a lot higher than even what they're saying on how they go for demographics.
[29:07.000 --> 29:20.000]  And then now the highest economic outlook, the highest confidence ever. Restaurants have gone from almost closing to saying they're busting at the seams.
[29:20.000 --> 29:32.000]  Suddenly factory orders, all sorts of stuff's happening. 60 billion in jobs already coming back from high tech to oil drilling to steel manufacturing.
[29:32.000 --> 29:42.000]  And just a surge of it's okay to be patriotic again. It's okay to want to buy American again. And I'm telling you, I'm thinking about doing what Salinte was saying.
[29:42.000 --> 29:48.000]  I'm thinking about getting with it and factory here in the U.S. and putting on American made shoes or something. I want to jump on the bandwagon.
[29:48.000 --> 29:58.000]  Because we actually created the bandwagon. You know what I mean? This is exciting. We should all pile on, make America great again. Ha ha ha, yeah.
[30:18.000 --> 30:26.000]  On Monday this week, filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook, and Google for allegedly providing, quote, material support to ISIS.
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.000]  And helping them radicalize shooter Omar Mateen in this complaint. It was filed in the Eastern District of Michigan.
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  The families of Tevin Crosby, Javier George Reyes, and Juan Remo Guero.
[30:36.000 --> 30:47.000]  They argue that the three web platforms provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts they used to spread extremist propaganda, raise funds and attract new recruits like Omar Mateen.
[30:47.000 --> 30:55.000]  Now we've seen Facebook comment or fire recently for censoring real news, but it looks like they're giving a platform to ISIS and victims families are saying no more.
[30:55.000 --> 31:24.000]  I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com.
[31:26.000 --> 31:41.000]  Or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work.
[31:41.000 --> 31:51.000]  You need to check out InfowarsTeam.com. Give your body the gift of good nutrition. Head over to InfowarsTeam.com. Your body will be very grateful.
[31:51.000 --> 31:57.000]  On the web at InfowarsTeam.com. That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[32:21.000 --> 32:28.000]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[32:51.000 --> 32:58.000]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[33:21.000 --> 33:26.000]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[33:52.000 --> 34:02.000]  Hard to believe we're about to be in 2017, and the Infowars Anti-Globalist Americana era begins.
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.000]  We're going to have to fight for it. Make no mistake.
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.000]  But hey, Americans love to fight, don't we? And we love to win.
[34:15.000 --> 34:23.000]  And I got to tell you, I'm never going to get sick of winning. I'm never going to get sick of fighting.
[34:23.000 --> 34:33.000]  And I've come here to kick-ass the chew bubblegum and quote the immortal Rowdy Piper, I'm all out of bubblegum.
[34:33.000 --> 34:43.000]  Nothing, except the good Lord above, can stop human ingenuity, human drive, human will, human passion, human love
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.000]  when we have a focus and know it's for our species.
[34:48.000 --> 34:55.000]  And that's why the globalists have done everything they can to demoralize us and make us feel weak.
[34:55.000 --> 35:06.000]  We're breaking their will now, and they can feel it economically, culturally, and spiritually most important.
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  Alright, let me just calm down and get to all this news because it is just over the top important.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  Let me know where to start.
[35:16.000 --> 35:24.000]  Let me just set the table with how the enemy is trying to break our will and how they're now having to reverse themselves more and more.
[35:24.000 --> 35:36.000]  Chris Hayes has come out and tried to whitewash the Islamic terror, hitting Christmas parties, hitting the Russian ambassador and others in Europe.
[35:36.000 --> 35:49.000]  They're also trying to triple down on the race spading to put minority groups and whites and others into their own little boxes to fear each other
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  and to politically not come together around prosperity and populism.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  It is a desperate attempt at sabotage, and they admit that it's not working.
[35:57.000 --> 36:21.000]  Yesterday MTV put up a super hardcore racist message that we're going to be playing here today that is resolutions for white guys.
[36:21.000 --> 36:36.000]  Now they've had former videos on this same show where they say, attention white guys, and they say you've caused the murder, you've caused the criminality, you are the bad people in the world.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  Despite the fact that history doesn't show that.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  In the sum, it shows the opposite.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  It's just with modern technology, the death tolls have been higher.
[36:46.000 --> 36:54.000]  The highest death tolls of any population have been committed by the Chinese communists, and throughout history, it's been committed by the Chinese.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  The Chinese are the all time biggest killers of their own people.
[37:00.000 --> 37:06.000]  It's over 100 million since 1949 when Mao took over all of China.
[37:06.000 --> 37:16.000]  Testimony probably killed about 10 million Chinese before that. We're talking well over 100 million.
[37:16.000 --> 37:26.000]  We'd like me to walk through what's happened in other places where non-Anglos engage in mass murder of their own people or wars, I'd be more than happy to.
[37:26.000 --> 37:40.000]  But MTV publicly shames whites and under psychology, it shows them apologizing for what they've done to America and apologizing for things their ancestors didn't even do.
[37:40.000 --> 37:52.000]  Total mental illness, but now MTV went too far with the weaponization and Sumner Redstone's anti-American operation had to pull back.
[37:52.000 --> 38:05.000]  That's coming up in a moment as well. They have expunged this, but under fair use, under the public's right to know, the weaponized media being targeted, we have the video.
[38:05.000 --> 38:13.000]  We're going to be playing that in a moment, but understand this, we've got 12 dead, 60-plus injured, others may die, unfortunately.
[38:13.000 --> 38:25.000]  In Berlin, we've got 89 dead in Nice, hundreds injured, and we had media back then that for a week wouldn't say it was Islamic attack.
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.000]  They called it a truck attack. Here they had to admit it very, very early because witnesses said they saw Middle Eastern looking guy get out of it and run off.
[38:33.000 --> 38:43.000]  They grabbed another illegal invader, they let him go after 20 hours interrogation, and now they said they have the name of the guy and the identity and the face of who did it.
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  And I covered that earlier, we could put that on screen, but the media is blurring out his face hoping he doesn't get caught.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  Tunisian asylum seeker 23 suspected of carrying out Berlin massacre was arrested three times this year.
[38:56.000 --> 39:05.000]  I'm at fear as he was planning a terror plot, but police let him go and are now offering 100,000 euros to anyone who finds him.
[39:05.000 --> 39:13.000]  And there he is, his name is Anas Amir. Actually, it's Anas Amir. He shouldn't insult Anas's.
[39:13.000 --> 39:20.000]  There's some beautiful butts out there a lot better looking than his face. I've got to tell you, I've seen horses' asses that look better than him.
[39:20.000 --> 39:26.000]  He actually looks like a deformed elephant butt. Maybe his mother was an elephant.
[39:26.000 --> 39:35.000]  The point is people are sick. In fact, let's trigger everybody that's watching that's not a patriot or who's living in some mind control cult.
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.000]  Let's put up the Texas Christmas tree. Well, we can put him up there too. What a little wimp.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  He didn't go attack a military target, he didn't go attack men.
[39:44.000 --> 39:51.000]  He ran over a bunch of people at a Christmas party outdoors under the stars, just another coward.
[39:51.000 --> 40:02.000]  Like his brother and ran over the three-year-olds running, screaming, mommy, mommy, direct shades of Mad Max.
[40:02.000 --> 40:12.000]  And everyone in Europe is wondering why this happened. We bring you here, we give everything free, we throw out old Germans out of their Section 8 housing.
[40:12.000 --> 40:22.000]  In Italy, they're throwing people out of hospital beds and out of hotels to house all the beautiful, chosen people of Islam.
[40:22.000 --> 40:30.000]  Oh, and where's the outrage of Islam? There's a big article out of the Southern Poverty Law Center that, by the way, law enforcement for five years doesn't even use anymore,
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  because they got caught running Elohim sitting in other operations.
[40:34.000 --> 40:44.000]  The law enforcement knows who they are now. They say General Flynn, former head of Defense Intelligence, who exposed the al-Qaeda ISIS system,
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.000]  Obama and Hillary were running, and he helped stop it. Super smart guy, was sort of a show, obviously, they know that.
[40:51.000 --> 41:00.000]  He tweets our stuff, leave it at that. They keep calling him a kook and a weirdo, and then they say, he says Islam will not coexist with us
[41:00.000 --> 41:08.000]  and he's trying to take over. He said it's rational to fear Islam. He said Islam, they quote stuff like he's discredited,
[41:08.000 --> 41:20.000]  and this is stuff he said years ago, some of it a decade ago, and all of it is coming true. He said Europe will not be Europe by 2050.
[41:20.000 --> 41:31.000]  This is the kind of stuff he says, it's like General Flynn said that the sky is blue. General Flynn said fish live in the water.
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  General Flynn said grass is green. General Flynn said Rudolph has a red nose. General Flynn said Superman has a red cape.
[41:37.000 --> 41:46.000]  General Flynn said bicycles have two wheels. What a kook. It's like you read their thing about me.
[41:46.000 --> 41:54.000]  General Flynn says there's a plan to open the borders and bring in world government. It's been announced, it's done.
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  But they have to take what's normal, it's psychological warfare, totally normal, totally admitted and go, look at this, this is insane,
[42:00.000 --> 42:08.000]  so you're scared to say it. Why, you might get put on the list, the southern poverty law center might attack you.
[42:08.000 --> 42:16.000]  You might have to change your place. Well, might readjust his glasses to make him look like a professor.
[42:16.000 --> 42:24.000]  Why don't you adjust my glasses here? Like, if somebody get me a pair of glasses and a pipe, somebody will get me a pair of reading glasses,
[42:24.000 --> 42:32.000]  and they kind of look professorly, and a pipe from the local drug store, they sell them behind the counter.
[42:32.000 --> 42:39.000]  In fact, I even want some tobacco, some cherry flavored tobacco for Christmas. I'm going to center like Chris Hayes.
[42:39.000 --> 42:49.000]  Let me light my lighter. There's no Islam here. It'd be like walking up the Taj Mahal and going, I don't see the Taj Mahal here.
[42:49.000 --> 42:56.000]  Where is it? It's like right in front of you. We're watching us on TV right now. I don't see a Christmas tree here.
[42:56.000 --> 43:08.000]  Where could it be? Hmm, nowhere here. Oh, Chris Hayes, you're so intellectual. You're so metrosexual.
[43:08.000 --> 43:15.000]  They can't tell who's male, who's female. You're so modern. Matt Hall looks like more of a man than you.
[43:15.000 --> 43:24.000]  Chris Hayes, sustained effort to demonize Trump, no matter how deranged, is the path back to power for Democrats.
[43:24.000 --> 43:31.000]  Now, he always looks like he's drunk about three bottles of cough syrup. I'm Chris Hayes going to sleep here.
[43:31.000 --> 43:38.000]  But let's go ahead and play Chris Hayes. Then we'll get to the new MTV video they pulled. They don't want you to see.
[43:38.000 --> 43:48.000]  Where they're actually hyping up. Notice it's always led by white people. I've actually found it's not really on average blacks and Hispanics that are running around all this racist crap.
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.000]  In fact, I've seen them in the real world just kind of go, this is crazy. What are they trying to create? Racism? Absolutely.
[43:54.000 --> 44:05.000]  Because weaker minded white people watch this and go join the KKK. I mean, this is crazy town, folks.
[44:05.000 --> 44:13.000]  You are bad because you're white, you're horrible, and you're weird, and you can't play sports, and you're pathetic, and you can't sing, and you can't dance.
[44:13.000 --> 44:26.000]  This is all Hollywood. Whites are scum, whites are bad, whites are out of style, whites are terrible, whites are the worst thing in the world, even though white people are number 16 or 17, depending on the year, on the economic chart.
[44:26.000 --> 44:47.000]  Up at the top is Christian, folks from the Middle East, and then you move on down from there, Lebanese particularly, that it's Chinese, and Vietnamese, and Koreans, and on and on and on, and then way down here, white people, then black people.
[44:47.000 --> 44:56.000]  Hispanics aren't as high up as they should be, because on average, it's well known demographic, it's not a cliche, it's called a number. Don't trust banks, don't trust vaccines, don't trust the police or whatever.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  You always hear the government bemoaning that, that's why I mentioned it, they don't put their money in banks, but Hispanics are doing quite well as well.
[45:01.000 --> 45:16.000]  Probably better on average than a lot of whites now, because whites were the dominant economic force, and it was all the work ethic that's been taken out, and the demographics show whites are nose diving since the 80s, like black started nose diving in the 60s.
[45:16.000 --> 45:33.000]  So, whites are down the rat hole, thanks to social engineering. Social engineering works on people, folks, worked really good on black people, they had lower illegitimacy until the 50s than white people.
[45:33.000 --> 45:47.000]  Now it's upwards of 80%, some areas 90 plus percent. Whites are now pushing 40%, than single digits in the 50s, and I'm not attacking single families, they always go, what are you attacking single families?
[45:47.000 --> 46:00.000]  Absolutely not, there's some great fathers and mothers that single parents do an incredible job. The point is, statistically, it is a wrecking ball, but though the state can raise your kids now, don't worry, yes they do such a great job.
[46:00.000 --> 46:14.000]  But you read the stuff where General Flynn supposedly discredited, it's like proving everything he said. So, let's go ahead and go to the clip of Chris Matthews trying to whitewash the jihad attacks.
[46:14.000 --> 46:41.000]  Little precise.
[46:41.000 --> 46:49.000]  Claim responsibility for one such attack over the summer in Nice, France, where a truck barreled through crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people.
[46:49.000 --> 46:56.000]  Trump responded to what happened today in a statement, our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones and the victims of today's horrifying terror attack in Berlin,
[46:56.000 --> 47:07.000]  innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday, ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.
[47:07.000 --> 47:14.000]  Just to reiterate, the deadly incident has not been declared a terrorist attack by the German authorities themselves as of yet.
[47:14.000 --> 47:27.000]  Also today, in the latest example, a serious violent war spilling past that country's borders, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by a lone government while delivering a speech at a museum in the Turkish capital of Ankara.
[47:27.000 --> 47:44.000]  Police sources tell NBC News the gunman was Turkish, a 22 year old officer in the Ankara Special Forces. According to witnesses, the gunman yelled out, don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria, wounding three additional people before being fatally shot by police.
[47:44.000 --> 48:00.000]  Okay, so there he is trying to cast doubt when now there's basically no doubt. Now let's continue with a New Year's resolution from MTV in a moment, but first I want to play London Islamist in front of police chant Caliphate on its way.
[48:00.000 --> 48:16.000]  So they're telling you we're coming with our religious system to take over. They're saying they want Sharia law to be implemented. In France, they're telling Muslim women do not go to French cafes, do not go out without your burkas or will physically come after you.
[48:16.000 --> 48:29.000]  But it doesn't exist. The Muslims want to come here and follow our laws and coexist. Well, some of them do and they're great people. They're called heretics, according to Islam.
[48:29.000 --> 48:38.000]  So Muslim chant USA, you will pay. Caliphate is on its way. We also have video of this going on in England as well.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the one in the US. Here it is.
[48:41.000 --> 49:01.000]  In silence, with all their hands, they complain, but they have nothing to bring with this situation. Victory, victory on its way. Yeah, Allah to you we pray.
[49:01.000 --> 49:21.000]  USA, you pay. Caliphate is on its way. USA, soon you'll pay. Caliphate is on its way.
[49:21.000 --> 49:31.000]  Okay, that is in the UK. We have the other one here in the US this week as well. We can put some of those articles up on screen, but I'm not going to play them just because I can't stand to look at it.
[49:31.000 --> 49:41.000]  And a bunch of arrogant, nerdy wells, most of them on welfare, it's well known they milk it, running around bitching. And most of these aren't even real immigrants. They're like former prisoners, criminals.
[49:41.000 --> 49:50.000]  The colleges and the public schools and the prisons are where this is all being done. They're recruiting. And the left just loves it.
[49:50.000 --> 50:02.000]  Now, let me go ahead and go to this next piece that I mentioned. This is up on infowars.com. They have pulled this down. They do not want you to be aware of this.
[50:02.000 --> 50:14.000]  They've got scores of other videos from the same show on MTV where they have white men crying. I just showed it on screen earlier saying we're sorry, we're racist, all the bad in the world is because of us.
[50:14.000 --> 50:26.000]  And then all these weird white people with these other weird bullying racist minorities saying, listen, you're fundamentally bad. Do you understand?
[50:26.000 --> 50:35.000]  And the universities teach the end of whiteness, how great it's going to be. We must all look alike. We must all interbreed into Mongols.
[50:35.000 --> 50:48.000]  And I'm not against hybrid vigor and people that are mixed. It's just different. The point is making us all mix into a Mongol. When I say Mongol, I mean a Mongol with no culture, a corporate Mongol.
[50:48.000 --> 50:59.000]  It's just programmable. That's a consumer that doesn't even know what they're doing. Again, I'm all for free market, all for wealth, all for power for people individually directed how they see fit in a free market.
[50:59.000 --> 51:14.000]  I'm totally against empty consumerism with what the globalists say we must have. Two different things. They always claim that I'm contradicting myself because they don't understand nuances or the incredible spectrum of free will.
[51:14.000 --> 51:38.000]  Now, let's go to this truly disgusting. I kept wondering, when will MTV go too far? Well, when they got 99% down votes, that's what they got. And when everybody even the left freaked out on this, it finally was so much the Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness, normalcy bias, white people that hate themselves, their religion is hating themselves to finally hear being white inherently is bad period.
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.000]  They finally went, oh my God, this is racism.
[51:44.000 --> 51:50.000]  Hello, white guys. It's about to be a new year. And there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017.
[51:50.000 --> 52:08.000]  I love that they use soft beta white males and then they cut to a black guy with a cat on his shirt. It's all non threatening. I'm wearing pink socks. I've got a cat on, but I'm saying hardcore racist stuff that the KKK would say about black people against white people.
[52:08.000 --> 52:23.000]  It's their uniform. It's all trendy, soft, fun, vicious. We're not gonna let you keep it in your money. We're gonna run your life or tell you what words to use. It's a cult using race based garbage as its operating system. Here it is.
[52:23.000 --> 52:32.000]  Hey, fellow white guys. It's about to be a new year. And there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017. Resolutions for white guys.
[52:32.000 --> 52:45.000]  Try to recognize that America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white guy. Can we all just agree that black lives matter? Isn't the opposite of all lives matter? Black lives just matter. There's no need to overcomplicate it.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  Also, new lives matter.
[52:47.000 --> 53:05.000]  Do you notice the arrogance of your watching and the hatred of these people's eyes? Their whole cult is that they feel inferior, whether they're a wimpy white guy or whatever, and then they're going around to bully and boss you around in a gang of limp-wristed twits that couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag.
[53:05.000 --> 53:24.000]  And they have no idea about the history here in the United States. They have no idea about what happened to the North, the South, what the pirate ships were consisted of, where libertarianism began. They have no idea that the West was this new Atlantis experiment of true liberalism to try to set up a new system to then phase all of that out.
[53:24.000 --> 53:42.000]  Russian historians know that. They claim they're a land-based empire against the whole Atlantean experience. But you don't even know that true liberalism came out of the West. You're sitting here saying that Christian liberalism is the worst thing in the world, but let me tell you, any black folks I know that ever actually go to Africa, they come back going,
[53:42.000 --> 54:04.000]  well, I love America now. Absolutely you do. Or you go to other places. I'm telling you, this is crazy. But again, minorities are the majority now in most areas. The globalists want to blow up that upwardly mobile, classically liberal stairway to wealth and security and culture.
[54:04.000 --> 54:19.000]  That's what they're doing because they're bringing in poverty. They're giving you college degrees that are worthless. They don't want you to have this birthright. Fake liberalism is the globalist counterfeit to kill the real Thomas Jeffersonian liberalism they want to destroy.
[54:19.000 --> 54:38.000]  Then Russia decries the anti-family, anti-human liberalism they see and believe that that's the original liberalism that was here in the United States and Europe when it's not. So Alexander, Duggan and others who are smart people need to actually reassess their analysis if they want to look at that.
[54:38.000 --> 54:52.000]  I think it's good that Russia is being pro-family, anti-destruction of the family, cutting taxes for the family, pro-freedom, pro-sovereignty. That's all great, pro-male role model because that only empowers the women.
[54:52.000 --> 55:12.000]  So you don't fall to Islam where it's the mutated extreme of that. But to insult and attack the entire Western experiment, look at the technology, look at the society, look at the culture. You don't need to go in some troglodyte direction just because the modern false left has hijacked technology and used it to enslave.
[55:12.000 --> 55:22.000]  Now that's a message to Russia, that's not really a message to the general public, but I'm sure some of the public will get it, maybe some of the fake liberals will break out of the control paradigm they're in and vomit out the poison and realize you've been brainwashed.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  There's still time. Let's go back.
[55:24.000 --> 55:33.000]  Also, blue lives matter isn't a thing. Cops weren't born with blue skin, right? I mean, yeah, they weren't born blue.
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  Stop bragging about being woke. Stop saying woke.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  Learn what mansplaining is and then stop doing it.
[55:39.000 --> 55:50.000]  I love how the media always says men who are white are the only ones that sit with their legs apart. See, giving us new things we've done that are bad. Women sit with their legs apart.
[55:50.000 --> 55:58.000]  That's how you sit back and relax. Obama does it all the time, but it's okay when he does. Google Obama Man Spreading.
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.000]  If you do it, it's wrong to sit back on a couch and relax or there's room on a subway to sit back and lean back.
[56:04.000 --> 56:11.000]  You've got to be uptight because you're a man. But even worse, you're a white man.
[56:11.000 --> 56:19.000]  Oh, mansplaining, not man spreading. Oh, exactly. Men aren't supposed to talk and be leaders and know things. Oh, yeah, that's even worse.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  Only the state is your God. Right, women? Here it is.
[56:23.000 --> 56:31.000]  Don't prioritize the well-being of an Ivy League athlete over the woman he assaulted. We all love Beyonce. And yes, she's black.
[56:31.000 --> 56:39.000]  Back it up to the start. Notice you've got all these black football players, all these black sports players beating up women, doing all this stuff.
[56:39.000 --> 56:51.000]  But we've got to go find one white swimmer that reportedly date-raped somebody and make it the end of the world because white males are rapist even though they're the lowest demographic group other than some Asian males to rape.
[56:51.000 --> 57:05.000]  Doesn't matter. Say they are. And then say some white guys rape a black girl at a lacrosse deal when she was a stripper. Turn out it wasn't true. But again, this is the media projecting all bull, all weaponized racist garbage.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  Here it is.
[57:06.000 --> 57:12.000]  Hey, fellow white guys, it's about to be a new year. And there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  You know, start over again. I'm sorry. We're going to go out to break with it. I'm not going to interrupt this time.
[57:15.000 --> 57:24.000]  The first white guy is like real wimpy. Oh, hi. And that's, you're a good white guy. You have a chicken neck and you do what you're told and you don't exist and you don't affect change.
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.000]  You're not part of history. You roll over and culturally die. Then you're going to be accepted. Okay. Let's play it.
[57:30.000 --> 57:39.000]  Hey, fellow white guys, it's about to be a new year. And there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017.
[57:39.000 --> 57:45.000]  First off, try to recognize that America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white guy.
[57:45.000 --> 57:53.000]  Can we all just agree that black lives matter isn't the opposite of all lives matter? Black lives just matter. There's no need to overcomplicate it.
[57:53.000 --> 57:59.000]  You overcomplicated it. You were the ones that always kept saying only black lives matter.
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.000]  And like taking over events saying only black lives matter and going after folks that said all lives matter.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  Learn what mansplaining is and then stop doing it.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  Oh, and if you're a judge, don't prioritize the well-being of an Ivy League athlete over the woman he assaulted.
[58:12.000 --> 58:18.000]  We all love Beyonce. And yes, she's black, so of course she cares about black issues.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  I'm talking to you, quads news.
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  Feel free to take Kanye West though. You guys can have it.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  You know what you did, Kanye.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  Nobody who has black friends says that they have black friends.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  And just because you have black friends doesn't mean you're not racist. You're gonna be racist with black friends.
[58:33.000 --> 58:38.000]  Look guys, we know nobody's perfect. But honestly, we do a little better in 2017.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  Some of you guys do a great job. Some of you don't.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.000]  Bullies.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Please. Because 2016 is bad.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  Please, kiss our ass more.
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  You can't be worse than this.
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  Please grovel down. We're bullies.
[58:48.000 --> 58:55.000]  In case you haven't heard, Info Wars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[59:45.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  So if you just joined us, I just spent the last 10 minutes or so of the last hour covering a Kit Daniels article.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  Up on infowars.com that needs to go viral because MTV is scared of this.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  This went too far.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  They've got all these other videos they've done with white men crying and saying, I'm sorry, I'm evil.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Our race is bad.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  We're bad people.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  I mean, this is like Hitler, but from the MTV perspective against white people.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  I mean, it is not the ideology against non-whites, but turned around the other way.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  It is crazy.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  MTV pulls racist resolutions for white guys' video amid outrage.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  And again, Kit's going to post some of the older videos.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  They've done on the same show that we've covered where, again, whites apologize for being whites.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  This is being taught in high schools, colleges, everywhere.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  They are stunting your children.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  They're turning them into mentally ill, crazy people that hate themselves and turning the minorities into brown KKK members if they can.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  While the school tries to teach your five-year-old, they're a trainee and should cut their penis off.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  So, I mean, this is what's going on in this country, folks.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  It's unbelievable.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  So we're going to, again, add those other articles to the story that's up on infowars.com that needs to go viral.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Now, as if that isn't bad enough, we have Michelle Obama running around.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  And by the way, she looks like a snapping turtle.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  I don't say she looks like a snapping turtle because she's black.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  And I just like black people.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  I know a lot of really good-looking black ladies.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  It's because she looks like a hateful snapping turtle who's a man.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  She looks like a trainee.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  And of course, I say that's the media attacks me because everybody hates the media and they just come to us with media taxes.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  And the media hadn't figured out how much they're hated, so they keep taking the bait.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  But, sorry, video.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Michelle Obama compares Americans to toddlers.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  Now, I compare myself to an albino gorilla, so it's okay to insult people.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  And then if you can prayer around and say it about yourself.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  But getting serious, that's what my kids call me.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  They go, you look like a gorilla, daddy.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  You're hairy like one, daddy.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  I could do kind of have a chest like a gorilla.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  The fact that guys this morning, we were out exercising and they were calling me a gorilla.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  So, anyways, continuing.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  That was Q and Pat and my son was out with us this morning exercising and hiking.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  It was all a big, big funny about how I look like a gorilla.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  Better than a snapping turtle.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Now continuing.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  U.S. confidence surges to highest level that Gallup has ever recorded on Trumpphobia.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  But that's okay.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  He's a bad person.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Michelle Obama and Michael Moore, they know everything.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Meanwhile, she compares people that voted, the American people for Trump, as toddlers that hit their head.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  She's the mommy, we're the idiots.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Here she is with Oprah Winfrey.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  Let's analyze this propaganda.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Your husband's administration, everything, the election was all about hope.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  Do you think that this administration achieved that?
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  Yes.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  I do.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Because we feel the difference now.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Racial division.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  Now we're feeling what not having hope feels like.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Exuberance.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Hoping is necessary.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  It's a necessary concept.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Barack didn't just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  He and I and so many believe that if you, what else do you have if you don't have hope?
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  What do you give your kids if you can't give them hope?
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  Our children respond to crises the way they see us respond.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  It's like the toddler that bumps his head on the table and they look up at you to figure out whether it hurts.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  And if you're like, oh my God, they're crying.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  But if you're like, you know what, babe, it's okay.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  It's okay.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  And I feel that way about the nation.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  I feel that Barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  That's enough.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  So Barack Obama is our daddy and we've hit our head.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  She's talking about her constituents.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  She's not talking about the people that she thinks are idiots about it for Trump.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  She's saying her constituents are like toddlers that have hit their head.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  That's about what they're like, actually.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  And they look up to her and she goes, that's okay, baby.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  It's going to be all right.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  I mean the arrogance, the elitism.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  These are the folks that go to Africa and tell people they can't have cars or air conditioning as he walks off Air Force One
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  with 10 planes behind him and thousands of people.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  And carbon footprints bigger than anything you can imagine and 50 million a day being spent.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  But you can't have a house or a car or an air conditioner.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  Yesterday, Krugman posted a short article on his Twitter account, warning America about what he calls Trumponomics.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  Most of us living outside the matrix know better than to take Krugman seriously because he's been wrong so many times in the past.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  I'm very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality Info Wars biome defense probiotic.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  We've been testing this formula for years but this is the limited first run to the public so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the Info War.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com this is a sure win.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  10% off on auto ship. Win, win, win at infowarslife.com. Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  The answer.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  So Michelle Obama comes out with Oprah Winfrey and insults her supporters.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  We played the full clip and context earlier. I'm going to play it again in a moment, just the short part where she says, you know,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  let's see the nation is toddlers that hit their head on a table and they look up at mommy and you've got to tell them everything's all right.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  We're going to bleed you dry. She didn't actually say what she was thinking.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  But she says, we're going to take care of you. That's how she sees her constituents as a bunch of toddlers.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  And I got to say, we've gone out and seen their constituents. They do look like a bunch of toddlers who've been through shock therapy and then a lobotomy with an ice pit.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  And then the rest of them are a bunch of parasites feeding on the lobotomized toddlers.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  So it's a very, very sad situation.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  Indeed, we have Chris Hayes. We covered last hour. It's up on infowars.com.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  Trying to cover up right now the fact that it's Islamic terror that killed the ambassador in Turkey and ran over the people at the Christmas festival there in Berlin.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  Whatever happened to Berlin?
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  Well, I guess it's been brainwashed. That's that's what's going on there in there in there in Berlin.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  And of course, you should add in the state of Berlin has its own state. Their Secretary of State, it calls for Sharia law just last week.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  She's a woman. She doesn't wear a burqa in public, but she wants you to have to wear one.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  And Muslim men have announced in France that if they see women out without burqas or in French cafes, they're going to have Sharia law caning carried out against them.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  And the Stockholm syndrome women, most of them, they love it. They just want to make sure your daughter, your mother has to put on a burqa as well.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  So that's all coming up. We also have several guests joining us today.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  Last hour, I played the video that they have removed. They don't want you to see it. MTV pulls racist resolution for white guys video amid outrage.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Quite frankly, this isn't even as bad as some of the videos that we had articles on last year.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  If we should pull some of those videos again, download them and play them where they have white men going, I'm sorry, I call the Lord, whites are evil.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  They're like, that's right. Whites are inherently bad. Learn to say it. Learn to say it.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  The only good whites, though, are the ones that say whites are inherently bad and then they can yell, you're an effing white male at another white male.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  Your opinion doesn't matter.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So this is what they're pushing. We're going to be looking at that in great detail.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  We've got a lot of really exciting economic news I want to get to first.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  And Paul Krugman has really gone to the next level.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  But first, before I do that, let's play the clip.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  Again, that's up on infowars.com. Michelle Obama compares Americans to toddlers.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  Her constituents, particularly, they've hit their head. They're looking up at mommy and she'll make it all okay.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Our children respond to crises the way they see us respond.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  You know, it's like the toddler that bumps his head on the table and they look up at you to figure out whether it hurts.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  And if you're like, oh my God, they're crying. But if you're like, you know what, babe, it's okay. It's okay.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  And I feel that way about the nation. I feel that Barak has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  Having a grown up in the White House who can say to you in times of crisis and turmoil, hey, it's going to be okay.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Let's remember the good things that we have. Let's look at the future. Let's look at all the things that we're building.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  All of this is important for our kids to stay focused and to keep the cult focused.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  Like their work isn't in vain.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  To not look at how your unemployment's done if you're black.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  What will we do if we don't have hope, Oprah?
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  Just to not see our families have been broken up.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  To not see how you've been put in prison in jail by the Democrats pledging to quote the predators in jail,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  take them to heal, domesticate you, which they did in the 60s.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Just stay on the plantation. She'll take good care of you toddlers.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Well, I don't want to be a toddler. What about you? I want to be a man.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  Women want to be women. We want to be free.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Now, before I get to Paul Krugman, blowing both of his proverbial political feed off again with incredible statements
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  and what's really happening in the economy to his chagrin.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Before I do that, I want to air a piece that will certainly trigger folks.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  First for TV viewers, let's put it on screen in front of me and then behind me.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Paul Watson tweeted today, the ultimate triggering.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  Merry Christmas. Doesn't Christmas feel a little more special this year?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Making Christmas great again.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  And for radio listeners, it's got the baby Jesus.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  It's got the American flag, President of the United States.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  It's got Trump all happy presiding over it all with Sandy Claus back there as well.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  And little presents under the tree and it's so falling.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  It's so nice. Winter festival. Don't say Christmas.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  Don't even say holiday now. Let the triggering begin.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Well, it was getting rich a few weeks ago.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  Like in Trump to the grizzly bear in the Revenant, tearing Leonardo DiCaprio apart.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  But I can't stand Leonardo DiCaprio and his politics.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  I like him as an actor. Great, great movie. Very historical.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  I just stopped gushing. The Mexican director, I think is the best.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  I forget his name, best director out there. They call that racism.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  I just say he's a Mexican director like the Russian director.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  But I said to the word Mexican, I'm racist, I'm racist.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  I think he's the best director out there, racist, racist, racist.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  We're admiring someone. See the mind control just totally putting us into a catatonic basket case.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Learned helplessness, mind control system where we don't communicate with each other
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  because we want to be correct and nothing's correct.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Everything's bad. Only, only, only CNN can tell us about WikiLeaks.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  So I'm going to retweet during the break at Real Alex Jones. Doesn't Christmas feel more special this year?
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  We're going to retweet that out to everyone.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And I want to encourage my graphics folks to also put out some politically incorrect stuff as well.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Maybe even the little baby Jesus on it. I love little baby Jesus to quote Talladega Knights.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  But before we do that, let's go ahead and play the Revenant piece here
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  where someone took the point of what Genners was talking about and put it to the big screen.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  Donald Trump is the grizzly bear in the Revenant.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  First of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on the stage.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  Jeff Bush is a low energy person.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  Carson is lower energy than Butch. I don't get it.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  If you're a child, molester, there's no cure.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  I never attacked him on his look and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  I could have said mid. Drop to your knees.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, okay?
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  I've never seen a human being eaten in such a disgusting fashion.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  They're losers. They're babies. It's Rubio.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Little Marco. Little Marco.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  Little Marco and he's not cool. He sweats too much.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  And then, of course, we have Crooked Hillary. Crooked Hillary, Bob.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  She's been crooked from the beginning.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  As I say, Crooked Hillary. Crooked Hillary.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  She's as crooked as they come.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  I've never seen Crooked Hillary clear.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  Such a nasty one.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Do we like the media?
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  Do we hate the media?
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  They are terrible.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  They are the worst sleazy guy right over here from ABC.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Blood coming out of her wherever.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  Whoever even heard of her before the last debate.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  Katie Turner. Little Katie.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  The world's most dishonest people are back there.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  Sit down. Go back to your vision.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  The CNN is terrible.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  Lion Ted. Lion Ted.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  You know, Lion Ted talking about New York values was scorned his face.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  We have Lion Ted Cruz.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  Lion.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  We are lion.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  Bible high. Bible high.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  Put it down and then he lies.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  She said he's a pussy. That's terrible.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  It's L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  You know, I call him Lion Ted.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  I've heard that.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  Put goofy friend named Elizabeth Warren.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  She is a goofus.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  She's a basket kid.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  Goofy Elizabeth Warren.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  Pocahontas.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  Pocahontas?
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Very offensive.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Pocahontas.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  Lisa Anders is speaking.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  And these two young women came up and they took over the microphone.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Microphone? They just took the whole place over.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  And he walked away.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  He looked so weak and so pathetic.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  But Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  You know, she gained a massive amount of weight.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  Pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  Your Twitter account is several.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  And your mother is voting for Trump?
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  By the way, I mean, they call us racist and terrorist and homophobes and just every other name in the book.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  And then when we respond back, we're bad.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  We're mean.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  By the way, they've been reminding me, I didn't plug once in the last hour and I even skipped a break.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  That's why I want to thank all the listeners for supporting us when I do talk about the specials and the products that we have.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  By the way, we've done such a good job this year of not over-ordering product that we're not going to have basically anything left when the new year hits for a few weeks.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  Most of our nutraceuticals are going to be sold out, which is a good thing and a bad thing.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  But that's how we fund our operations.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  But I've been trying to budget things and be a little bit tighter here so I can save money to hire more crew and also pay our people better because they really deserve it.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  I want to thank you all for your support, but you're getting great supplements, great products, great non-GMO seeds, great water filtration systems,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  great apparel to spread the word and fight the globalists in the Info War.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  But our 2016 Christmas Super Sale specials are quickly selling out.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  So you can't get stuff delivered before Christmas in most areas of the United States now.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  You need to stock up on colloidal silver, still 50% off silver bullet, still 33% off on brain force.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  Now 20% more in each bottle on top of that.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  Sign up for auto-ship an additional 10% off.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  There's so many specials I can't go over them all.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Winter sun, 25% off.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  DNA force, 25% off.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  Well, that's sold out.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  Survival shield, X2, 30% off.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  That's about to sell out.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  Biotrusillinium about to sell out.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  I'm going to be in here in the next few weeks pitching T-shirts and water filters and stuff, which you really need, obviously, but not the nutraceuticals because they're going to be sold out.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  So please help us at the year-end sale.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  Blow all this out.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  So we'll have to pay tax on it.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  Plus, you can stock up on high-quality products you're going to be using.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  Again, selenium, tea to electrochemical activity in the body.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  Go read the study for yourself.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  It is incredible.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  Same thing for the true nasin iodine that we have.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  Quite frankly, nobody else has it.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  Superblue is $9.95.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  We're about to sell out of that.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  It has colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  You can pay $14.95.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  We can fund the operation.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  It's a new thing I'm doing.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  You can pay full retail or discount depending on what you want to do.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  And folks are taking advantage of that. A lot of folks are paying for it, full retail.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Help us fund the operation.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  So thank you for the support.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  God bless you for, again, your support, your prayers this Christmas.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  Free shipping store-wide up to 50% off until everything sells out.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  Stay with us.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  We'll be back.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  We'll be back.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  We'll be back.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  We'll be back.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  We'll be back.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  We'll be back.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans, here to wish you all a merry Christmas.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  For over 20 years, we have built a loyal customer base with 100% American-made jeans featuring enhanced fit, comfort, durability, and style.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  Today, all of our inventory is discounted by 20%, so don't delay.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  Enjoy a wonderful shopping experience at gusset.com.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  Thanks for keeping our American dream alive, the original Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  American-made food stores all love to eat.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  Thank you.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  That's the word out of ambassadors and others.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  Hillary obviously has talked about the fact that we needed the policy a year ago, which is now the policy of NATO and the U.S.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  And if they claim there's an attack via cyber attack from the continent of Eurasia, basically, or anywhere in Russian territory,
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  that they are then going to launch a military attack on Russia.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  You cannot make this level of crap up.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  In fact, in the next segment, you guys also just pulled the articles about new U.S. policy to cyber attack, includes military attack on Russia.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  I want to show that to people, because I believe me, it doesn't sound real. I get it. It sounds like a lie.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  Just like, oh, I've got like 15 or more different MTV videos that actually say whites are inherently bad, the world will be good when they're all gone.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  We're just people that have less skin pigment from Northern Europe.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  And technically, I'm a Mongol because I'm part Native American.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  But the whole point is, so what?
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  This is all craziness, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  This is craziness.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  And but they're the ones pushing it because they co-opted the whole libertarian Republican movement to end segregation and all of it in the 60s.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  The party of the KKK did.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  But let's get to this big news right now.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  Paul Krugman, who is wrong almost all the time because he's disinfo operative.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  I've decided if he is like a total idiot with like a 75 IQ or if it's like some type of like secret comedy he's involved in, because the U.S. economy.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  Conference, you know, announcement, the U.S. economy when it comes to confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded Gallup's U.S.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  confidence index has never been higher than it is today ever.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  They're calling it Trump euphoria.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  Now, how does Krugman respond to this?
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  Krugman comes out in the New York Times and says to join Trump administration, you have to be a white nationalist and a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  So question known liars and be white, which isn't even true.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  He goes on to attack the economics that Trump is talking about trying to have infrastructure spending increased with tax incentives to state counties and cities and individuals for infrastructure and for federal funding of infrastructure when infrastructure is falling apart.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Despite the fact Krugman has called for this before because that's just basic Kenzie and economics.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  So he's now going back on what he claims he's an economic follower of, but forget that.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  Guess what he said in the New York Times in 1998, you cannot make this up.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  This is when dinosaur media was telling itself, don't worry in an article about the Internet, we're still going to be dominant.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  Remember back in the late nineties, the media was discussing would they be made obsolete, which has now happened.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  This is at Paul Krugman.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  The growth of the Internet will slow drastically as the flaw in the law, McCaffey's law, which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  Because a parent, most people have nothing to say to each other. By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  Now he made that sound real scientific and real smart like an economist would.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  He's giving you a false system, but as the Internet gotten bigger or smaller, it's gotten tens of thousands of times logarithmically exponentially bigger.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  And by the early 1990s, all the big tech giants had already envisioned the current system we're under.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  But Krugman writes a piece of trash a couple of times a week, sits around getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and thinks he's a rocket scientist.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Now this is almost as bad as people saying that Al Gore invented the Internet because in the 1990s, he presided over some federal infrastructure agreements.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  The Internet was invented by the United States and England and DARPA in the 1960s.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  My father in plan two in high school in the mid-1960s was introduced to the Internet to CD-ROM to all of it that supposedly didn't exist for decades.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  So let me just tell you, we're not in Kansas anymore. They've got some incredibly advanced stuff, but people like Krugman are so delusional, they're not even, I guess, aware of it.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  In fact, when we come back, it's in my stack. I didn't get into this yesterday. I want to talk about how they're invading our homes with AI robot systems, hiding in plain view.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  I'm going to dig that out and cover that as well.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  But first, when we come back, I'm going to get into some of the other big news that I was mentioning and covering here at the beginning of the segment.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  We're also going to open the phones up and take your calls ahead of guests in the third hour.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  In fact, he was found with gunshot wounds to the head 56 years old in his own home.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  The shooting was disclosed by Wren TV, the news breaking shortly after the report coming of the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Ankara, Andre Karlov.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  Now, the circumstances of the shooting remain very unclear, but what we do know is that police are examining all possible motives to his death.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  Many bullet wounds were found in the apartment, in Belosky Prospect, and a gun was discovered under the sink and the bathroom as reported by Wren TV.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  Your latest update on the second assassination of a Russian diplomat in a spade of 48 hours. I'm Margaret Hell reporting for infowars.com.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  infowarslife.com. In the product we make, we fight the global, we fight the new world order.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  We have the new product at infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium. And just recently, we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  I'm taking it now every day. This is so key. BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price. Exclusively available at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  How many times must I tell you, baby? How many bridges I've got to cross? How many times must I explain myself?
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  Oh, we get to talk to the boss now at infowars.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  Well, I'd say we are routing the new world order right now together. How many times?
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  How many times must I say hello?
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  Before you finally understand.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  The globalists are trying to put a chip on everybody's shoulder. White, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  To just be obsessed over what color we are or where we came from, so that we're incompatible.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  Then that forces me to try to stop people from coming in. We're being turned into armies of disgruntled dumbasses.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  But I don't hate these people individually for being sucked into this.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  But the controllers, like we see in the MTV video they've pulled.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  I'll do a special report for the Nightly News tonight showing other clips. They pulled this because of the backlash.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  They're stuff far worse where they're like, it is inherently bad to be white and white men crying, I'm evil, I'm sorry.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  Yes, we need to eradicate white people.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  This is the type of garbage being pushed by MTV that is totally weaponized.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Now you and I see this and wake up to it and know it's wrong.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  What the problem is on the college campuses at the high schools, at the elementary schools, they show little kids from the US to Australia to England.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  Images of little bunny rabbits being killed. This has been in the news.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  Animals dying, seals dying and say you're killing them.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  And some middle school girls go and commit suicide after they see this. It's been in the news all over the world.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  Or they cry seeing an apartment complex. I was talking to one mother and her daughter at Republic School was in the third grade.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  One of the girls came to one of the birthday parties for my daughter a few years ago.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  And her daughter started sobbing going, they're murdering the bodies that live in the field.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  They'd showed them watershed down to the third graders.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  And this is how they're just inflicting them with mental illness, not with empathy, not with real stewardship of the earth.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  Now I want to give you some really serious news.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  Right now, you can again Google, Hillary calls for US military strikes on Russia in response to hacks.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  Or you can type in Biden. Now he gave a speech.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  A massive cyber attack to trigger NATO response. Stotenberg. That was Reuters. He said including military.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  Because every time I mention this people, it's like, print that for me, please. They say, oh, that couldn't be.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  I'm going to show you where they said it. Because I agree. It's sensational. It sounds crazy. It doesn't sound true. It is.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  So the word is, Obama called up Putin and said, we're going to militarily attack you or start killing your people if you do this.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  You notice they've started assassinating the head of Russian intelligence got killed. The ambassador got killed.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  The other guy got killed the same day at his house in Moscow. That shot to death.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  It's going on.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  But before I go there, I wanted just because I've had this in the list since Monday to play it. I've never played it.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  There's so many of these, but I don't want to just say universities are saying don't just say Christmas, don't say holiday.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  I've got the clips all over the country. This isn't some isolated event.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  All the good trendies, you know, adopt the new brainwashing that all over the United States, they're saying ban Christmas, ban the celebration of it.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  Do it now.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  So I thought we should realize this is going on with the children they've got targeted and with the college students.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  Again, they're saying don't hand out Christmas cards and things like that. That's your free speech in your own spare time to do whatever you want.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  You can hand out an invitation to come to a party. You can hand out little postcards that had your artwork on them.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  You could hand out postcards saying please come to my church this Sunday and, you know, accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  Merry Christmas versus Happy Holidays, round 2016.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Here's the clip.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  This is a different inclusive holiday season and so we are just kind of letting the administration know that a lot of students on campus choose not to celebrate anything in the winter season.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  It's like a very Christian normative campus and so we feel like it's just not really a safe space for people of different faith traditions.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  Like this time of year, it feels like people can like shove their like holiday like happiness in your face like, Merry Christmas.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  It's just, you know, it gets kind of old.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  You can give a letter to the administration to be like, hey, like this can be like almost oppressive for some people.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Would you guys like to sign?
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  I will totally sign.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Yeah, like the Christmas lights and there's been rumors like a Christmas tree is going to be going up and like things like that.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  Now that is campus reform for the non like Christmas celebrating students.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Showing the students agreeing, but we have the articles you've seen them where they're actually banning saying only use holiday.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  Then they say don't use holiday.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  And bold into paintings of the football team, you know, don't show masculine men.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  That's hurtful.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  Not all men are masculine.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  Personally, that like aren't religious.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  It's like bullying by wimps.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  Like all the lights, it can be a little bit triggering.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  So we're just trying to make campus a safe space.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  A little bit triggering need to ban those immediately.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Good luck.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  I feel like people have been socialized to like, it's almost oppressive that they don't even know like what Christmas really means, which it's like a Christian holiday.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  Like Christians have a lot of privilege on campus because it's like a lot of the holiday stuff is usually geared towards them.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  The Christmas spirit, everything that comes along with that of people like assuming that we want to accept gifts and assuming that we want to.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  That's good.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  And see what they're doing is they want to overthrow what's already existing in this country and then replace it with what?
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Corporate worship, political correctness worship, white people are inherently bad worship.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  Let's all have chips on our shoulders worship.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  Mental illness.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  What is a mega banking cartel that's robbing you of your freedoms, robbing you of your money, robbing you of your future, robbing you of your culture do?
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  It does this type of psychological warfare stuff to turn people into jibbering nutcases.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  These people going to get college educations and 90 plus percent of the time will never pay off the student loans in many cases or the statistic of 90 percent is and or both these things.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  Something like 50% pay off the loans.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  You can look it up for yourself.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  It varies and you know, something like 50% as well.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  But then they kind of actuary it together.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  It's close to 90%.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  You can pull this up.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  We'll never either pay off the loans or get a job in the field they actually got a degree for.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  Most degrees are worthless.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  If you want, if you want an engineering or you want one, you like an EMT certificate or law enforcement certificate or a nurse certificate, those type of jobs.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  You can probably, you know, live a decent paycheck off that for the degree you paid for.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  But not with teaching degrees, you're probably never with a standard teaching certificate going to even make back the money you have spent on the education.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  And it's not going to compete with a comparable job mowing and lawns.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  You know how many people I know that hustle, knock on doors and do good jobs moving lawns.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  I know people that have two or three trucks working for them that started to out of Hispanics and I know black and I know white business owners that have mixed crews.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  You name it.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  Some have pure Hispanic crews that tends to be Hispanics.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  It's not racist because they're Hispanic, whatever.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  The point is that's the crew as folks they know.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  It's homogeneous.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  Who are making $300,000 a year living in McMansions and driving $50,000 cars around.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  I'm going from memory here, so I'm bumbling around.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  The point is that I know a lot of people that have working class jobs that own plumber companies, lighting companies, you name it.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  They're living like kings.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Their employees are paid good.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  They're doing well and they don't have college degrees.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  That's well known that most of the billionaires in this country didn't go to college or quit college because they're outside of the box.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  You go to college to basically learn how to conform and be put into a managed economy cog and then to socially go along with the cult programming of the corporate cult that's being set up.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  And the corporate cult changes all the time, so there's always new downloads of the new way, the new political correctness, the new terms to use.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  And then you're promoted on how you follow those orders like a little brainwashed corporate Borg minion.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  Let me just pause for a moment because this is really getting me wound up.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  I think I'm on a roll today, but I tend to get too upset, too excited, my brain starts going too fast, and I start getting facts wrong and jumbling words.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Let me just...
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  But imagine I'm up here ranting for hours exposing this to the public, going over it, reminding you how obscene these people are.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  And it's important to have a pit stop and take a break for a moment and just cool off for a second.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  Cool off like fancy.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  Cool off and relax.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  There we go.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  Now we can refocus.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  I haven't even scratched the surface of the news, but I've been a good boy.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  I've probably covered 60 or more big articles and I've only got 200 more.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  Today's a big news day.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  I've got at least 200 more.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  By the way, you think I just say 200 more looking at my articles?
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  I bet you money that if I count these articles, it's 200 or close to it or more.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  I've learned what these stacks are.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  This little stack of it's only an inch deep.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  I got a four inch stack right there.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  I bet it's 20 articles.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  This is so enjoyable, not just focusing on the globalists for a minute, just doing something mindless.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  I said that was 20, it's 23.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  I bet that stack that's almost four inches tall.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  I bet that's 80 articles.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  That's 100.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  We had all these together.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  I bet it's 200.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  Again, I'm not just saying stuff here.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  I live this every day.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  I know what 200 articles are that I've looked at before I went on air.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  Can you imagine the headache I get looking at these sniveling maggots and what they're doing?
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  I'm so sick of these people.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  Then I get to have a reporter here ask me questions like,
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  so you really think they're setting up a world government and I just my eyes glaze over, you want to see 500 news articles announcing it?
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  I've got articles here in the stack.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  Now there's no time in the sour because I've got David night popping in the next big breaking news.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  That's incredibly poignant, incredibly saddening that you must see dealing with Islam.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  Probably some of the sickest video I've ever seen and that's saying a lot from Islam.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  Oh, it's not Islam Al Qaeda, ISIS.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  I understand where the Muslims are crying it.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  A lot of Muslims don't support this.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  They're afraid they're going to get targeted because nobody gets bullied more than Muslims by Muslims.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  That's why it gets so extreme because there's a there's a contest to see who can be the most abusive.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  Who can be the most out of control?
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  Who can be the most bullying?
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  Instead of the West trying to see who can be the most liberated, the most free, the most open.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  And then now that's hijacked by extreme leftist who are so leftist,
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  they're fascist trying to end all of our freedoms in the name of delivering us to a heavenly abode.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  That's called a cult.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  They are a cult.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  I don't say that rhetorically or with rhetoric to make my point.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  They are by scientific design, the scientific dictatorships idea of human sabotage so they can control us.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  It's the rearguard action as they steal the future running into the future with the future under their arm,
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  hoping we sit around in the dirt fighting with each other while they hijack humanity with their giant breakaway society system.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  But before I go any further, I didn't plug last hour, so I'm going to plug a couple times this hour.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  We're running the biggest specials.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  In fact, we did an analysis.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  We're now running the biggest specials.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  We've had some big specials this year, but this is the biggest with free shipping with the auto ship 10% off additionally,
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  with 50% off colloidal silver, 33% off a bunch of the other nutraceuticals.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  The lowest special is 25% off on one of the items.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  Which one of those is that?
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  That's DNA force, but it's sold out.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  And oh, that's the big point.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  Most of this is going to sell out by the new year, which was my plan.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  But we did a little bit too good a job. I wanted to have some inventory going into next year.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  But I didn't want to pay too much, you know, that we have a state tax here in Texas on inventory.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  Oh, Frone's tax and all those other garbage.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  So yeah, we're a low tax state, but still that didn't stand much in one of the, you know, overtaxed countries.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  And so we're going to sell out of the toothpaste.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  It's got ionic, little silver and the super metal vitality for vital shield X to silver bullet.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  It looks like it's about to sell out.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  But the living defense parasite cleanse bio PCA bio tricillinium secret 12.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  Our biome defense probiotic that is the best we can develop with the top companies out there.

[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  I thought that'd be a big hit.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  That's not one of our big hits.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  It's one of the best vitamin mineral fruit punches out there with the amino acids you name it.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  And it's concentrated only has 4.7 stars,
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  which is incredible and is not one of our best sellers.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  I use it every day and love it. I don't know why.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  I thought that'd be our best seller, but it isn't.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  You ought to take advantage of that.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  That's something that isn't close to selling out.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  infowarslife.com or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  And by the way, one of the best ways to get your kids to take a multivitamin,
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  if it's a hard multivitamin, most of those go right through your kids.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  It's been proven in studies.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  I don't want to get into it, but everybody knows most of the hard bills go out.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  So what we have is liquid, so you absorb almost all of it.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Powder is good too. It's in a powdered caplet.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  One of that gets absorbed because it turns into powder in the intestines,
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  in the stomach of the intestines.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  So you do get good absorption, but nothing like under your tongue,
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  like a lot of our products, or drinking it.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  So it mixes with the saliva, digestion begins, it gets absorbed in the mouth,
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  the esophagus, esophageal membrane, and then it goes in the stomach,
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  and then the upper and lower intestines, the large and small intestines,
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  so more of it gets absorbed.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  It's amazing. I love it.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  When I first advertised that a little bit, it's, you know, sampler container in my hand
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  that's half the size of the real container, but even the real container itself is concentrated.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  So it's the same price as leading competitors, but it doesn't matter.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  I'm not in competition with Beyond Tanging Tangerine.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  It's a rare earth mineral, basically, derives super high quality,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  infowarsteam.com, you buy it there, it helps fund the operation.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  Five mineral fusion is plant derived, so two different systems.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  I would put them on par with each other.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  My kids, personally, one of my kids likes our five mineral fusion,
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  the other two like the original Beyond Tanging Tangerine,
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  which is still my favorite. They have the 2.0 that's totally organic,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  and I don't like it as much.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  I mean, I'm not bad about it. I think it tastes like peach.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  Maybe I just like fruit punch, but you get the incredible original Beyond Tanging Tangerine,
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  and, of course, the new one that's excellent, at infowarsteam.com.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  There's a toll free number there. You can call as well and order that way.

[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  Now, we're going to come back after break and plunge into Obama,
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  still trying to start World War III with 29 days out,
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  29 days, ladies and gentlemen, until Trump's in, and what else will they try then?
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  I will open the phone some of the next hour, even though we're going to have guests in here,
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  because I want to get your take on how they may try to sabotage Trump.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  I want to crowdsource your knowledge.

[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  Thank you very much.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  One World Way solved my irregularity.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  I've been plagued with constipation for years,
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  Three weeks on One World Way set me on a new path.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  That was five months ago, and I haven't been irregular since.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  Will it work the same way for you?
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  I don't know. It worked for me.

[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  But now a landmark U.S. government study confirms increased health risks
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  The time to protect yourself is now.

[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  How was a highwayman? Along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  Sword and pistol by my side. Many a young maid lost her bobbles to my trade.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade. The master tongue me in the spring of twenty five.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  But I am still alive.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Through the progeny.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  Alright, David Knight's our guest. Start of the next hour.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  I'm going to get into the World War III Obamas trying to start.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  And we're in more danger now than before.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  Understand that. This is very, very serious.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  And I'm going to show you where NATO says they want physical war with Russia.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  And then we're going to have Leon McAdib in here along with Owen and other great reporters
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  to give their views just on year end, what's happened, what they think is coming.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  I'm going to try to spice some of your calls in. I gave that number out so we went to break.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  So we'll launch that phone system, 800-25-99-231.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  But David Knight, I've encouraged David and reporters,
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  when something's really hardcore I've missed, and you think it's important, I respect our crew.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  If there aren't guests on at that time or if there's something breaking, go ahead and just come in.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  Bring us the news. He's done something really sad.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  He showed me about 20 minutes ago during the last break.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  So I asked him to show you this and talk about it here in this segment and in the next.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  So we're going to be breaking that down right now.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  You know, if you're a TV viewer, I have this beautiful shot of the Christmas tree, time lapse last night.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  We actually have a time lapse. It's amazing.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  And the capital that our great crew shot.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  And I look at that and think Islamists want to run people over and kill families at these.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  And then meanwhile, David Knight has footage and a story about a mother training her little children to be suicide bombers.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  I mean, this is mind control, pure demonic evil.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  And our leftist media is in bed with it and thinks it's sexy and says the Russian ambassador deserved to die.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  So David Knight, tell us about the sickeningness.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Well, you know, Alex, I was shooting an interview for the nightly news and my wife had sent me this story.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  It's now on Drudge. People can find it there.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  But we had a story yesterday from Syrian girl and she was talking about a seven year old that had been used as a suicide bomber for the Syria at the Syria police station.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  And now we've got footage of a mother who is kissing her children goodbye as suicide bombers,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  a seven year old girl and a nine year old girl. And Alex, this is just gut-riching.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  This is nothing but a cult of death.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  And then the sickening evil demonic dad comes in.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  I mean, I want to be honest, I just instinctively want to attack him.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  Well, you look at what's happening.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  And of course, the guy has been identified as someone who's with Al Nusra.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  We were told back in 2013 that Al Nusra was part of the moderate rebels.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  We had two CIA agents meeting with them.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  Such child abuse. Obama and Hillary in the left are backing these people.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Why are they so evil? Why do they hate Christianity? I'm talking about the liberals.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  Yeah. Well, they were meeting openly with them back in 2013,
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  telling us they're moderate rebels.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Then in 2015, we were told that by Petraeus, hey, we need to use Al Nusra against Al Qaeda.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  They are the same thing. They try to pretend they're distinct groups and then they say that they're the same.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  But when you look at this video, you look at this woman who is dressed head to toe in black like some kind of death cult figure.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  And that's what it is. This is like the grim reaper, but that's her own children.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  You know, in our country, mothers are usually cry when they drop their kids off to school in the first grade for the first time, abandoning them.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  She's hugging them to send them off to blow people up in Aleppo.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  And then our media literally backs these rebels and acts like they're rock stars.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  They have Netflix shows, HBO shows. Man, I'm sick of these people.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  We need to take the gloves off. We need to call it what it is. You said it's a cult. It is a cult of death.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  We need to understand. It's a satanic death cult. It's a satanic death cult.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  This, let me tell you, this form of Islam is Satanism.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  They've made a sacrament of death.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  And that's why we see the types of things that we saw at a Christmas market this week.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  And that's why we see this type of thing with a mother using her children.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  They sent them in to this police station, blew them up, remote-controlled them.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  They believe...
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  That's right. I want to come back and talk more about this.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  And I want to take this very live clip right now, excise it out and post it to YouTube to just show the world the type of people we're dealing with.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  A mother and father prepared to murder their children for Islam.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  And the left won't say a damn word because they hate this country so much.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  They're cuckled. We'll be back on our shows.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  We need each day with our modern diets.

[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  Think of the beauty of Merle Haggard's voice.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  And then think about the ugliness of Orthodox Islam and what it's mutated into.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  Say some prayers for those little girls.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  Total evil.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  We've got to do what we've got to do, don't we?
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  Gloves got to come off with the sickening satanic left and the spirit cookers and the pedophiles and the portionists that are involved in all this evil.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  The selling of the Chinese baby's parts.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  The fall-on gong being executed because they're Buddhist.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  They exercise their religion in peace.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  Not a word from the State Department.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  Not a word from the globalist.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  Other than celebrating it and saying China runs our lives, Islam runs our lives, Sharia law is the way to go.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  There's a sickening report out of the Southern Primary Law Center that's been totally discredited.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  Obviously law enforcement doesn't even use them anymore.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  Where they say Trump's National Security Advisor Twitter account shows the extent of anti-Muslim beliefs.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  They talk about General Flynn, the former head of military intelligence, Pentagon intelligence.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  Very senior rank in intelligence.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  He's about as high as it gets, exposing that our government was backing Al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria and saying we shouldn't do it.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  So Obama relieved him three years ago.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  Now he's the Chief National Security Advisor to President Trump.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  And they have quotes in here like saying Islam kills children.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  Islam is dominant in areas that exist.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  We can't coexist with Orthodox Islam.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  It's rational to fear Islam.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  They're going to attack us.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  That's like saying the sky's blue.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  And then they attack him for saying it and bringing it up and say remove him.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  And Chris Hayes tries to cover up the Islamic attacks in Europe with these 18-wheelers running over children in Nice and in Berlin.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  And now we have footage released by Al-Nusra themselves of their little five and six-year-old daughters going to suicide bomb
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  and blow themselves up and the mother kissing them and hugging them.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  And what does Flynn say in the article?
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  He goes, where is Islam decrying the bombings?
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  No one decries it in Islam when they do it.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  Is that a fear or do they support this?
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  I want to hear Islam decry blowing up little girls to kill other innocent people.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  And I want to hear the left decry it and stop pushing it like the folks in Aleppo are heroes
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  when the Russians and the Syrians valiantly battle this scum.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  David Knight.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  So you know, we're always hearing from the liberals that we got to do it for the children.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  Let's do it for these children.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  Let's protect women.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  Look at the woman who is covered up here in a black burky.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  You can't even see her face.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  Let's do it for the LGBT people.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  In the shroud of death.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  All the groups, LGBT people as well, all the groups that the Democrats say they're there to protect,
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  these are the people that are being attacked specifically and most directly by these Islamists.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  But of course they want to kill everyone who isn't a part of their cult of death
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  and they even want to kill their own children as part of that cult of death.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  This is the disgusting thing here.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  Look how sad the little one is.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  Look how they look like zombies.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  Yes.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  And then she just leans up against her mother wishing she'd get love.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  And instead she gets to put a belt of plastic on her with nails in it that blow her into pieces
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  because her satanic mother is a frickin' demon.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  That's absolutely insane.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  And Alex, you know what?
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  When we're hearing Obama talking about pushing against the Russians
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  and we're going to look for a provocation so we can go against them,
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  understand what Obama is trying to do to your children or depending on your age,
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  maybe it's your mother and father who are soldiers that are going to be sent to die
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  for this guy who is part of a suicide cult himself.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  And let's not forget, they've got shows all over TV worshiping the rebels,
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  saying they're angels.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  When 98% of them are al-Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nuzra, al-Nuzra is al-Qaeda.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  That flag behind them is the al-Qaeda flag.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  Our media backs all this while we've got at least a thousand U.S. troops,
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  special forces battling, dozens and dozens have died this year in the battle
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  while schizophrenically Obama sits there giving support to the rebels.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  So the Pentagon's been ignoring Obama for three years
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  and has been doing things that Obama dare not challenge.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  That's how the civil war is really going in this country, David.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  You know, Alex, as I mentioned before, going back to 2012,
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  where they were trying to sell the idea that there was this gas attack
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  which we eventually learned was not the Syrian government,
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  they were saying we're going to use these different rebel groups
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  against the other rebel groups.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  They're all connected.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  General Flynn pointed that out.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  But as late as 2015, we had General Petraeus saying,
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  hey, let's use al-Nuzra who is part of al-Qaeda against ISIS.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  And let's understand something.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  These Islamist's pigs, they put this out themselves.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  They're proud of it.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  Most of us living outside the Matrix know better
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  than to take Krugman seriously
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  because he's been wrong so many times in the past.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  It was Paul Krugman himself who predicted back in 1998
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  the drastically slow growth of the internet.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  And I'm going to quote him here.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  By 2005, it will be clear that the internet's impact on the economy
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  has been no greater than the fax machine.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  You can learn more about Paul Krugman's liberal logic

[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  There are so many people calling to my radio show and telling me how young Jebedy and the products at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  This is what they are putting out.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  And man, if you watch the Oscars, or you watch the news, or you watch Netflix, or just all over the white helmets, the good people of Aleppo,
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  and leftist media is like, kill that Russian ambassador in Turkey.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  My God, the good people of Aleppo.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  A bunch of jihadis that invaded Syria took over and are murdering everybody in mass, raping little girls to death, selling them into sex slavery,
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  murdering their own daughters, and it's all cute, it's all funny, it's all trendy.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  In fact, let's take that little clip there.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  I just pointed out and added to the bigger piece that Knight's about to put out where we put all this in context.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  In context.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  Because it is just crazy town.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  And it's time to expose these monsters that are so anti-West, so anti-Christian, so anti-women,
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  that they have this weird fetish to support the most radical, degenerate, viral, mutinous mutations of Islam.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  I want to hear the Muslims decry this.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  Jihad mom kisses tiny daughters age seven and nine.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  They look younger than that to me, goodbye, and sends them off on suicide bomb mission.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  Add this short little clip, too, so I clarify what I'm saying right now.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  I've seen them blow up six-year-olds, you name it.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  They look like that.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  I guess they're so malnourished in the jihadi, heavenly kingdom that it doesn't matter.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  I'm not somebody that talks about violence.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  I'm not somebody that shoots my mouth off.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  But let me tell you something.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  I love to get in a ring with that guy.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  I'd really love to get in a ring with him.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  It's not out of a hateful feeling.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  It's to want to protect those little girls.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  I guarantee I'd get that guy down and I'd beat his brains out.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  I'd just punch him right in the eyes until his cheekbones break and just ram those eyes right into that brain.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  I'd punch him until my fist was a broken, bloody mess.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  I just have to say that.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  It just gives me a little bit of relief to fantasize.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  I'm not a sadistic person.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  That's a natural urge when a baby's being attacked by a monster to take that monster on,
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  whether it's a wildcat or some degenerate vampire like those children's mother and father.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  Excuse me.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  Now, I'm not doing this for an infomercial.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  I'm going to get into the Obama Reportly Calling and Threatening to Attack Russia.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  The story's up on infowars.com.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  It's so important and it ties into NATO's actual statement.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  So Steve Watson has reported it.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  We've got amazing sources.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  Be sure to check it out for yourself.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  That's coming up.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  I'll leave these guys back on the nightly news at some point.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  But the reason I did this, we get sent business ideas every couple of days.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  And we have to pass on most of them because usually something's already patented or it's already out there.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  It's not original or we don't think it's feasible.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  And who knows what I know.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  But when I learned how young Justin, I guess it's God's key.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  You can tell me God's key if I'm pronouncing it wrong.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  Get trumpcards.com and I'll plug where you can get them from them.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  We're selling them too.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  And of course, a lot of companies wouldn't even make a trump card.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  I was telling them earlier, a bicycle wouldn't even make it.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  That's how controlled the economy is.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  So these cost them a lot to make.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  I mean, I'm getting them for like $89 from them and they cost $20.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  But it's got gold foil on them.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  You know, they're really fancy cards.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  And it's got Paul Watson.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  It's got myself in the info or piloting a jet aircraft with the UN and Hillary after me.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  It's got a whole bunch of trumps, obviously.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  And I think he does look pretty good imperial.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  I got to hand it to him.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  Most of the cards are Trump.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  It's got a lot of other people in there as well.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  So you definitely want to find out more about that.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  It's got Stefan Malinu, Richard Spencer, Chuck C. Johnson,
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  Trump, Nigel Farage, Trump's the clubs,
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  Trump of diamonds, Milo Yiannophilus, Katie McHugh,
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  and a bunch of other folks there.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  So it's exciting.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  I like it.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  And again, is this going to save the world?
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  No.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  But young people like this, especially putting something out, becoming entrepreneurs,
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  little bits of culture like this, taking back the culture wars, creating art,
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  putting information out, celebrating our victories.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  Some great B-roll the folks.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  Shout out.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  I hadn't seen this.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  It's just beautiful.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  It's got to be the prettiest card deck I've ever seen other than some hand-painted ones
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  I've seen from the Middle Ages in a museum.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  Very, very stylish.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  They kind of go with the Middle Ages or Renaissance style of art.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  Very, very powerful.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  They're available at infowarstore.com, or you can support these guys 100% and get them
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  again on their website that I mentioned earlier.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  But I am excited to have them join us.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  I mean, I know one of you's names.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  I guess the other's your brother.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  You sure look alike.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  Introduce yourselves.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  Who's who here?
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  The two-headed monsters.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  You look great, but kind of like a two-headed monster there from Jack of the Mean Stalker.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  Was that Jack of the Mean Stalker?
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  Another one there in your apartment.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  Tell us about this and introduce yourselves.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  I'm Justin.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  This is my brother, Nick, over here.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  We worked on the project together.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  We branded as the Kadeski brothers.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  I had the idea and did all the logistics and websites, the work set up, and he did like
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  most of the art and did all the art.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  Yeah.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  So, yeah.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  Well, it's exciting.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  And I mean, I just want to say I saw the mock-ups you did and thought they looked pretty good.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  But man, with the gold foil and the way you laid these out, these look better than almost
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  all the professional card decks I've seen out there, including fancy ones.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  So congratulations.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  Thanks.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Thanks.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  That's why they cost 20 bucks.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  Yeah.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  We're really happy with the way the foil came out, like in the metallic inks.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  Like we have one right here.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  And yeah, like we weren't sure exactly how it was going to look, but like we're really
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  happy with the way they came out.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  Well, it's all original artwork.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  In fact, the back of the cards are great.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  Tell folks about the back of the cards as I show that to TV viewers and describe it to
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  radio listeners.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  Yeah.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  Like the back of the card, I based it largely off of like a traditional bicycle deck that
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  you pick up at a store like the normal kind of deck.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  So all the designs are based on that.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  But it's Trump.
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  It's Trump at the White House.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  It's Trump at the White House.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  I like how you had these ready before he got in the White House, too.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  You're already having them produced before.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  So you were putting your money where your mouth was.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  Yeah, we actually started on this project.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  Like we launched our Twitter account like right before the, what was it?
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  Like SuperTuesday?
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  Iowa Caucus?
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  Yeah.
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  Right before Iowa Caucus.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  And we, like just that weekend, we talked to Milo in person because he went to a college
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  near us.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  And we, that's how the entire project got started because he agreed to be in it.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  And then we got through him, we got the Gavin, we got Lauren Southern and so on.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  Well, keep telling me about your views and how you woke up to the New World Order.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  How did you start?
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  Well, I've been involved in politics probably since I was like in late middle school earlier
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  than a lot of my peers.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  I was always, I grew up with a computer.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  My dad's always been a computer.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  So I've always been like heavily connected.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  And I just stumbled upon politics and I just was drawn to, I guess, more right wing ideas.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  I've been involved for a while now.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  And we started off like, we sort of are like, and caps, like, you know, like an archer capitalist,
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  not like the lefty, you know, sort of anarchist.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  But like we came through, like, stuff from all new, like people like that.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  And, you know, that opened our eyes to a lot of potential ways of setting things up and,
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  you know, really interested us.
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  Well, and now you're here on the info war.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  I wish you a lot of success.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  What other entrepreneurial ideas are you launching?
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  Right now we're actually software developers and software developer.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  He's a designer and we're designing for a startup of ours.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  It's not really related to this, but we do want to get back to more political ideas as soon as we can.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  We think there's a big cultural shift, you know, as Breitbart Andrew Breitbart himself says is politics is downstream from culture.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  And that's something I think that people on the right often forget is that the lefties have a lot of control over art.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  And a lot of control over culture.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  It's completely artificial.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  There's no reason for that divide is completely artificial divide is because this is basically just the politics of it.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  And yeah, and like how like everything is from Hollywood and how there's control there over like what you're allowed to show,
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  what you're like, you know, what messages you're allowed to send.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  But there's no reason for that.
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  I think it would be nice if we saw the revival of like right wing art.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  That's right.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  And what's the best website get Trump dot cards?
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  Yeah, correct.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  All right, get get Trump dot cards.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  Now, I know Trump's famous about defending his image and things like that.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  I even hesitated putting out Trump as my president, but he's a public figure.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  We have a right to do it.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  I know he's aware of what I've done and has that a problem with it.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  I know he's had a problem of people putting out Trump decks that basically demonized him.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  But I think you've got fair use here is it's a deck of activists, including the president.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  He's a public figure.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  You got the permission of the other activists.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  They're completely covered here.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  But who knows?
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  This is historical.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  Everybody should get it.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  You also have an art gallery, which I want to get some of this and hang it up.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  I like the fact that I'm the ace of diamonds.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  Is Gavin McGinnis the ace of spades?
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  Yeah, he's the ace of spades.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  Yeah, he personally recommended for him to be to be the ace of space because he has a tattoo on his arm that you know,
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  he recommended what which is fine.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  But Trump should be the ace of spades in this deck.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  I mean, I don't have a problem with Gavin.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  It's just so funny.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  I recommend, boys, that you make me the ace of spades because I have a tattoo of it.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  I mean, I mean, I love Gavin, but it should be Trump.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  He deserves it.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  I like Gavin too.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  Yeah, he does.
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  But I mean, Trump is the ace of spades.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  Don't we even saying that for a year and a half.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  Trump is the ace of spades.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  Let's put him up on screen.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  But I would imagine you're gonna have more permutations, aren't you?
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  Well, we thought about it, but like one of the things with the printing is like,
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  whenever you send in the final art, it's kind of locked in because they create a plate
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  and then they press the plate down like on the sheet.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  So like any changes that we would want to make to the deck would be like a lot more costly
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  than just like sending another print through because of the way it works as a setup.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  No, I'm impressed.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  I want to have you guys back on.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  And like I said, send me some of the posters you've got as well.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  Very, very honored to be the ace of diamonds.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  And I appreciate your work, gentlemen.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  Again, GetTrump.Cards.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  I didn't know they had a card URL.
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  That's kind of...
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  Yeah, that's relatively new.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  Get this out of us.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  I'm gonna get an InfoWars card right now, folks. Let's get it.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  First of all, I already grabbed it.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  I can take it away though, folks.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  Listen, I appreciate you guys.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  Great job.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  We also have the cards available.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  Have a great Christmas, my friends.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  All right, thanks.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  You too.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  We'll have you back up.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  All right.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  I want the posters.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000]  That's what looks cool.
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000]  If you're tired of freezing your butt off, elk hunting, sitting in a tree stand, deer
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:22.000]  hunting, winter camping, fishing, ice fishing, no longer fear the cold.

[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  clean and unclog the arteries.

[02:21:44.000 --> 02:22:00.000]  And now, three recent financial memories.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  Remember the market drops of 02, the financial crisis of 08, the flash crash of 2010.
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000]  It's not if, but when.

[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  Two new T-shirts. People keep asking for an M4 Wars crew shirt.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  And we've got one for the crew and one for everybody.
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  It says infowars.com on the back with a big symbol, infowars.com on the right hand shoulder.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  And it says crew on the breast.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  We also have the Republic Defense Force that says press on it as well because it's an info war.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  So very exciting to be seen, to meet like-minded people, to come together at events and to support the info war.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  The two new shirts are available at infowarstore.com.
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  Now, going back to the serious news, and we've got the crew in the TV studio.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  We're here in the radio slash news studio, the war room.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  Massive cyber attack could trigger NATO response.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  This is from Reuters a month ago.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  We have Hillary also saying it.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  And then now we have this report from infowars.com.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  Obama threatened Putin with war over election hacking conspiracy theory.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  Of course, Putin said he got a call last week from Obama.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  Obama says he gave him a call. President used emergency red phone system to say, quote, armed conflict could ensue.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  Now, he goes through NBC reporting this and others.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  This is just incredible.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  But what's even more amazing is this is now official policy.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  So you've got the president basically threatening World War III.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  That's where this goes.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  Off of some CIA report Congress can't see.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  The head of all intelligence, Clapper says it's fake.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  I've got CIA sources that are high up and others do as well.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  This is bull.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  We told you a week before they admitted it was bull.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  It was bull.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  We told you the exact type of bull it was.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  Just like we told you Romney wasn't going to get it when they first announced it.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  I don't know who we're talking to.
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  Anyways, I can't bob with the twilight zone.
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  This might be the matrix.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  This is just too cool.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  I'm sitting there with Lee Ann Magnu.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  I'm looking at the Christmas tree here in Austin, Texas.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  We've built this operation across the enemy.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  We're just winning and winning.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  There's a total exuberance.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  The highest Gallup poll in 100 year history in history for exuberance and confidence in the economy.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  I'm just winning, winning, winning, winning Lee Ann.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  What is going on here?
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  And now Obama wants to turn it all over and have a nuclear war.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  But it's okay because he's liberal.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  So are losers.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  I don't know.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  Donald Trump said I'm not going to get tired of winning.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  Winning feels great.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  What do you think about the fact that the sore losers are now saying that no matter how deranged we have to get,
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  we must do everything we can to delegitimize Trump?
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  It's just, why don't you do a little soul searching?
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  Step back, figure out what you did to lose so badly.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  This is why we're probably going to have eight years of Trump.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  Great.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  And what do you think of?
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  What do you think of?
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  Have you seen the clip?
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  You're getting ready for the news where I play where she's on Oprah of the first tranny is on there.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  Michelle Obama and she's.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  That's what John Rivers was friends with her and said she's a tranny and then they killed her a week later.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  Probably probably killed her.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  But seriously, make sure you keep saying I first said that.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  No, John Rivers did.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  What do you think of her saying we're all just dumb toddlers?
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  You know, I haven't watched her interview yet because it just, it made me sick to my stomach.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:50.000]  Just the highlights that were coming out her saying, oh, well, we brought hope into the White House.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  And now that we're leaving, there is no hope.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  Please, are you kidding me?
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  Where is the hope?
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  The country is in dire straits.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  Look, take a look around at the globe.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  And basically you're insulting more than half the country that wanted to make America great again and got Trump in office.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  We are.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  We are filled with hope for the first time in quite a long time.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  A lot of people are.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  So, you know, to me, the globalists have been trying to demoralize us.
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  So we give up.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  Right.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  It's even in the WikiLeaks where they wanted to moralize us.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  These people are so creepy.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  It's everything is opposite.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  It's the double speak.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  You know, let me ask you a serious question.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  We have hope.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  The photos of her in the dresses with the big bulge, with, you know, the Ataconda.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  I mean, I'm being serious here.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  Do you think she really could be a man?
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  Because he admits he was raised by training Indonesia.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  There's all this weird stuff.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  Well, do you think John Reimers said she's a trainee and then died?
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000]  I do not believe Michelle Obama has a cot piece.
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  I don't believe it.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  So then what is the giant bulge?
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  I think it's fake news.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  I don't know.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  Maybe she has incontinence or something.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  I don't know.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  Oh, a diaper.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  I don't know.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  Do you know what I'm doing right now?
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  I'm unsure.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  I am.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  I am trolling the MSM.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  You understand that?
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  I want the big story over Christmas to be.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  Alex Jones, the fake news guy says she, you know, says she's long gone silver.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  Long done.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  Family show.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  Family show.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  What?
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  I'm talking about Long John Silver.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  Yeah.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  Ever seen that story?
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  Treasure Island?
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  Ever seen that movie?
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  I'm going to stop.
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  I'm going to stop.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  I'm trolling media.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  I apologize.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  Lord, I repent.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  They're going to take everything out of context.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  Sorry.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  Sorry.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  I can't wait to get to this actual fake news topic.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  That was satire media.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  That was satire.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  So you don't think Michelle Obama has a cot piece?
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  No.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  She just looks like a man like Rachel Maddow.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  It's nothing wrong with that.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  Mysteries in the universe.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  She says we're toddlers.
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  Okay.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000]  Well, I can say mommy, that looks like a man.
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:58.000]  Look, mommy, it has a wee wee.
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.000]  As reported by the Daily Mail, yet another Russian diplomat is found dead.
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:07.000]  This one at his home in Moscow just hours after the reports came of the assassination
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000]  of the Russian ambassador in Ankara, Turkey.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000]  Peter Pulsikov, 56 years old.
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:14.000]  He was found dead from a gunshot wound in his own home.
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000]  He's reported to be a senior figure in Russia for the Latin American Department of Foreign
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000]  Ministry.
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  And here's what we know.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:25.000]  This high-ranking Russian diplomat, he was found with gunshot wounds to the head, 56
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  years old, in his own home.
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000]  The shooting was disclosed by Wren TV.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  The news breaking shortly after the report coming of the assassination of the Russian
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  ambassador to Ankara, Andrei Karlov.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  Now, the circumstances of this shooting remain very unclear.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  But what we do know is that police are examining all possible motives to his death.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  Two empty bullet wounds were found in the apartment in Belosky Prospect, and a gun was
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000]  discovered under the sink and the bathroom as reported by Wren TV.
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:55.000]  Your latest update on the second assassination of a Russian diplomat in a spade of 48 hours.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:24.000]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.

[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  Every time I get a chance, I listen to Roger Stowe on Infowars. Roger's a badass MF.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:43.000]  Thank you, that wasn't really the Reverend Al Sharpen, but it sure sounded like him. Thanks for joining me again on Infowars, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:56.000]  Two terrific appointments that aren't getting the kind of attention I think it needs, and I think answers the question that there are not loyal Trumpites be appointed to the administration.
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  One is Monica Crowley, friend of mine of many years, a former top aide to former President Richard Nixon.
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  A young woman who is a terrific writer, a non-globalist, a Trump supporter from the beginning, now going over to essentially be the director of information for the national security apparatus,
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  and then also very happy to hear about, there she is, stunning, smart, and enormously capable. This could be one of Donald Trump's greatest hires.
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:42.000]  And then the other person, frankly, I'm most excited about is Larry Kudlow. Larry Kudlow played a central role in the formulation of Donald Trump's economic plan to move this country forward.
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:48.000]  He is a proponent of growth. He is a proponent of cutting the corporate tax rate.
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:35:04.000]  He understands that the same tactics that President John F. Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan used to move the economy forward through tax reduction can work again, and President Trump should not be talked out of his radical plan to move this economy.
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  With Larry Kudlow there, I don't believe he will be.
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:20.000]  On the downside, I have read about the potential appointment of Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations to the number two position at the State Department for a myriad of reasons.
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  I think this is a terrible idea. Let's keep an eye on that story and see if that really happens.
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:38.000]  Now I want to turn to John Hagerty, who joined me several days ago on the Stone Cold Truth radio show, an incredible interview that I really wanted to go into here.
[03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  John Hagerty is among the most respected and knowledgeable experts on election law and recounts.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  And it was John Hagerty with a team of others, real professionals, who were sent to Wisconsin to manage the Jill Stein-generated Hillary Clinton-backed George Soros-funded recount.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:01.000]  So John Hagerty, welcome to Infowars. Great to have you today.
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  Good afternoon, Roger. It's a pleasure to join you again.
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  So lay out for our listeners exactly what happened in Wisconsin and then give us a taste of Michigan and Pennsylvania, because based on everything I have read, the Clintonites with Jill Stein fronting for them never presented any evidence whatsoever of irregularities or undervotes, overvotes, nothing.
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  Their entire complaint was based on two incredible arguments, one that the machines could be hacked when I said that before the election, they tried to crucify me, and that the polls didn't match the final results, so the final results must be wrong.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  Take it away, John Hagerty.
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:37:03.000]  Well, that is correct, Roger. This was a baseless recount, and let me give you some background before we go to the specific states. So even though it's a federal election, state law controls the conduct of elections in each state, and each state is a little different in how they do things.
[03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  So in Wisconsin, Wisconsin allows for a recount for any candidate if they're willing to pay a fee, and the fee is calculated on the number of votes and what the cost would be. So Jill Stein paid a fee of about $4 million to have a recount, even though she was the fourth place candidate in Wisconsin.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:45.000]  And she remained the fourth place candidate even after the recount was over. So what she did was she dragged these hard-working board of elections officials, employees, who had just worked four months on a presidential election, and made them come in during the holiday season and spend 12 to 14 hours a day to recount the election in time for the electoral college.
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  The election system in Wisconsin is very professional, very professionally run, and in the end of the day, Donald Trump gained 131 votes, and Jill Stein gained about 60 votes.
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  And to give you an idea, we're talking out of over 3 million votes cast in Wisconsin, which that change translates into.006% change, which is nothing.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:34.000]  So even though she paid the fee, it required taxpayer costs to do this recount, and it comes out in the end of the day to nothing. They really had no allegations. This was conjecture and pie-in-the-sky belief, desperation trying to, because they were refused to accept Donald Trump as the president and that he had won Wisconsin.
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  Jill Stein's people started this recount, and Hillary people participated, and it was obvious to us that there was some collusion and coordination going on, but the Democratic officials conducting the election thought it was a waste of time.
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:59.000]  So Wisconsin, the machines really couldn't be hacked in the sense they're not networked. These are paper ballots that are scanned by a machine.
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  So in the end of the day, what this recount did was it proved the accuracy of this system in Wisconsin, because there was such minor, minor change in the numbers.
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:16.000]  So basically what you had is you probably had some ballots that the machine couldn't read or the ink was too light, but it showed how accurate the system really is.
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:31.000]  So in the end of the day, Wisconsin conducted the whole recount really for nothing, and I hope the one thing Wisconsin does is change their state law so that there has to be some kind of mathematical trigger for candidates to obtain a recount.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  Like in New York state, for instance, it's statutory. Candidates have to be within one half of one percent to get a recount. It's not court ordered. It's not pay a fee. If it's within one half of one percent, it's that close. It's an automatic recount, and you can't get a recount any other way, and that's probably what they should consider in Wisconsin.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:49.000]  Now let's go to Michigan.
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  Yes, please.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  Go ahead, Roger. I'm sorry.
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:53.000]  Tell us about Michigan.
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  Let's go to Michigan. So Michigan, again, there were no specific allegations, and what really happened is the recount started for four days until the court stopped it, realizing what a farce it was.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  So I was in Wayne County, which is Detroit, and what you really saw in Wayne County in Detroit was irregularities that were really much that helped Hillary.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:32.000]  You found that 37% of the city of Detroit's precincts tabulated more ballots than the number of actual voters that signed in the poll book, which is always an indication of something is wrong.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  But this wasn't hacking or post-it. What this was was stuffing the ballot box for Hillary.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:52.000]  And so the way Michigan State law works is that a precinct cannot be recounted if the number of ballots doesn't equal the number of people in the poll book.
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:56.000]  Because if there's more ballots than people in the poll book, that means someone added ballots in afterwards.
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  And these are all precincts that were Hillary won 90 to 95%.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  So the way Michigan State law is that it can't be recounted, that the election results on election night stand. And that's what happened in Michigan.
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  The state court ruled that Jill Stein had no ability to bring this proceeding, that she was not in a grieve candidate in any way, that it wasn't possible for her to win,
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:26.000]  and that she offered absolutely no proof to the court or the boards of election that something had happened.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:39.000]  She was trying to make assumptions, and in fact, what will come out of this now is the state board of elections will conduct an audit onto Wayne County to see if it was human error or if it was actual fraud,
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:43.000]  or negligence for the mismatch of regularities in Detroit.
[03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  And very often, in presidential elections with a lot of ballots, you have election day workers who work long hours and are poorly trained, and they make a mess of it.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  And pretty much that's what happened in Detroit.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:04.000]  But again, no one was hacking any machines, no one was doing anything except maybe stuffing the ballot box a little bit, but again, a Hillary's favor.
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  So in the end of the day, again, Donald Trump won Michigan.
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  All right, so the big three in their trifecta was Pennsylvania, a little more complicated, but tell us about that.
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  Yep, well, Pennsylvania, again, Trump beat Clinton in about 44,000 votes out of 6 million cast, or less than 1%.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  So again, what they did was, again, Pennsylvania state law is different than Michigan or Wisconsin.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:40.000]  They allowed them to take a random sampling of some districts to see if there were irregularities.
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:45.000]  And then if there are regularities or there are issues, then a court can allow a fuller recount.
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:48.000]  But they weren't able to show any irregularity.
[03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  They weren't able to show anything that mattered that a recount should be conducted.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:43:00.000]  So when the game time to put up or show up, the Jill Stein people, in some ways, the Hillary people, couldn't prove anything.
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:07.000]  You know, the judge actually called the suspicion of a hacked Pennsylvania election borders on the irrational.
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  And this whole thing was designed.
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  It's really ironic that Jill Stein and also Hillary Clinton, and we actually created the term Clinton Stein in Wisconsin,
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:29.000]  we would call it the Clinton Stein recount, that all they wanted to do was prevent these states from participating in the electoral college.
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:30.000]  That's what it was.
[03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:39.000]  It was actually to deprive voters in these states of their ability as a state to conduct their votes at the electoral college.
[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:45.000]  So it's total hypocrisy on their part because Jill Stein supporters knew they were never going to win anything.
[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  They just wanted to muck up the process and to try and cost Donald Trump electoral votes.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  And it's a shame.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:59.000]  The good part is, in Wisconsin, the recount was conducted and finished on time so the electoral college could vote.
[03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  In Michigan, the courts, both federal and state courts, put an end to it and the board of campuses did.
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:07.000]  And in Pennsylvania, the court didn't buy, didn't take the bait from Jill Stein.
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:10.000]  So the good part is that the process worked.
[03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  If you look since 2000, the Bush Gore recount, many changes have been made in the election system.
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  There's only been a very handful of close, big elections.
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  And those handful were, you're talking about after a recount were decided by less than three or 400 votes.
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:36.000]  In all of these states, you're talking tens of thousands of votes margin, yet we're still having recounts when everybody knows nothing is going to change.
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:47.000]  So the good part about these recounts is they showed that the improvements made to the election system after Bush Gore have actually worked and made the election system better.
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  When they talk about Russian hacking, the Russian hacking is into campaign emails, John Podesta's emails.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  The election systems themselves are really not connected to the Internet.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  And what these systems do is actually count paper ballots.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  They're scanning paper ballots.
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:08.000]  So in a situation where there was some question, you could go back and count the paper ballots.
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  Even the proof that the Russians were hacking emails is thin, to say the least.
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  We now know definitively that the famous DNC emails in internal documents came from a leaker, not from the Russians.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:26.000]  I mean, it's time to put that canard to bed.
[03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:38.000]  As you know, John, six Democratic parties sued Donald Trump and I in federal court, arguing that we had a massive plan to intimidate minority voters at the polling places.
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:45.000]  That lawsuit went all the way to the Supreme Court who denied to hear it, declined to hear it.
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:46:01.000]  But after defeating David Boyce, who was the hapless attorney who ran the Gore 2000 recount, we had to go into court simultaneously in six states on the same day.
[03:46:01.000 --> 03:46:03.000]  That's six different sets of lawyers.
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:10.000]  We are still paying off a legal debt. If you want to help, you can go to stopthesteel.org.
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  We have a small debt there.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:24.000]  We intend to pay everybody and all of our lawyers because these folks did yeoman service and our election day operations were unimpeded after the court spoke long and clear,
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:35.000]  saying that Donald Trump and Roger Stone had no plan to intimidate or otherwise harass minority voters or anyone else.
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:40.000]  Let me take a quick break here and we'll come back to John Haggerty.
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:54.000]  I want to remind folks that Christmas will be upon us here shortly and theinfowars.com store has some amazing products at slash prices for this particular Christmas.
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:47:12.000]  The new super blue fluoride free toothpaste is $9.95. It's a deep discount. This stuff has been successfully researched across the board and it doesn't have fluoride, which has many reported drawbacks.
[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:25.000]  This is a pure, effective, naturally based toothpaste and if you are like me, an occasional cigar smoker, you need this product.
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  Now, this has peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and several other proprietary ingredients that make this an absolute bargain.
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  So for this Christmas, for your stocking, jump over to theinfowars.com store as soon as we are finished and load up on this terrific product.
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  You can also get a brain force. You can get a number of other fine products and of course the Trump is my president t-shirt we spoke to about later earlier.
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:48:10.000]  So, John Haggerty, back to you. What is your feeling about the Trump cabinet? I know that you are a longtime Republican activist in New York and that you were early Trump.
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  How do you see the early appointments?
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  Oh, I think it's great. I think that most Republicans I know and Trump supporters I know that are Republicans are very enthusiastic that he is keeping his word and picking people from outside the establishment or outside of the box.
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:37.000]  I mean, you look at the quality of the military people he selected to serve in his cabinet. They are incredible people.
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:48.000]  You look at the business experience of many of the business people. This is outside experience. This is common sense, everyday management type experience.
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  It's not bureaucratic, politicians, insider Washington type people and that's what I think the voters wanted.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  That's what this type of experience.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  I'm in agreement, John. I think that the appointment of Rick Perry to energy is a perfect fit. I have long been a fan of Rick Perry. He has tremendous record on energy issues and job creation in Texas and I think this is the right job for him.
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  Trump letting bygones be bygones with a real conservative and putting him on the team I think is a great appointment.
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  Larry Kudlow as I indicated which I believe is in the pipeline is the chairman of the Council on Economic Advisors would be an excellent appointment.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:48.000]  Monica Crowley, a superb appointment, an old pal of mine from the Nixon days, an exceptionally able person, a non-globalist, a nationalist, someone who gets the big picture.
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:50:02.000]  I'm very happy about Linda McMahon. This is somebody who's actually run a business. She's ideal for SBA where I think the Trump administration really needs to put a giant effort on small business and minority business enterprise.
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  Steve Mnuchin I think is a reflection of Trump. Doesn't bother me that he was once at Goldman. Doesn't bother me that Bannon was once at Goldman. Doesn't bother me that this fellow Gary Cohn was once at Goldman.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  Trump has made this clear. It's his agenda. The people at Goldman Sachs have some enormously capable people, but make no mistake about it. The agenda is the Trump agenda, not the Goldman Sachs agenda.
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:32.000]  Of that, I am most confident.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:48.000]  So, John Haggerty, thanks for joining us here at the Stone Cold Truth. We're going to talk in the last segment about Mr. Stone's international best and dressed list, which will be out January 1st, and you're never going to guess who's on it.

[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  John Haggerty told us the truth about the Wisconsin recount. Jacob Engels filled us in on the attempts of censorship of the families whose loved ones died in the Pulse nightclub attack by Islamic terrorists.
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:55:18.000]  And of course, the latest on the key Trump appointments is no secret to my friends that I am hunkered down in Florida working furiously to finish the manuscript for the making of the president 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated an American Revolution.
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:42.000]  Now, folks, this book is blunt. It is factual. It is documented. It is historic. And it is revelatory in terms of how Donald Trump, with the assistance of the alternative media, pulled off the greatest upset victory in U.S. political history.
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:53.000]  So you can go to Amazon.com. You can go to Barnes & Noble. Shortly, I believe you'll be able to go to InfoWars.com to get a great price on this book.
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:56:03.000]  You can go to the Stone Cold Truth. I want to make sure that the mainstream media cannot ignore this book, cannot ignore the truth.
[03:56:03.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  This is going to have a lot of revelations about Hillary Clinton, things you still didn't know, things that you will find outrageous and incredible, and how Donald Trump had the instincts and the guile and the cojones to face down the entire media establishment and grab the U.S. presidency.
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  And how, to this day, they will not let him have his victory. They seek to delegitimize his presidency with phony recounts, with assaults on electors, with stories calling for his impeachment in New York magazine.
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  That's what we're talking about. So I urge you to get this book now. If you are looking for additional Christmas presents, the InfoWars.com store still has copies of the Clinton's War on Women.
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  This is the definitive package on the Clintons, still relevant because it's clear to me that Clintons have not decided to go away.
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  Bill Clinton is making every excuse in the book as to why his wife lost. Oh, it was James Comey's fault. No, it was Hillary's fault. The people didn't want her. They don't like her. They don't like her record and she had no proposals.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  So you can still grab your Hillary for Prison 2016 t-shirts at InfoWars, pardon me, 2017 t-shirts at InfoWars and Stone Cold Truth because this fight, this fight is going into the new year.
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:49.000]  This fight is far, far from over and you are going to want to be in the vanguard of this movement. And if you're coming to inauguration and you're not wearing a Trump is my president t-shirt from the InfoWars store,
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:58:10.000]  well then you better be wearing a Hillary for Prison 2017 because those will be deregure in Washington DC. This is what the cool people will be wearing. So join me in Washington for the inauguration, for the deplorable and get your t-shirt today from InfoWars.
