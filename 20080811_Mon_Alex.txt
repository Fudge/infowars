[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:43.280]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones hello ladies and gentlemen
[00:43.280 --> 00:50.080]  thank you for joining us today the 11th day of August 2008 we have several important guests
[00:50.080 --> 00:56.960]  lined up for you today that I will tell you about after the break for now defiant Putin accuses us
[00:56.960 --> 01:08.480]  of helping Georgia as fighting escalates amid fears of Georgian invasion now mainstream Israeli
[01:08.480 --> 01:13.840]  newspapers are reporting and bragging that Israeli forces have been involved in the entire
[01:14.560 --> 01:19.280]  arming training and sneak attack on Russian forces Thursday night into Friday morning
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.920]  the average American that I talked to are here on talk radio or the majority of the news stories I
[01:25.920 --> 01:35.200]  see in print frame it as if Russia premeditatedly out of a clear blue sky attacked Georgia now I'm
[01:35.200 --> 01:43.040]  not even taking sides in all of this but the insulting nature of how the media they may start
[01:43.040 --> 01:50.720]  coming on the news and saying the sky is red and water is black and you know birds don't fly but
[01:50.720 --> 01:58.880]  pigs do I mean they treat us like we're so stupid and you know what we are it works like a charm
[01:58.880 --> 02:07.360]  I have been in four or five convenience stores in the last few days restaurants in newsrooms of
[02:07.360 --> 02:15.440]  a radio station I have been all over the place and I asked people well I was in a TV news studio
[02:15.440 --> 02:22.320]  last night and I asked them I say what do you think happened with Russia and they said oh yeah
[02:22.320 --> 02:30.480]  Russia's attacked Georgia I mean it's just even people in news don't know and that's why we are
[02:30.480 --> 02:35.840]  destroyed for lack of knowledge you know I joked around about it Friday but sure enough it's in
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.360]  blogs news stories people on the street think that Russia has attacked the US the state of Georgia
[02:42.160 --> 02:48.480]  in the southern United States it's it's just it's it's sometimes the ignorance the mindlessness
[02:48.480 --> 02:54.320]  the lack of connection to reality of the general public and the self-satisfied smirks on their
[02:54.320 --> 03:00.000]  faces while they waddle around like Miss South Carolina not even knowing what country she's in
[03:00.640 --> 03:06.080]  this is why we're so enslaved because the establishment knows they've had a hundred years
[03:06.080 --> 03:12.000]  to brainwash and brain damage and dumb down the public with chemicals and biologicals in the schooling
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.920]  the schooling that we are a we are a very dangerous nation we are a nation of mental retards with a
[03:21.920 --> 03:27.520]  criminal elite of pedophiles with nuclear weapons you imagine a science fiction nightmare novel
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.200]  where there is an imperial government with degenerate potbellied pedophiles running
[03:33.200 --> 03:39.680]  giant military forces and nuclear weapons with a retarded population as their servants well
[03:39.680 --> 03:42.800]  you have just described the united states there now does that mean there aren't
[03:43.360 --> 03:47.680]  50 million 60 million awake intelligent smart people out of 300 million
[03:50.480 --> 03:57.360]  no there's certainly good people in this country but we have really I don't want to get off into
[03:57.360 --> 04:04.560]  a rant about it it's just so incredible to me it just it it it hits me like a ton of bricks
[04:04.560 --> 04:15.200]  to know that we really are the dumbest most ignorant people on earth the most self-satisfied
[04:15.760 --> 04:23.360]  arrogant lazy entitled buffoons buffoons
[04:25.920 --> 04:30.160]  how dare Russia attack for no reason how dare it be disproportionate
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.360]  how dare them the Georgia didn't do anything they just snuck attack with thousands of troops
[04:35.360 --> 04:40.960]  and hundreds of tanks and jets and blew up an entire city and of 70,000 people and
[04:43.120 --> 04:46.880]  the numbers of dead are more like 5,000 now that our media spins it and says
[04:46.880 --> 04:52.480]  5,000 dead in Georgia thousands dead in Georgia as Russia attacks people say out there those
[04:52.480 --> 04:57.840]  Russians no no no see that's the spin it's Ossetia and they weren't killed by the Russians

[10:56.000 --> 11:03.520]  is the russian television and uh among them is their english speaking russia today which is
[11:03.520 --> 11:10.480]  their international media arm similar to the us and cnn it's in english and i have to say everything
[11:10.480 --> 11:17.440]  they're reporting is accurate it's it's amazing they are being honest they are being accurate they
[11:17.440 --> 11:23.280]  are seeing exactly what they're doing and what they intend uh am i saying that putin isn't corrupt
[11:23.280 --> 11:27.840]  or that russia doesn't do bad things no in fact we've been critical of russia most governments are
[11:27.840 --> 11:36.400]  evil and corrupt but russian media is telling the truth meanwhile our media is engaging in almost
[11:36.400 --> 11:45.360]  universal lying and twisting and spinning it's just so incredible to know that the criminals
[11:45.360 --> 11:50.880]  running our government launched 9-11 to know it comes out in mainstream news on msnbc and
[11:51.840 --> 11:56.800]  the new yorker magazine and everywhere else that dick cheney wanted to stage terror attacks
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.560]  just a few months ago creating fake iranian patrol boats and having navy seals attack us ships and
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.000]  the straight over moose blaming it on iran and hardly you know it we push it here it comes out
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.120]  in a few mainstream outlets and that's it uh it's just so incredible to know that now the crooks
[12:15.120 --> 12:26.240]  running our government have premeditatedly armed georgia whose military budget has gone up 30 times
[12:26.240 --> 12:32.160]  what it was just five years ago 30 times according to jane's weapons quarterly according to ci
[12:32.160 --> 12:39.200]  fact book and other groups that look at that 30 times what it was just five years ago and us
[12:39.200 --> 12:48.720]  advisors israelis attack sneak attack a russian province of osetia destroy a city of 70 000 people
[12:48.720 --> 12:55.360]  conservatively now the numbers are 5 000 dead but just whole building is buried just a midnight
[12:55.360 --> 13:01.840]  sneak attack and the average american is bumbling around if they're even aware this is going on
[13:01.840 --> 13:08.240]  there they're going them darn russians i've heard them i hope they blow the hell out of them russians

[13:22.640 --> 13:28.160]  and it's got so many super weapons that they just they're saying hey let's have a nuclear war russia
[13:28.160 --> 13:33.360]  that's what the neocons say in the pinac document that's what william crystal and and and fife and
[13:33.360 --> 13:37.680]  the rest of them say as well we got more nukes and we got better weapons so a nuclear war is
[13:37.680 --> 13:44.160]  desirable these little bastards they get to jump in the underground railway facilities that are
[13:44.160 --> 13:49.280]  all the major cities and they get to go out to the different bunkers for 5 000 and 10 000 and
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.640]  20 000 people the government admits they have well they can live under the ground for decades with
[13:54.640 --> 14:02.400]  nuclear power and everything else we don't get that but you've got these jackasses that are on

[26:58.040 --> 27:00.040]  Top ranking
[27:00.040 --> 27:04.040]  Let me put it out there very clearly, succinctly, the facts
[27:04.040 --> 27:08.040]  Thursday night on the eve of the Olympics
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.040]  Friday morning, massive attack on scores of towns in the major city
[27:12.040 --> 27:16.040]  in Ossetia, destroying almost every building in the city
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.040]  leveling them, bombing them, fighter bombers, strafing helicopters
[27:20.040 --> 27:25.040]  attacking more than 100 tanks, more than 200 armored vehicles
[27:25.040 --> 27:29.040]  close to 10,000 trips, the Georgian military backed up by Israeli
[27:29.040 --> 27:34.040]  and US special forces, mercenaries
[27:34.040 --> 27:38.040]  of course, tankers out of Ukraine that's been confirmed
[27:38.040 --> 27:40.040]  just absolute sneak attack
[27:40.040 --> 27:43.040]  trying to slaughter the Russian population
[27:43.040 --> 27:46.040]  so that they will never basically come back
[27:46.040 --> 27:49.040]  so they'll leave into Russia and never come back
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.040]  and they would go in house to house with the families hiding in their cellars
[27:53.040 --> 27:58.040]  they would go in, hear the children and women inside, throw a hand grenade in
[27:58.040 --> 28:01.040]  that's right, targeting them for genocide
[28:01.040 --> 28:05.040]  that is exactly what it is, a huge sneak attack
[28:05.040 --> 28:08.040]  imagine they'd be like people in Austin, Texas
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.040]  or say Oklahoma City sleeping in their beds and suddenly
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.040]  a military from three sides attacks you
[28:16.040 --> 28:20.040]  starts bombing your city, bombing the hospitals, bombing the TV station
[28:20.040 --> 28:24.040]  the radio stations, bombing the government buildings, bombing the police stations
[28:24.040 --> 28:27.040]  bombing the Russian military base
[28:27.040 --> 28:32.040]  rolling in, taking the city, going house to house, slaughtering everyone
[28:32.040 --> 28:35.040]  and then, boom
[28:35.040 --> 28:38.040]  comes out on the news at about 11 a.m. central
[28:38.040 --> 28:41.040]  more than 12 hours into the attack
[28:41.040 --> 28:45.040]  headline, Georgian president says Russia attacking
[28:45.040 --> 28:48.040]  and Americans around the water cooler than Russians
[28:48.040 --> 28:50.040]  I'm just sick of them
[28:50.040 --> 28:53.040]  I love George Bush, oh gosh
[28:53.040 --> 28:56.040]  that's exactly what's going on
[28:56.040 --> 28:58.040]  just absolutely disgusting
[28:58.040 --> 29:03.040]  and then BBC has headlines like thousands of civilians dead in Georgia
[29:03.040 --> 29:05.040]  after Russian attack
[29:05.040 --> 29:07.040]  then you read in the bottom of the BBC articles
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.040]  we've got stories analyzing this up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[29:12.040 --> 29:18.040]  it'll mention oh they're South Ossetians killed by the Georgians
[29:18.040 --> 29:22.040]  now I have to say the statesman actually got it right here in Austin
[29:22.040 --> 29:26.040]  first paragraph in the article said sneak attack by the Georgians
[29:26.040 --> 29:30.040]  imagine the US and Israel
[29:30.040 --> 29:32.040]  sneak attack Russia
[29:32.040 --> 29:35.040]  and then the media engages in a mass hoax
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.040]  I know I keep repeating myself, it's just so incredible
[29:39.040 --> 29:41.040]  the days we live in
[29:41.040 --> 29:42.040]  this is unprecedented
[29:42.040 --> 29:44.040]  and now the war is widening
[29:44.040 --> 29:46.040]  just as we said it could
[29:46.040 --> 29:48.040]  God help us, this could get serious

[34:10.040 --> 34:13.040]  are the most accurate news reports out there
[34:13.040 --> 34:16.040]  but just recapping what's happened
[34:16.040 --> 34:18.040]  the United States and Israel
[34:18.040 --> 34:20.040]  through the proxy state of Georgia
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.040]  with Israeli mercenaries
[34:23.040 --> 34:25.040]  US mercenaries and Ukrainian mercenaries
[34:25.040 --> 34:27.040]  also US troops by the thousands
[34:27.040 --> 34:29.040]  have been there training with them
[34:29.040 --> 34:32.040]  Marines and Army but we don't know if they're involved
[34:32.040 --> 34:35.040]  in the front line assaults
[34:35.040 --> 34:37.040]  but you have this multinational force
[34:37.040 --> 34:40.040]  basically NATO expanding into
[34:40.040 --> 34:43.040]  Eastern Europe and Central Asia
[34:43.040 --> 34:45.040]  this is right above Turkey
[34:45.040 --> 34:47.040]  there in the Black Sea trying to link up
[34:47.040 --> 34:50.040]  with the controlled areas they have in Iraq
[34:50.040 --> 34:52.040]  to make it very simple
[34:52.040 --> 34:54.040]  very short the United States Israel
[34:54.040 --> 34:58.040]  and NATO have premeditatedly
[34:58.040 --> 35:01.040]  attacked a Russian enclave
[35:01.040 --> 35:04.040]  and Russian forces that have peacefully been living
[35:04.040 --> 35:07.040]  with the other Georgians
[35:07.040 --> 35:09.040]  who had always been part of Russia
[35:09.040 --> 35:11.040]  but was taken after the fall of the Soviet Union
[35:11.040 --> 35:13.040]  and there were some areas the Soviets took
[35:13.040 --> 35:15.040]  that weren't under their control previously
[35:15.040 --> 35:17.040]  like Eastern Germany
[35:17.040 --> 35:19.040]  like Poland many other areas
[35:19.040 --> 35:21.040]  they had no business being in
[35:21.040 --> 35:23.040]  they had always been part of Russia
[35:23.040 --> 35:25.040]  for hundreds and hundreds of years
[35:25.040 --> 35:27.040]  but I digress the point here is
[35:27.040 --> 35:29.040]  there has been a premeditated
[35:29.040 --> 35:31.040]  sneak attack on Russia
[35:31.040 --> 35:33.040]  killing thousands of civilians
[35:33.040 --> 35:36.040]  in an attempt at genocide to clear out Ossetia
[35:36.040 --> 35:39.040]  they also tried to attack
[35:39.040 --> 35:41.040]  another quote breakaway republic
[35:41.040 --> 35:43.040]  that has been under the control of the Russians
[35:43.040 --> 35:45.040]  since they quote lost control in 91
[35:45.040 --> 35:47.040]  they were back in control in 93
[35:47.040 --> 35:49.040]  as part of a UN agreement
[35:49.040 --> 35:51.040]  in a demilitarized zone
[35:51.040 --> 35:53.040]  this was a out of the blue
[35:53.040 --> 35:55.040]  sneak attack
[35:55.040 --> 35:57.040]  the Russians had seen the build up in the last few weeks
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.040]  and were asking the US why they were building up forces
[35:59.040 --> 36:01.040]  why the Georgians were building up on the border
[36:01.040 --> 36:03.040]  so the Russians had moved forces
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.040]  up to their border with Georgia
[36:06.040 --> 36:09.040]  so that when the sneak attack took place
[36:09.040 --> 36:11.040]  they were able to go in and repulse the attack
[36:11.040 --> 36:13.040]  the entire time
[36:13.040 --> 36:15.040]  that the Georgian forces
[36:15.040 --> 36:17.040]  were slaughtering everyone in Ossetia
[36:17.040 --> 36:21.040]  they were squeaking and squawking about
[36:21.040 --> 36:23.040]  how dare the Russians shoot back at us
[36:23.040 --> 36:25.040]  they should just basically take their body armor
[36:25.040 --> 36:27.040]  and walk out on the street and let us kill them
[36:27.040 --> 36:29.040]  the women and children should just line up
[36:29.040 --> 36:31.040]  and let us kill them
[36:31.040 --> 36:33.040]  all those dirty Russians
[36:33.040 --> 36:35.040]  and then they continued to attack
[36:35.040 --> 36:37.040]  for the last two days
[36:37.040 --> 36:39.040]  as the Russians pushed them out of the city
[36:39.040 --> 36:41.040]  even Saturday night the Georgians were lying
[36:41.040 --> 36:43.040]  and saying they still controlled Ossetia
[36:43.040 --> 36:45.040]  and that they defeated the Russians
[36:45.040 --> 36:47.040]  while simultaneously calling for ceasefires
[36:47.040 --> 36:49.040]  and saying
[36:49.040 --> 36:51.040]  they weren't shooting at Russians
[36:51.040 --> 36:53.040]  even though there was all the live news footage
[36:53.040 --> 36:55.040]  coming out of them
[36:55.040 --> 36:57.040]  with their rocket-propelled
[36:57.040 --> 36:59.040]  self-propelled missile batteries
[36:59.040 --> 37:01.040]  and tanks still firing at the Russians
[37:01.040 --> 37:03.040]  but they know the audience they're playing to
[37:03.040 --> 37:05.040]  a complete dumb down western Europe
[37:05.040 --> 37:07.040]  and US
[37:09.040 --> 37:11.040]  they then tried to engage Russian ships
[37:11.040 --> 37:13.040]  in the Black Sea
[37:13.040 --> 37:15.040]  the Russians have been firing back at them
[37:15.040 --> 37:17.040]  the Russians have been going in
[37:17.040 --> 37:19.040]  and now attacking Georgian military bases
[37:19.040 --> 37:21.040]  that are supplying
[37:21.040 --> 37:23.040]  the Georgian military that is still engaging them
[37:23.040 --> 37:25.040]  they've also been
[37:25.040 --> 37:27.040]  basically hunting, seeking
[37:27.040 --> 37:29.040]  destroying
[37:29.040 --> 37:31.040]  the different Georgian forces
[37:31.040 --> 37:33.040]  as they regroup for counter-assaults
[37:33.040 --> 37:35.040]  on the Russians
[37:35.040 --> 37:37.040]  repulsion attacks
[37:37.040 --> 37:39.040]  that they launched trying to repel
[37:39.040 --> 37:41.040]  and successfully repelling
[37:41.040 --> 37:43.040]  Israeli-backed Georgian forces
[37:43.040 --> 37:45.040]  but the bigger
[37:45.040 --> 37:47.040]  issue here is that
[37:47.040 --> 37:49.040]  there are US mercenaries, Ukrainian mercenaries
[37:49.040 --> 37:51.040]  and Israeli mercenaries
[37:51.040 --> 37:53.040]  involved in all of this
[37:53.040 --> 37:55.040]  Israel's winet news is not a shame
[37:55.040 --> 37:57.040]  to the role Israel plays
[37:57.040 --> 37:59.040]  in arming and training Georgia's military
[37:59.040 --> 38:01.040]  in fact, according to
[38:01.040 --> 38:03.040]  Ari Egozi
[38:03.040 --> 38:05.040]  Israel is involved with
[38:05.040 --> 38:07.040]  Georgian specifically to gear its military
[38:07.040 --> 38:09.040]  up for confrontation with Russia
[38:09.040 --> 38:11.040]  for the past 7 years Israeli companies
[38:11.040 --> 38:13.040]  have been helping Georgian army
[38:13.040 --> 38:15.040]  to prepare for war against Russia
[38:15.040 --> 38:17.040]  that's the Israeli newspaper
[38:17.040 --> 38:19.040]  through arms deals, training and infantry units
[38:19.040 --> 38:21.040]  and security advice
[38:21.040 --> 38:23.040]  it sure helps that Georgia's defense minister
[38:23.040 --> 38:25.040]  David
[38:25.040 --> 38:27.040]  Kirza Vashili
[38:27.040 --> 38:29.040]  is a former Israeli who is fluent
[38:29.040 --> 38:31.040]  in Hebrew and work with Israel
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.040]  that's right, the head of their military
[38:33.040 --> 38:35.040]  is an Israeli
[38:35.040 --> 38:37.040]  his door was always open to the Israelis
[38:37.040 --> 38:39.040]  and came and offered
[38:39.040 --> 38:41.040]  his country arms systems made in Israel
[38:41.040 --> 38:43.040]  a source told winet news
[38:43.040 --> 38:45.040]  compared to countries in Eastern Europe
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.040]  the deals in this country were conducted
[38:47.040 --> 38:49.040]  fast, mainly due to the defense minister's
[38:49.040 --> 38:51.040]  personal involvement
[38:51.040 --> 38:53.040]  so see, Israel is in such control
[38:53.040 --> 38:55.040]  of Georgia that the head of their military
[38:55.040 --> 38:57.040]  is an Israeli
[38:57.040 --> 38:59.040]  former
[39:01.040 --> 39:03.040]  former Israeli
[39:03.040 --> 39:05.040]  no such thing and is their head defense minister
[39:05.040 --> 39:07.040]  some of the military
[39:07.040 --> 39:09.040]  hardware sold to Georgia includes
[39:09.040 --> 39:11.040]  remote piloted vehicles
[39:11.040 --> 39:13.040]  automatic turrets for armored vehicles
[39:13.040 --> 39:15.040]  anti-aircraft systems
[39:15.040 --> 39:17.040]  communication systems, shells and rockets
[39:17.040 --> 39:19.040]  according to Israeli sources
[39:19.040 --> 39:21.040]  former Israeli Brigadier General
[39:21.040 --> 39:23.040]  Gal Hirsch
[39:23.040 --> 39:25.040]  gave the
[39:25.040 --> 39:27.040]  Georgian army advice on the establishment
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.040]  of elite units such as the
[39:29.040 --> 39:31.040]  Sarret
[39:31.040 --> 39:33.040]  Matakal and on retirement
[39:33.040 --> 39:35.040]  and gave various
[39:35.040 --> 39:37.040]  and on rearmament
[39:37.040 --> 39:39.040]  and gave various courses
[39:39.040 --> 39:41.040]  in the field of combat intelligence
[39:41.040 --> 39:43.040]  fighting in built up areas
[39:43.040 --> 39:45.040]  so they could run a think attack on a civilian city
[39:45.040 --> 39:47.040]  Sarret
[39:47.040 --> 39:49.040]  Matakal is the
[39:49.040 --> 39:51.040]  main special forces unit in the Israeli
[39:51.040 --> 39:53.040]  defense force
[39:53.040 --> 39:55.040]  molded after the British SAS and specializes
[39:55.040 --> 39:57.040]  in counter-terrorism
[39:57.040 --> 39:59.040]  deeper reconnaissance and intelligence gathering
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.040]  counter-terrorism attacking
[40:05.040 --> 40:07.040]  South Osseti
[40:07.040 --> 40:09.040]  civilians in a bloody
[40:09.040 --> 40:11.040]  sneak attack this is incredible
[40:11.040 --> 40:13.040]  I mean what is Israel doing
[40:13.040 --> 40:15.040]  what is the United States doing
[40:15.040 --> 40:17.040]  what is the problem here
[40:17.040 --> 40:19.040]  why do the US and Israel
[40:19.040 --> 40:21.040]  have to be the bad guys
[40:21.040 --> 40:23.040]  I'm an American, I'm tired of my name
[40:23.040 --> 40:25.040]  being drugged to the mud
[40:25.040 --> 40:29.040]  country's name this is disgusting
[40:29.040 --> 40:31.040]  and it's all part
[40:31.040 --> 40:33.040]  of a larger plan ladies and gentlemen
[40:35.040 --> 40:37.040]  it's all part of this new world order
[40:39.040 --> 40:41.040]  system
[40:41.040 --> 40:43.040]  John I'm going to close my I.M.
[40:43.040 --> 40:45.040]  so you can send me those calls again okay
[40:47.040 --> 40:49.040]  those are not coming through with the calls
[40:51.040 --> 40:53.040]  never ends
[40:53.040 --> 40:55.040]  mass murder in South Osseti
[40:55.040 --> 40:57.040]  Israelis should be proud of themselves
[40:57.040 --> 40:59.040]  in Kurt Nemo's article just quotes
[40:59.040 --> 41:01.040]  Israeli newspapers
[41:05.040 --> 41:07.040]  Ari
[41:07.040 --> 41:09.040]  Egozi
[41:09.040 --> 41:11.040]  Egozi writes that
[41:11.040 --> 41:13.040]  Israel's foreign ministry
[41:13.040 --> 41:15.040]  worried about angering Russia
[41:15.040 --> 41:17.040]  with such military sales
[41:17.040 --> 41:19.040]  but Georgian minister
[41:19.040 --> 41:21.040]  Temer
[41:21.040 --> 41:23.040]  Yaakov Buzali
[41:23.040 --> 41:25.040]  said the Israelis should
[41:25.040 --> 41:27.040]  be proud of themselves for
[41:27.040 --> 41:29.040]  the Israeli training and education
[41:29.040 --> 41:31.040]  received by the Georgian soldiers
[41:31.040 --> 41:33.040]  Yaakov Buzali
[41:33.040 --> 41:35.040]  is a Jew so their foreign minister
[41:35.040 --> 41:37.040]  is Israeli too
[41:37.040 --> 41:39.040]  this is incredible folks
[41:39.040 --> 41:41.040]  their defense minister and
[41:41.040 --> 41:43.040]  their foreign minister
[41:43.040 --> 41:45.040]  and it's fluent in Hebrew
[41:45.040 --> 41:47.040]  this is reading from the Israeli newspaper
[41:47.040 --> 41:49.040]  we are now in a fight against the great Russia
[41:49.040 --> 41:51.040]  he said in our hope is to
[41:51.040 --> 41:53.040]  receive assistance from the White House
[41:53.040 --> 41:55.040]  because Georgia cannot survive on its own
[41:55.040 --> 41:57.040]  it is important that the entire
[41:57.040 --> 41:59.040]  world understands what is happening
[41:59.040 --> 42:01.040]  in Georgia now will affect the entire world
[42:01.040 --> 42:03.040]  order it is not just Georgia's business
[42:03.040 --> 42:05.040]  but the entire world's business
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.040]  you know what's going on here
[42:07.040 --> 42:09.040]  more and more it appears not only
[42:09.040 --> 42:11.040]  and again it doesn't appear
[42:11.040 --> 42:13.040]  it's a fact there was over a thousand Marines
[42:13.040 --> 42:15.040]  hundreds of Army special forces
[42:15.040 --> 42:17.040]  they admit Marines and Army special forces are currently there
[42:17.040 --> 42:19.040]  training them advising them
[42:19.040 --> 42:21.040]  not only
[42:21.040 --> 42:23.040]  increasing their military size in the last 5 years
[42:23.040 --> 42:25.040]  by 30 fold
[42:25.040 --> 42:27.040]  the US has heavily been in there for the last
[42:27.040 --> 42:29.040]  10 years but really accelerated
[42:29.040 --> 42:31.040]  the last 5 years
[42:31.040 --> 42:33.040]  Israeli for the last 7
[42:33.040 --> 42:35.040]  it appears that Israel though
[42:35.040 --> 42:37.040]  is the dominant force
[42:37.040 --> 42:39.040]  in launching this through
[42:39.040 --> 42:41.040]  their control of large sectors
[42:41.040 --> 42:43.040]  of the
[42:43.040 --> 42:45.040]  Georgian government
[42:45.040 --> 42:47.040]  and
[42:47.040 --> 42:49.040]  basically leading the United States
[42:49.040 --> 42:51.040]  around by the nose
[42:51.040 --> 42:53.040]  we know Israel once control of the Middle East
[42:53.040 --> 42:55.040]  and for all intents and purposes
[42:55.040 --> 42:57.040]  Georgia is in the Middle East
[42:57.040 --> 42:59.040]  I mean it's right on the border of it
[42:59.040 --> 43:01.040]  right above Turkey, right on the Black Sea
[43:01.040 --> 43:03.040]  and then it borders
[43:03.040 --> 43:05.040]  some of the Kurdish areas
[43:05.040 --> 43:07.040]  it borders some of the Stans
[43:07.040 --> 43:09.040]  and Armenia
[43:09.040 --> 43:11.040]  and
[43:13.040 --> 43:15.040]  if I sound like I'm at a loss for words
[43:15.040 --> 43:17.040]  it shows incredible
[43:17.040 --> 43:19.040]  Bravada
[43:19.040 --> 43:21.040]  Hutzpah
[43:21.040 --> 43:23.040]  arrogance
[43:23.040 --> 43:25.040]  just
[43:25.040 --> 43:27.040]  incredibly self-confident
[43:27.040 --> 43:29.040]  to have the United States and Israel
[43:29.040 --> 43:31.040]  arm Georgia the teeth and have them
[43:31.040 --> 43:33.040]  sneak attack and mass murder
[43:33.040 --> 43:35.040]  towns and cities
[43:35.040 --> 43:37.040]  and engaging
[43:37.040 --> 43:39.040]  classic genocide going house to house
[43:39.040 --> 43:41.040]  throwing hand grenades in on families
[43:43.040 --> 43:45.040]  and then to have Israel
[43:45.040 --> 43:47.040]  involved in all of this it's just
[43:47.040 --> 43:49.040]  it's out of control
[43:49.040 --> 43:51.040]  it is completely and totally
[43:51.040 --> 43:53.040]  out of control
[43:53.040 --> 43:55.040]  and they are trying to start World War 3
[43:55.040 --> 43:57.040]  and now the Russians have poured in
[43:57.040 --> 43:59.040]  and of course they're not stopping
[43:59.040 --> 44:01.040]  they have to destroy the Georgian military
[44:01.040 --> 44:03.040]  because they're going to continue
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.040]  to attack on the Russian border
[44:05.040 --> 44:07.040]  I mean what would the United States do
[44:07.040 --> 44:09.040]  if a country say Canada
[44:09.040 --> 44:11.040]  attacked
[44:11.040 --> 44:13.040]  let's say
[44:13.040 --> 44:15.040]  Buffalo, New York
[44:15.040 --> 44:17.040]  right across the water from Canada
[44:17.040 --> 44:19.040]  and killed
[44:19.040 --> 44:21.040]  at least 5000 people now
[44:21.040 --> 44:23.040]  that's the newest numbers coming out
[44:23.040 --> 44:25.040]  just a sneak attack
[44:25.040 --> 44:27.040]  went into Buffalo
[44:27.040 --> 44:29.040]  went into Rochester, went house to house
[44:29.040 --> 44:31.040]  killing families, shooting women and children
[44:31.040 --> 44:33.040]  video of them running over
[44:33.040 --> 44:35.040]  children in the streets
[44:35.040 --> 44:37.040]  just hunting down and killing
[44:37.040 --> 44:39.040]  ethnic Russians
[44:41.040 --> 44:43.040]  same thing they use the Muslims to do
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.040]  in the late 90's
[44:47.040 --> 44:49.040]  against the Serbs and when the Serbs fought back
[44:49.040 --> 44:51.040]  there were counterattacks launched against them
[44:51.040 --> 44:53.040]  and the media said how dare Serbia attack
[44:53.040 --> 45:03.040]  the innocent Kosovoans
[45:03.040 --> 45:05.040]  and then you have Israel bragging
[45:05.040 --> 45:07.040]  that they have a thousand mercenaries
[45:07.040 --> 45:09.040]  former Israeli military
[45:09.040 --> 45:11.040]  that's all these mercenary groups are
[45:11.040 --> 45:13.040]  Blackwater and the rest of them
[45:13.040 --> 45:15.040]  they are just government operations folks
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.040]  but the governments then get plausible
[45:17.040 --> 45:19.040]  deniability
[45:19.040 --> 45:21.040]  I mean this is even more
[45:21.040 --> 45:23.040]  that's why they had Delta Force
[45:23.040 --> 45:25.040]  was because it was separate from the Pentagon
[45:25.040 --> 45:27.040]  and under executive national
[45:27.040 --> 45:29.040]  security council control
[45:29.040 --> 45:31.040]  well now it's just
[45:31.040 --> 45:33.040]  they just command Blackwater and they can use
[45:33.040 --> 45:35.040]  guys from death squads in Latin America
[45:35.040 --> 45:37.040]  South Africans, Americans
[45:37.040 --> 45:39.040]  British, Israelis but now it's just
[45:39.040 --> 45:41.040]  big Israeli
[45:41.040 --> 45:43.040]  merc groups
[45:43.040 --> 45:45.040]  which are just Serbs for the Israeli and US
[45:45.040 --> 45:47.040]  government in there running
[45:47.040 --> 45:49.040]  a vicious terrorist
[45:49.040 --> 45:51.040]  attack and the average American
[45:51.040 --> 45:53.040]  has been taught now oh yo we sneak attack
[45:53.040 --> 45:55.040]  people that's what the good guys do
[45:55.040 --> 45:57.040]  the good guys sneak attack
[45:57.040 --> 45:59.040]  and murder men women and children
[45:59.040 --> 46:01.040]  and then the same
[46:01.040 --> 46:03.040]  shmucks
[46:03.040 --> 46:05.040]  who were hailing all of this on talk
[46:05.040 --> 46:07.040]  radio saying yeah okay
[46:07.040 --> 46:09.040]  we did hit the Russians it's good
[46:09.040 --> 46:11.040]  they think the government is not going to hurt them
[46:11.040 --> 46:13.040]  this is lawless
[46:13.040 --> 46:15.040]  this is completely wicked
[46:15.040 --> 46:17.040]  this is truly the United States
[46:17.040 --> 46:19.040]  being the bad guys
[46:19.040 --> 46:21.040]  I mean it's not enough that we attack
[46:21.040 --> 46:23.040]  directly nothing to do with 9-11
[46:25.040 --> 46:27.040]  killed a million 200,000
[46:27.040 --> 46:29.040]  people so far
[46:29.040 --> 46:31.040]  but then shrieking hard as Russia
[46:31.040 --> 46:33.040]  defends itself from an attack
[46:33.040 --> 46:35.040]  and I'm no fan of the corrupt Russian government
[46:35.040 --> 46:37.040]  but when they're the good guys
[46:37.040 --> 46:39.040]  when our government is so evil
[46:39.040 --> 46:41.040]  and Israel is so evil that the Russians
[46:41.040 --> 46:43.040]  are the good guys it just
[46:43.040 --> 46:45.040]  flabbergaffs me
[46:45.040 --> 46:47.040]  alright I said I'd go to your calls
[46:47.040 --> 46:49.040]  you can go read the Israeli papers
[46:49.040 --> 46:51.040]  meanwhile
[46:51.040 --> 46:53.040]  Dick Cheney is threatening Russia
[46:53.040 --> 46:55.040]  we'll get to that later we have some news
[46:55.040 --> 46:57.040]  cash clips we're going to play later
[46:57.040 --> 46:59.040]  I'm going to move quickly for your calls
[46:59.040 --> 47:01.040]  John in Texas you're on the air
[47:01.040 --> 47:03.040]  how's it going? good
[47:03.040 --> 47:05.040]  thanks for taking my call Alex
[47:05.040 --> 47:07.040]  I would just like to point out that
[47:07.040 --> 47:09.040]  Americans need to confront the propaganda
[47:09.040 --> 47:11.040]  media machines
[47:11.040 --> 47:13.040]  either by calling them, writing them
[47:13.040 --> 47:15.040]  they need to tell them that we do not
[47:15.040 --> 47:17.040]  want to get involved in entangling alliances
[47:19.040 --> 47:21.040]  well this isn't an entangling alliance
[47:21.040 --> 47:23.040]  that's bad enough
[47:23.040 --> 47:25.040]  this is a sneak attack
[47:25.040 --> 47:27.040]  on civilians in the Russian military
[47:27.040 --> 47:29.040]  this is a dastardly
[47:29.040 --> 47:31.040]  war crime
[47:31.040 --> 47:33.040]  it's one thing when crimes get committed
[47:33.040 --> 47:35.040]  once a war starts
[47:35.040 --> 47:37.040]  or to have two militaries lined up and they start shooting
[47:37.040 --> 47:39.040]  but to have a midnight sneak attack
[47:39.040 --> 47:41.040]  on civilian centers
[47:41.040 --> 47:43.040]  on killing police stations
[47:43.040 --> 47:45.040]  full of police
[47:45.040 --> 47:47.040]  this is incredible
[47:47.040 --> 47:49.040]  this is an absolute worst thing
[47:49.040 --> 47:51.040]  you can do in war
[47:51.040 --> 47:53.040]  is a premeditated sneak attack
[47:53.040 --> 47:55.040]  look I don't know
[47:55.040 --> 47:57.040]  I don't know what the facts are
[47:57.040 --> 47:59.040]  as far as all the media reports
[47:59.040 --> 48:01.040]  no no it's admitted
[48:01.040 --> 48:03.040]  they admit at the bottom of all the reports
[48:03.040 --> 48:05.040]  that the US backed Georgians ran a
[48:05.040 --> 48:07.040]  premeditated sneak attack
[48:07.040 --> 48:09.040]  okay well
[48:09.040 --> 48:11.040]  if you're saying it's true
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.040]  then Americans need to
[48:13.040 --> 48:15.040]  unite come together and with one voice
[48:15.040 --> 48:17.040]  tell the media and tell their elected officials
[48:17.040 --> 48:19.040]  that we are not going to get involved
[48:19.040 --> 48:21.040]  because do you realize that we got involved
[48:21.040 --> 48:23.040]  in this conflict
[48:23.040 --> 48:25.040]  that the draft in my opinion would be
[48:25.040 --> 48:27.040]  obviously started and we would get drafted off
[48:27.040 --> 48:29.040]  to go fighting this
[48:29.040 --> 48:31.040]  in a war with an entangling alliance
[48:31.040 --> 48:33.040]  and John McCain has said
[48:33.040 --> 48:35.040]  John McCain has said
[48:35.040 --> 48:37.040]  that if there's a wider war
[48:37.040 --> 48:39.040]  in the Middle East and to Russia
[48:39.040 --> 48:41.040]  he will come up with a draft
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.040]  oh yeah well he's also asking
[48:43.040 --> 48:45.040]  for diplomatic
[48:45.040 --> 48:47.040]  pressure on Russia right now
[48:47.040 --> 48:49.040]  and that's ridiculous
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.040]  diplomatic pressure needs to be put on Georgia
[48:51.040 --> 48:53.040]  or I mean if you're
[48:53.040 --> 48:55.040]  saying it's true I mean this is unbelievable
[48:55.040 --> 48:57.040]  let me let you go John
[48:57.040 --> 48:59.040]  you know John you're a smart guy
[48:59.040 --> 49:01.040]  and you know they want to draft but I mean
[49:01.040 --> 49:03.040]  why are you believing me
[49:03.040 --> 49:05.040]  this is pretty stunning
[49:05.040 --> 49:07.040]  that you're a listener of this show and you don't know
[49:07.040 --> 49:09.040]  I'm not mad at you but we all
[49:09.040 --> 49:11.040]  need to go verify this
[49:11.040 --> 49:13.040]  go read just type
[49:13.040 --> 49:15.040]  Georgian conflict timeline
[49:15.040 --> 49:17.040]  I mean even the BBC
[49:17.040 --> 49:19.040]  and the AP and others that are twisting
[49:19.040 --> 49:21.040]  deeper in their stories
[49:21.040 --> 49:23.040]  admit how this all started
[49:23.040 --> 49:25.040]  okay US and Israeli backed
[49:25.040 --> 49:27.040]  Georgian troops
[49:27.040 --> 49:29.040]  launched a sneak attack Thursday night
[49:29.040 --> 49:31.040]  into Friday night against Georgia
[49:31.040 --> 49:33.040]  against North Georgia
[49:33.040 --> 49:35.040]  South Ossetia
[49:35.040 --> 49:37.040]  okay
[49:37.040 --> 49:39.040]  and they attack Russian military bases
[49:39.040 --> 49:41.040]  peacekeeping bases police stations
[49:41.040 --> 49:43.040]  then they took the city
[49:43.040 --> 49:45.040]  they took the city
[49:45.040 --> 49:47.040]  Russian forces
[49:47.040 --> 49:49.040]  and Osseti police were pinned down
[49:49.040 --> 49:51.040]  in their police stations and military bases
[49:51.040 --> 49:53.040]  which weren't heavily armed
[49:53.040 --> 49:55.040]  they were just peacekeeping stations
[49:55.040 --> 49:57.040]  since the agreement in 1993
[49:57.040 --> 49:59.040]  where they've been peacefully
[49:59.040 --> 50:01.040]  these were formerly
[50:01.040 --> 50:03.040]  these were formerly part of Russia
[50:03.040 --> 50:05.040]  these were
[50:05.040 --> 50:07.040]  almost purely Russian enclaves
[50:07.040 --> 50:09.040]  where in the 1991-92
[50:09.040 --> 50:11.040]  the Georgian military
[50:11.040 --> 50:13.040]  again attacked and tried to commit genocide
[50:13.040 --> 50:15.040]  against ethnic Russians
[50:15.040 --> 50:17.040]  so the Russians came in
[50:17.040 --> 50:19.040]  the UN came in they set up enclave areas
[50:19.040 --> 50:21.040]  so the Georgians couldn't kill them
[50:21.040 --> 50:23.040]  well the Georgians backed
[50:23.040 --> 50:25.040]  by the US and Israel launched a sneak attack
[50:25.040 --> 50:27.040]  Thursday into Friday morning
[50:27.040 --> 50:29.040]  okay I'm giving you the facts here
[50:29.040 --> 50:31.040]  the Russians had to move into
[50:31.040 --> 50:33.040]  these towns and cities to get the
[50:33.040 --> 50:35.040]  to save the police and military
[50:35.040 --> 50:37.040]  that were pinned down
[50:37.040 --> 50:39.040]  the Georgians busied themselves
[50:39.040 --> 50:41.040]  in killing the unarmed civilians
[50:41.040 --> 50:43.040]  while the military was pinned down
[50:43.040 --> 50:45.040]  being cowards they didn't want to fully engage
[50:45.040 --> 50:47.040]  the Russian military they sat back miles away
[50:47.040 --> 50:49.040]  launching rockets at them
[50:49.040 --> 50:51.040]  heavy rockets
[50:51.040 --> 50:53.040]  now the Russians had poured in
[50:53.040 --> 50:55.040]  and are kicking the butts of the Georgians
[50:55.040 --> 50:57.040]  and the US and the Israelis and are pushing them back
[50:57.040 --> 50:59.040]  now they do mean to suck us into a war

[51:03.040 --> 51:05.040]  giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning

[53:57.040 --> 54:21.040]  and bring in martial law
[54:21.040 --> 54:23.040]  make no mistake
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.040]  there's far too many of you dying
[54:27.040 --> 54:29.040]  the US and Israel as well as NATO
[54:29.040 --> 54:31.040]  who are running on this attack on Russia
[54:31.040 --> 54:37.040]  think that they're going to win either way
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.040]  because if Russia would have backed off
[54:41.040 --> 54:45.040]  as they did when they handed Kosovo over to the Muslims
[54:45.040 --> 54:47.040]  as they did in 79, 6 months before Russia
[54:47.040 --> 54:49.040]  invaded Afghanistan they funded
[54:49.040 --> 54:51.040]  the Mujahideen to attack
[54:51.040 --> 54:53.040]  Russian outpost again on the border
[54:53.040 --> 54:55.040]  with Afghanistan
[54:55.040 --> 54:57.040]  that's in the history books
[54:57.040 --> 54:59.040]  but the average American thinks the Russians
[54:59.040 --> 55:01.040]  just attacked Afghanistan out of nowhere
[55:01.040 --> 55:03.040]  and it's just
[55:03.040 --> 55:05.040]  because they watch Rambo folks
[55:05.040 --> 55:07.040]  they just believe bull
[55:07.040 --> 55:09.040]  they really think Hulk Hogan
[55:09.040 --> 55:11.040]  and the Iron Sheik really had a fight
[55:11.040 --> 55:13.040]  they think wrestling is real
[55:13.040 --> 55:15.040]  I've had to come to grips with the average American
[55:15.040 --> 55:17.040]  is basically like a wrestling fan
[55:17.040 --> 55:19.040]  they think Hulk Hogan is real
[55:19.040 --> 55:23.040]  they think all of this stuff is real
[55:23.040 --> 55:25.040]  and you just can't help them
[55:25.040 --> 55:27.040]  and you're never going to be able to help them
[55:27.040 --> 55:29.040]  and we're going to be enslaved
[55:29.040 --> 55:31.040]  unless the minority of us
[55:31.040 --> 55:33.040]  that can still think somehow get involved
[55:33.040 --> 55:35.040]  but I said I'd take your calls
[55:35.040 --> 55:37.040]  I'm all over the map here
[55:37.040 --> 55:39.040]  it's just so amazing
[55:39.040 --> 55:43.040]  that this is unfolding
[55:43.040 --> 55:45.040]  but Russia may have backed off
[55:45.040 --> 55:47.040]  but they didn't
[55:47.040 --> 55:49.040]  but that's not a miscalculation
[55:49.040 --> 55:51.040]  the neocons knew that either that would happen
[55:51.040 --> 55:53.040]  or Russia would pour in
[55:53.040 --> 55:55.040]  and then they could lie in the media
[55:55.040 --> 55:57.040]  to the dumbbells
[55:57.040 --> 55:59.040]  and start the cold war back over again
[56:01.040 --> 56:03.040]  and that's basically what they're doing
[56:03.040 --> 56:05.040]  and then say oh my god
[56:05.040 --> 56:07.040]  look at this big crisis
[56:07.040 --> 56:09.040]  and then they want to attack Iran
[56:09.040 --> 56:11.040]  Russia will be diverted by what's happening there
[56:11.040 --> 56:13.040]  John, no, Josh in Florida
[56:13.040 --> 56:15.040]  you're on the air, go ahead
[56:15.040 --> 56:19.040]  it's almost like you're a
[56:19.040 --> 56:21.040]  you're a conspiracy theorist for saying
[56:21.040 --> 56:23.040]  Georgia attacked Russia
[56:23.040 --> 56:25.040]  but anyway
[56:25.040 --> 56:27.040]  the Georgian president
[56:27.040 --> 56:29.040]  was on Wolf Blitzer
[56:29.040 --> 56:31.040]  on yesterday
[56:31.040 --> 56:33.040]  calling for a new world order
[56:33.040 --> 56:35.040]  yeah and I looked off
[56:35.040 --> 56:37.040]  there's nobody who loved it
[56:37.040 --> 56:39.040]  but I went to transcript
[56:39.040 --> 56:41.040]  we have it, we have it
[56:41.040 --> 56:43.040]  we're going to play it later
[56:43.040 --> 56:45.040]  but the new world order doesn't exist though
[56:47.040 --> 56:49.040]  yeah well that's what they tell you
[56:49.040 --> 56:51.040]  I'm 22, I live in South Florida
[56:51.040 --> 56:53.040]  so it's really crazy
[56:53.040 --> 56:55.040]  to talk to people my age about this stuff
[56:55.040 --> 56:57.040]  it's all about the nightlife
[56:57.040 --> 56:59.040]  and it's crazy, it's really depressing
[57:01.040 --> 57:03.040]  he also goes on to say that
[57:03.040 --> 57:05.040]  they shot down like 20 planes
[57:05.040 --> 57:07.040]  and that their military is doing great
[57:07.040 --> 57:09.040]  and like how does that happen
[57:09.040 --> 57:11.040]  you know
[57:11.040 --> 57:13.040]  it could be the United States influence
[57:15.040 --> 57:17.040]  but that's the only comment I had
[57:17.040 --> 57:19.040]  they've got powerful service to air missiles
[57:21.040 --> 57:23.040]  but it doesn't matter the Russians will just
[57:23.040 --> 57:25.040]  roll in
[57:25.040 --> 57:27.040]  they've got superior force and
[57:27.040 --> 57:29.040]  chew up the U.S.
[57:29.040 --> 57:31.040]  Israeli and Georgian forces
[57:31.040 --> 57:33.040]  so when you talk to your friends about that
[57:33.040 --> 57:35.040]  do they
[57:35.040 --> 57:37.040]  do they buy the official lie that
[57:37.040 --> 57:41.040]  Russia just attacked out of the clear blue sky?
[57:41.040 --> 57:43.040]  well well most of the people I talk to
[57:43.040 --> 57:45.040]  but I mean I've had the same
[57:45.040 --> 57:47.040]  same group of people I've known for like
[57:47.040 --> 57:49.040]  10 years so
[57:49.040 --> 57:51.040]  I've made that my number one priority
[57:51.040 --> 57:53.040]  in 2002 I woke up
[57:53.040 --> 57:55.040]  and basically my goal is
[57:55.040 --> 57:57.040]  to wake up the people I'm closest with
[57:57.040 --> 57:59.040]  and my family and stuff
[57:59.040 --> 58:01.040]  and I've done a pretty good job with that
[58:01.040 --> 58:03.040]  but it's just crazy to see how the masses
[58:03.040 --> 58:05.040]  flock towards
[58:05.040 --> 58:07.040]  such garbage
[58:07.040 --> 58:09.040]  that's out there
[58:09.040 --> 58:11.040]  but that was my only comment
[58:11.040 --> 58:13.040]  him calling for the world order twice
[58:13.040 --> 58:15.040]  and saying that there's a bigger
[58:15.040 --> 58:17.040]  thing involved and it's pretty scary
[58:17.040 --> 58:19.040]  well we've got
[58:19.040 --> 58:21.040]  coming up at 8 after for about 30 minutes
[58:21.040 --> 58:23.040]  Amy Allen

[58:27.040 --> 58:29.040]  coming up for about 25-30 minutes
[58:29.040 --> 58:31.040]  but then I'm going to continue with your calls

[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:45.040]  you're on the air Richard
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:47.040]  hello hello Alex I just
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:49.040]  I think world war 3 started
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:51.040]  on 888 I just
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.040]  I can't believe they did it
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:55.040]  it's not going to be good
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:57.040]  for America
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:00:59.040]  what I'm calling about
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:01.040]  but good old boys will be able to strut around
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:03.040]  by their trucks and
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:05.040]  and act tough I mean isn't that important
[1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:07.040]  they'll act tough until the neutron cloud
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:09.040]  kills them
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:11.040]  and they're swept into mass graves
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:13.040]  and they're burned and they're blind
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:15.040]  and America's re-inhabited
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:17.040]  by people from China
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:19.040]  because that's what that's what we're headed toward
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:21.040]  with this
[1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:23.040]  and what they're doing is they're
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:25.040]  everybody knows that
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:27.040]  Georgia attacked them with
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:29.040]  with American health
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:31.040]  and it's going back to this aggressive
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:33.040]  they're creating aggressive history
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:35.040]  of America so when it happens to us
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:37.040]  when the reflex happens
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:39.040]  that everybody will agree
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:41.040]  well they just had it coming to them
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:43.040]  no I agree in fact I was going to get to that later
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:45.040]  I was just covering the facts earlier
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:47.040]  but we're definitely being set up
[1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:49.040]  it's a script it is a script
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:51.040]  it is so horrible
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.040]  yeah and I mean I listened to
[1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:55.040]  a guy from Chatham house last night
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.040]  and he was
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:01:59.040]  he was backing up the company you know the neocon
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:01.040]  line that oh well Georgia
[1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:03.040]  was just trying to eradicate some
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:05.040]  some terrorist of course and all this
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:07.040]  and so that tells me it's the neocons
[1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:09.040]  aren't acting alone they're just being
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:11.040]  the the bad cop
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:13.040]  for the well
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:15.040]  Chatham house is rural
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:17.040]  economic affairs they're the father of the CFR
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:19.040]  so we're talking about the highest
[1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:21.040]  power of the Anglo-American establishment
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:23.040]  is behind this and that means that they're
[1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:25.040]  taking America down
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:27.040]  because they know they can't control America
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:29.040]  so they're going to take it down
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:31.040]  and this is right the British elite
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:33.040]  are all behind this you know why
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:35.040]  BP owns that pipeline
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:37.040]  yeah well I mean
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:39.040]  yeah you're right
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:41.040]  I mean I just I can't
[1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:43.040]  but the one there is a one silver lining
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:45.040]  about this
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:47.040]  is that the Chinese and the Russians remember
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:49.040]  well the Chinese remember the opymores
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:51.040]  they know the British East India tea company
[1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:53.040]  did that they know who was in charge of that
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:55.040]  the Russians know who put Ruben
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:02:57.040]  Steen in power that killed
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.040]  millions of their own kids and Stalin
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:01.040]  they know who did that and so what they're
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:03.040]  going to do if this goes down
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:05.040]  like they plan and this is why I can't
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:07.040]  believe the Anglo-American establishment
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:09.040]  is doing this because they're killing themselves
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:11.040]  those the Chinese and Russians
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:13.040]  are going to hunt the the Rockefellers
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:15.040]  and the Rothschilds and the Bushes
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:17.040]  and all the weak need guys
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:19.040]  that have caused the war since about
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:21.040]  the 1700s that have run
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:23.040]  this whole place
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.040]  and they're going to exterminate the families
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:27.040]  to the third cousin
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:29.040]  every one of these and that's the one
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:31.040]  silver lining is there won't be any
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:33.040]  remembrance of Rothschilds or Roth
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:35.040]  I'm telling you because the Chinese
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:37.040]  and the Russians don't need those guys
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:39.040]  and they know they don't need them
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:41.040]  and that's what they're going to do
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:43.040]  these guys are going to be in their bunkers
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:45.040]  and the Chinese troops will just gas them
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:47.040]  they'll just gas the bunkers they'll just
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:49.040]  I can't believe it I can't believe
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:51.040]  that Anglo-American establishment is doing it
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:53.040]  they think they're cutting off

[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:57.040]  power they are completely
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:59.040]  power mad and they
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:01.040]  want to destroy the U.S. as much as
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:03.040]  they want to destroy Russia they think
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:05.040]  they're going to be able to manage all of this
[1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:07.040]  and control all of this they've got spies
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:09.040]  in the Russian government the Chinese government
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:11.040]  they think they're going to be able to manage it
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:13.040]  they have succeeded so many times
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:15.040]  they've got their underground bases
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:17.040]  they've got their super weapons
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:19.040]  they've got a lot of aces in the hole
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:21.040]  and they know they're going to be able to hurt the American people
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:23.040]  very badly while the good old boys

[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:41.040]  up on night feels open happy
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:43.040]  but the days are overlapping

[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:15.040]  the revolution
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:17.040]  he's got the Ron Paul revolution song as well
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:19.040]  she's had
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:21.040]  big hits and
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:23.040]  Grammy nominated songs going back many years
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:25.040]  and really her bio is so lengthy
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:27.040]  it's probably better just to bring her up
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:29.040]  and
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:31.040]  let her
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:33.040]  tell you about herself
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:35.040]  Amy thanks for coming on with us today
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:37.040]  hey thanks so much for having me
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:39.040]  it's a pleasure
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:41.040]  I love Alex Jones
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:43.040]  well you're nice to say that
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:45.040]  we love your music as well
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:47.040]  tell us a little bit about yourself
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:49.040]  your music career
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:51.040]  television career
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:53.040]  and then you're awakening to the larger
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:55.040]  new world order that's now
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:57.040]  for years been influencing your music
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:09:59.040]  and some of the censorship you ran into
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:01.040]  well I
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.040]  got a record deal
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:05.040]  about 7 years ago on the lecture record
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:07.040]  and
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:09.040]  I did an album
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:11.040]  and the title of the album
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:13.040]  was called I'd Start a Revolution
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:15.040]  if I could get up in the morning
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:17.040]  but on my website
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:19.040]  there was a
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:21.040]  big banner that said start a revolution
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:23.040]  and there were many
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:25.040]  political people on there
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:27.040]  a lot of politically minded people on there
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:29.040]  talking about revolution
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:31.040]  and then 9-11 happened
[1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:33.040]  and the CIA called
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:35.040]  and said due to national security
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:37.040]  we can't have you talking about starting a revolution
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:39.040]  and then shortly thereafter
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:41.040]  let's not just glaze over that to be clear
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:43.040]  and they admittedly called TV networks
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:45.040]  and others the CIA called
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:47.040]  electro records one of the biggest out there
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:49.040]  same folks that bring you Metallica
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:51.040]  and they said
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:53.040]  do not put her music out
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:55.040]  well it was
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:57.040]  do not talk about revolution
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:59.040]  more specifically
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:01.040]  it wasn't necessarily about the music
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:03.040]  they didn't like what I was talking about
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:05.040]  they didn't like what the message board was talking about
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:07.040]  the message of the board
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:09.040]  so yeah that was
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:11.040]  it was shocking
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:13.040]  I was really shocked by it
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:15.040]  but it was my first run in
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:17.040]  I was kind of astounded
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:19.040]  but yeah
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:21.040]  after that
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:23.040]  I couldn't really believe it and then the label folded
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:25.040]  and honestly I don't know what came first
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:27.040]  the chicken or the egg
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:29.040]  but my record did not get released
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:31.040]  did not come out
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:33.040]  that's amazing
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:35.040]  you were already awake then
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:37.040]  out of the gates but now you're really awake
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:39.040]  oh yeah
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:41.040]  there was that and then I was held hostage
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:43.040]  I couldn't sign to another label for many years
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:45.040]  so I did
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:47.040]  I wrote some songs
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.040]  for other artists
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:51.040]  and I essentially
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:53.040]  just held hostage I couldn't really move
[1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:55.040]  I couldn't find anyone else
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:57.040]  and I'm happy not signing with any other label
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:59.040]  I was happy to be independent
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:01.040]  and the message I want to say
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.040]  I'm excited I could do the Ron Paul song
[1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:05.040]  because if I was with any major labels
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:07.040]  they wouldn't let me do a political song
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:09.040]  and that's really
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:11.040]  where it's at
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:13.040]  well it certainly is
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:15.040]  when did you first hear about Ron Paul
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:19.040]  I heard about Ron Paul
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.040]  I did
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:23.040]  I watched Zeitzgeist
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:25.040]  and I watched from freedom to fascism
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:27.040]  and I got really turned on to your show
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:29.040]  and I just started
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:31.040]  you know
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:33.040]  looking more and more into
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:35.040]  everything and I just
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:37.040]  I couldn't sleep for weeks
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:39.040]  for months I was just
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:41.040]  absolutely
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:43.040]  passionate about seeking truth
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:45.040]  and once I started covering the onion
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:47.040]  it just was getting deeper and deeper and deeper
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:49.040]  and I just had to do something about it
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:51.040]  you know I had to write a song
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:53.040]  there's just no way I could
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:55.040]  not wake up and my first song
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:57.040]  my first single
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:59.040]  on MTV
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:01.040]  I'd start a revolution song
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:03.040]  that song that they did release
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:05.040]  it was all about like I'd start a revolution
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:07.040]  if I could get up in the morning
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:09.040]  so I couldn't leave that hanging
[1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:11.040]  I had to actually wake up
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:13.040]  and do something with my life
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.040]  and actually do something about
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:17.040]  oppression and injustice
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:19.040]  and comment on it because I just couldn't
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:21.040]  sit by and do nothing
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:23.040]  there's just no way
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:25.040]  I can watch our country lose its sovereignty
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:27.040]  enough and at least write a song about it
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:29.040]  you know what's your take on
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:31.040]  the deteriorating situation in Georgia
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:33.040]  with Russia
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:35.040]  well it scares the hell out of me
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:37.040]  but I you know
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:39.040]  which is why Rob Paul would be a perfect president
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:41.040]  with his non interventionist foreign policy
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:43.040]  but
[1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:45.040]  I'm scared that we're gonna get involved
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:47.040]  and then
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:49.040]  you know people are gonna just do a fear vote
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:51.040]  and vote for McCain because
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.040]  we're in a war
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:55.040]  well I think that may be the plan
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:57.040]  they kept talking about
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:13:59.040]  in open Republican memos
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:01.040]  and of course in strategy papers
[1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:03.040]  and in editorials
[1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:05.040]  and McCain's advisors said that
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:07.040]  a war would help him or a terror attack
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:09.040]  would help him and then had to step down
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:11.040]  for speaking the truth openly
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:13.040]  what they were talking about
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:15.040]  but the the New World Order loves
[1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:17.040]  to throw curveballs and then having
[1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.040]  US and Israeli backed
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:21.040]  Georgians also backed by Ukraine
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:23.040]  sneak attack Russians
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:25.040]  and Russian citizens
[1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:27.040]  and kill them in mass
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:29.040]  thousands and thousands
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:31.040]  that's a big story in and of itself
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:33.040]  and now Russia entering the country
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:35.040]  and widening the conflict
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:37.040]  because they have to stamp out the Georgian military
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:39.040]  that's still firing at them
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:41.040]  but the bigger issue is the fact that our media
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:43.040]  has put out the hoax
[1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:45.040]  that Russia attacked Georgia
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:47.040]  it's just unbelievable
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:49.040]  yes that's the hoax
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:51.040]  that's what's going on
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:53.040]  and the internet censorship thing that you're talking about
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:55.040]  the videos and the thing that you're doing
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:57.040]  about getting people to
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:14:59.040]  step up and expose
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:01.040]  the censorship
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:03.040]  I just think it's brilliant
[1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:05.040]  I think it's absolutely great
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:07.040]  I wish I could be involved
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:09.040]  because there's just so much
[1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:11.040]  I mean like last night
[1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:13.040]  yesterday you were talking about
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:15.040]  how the average American thinks that
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:17.040]  Georgia's throwing peaches
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:19.040]  awake, they're just not aware
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:21.040]  and people need to wake up
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:23.040]  well that's amazing
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:27.040]  tell us about some of the latest music
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:29.040]  you've come out with
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:31.040]  you just released a new album haven't you
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:33.040]  well no I
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:35.040]  wrote, you know, I've written several songs
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:37.040]  for several artists
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:39.040]  like Unwritten Law
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:41.040]  Kevin Michael
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:43.040]  Matt Dusk
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:45.040]  songs I've written for other artists
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:47.040]  I've written my album right now
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:49.040]  as we speak
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:51.040]  and it's like nothing I've ever done before
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:53.040]  it's very organic, it's very raw
[1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:55.040]  it's beautiful
[1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:57.040]  and it's not so
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:15:59.040]  it's not so
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:01.040]  I used to
[1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:03.040]  not be sober like years ago
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:05.040]  and in my life now I'm sober
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:07.040]  because I want to stay alert
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:09.040]  and I want to stay tuned in
[1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:11.040]  to just
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:13.040]  the truth
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:15.040]  I'm sober, I'm focused
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:17.040]  and I want to wake others up
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:19.040]  and to
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:21.040]  shine my light and bring beauty and love
[1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:23.040]  and hope and that's really what
[1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:25.040]  my new record is about
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:29.040]  tell us about the big rally
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:31.040]  for the Republic coming up that you're going to be one of the key people at
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:33.040]  I'm so excited
[1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:35.040]  I'm just so excited about that
[1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:37.040]  we're
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:39.040]  it's going to be at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:41.040]  September 2nd
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:43.040]  and we are going to
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:45.040]  rally for the Republic
[1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:47.040]  quite literally
[1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:49.040]  and we're going to sing like a 40 minute set
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.040]  and there's going to be some
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:53.040]  surprises that I actually can't even talk about
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:55.040]  but really really fun
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:57.040]  fun stuff
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:59.040]  and I'm really excited and honored
[1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:01.040]  to be there and to be a part of it
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:03.040]  part of the revolution because that's really what it is
[1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:07.040]  well we know who is going to be there
[1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:09.040]  Jesse Ventura is going to be there, you're going to be there
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:11.040]  of course
[1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:13.040]  also Barry Goldwater Jr.
[1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:15.040]  is going to be there, very exciting
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:17.040]  I'm joking
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:19.040]  I've had him on, he's a nice guy but give me a break
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:21.040]  but Ron Paul is going to be there
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:23.040]  but the most exciting thing about it
[1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:25.040]  is that everybody is going to be there
[1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:27.040]  people who love liberty, who love freedom
[1:17:27.040 --> 1:17:29.040]  a great place to network
[1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:31.040]  something historical to be part of
[1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:33.040]  and we can steal a lot of the thunder
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:35.040]  away
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:37.040]  from the Republican National Convention
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:39.040]  that is a meeting just down the road
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:41.040]  so this is going to be huge
[1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:43.040]  I got a
[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:45.040]  very interesting message yesterday
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.040]  on my face
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:49.040]  I'm actually going to have my security team
[1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:51.040]  look into it
[1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:53.040]  but I got a threat
[1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:55.040]  yesterday
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:57.040]  on my face
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:59.040]  a good death threat
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:01.040]  well anybody who stands up for freedom
[1:18:01.040 --> 1:18:03.040]  or the American way
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:05.040]  gets death threats now
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:07.040]  and most of the time it's just
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:09.040]  it's some 14 year old kid
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:11.040]  eating hot pockets and drinking Kool-Aid
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:13.040]  but
[1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:15.040]  sometimes they do it with their tags
[1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:17.040]  on our message board or in emails
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:19.040]  they'll death threat me
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:21.040]  with their email and who they are
[1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:23.040]  and you go back to their website or their MySpace
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:25.040]  or their Facebook and they're on their death
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:27.040]  threatening there in their
[1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:29.040]  their uniform
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:31.040]  they think being patriotic
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.040]  is about not having freedoms or liberties
[1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:35.040]  not having a First Amendment
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:37.040]  living in a military dictatorship
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:39.040]  and being used
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.040]  2 or 3 or 4 tours
[1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:43.040]  and they're totally committed to this evil
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:45.040]  see they signed on to torture
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:47.040]  they signed on to preemptive war
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:49.040]  to sneak attacks
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:51.040]  and so now morally
[1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:53.040]  they have to sign on to every evil
[1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:55.040]  or admit that they're doing wrong
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:57.040]  see now evil has become good to them
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:18:59.040]  now they're only about 30%
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:01.040]  of the troops and we have all the polls
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:03.040]  and the numbers but 30% of the troops
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:05.040]  are
[1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:07.040]  what you would call the only way to describe them
[1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:09.040]  is
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:11.040]  hell's misfits I mean these are
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:13.040]  psychopathic demons
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:15.040]  who have a
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.040]  ideological overlay
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:19.040]  to their mental
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:21.040]  schizoid dysfunctional way of life
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:23.040]  and
[1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:25.040]  I mean I don't have
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:27.040]  another way to describe it but
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:29.040]  those that have any soul have been committing suicide
[1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:31.040]  and that's why there's what
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.040]  suicide rates 18 times
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:35.040]  what it's ever been in our military
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:37.040]  I mean America's basically over as we know it
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:39.040]  the only question is
[1:19:39.040 --> 1:19:41.040]  the country's on the gurney
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:43.040]  can we have an electroshock
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:45.040]  with the defibrillators to the heart

[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:28.040]  millions on good old millions on youtube
[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:30.040]  music
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:32.040]  and the whole point is
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:34.040]  so ron paul isn't going to be president
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:36.040]  we told you folks that didn't matter
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:38.040]  we asked him to run
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:40.040]  we have woken up tens of millions more americans
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:42.040]  and people worldwide
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:44.040]  about the private federal reserve
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:46.040]  about the inflation tax
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:48.040]  about what american values are really
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:50.040]  all about not preemptively
[1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:52.040]  attacking innocent countries
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:54.040]  that's why
[1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:56.040]  what happens ron paul is so important
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:58.040]  and it's still very important today
[1:24:58.040 --> 1:25:00.040]  i should add jimmy vaughn
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:02.040]  at least last time i checked
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:04.040]  is also the blues legend
[1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:06.040]  playing at the event and they told me
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:08.040]  some of the other people that are pretty much signed up
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:10.040]  but they're having to just
[1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:12.040]  finish a few of the details and believe me
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:14.040]  if you heard who you'd want to go
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.040]  but the tickets are selling out fast by the way
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:18.040]  at rallyfortherepublic.com
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:20.040]  going back to Amy Allen
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:22.040]  who again is an award winning
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:24.040]  musician in her
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:26.040]  own right who put together the ron paul song
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:28.040]  that you just
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:30.040]  heard there
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:32.040]  can you comment on
[1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:34.040]  or flesh out
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:36.040]  the point i was making or add to it
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:38.040]  or disagree with it
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:40.040]  that the ron paul revolution
[1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:42.040]  is all of our revolution and it's really succeeded
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  because more people now than ever know about liberty
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:46.040]  absolutely
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:48.040]  you know back to your internet censorship
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:50.040]  you know
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:52.040]  not only is the ron paul video
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:54.040]  been completely
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:56.040]  hacked on the youtube
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:58.040]  but on so many different websites
[1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:00.040]  whether it be dig if someone puts it up
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:02.040]  dig pulls it down
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:04.040]  there's so many different websites
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:06.040]  that are censoring it it's just unbelievable
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:08.040]  to have witnessed it
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:10.040]  time after time after time
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.040]  we have myspace officially told us
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:14.040]  that they let us have a myspace account
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:16.040]  but they don't let our bulletins
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:18.040]  go out but about 80% of the time
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:20.040]  they don't go out
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:22.040]  they do go out or people copy our bulletins
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:24.040]  and send them out themselves but
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:26.040]  then people make videos on youtube saying we're lying
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:28.040]  about this
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:30.040]  comcasted myths in canada along with the other big company
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:32.040]  that they're going to restrict the web
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:34.040]  down to just a few thousand sites and don't give you
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:36.040]  a choice and people don't call
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:38.040]  that censorship and then they're talking
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:40.040]  about getting rid of the old free open internet
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:42.040]  with net neutrality
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:44.040]  and then they call us
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:46.040]  conspiracy theorist
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:48.040]  there's so much denial amy
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:50.040]  absolutely
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:52.040]  absolutely and you know what
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:54.040]  when everyone did that march
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:56.040]  in DC there's 20,000 people that march
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:58.040]  and I just think
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:00.040]  I'm really hoping it sent a message
[1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:02.040]  to
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:04.040]  the oppressors that you know we're here
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:06.040]  and that we're not going away and our numbers are just going to keep growing
[1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:08.040]  and we're not going to sit back
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:10.040]  and watch our country
[1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:12.040]  lose our sovereignty, lose our freedom
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:14.040]  lose our liberties without people standing up for it
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:16.040]  and I think that
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:18.040]  is really giving our nation hope
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:20.040]  you know and that's really thank God
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:22.040]  God bless you Paul, seriously
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:24.040]  well amy what I want to do is
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:26.040]  I want to get you up for a full hour to take phone calls
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:30.040]  in the week before
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:32.040]  the event and I do want to try to
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:34.040]  maybe if you've got the time
[1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:36.040]  be a field
[1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:38.040]  reporter for us just once or twice
[1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:40.040]  during the event
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:42.040]  on the first
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:44.040]  and second
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:46.040]  I can't think of a better person
[1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:48.040]  than you
[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:50.040]  if you've got the time to call in via cell phone
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:52.040]  or one of the phones there backstage
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:54.040]  to kind of give us a report
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:56.040]  because I'm not going to be there on the ground
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:58.040]  from you know behind
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:00.040]  the stage and in front of the stage and in all the booths
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:02.040]  and the entire convention area
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:04.040]  there at the target center I would just love
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:06.040]  to have you give us
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:08.040]  a few reports while you're there
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:10.040]  absolutely give my pleasure
[1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:12.040]  amy fire out your websites
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:14.040]  tell folks how they can find out more
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:16.040]  about your music
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:18.040]  I never really finished about the electric thing
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:20.040]  in order to get my music out
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:22.040]  that I spent two years recording
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.040]  I had to re-record it
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:26.040]  so I re-recorded it
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:28.040]  as a duet and the duet is called Scott and Amy
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:30.040]  and
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:32.040]  so I lifted the
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:34.040]  re-recording restriction and I got a chance
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:36.040]  to re-record all that so that they can go to
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:38.040]  scottandamie.com
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:40.040]  to get that album and listen to that
[1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:42.040]  and they can go to
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:44.040]  amyallon.com
[1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:46.040]  and get to see all the
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:48.040]  rest of the music that I've done
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:50.040]  and the hairspray and the revolution
[1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:52.040]  and all of it so
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:54.040]  amyallon.com and scottandamie.com
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:56.040]  they can go to
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:58.040]  and check out my music
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:00.040]  well you've already had great success
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:02.040]  and you're going to have even greater success in the future
[1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:04.040]  and you are
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:06.040]  a total revolutionary
[1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:08.040]  because art
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:10.040]  is one of the greatest powers we have out there
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:12.040]  one of the greatest tools we have
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:14.040]  to awaken people and there's a lot of pressure
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:16.040]  we know on artists to conform
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:18.040]  to the establishment but you're bringing
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:20.040]  absolutely, absolutely
[1:29:20.040 --> 1:29:22.040]  and managers won't

[1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:36.040]  Amy Allen is our guest
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:40.040]  very accomplished musician
[1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:42.040]  got links to her website
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:44.040]  up on infowars.com
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:46.040]  I'm going to get into what's really happening
[1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:48.040]  with the russia slash georgia situation
[1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.040]  and your phone calls
[1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:52.040]  I'm going to go to the callers holding first
[1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:54.040]  before I play these audio clips
[1:33:54.040 --> 1:33:56.040]  as soon as Amy leaves us
[1:33:56.040 --> 1:33:58.040]  she's agreed to pop in a couple times
[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:00.040]  while
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:02.040]  the big rally for the republic is going on
[1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:04.040]  up in Minneapolis Minnesota
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:06.040]  for us here on the show
[1:34:06.040 --> 1:34:08.040]  I am going
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:10.040]  to cover the dnc and all the
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:12.040]  police state fireworks there
[1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:14.040]  and so I will not be in Minnesota
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:16.040]  besides I don't want to
[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:18.040]  become a distraction
[1:34:18.040 --> 1:34:20.040]  when everybody to have their day
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:22.040]  in the sun there with liberty
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:24.040]  and so I will stay right here in the central
[1:34:24.040 --> 1:34:26.040]  of this command center
[1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:28.040]  going back to Amy Allen
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:30.040]  Amy you were finishing up talking about
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:32.040]  how you get punished
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:34.040]  for getting outside the left or right paradigm
[1:34:34.040 --> 1:34:36.040]  in that you get punished some
[1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:38.040]  if you're seen as a conservative
[1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:40.040]  in a liberal controlled media
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:42.040]  which really isn't liberal at all
[1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:44.040]  that's a facade
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:46.040]  but you really get punished if you're outside of that box
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:48.040]  all together though
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:50.040]  that is starting to change
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:52.040]  and more people I know in entertainment
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:54.040]  Hollywood are really rebelling against it
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.040]  themselves
[1:34:56.040 --> 1:34:58.040]  and the system is getting shutters
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:00.040]  the whole Hollywood system itself
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:02.040]  is in crisis and the old mainline media
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:04.040]  is in crisis
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:06.040]  being caught in so many lies and distortions
[1:35:06.040 --> 1:35:08.040]  and spin and their readership and viewership
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:10.040]  plunging so
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:12.040]  there is a revolution
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:14.040]  not just in the content of the media
[1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:16.040]  but in its delivery and in its
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:18.040]  true diversity
[1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:20.040]  and that's why they're moving to try to shut down
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:22.040]  and curtail the web
[1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:24.040]  well I think that
[1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:26.040]  what's really interesting and what nobody
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:28.040]  talks about and I just
[1:35:28.040 --> 1:35:30.040]  continually speak out about it
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:32.040]  but in Hollywood
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:34.040]  in West Hollywood specifically
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:36.040]  in the gay community
[1:35:36.040 --> 1:35:38.040]  there is a big movement for Ron Paul
[1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:40.040]  and you just don't see it
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:42.040]  in any of the media they just say
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:44.040]  that the gay community is for
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:46.040]  Barack Obama, for Hillary Clinton
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:48.040]  but that's just not the case
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:50.040]  there's a huge gay community
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:52.040]  in Hollywood that wants their freedom
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:54.040]  wants their liberties, wants the government
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:56.040]  to stay out of their business and it's not being represented
[1:35:56.040 --> 1:35:58.040]  and the Ron Paul music video
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:00.040]  everyone from the light
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:02.040]  to the camera to the wardrobe
[1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:04.040]  to everything, the entire
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:06.040]  production was all volunteered
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:08.040]  by the gay community
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:10.040]  and they really
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:12.040]  fought hard and they really
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:14.040]  they're the ones that pushed me
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:16.040]  into doing it, I mean they're the ones that got me involved
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:18.040]  and started telling me
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:20.040]  like all this stuff about Ron Paul
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:22.040]  and about you know just got me really aware
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:24.040]  of what was happening and then we saw
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:26.040]  the distortion in the media that he
[1:36:26.040 --> 1:36:28.040]  hates those people which again
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:30.040]  absolutely it was just so frustrating
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:32.040]  even to them they're like that's not true
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:34.040]  it's absolutely not true
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:36.040]  well that's
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:38.040]  just how the media operates they want to divide
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:40.040]  everybody so they can more easily control us
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:42.040]  absolutely
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:44.040]  but I mean your point about making sacrifices
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:46.040]  to do what you're doing
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:48.040]  you're absolutely right but also at the same time
[1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:50.040]  some people in the liberty movement
[1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:52.040]  they
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:54.040]  want to behave like if we do become successful
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:56.040]  or if we are able
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:58.040]  to fund ourselves that somehow is wrong
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:00.040]  that we should be living under a bridge
[1:37:00.040 --> 1:37:02.040]  somewhere and broadcasting over
[1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:04.040]  10 cans with a piece of string
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:06.040]  no we need to become
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:08.040]  the establishment, we need
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:10.040]  to take over the government, we need
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:12.040]  to act like we're winners and behave
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:14.040]  like we're winners because then we can win
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:16.040]  I mean I've had so much success just because
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:18.040]  I know the enemy is not invincible
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:20.040]  I know we can defeat legislation
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:22.040]  at the state and federal level, I know
[1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:24.040]  if we get the people rally we can do it
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:26.040]  and so we've had massive success and some
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:28.040]  people in our own movement say oh Alex Jones
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:30.040]  he's a sellout, he's been able to
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:32.040]  actually get stuff done, no we are not
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:34.040]  powerless
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:36.040]  and that's what's so exciting about you Amy
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:38.040]  well yeah and the fact that you know
[1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:40.040]  I try and tell artists all the time
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:42.040]  you know they can be independent
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:44.040]  they can start their own record companies
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:46.040]  because the more artists
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:48.040]  start their own record companies and
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:50.040]  start their own and be independent
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:52.040]  of the major labels
[1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:54.040]  and we can actually get
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:56.040]  we can have a movement
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:37:58.040]  of people with free thought
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:00.040]  and a free voice to say what they want
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:02.040]  because you just don't have any freedom
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:04.040]  when you're a slave
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:06.040]  Exactly the military says over and over again
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:08.040]  that the biggest battlefield is the mind
[1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:10.040]  and it is, the real revolution is
[1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:12.040]  music is in news and information
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:14.040]  is in art and films
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:16.040]  and that's the revolution that they're most
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:18.040]  scared of, not this one-dimensional
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:20.040]  let's have a physical shootout with the police
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:22.040]  no, let's take over
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:24.040]  the country with our ideas
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:26.040]  and we already have turned that
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:28.040]  corner where congress has a
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:30.040]  9% approval rating, the mainstream
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:32.040]  media has about a 15% approval rating
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:34.040]  and the alternative media has got like a
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:36.040]  65% approval rating, we are
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:38.040]  kicking their butts
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:40.040]  and so we need to press our advantage
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:42.040]  now before it's too late
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:44.040]  I mean you know that
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:46.040]  the republicans, you know how they had their
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:48.040]  little riot
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:50.040]  in the house the other day and it wasn't
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:52.040]  on any of the news stations
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:54.040]  I mean they're standing on chairs
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:56.040]  the republicans are having their own little
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:58.040]  revolution in the house
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:00.040]  and it wasn't anywhere
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:02.040]  nowhere was it
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:04.040]  was it being discussed
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:06.040]  was it being
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:08.040]  talked about, the cameras were shut off
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:10.040]  in fact we were so busy last week
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:12.040]  we hardly mentioned that
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:14.040]  tell folks about it
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:16.040]  well the Nancy Pelosi
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:18.040]  you know basically
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:20.040]  recessed the house instead of leaving
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:22.040]  for a month and the republicans
[1:39:22.040 --> 1:39:24.040]  and they turned off the lights, they turned off the mic
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:26.040]  and the republicans
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:28.040]  turned back on the lights and they turned back on the mic
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:30.040]  they turned the cameras off
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:32.040]  the democrats turned the cameras off
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:34.040]  you know so
[1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:36.040]  there is a whole thing
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:38.040]  and for days you know tourists were
[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:40.040]  walking by and watching the republicans
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:42.040]  just have their own, they called it
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:44.040]  the second Boston Tea Party, I mean they were just
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:46.040]  standing up for energy prices
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:48.040]  you know for the energy crisis
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:50.040]  and they were saying
[1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:52.040]  Nancy Pelosi wanted everyone
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:54.040]  to go on vacation before voting on
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:56.040]  the energy crisis situation
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:58.040]  and so
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:00.040]  what I'm saying is that there was
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:02.040]  kind of like a mini riot by the republicans
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:04.040]  and that should have been covered
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:06.040]  and they should have been given the political support
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:08.040]  they needed but they weren't
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:10.040]  but now it's not a total secret
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:12.040]  because at least we have a growing alternative media
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:14.040]  and that's the difference, we're still the underdog
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:16.040]  but we can double check them
[1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:18.040]  we can
[1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:20.040]  expose
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:22.040]  what they're doing and
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:24.040]  really short circuited and sabotage them
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:26.040]  Amy Allen I really look forward
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:28.040]  to talking to you more in the near future
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.040]  and we'll try our hardest work for Liberty
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:32.040]  Thank you so much, you too
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:34.040]  We're going to get her to report live for us
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:36.040]  on the rally
[1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:38.040]  for the republic coming up in about three weeks
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:40.040]  Okay
[1:40:40.040 --> 1:40:42.040]  I know I have a bunch of calls here
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:44.040]  John, Rod
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:46.040]  Laser, Chris and others
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:48.040]  I'm going to get to all of you then play a bunch of audio clips
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:50.040]  and we have Professor Chasodosky
[1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:52.040]  expert on eastern studies
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:54.040]  on Central Asian
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:56.040]  Eastern European studies
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:40:58.040]  so he's an expert on it
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:00.040]  he'll be joining us to break that down
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:02.040]  just for about 20 minutes in the next hour
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:04.040]  then more open phones
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:06.040]  but I do want to play the
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:08.040]  Georgian Puppet
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:10.040]  dictator and by the way it is a dictatorship
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:12.040]  there in Georgia, they grab you towards
[1:41:12.040 --> 1:41:14.040]  for you, no free press there
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:16.040]  just more lies that it's a free country
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:18.040]  just total bold
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:20.040]  and no Russia is not really free either
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:22.040]  but it's a popular tyranny I would add
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:24.040]  but they do kill reporters
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:26.040]  when they get out of line in Russia too
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:28.040]  it's all the same, very corrupt
[1:41:28.040 --> 1:41:30.040]  but it wasn't Russia that launched a sneak attack on
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:32.040]  US forces
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:34.040]  it was the other way around ladies and gentlemen
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:36.040]  and so I wanted to play
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:40.040]  Mikhail
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:42.040]  Shalakashvili
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:44.040]  Shalakashvili
[1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:46.040]  the Georgian dictator
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:48.040]  shooting his mouth off
[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:50.040]  about a new world order
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:52.040]  about a world order saying this will decide the world order
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:54.040]  this will decide the world order
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:56.040]  they're just begging to his masters
[1:41:56.040 --> 1:41:58.040]  and of course two weeks ago Barack Obama called
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:00.040]  for a new world order
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:02.040]  and we've got Gordon Brown calling for it
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:04.040]  British Prime Minister and all these presidents
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:06.040]  and the uppies will just laugh and say
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:08.040]  put a tinfoil hat on baby
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:22.040]  the conflict underway in Georgia over its pro-Russian breakaway region of South Ossetia is ringing alarm bells the world over
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:24.040]  analysts say it risks major consequences
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:28.040]  for a region that's become a test of the post-Cold War balance of power
[1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:30.040]  Georgia is the west's main ally in the Caucasus
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:32.040]  when he led a revolution in 2003
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:34.040]  Mikhail Sakashvili
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:36.040]  American educated English speaking
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:38.040]  a fresh reform minded leader
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:40.040]  one who's made NATO membership
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:42.040]  his priority as president
[1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:44.040]  Sakashvili's surprise move
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:46.040]  to retake South Ossetia from Russian backed separatists
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:48.040]  is a gamble seen as relying
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:50.040]  on continuing western support
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:52.040]  but that could backfire
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:54.040]  support could melt away at the attempt
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:56.040]  to reintegrate separatist South Ossetia
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:58.040]  comes to be seen as
[1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:00.040]  reckless provocation of Russia
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:02.040]  determined as it is
[1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:04.040]  to prevent NATO's expansion
[1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:06.040]  and southern flanks
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:08.040]  this carnation is right now
[1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:10.040]  fighting for its survival
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:12.040]  but we are also fighting for world peace
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:14.040]  and we are also fighting for future world order
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:16.040]  what is at stake here
[1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:18.040]  is world order
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:20.040]  and what is at stake here
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:22.040]  are basic principles of international law
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:24.040]  the violence is endangering regional peace
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:26.040]  civilian lives have been lost
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:28.040]  and others are endangered
[1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:32.040]  this situation
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:34.040]  can be resolved peacefully
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:38.040]  we've been in contact with leaders in both
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:40.040]  Georgia and Russia
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:42.040]  turn that drug addict
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:44.040]  off
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:46.040]  good god I can't listen to anymore
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:50.040]  folks
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:54.040]  notice how they always vaguely
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:56.040]  civilians have died
[1:43:56.040 --> 1:43:58.040]  and I've got these reports of the BBC headline
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:00.040]  thousands of civilians
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:02.040]  have died in Georgia
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:04.040]  after Russian attack
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:06.040]  and then you read the article and it says
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:08.040]  you know SETI
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:10.040]  killed by the Georgians
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:12.040]  but it doesn't matter
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:14.040]  that's why the first day
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:16.040]  they were reporting on the news that Russia had
[1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:18.040]  attacked Georgia
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:20.040]  everybody got it set in their mind
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:22.040]  that that is what it actually happened
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:24.040]  and then now it's set in the back of your mind
[1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:26.040]  oh they're the bad guys
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:28.040]  it's so incredible
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:30.040]  when you look at the Olympics
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:32.040]  targeting civilians in Russian military bases
[1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:34.040]  and police stations
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:38.040]  and Bush is running around
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:40.040]  McCain's running around
[1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:42.040]  Obama's running around
[1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:44.040]  all saying it's a horrible provocation by Russia
[1:44:44.040 --> 1:44:46.040]  this is the equivalent of
[1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:48.040]  if I walk up to you with a hammer
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:52.040]  and I claw you in the face with it a couple times
[1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:54.040]  and then you fight back
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:56.040]  and there being news cameras on it
[1:44:56.040 --> 1:44:58.040]  the news reports that
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:00.040]  the person fighting back
[1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:02.040]  against the hammer
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:04.040]  is the person engaging in the assault
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:06.040]  as they treat the public
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:08.040]  like complete and total
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:10.040]  low grade morons
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:16.040]  alright let's go ahead and take calls here
[1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:18.040]  let's talk to
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:20.040]  Rod in Oregon
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:22.040]  Rod you're on the air
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:24.040]  hey Alex
[1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:26.040]  God help us all like you say
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:28.040]  man I've come to the conclusion
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:30.040]  the American people
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:32.040]  all of us are so been so
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:34.040]  apathetic and ignorant
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:36.040]  and dumbed down
[1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:38.040]  the other day on TV
[1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:40.040]  I don't watch TV very seldom
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:42.040]  but it came on real quick
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:44.040]  that program
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:46.040]  Deceived the nation I think it is
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:48.040]  with Bob Schaefer
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:50.040]  who they had on his program
[1:45:50.040 --> 1:45:52.040]  was Carl Rowe
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:54.040]  who was the head of the
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:56.040]  media with this guy
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:58.040]  when all this stuff is going on in Russia
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:00.040]  and obviously we know the main
[1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:02.040]  headline has been this ordeal
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:04.040]  with Edwards
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:06.040]  and his big affair and stuff
[1:46:06.040 --> 1:46:08.040]  it is absolutely like you say
[1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:10.040]  unbelievable and incredible
[1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:12.040]  the stuff
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:14.040]  that is going on in American people
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:16.040]  still run around
[1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:18.040]  just going like oh yeah
[1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:20.040]  okay and business as usual
[1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:22.040]  Fox News called me last week
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:24.040]  and said we want you back on Haraldo
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:26.040]  now remember about a year and a half ago
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:28.040]  I refused to fly to Fox News
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:30.040]  because I've been in the car
[1:46:30.040 --> 1:46:32.040]  repeatedly going
[1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:34.040]  to a studio to be interviewed by Fox News
[1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:36.040]  probably 10 times now
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:38.040]  last night had to be the 10th or 11th time
[1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:40.040]  I'm at the studio
[1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:42.040]  in the chair
[1:46:42.040 --> 1:46:44.040]  Haraldo Herrera has already announced he's going to me
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:46.040]  and then they just decide to not go to me
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:48.040]  and cover some woman who's missing
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:50.040]  from the tropical island
[1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:52.040]  some new one
[1:46:52.040 --> 1:46:54.040]  and I didn't particularly care
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:56.040]  in fact I didn't even want to particularly go on there
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:46:58.040]  even though all this evidence has now come out
[1:46:58.040 --> 1:47:00.040]  where she did tell her lawyer they're going to kill me
[1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:02.040]  if they say it's suicide it isn't
[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:04.040]  I want all the documents out
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:06.040]  but then her mother's lawyer is saying they don't want the documents
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:08.040]  released in the photos
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:10.040]  with her client list and the rest of it
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:12.040]  but I was going to go on there and talk about that
[1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:14.040]  I mean that at least is more important than
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:16.040]  John Edwards isn't murdering women
[1:47:16.040 --> 1:47:18.040]  and I'm not a Democrat folks are listening
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:20.040]  for the first time going oh he likes the Democrats
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:22.040]  he's defending John Edwards no
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:24.040]  I mean you have Brandy Britton one of her girls
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:28.040]  the DC madam who gets busted
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:30.040]  at her $500,000 house
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:32.040]  she shoots her mouth up and says
[1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:34.040]  I've seen some of the most powerful men in America
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:36.040]  how dare the local police charge me
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:38.040]  I'm going to talk to the press and I'm going to trial
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:40.040]  then she hangs herself
[1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:42.040]  she was facing a maximum of six months in jail
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:44.040]  okay she says I'm going to fight this in court
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:46.040]  boom that night hangs herself
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:48.040]  okay then they suddenly go after her boss
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:50.040]  who's on the west coast
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:52.040]  Brandy Britton of course was in Maryland
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:54.040]  they go after her
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:47:56.040]  grab her
[1:47:56.040 --> 1:47:58.040]  she never released her client list
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:00.040]  just put out some phone numbers
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:02.040]  she tells Wayne Madsen and others at dinner
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:04.040]  that yeah some of my girls were seeing Dick Cheney
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:06.040]  and then suddenly she's dead
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:10.040]  it's just unbelievable
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:12.040]  but no they had to do two segments
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:14.040]  with that Corbin guy
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:16.040]  it was an obviously a dead pit bull
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:18.040]  had washed up
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:20.040]  on the side of the New York
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:22.040]  New Jersey seashore
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:24.040]  and they were saying it was a sea monster
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:26.040]  or something
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:28.040]  I mean this country is just
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:30.040]  look I don't even care it's almost a diversion with this war going on
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:32.040]  and two naval flotellas
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:34.040]  headed into the gulf
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:36.040]  two more aircraft carriers
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:38.040]  saber rattling to attack Iran
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:40.040]  it's almost a diversion to even talk about them killing
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:42.040]  the DC madam
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:44.040]  though it just shows incredible corruption
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:46.040]  but to then focus on John Edwards
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:48.040]  and what hotel room he was in
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:50.040]  with a baby
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:52.040]  I mean it's just it's but hey you know what
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:54.040]  it's what they want it's what they get
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:56.040]  hey I got one more thing to add real quick
[1:48:56.040 --> 1:48:58.040]  you had read Beckman on your show
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:00.040]  last week and I ended up getting his book
[1:49:00.040 --> 1:49:02.040]  walls of our minds
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:04.040]  I'm telling ya everybody needs
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:06.040]  to read his book man
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:08.040]  you talk about getting a grip of power
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:10.040]  there were things in there that I didn't even realize
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:12.040]  before that were even to walk me up
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:14.040]  and I'm so disconnected from the system already
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:16.040]  it's unbelievable but
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:18.040]  one quick thing a little boy asked his dad
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:20.040]  what the difference between ignorance and apathy
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:22.040]  was and his dad said I don't know
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:24.040]  and I don't care
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:26.040]  I hear ya I hear ya
[1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:28.040]  and we're gonna get hurt real bad just
[1:49:28.040 --> 1:49:30.040]  but it's not just apathy a lot of these people
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:32.040]  will giggle
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:34.040]  and snicker and get like this little demonic pig face
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.040]  they'll just look at you

[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:46.040]  and they get this weird look in their eyes
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:48.040]  and like pull back from you and look at you
[1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:50.040]  real strangely

[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:14.040]  do you think that there would be any way of pressing
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:16.040]  Seymour Hirsch to find out about the other 11
[1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:18.040]  provocations Cheney was interested in starting
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:20.040]  a war I've already asked him about
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:22.040]  that and he says he's not gonna
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:24.040]  come on until the early fall he's
[1:50:24.040 --> 1:50:26.040]  agreed to come on the show and I will ask him
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:28.040]  about that at the time okay and my
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:30.040]  second one would be how long until that
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:32.040]  US Armada estimate would be
[1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:34.040]  until they may be arriving in the Gulf
[1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:36.040]  I gotta pull that up but I think it's a few weeks
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:38.040]  okay

[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:18.040]  for thousands of years

[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:02.040]  why should we fire congress?
[1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:04.040]  because they use the constitution of the united states
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:06.040]  as a scrap of paper
[1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:08.040]  they swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it

[1:53:28.040 --> 1:53:30.040]  the president's illegal spy program

[1:53:36.040 --> 1:53:38.040]  of terror related spy bills how they affect
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:40.040]  you and what you can do about it
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:42.040]  Washington you're fired captures the spirit

[1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:10.040]  very simply put the united states
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:12.040]  Israel
[1:54:12.040 --> 1:54:14.040]  the ukraine and nato
[1:54:14.040 --> 1:54:16.040]  launched a sneak attack last thursday night
[1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:22.040]  using
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:28.040]  the olympics as they cover
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:32.040]  they've killed more than 5,000 innocent civilians
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:36.040]  swattered entire police stations full of police
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:38.040]  blew the daylights out of the military bases
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:42.040]  the russians are fighting back
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:44.040]  they've pushed them out of that region
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:46.040]  of georgia and are now moving towards their main
[1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:48.040]  military bases to remove the threat
[1:54:50.040 --> 1:54:52.040]  to remove the threat
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:54.040]  you know what did we do in the united states
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:54:56.040]  when mexico
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:58.040]  attacked oklahoma
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:00.040]  and snuck attack a military base
[1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:02.040]  there we went all the way
[1:55:02.040 --> 1:55:04.040]  to mexico city and remove the government
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:06.040]  and then left
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:08.040]  this is what you do
[1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:10.040]  this is what you do when somebody bordering you
[1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:12.040]  sneak attacks you and blows an entire city
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:14.040]  into rubble
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:20.040]  our country is in the wrong
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:22.040]  and israel it turns out
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:24.040]  took me a few days to learn all this
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:26.040]  i knew the u.s. and nato were using it as a front
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:28.040]  a bunch of israeli newspapers are bragging
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:30.040]  that their defense head
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:32.040]  their defense minister in georgia is an israeli
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:34.040]  former messaid
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:36.040]  their foreign minister is an israeli military
[1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:38.040]  chief former messaid
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:40.040]  and i'm reading here out of israeli newspapers
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:42.040]  basically
[1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:44.040]  georgia is some type of
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:46.040]  weird
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:48.040]  satellite of israel more than it is
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:50.040]  in even nato or the u.s.
[1:55:50.040 --> 1:55:52.040]  this because they were there
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:54.040]  it turns out ten years ago and then brought
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:56.040]  the u.s. in
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:58.040]  in the last seven years this crazy behavior
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:56:00.040]  by israel
[1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:02.040]  oh god but i guess israel
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:04.040]  was a big part of
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:06.040]  i mean folks that set up israel
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:08.040]  a big part of setting up russia in 1917
[1:56:08.040 --> 1:56:10.040]  till Stalin took it away from him
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:12.040]  oh man this is so bad
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:14.040]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:16.040]  i mean i guess israel is trying to
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:18.040]  retake russia or something for the zionist
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:20.040]  i mean i have to say that
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:22.040]  that is what this appears to be
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:24.040]  i just call it like it is here ladies and gentlemen
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:26.040]  i
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:28.040]  should have sent a hit team after me now but
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:30.040]  whatever
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:32.040]  i mean is there no end to the
[1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:34.040]  hootspa of israel
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:36.040]  packing russia
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:38.040]  i mean is there no end to this
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:40.040]  what is your problem
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:42.040]  and america's
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:44.040]  name is hung on this but don't
[1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:46.040]  don't think for a minute britain isn't involved
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:48.040]  they're supporting it they own the pipeline
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:50.040]  and as usual
[1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:52.040]  who created israel britain
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:54.040]  who supports israel britain
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:56.040]  who sits back there using the u.s. using israel
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:56:58.040]  using nato
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:00.040]  england
[1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:02.040]  and no i'm not blaming the british people
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:04.040]  i'm going to blow up i get those all the time
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:06.040]  again if i talk about
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  lbj staging an attack
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:10.040]  in the gulf of tonkin
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:12.040]  on our ships i'm not bashing americans
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:14.040]  or texans
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:16.040]  it's just that israel
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:18.040]  the united states england nato
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:20.040]  are evil
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:22.040]  the governments are evil
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:24.040]  and yes i'm sure
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:26.040]  that akmed denigid
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:28.040]  is not a nice guy and i'm sure putin is a bad guy too
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:30.040]  but they don't have anything
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:32.040]  last time i checked
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:34.040]  putin is trying to sell
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:36.040]  oil and gas to people in building factories
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:38.040]  and he's got national tv
[1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:40.040]  ads
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:42.040]  saying that russians need to breed
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:44.040]  and have more children
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:46.040]  and the government doesn't
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:48.040]  say vaccinate children
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:50.040]  and they've been speaking out against
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:52.040]  the new world order
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:54.040]  and saying they want to have their own new world order
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:56.040]  now i'm not saying russia's good
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:57:58.040]  but i'm telling you this folks they are not
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:00.040]  a big boy new world order
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:02.040]  power corrupts absolute power
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:04.040]  corrupts absolutely there is no
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:06.040]  doubt about that
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:08.040]  in history so any government
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:10.040]  tends to be corrupt and bad
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:12.040]  but this
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:14.040]  that's happening now with iraq
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:16.040]  and afghanistan and the attack on syria
[1:58:16.040 --> 1:58:18.040]  all of this is about
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:20.040]  encircling russia and russia
[1:58:20.040 --> 1:58:22.040]  is sick of it i mean you don't think russia
[1:58:22.040 --> 1:58:24.040]  reads the peanut documents or dick chaney
[1:58:24.040 --> 1:58:26.040]  says they want to attack russia
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:28.040]  russia knows that the u.s. gave nukes
[1:58:28.040 --> 1:58:30.040]  to pakistan to menace
[1:58:30.040 --> 1:58:32.040]  india and russia
[1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:34.040]  i mean the criminals
[1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:36.040]  and our government are handing out nukes
[1:58:36.040 --> 1:58:38.040]  and sneak attacking russians

[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:10.040]  the cfo
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:12.040]  the day that we stop asking questions
[1:59:12.040 --> 1:59:14.040]  is the day that we have allowed
[1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:16.040]  the seeds of despotism to grow
[1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:18.040]  at our own door
[1:59:18.040 --> 1:59:20.040]  seven years after the attacks of september 11

[2:22:01.040 --> 2:22:03.040]  as many people know
[2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:05.040]  ever since president Nixon took us off the gold standard
[2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:07.040]  the US dollar has been evaluating
[2:22:07.040 --> 2:22:09.040]  what people don't know however
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:11.040]  is how this directly affects your personal finances
[2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:14.040]  is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:16.040]  the answer to all of this is gold and silver
[2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:19.040]  they have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years
[2:22:19.040 --> 2:22:22.040]  if you had had $100,000 in cash
[2:22:22.040 --> 2:22:25.040]  and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913
[2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:27.040]  and kept them both until now
[2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:31.040]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800
[2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:34.040]  but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000
[2:22:34.040 --> 2:22:37.040]  the answer to protecting your assets is simple

[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:07.040]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to grounds here on
[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:09.040]  and we knew what to do
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:11.040]  or at least we thought we did
[2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:13.040]  truth rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:23:13.040 --> 2:23:17.040]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:23.040]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement
[2:23:23.040 --> 2:23:26.040]  that the air was safe to breathe
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:29.040]  this film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:33.040]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:36.040]  he had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:39.040]  he takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1
[2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:42.040]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:21.040]  yeah, he's taking in fight and he says he'll never give it up
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:26.040]  one life and I'm gonna live it up
[2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:28.040]  yeah, like Napoleon and Hitler
[2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:31.040]  I'm taking in fight and I said I'll never give it up
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:34.040]  yeah, we'll send in Israelis and Ukrainians and Marines
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:36.040]  to blow the hell out of Russians
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:43.040]  and we'll tell our idiot public they attacked us and they'll believe it
[2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:45.040]  I won't talk for this long
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:49.040]  well, if you think we're gonna sit around and let them destroy our country
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:53.040]  we've got another thing coming
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:56.040]  final segment with Professor Michelle Chossidowski
[2:24:56.040 --> 2:25:00.040]  I'm gonna get him back up in the near future for a full hour
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:02.040]  very busy with all of his work
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:05.040]  he's got about 4 minutes left sir, break down how you think things
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:09.040]  at least historically will probably unfold with Russia's past activities
[2:25:09.040 --> 2:25:12.040]  will they take more of Georgia as a security zone
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:15.040]  that's what I would do, it's theirs in the past anyways
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:18.040]  historically, it's not like Poland or something that was never theirs
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:22.040]  and then where do you see things extrapolating out
[2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:27.040]  with the election either way, bearing on if they'll attack or not
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:32.040]  well, things are happening at this very moment
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:37.040]  as we documented at globalresearch.ca
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:43.040]  I think we must understand that Georgia is a NATO-US outpost
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:52.040]  in 1999, Georgia became part of a military alliance with NATO
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:58.040]  it also had extensive bilateral military cooperation
[2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:02.040]  with the United States as well as with Israel
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:05.040]  and there's been a build-up
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:11.040]  and in fact, I think that Georgia's role has been very clear from the outset
[2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:13.040]  it's to confront the Russians
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:18.040]  not necessarily to confront them in any meaningful way militarily
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:23.040]  but it's an act of provocation
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:32.040]  and essentially it serves to create instability in that entire region
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:37.040]  Georgia has borders with Azerbaijan
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:44.040]  it's very important from the point of view of the oil industry
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:50.040]  in the region because Georgia is the transit country
[2:26:50.040 --> 2:26:56.040]  for what is called the BTC pipeline
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:59.040]  it sounds like a bacon sandwich
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:05.040]  but it stands for the Baku Tbilisi Seyan pipeline
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:08.040]  which brings the oil to the Mediterranean
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:10.040]  so all this is very important
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:17.040]  and what the United States wants to do is to break Russia's role in that region
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:23.040]  destabilize and ultimately also, as I said, distract Russia
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:29.040]  from supporting Iran in an upcoming
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:36.040]  either in terms of an embargo on trade in the Persian Gulf
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:40.040]  or a military attack which has been in the pipeline for several years now
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:42.040]  Professor, let me throw in one more question here
[2:27:42.040 --> 2:27:45.040]  I noticed starting on Friday throughout the weekend
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:48.040]  there was also a concerted effort by British financial assets
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:51.040]  New York financial assets and European Union assets
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:54.040]  to put pressure and drive down Russian markets as well
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:57.040]  so we see an economic attack as well
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:03.040]  that's true, Russian financial institutions first of all are very fragile
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:10.040]  because they are integrated by western financial institutions
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:17.040]  but on the other hand, Russia as well as China hold large amounts of U.S. denominated debt
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:19.040]  that was my next point, could they start dumping it?
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:21.040]  almost certainly could
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.040]  and we just posted a very interesting article by Mike Whitney
[2:28:26.040 --> 2:28:34.040]  which says, watch it, because Vladimir Putin could start dumping the Fannie Mae
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:38.040]  and Freddie and Fannie Mae
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:42.040]  Professor, is this not, in historical perspectives
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:45.040]  and I'm somewhat of a history buff because it's so interesting
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:49.040]  but from your perspective, your educated perspective
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:51.040]  is this in the scale of military affairs
[2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:55.040]  not an extremely reckless move and escalation we're seeing?
[2:28:55.040 --> 2:29:01.040]  I think it is reckless on the part of the neocons
[2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:08.040]  because they are overstretched and any military analyst will confirm that
[2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:16.040]  it's not comparable to any other period in, let's say, in recent history
[2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:20.040]  the United States is overstretched in Iraq
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:23.040]  it's overstretched in Afghanistan
[2:29:23.040 --> 2:29:28.040]  and it's facing a major financial meltdown
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:33.040]  and in other words, you're waging, you're entering into a World War III scenario
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:37.040]  with extreme weaknesses
[2:29:37.040 --> 2:29:41.040]  and I fear, again, that under those circumstances
[2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:44.040]  they may in fact resort to nuclear weapons
[2:29:44.040 --> 2:29:47.040]  which is a time and again that they could use them against Iraq
[2:29:47.040 --> 2:29:49.040]  Yes, the neocons may use nukes
[2:29:49.040 --> 2:29:51.040]  I don't want to say bye to you, here we go
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:55.040]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run

[2:32:52.040 --> 2:32:55.040]  we're in a no holds bar information war
[2:32:55.040 --> 2:32:56.040]  Truth is our weapon
[2:32:56.040 --> 2:32:58.040]  and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need
[2:32:58.040 --> 2:33:01.040]  to take the fight back to Big Brother
[2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:10.040]  The Neocons did a bad, bad thing
[2:33:10.040 --> 2:33:12.040]  but they know they have a zombie pub
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:14.040]  but they don't believe anything
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:16.040]  so why not?
[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:22.040]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:26.040]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing
[2:33:26.040 --> 2:33:29.040]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing
[2:33:29.040 --> 2:33:32.040]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:34.040]  You ever loved someone so much
[2:33:34.040 --> 2:33:36.040]  you thought your little heart was gonna break in
[2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:39.040]  Oh, you love your Neocon masters
[2:33:39.040 --> 2:33:41.040]  You ever tried with all your heart
[2:33:41.040 --> 2:33:44.040]  and soul to get your lover back to you
[2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:46.040]  Oh, you love your Neocon masters
[2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:48.040]  You ever tried with all your heart
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:52.040]  and soul just to walk away
[2:33:52.040 --> 2:33:55.040]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:33:58.040]  Walter, Tom, Joe, Travis, Maria in Deutschland
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:00.040]  we're gonna go to her first
[2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:04.040]  we're gonna go into your calls here in just a few minutes
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:06.040]  Lindsay Williams who predicted all this
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:08.040]  what, two, three weeks ago on this show
[2:34:08.040 --> 2:34:09.040]  I could pull the clip up
[2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:10.040]  you all remember it
[2:34:10.040 --> 2:34:12.040]  people are freaking out over it
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:14.040]  the US will start some new war
[2:34:14.040 --> 2:34:16.040]  with Russia with their provocations
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:17.040]  in the next few months
[2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:19.040]  the oil prices will start plunging
[2:34:19.040 --> 2:34:21.040]  but after they're done plunging them
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:23.040]  then they're gonna jack them right back up again
[2:34:23.040 --> 2:34:24.040]  now he could be right
[2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:25.040]  or this could be cyclical
[2:34:25.040 --> 2:34:28.040]  because they always jack them up to an all-time high in July
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:31.040]  then lower them down in August into the fall
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:33.040]  and then start raising them back up in the spring
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:34.040]  in the summertime
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:37.040]  so it'll go from $1.50 to $2.00 during the summer
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:38.040]  and then back down to $1.50
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:40.040]  and then it'll go to $2.50 and then back down to $2.00
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:42.040]  then it'll go to $3.00 during the summer
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:43.040]  and then back down to $2.50
[2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:45.040]  then it'll go to $3.50 and then back down to $2.50
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:48.040]  then it'll go to $4.50 and then back down to $3.85
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:49.040]  I don't know
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:53.040]  but I know this
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:55.040]  they're printing money like it's going out of style
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:56.040]  they're devaluing the dollar
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:34:58.040]  and they've done this every few months
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:34:59.040]  they'll jack the dollar back up
[2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:01.040]  but never as far as it's already falling
[2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:02.040]  then it falls even further
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:04.040]  I hope it doesn't keep falling
[2:35:07.040 --> 2:35:09.040]  why is the dollar suddenly going up
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:12.040]  because the world's saying, man, the Americans are crazy
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:15.040]  they may actually end up being on top
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:17.040]  they're willing to sneak attack the Russians
[2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:19.040]  so buy dollars, buy dollars
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:22.040]  we understand it's only gained a couple cents
[2:35:22.040 --> 2:35:24.040]  it's done that many times
[2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:26.040]  but if you look at the long-term graph
[2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:29.040]  a one-year graph, a two-year graph, a five-year graph
[2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:30.040]  it's going straight down
[2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:32.040]  just type of five-year dollar graph
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:34.040]  or type of five-year gold graph
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:37.040]  gold's going straight up, dollars going straight down
[2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:38.040]  so time will tell on this
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:41.040]  but Lindsey Williams' predictions are getting a little too uncanny now
[2:35:44.040 --> 2:35:46.040]  I think he's a moral good guy
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:48.040]  and I know he worked for Atlantic Ridgefield
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:51.040]  I know he put out info that was accurate about Prudhoe Bay
[2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:53.040]  that's been independently verified by Congress
[2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:57.040]  but now he says this former well-company executive
[2:35:57.040 --> 2:35:59.040]  it doesn't leave much to the imagination
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:01.040]  we know what company he worked for
[2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:02.040]  he's listed the man's name before
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:04.040]  but doesn't want it said now
[2:36:04.040 --> 2:36:06.040]  calls him up and says, you and your family
[2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:08.040]  you're basically going to be dead
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:10.040]  we're going to kill you if you don't shut up
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:12.040]  but you can go out and tell people
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:15.040]  that this is our master plan, ha ha ha
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:19.040]  and he got this call when his hour-long speech he was giving
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:21.040]  that we promoted here years ago on DVD
[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:23.040]  he would be a guest on
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:24.040]  made it on YouTube and Google
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:26.040]  number one video for weeks on end
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:28.040]  tens of millions watching it
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:30.040]  the bankers did not like that
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:32.040]  so I don't know man
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:34.040]  it's bizarre what's going on
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:37.040]  these people walking around saying they're bored
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:39.040]  people walking around saying
[2:36:39.040 --> 2:36:41.040]  oh, you know, life's so boring
[2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:43.040]  oh, I just go out and party at night
[2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:45.040]  and go see movies and drink beer
[2:36:45.040 --> 2:36:48.040]  and my life has no meaning, nothing matters
[2:36:48.040 --> 2:36:49.040]  you're decadent folks
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:50.040]  people that have that attitude
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:53.040]  life is incredible, it's beautiful, it's dynamic
[2:36:53.040 --> 2:36:54.040]  it's horrifying
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:56.040]  it's all there, the good, the bad, and the ugly
[2:36:56.040 --> 2:36:59.040]  and we're on the edge of major global crossroads
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:01.040]  that we're at the crossroads now
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:02.040]  as we keep telling you
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:03.040]  we kept telling you they're going to try to start a war
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:05.040]  with Russia, start a deal with Iran
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:08.040]  and they may just do it, boys and girls
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:12.040]  America out there preemptively attacking nations
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:13.040]  and the neocons have said
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:16.040]  yeah, we don't have the military to do this conventionally
[2:37:16.040 --> 2:37:19.040]  but we may use nuclear weapons preemptively
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:21.040]  and now they're menacing Russia
[2:37:21.040 --> 2:37:22.040]  who has nukes
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:24.040]  I mean this is unprecedented
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:25.040]  and I agree with Shostakovich
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:27.040]  that's what I've been saying week after week here
[2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:30.040]  the escalation that we're seeing
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:34.040]  just with Iran makes the Cuban Missile Crisis look tame
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:36.040]  and now this new situation as I said
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:39.040]  Friday dwarfs the Cuban Missile Crisis
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:42.040]  now all Americans were concerned about that
[2:37:42.040 --> 2:37:44.040]  and were watching and listening then
[2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:46.040]  most Americans don't have any idea
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:47.040]  I did samples
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:50.040]  I mean I would ask people at stores, restaurants
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:53.040]  hardware store, radio station
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:55.040]  one guy didn't know what was going on
[2:37:55.040 --> 2:37:57.040]  thought Russia attacked Georgia
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:37:58.040]  another guy in the hallway
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:00.040]  got real smart mouth with me
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:02.040]  because he's an American patriot
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:04.040]  and I'm not
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:08.040]  I mean it's good to just believe the media
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:10.040]  and just
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:13.040]  it's incredible
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:14.040]  it is so amazing
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:16.040]  okay so I said I'd go to your calls
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:18.040]  I do want to let you know that in the next 30 minutes
[2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:21.040]  on infowars.com
[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:23.040]  and prisonplanet.com
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:26.040]  in the next 30 minutes
[2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:29.040]  you will see the new fabled enemies
[2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:32.040]  two minute trailer
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:35.040]  there's going to be another trailer coming out in a week
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:38.040]  about the this trailer is an overview
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:40.040]  there's another trailer coming out about the Israeli connection
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:42.040]  about a week they're still working on that
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:45.040]  there'll be one more trailer that comes out
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:49.040]  the last day of this month
[2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:52.040]  the last day of August and then the film comes out
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:55.040]  September 1st at infowars.com
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:38:57.040]  you can see it at prisonplanet.tv
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:00.040]  and the DVDs
[2:39:00.040 --> 2:39:02.040]  are being manufactured this week
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:05.040]  we will have them in our little hands
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:07.040]  coming up within a week and a half
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:09.040]  and we'll be shipping these out to you
[2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:11.040]  in fact by the end of the week
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:13.040]  Burmese is in there doing a ride up on it
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:16.040]  I mean we're rushing to make all these so fast
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:17.040]  that we haven't even finished
[2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:19.040]  we just got a short blurb on the cover
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:21.040]  but a longer synopsis of the film
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:23.040]  we are rushing we're uploading it to prisonplanet.tv right now
[2:39:23.040 --> 2:39:25.040]  but it won't be available until the first
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:27.040]  but some of my writers Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:30.040]  Steve Watson can write reviews of fabled enemies
[2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:34.040]  and it's up to you to get this film out
[2:39:34.040 --> 2:39:37.040]  Truth Rising is available right now at infowars.com
[2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:39.040]  in-game terror storm
[2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:42.040]  directors cut all available at infowars.com
[2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:44.040]  it is so important to get the word out
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:46.040]  about who released stage 9-11
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:48.040]  because when you realize we got psychos
[2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:50.040]  they won't just blow up a ship
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:52.040]  or kill some Marines and blame it on somebody
[2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:55.040]  they will fly high-jack remote control jets into buildings
[2:39:55.040 --> 2:39:58.040]  I mean these guys are reckless to the max
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:00.040]  they are arrogant they are
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:02.040]  you gotta hand it to them very daring
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:05.040]  I mean it's daring to blow the daylights out of the Russians
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:08.040]  that never happened during the Cold War folks
[2:40:08.040 --> 2:40:11.040]  the old timers who were actually been in combat
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:14.040]  and were real men weren't complete psychopathic demons
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:17.040]  and they would never do a sneak attack
[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:20.040]  on Russian troops and kill them for no reason
[2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:23.040]  I mean it's a whole new ballgame ladies and gentlemen
[2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:26.040]  we are living in a whole new ballgame
[2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:34.040]  and we are dealing with an extremely reckless
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:37.040]  enemy of liberty
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:39.040]  who is, well the neocons have said it
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:41.040]  in hundreds of think tank documents
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:44.040]  in Rand Corporation, PNAC, CFR
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:46.040]  they've all said we got the power
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:49.040]  we got the nukes, we got the space based particle beams
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:52.040]  we've got the bio weapons, the chemical weapons
[2:40:52.040 --> 2:40:55.040]  Bush in the last 7 years has built
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:58.040]  35, 36 level 4 bio weapons labs
[2:40:58.040 --> 2:41:01.040]  they're churning out according to the Baltimore Sun
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:03.040]  thousands of gallons of liquid death
[2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:05.040]  was the term they used for the bio weapons
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:08.040]  I mean they are not playing games
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:11.040]  I mean they're creating chimera species
[2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:14.040]  and letting them out in open air to spread into the biosphere
[2:41:14.040 --> 2:41:17.040]  with all sorts of plants and animals dying all over the US and Canada
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:20.040]  they're creating human animal clone hybrids
[2:41:20.040 --> 2:41:23.040]  they're just nanotechs being released
[2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:27.040]  I mean you know, Hadron heavy colliders
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:30.040]  to cross the streams as they say
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:33.040]  and all the top quantum mechanics physicists say
[2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:35.040]  well it could destroy the earth
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:37.040]  but that's a low probability we're going to do it
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:39.040]  I mean it's just craziness
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:42.040]  it is as if hell's gates were released
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:45.040]  and the hordes of hell were turned loose
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:47.040]  through the United States on the world
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:49.040]  and
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:54.040]  they're just completely psychopathic
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:41:57.040]  and they want to see blood and destruction and death
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:00.040]  and let's go ahead and play the audio
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:02.040]  exclusive here, you're hearing it here first
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:03.040]  it's going up on the web
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:06.040]  PrisonPlanet.tv members will be able to watch it in high quality
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:08.040]  it'll be up on YouTube in the next 30 minutes
[2:42:08.040 --> 2:42:10.040]  again, here is the fabled enemies
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:12.040]  but it doesn't do justice to it without the video
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:15.040]  but here's the audio to fabled enemies
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:21.040]  the relationship between bin Laden and the CIA
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:23.040]  was essentially
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:25.040]  he was one of the assets
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:27.040]  one of the people they could turn to
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:29.040]  they wanted something done, they wanted bin Laden
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:31.040]  in the early 1980s
[2:42:31.040 --> 2:42:34.040]  bin Laden worked with operatives from US intelligence
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:37.040]  the Pakistani military and Arab states
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:39.040]  is it not true
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:42.040]  that the United States government paid $300 million
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:44.040]  to the bin Laden family
[2:42:44.040 --> 2:42:47.040]  for the construction of the military camps
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:54.040]  at basis though, I really think that these were more CIA assets
[2:42:54.040 --> 2:42:56.040]  people that were recruited like
[2:42:56.040 --> 2:42:59.040]  all of the folks I've been issuing visas to
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:02.040]  then we have that mysterious suitcase
[2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:05.040]  with all of the hijackers' names
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:07.040]  and all of this incriminating evidence
[2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:09.040]  why put a Quran, why put flight manuals
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:11.040]  why put all of this incriminating information
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:13.040]  if it's supposedly going to get burned up
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:22.040]  let's show you some video that was taken
[2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:24.040]  8 days after 9-11
[2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:28.040]  that man there is Osama bin Laden's younger brother Khalil
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:30.040]  and that family that took off
[2:43:30.040 --> 2:43:32.040]  that's a f***ing crime
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:34.040]  I was surprised at the evidence
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:36.040]  that there were foreign governments involved
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:38.040]  most of that information is classified
[2:43:38.040 --> 2:43:40.040]  I think overly classified
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:46.040]  Osama bin Laden
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:47.040]  Osama bin Laden
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:48.040]  Osama bin Laden
[2:43:48.040 --> 2:43:49.040]  Osama bin Laden
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:50.040]  Osama bin Laden
[2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:52.040]  Remember 24 hours ago
[2:43:52.040 --> 2:43:54.040]  it was the Bush tax cut
[2:43:54.040 --> 2:43:55.040]  the Bush budget
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:56.040]  the Bush economy
[2:43:56.040 --> 2:43:58.040]  you don't hear of any of that tonight
[2:43:58.040 --> 2:43:59.040]  it's America's enemy
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:07.040]  America is under attack
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:09.040]  well there you have it ladies and gentlemen
[2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:12.040]  that is the first trailer for fabled enemies
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:13.040]  there will be two more
[2:44:13.040 --> 2:44:15.040]  it will be up on infoawards.com
[2:44:15.040 --> 2:44:17.040]  and prismplanet.com
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:22.040]  here in just the next 30 minutes or so
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:24.040]  we need your help getting this out to everybody
[2:44:24.040 --> 2:44:26.040]  I know I said I was going to have the contest
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:29.040]  announcement today on the 19th
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:31.040]  we're going to announce
[2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:33.040]  probably on the 20th
[2:44:33.040 --> 2:44:35.040]  but before I go to the DNC
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:37.040]  we'll announce on the 20th
[2:44:37.040 --> 2:44:39.040]  but that's the last day for the $5,000 prize
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:40.040]  and some other prizes
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:44.040]  there's a $2,000 prize for internet censorship video
[2:44:44.040 --> 2:44:46.040]  and I can pretty much tell you who won
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:48.040]  I can tell you who got the most views
[2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:50.040]  nobody got close to them
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:53.040]  but I need to go ahead and officially say who the winner is
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:44:54.040]  and announce it
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:44:57.040]  then I need to go through and today
[2:44:57.040 --> 2:44:59.040]  and see who made the best $1,000 prize
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:02.040]  truth rising fan trailer
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:04.040]  and we're trying to get
[2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:06.040]  you have to submit it to our email
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:08.040]  contestedinfoawards.com
[2:45:08.040 --> 2:45:09.040]  it's on the page
[2:45:09.040 --> 2:45:11.040]  a lot of you are like posting it on the site
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:12.040]  on the message board saying
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:14.040]  why aren't I on the contest page
[2:45:14.040 --> 2:45:16.040]  well you got one poor guy
[2:45:16.040 --> 2:45:17.040]  Kurt Nemo doing all the jobs
[2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:19.040]  you got to make sure you email it to him
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:20.040]  so you can get it posted
[2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:22.040]  so tomorrow we'll announce who won the $2,000 prize
[2:45:22.040 --> 2:45:23.040]  and the $1,000 prize
[2:45:23.040 --> 2:45:25.040]  right now let's go to your calls
[2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:27.040]  let's talk to Maria in Deutschland
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:29.040]  you're on the air Maria
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:30.040]  yeah thank you
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:33.040]  I think we're dealing with a neoconstell clown
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:36.040]  I think that genies are the football
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:38.040]  made in the laboratory
[2:45:38.040 --> 2:45:40.040]  part of us
[2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:43.040]  you know like how they do hybrid animal
[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:45.040]  human breed now in the UK
[2:45:45.040 --> 2:45:48.040]  they legalize that now
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:51.040]  yeah, they have human animal creatures
[2:45:51.040 --> 2:45:53.040]  yeah mainstream news
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:55.040]  and we cover BBC, AP Reuters
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:45:56.040]  and people write articles saying
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:45:57.040]  we all wear 10-12 hats
[2:45:57.040 --> 2:45:59.040]  because we don't like turning humans into animals
[2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:01.040]  it doesn't exist
[2:46:01.040 --> 2:46:02.040]  yeah exactly, exactly
[2:46:02.040 --> 2:46:04.040]  and I think the queen
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:07.040]  I think they have had a secret breeding program
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:09.040]  well they do that stuff
[2:46:09.040 --> 2:46:11.040]  and I do think that Bush and Blair
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:12.040]  and the lot of them
[2:46:12.040 --> 2:46:14.040]  are breeding from the queen of England
[2:46:14.040 --> 2:46:16.040]  well there's no doubt about that
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:18.040]  in fact the entire elite
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:20.040]  in England and the US
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:22.040]  are related to the queen
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:24.040]  yeah, exactly
[2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:26.040]  it's like what child was
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:28.040]  children
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:30.040]  by the way, the big genealogy sites
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:31.040]  have done studies
[2:46:31.040 --> 2:46:33.040]  they found basically the same numbers
[2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:35.040]  MSNBC reported on it back before the last election
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:37.040]  in 2004
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:40.040]  that only about 3% of the population
[2:46:40.040 --> 2:46:42.040]  is closely related to the British royalty
[2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:44.040]  in the west
[2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:46.040]  well then why is it that every one of them
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:49.040]  Barack Obama, John McCain, John Kerry, George Bush
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:51.040]  they're all related
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:53.040]  George Bush and John Kerry
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:46:55.040]  George Bush, Jr. and John Kerry
[2:46:55.040 --> 2:46:58.040]  are related on every side of their family
[2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:01.040]  their third cousins, six cousins, nine cousins
[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:02.040]  and people say well how does that work
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:03.040]  because everybody's related to everybody
[2:47:03.040 --> 2:47:06.040]  it's like all Boston Terriers
[2:47:06.040 --> 2:47:07.040]  are related to Boston Terriers
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:09.040]  it is a breed
[2:47:09.040 --> 2:47:11.040]  Colin Powell is royalty
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:14.040]  and he is now a grand knight commander by the way
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:16.040]  which only a bloodline is supposed to be able to have
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:18.040]  that's a commander of the knights
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:20.040]  of the Queen of England, it's disgusting
[2:47:20.040 --> 2:47:22.040]  in fact, hey Aaron
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:24.040]  I am to them
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:26.040]  him saying he's the grand knight commander
[2:47:26.040 --> 2:47:28.040]  yeah
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:30.040]  anything else Maria?
[2:47:30.040 --> 2:47:32.040]  the gene is out of a bottle
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:34.040]  I mean they were created in a laboratory
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:36.040]  but it is not a bloodline
[2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:38.040]  but a test tube, you know how they say
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:40.040]  YouTube, I mean there is just another one
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:42.040]  who knows Maria, I just know
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:44.040]  that we're living in a complete
[2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:46.040]  crazy land, Maria thank you
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:48.040]  now we live in the twilight zone
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:50.040]  Walter in Connecticut, you're on the air
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:52.040]  yeah, hi Alex
[2:47:52.040 --> 2:47:54.040]  yes sir
[2:47:54.040 --> 2:47:56.040]  yeah hi
[2:47:56.040 --> 2:47:58.040]  I'd like to talk to you about some solutions
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:00.040]  to maybe
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:02.040]  help and bring it down this new world order
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:04.040]  and
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:06.040]  I think what you're doing is
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:08.040]  absolutely great
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:10.040]  really damaging them with the
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:12.040]  your radio
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:14.040]  your radio shows and the DVDs
[2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:16.040]  and everything
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:18.040]  I
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:20.040]  do still have some hope that we can take back
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:22.040]  our states and I think that's where
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:24.040]  the battle is going to be
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:26.040]  I agree, instead of getting 60%
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:28.040]  presidential race voting turnout
[2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:30.040]  and 8% on average locally
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:32.040]  we need to get 80% local
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:34.040]  and realize the enemy has seized the presidency
[2:48:36.040 --> 2:48:38.040]  what I've recently done
[2:48:38.040 --> 2:48:40.040]  I've formed these committees of
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:42.040]  safety
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:44.040]  and it's an educational thing with like
[2:48:44.040 --> 2:48:46.040]  DVDs that you're putting out
[2:48:46.040 --> 2:48:48.040]  to educate our neighbors
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:50.040]  and the committees that
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:52.040]  we've set up
[2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:54.040]  will work with our state legislators
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:56.040]  because they're the ones that live right in our
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:58.040]  hometowns
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:00.040]  and the whole thing that
[2:49:00.040 --> 2:49:02.040]  we're focusing in on is
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:04.040]  revitalization of the constitutional
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:06.040]  state militias
[2:49:06.040 --> 2:49:08.040]  we have a lot of history here
[2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:10.040]  250 years
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:12.040]  of colonial
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:14.040]  and state militia acts and it just needs
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:16.040]  some life
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:18.040]  back into it
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:20.040]  the structure of it should be grassroots up
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:22.040]  electing our officers
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:24.040]  from right within our neighborhoods
[2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:26.040]  up instead of top down
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:28.040]  and you've got to
[2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:30.040]  have a code of conduct to shut out
[2:49:30.040 --> 2:49:32.040]  provocateurs
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:34.040]  and at the same time it'd be even
[2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:36.040]  good to get say a mayor to be a militia
[2:49:36.040 --> 2:49:38.040]  commander to make it more
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:40.040]  establishment so the media has trouble
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:42.040]  demonizing it
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:44.040]  exactly
[2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:46.040]  and that's who we want
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:48.040]  part of it are the people
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:50.040]  recognized within our communities
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:52.040]  that are because that's
[2:49:52.040 --> 2:49:54.040]  what it always was
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:56.040]  right from the very colonial days
[2:49:56.040 --> 2:49:58.040]  exactly it wasn't the police
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:00.040]  against the people it was the constable
[2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:02.040]  and the sheriff leading the militias
[2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:04.040]  and what's wrong with having our local
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:06.040]  sheriff have a quote militia
[2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:08.040]  to defend it you know it's basically
[2:50:08.040 --> 2:50:10.040]  civil
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:12.040]  what's the term that they had before
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:14.040]  world war two and
[2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:16.040]  after the
[2:50:16.040 --> 2:50:18.040]  what was the term they had for the public
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:20.040]  in case of attack
[2:50:20.040 --> 2:50:22.040]  or in case of emergency
[2:50:22.040 --> 2:50:24.040]  they had a term
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:26.040]  for that it's driving me crazy
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:28.040]  civil defense
[2:50:28.040 --> 2:50:30.040]  okay well
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:32.040]  the thing is
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:34.040]  is that we're really
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:36.040]  I've worked a lot
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:38.040]  with Dr. Edwin Vieira
[2:50:38.040 --> 2:50:40.040]  really been focusing in on this
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:42.040]  and I wish
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:44.040]  you could have him up some time
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:46.040]  on your air Dr. Edward Vieira
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:48.040]  he's a gold expert
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:50.040]  he's
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:52.040]  most known for
[2:50:52.040 --> 2:50:54.040]  he's a constitutional attorney
[2:50:54.040 --> 2:50:56.040]  I gotta let you go, we'll be right back with more calls
[2:50:56.040 --> 2:51:01.040]  music
[2:51:01.040 --> 2:51:04.040]  may I have everybody's attention please
[2:51:04.040 --> 2:51:06.040]  I've come with a message of information
[2:51:06.040 --> 2:51:08.040]  9-Eleven was an inside job
[2:51:08.040 --> 2:51:10.040]  you like being a puppet sir
[2:51:10.040 --> 2:51:12.040]  you like being a puppet from the new world order
[2:51:12.040 --> 2:51:14.040]  how do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage
[2:51:14.040 --> 2:51:16.040]  was engineered by you
[2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:18.040]  David Rockefeller the Thrallateral Commission
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:20.040]  the CFO
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:22.040]  the day that we stop asking questions
[2:51:22.040 --> 2:51:24.040]  is the day that we have
[2:51:24.040 --> 2:51:26.040]  allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:51:26.040 --> 2:51:28.040]  to grow at our own door
[2:51:28.040 --> 2:51:30.040]  seven years after the attacks of September 11
[2:51:30.040 --> 2:51:32.040]  a global awakening
[2:51:32.040 --> 2:51:34.040]  has taken place
[2:51:34.040 --> 2:51:36.040]  an inside job
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:38.040]  how dare you
[2:51:40.040 --> 2:51:42.040]  if you know that there's treason going on
[2:51:42.040 --> 2:51:44.040]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[2:51:44.040 --> 2:51:46.040]  all hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:48.040]  and if the government has not told the truth
[2:51:48.040 --> 2:51:50.040]  in five years we will be here
[2:51:50.040 --> 2:51:52.040]  on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven
[2:51:52.040 --> 2:51:54.040]  please rise

[2:52:04.040 --> 2:52:06.040]  well I got a question about those shielded
[2:52:06.040 --> 2:52:08.040]  secure sleeves from identity stronghold
[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:10.040]  yeah the sleeves that block us from stealing
[2:52:10.040 --> 2:52:12.040]  account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID
[2:52:12.040 --> 2:52:14.040]  chips what about them
[2:52:14.040 --> 2:52:16.040]  well I mentioned them to our friends and they went
[2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:18.040]  in for purchasing the secure sleeves
[2:52:18.040 --> 2:52:20.040]  oh Bonnie if everyone starts hearing
[2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:22.040]  about the secure sleeve it will destroy our plan
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:24.040]  to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new
[2:52:24.040 --> 2:52:26.040]  RFID reader

[2:52:28.040 --> 2:52:30.040]  they promise not to tell anyone else
[2:52:30.040 --> 2:52:32.040]  I guess you're right that's what friends are for I suppose
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:34.040]  tell them they can get a 5 pack of secure sleeves
[2:52:34.040 --> 2:52:36.040]  that will fit credit cards and drivers licenses

[2:52:38.040 --> 2:52:40.040]  and identity stronghold also has a 3 pack
[2:52:40.040 --> 2:52:42.040]  of secure sleeves for passport books for 1495
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:44.040]  and where do they buy them
[2:52:44.040 --> 2:52:46.040]  they can buy them online
[2:52:46.040 --> 2:52:48.040]  or get a mail in order form at idstronghold.com
[2:52:48.040 --> 2:52:50.040]  idstronghold.com

[2:52:58.040 --> 2:53:00.040]  thanks Clyde
[2:53:00.040 --> 2:53:02.040]  hey everybody
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:04.040]  if you're anything like me I'll bet you like to eat
[2:53:04.040 --> 2:53:06.040]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast
[2:53:06.040 --> 2:53:08.040]  fresh homemade bread
[2:53:08.040 --> 2:53:10.040]  delicious pastas like
[2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:12.040]  lasagna I love beef stroganoff
[2:53:12.040 --> 2:53:14.040]  I love chicken noodle soup
[2:53:14.040 --> 2:53:16.040]  I love desserts
[2:53:16.040 --> 2:53:18.040]  all kinds of entrees
[2:53:18.040 --> 2:53:20.040]  and soups and desserts and breakfast
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:22.040]  I love that stuff
[2:53:22.040 --> 2:53:24.040]  now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices
[2:53:24.040 --> 2:53:26.040]  I mean the gasoline prices have gone insanely high
[2:53:26.040 --> 2:53:28.040]  probably going to go higher
[2:53:28.040 --> 2:53:30.040]  grocery prices are right on their heels
[2:53:30.040 --> 2:53:32.040]  how are people going to be able to afford to eat
[2:53:32.040 --> 2:53:34.040]  well I found a way to buy
[2:53:34.040 --> 2:53:36.040]  really incredible foods like I just described
[2:53:36.040 --> 2:53:38.040]  at half the price of last year's grocery bill
[2:53:38.040 --> 2:53:40.040]  for less than half of what you spent
[2:53:40.040 --> 2:53:42.040]  for the same amount of food last year
[2:53:42.040 --> 2:53:44.040]  I can have it delivered to your door

[2:53:52.040 --> 2:53:56.040]  800-409-5633
[2:53:56.040 --> 2:53:58.040]  800-409-5633
[2:53:58.040 --> 2:54:18.040]  cut those food costs now
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:38.040]  you're on the air worldwide
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:40.040]  thanks for calling
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:42.040]  how are you doing today Alex
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:44.040]  good sir
[2:54:44.040 --> 2:54:46.040]  I'm listening to 24 7365
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:48.040]  up here in Alaska we're sitting on the oil
[2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:50.040]  the nukes and a bunch of Russians right next door
[2:54:50.040 --> 2:54:52.040]  I called
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:54.040]  before about the bar style
[2:54:54.040 --> 2:54:56.040]  my not broken arrow number six
[2:54:56.040 --> 2:54:58.040]  all this stuff seems to be coming into play right now
[2:54:58.040 --> 2:55:00.040]  and
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:02.040]  I'm really not sure where we're going to go
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:04.040]  but
[2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:06.040]  we had
[2:55:06.040 --> 2:55:08.040]  trying to take this back politely through the
[2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:10.040]  process which we're being locked out of
[2:55:10.040 --> 2:55:12.040]  through the voting machines
[2:55:12.040 --> 2:55:14.040]  and
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:16.040]  you are my religion
[2:55:16.040 --> 2:55:18.040]  well don't do that
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:20.040]  because I hold no religion
[2:55:20.040 --> 2:55:22.040]  because God has no religion
[2:55:22.040 --> 2:55:24.040]  and I love Jesus Christ
[2:55:24.040 --> 2:55:26.040]  and I do feel as though
[2:55:26.040 --> 2:55:28.040]  false teachers will be cast into the deep ocean
[2:55:28.040 --> 2:55:30.040]  and that's why
[2:55:30.040 --> 2:55:32.040]  I had a couple other guys call up
[2:55:32.040 --> 2:55:34.040]  and talk about this Kent Hovden
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:36.040]  doctordino.com
[2:55:36.040 --> 2:55:38.040]  and he talks about the age of the earth
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:40.040]  and you're so wise in your way
[2:55:40.040 --> 2:55:42.040]  and every day I rely on your information
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:44.040]  to get by for my family and my people
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:46.040]  and I plan it accordingly because of you
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:48.040]  no fluoridation, no tobacco
[2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:50.040]  no alcohol, dry powder
[2:55:50.040 --> 2:55:52.040]  a lot of food stocked up, well water
[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:54.040]  and you know you start getting
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:56.040]  into all this stuff and you're so knowledgeable but then
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:55:58.040]  you won't even look into
[2:55:58.040 --> 2:56:00.040]  Kent Hovden's age of the earth
[2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:02.040]  which proves that 6,000 years ago
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:04.040]  dinosaurs walked with people
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:06.040]  and the conservation of
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:08.040]  anglomeros
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:10.040]  I think I've actually had
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:12.040]  him on like many years ago
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:14.040]  I don't get into those big debates
[2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:16.040]  because everybody fights with each other
[2:56:16.040 --> 2:56:18.040]  I believe in God, I don't believe
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:20.040]  in this false fight that
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:22.040]  science picked with
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:24.040]  religionist
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:26.040]  and you know what's happening there
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:28.040]  you know I
[2:56:28.040 --> 2:56:30.040]  I'm just here trying to stop World War 3 with Russia
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:32.040]  I don't want to attack Iran
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:34.040]  I'm just a radio talk show host
[2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:36.040]  you see you listen to me every day and
[2:56:36.040 --> 2:56:38.040]  that I'm quote you know everything to you
[2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:40.040]  I try to bring you the best guest
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:42.040]  and try to study what's happening
[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:44.040]  and try to be accurate and do the best job we can
[2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:46.040]  we are flawed
[2:56:46.040 --> 2:56:48.040]  we make mistakes
[2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:50.040]  I don't get into the
[2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:52.040]  partisanship like I've had people demand
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:54.040]  that I come out and bash
[2:56:54.040 --> 2:56:56.040]  and attack Catholics, I'm not Catholic
[2:56:56.040 --> 2:56:58.040]  I'm not bashing Catholics and I've said no I'm not going to do that
[2:56:58.040 --> 2:57:00.040]  but I do have guests on to talk about the Catholic church
[2:57:00.040 --> 2:57:02.040]  pushing for a new world order
[2:57:02.040 --> 2:57:04.040]  that isn't enough for the Catholic basher
[2:57:04.040 --> 2:57:06.040]  I bash
[2:57:06.040 --> 2:57:08.040]  Pat Robertson for calling for all this stuff
[2:57:08.040 --> 2:57:10.040]  and the Protestants get mad at me
[2:57:10.040 --> 2:57:12.040]  I just try to shy away
[2:57:12.040 --> 2:57:14.040]  from all of these religious
[2:57:14.040 --> 2:57:16.040]  infighting and things that are going on
[2:57:16.040 --> 2:57:18.040]  I mean that's what you opened up with
[2:57:18.040 --> 2:57:20.040]  was saying that
[2:57:20.040 --> 2:57:22.040]  that you don't know why I don't quote
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:24.040]  you know get involved in this big debate
[2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:26.040]  about
[2:57:26.040 --> 2:57:28.040]  evolution and the rest of it
[2:57:28.040 --> 2:57:30.040]  I've exposed that the evolutionists came out of
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:32.040]  eugenicists
[2:57:32.040 --> 2:57:34.040]  and believe that humans basically need to be exterminated
[2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:36.040]  the vast majority of us
[2:57:36.040 --> 2:57:38.040]  and that they're very very bad people
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:40.040]  and that they're dehumanizing humanity
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:42.040]  and claiming we're all just basically
[2:57:42.040 --> 2:57:44.040]  mackerel fish
[2:57:44.040 --> 2:57:46.040]  and that old people need to be killed
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:48.040]  and all the rest of this sickening stuff
[2:57:48.040 --> 2:57:50.040]  and I made a film about it called Endgame
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:52.040]  and then I got bashed by all the
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:54.040]  Darwinists because I criticized
[2:57:54.040 --> 2:57:56.040]  him as the father of the modern
[2:57:56.040 --> 2:57:58.040]  eugenicist movement with his cousin
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:00.040]  Galton and I don't even get into
[2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:02.040]  evolution
[2:58:02.040 --> 2:58:04.040]  evolution in the film
[2:58:04.040 --> 2:58:06.040]  I just cover what else they believed
[2:58:06.040 --> 2:58:08.040]  and how social Darwinism
[2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:10.040]  saying the elites have a right
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:12.040]  to kill us and enslave us because might makes right
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:14.040]  the fact that they're in power means that
[2:58:14.040 --> 2:58:16.040]  they're able to do all this
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:18.040]  and then I get bashed by the evolutionists
[2:58:18.040 --> 2:58:20.040]  when I didn't even get into evolution
[2:58:20.040 --> 2:58:22.040]  I said social Darwinism
[2:58:22.040 --> 2:58:24.040]  an offshoot of evolutionary
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:26.040]  evolutionary theory
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:28.040]  which says we're all basically animals and the elite
[2:58:28.040 --> 2:58:30.040]  needs to kill us
[2:58:30.040 --> 2:58:32.040]  so I'm just not going to get off
[2:58:32.040 --> 2:58:34.040]  into these
[2:58:34.040 --> 2:58:36.040]  debates with people I'm just going to keep covering the news
[2:58:36.040 --> 2:58:38.040]  I'm going to do that when we get back
[2:58:38.040 --> 2:59:02.040]  to the news
[2:59:02.040 --> 2:59:12.040]  we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat
[2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:14.040]  in the info war

[2:59:54.040 --> 2:59:56.040]  waging war on corruption
[2:59:56.040 --> 3:00:00.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:00:08.040 --> 3:00:10.040]  social Darwinism
[3:00:10.040 --> 3:00:14.040]  is the most wicked ideology
[3:00:14.040 --> 3:00:16.040]  ever invented by government
[3:00:16.040 --> 3:00:18.040]  and elitist control freaks
[3:00:18.040 --> 3:00:20.040]  elitist had always thought they were god
[3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:22.040]  and always thought they were better than the commoners
[3:00:22.040 --> 3:00:24.040]  and through feudalism they shot to
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:26.040]  starve and enslave
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:28.040]  their populations
[3:00:28.040 --> 3:00:30.040]  as a mode of control
[3:00:30.040 --> 3:00:32.040]  social control
[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:34.040]  and I made a film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[3:00:34.040 --> 3:00:36.040]  where I show you the social Darwinism
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:38.040]  the Planned Parenthood, the eugenics
[3:00:38.040 --> 3:00:40.040]  the poisoning of your food and water
[3:00:40.040 --> 3:00:42.040]  and so I fully
[3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:44.040]  engage them in a frontal assault
[3:00:44.040 --> 3:00:46.040]  something you don't hear all the mainline Christians
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:48.040]  and all the people that don't really teach the gospel
[3:00:48.040 --> 3:00:50.040]  they just argue and fight all day about evolution
[3:00:50.040 --> 3:00:52.040]  I don't argue with how god makes things
[3:00:52.040 --> 3:00:54.040]  or how god produces things
[3:00:54.040 --> 3:00:56.040]  or interpretations of the bible
[3:00:56.040 --> 3:00:58.040]  I love the living god
[3:00:58.040 --> 3:01:00.040]  I am a Christian
[3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:02.040]  I have pastors on
[3:01:02.040 --> 3:01:04.040]  we make no bones about that
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:06.040]  but constantly I get emails saying
[3:01:06.040 --> 3:01:08.040]  you better have this guy on
[3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:10.040]  you better have that guy on
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:12.040]  you need to get into the whole evolution debate
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:14.040]  well I'll decide where and when
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:16.040]  I want to fight an issue
[3:01:16.040 --> 3:01:18.040]  and the social Darwinism that came directly out of Darwinism
[3:01:18.040 --> 3:01:20.040]  about 110 years ago
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:22.040]  when they formed the social Darwinist
[3:01:22.040 --> 3:01:24.040]  idea
[3:01:24.040 --> 3:01:26.040]  out of the just 50 year old Darwinian theory
[3:01:26.040 --> 3:01:28.040]  really about 40 year old Darwinian theory
[3:01:28.040 --> 3:01:30.040]  is abhorrent
[3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:32.040]  and the elites say we are in power
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:34.040]  we are in control
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:36.040]  because genetically we are the best
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:38.040]  we are the elite
[3:01:38.040 --> 3:01:40.040]  and so it's our right to kill and steal
[3:01:40.040 --> 3:01:42.040]  and murder and poison
[3:01:42.040 --> 3:01:44.040]  whoever we want because
[3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:46.040]  we are carrying out evolution
[3:01:46.040 --> 3:01:48.040]  and we are carrying out
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:50.040]  a positive evolution of the elite
[3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:52.040]  over the slaves
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:54.040]  and the slaves don't deserve to breed
[3:01:54.040 --> 3:01:56.040]  they deserve to die
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:01:58.040]  now if that isn't attacking Darwinism
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:00.040]  I don't know what is
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:02.040]  now I'm not debating whether Darwinism itself has any merit
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:04.040]  or whether species selectively change
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:06.040]  or whether you breed two big people together
[3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:08.040]  and you get a bigger child you know breeding
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:10.040]  I believe in that I believe obviously
[3:02:10.040 --> 3:02:12.040]  in a lot of the basics
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:14.040]  but if things just suddenly fish turn into monkeys
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:16.040]  no I don't believe that happens
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:18.040]  I mean the Darwinists have had to admit
[3:02:18.040 --> 3:02:20.040]  they've been wrong about most things they said
[3:02:20.040 --> 3:02:22.040]  and they're having to admit things don't change over millions of years
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:24.040]  a lot of times they change
[3:02:24.040 --> 3:02:26.040]  in a matter of a few thousand years
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:28.040]  so the Darwinists have got a lot of their stuff wrong
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:30.040]  from what the real scientific community says
[3:02:30.040 --> 3:02:32.040]  but I think
[3:02:32.040 --> 3:02:34.040]  Christians and this came out actually
[3:02:34.040 --> 3:02:36.040]  were baited a hundred years ago
[3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:38.040]  by scientists
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:40.040]  who didn't like Christianity
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:42.040]  who wanted to make it look bad
[3:02:42.040 --> 3:02:44.040]  and so it was basically
[3:02:44.040 --> 3:02:46.040]  professors and scientists
[3:02:46.040 --> 3:02:48.040]  that wanted to get some preacher
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:50.040]  who didn't even have a college degree
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:52.040]  into some debate with them to make them look like idiots
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:02:54.040]  now have the Darwinists
[3:02:54.040 --> 3:02:56.040]  created piltdown man and all these
[3:02:56.040 --> 3:02:58.040]  fake creatures and animals
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:00.040]  and primates
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:02.040]  and fake homo sapiens skeletons
[3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:04.040]  are they a pack of lying scum absolutely
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:08.040]  but
[3:03:08.040 --> 3:03:10.040]  I'm not getting into that debate
[3:03:10.040 --> 3:03:12.040]  this is not what my show is about
[3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:14.040]  you can call in about those issues
[3:03:14.040 --> 3:03:16.040]  you can call in and bring it up if you want
[3:03:16.040 --> 3:03:18.040]  but I am not going to be your champion
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:20.040]  I am not going to be a champion again
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:22.040]  for the Seventh Day Adventist
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:24.040]  or a champion for the Protestants
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:26.040]  or a champion for the Catholics
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:28.040]  and all these groups write me and call me
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:30.040]  and say we need you to be a champion
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:32.040]  for
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:34.040]  this Seventh Day Adventist
[3:03:34.040 --> 3:03:36.040]  break-off group or the Jehovah's Witnesses
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:38.040]  or
[3:03:38.040 --> 3:03:40.040]  the modern Baptist
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:42.040]  and I'm not here to do that
[3:03:42.040 --> 3:03:44.040]  I'm not here
[3:03:44.040 --> 3:03:46.040]  I'm here to try to get you to become aware
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:48.040]  of the casual society surveillance grid
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:50.040]  going into place
[3:03:50.040 --> 3:03:52.040]  I am here to try to get you to realize they're poisoning
[3:03:52.040 --> 3:03:54.040]  your food and water by design
[3:03:54.040 --> 3:03:56.040]  and we've caught them thousands of times
[3:03:56.040 --> 3:03:58.040]  that fluoride is eating your brain
[3:03:58.040 --> 3:04:00.040]  and attacking your glands
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:02.040]  that mercury brain damages children
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:04.040]  I am here to point out that the U.S. backed
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:06.040]  Israeli backed forces attacked the Russians last week
[3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:08.040]  a very dangerous escalation
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:10.040]  I'm here to talk about the devaluation of the dollar
[3:04:10.040 --> 3:04:12.040]  to put political pressure on Congress
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:14.040]  to free up oil supplies
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:16.040]  and to strengthen the dollar
[3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:18.040]  I am here trying to fight for the Second Amendment
[3:04:18.040 --> 3:04:20.040]  I'm here trying to defend our borders
[3:04:20.040 --> 3:04:22.040]  and sovereignty
[3:04:22.040 --> 3:04:24.040]  because it's part of the globalist plan to break down our borders
[3:04:26.040 --> 3:04:28.040]  I am attacking whatever their main programs are
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:32.040]  that is what I'm doing
[3:04:32.040 --> 3:04:34.040]  I am attacking their main operations
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:36.040]  I am trying to mobilize the people
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:38.040]  not to follow some particular
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:40.040]  specially cut
[3:04:40.040 --> 3:04:42.040]  ideology
[3:04:42.040 --> 3:04:44.040]  but to just get people to look around them
[3:04:44.040 --> 3:04:46.040]  and think for themselves
[3:04:46.040 --> 3:04:48.040]  that's why we'll have guests on the don't
[3:04:48.040 --> 3:04:50.040]  agree with each other
[3:04:50.040 --> 3:04:52.040]  that's why we have pollers on the don't agree with each other
[3:04:52.040 --> 3:04:54.040]  that's why we're having a college discussion
[3:04:54.040 --> 3:04:56.040]  like a large discussion
[3:04:56.040 --> 3:04:58.040]  here in the Pantheon basically
[3:05:00.040 --> 3:05:02.040]  we'll be right back with Lindsay Williams

[3:08:08.040 --> 3:08:10.040]  led
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:12.040]  by Israeli mercenaries
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:14.040]  the Georgian military is commanded
[3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:16.040]  by an Israeli national

[3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:30.040]  the media is spinning it and saying that Russia
[3:08:30.040 --> 3:08:32.040]  attacked them
[3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:34.040]  they destroyed an entire city killing thousands
[3:08:34.040 --> 3:08:36.040]  continuing to attack with their
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:38.040]  self-propelled rocket batteries
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:40.040]  the Russians have been fighting back
[3:08:40.040 --> 3:08:42.040]  and are now for several days driving
[3:08:42.040 --> 3:08:44.040]  them out of Ossetia and other areas
[3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:46.040]  they've now entered into

[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:50.040]  General

[3:09:02.040 --> 3:09:04.040]  Petraeus says to back up
[3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:06.040]  so our government is delivering troops
[3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:08.040]  to the front line and don't think
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:10.040]  the Russians won't send Heinz in
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:12.040]  they've said anybody supporting the conflict
[3:09:12.040 --> 3:09:14.040]  anybody attacking Russian forces
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:16.040]  or supplying them will be attacked
[3:09:16.040 --> 3:09:18.040]  they've told the international community
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:20.040]  and all the nations that border including Ukraine
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:22.040]  the Black Sea that any ships
[3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:24.040]  trying to deliver weapons they told the Israelis
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:26.040]  this out of Turkey
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:28.040]  they told Turkey anybody trying
[3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:30.040]  to deliver weapons into
[3:09:30.040 --> 3:09:32.040]  Georgia will be attacked

[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:36.040]  Russian battleships and missile cruisers
[3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:38.040]  have been sinking
[3:09:38.040 --> 3:09:40.040]  Georgian ships
[3:09:40.040 --> 3:09:42.040]  this is insane

[3:09:50.040 --> 3:09:52.040]  Paul Joseph Watson prisonplanet.com
[3:09:52.040 --> 3:09:54.040]  an American mercenary has been captured
[3:09:54.040 --> 3:09:56.040]  by Russian forces along with a number
[3:09:56.040 --> 3:09:58.040]  of Georgian soldiers according to a report from the Russian
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:00.040]  news website
[3:10:00.040 --> 3:10:02.040]  and it goes on providing more evidence that
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:04.040]  US and NATO are covertly supporting
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:06.040]  the Georgian army in a proxy war against Russia
[3:10:06.040 --> 3:10:08.040]  according to the report which is a major
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:10.040]  Russian daily the mercenary
[3:10:10.040 --> 3:10:12.040]  is an African-American who is a NATO
[3:10:12.040 --> 3:10:14.040]  instructor and an ordnance specialist
[3:10:14.040 --> 3:10:16.040]  he has now been transferred to the Russian base
[3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:18.040]  of
[3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:20.040]  Vladivostokovs
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:22.040]  it goes on the story also backs up
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:24.040]  previous reports of dead black Americans
[3:10:24.040 --> 3:10:26.040]  being found dead in the capital
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:28.040]  of South Ossetia wearing US uniforms
[3:10:28.040 --> 3:10:30.040]  we played those
[3:10:30.040 --> 3:10:32.040]  Russia today that's the equivalent of CNN
[3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:34.040]  US soldiers recently conducted training programs
[3:10:34.040 --> 3:10:36.040]  where they instructed Georgian soldiers
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:38.040]  how to deal with unexploded ordnances as part of
[3:10:38.040 --> 3:10:40.040]  Georgian train and equip program
[3:10:40.040 --> 3:10:42.040]  and
[3:10:42.040 --> 3:10:44.040]  it is a serious escalation
[3:10:44.040 --> 3:10:46.040]  now he was on with us about
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:48.040]  two and a half weeks ago and he said Russia
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:50.040]  is going to start bringing more oil
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:52.040]  and gas
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:54.040]  to market people have been pointing this out
[3:10:54.040 --> 3:10:56.040]  over the web the interview he said there will be
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:10:58.040]  major confrontations with Russia
[3:10:58.040 --> 3:11:00.040]  in the next year over them trying
[3:11:00.040 --> 3:11:02.040]  to bring this to market BP
[3:11:02.040 --> 3:11:04.040]  owns the end of the pipeline
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:06.040]  which applies more than one percent
[3:11:06.040 --> 3:11:08.040]  which doesn't sound like a lot but that's enough
[3:11:08.040 --> 3:11:10.040]  really shake things up just that one pipeline
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:12.040]  that goes into the black sea and then into Turkey
[3:11:14.040 --> 3:11:16.040]  very very serious but
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:18.040]  Lindsay Williams said you would see gas prices
[3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:20.040]  start plunging he's told
[3:11:20.040 --> 3:11:22.040]  nine weeks ago now he told
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:24.040]  Dr. Stan Monteef this privately
[3:11:24.040 --> 3:11:26.040]  Monteef is an impeccable record so he did tell him
[3:11:26.040 --> 3:11:28.040]  secretly this then a month ago
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:30.040]  Lindsay Williams went public about this and said
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:32.040]  you'll see it start plunging
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:34.040]  because he has a major oil executive
[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:36.040]  contact whose all his previous
[3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:38.040]  information has proven out to be accurate
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:40.040]  but I wanted to get you back on today
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:42.040]  to flush out more of what he said
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:44.040]  in your conversations with him
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:46.040]  more of what your new order
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:48.040]  source said specifically
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:50.040]  about confrontations with Russia
[3:11:52.040 --> 3:11:54.040]  Alex thank you for the privilege of being on with you today
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:56.040]  the standard currency
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:11:58.040]  of the world is crude oil
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:00.040]  everything that you're seeing happen today
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:02.040]  is about crude oil
[3:12:02.040 --> 3:12:04.040]  it's nothing else
[3:12:04.040 --> 3:12:06.040]  they really don't care about people
[3:12:06.040 --> 3:12:08.040]  it wasn't a matter of the fact
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:10.040]  that Saddam Hussein killed so many people in Iraq
[3:12:10.040 --> 3:12:12.040]  after all George Bush
[3:12:12.040 --> 3:12:14.040]  has seen more people murdered over there
[3:12:14.040 --> 3:12:16.040]  and killed than what Saddam
[3:12:16.040 --> 3:12:18.040]  ever did same thing in Georgia
[3:12:18.040 --> 3:12:20.040]  well he was our boy
[3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:22.040]  he was our boy in fact until they set him up
[3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:24.040]  to go into Kalei
[3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:26.040]  sure it's all about crude oil
[3:12:26.040 --> 3:12:28.040]  I ran
[3:12:28.040 --> 3:12:30.040]  I'm so glad that you had Ron Paul on the other day
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:32.040]  congratulations Alex
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:34.040]  and the audience are some of the most privileged people
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:36.040]  on the face of this earth because they get everything
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:38.040]  up to date every day
[3:12:38.040 --> 3:12:40.040]  I don't know how you do such an amazing job
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:42.040]  I was with Ron Paul talking about
[3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:44.040]  what's going to happen and I ran
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:46.040]  every bit of it is about crude oil
[3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:48.040]  I ran Iraq, Georgia, Russia
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:50.040]  every bit of it and 8 weeks ago
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:52.040]  when this individual called me
[3:12:52.040 --> 3:12:54.040]  in order to threaten me
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:12:56.040]  he said you can't talk about certain things anymore
[3:12:56.040 --> 3:12:58.040]  and again this is a big oil exec
[3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:00.040]  you worked for for several years
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:02.040]  but please continue
[3:13:02.040 --> 3:13:04.040]  well I was a chaplain
[3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:06.040]  on the financial aspect of the pipeline
[3:13:06.040 --> 3:13:08.040]  and because I was doing such a job for them
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:10.040]  they gave me executive status
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:12.040]  and invited me to sit in on their board meetings
[3:13:12.040 --> 3:13:14.040]  and an advisory capacity
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:16.040]  in order to help the relationship between management and labor
[3:13:16.040 --> 3:13:18.040]  and because of it I got to know
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:20.040]  a lot of these top people
[3:13:20.040 --> 3:13:22.040]  well I had not seen this man for about 20 years
[3:13:22.040 --> 3:13:24.040]  I talked with him
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:26.040]  and he called me up on the phone to threaten me
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:28.040]  and say you can't talk about certain things anymore
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:30.040]  well after we agreed
[3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:32.040]  and I did everything that he said
[3:13:32.040 --> 3:13:34.040]  including pulling my website and my DVD
[3:13:34.040 --> 3:13:36.040]  and then I decided
[3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:38.040]  I'd be polite and kind to him
[3:13:38.040 --> 3:13:40.040]  and I said how is your family
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:42.040]  where you've been living
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:44.040]  it really became very friendly
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:46.040]  and then I was going to ask him questions
[3:13:46.040 --> 3:13:48.040]  and when I asked him the questions
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:50.040]  he readily answered me just as if he'd been
[3:13:50.040 --> 3:13:52.040]  in the board meetings lately
[3:13:52.040 --> 3:13:54.040]  and that Alex is where I came by my information
[3:13:54.040 --> 3:13:56.040]  people so often think
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:13:58.040]  oh, Lindsay Williams, you're a prophet
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:00.040]  no I'm not, I put all my bridges
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:02.040]  every morning just like you do
[3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:04.040]  it's just the fact that there are certain
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:06.040]  contacts that I still have
[3:14:06.040 --> 3:14:08.040]  amongst the elite
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:10.040]  who tell me things from time to time
[3:14:10.040 --> 3:14:12.040]  and over the past 35 years
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:14.040]  the only thing I've ever done
[3:14:14.040 --> 3:14:16.040]  is just voiced
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:18.040]  what I have heard them tell me
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:20.040]  and when this individual called me 8 weeks ago
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:22.040]  and begun to tell me all of these things
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:24.040]  are going to happen in that year to 2 years
[3:14:24.040 --> 3:14:26.040]  and I've been founded
[3:14:26.040 --> 3:14:28.040]  and that's where all this information came from Alex
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:30.040]  well Lindsay
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:32.040]  let's get into specifics
[3:14:32.040 --> 3:14:34.040]  because everybody was freaking out
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:36.040]  on YouTube comments and on my
[3:14:36.040 --> 3:14:38.040]  infowars.com comments
[3:14:38.040 --> 3:14:40.040]  pages, you can comment below the pages
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:42.040]  people are using it as a message board
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:44.040]  that is people can comment on the stories
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:46.040]  to be specific
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:48.040]  and they're all pointing out
[3:14:48.040 --> 3:14:50.040]  that you had talked about confrontation
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:52.040]  with Russia in and around Central Asia
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:54.040]  when you were on, I don't have a staff at the time
[3:14:54.040 --> 3:14:56.040]  to go back and listen to the 3 or 4 hours
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:14:58.040]  of interviews we did 2 or 3 weeks ago
[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:00.040]  but then I brought that up to you
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:02.040]  and you said well yes I did
[3:15:02.040 --> 3:15:04.040]  he did tell me that there will be escalating
[3:15:04.040 --> 3:15:06.040]  tensions in that region
[3:15:06.040 --> 3:15:08.040]  with the Russians
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:10.040]  did he say anything else about that
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:12.040]  okay let me give you
[3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:14.040]  the context in which that was given to me
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:16.040]  because there again let me stress
[3:15:16.040 --> 3:15:18.040]  I only say what I have been told
[3:15:18.040 --> 3:15:20.040]  by and this person
[3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:22.040]  gave me certain things he said
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:24.040]  the price of crude oil is going
[3:15:24.040 --> 3:15:26.040]  to $50 a barrel eventually
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:28.040]  it will probably go up more before it goes there
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:30.040]  he said we're going to open up
[3:15:30.040 --> 3:15:32.040]  2 major oil fields in the world
[3:15:32.040 --> 3:15:34.040]  in order to flood the world with crude oil
[3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:36.040]  and basically destroy
[3:15:36.040 --> 3:15:38.040]  the economies of the Middle East
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:40.040]  the oil producing countries of the
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:42.040]  Arabs and he said we're going to open up
[3:15:42.040 --> 3:15:44.040]  2 oil fields, I asked him where are they
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:46.040]  he said number 1 in Indonesia
[3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:48.040]  he said another one north of Russia
[3:15:48.040 --> 3:15:50.040]  now on July the 24th
[3:15:50.040 --> 3:15:52.040]  Fox News added headlines
[3:15:52.040 --> 3:15:54.040]  that there is a major oil field
[3:15:54.040 --> 3:15:56.040]  that was found in north of Russia
[3:15:56.040 --> 3:15:58.040]  or northern Russia now
[3:15:58.040 --> 3:16:00.040]  in the context of the fact
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:02.040]  that Russia is going to become
[3:16:02.040 --> 3:16:04.040]  the leading major
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:06.040]  financial power in the world
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:08.040]  you realize right now
[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:10.040]  that there are more millionaires in Russia
[3:16:10.040 --> 3:16:12.040]  than in any other country in the world
[3:16:12.040 --> 3:16:14.040]  and
[3:16:14.040 --> 3:16:16.040]  it's all about oil
[3:16:16.040 --> 3:16:18.040]  in the context of the fact
[3:16:18.040 --> 3:16:20.040]  that he said they're going to have this major oil
[3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:22.040]  field found in Russia
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:24.040]  that Russia is going to supply most of the oil
[3:16:24.040 --> 3:16:26.040]  for the world beginning almost immediately
[3:16:26.040 --> 3:16:28.040]  whenever this oil field is announced
[3:16:28.040 --> 3:16:30.040]  which it was on July the 24th
[3:16:30.040 --> 3:16:32.040]  I knew
[3:16:32.040 --> 3:16:34.040]  that we would have confrontations
[3:16:34.040 --> 3:16:36.040]  with Russia from that point on
[3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:38.040]  then Georgia comes up
[3:16:38.040 --> 3:16:40.040]  and what's it all about
[3:16:40.040 --> 3:16:42.040]  oil pipeline, oil in Georgia
[3:16:42.040 --> 3:16:44.040]  natural gas going through Georgia
[3:16:44.040 --> 3:16:46.040]  Russia has
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:48.040]  interest in Georgia because of oil
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:50.040]  and natural gas
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:52.040]  and every bit of this all revolves
[3:16:52.040 --> 3:16:54.040]  around one thing, oil
[3:16:54.040 --> 3:16:56.040]  so we definitely
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:16:58.040]  I could gather from the context of what this man said
[3:16:58.040 --> 3:17:00.040]  we can expect over the next
[3:17:00.040 --> 3:17:02.040]  few years more and more and more
[3:17:02.040 --> 3:17:04.040]  power to be vested in Russia
[3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:06.040]  now did you extrapolate that or deduce
[3:17:06.040 --> 3:17:08.040]  that or did he specifically say
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:10.040]  we're going to have confrontations with Russia
[3:17:10.040 --> 3:17:12.040]  no, I extrapolated that
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:14.040]  he did not say we're going to have confrontations
[3:17:14.040 --> 3:17:16.040]  with Russia but I knew
[3:17:16.040 --> 3:17:18.040]  that if Russia becomes the financial power
[3:17:18.040 --> 3:17:20.040]  that he said it was going to
[3:17:20.040 --> 3:17:22.040]  and that there is this major oil field
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:24.040]  that will supply the majority of oil
[3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:26.040]  for the world from Russia
[3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:28.040]  I knew that this meant confrontations with Russia
[3:17:28.040 --> 3:17:30.040]  but I didn't expect it to happen this quickly
[3:17:30.040 --> 3:17:32.040]  Lindsay, why don't you call
[3:17:32.040 --> 3:17:34.040]  him back again and
[3:17:34.040 --> 3:17:36.040]  ask him some more questions
[3:17:36.040 --> 3:17:38.040]  I mean have you only talked to him twice?
[3:17:38.040 --> 3:17:40.040]  I talked to him three times
[3:17:40.040 --> 3:17:42.040]  okay well when's the last time you talked to him?
[3:17:44.040 --> 3:17:46.040]  about
[3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:48.040]  three weeks ago
[3:17:48.040 --> 3:17:50.040]  so right around the time you were on my show last
[3:17:50.040 --> 3:17:52.040]  just before I was on your show
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:54.040]  what was the last thing you talked to him about?
[3:17:54.040 --> 3:17:56.040]  I asked him
[3:17:56.040 --> 3:17:58.040]  I said what can I say
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:00.040]  that what you've told me
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:02.040]  you've told me these things are going to happen
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:04.040]  and I said I don't want to get in trouble
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:06.040]  and definitely don't want you to threaten me again
[3:18:06.040 --> 3:18:08.040]  I said can I say
[3:18:08.040 --> 3:18:10.040]  Lindsay Williams thinks these things are going to happen
[3:18:10.040 --> 3:18:12.040]  he says as long as you leave my name out
[3:18:12.040 --> 3:18:14.040]  I'll bet you can
[3:18:14.040 --> 3:18:16.040]  what a nice gangster
[3:18:18.040 --> 3:18:20.040]  well you need to call him back Lindsay
[3:18:20.040 --> 3:18:22.040]  you need to call him back and pick his brain about
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:24.040]  some more things that are happening
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:26.040]  now obviously the discovery of this
[3:18:26.040 --> 3:18:28.040]  Russian oil and their discovering fields everywhere
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:30.040]  I mean that alone shouldn't drive the price down
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:32.040]  because they have to then bring it to market
[3:18:32.040 --> 3:18:34.040]  the imploding dollar is what
[3:18:34.040 --> 3:18:36.040]  has driven oil up in every summer
[3:18:36.040 --> 3:18:38.040]  I mean this could be him being right
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:40.040]  or it could be that every summer
[3:18:40.040 --> 3:18:42.040]  for the last six years it's been going up
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:44.040]  to an all time high then dropping
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:46.040]  during the fall and winter
[3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:48.040]  late summer fall and winter and then going back up
[3:18:48.040 --> 3:18:50.040]  in spring into mid summer and then back down
[3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:52.040]  I mean that's how it works you have a 12 months
[3:18:52.040 --> 3:18:54.040]  in front of you
[3:18:54.040 --> 3:18:56.040]  and in the
[3:18:56.040 --> 3:18:58.040]  first part of the year
[3:18:58.040 --> 3:19:00.040]  it's you know low
[3:19:00.040 --> 3:19:02.040]  and then it goes in the middle part of the year and goes up
[3:19:02.040 --> 3:19:04.040]  and then it goes back down into the end of the year
[3:19:04.040 --> 3:19:06.040]  and then it goes back to the start of the next year
[3:19:06.040 --> 3:19:08.040]  so I'm not saying that this person isn't
[3:19:08.040 --> 3:19:10.040]  a real source I know you've got good sources
[3:19:10.040 --> 3:19:12.040]  and you know we know where you worked

[3:19:16.040 --> 3:19:18.040]  I'm just throwing that out there

[3:21:32.040 --> 3:21:34.040]  I continue to hear stories about

[3:21:36.040 --> 3:21:38.040]  confiscation of stocks and bonds
[3:21:38.040 --> 3:21:40.040]  it makes me wonder if the US citizen
[3:21:40.040 --> 3:21:42.040]  will ever again have the right
[3:21:42.040 --> 3:21:44.040]  to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness

[3:23:24.040 --> 3:23:26.040]  80% of humanity
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:28.040]  is at hand
[3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:38.040]  I'm gonna play a little bit of this
[3:23:38.040 --> 3:23:40.040]  I think it says it all
[3:23:40.040 --> 3:23:42.040]  there's a man going around
[3:23:42.040 --> 3:23:44.040]  taking names
[3:23:44.040 --> 3:23:46.040]  and he decides
[3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:48.040]  who to free and who to blame
[3:23:48.040 --> 3:23:50.040]  everybody
[3:23:50.040 --> 3:23:52.040]  won't be treated
[3:23:52.040 --> 3:23:54.040]  all the same
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:23:56.040]  there'll be a golden letter
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:23:58.040]  reaching down
[3:24:00.040 --> 3:24:02.040]  when the man
[3:24:02.040 --> 3:24:04.040]  comes around
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:08.040]  the hairs
[3:24:08.040 --> 3:24:10.040]  on your arm
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:12.040]  will stand up
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:14.040]  at the terror
[3:24:14.040 --> 3:24:16.040]  in each sip and in each suck
[3:24:16.040 --> 3:24:18.040]  will you partake
[3:24:18.040 --> 3:24:20.040]  of that last offered cup
[3:24:22.040 --> 3:24:24.040]  or disappear
[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:26.040]  into the potter's ground
[3:24:28.040 --> 3:24:30.040]  when the man comes around
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:34.040]  hear the trumpets
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:36.040]  hear the pipers
[3:24:38.040 --> 3:24:40.040]  100 million angels singing
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:44.040]  multitudes are marching
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:46.040]  to the big cattle drum
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:50.040]  voices calling, voices crying
[3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:54.040]  some are born
[3:24:54.040 --> 3:24:56.040]  and some are dying
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:00.040]  it's Alpha and Omega's
[3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:02.040]  kingdom come
[3:25:02.040 --> 3:25:04.040]  and the whirlwind
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:06.040]  is in the thorn tree
[3:25:08.040 --> 3:25:10.040]  the virgins are all
[3:25:10.040 --> 3:25:12.040]  trimming their wigs
[3:25:12.040 --> 3:25:14.040]  the whirlwind
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:16.040]  Lindsay Williams is our guest
[3:25:16.040 --> 3:25:18.040]  we're going to take your calls in the next segment
[3:25:18.040 --> 3:25:20.040]  John, Rusty, Brendan, Cody
[3:25:20.040 --> 3:25:22.040]  folks from Arizona, Australia,
[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:24.040]  Arkansas, New Hampshire, you name it
[3:25:24.040 --> 3:25:26.040]  1-800-25-99-231
[3:25:26.040 --> 3:25:28.040]  in this short segment
[3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:30.040]  any key points that need to be made
[3:25:30.040 --> 3:25:32.040]  Lindsay Williams
[3:25:32.040 --> 3:25:34.040]  in world developments from your inside sources
[3:25:36.040 --> 3:25:38.040]  the elitist play both sides
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:40.040]  and at this point
[3:25:40.040 --> 3:25:42.040]  Russia is going to be probably
[3:25:42.040 --> 3:25:44.040]  the most prominent nation on the face
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:46.040]  of the earth from this point on
[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:48.040]  this man was very emphatic
[3:25:48.040 --> 3:25:50.040]  about the fact that this oil field
[3:25:50.040 --> 3:25:52.040]  combined these two
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:54.040]  Indonesia has not been announced yet
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:25:56.040]  North of Russia was announced
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:25:58.040]  by Fox News headlines on July 24
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:00.040]  these two oil fields
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:02.040]  combined contain more
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:04.040]  recoverable oil than
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:06.040]  all of the Middle East combined
[3:26:06.040 --> 3:26:08.040]  Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Dubai
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:10.040]  everything over there combined
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:12.040]  and these two oil fields as they said
[3:26:12.040 --> 3:26:14.040]  they were going to open up, they're ready to go
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:16.040]  will produce more crude oil
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:18.040]  than all the Middle East combined
[3:26:18.040 --> 3:26:20.040]  that means that Russia is going to be
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:22.040]  a major contender
[3:26:22.040 --> 3:26:24.040]  the United States of America is going to have to take a back seat
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:26.040]  we are not going to be
[3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:28.040]  allowed to produce our crude oil
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:30.040]  from the North slope of Alaska
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:32.040]  that monstrous oil find in Montana
[3:26:32.040 --> 3:26:34.040]  and North Dakota
[3:26:34.040 --> 3:26:36.040]  that we know is there
[3:26:36.040 --> 3:26:38.040]  going to be allowed to be opened up
[3:26:38.040 --> 3:26:40.040]  and as a result, we will have
[3:26:40.040 --> 3:26:42.040]  major, my prediction now
[3:26:42.040 --> 3:26:44.040]  this is Lindsay Williams
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:46.040]  my prediction is we will have major
[3:26:46.040 --> 3:26:48.040]  confrontations with Russia from this point on
[3:26:50.040 --> 3:26:52.040]  alright, very interesting
[3:26:52.040 --> 3:26:54.040]  let's go to Brendan in Australia
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:56.040]  Brendan, you're on the air worldwide
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:26:58.040]  hello?
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:00.040]  yes, Brendan
[3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:02.040]  thanks for having me on, hello Mr. Williams
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:04.040]  hi there Brendan
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:06.040]  I just wanted to comment
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:08.040]  I noticed something interesting on the
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:10.040]  I was watching CNN
[3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:12.040]  and I saw when the conflicts
[3:27:12.040 --> 3:27:14.040]  started, the President, the Georgian
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:16.040]  President went on TV and he was saying
[3:27:16.040 --> 3:27:18.040]  talking about issuing
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:20.040]  a state of war
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:22.040]  and then he said
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:24.040]  actually he said we're not going to
[3:27:24.040 --> 3:27:26.040]  be taking away anybody's
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:28.040]  democratic freedoms, we're not going to be restricting
[3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:30.040]  movement of anyone
[3:27:30.040 --> 3:27:32.040]  but Parliament will just be in 24 hours
[3:27:32.040 --> 3:27:34.040]  and you know, other
[3:27:34.040 --> 3:27:36.040]  things like that
[3:27:36.040 --> 3:27:38.040]  and then after he finished his speech
[3:27:38.040 --> 3:27:40.040]  they had the CNN
[3:27:40.040 --> 3:27:42.040]  correspondent sort of wrap it up
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:44.040]  and he mentioned
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:46.040]  he said the Georgian President
[3:27:46.040 --> 3:27:48.040]  mentioned a state of war which
[3:27:48.040 --> 3:27:50.040]  it gives the President
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:52.040]  special powers to
[3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:54.040]  install rules
[3:27:54.040 --> 3:27:56.040]  without having to go to Government or Parliament
[3:27:56.040 --> 3:27:58.040]  he came on
[3:27:58.040 --> 3:28:00.040]  and lied to the West and then declared
[3:28:00.040 --> 3:28:02.040]  martial law
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:04.040]  and they've got all sorts of police state operations
[3:28:04.040 --> 3:28:06.040]  in Georgia, you know, Russia's
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:08.040]  corrupt but so is Georgia
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:10.040]  and the whole point here is Georgia backed up
[3:28:10.040 --> 3:28:12.040]  by Israeli and US forces and US people
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:14.040]  have now been captured, it's confirmed
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:16.040]  running sneak attacks on the Russians
[3:28:16.040 --> 3:28:18.040]  this is unprecedented
[3:28:18.040 --> 3:28:20.040]  escalation, Lindsey Williams
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:22.040]  yes, it is, and I was amazed
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:24.040]  that this is taking place so quickly
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:26.040]  because seven, I'm sorry
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:28.040]  eight weeks ago now
[3:28:28.040 --> 3:28:30.040]  you said we are going to open up
[3:28:30.040 --> 3:28:32.040]  this major oil field
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:34.040]  now keep in mind something, most
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:28:36.040]  of the elite are socialistic
[3:28:36.040 --> 3:28:38.040]  in their thinking so for them
[3:28:38.040 --> 3:28:40.040]  to promote Russia and open up
[3:28:40.040 --> 3:28:42.040]  this huge oil field and flood the world
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:44.040]  with it is nothing new
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:46.040]  now, this means then that Russia
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:28:48.040]  is going to take advantage of
[3:28:48.040 --> 3:28:50.040]  all of the resources that they've got
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:52.040]  that they know they're going to have in the future
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:54.040]  and now this Georgia situation
[3:28:54.040 --> 3:28:56.040]  produces, oh my goodness Alex
[3:28:56.040 --> 3:28:58.040]  it's just as scary what's happening over there
[3:28:58.040 --> 3:29:02.040]  anything else, Brendon from Australia?
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:04.040]  stay there, Brendon
[3:29:04.040 --> 3:29:06.040]  got a break, satellite
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:08.040]  we'll be back with Brendon in Australia
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:10.040]  John, Rusty, Cody and many others
[3:29:10.040 --> 3:29:12.040]  I'm Alex Jones, the new
[3:29:12.040 --> 3:29:14.040]  trailer is up on infowars.com
[3:29:14.040 --> 3:29:30.040]  right now, fabled enemies
[3:29:30.040 --> 3:29:32.040]  may I have everybody's attention please
[3:29:32.040 --> 3:29:34.040]  I've come with a message of information
[3:29:34.040 --> 3:29:36.040]  9-11 was an inside job
[3:29:36.040 --> 3:29:38.040]  do you like being a puppet sir
[3:29:38.040 --> 3:29:40.040]  do you like being a puppet for the new world order
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:42.040]  how do the American people know
[3:29:42.040 --> 3:29:44.040]  that the state was engineered by you
[3:29:44.040 --> 3:29:46.040]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission
[3:29:46.040 --> 3:29:48.040]  the CAFAR
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:50.040]  the day that we stop asking questions
[3:29:50.040 --> 3:29:52.040]  is the day that we have
[3:29:52.040 --> 3:29:54.040]  allowed the seeds of despotism
[3:29:54.040 --> 3:29:56.040]  to grow at our own door
[3:29:56.040 --> 3:29:58.040]  seven years after the attacks of September 11
[3:29:58.040 --> 3:30:00.040]  a global awakening
[3:30:00.040 --> 3:30:02.040]  has taken place
[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:04.040]  an inside job
[3:30:04.040 --> 3:30:06.040]  how dare you
[3:30:08.040 --> 3:30:10.040]  if you know that there's treason going on
[3:30:10.040 --> 3:30:12.040]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:14.040]  all hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[3:30:14.040 --> 3:30:16.040]  and if the government has not told the truth
[3:30:16.040 --> 3:30:18.040]  in five years we will be here
[3:30:18.040 --> 3:30:20.040]  on the tenth anniversary of...

[3:31:32.040 --> 3:31:34.040]  hangover
[3:31:34.040 --> 3:31:36.040]  I know, as the makers of drink and mate hangover defense

[3:31:38.040 --> 3:31:40.040]  grown respectable adults don't get
[3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:42.040]  hangovers, hangovers
[3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:44.040]  are what you got in college when you had about
[3:31:44.040 --> 3:31:46.040]  10 too many at the frat house and then rolled
[3:31:46.040 --> 3:31:48.040]  out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon
[3:31:48.040 --> 3:31:50.040]  the next day, these days
[3:31:50.040 --> 3:31:52.040]  well sure sometimes you'll have a couple
[3:31:52.040 --> 3:31:54.040]  drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up
[3:31:54.040 --> 3:31:56.040]  with a little headache feeling just a bit
[3:31:56.040 --> 3:31:58.040]  queasy, but that's not really a hangover
[3:31:58.040 --> 3:32:00.040]  is it, well call it what you want
[3:32:00.040 --> 3:32:02.040]  but now you don't need to get one
[3:32:02.040 --> 3:32:04.040]  thanks to drink and mate hangover defense
[3:32:04.040 --> 3:32:06.040]  just pop one fizzy drink and mate
[3:32:06.040 --> 3:32:08.040]  tablet into a glass of water just after
[3:32:08.040 --> 3:32:10.040]  you have a couple drinks, they taste great
[3:32:10.040 --> 3:32:12.040]  and the patented guava leaf extract formula
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:14.040]  works while you sleep

[3:32:16.040 --> 3:32:18.040]  queasiness, no hangover

[3:32:28.040 --> 3:32:40.040]  hangovers
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:42.040]  the fabled enemies trailer
[3:32:42.040 --> 3:32:44.040]  is posted at the top of the page
[3:32:44.040 --> 3:32:46.040]  at infowars.com
[3:32:46.040 --> 3:32:48.040]  it's not yet up on prisonplanet.com
[3:32:48.040 --> 3:32:50.040]  neocons call
[3:32:50.040 --> 3:32:52.040]  for us to launch war with
[3:32:52.040 --> 3:32:54.040]  Russia is also
[3:32:54.040 --> 3:32:56.040]  posted there today the New York Times
[3:32:56.040 --> 3:32:58.040]  reports that Russia is escalating its war with Georgia
[3:32:58.040 --> 3:33:00.040]  what a deceptive headline
[3:33:00.040 --> 3:33:02.040]  moving tanks and troops to the separatist enclave
[3:33:02.040 --> 3:33:04.040]  of south Ossetia and advancing
[3:33:04.040 --> 3:33:06.040]  towards the city of Gory
[3:33:06.040 --> 3:33:08.040]  in central Georgia and even bombing parts
[3:33:08.040 --> 3:33:10.040]  of Tbilisi's
[3:33:10.040 --> 3:33:12.040]  the Georgian capital
[3:33:12.040 --> 3:33:14.040]  Russia's increasing aggression is putting a spark
[3:33:14.040 --> 3:33:16.040]  into American neoconservatives today
[3:33:16.040 --> 3:33:18.040]  they're always mad the Russians kicked out Trotsky
[3:33:18.040 --> 3:33:20.040]  who was their founder, a bunch of dirty commies
[3:33:20.040 --> 3:33:22.040]  Russia's increasing aggression
[3:33:22.040 --> 3:33:24.040]  is putting a spark into American neoconservatives
[3:33:24.040 --> 3:33:26.040]  that means communist
[3:33:26.040 --> 3:33:28.040]  today on the Times op-ed page
[3:33:28.040 --> 3:33:30.040]  one of their leaders William Crystal founder
[3:33:30.040 --> 3:33:32.040]  of the communist movement 4th International
[3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:34.040]  his father founded it
[3:33:34.040 --> 3:33:36.040]  claims the US must defend Georgia's sovereignty
[3:33:36.040 --> 3:33:38.040]  as a reward for participation in Iraq
[3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:40.040]  while the conservative Washington Times
[3:33:40.040 --> 3:33:42.040]  is calling for maximum pressure on Russia
[3:33:42.040 --> 3:33:44.040]  Bill Crystal
[3:33:44.040 --> 3:33:46.040]  again son of the head
[3:33:46.040 --> 3:33:48.040]  of the communist 4th international
[3:33:48.040 --> 3:33:50.040]  has had the third largest military presence
[3:33:50.040 --> 3:33:52.040]  about 2,000 troops
[3:33:52.040 --> 3:33:54.040]  fighting along US soldiers and Marines
[3:33:54.040 --> 3:33:56.040]  for this reason alone we owe Georgia a serious effort
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:33:58.040]  to defend its sovereignty
[3:33:58.040 --> 3:34:00.040]  surely we cannot simply stand by
[3:34:00.040 --> 3:34:02.040]  as an autocratic aggressor gobbles
[3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:04.040]  up part of and perhaps destabilizes
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:06.040]  all of a friendly democratic nation
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:08.040]  what an incredible statement
[3:34:08.040 --> 3:34:10.040]  we must strike, we must hit
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:12.040]  and Cheney said that
[3:34:12.040 --> 3:34:14.040]  I can get you his actual quote
[3:34:14.040 --> 3:34:16.040]  he said that there will be a serious response
[3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:18.040]  there will be a response
[3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:20.040]  Betrayus is flying C-130s full of Georgian troops
[3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:22.040]  up to the battle lines
[3:34:22.040 --> 3:34:24.040]  this is insane, this could turn into World War 3
[3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:26.040]  Washington Times reports it is the American
[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:28.040]  interest to exert maximum pressure
[3:34:28.040 --> 3:34:30.040]  on Russia withdraw its troops
[3:34:30.040 --> 3:34:32.040]  and halt the interference from Georgian territory
[3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:34.040]  the latest act shows the need for greater resolve
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:36.040]  in establishing a European security system
[3:34:36.040 --> 3:34:38.040]  that can be effective check on Russian power
[3:34:38.040 --> 3:34:40.040]  kind of like when they went into the former Russian territory
[3:34:40.040 --> 3:34:42.040]  of Serbia blew the daylights out of it
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:44.040]  brought Muslims in
[3:34:44.040 --> 3:34:46.040]  and then told the American people that
[3:34:46.040 --> 3:34:48.040]  Serbia attacked Albania just it's unbelievable
[3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:50.040]  writing in the Washington Post today
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:52.040]  Robert Kagan goes even further
[3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:54.040]  suggesting that Georgian-Russian conflict
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:56.040]  may be the start of World War 3
[3:34:56.040 --> 3:34:58.040]  and he goes on to say that
[3:34:58.040 --> 3:35:00.040]  I mean I want to go back
[3:35:00.040 --> 3:35:02.040]  to Brendan and others that are patiently holding
[3:35:02.040 --> 3:35:04.040]  but Lindsay Williams
[3:35:04.040 --> 3:35:06.040]  they are all over TV, all over radio
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:08.040]  all over the quote liberal media
[3:35:08.040 --> 3:35:10.040]  all over everything saying Russia started this
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:12.040]  they have total
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:14.040]  contempt for the American people
[3:35:14.040 --> 3:35:16.040]  they treat us like we are
[3:35:16.040 --> 3:35:18.040]  three-year-olds
[3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:20.040]  who've been beaten upside the head
[3:35:20.040 --> 3:35:22.040]  but I guess that's what we are
[3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:24.040]  because most people I talk to
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:26.040]  really think Russia out of a clear
[3:35:26.040 --> 3:35:28.040]  day just suddenly
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:30.040]  attacked for no reason last week
[3:35:30.040 --> 3:35:32.040]  when it's admitted
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:34.040]  that US backed and Israeli backed
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:36.040]  Georgian with those troops involved
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:38.040]  our troops involved attacked
[3:35:38.040 --> 3:35:40.040]  and slaughtered and blew up a couple cities
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:42.040]  I mean this is incredible
[3:35:42.040 --> 3:35:44.040]  Lindsay Williams
[3:35:44.040 --> 3:35:46.040]  the elite make fortunes
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:48.040]  off of both sides of war
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:50.040]  First World War, Second World War
[3:35:50.040 --> 3:35:52.040]  what's happening in Iraq
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:54.040]  what's going to happen in Iran
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:56.040]  what's happening over in Georgia
[3:35:56.040 --> 3:35:58.040]  they play both sides, they supply to both sides
[3:35:58.040 --> 3:36:00.040]  and the elite
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:02.040]  are socialistic
[3:36:02.040 --> 3:36:04.040]  I lived with them for three years Alec
[3:36:04.040 --> 3:36:06.040]  this is the privilege that I had
[3:36:06.040 --> 3:36:08.040]  that the average person sits off and says
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:10.040]  well I think this, this, this, this
[3:36:10.040 --> 3:36:12.040]  I lived with these people for three years
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:14.040]  they own soil
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:16.040]  they love conflicts like this
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:18.040]  and the more they can get us into this
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:20.040]  the more they're going to enjoy it
[3:36:20.040 --> 3:36:22.040]  and make fortunes off of it
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:24.040]  Lindsay in your educated opinion
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:26.040]  do we have a hope and a prayer of de-escalating this
[3:36:26.040 --> 3:36:28.040]  or do the elites just not give a
[3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:30.040]  you know what
[3:36:30.040 --> 3:36:32.040]  everything revolves around
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:34.040]  one subject and one subject only
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:36.040]  and that is crude oil
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:38.040]  and whoever it is that won't build
[3:36:38.040 --> 3:36:40.040]  that pipeline won't secrude oil
[3:36:40.040 --> 3:36:42.040]  out of Georgia
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:44.040]  and once a natural gas out of Georgia
[3:36:44.040 --> 3:36:46.040]  they're going to fight for it
[3:36:46.040 --> 3:36:48.040]  life means nothing because crude oil
[3:36:48.040 --> 3:36:50.040]  is a standard currency of the world
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:36:52.040]  and in some way
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:54.040]  connect in your mind and everything you see on the news
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:36:56.040]  about crude oil and natural gas
[3:36:56.040 --> 3:36:58.040]  in relation to Georgia
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:37:00.040]  and you know which way this thing is going
[3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:02.040]  I have to agree with you
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:04.040]  very, very serious ladies and gentlemen
[3:37:04.040 --> 3:37:06.040]  very, very
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:08.040]  serious
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:10.040]  there's so much incredible news in the past
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:12.040]  one story like
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:14.040]  confirmed U.S. mercenaries are being captured
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:16.040]  one of them is an African American
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:18.040]  in their
[3:37:18.040 --> 3:37:20.040]  leading troops attacking the Russians
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:22.040]  this is an incredible
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:24.040]  provocation six months ago
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:26.040]  three months ago a month ago
[3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:28.040]  the Russian foreign ministry
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:30.040]  threatened to aim their nukes at the U.S.
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:32.040]  again and said we will use nukes if you keep
[3:37:32.040 --> 3:37:34.040]  moving weapons systems into Ukraine
[3:37:34.040 --> 3:37:36.040]  into Georgia
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:38.040]  into Czech Republic and they just don't care
[3:37:38.040 --> 3:37:40.040]  they're doing it
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:42.040]  now some people say the new order plays both sides
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:44.040]  you're right they do play both sides
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:46.040]  but are they in control of both sides
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:48.040]  we know and it's been in the financial times of London
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:50.040]  that every time they arrest one of the oligarchs
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:52.040]  the ten or so that really owned Russia
[3:37:52.040 --> 3:37:54.040]  that arrested like six of them
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:37:56.040]  that they always then once they're in jail
[3:37:56.040 --> 3:37:58.040]  international agreements were already signed
[3:37:58.040 --> 3:38:00.040]  where it's transferred to the Rothschilds
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:02.040]  who were the secret owners
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:04.040]  and yes folks
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:06.040]  we're in England
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:08.040]  so it also looks like Russia may actually be
[3:38:08.040 --> 3:38:10.040]  at some level a rogue element
[3:38:10.040 --> 3:38:12.040]  inside the new world order
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:14.040]  but you're saying your oil company source says no
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:16.040]  they're teamed up with Russia
[3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:18.040]  well
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:20.040]  yes they've got to be in order to produce
[3:38:20.040 --> 3:38:22.040]  they know they have known
[3:38:22.040 --> 3:38:24.040]  a long time in advance far enough in advance
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:26.040]  that the CEO
[3:38:26.040 --> 3:38:28.040]  of ExxonMobil Oil Company
[3:38:28.040 --> 3:38:30.040]  on May the third oh eight said
[3:38:30.040 --> 3:38:32.040]  crude oil should be fifty dollars a barrel
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:34.040]  now go look it up you can find it in the web
[3:38:34.040 --> 3:38:36.040]  it hits the national news
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:38.040]  May the third of oh eight
[3:38:38.040 --> 3:38:40.040]  and for these oil company
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:42.040]  top people to make these statements
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:44.040]  and then this man eight weeks ago
[3:38:44.040 --> 3:38:46.040]  to tell me exactly where these oil fields are
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:48.040]  that they were going to bring online
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:50.040]  and for the retired CEO
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:52.040]  of Shell Oil to state
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:54.040]  on Monday June the second of oh eight
[3:38:54.040 --> 3:38:56.040]  America must have a new
[3:38:56.040 --> 3:38:58.040]  energy policy
[3:38:58.040 --> 3:39:00.040]  but he wasn't talking about an energy policy
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:02.040]  developing our own oil fields
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:04.040]  but an energy policy of developing
[3:39:04.040 --> 3:39:06.040]  the huge oil fields in Indonesia
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:08.040]  north of Russia destroying the Arabs
[3:39:08.040 --> 3:39:10.040]  totally and when people
[3:39:10.040 --> 3:39:12.040]  if people can put all this together
[3:39:12.040 --> 3:39:14.040]  Alex they're going to see exactly
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:16.040]  what these people are doing and every bit
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:18.040]  relates to
[3:39:18.040 --> 3:39:20.040]  all of these things are planned behind closed
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:22.040]  doors and when this man said this to me
[3:39:22.040 --> 3:39:24.040]  eight weeks ago
[3:39:24.040 --> 3:39:26.040]  he knew everything that
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:28.040]  they had talked about all the plans that they
[3:39:28.040 --> 3:39:30.040]  made now he did not mention Georgia
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:32.040]  he did mention the fact that Russia
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:34.040]  is going to become one of the major
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:36.040]  powers on the face of the earth
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:38.040]  because they're going to become rich like
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:40.040]  the Arabs are right now
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:42.040]  then you put together that along with the socialism
[3:39:42.040 --> 3:39:44.040]  of Russia
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:46.040]  and bring in the oil to give them
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:48.040]  the finances that they need to be able to do
[3:39:48.040 --> 3:39:50.040]  things that nobody have thought
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:52.040]  that anybody so Russia's been playing
[3:39:52.040 --> 3:39:54.040]  possum all the globalist brought down in
[3:39:54.040 --> 3:39:56.040]  bankrupted the US which is what all the old timers
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:39:58.040]  fifty years ago said the plan really was
[3:39:58.040 --> 3:40:00.040]  I want to be clear
[3:40:00.040 --> 3:40:02.040]  Joseph McCarthy was an alcoholic
[3:40:02.040 --> 3:40:04.040]  he thought he was
[3:40:04.040 --> 3:40:06.040]  a marine who flew dangerous combat
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:08.040]  photography missions
[3:40:08.040 --> 3:40:10.040]  over Japan and his plane got shot up
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:12.040]  quite a few times he was the real deal
[3:40:12.040 --> 3:40:14.040]  they make movies demonizing him
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:16.040]  make him look like a fool he wasn't perfect
[3:40:16.040 --> 3:40:18.040]  he wasn't that sophisticated
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:20.040]  but then he found out about the new world
[3:40:20.040 --> 3:40:22.040]  order I've talked to people that knew him and worked with him
[3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:24.040]  they were allowing him to
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:26.040]  set up a police state in the US
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:28.040]  the name of fighting communism to really persecute the left
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:30.040]  and create censorship boards for the FBI
[3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:32.040]  but as soon as he found out
[3:40:32.040 --> 3:40:34.040]  and said the army the air force
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:36.040]  everybody works for the communist
[3:40:36.040 --> 3:40:38.040]  he goes no wait they're funding the communist
[3:40:38.040 --> 3:40:40.040]  as soon as he found out
[3:40:40.040 --> 3:40:42.040]  that they had put Mao say tongue into power
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:44.040]  which is now declassified mainstream history
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:46.040]  our government put Mao in
[3:40:46.040 --> 3:40:48.040]  they set them up after the boxer rebellion
[3:40:48.040 --> 3:40:50.040]  a hundred and ten years ago
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:52.040]  and then had him fight the Japanese
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:54.040]  and then didn't give Shanghai check the weapons
[3:40:54.040 --> 3:40:56.040]  the point is it turned out he was right
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:58.040]  but it wasn't communism it was globalism
[3:40:58.040 --> 3:41:00.040]  this is Carol Quigley
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:02.040]  at Georgetown said Bill Clinton's mentor
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:04.040]  that had a political science there
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:06.040]  that the international round table groups based in London
[3:41:06.040 --> 3:41:08.040]  use and own
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:10.040]  all the groups and finance them all
[3:41:10.040 --> 3:41:12.040]  but they like to work with communists and fascists
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:14.040]  because they centralized control
[3:41:14.040 --> 3:41:16.040]  which they can then
[3:41:16.040 --> 3:41:18.040]  create a global government with
[3:41:18.040 --> 3:41:20.040]  and so that's what's happening
[3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:22.040]  and as soon as McCarthy found out
[3:41:22.040 --> 3:41:24.040]  that the military was
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:26.040]  quote backing the communists which later all came out
[3:41:26.040 --> 3:41:28.040]  giving them nukes, weapons, aluminum
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:30.040]  plants, everything
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:32.040]  that's when they had to shut him down and make him look like a fool
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:34.040]  now
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:36.040]  let's go back to Brendan in Australia
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:38.040]  finish up Brendan
[3:41:38.040 --> 3:41:40.040]  I was just going to say
[3:41:40.040 --> 3:41:42.040]  today Kevin Rudd the prime minister of Australia
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:44.040]  went to Korea
[3:41:44.040 --> 3:41:46.040]  and they've got like a big story about how he's talking about
[3:41:46.040 --> 3:41:48.040]  Australian beef and what not
[3:41:48.040 --> 3:41:50.040]  so most of the media just left it out
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:52.040]  but a few of them are starting to pick it up
[3:41:52.040 --> 3:41:54.040]  he's also the main reason he went there
[3:41:54.040 --> 3:41:56.040]  was to push his Asia Pacific community
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:41:58.040]  the Asian Union
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:00.040]  Asian Pacific Union which is
[3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:02.040]  and when you read it they call it a union
[3:42:02.040 --> 3:42:04.040]  just like the African Union
[3:42:04.040 --> 3:42:06.040]  the Caribbean Union they're trying to set up
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:08.040]  the South American Union was signed
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:10.040]  five weeks ago
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:12.040]  the African Union's been around for ten years
[3:42:12.040 --> 3:42:14.040]  and then major news publications
[3:42:14.040 --> 3:42:16.040]  wrote articles
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:18.040]  in the last two weeks several of them saying
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:20.040]  I'm insane that the African Union
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:22.040]  doesn't exist
[3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:24.040]  they're living in a delusional
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:26.040]  la la land
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:28.040]  I mean it's all over the foreign press
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:30.040]  they're having meetings, they have international
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:32.040]  bodies
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:34.040]  that are set up, they have the African Union set up
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:36.040]  and the media says it doesn't exist
[3:42:38.040 --> 3:42:40.040]  even now, even the news is saying
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:42.040]  it's going to be like a European Union style
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:44.040]  community, they call it a community
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:46.040]  but you're allowed to see that in Australia
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:48.040]  they know Americans are so dumb
[3:42:48.040 --> 3:42:50.040]  I mean everybody's been dumbed down
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:42:52.040]  in the West but we win, we're the winners
[3:42:52.040 --> 3:42:54.040]  I mean we win by several
[3:42:54.040 --> 3:42:56.040]  lengths
[3:42:56.040 --> 3:42:58.040]  it's not winning by a nose
[3:42:58.040 --> 3:43:00.040]  I mean it's just
[3:43:00.040 --> 3:43:02.040]  I'm not being mean here, it's a fact
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:04.040]  just literally
[3:43:04.040 --> 3:43:06.040]  none of it exists, government's always good
[3:43:06.040 --> 3:43:08.040]  there's no elite
[3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:10.040]  there's no
[3:43:10.040 --> 3:43:12.040]  thank you for the call sir
[3:43:12.040 --> 3:43:14.040]  absolutely
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:16.040]  they said a year ago, because I was finishing
[3:43:16.040 --> 3:43:18.040]  in-game at the time, I've got the mainstream
[3:43:18.040 --> 3:43:20.040]  articles in the film, they said that they
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:22.040]  were now making the Asian
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:24.040]  economic group
[3:43:24.040 --> 3:43:26.040]  what is it, APEC
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:28.040]  similar to APEC, not the same thing
[3:43:28.040 --> 3:43:30.040]  that it was now a Union
[3:43:30.040 --> 3:43:32.040]  it was in major Australian, Japanese
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:34.040]  papers, doesn't exist, they're in America
[3:43:34.040 --> 3:43:36.040]  hell, they may start saying Japan
[3:43:36.040 --> 3:43:38.040]  doesn't exist
[3:43:38.040 --> 3:43:40.040]  Americans, I'm not kidding
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:42.040]  I mean they may say nothing exists
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:44.040]  but Budweiser and acting tough
[3:43:44.040 --> 3:43:46.040]  Lindsay Williams, do you get the point I'm trying
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:48.040]  to make here?
[3:43:48.040 --> 3:43:50.040]  Oh you're exactly right Alex, in fact everything
[3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:52.040]  that you've been saying over these years
[3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:54.040]  and even though I don't get to talk to you that much in person
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:43:56.040]  I follow you very carefully
[3:43:56.040 --> 3:43:58.040]  these elites have everything
[3:43:58.040 --> 3:44:00.040]  planned in advance
[3:44:00.040 --> 3:44:02.040]  and when this gentleman called me eight weeks ago
[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:04.040]  and told me these things were going to happen
[3:44:04.040 --> 3:44:06.040]  I was utterly flabbergasted to hear
[3:44:06.040 --> 3:44:08.040]  the things that they have already
[3:44:08.040 --> 3:44:10.040]  on the drawing board
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:12.040]  and all of this gets together
[3:44:12.040 --> 3:44:14.040]  understand one thing everybody out there
[3:44:14.040 --> 3:44:16.040]  Alex, listening audience, the elite
[3:44:16.040 --> 3:44:18.040]  control the world, they control
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:20.040]  both sides
[3:44:20.040 --> 3:44:22.040]  they control what's happening over there in Iraq
[3:44:22.040 --> 3:44:24.040]  they control Iran, they control
[3:44:24.040 --> 3:44:26.040]  Russia, they control what's happening
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:28.040]  in America and the elite pull
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:30.040]  the strings, everybody in congress
[3:44:30.040 --> 3:44:32.040]  immediately says how do you want to jump
[3:44:32.040 --> 3:44:34.040]  whenever they say jump
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:36.040]  and the president does too
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:38.040]  well I mean the evidence of that is
[3:44:38.040 --> 3:44:40.040]  90 plus percent want to control
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:42.040]  the borders, both parties say shut up
[3:44:42.040 --> 3:44:44.040]  you know like a little SWAT team will drop by
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:46.040]  80 percent went out of the war
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:48.040]  they say it ain't ever ending
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:50.040]  they just do whatever they want whenever they want
[3:44:50.040 --> 3:44:52.040]  let's jam in a few final calls
[3:44:52.040 --> 3:44:54.040]  for you, John and New Hampshire, then Rusty
[3:44:54.040 --> 3:44:56.040]  Cody, Jennifer and Jeremy, real fast
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:44:58.040]  John go ahead
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:45:00.040]  I just want to say, I mean Billy Crystal
[3:45:00.040 --> 3:45:02.040]  such a scumbag, I mean the guy's like a little war lord
[3:45:02.040 --> 3:45:04.040]  every time you see him
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:06.040]  don't even think people take the guy seriously anymore
[3:45:06.040 --> 3:45:08.040]  oh really, they're attacking Russia right now
[3:45:08.040 --> 3:45:10.040]  they are, you're right
[3:45:10.040 --> 3:45:12.040]  about that, but he's
[3:45:12.040 --> 3:45:14.040]  a conservative
[3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:16.040]  well I mean he's a Trotsky, that's the new conservative
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:18.040]  well I want to ask Lindsey
[3:45:18.040 --> 3:45:20.040]  how do you see this for
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:22.040]  the United States playing out, I mean
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:24.040]  how much do you think we're going to escalate this
[3:45:24.040 --> 3:45:26.040]  and then do you
[3:45:26.040 --> 3:45:28.040]  think if we start engaging with them
[3:45:28.040 --> 3:45:30.040]  do you see China getting into this at all
[3:45:30.040 --> 3:45:32.040]  well it kind of gets into
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:34.040]  we're really in big trouble
[3:45:34.040 --> 3:45:36.040]  biblically you find China
[3:45:36.040 --> 3:45:38.040]  and you find Russia
[3:45:38.040 --> 3:45:40.040]  it is equal to chapter 38 and 39
[3:45:40.040 --> 3:45:42.040]  you put these nations together
[3:45:42.040 --> 3:45:44.040]  and you've got World War 3
[3:45:44.040 --> 3:45:46.040]  if it goes to the point
[3:45:46.040 --> 3:45:48.040]  you know what, that's a great point John briefly
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:50.040]  and I'll just keep it to the end of the show
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:52.040]  but I've got a few things I've got to plug
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:54.040]  and I want to plug your stuff, Lindsey Williams briefly
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:45:56.040]  as a Baptist minister
[3:45:56.040 --> 3:45:58.040]  looking at your perspective on the scriptures
[3:45:58.040 --> 3:46:00.040]  and I'm going from memory here
[3:46:00.040 --> 3:46:02.040]  doesn't the Antichrist blow the daylights
[3:46:02.040 --> 3:46:04.040]  out of a Russian group
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:06.040]  and then later the Russians and the Chinese come back
[3:46:06.040 --> 3:46:08.040]  or fill me in briefly on that
[3:46:08.040 --> 3:46:10.040]  you're exactly right
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:12.040]  he literally
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:14.040]  decimates certain parts of the world
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:16.040]  Russia will eventually be destroyed
[3:46:16.040 --> 3:46:18.040]  China
[3:46:18.040 --> 3:46:20.040]  oh my goodness, China's got some exciting
[3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:22.040]  days ahead, the United States
[3:46:22.040 --> 3:46:24.040]  of America is going to
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:26.040]  really take a back seat, we are going to become
[3:46:26.040 --> 3:46:28.040]  a nil
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:30.040]  how should I put it
[3:46:30.040 --> 3:46:32.040]  a nil circumstance in the world
[3:46:32.040 --> 3:46:34.040]  a third world kind of backwater cesspit
[3:46:34.040 --> 3:46:36.040]  yeah we are going to
[3:46:36.040 --> 3:46:38.040]  take a back seat from this point on
[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:40.040]  any way you look at it
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:42.040]  because we've been neutralized, sucked by the bankers
[3:46:42.040 --> 3:46:44.040]  anything else John?
[3:46:44.040 --> 3:46:46.040]  I'm going to ask you, I know
[3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:48.040]  gold dropped the last time I looked like 820
[3:46:48.040 --> 3:46:50.040]  an ounce
[3:46:50.040 --> 3:46:52.040]  do you think that's going to trend with
[3:46:52.040 --> 3:46:54.040]  oil, where do you think the bottom
[3:46:54.040 --> 3:46:56.040]  is for precious metals
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:46:58.040]  historically gold and oil are always going together
[3:46:58.040 --> 3:47:00.040]  I do not think that's going to continue
[3:47:00.040 --> 3:47:02.040]  now this is only a prediction
[3:47:02.040 --> 3:47:04.040]  I agree with you Alex
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:06.040]  I've got to call this man back and ask him some more questions
[3:47:06.040 --> 3:47:08.040]  if he's willing to answer me
[3:47:08.040 --> 3:47:10.040]  it's my opinion
[3:47:10.040 --> 3:47:12.040]  if you have a devaluing dollar, it doesn't matter what oil does
[3:47:12.040 --> 3:47:14.040]  the gold's going to go up
[3:47:14.040 --> 3:47:16.040]  because it's denominated in dollars
[3:47:16.040 --> 3:47:18.040]  yeah I think oil and gold are going to break
[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:20.040]  I do not think they're going to stay together
[3:47:20.040 --> 3:47:22.040]  as they've done in the past, I think they're going to break
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:24.040]  I was just in touch this morning
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:26.040]  with a gold dealer
[3:47:26.040 --> 3:47:28.040]  who had talked with the
[3:47:28.040 --> 3:47:30.040]  United States Mint
[3:47:30.040 --> 3:47:32.040]  he literally was on the phone with them this morning
[3:47:32.040 --> 3:47:34.040]  they said, we can't get
[3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:36.040]  any more silver for another 30 days
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:38.040]  they said, gold surprise
[3:47:38.040 --> 3:47:40.040]  they said no, Ted Anderson's in that business
[3:47:40.040 --> 3:47:42.040]  he's having trouble getting gold
[3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:44.040]  and the silver's gone
[3:47:44.040 --> 3:47:46.040]  except for dimes, thank you for the call John
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:48.040]  Rusty in Arkansas
[3:47:48.040 --> 3:47:50.040]  you're on the air
[3:47:50.040 --> 3:47:52.040]  I just wanted to mention
[3:47:52.040 --> 3:47:54.040]  I remember back on the first Alex
[3:47:54.040 --> 3:47:56.040]  it was like the Friday after
[3:47:56.040 --> 3:47:58.040]  Lindsay first came on
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:00.040]  she had mentioned, I believe
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:02.040]  Bob Chapman was on with you
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:04.040]  and you'd stated that you'd believe
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:06.040]  that possibly that the contact that Lindsay had
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:08.040]  might have given some disinformation
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:10.040]  like I said earlier
[3:48:10.040 --> 3:48:12.040]  the globalists
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:14.040]  you never know what they're going to do
[3:48:14.040 --> 3:48:16.040]  this could be a curve ball
[3:48:16.040 --> 3:48:18.040]  and so that's what I was saying
[3:48:18.040 --> 3:48:20.040]  you'd mentioned there too
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:22.040]  Bob I believe said that
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:24.040]  it would normally take about one to two years
[3:48:24.040 --> 3:48:26.040]  to get a refinery up and going over there
[3:48:26.040 --> 3:48:28.040]  to introduce them
[3:48:28.040 --> 3:48:30.040]  is that actually the case Lindsay
[3:48:30.040 --> 3:48:32.040]  or would they already have something in place
[3:48:32.040 --> 3:48:34.040]  or what do you see about that
[3:48:34.040 --> 3:48:36.040]  one of the first things that came to my mind
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:38.040]  after I talked with this man eight weeks ago was
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:40.040]  he is trying to
[3:48:40.040 --> 3:48:42.040]  literally make me look like a fool
[3:48:42.040 --> 3:48:44.040]  he's trying to totally discredit everything
[3:48:44.040 --> 3:48:46.040]  I've done for the past 35 years
[3:48:46.040 --> 3:48:48.040]  and even Dr. Stan said Lindsay
[3:48:48.040 --> 3:48:50.040]  don't you think he might be wanting to do that to you
[3:48:50.040 --> 3:48:52.040]  and all of us thought that until
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:54.040]  Fox News on July the 24th
[3:48:54.040 --> 3:48:56.040]  announced this huge oil find
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:48:58.040]  all the pressure got a jump got a jump
[3:48:58.040 --> 3:49:00.040]  got a jump thank you Rusty
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:02.040]  Cody in Arizona you're on the air with him go ahead
[3:49:02.040 --> 3:49:04.040]  yeah I actually
[3:49:04.040 --> 3:49:06.040]  got some great guests on lately
[3:49:06.040 --> 3:49:08.040]  I got a question for each of you first of all
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:10.040]  I was in the Coast Guard on September 11th
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:12.040]  the next day
[3:49:12.040 --> 3:49:14.040]  you'd mentioned quite a few times that
[3:49:14.040 --> 3:49:16.040]  you know the FBI had been out there spreading
[3:49:16.040 --> 3:49:18.040]  dis info
[3:49:18.040 --> 3:49:20.040]  and on that day because of my position
[3:49:20.040 --> 3:49:22.040]  I was handed probably about a stack
[3:49:22.040 --> 3:49:24.040]  of 20 pages of Middle Eastern
[3:49:24.040 --> 3:49:26.040]  men and women's names
[3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:28.040]  and it just seems to me that
[3:49:28.040 --> 3:49:30.040]  it should have been in a marked
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:32.040]  envelope either classified
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:34.040]  you know secret
[3:49:34.040 --> 3:49:36.040]  so my question for you
[3:49:36.040 --> 3:49:38.040]  is shouldn't you believe
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:40.040]  that that should have been marked
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:42.040]  I've talked to a lot of troops that I know
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:44.040]  who on
[3:49:44.040 --> 3:49:46.040]  the morning of 9-11
[3:49:46.040 --> 3:49:48.040]  including Cory Rowe
[3:49:48.040 --> 3:49:50.040]  this happened to him because he'd already joined
[3:49:50.040 --> 3:49:52.040]  they brought him in before the attacks
[3:49:52.040 --> 3:49:54.040]  happened had him sit down then walked in
[3:49:54.040 --> 3:49:56.040]  and turned the TV on right as it happened
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:49:58.040]  and said we're going to war
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:00.040]  and I mean so that's
[3:50:00.040 --> 3:50:02.040]  that's how they were programming people
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:04.040]  your comments on that Lindsay
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:08.040]  yeah everything that you've said about 9-11
[3:50:08.040 --> 3:50:10.040]  is true Alex
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:12.040]  and that gives you an idea how reckless this
[3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:14.040]  new world order crowd is anything else Cody
[3:50:14.040 --> 3:50:16.040]  uh yeah just uh
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:18.040]  I'm going to jam you in Cody and Jennifer
[3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:20.040]  sorry to Jeremy I'll have time for two more calls

[3:55:41.060 --> 3:55:44.740]  member's quality so they get a view of what it looks like. Okay, very quickly, Cody in
[3:55:44.740 --> 3:55:47.580]  Arizona, Coast Guard, go ahead and finish your point.
[3:55:47.580 --> 3:55:54.740]  Yeah, Lindsay, I just have some friends that moved up to Wyoming to work in the oil fields.
[3:55:54.740 --> 3:56:00.420]  And I'm curious if you're aware of any foreign interest up in that area, you know, Russian
[3:56:00.420 --> 3:56:04.460]  or any other countries that might be involved?
[3:56:04.460 --> 3:56:08.540]  Russia would not need to have an interest in it at all because they have just had discovered
[3:56:08.540 --> 3:56:13.260]  in the northern part of Russia this huge oil field that has such major amounts and it's
[3:56:13.260 --> 3:56:14.660]  almost unbelievable.
[3:56:14.660 --> 3:56:16.140]  And see, none of that affects Americans.
[3:56:16.140 --> 3:56:17.340]  No foreign interest there at all.
[3:56:17.340 --> 3:56:21.060]  None of this affects the U.S. If they allow more oil out of Alaska, it's just going to
[3:56:21.060 --> 3:56:26.140]  be given to Asia. We are known as the dumb cows. We are known as the people to be abused.
[3:56:26.140 --> 3:56:31.380]  Okay, so we don't get any of our oil anyways. Very little of it. Thank you, Cody. Jennifer
[3:56:31.380 --> 3:56:33.380]  in Tennessee, last caller.
[3:56:33.380 --> 3:56:35.380]  Are you there?
[3:56:35.380 --> 3:56:36.380]  Yes, I am Jennifer.
[3:56:36.380 --> 3:56:41.380]  Okay, I have a question for Lindsay. Last time you were on Alex's show, you had mentioned
[3:56:41.380 --> 3:56:46.820]  that you thought by the end of the summer that gas would go up $1 a gallon before it
[3:56:46.820 --> 3:56:49.220]  reached $50 a barrel, but since you were on...
[3:56:49.220 --> 3:56:52.220]  I don't believe you. I don't remember him saying that. I think he said it was going
[3:56:52.220 --> 3:56:53.220]  to start dropping then.
[3:56:53.220 --> 3:56:58.700]  Well, I thought I had to say that he thought the gas would go up $1 a gallon before it
[3:56:58.700 --> 3:56:59.700]  reached $50 a barrel.
[3:56:59.700 --> 3:57:00.700]  Lindsay, did you say that?
[3:57:00.700 --> 3:57:05.100]  If the individual that talked with me eight weeks ago, he said that the price of gasoline
[3:57:05.100 --> 3:57:09.420]  will probably go up a little higher before it drops. Now, if you'd like to know everything
[3:57:09.420 --> 3:57:14.700]  that I was told by one of the people who knows all that's happening behind closed doors,
[3:57:14.700 --> 3:57:20.140]  a man that is close to the elitist as I probably have ever known, please, I beg of you to get
[3:57:20.140 --> 3:57:28.860]  my analysis of what he said as well as everything he said on a DVD and a CD. Please dial this
[3:57:28.860 --> 3:57:40.540]  number, 800-321-2900. The title of it is the next 12 months, 800-321-2900.
[3:57:40.540 --> 3:57:44.540]  Lindsay, we're going to have to have you back up later this week if you're going to do it.
[3:57:44.540 --> 3:57:47.980]  We are flat out of time. Thank you for spending time with us today.
[3:57:47.980 --> 3:57:51.700]  Thank you, Alex, and folks, listen to everything Alex has to say. He's giving it to you day
[3:57:51.700 --> 3:57:54.140]  after day, don't miss a single broadcast.
[3:57:54.140 --> 3:57:56.540]  Thank you, Lindsay Williams. God bless and take care.
[3:57:56.540 --> 3:58:02.140]  Re-broadcast with Michelle Chasodosky, the professor. We also had on a lot of other great
[3:58:02.140 --> 3:58:08.860]  folks today. Amy Allen, and of course, that interview you just heard. At infowars.com,
[3:58:08.860 --> 3:58:19.300]  every transmission is now infowars.com.
