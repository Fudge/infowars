[11:26.560 --> 11:29.400]  for it because the states are upset because they've got to pay for
[11:29.400 --> 11:33.200]  implementation when it's an unfunded mandate but it'll still be a standardized
[11:33.200 --> 11:39.160]  ID guess what happened when I read the article because see Obama that's what

[13:39.760 --> 13:43.640]  and they just find an endless army of people that'll fall down before them and
[13:43.640 --> 13:51.240]  do whatever they're told this homeland security chief seeks to repeal ID act
[13:51.240 --> 13:57.880]  you read that oh goodie man look at Obama a post 9-11 law that sets federal
[13:57.880 --> 14:01.960]  standards for state driver's license identification cards is under fire from
[14:01.960 --> 14:05.640]  the head of the agency enforcing that law the Department of Homeland Security
[14:05.640 --> 14:10.080]  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Apolitano this week said she is working
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.640]  with governors to repeal the real ID act which was passed in 2005 and when to
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.960]  effect last year the bill is popular in Washington but is scorned by many
[14:18.960 --> 14:25.160]  governors who bear the responsibility for cost see they say it's about cost it's
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.560]  not about having a federal ID that's globally standardized really a world
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.240]  ID it's not about having to have that to have a job but illegal aliens are exempt
[14:33.240 --> 14:40.240]  under the federal law it's not about that oh no it's just about the cost and see
[14:40.240 --> 14:43.200]  all this like blueprints flashed up before my mind right before I even read
[14:43.200 --> 14:46.480]  the article I was it was literally like someone oh that'll be what it says and I
[14:46.480 --> 14:52.720]  read it and it was what I word for word I know the enemy and I just keep saying
[14:52.720 --> 14:58.720]  that because it's so frustrating Homeland Security Secretary Janet
[14:58.720 --> 15:01.960]  Apolitano this week said she is working with governors to repeal the real ID
[15:01.960 --> 15:06.760]  act which was passed 2005 I wanted to affect last year and see they're doing
[15:06.760 --> 15:09.680]  this because most the states are saying no liberals conservatives have figured
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.000]  out it's bad they're coming together and so they're going oh we hear you we're
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.640]  because they're failing they're going to repackage it just like the NAFTA
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.600]  highways just like the wars just like everything
[15:21.600 --> 15:28.040]  Apolitano former governor of Arkansas of Arizona suddenly can't read Apolitano
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.200]  former governor of Arizona said she has met with governors of both parties
[15:33.200 --> 15:39.120]  recently quote to look at a way to repeal real ID now here's the key here's
[15:39.120 --> 15:49.400]  the key she said she wants to substitute the federal law with something else that
[15:49.400 --> 15:57.320]  pivots off the driver's license but accomplishes some of the same goals and
[15:57.320 --> 16:02.760]  we hope to be able to announce something on that fairly soon now the
[16:02.760 --> 16:06.480]  blueprint since 1993 with Bill Clinton's executive order it's in my first film
[16:06.480 --> 16:16.800]  America destroyed by design Cicera in 1997 is that they already federalized
[16:16.800 --> 16:21.300]  everything through the state police through the DMV's in 93 put in thumb
[16:21.300 --> 16:28.200]  scanners put in digital photo for face scan template grid all MIT Pentagon
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.400]  designed on record and it's already in place they just want to make you have
[16:33.400 --> 16:37.240]  this to buy sell and have a job it's going to be tied to a national sales tax
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.560]  okay but the claim will replace the income tax they're going to keep both
[16:41.560 --> 16:48.320]  just watch read their own documents 12 years ago keep saying 10 it was actually
[16:48.320 --> 16:56.560]  12 now and here comes boards everybody pushing the sales tax that's their
[16:56.560 --> 16:59.280]  favorite trick they say they're going to one tax and they just bring in another
[16:59.280 --> 17:04.320]  one and keep all of them the Palatino made a remarks Tuesday in response to the
[17:04.320 --> 17:10.200]  question of a conference of the anti-defamation league always popping up
[17:10.200 --> 17:13.960]  on Wednesday representative James Simpson breeder Republican Wisconsin a
[17:13.960 --> 17:19.280]  sponsor of the law said he was angered about the Palatino's comments realized
[17:19.280 --> 17:23.280]  is a necessary program to keep America safe is the will of the Congress and

[33:35.800 --> 33:40.080]  no introduction congressman i have just a ton of important questions to ask you
[33:40.080 --> 33:44.080]  a bunch of listener emails that i promise to read on air and to bring up
[33:44.080 --> 33:49.160]  to you but out of the gates what is most important right now on your plate that
[33:49.160 --> 33:54.160]  you think the american people should be made aware of oh boy there's there's so
[33:54.160 --> 34:01.840]  many my i guess overall my biggest worry and concern is the attitude of this
[34:01.840 --> 34:07.080]  administration and the aggressiveness that they're expressing about against
[34:07.080 --> 34:11.400]  pakistan and i think that it looks like they're more willing to expand the war
[34:11.400 --> 34:16.960]  into pakistan and less likely into iran but if israel goes into iran we're going
[34:16.960 --> 34:22.360]  to be obligated which might be the precipitating event that will cause a
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.160]  collapse of the of the dollar because how are we going to be able to afford
[34:26.160 --> 34:32.560]  it so that that to me is strategically the big issue in a more casual way i
[34:32.560 --> 34:36.600]  guess the project i'm working on is trying to get as many people's possible
[34:36.600 --> 34:41.160]  to support this uh... audit bill you know twelve oh seven which i think it's
[34:41.160 --> 34:44.320]  i think it's the last i look i think we're up to eighty six on this we got a
[34:44.320 --> 34:50.480]  bunch of uh... of new co-sponsors of after they heard from their constituents
[34:50.480 --> 34:54.520]  back at home in this two-week break so what you do on the radio and what
[34:54.520 --> 34:58.960]  others do elsewhere must be alerting a lot of people because some members came
[34:58.960 --> 35:03.040]  up to me they said boy i had a couple town hall meetings and low and behold
[35:03.040 --> 35:06.640]  every time i had them there were three or four or five people saying area are
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.680]  you going to support the audit bill so those those would uh... those two issues
[35:11.680 --> 35:15.680]  would be the uh... things that i've been thinking about mostly playfully
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.360]  congressman i've really been studying this is i know you have for as long as
[35:19.360 --> 35:21.440]  i've probably alive but
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.800]  i've been studying the quickest way to bring down this corrupt system without
[35:25.800 --> 35:28.120]  them starting world war three or
[35:28.120 --> 35:31.140]  bringing in a police state or bankrupting us
[35:31.140 --> 35:34.000]  and as you said a month ago here on the show is
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.680]  have grand juries investigate the bankers they've certainly committed crimes
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.280]  uh... audit the fed and and and you call for auditing the fed and they
[35:42.280 --> 35:45.680]  arrogantly go on tv and say we're outside the government above the
[35:45.680 --> 35:46.480]  government
[35:46.480 --> 35:49.040]  i think you've hit on the issue
[35:49.040 --> 35:52.160]  not just going for abolishing the fed as you also have a bill and co-sponsors
[35:52.160 --> 35:52.760]  but
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.360]  auditing them i mean isn't the congress isn't some agency of government
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.480]  aren't the american people through our agents you the elected servants
[36:00.480 --> 36:04.360]  uh... having the power to audit this we can you speak to that fundamental and
[36:04.360 --> 36:06.240]  is this this is this
[36:06.240 --> 36:09.560]  the excalibur that can kill the dragon
[36:09.560 --> 36:13.400]  though we do have the authority and the moral responsibility of course
[36:13.400 --> 36:17.680]  we had no authority to create the fed its unconstitutional but it isn't
[36:17.680 --> 36:20.960]  private in the sense that somebody set up a private corporation all of a
[36:20.960 --> 36:22.600]  sudden became successful
[36:22.600 --> 36:27.080]  it has become secret but it's the authority comes from the congress
[36:27.080 --> 36:28.720]  and uh...
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.800]  the responsibility for the congress is to monitor everything that it is supposed
[36:32.800 --> 36:33.600]  to do
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.320]  uh... what it claims it's uh... it's supporting
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.920]  prior to nineteen seventy eight uh... there was talk of this you know the old
[36:41.920 --> 36:45.200]  populace of taxes uh... right happened and
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.000]  uh... people like hennigan dollars have always called for more openness and
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.160]  transparency
[36:50.160 --> 36:52.440]  uh... of the fed
[36:52.440 --> 36:54.640]  every time that came up the people with a
[36:54.640 --> 36:56.000]  where the g a l
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.160]  has no explicit authority
[36:58.160 --> 36:59.320]  to audit the fed
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.440]  so they wouldn't do it
[37:00.440 --> 37:04.040]  and that was the way they handled it but finally on assist insistence
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.880]  that the g a l have the authority in nineteen seventy eight they wrote a law
[37:07.880 --> 37:14.080]  it's had now the g a l has the authority to audit the fed except for
[37:14.080 --> 37:18.200]  poor big issues you know what and they were that was essentially everything
[37:18.200 --> 37:22.520]  important issues were excluded so in in legalizing in order of the fed they
[37:22.520 --> 37:26.680]  actually put it in the law that we couldn't find out any information
[37:26.680 --> 37:30.160]  so what we have to do in what my bill does its repeals
[37:30.160 --> 37:34.840]  uh... those prohibitions against uh... finding any information from the fed
[37:34.840 --> 37:38.160]  if we get the books open find out what they're doing where these trillions of
[37:38.160 --> 37:41.880]  dollars are going to their friends are what kind of corrupt government they
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.680]  support what central bank
[37:43.680 --> 37:46.880]  uh... activity there is and how much all this
[37:46.880 --> 37:50.200]  economic planning not only the best acly but internationally
[37:50.200 --> 37:55.280]  uh... i think then it's going to make it much easier to have monetary reform
[37:55.280 --> 37:57.960]  and do something to get rid of the fed
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.240]  so that's the bottom line we have to audit the bankers that have designed
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.360]  this implosion who are openly announcing g twenty bank of the world
[38:06.360 --> 38:09.280]  with a global regulatory authority can you speak
[38:09.280 --> 38:12.880]  to the fact that all these years you've written books uh... you've spoken we've
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.400]  talked about how they believe in globalism in one world government
[38:16.400 --> 38:19.240]  and now congressman they are
[38:19.240 --> 38:22.920]  openly coming out after they've engineered the crisis
[38:22.920 --> 38:27.280]  and they're saying the solution is giving us unlimited power
[38:27.280 --> 38:30.040]  that's that's what they've did and that's what they do we're doing it
[38:30.040 --> 38:33.200]  domestically and we're doing it internationally i think the
[38:33.200 --> 38:37.080]  uh... i am out of uh... made the proposals that they wanted
[38:37.080 --> 38:40.080]  like fifty million dollars and obama says well let's give him a hundred he
[38:40.080 --> 38:42.280]  doubled the amount they requested
[38:42.280 --> 38:47.600]  and uh... that's more power and into these international organizations at the
[38:47.600 --> 38:51.120]  same time look at all the powers gravitating to washington real estate
[38:51.120 --> 38:53.360]  but prices aren't going down in washington
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.440]  because there's so many people moving in
[38:55.440 --> 39:01.200]  uh... they uh... they have been doing this for years every time they create a
[39:01.200 --> 39:02.040]  problem
[39:02.040 --> 39:03.840]  they say well there's not enough power
[39:03.840 --> 39:05.360]  their explanation now
[39:05.360 --> 39:09.360]  and i think a key speech is that economic speech that obama gave
[39:09.360 --> 39:10.440]  you know he said
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.520]  what we do have problems and there's an emergency and we have to do this we
[39:14.520 --> 39:16.840]  don't have enough regulations that we need more
[39:16.840 --> 39:20.120]  government regulations and international regulation that means they're going to
[39:20.120 --> 39:21.840]  bring in these international government
[39:21.840 --> 39:26.200]  then he said well we have to do put more money in education with more money in
[39:26.200 --> 39:27.240]  nationalized
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.920]  uh... uh... medical care
[39:29.920 --> 39:34.440]  and then we also have to take over all uh... all this energy problem that we
[39:34.440 --> 39:34.960]  have
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.640]  but then his fifth part of his speech was
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.160]  we have to act responsibly we have to now divide
[39:42.160 --> 39:45.080]  a system of government where we act within our means
[39:45.080 --> 39:46.960]  and get this budget under control
[39:46.960 --> 39:50.480]  but we don't have to do that for a while let's do that in ten years from now
[39:50.480 --> 39:53.520]  i don't know how they can do that with a straight face
[39:53.520 --> 39:56.000]  and how the american people can swallow that
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.480]  at the same time they just
[39:57.480 --> 40:01.480]  see this financial crisis getting worse our liberties being diminished
[40:01.480 --> 40:03.160]  in world government growing
[40:03.160 --> 40:07.880]  so we have a desperate desperate struggle to wake up the american people
[40:07.880 --> 40:11.320]  but uh... on the more positive side there are more now
[40:11.320 --> 40:14.760]  who are becoming aware of what's happening and the worst the crisis get
[40:14.760 --> 40:16.600]  maybe more people will wake up
[40:16.600 --> 40:19.000]  and that's why i think the auditing the fed bill
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.840]  is important because they'll say
[40:20.840 --> 40:22.600]  because most people don't even know yet
[40:22.600 --> 40:24.880]  that we're not allowed to have this information
[40:24.880 --> 40:27.600]  met yesterday i got a co-sponsor that bill
[40:27.600 --> 40:29.480]  with somebody on the house floor
[40:29.480 --> 40:31.000]  and he wasn't aware
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.960]  any of this stuff he says you mean
[40:32.960 --> 40:36.880]  you mean we can't audit the federal reserve no never could and uh... there's
[40:36.880 --> 40:37.920]  no authority
[40:37.920 --> 40:40.080]  in their excluded he is signed me up
[40:40.080 --> 40:41.280]  so he immediately did
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.560]  so there's there's a lot of people who just don't understand this and
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.360]  and that means that uh... once the american people realize this
[40:48.360 --> 40:50.240]  they will get their congressman
[40:50.240 --> 40:51.600]  not to do something about it
[40:51.600 --> 40:55.160]  well congressman i know you won't say this because you're a gentleman and very
[40:55.160 --> 40:56.240]  humble
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.560]  we all need to be praying for you because uh... you
[40:59.560 --> 41:02.520]  are are really leading the charge here on something
[41:02.520 --> 41:05.000]  that could bring down this world government
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.200]  that's in its embryonic uh... phases i mean if we audit
[41:08.200 --> 41:11.160]  the u s governorship of the private uh...
[41:11.160 --> 41:13.200]  you know world banking dictatorship
[41:13.200 --> 41:15.840]  uh... if you're able to audit them and all of their
[41:15.840 --> 41:17.080]  crimes come out
[41:17.080 --> 41:18.840]  and they start going to prison
[41:18.840 --> 41:20.840]  their new world order is dead on arrival
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.560]  so what you're doing is so historical and also i would imagine you
[41:24.560 --> 41:25.960]  are smart guy and no
[41:25.960 --> 41:28.560]  very very dangerous
[41:28.560 --> 41:29.240]  you know
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.600]  i guess getting in the car is dangerous too so
[41:33.600 --> 41:36.760]  i try not to dwell too much on that
[41:36.760 --> 41:39.840]  but i mean certainly on record you know i mean on record you know the globalist
[41:39.840 --> 41:41.480]  are dangerous folks
[41:41.480 --> 41:44.680]  oh yeah i mean when uh... when they think uh...
[41:44.680 --> 41:47.920]  when they think you're achieving something i thought the closer we come
[41:47.920 --> 41:51.840]  to achieving i think probably the danger does increase
[41:51.840 --> 41:56.840]  well our prayers are with you sir global warming uh... total fraud did i've
[41:56.840 --> 42:00.280]  seen the studies the majority of scientists say it's a total fraud
[42:00.280 --> 42:03.480]  uh... carbon dioxide part of the life cycle
[42:03.480 --> 42:07.600]  they admit that they want to shut down all the coal plants restrict industry
[42:07.600 --> 42:11.240]  put federal bureaucracy over every facet of life
[42:11.240 --> 42:15.040]  tracker boxes and all the cars the new york times reports obama wants to
[42:15.040 --> 42:16.760]  taxes by the mile
[42:16.760 --> 42:20.280]  uh... they say this is their answer to find all the increased
[42:20.280 --> 42:24.080]  government spending i mean if this sounds like a group soviet takeover
[42:24.080 --> 42:27.160]  you know they're using it if they're excused for
[42:27.160 --> 42:29.440]  even further expansion of the government
[42:29.440 --> 42:32.760]  about a month ago they had and it was not in the middle of winter this was
[42:32.760 --> 42:33.880]  springtime
[42:33.880 --> 42:36.840]  and they had this meeting planned in washington see i don't maybe you did
[42:36.840 --> 42:38.160]  see this in the news
[42:38.160 --> 42:41.200]  uh... for this major meeting on global warming
[42:41.200 --> 42:44.240]  and we had a very late very severe
[42:44.240 --> 42:45.840]  a cold front come through
[42:45.840 --> 42:48.480]  and had to be cancelled because there was ice
[42:48.480 --> 42:51.000]  and snow in washington dc
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.360]  it was sort of a thing that uh... we we chuckled about but uh...
[42:56.360 --> 42:58.600]  i think some of the uh...
[42:58.600 --> 43:03.080]  you know the emissions uh... are you are contributing factor but i also think
[43:03.080 --> 43:05.000]  there's tremendous i have to show that
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.560]  uh... you know the earth gets warm and the world gets cold and we're through
[43:08.560 --> 43:09.760]  cycles and
[43:09.760 --> 43:12.360]  and like you said i think it's pretty strong
[43:12.360 --> 43:15.680]  scientific evidence that these past ten years have not necessarily been all
[43:15.680 --> 43:16.800]  that bad
[43:16.800 --> 43:18.040]  i know here
[43:18.040 --> 43:20.720]  just from our personal experience here in texas
[43:20.720 --> 43:24.760]  in my last couple of winners here been pretty darn chilly i worried about
[43:24.760 --> 43:26.720]  my tomatoes freezing this year
[43:26.720 --> 43:29.120]  so i i just don't think that this is
[43:29.120 --> 43:34.200]  uh... uh... you know uh... done deal i i don't think they can continue to
[43:34.200 --> 43:35.720]  they use this
[43:35.720 --> 43:37.760]  although uh...
[43:37.760 --> 43:40.000]  with sometimes you look at the uh...
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.800]  the news and what's going on on the house floor
[43:42.800 --> 43:45.800]  and they want you to accept it and if you don't then you're some type of a
[43:45.800 --> 43:46.680]  monster
[43:46.680 --> 43:49.320]  that's what i say it's a foregone conclusion
[43:49.320 --> 43:52.200]  congressman i've seen the numbers i know you study the numbers
[43:52.200 --> 43:54.880]  uh... the u n zone reports claim that
[43:54.880 --> 43:58.320]  human kind is contributing to the increase in temperature
[43:58.320 --> 44:02.400]  by three percent the rest is volcanoes in the ocean and
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.080]  uh... you know other creatures that excel carbon dioxide that plants
[44:06.080 --> 44:07.160]  breed
[44:07.160 --> 44:09.400]  and then it turns out the u n zone
[44:09.400 --> 44:11.480]  buoys and weather stations
[44:11.480 --> 44:13.160]  falsified the data
[44:13.160 --> 44:16.200]  to show that there was actually increase there's actually been a decrease
[44:16.200 --> 44:17.520]  because the sun
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.520]  just went into a cooling cycle
[44:21.520 --> 44:23.160]  yeah uh...
[44:23.160 --> 44:26.560]  it's it's pretty amazing just look at uh... how much
[44:26.560 --> 44:31.840]  attention and credibility was given to al gore you know the money made over all
[44:31.840 --> 44:32.960]  that and
[44:32.960 --> 44:35.080]  in people who he gained a lot of
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.360]  he gained a lot of uh... supporters through that
[44:39.360 --> 44:43.040]  hopefully truth will win out in the end and uh... well he trades the carbon
[44:43.040 --> 44:45.920]  credits i mean he owns the big company that does it
[44:45.920 --> 44:47.560]  you know
[44:47.560 --> 44:49.920]  but people don't listen to that
[44:49.920 --> 44:53.600]  some people just buy into that he's he's the only one that's concerned about
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.080]  human kind and and he's going to save us from it
[44:57.080 --> 45:00.760]  okay i got a lot of bullet point questions for you congressman
[45:00.760 --> 45:05.000]  uh... real quick uh... in the fed tell us about that book uh... coming out
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.840]  uh... in september people are really excited about that
[45:07.840 --> 45:12.480]  well it's coming along uh... it should be september uh...
[45:12.480 --> 45:16.040]  about probably about ninety five percent you know they keep sending in
[45:16.040 --> 45:18.240]  things back and saying what about this make
[45:18.240 --> 45:20.000]  clarify this this kind of thing
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.600]  so it's coming along uh... real well
[45:22.600 --> 45:27.280]  i was uh... surprised how quickly they started promoting it so there's been
[45:27.280 --> 45:29.160]  some real promotions and
[45:29.160 --> 45:33.040]  and amazon i guess takes orders and things like that i'd have
[45:33.040 --> 45:37.040]  been a little more comfortable is to see the final thing in in my hand but
[45:37.040 --> 45:38.320]  that's the way they do things
[45:38.320 --> 45:39.800]  but for every reason
[45:39.800 --> 45:40.720]  uh... it
[45:40.720 --> 45:43.720]  uh... that that that i could see it'll be out in september and hopefully a
[45:43.720 --> 45:45.680]  little bit earlier because i was arguing
[45:45.680 --> 45:49.080]  but i have a little bit more time in august and i do in september to
[45:49.080 --> 45:52.520]  go around and talk about it but i don't know if it's
[45:52.520 --> 45:53.480]  for me to go ahead
[45:53.480 --> 45:58.200]  so i go ahead i i i think that uh... i i think it's up it's it's pretty exciting
[45:58.200 --> 46:00.560]  what's happening the attention is getting
[46:00.560 --> 46:02.960]  yeah well this is a manifesto against them
[46:02.960 --> 46:06.800]  criminally to run our country the private bankers so uh... but folks want
[46:06.800 --> 46:08.600]  people to have solutions to take action
[46:08.600 --> 46:11.600]  ron paul's doing i don't know how you do it well i mean i'm i'm writing a book
[46:11.600 --> 46:12.600]  right now
[46:12.600 --> 46:15.480]  uh... i'm making films right now i do the radio show
[46:15.480 --> 46:17.400]  and do the interviews but i know you're on the
[46:17.400 --> 46:19.200]  house for you study the bills
[46:19.200 --> 46:21.680]  you're always informed on the news when i talk to you
[46:21.680 --> 46:23.440]  and i know you do interviews every day
[46:23.440 --> 46:25.680]  i gotta tell you folks ron paul probably works more than me
[46:25.680 --> 46:28.840]  i think he's the only person i know who is more
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.120]  engaged uh... against the new world order with family and everything else i
[46:32.120 --> 46:34.360]  don't know how you do it so we salute you and love you
[46:34.360 --> 46:37.360]  okay a bunch of quick questions now and uh... in the fourteen minutes we've got
[46:37.360 --> 46:38.400]  left
[46:38.400 --> 46:42.360]  everybody keeps emailing me calling and she's just rapidly wanting to know are
[46:42.360 --> 46:45.440]  you gonna run for president twenty twelve
[46:45.440 --> 46:47.360]  well i don't know that answer
[46:47.360 --> 46:49.560]  uh...
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.360]  i would say that if i had to answer now probably not
[46:53.360 --> 46:54.600]  and uh...
[46:54.600 --> 46:58.200]  it it's just uh... it seems like it's a long time off i don't know what the
[46:58.200 --> 47:00.360]  conditions are going to be like uh... so
[47:00.360 --> 47:02.760]  i'm not making plans for that but
[47:02.760 --> 47:04.280]  you know uh...
[47:04.280 --> 47:07.280]  to say that you know exactly what the future will bring it's it's pretty
[47:07.280 --> 47:10.440]  difficult but right now i have no plans to do it
[47:10.440 --> 47:12.280]  okay uh... but
[47:12.280 --> 47:15.680]  things change you were saying that before i didn't run and people saying you'd
[47:15.680 --> 47:16.600]  be
[47:16.600 --> 47:20.680]  you'd be how old you'd be seventy six seventy seven
[47:20.680 --> 47:24.160]  something like that i don't usually think about that too much i think that
[47:24.160 --> 47:27.440]  i i think about how i feel
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.360]  as long as i can be young enough to run i mean i think you're in great shape
[47:31.360 --> 47:34.480]  we need you congressman we need to run for president again
[47:34.480 --> 47:38.600]  as long as i cannot walk my staff up and down the stairs capital that i feel
[47:38.600 --> 47:39.960]  good
[47:39.960 --> 47:42.880]  well that brings me to the next point
[47:42.880 --> 47:46.600]  the media you're in there you're the new darling and i believe this is happening
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.440]  because they know we are that giant third rail
[47:49.440 --> 47:52.160]  the liberty movement is becoming the mainstream
[47:52.160 --> 47:54.640]  uh... and you look at all the polls
[47:54.640 --> 47:58.720]  your views my views others use in the patriot liberty movement we're in line
[47:58.720 --> 47:59.920]  with the people want
[47:59.920 --> 48:01.760]  and so the establishments trying to kind of
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.280]  use you as camouflage or or or you know at least have you on the show some
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.200]  uh... to go look we get it because they risk being made completely obsolete
[48:11.200 --> 48:14.240]  if they don't have you and peter shiffen others on
[48:14.240 --> 48:17.040]  i think something is going on uh...
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.240]  we're not a fifty one percent majority we don't run the republican party we
[48:21.240 --> 48:23.520]  don't run the country and all that
[48:23.520 --> 48:24.680]  but
[48:24.680 --> 48:26.440]  i notice
[48:26.440 --> 48:30.080]  that both republicans and democrats who get into
[48:30.080 --> 48:33.560]  any kind of political trouble where they're gonna have a tough race
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.680]  they're very interested in finding out where our support is
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.600]  so a democrat that might hold a republican seat traditionally republican
[48:42.600 --> 48:43.400]  seat
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.920]  are very interested in talking to me and getting in legislation joining my
[48:47.920 --> 48:50.280]  bills and doing things together
[48:50.280 --> 48:55.160]  so that means that uh... they recognize that our numbers are significant
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.120]  and that uh... are are people are very serious and if they get behind somebody
[49:00.120 --> 49:01.880]  they will support them so
[49:01.880 --> 49:04.160]  no i think it's a very positive sign that
[49:04.160 --> 49:05.520]  and i think when you
[49:05.520 --> 49:07.680]  truly believe in something
[49:07.680 --> 49:12.000]  and you're very principled one individual like that is probably worth a hundred
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.480]  others who are just followers and go along with uh...
[49:15.480 --> 49:20.360]  all what it will you know they put their finger up to the wind and they go and they always want one way or the
[49:20.360 --> 49:21.160]  other
[49:21.160 --> 49:26.520]  so our our supporters are much much more valuable but congressman it's it's but
[49:26.520 --> 49:28.320]  it's more than just a wild card
[49:28.320 --> 49:32.160]  i mean they also see the exponential growth of the liberty movement with you
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.880]  as one of the main uh... not figureheads intellectual leaders of that i mean i mean
[49:36.880 --> 49:40.080]  i would like to get your take on that do you not see the exponential growth is i'm
[49:40.080 --> 49:41.000]  seeing it
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  and i'm tracking it if it continues
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.720]  we are going to be the most dominant force in this country
[49:45.720 --> 49:49.240]  within five years probably sooner because everything you and i and others
[49:49.240 --> 49:51.000]  talked about is now coming true
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.440]  we're being validated
[49:52.440 --> 49:56.840]  yeah i think that's true that's hope that that is uh... is true
[49:56.840 --> 50:00.920]  but also worked on the theory that you never know uh... who's out there who
[50:00.920 --> 50:04.760]  will join us and who's in the remnant the people who were the true believers in
[50:04.760 --> 50:05.800]  haven't had
[50:05.800 --> 50:08.520]  any uh... voice for a long time
[50:08.520 --> 50:12.280]  and those know we're just starting to recognize that those numbers are great and
[50:12.280 --> 50:15.160]  the growth that you're talking about is something that
[50:15.160 --> 50:16.880]  has fascinated me too
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.360]  uh... i have some young people in the other day and
[50:20.360 --> 50:21.800]  and they seem like just
[50:21.800 --> 50:24.120]  teenagers they were teenagers
[50:24.120 --> 50:27.640]  and i think what did you get interested in the campaign all no no i never even
[50:27.640 --> 50:28.600]  looked at the campaign
[50:28.600 --> 50:31.640]  so we're already a year off from the campaign
[50:31.640 --> 50:34.680]  the momentum is there and young people are joining us
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.000]  for the momentum that was built which is really very encouraging
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.040]  absolutely people at first got bummed out when you didn't win
[50:42.040 --> 50:43.480]  and i said wait a minute folks
[50:43.480 --> 50:46.280]  we gained a lot of ground people now know the federal reserve is private
[50:46.280 --> 50:49.640]  and i know about the globalist they now know who the enemy is and with that
[50:49.640 --> 50:50.920]  giant core
[50:50.920 --> 50:53.720]  we can expand to the next level and expand again
[50:53.720 --> 50:54.880]  two more
[50:54.880 --> 50:57.960]  exponential replications we defeat the new world order
[50:57.960 --> 51:00.920]  we are inches away from victory thanks to ron paul and others
[51:00.920 --> 51:05.080]  attention gardeners this is an urgent gc and self-reliance update gc and has
[51:05.080 --> 51:08.600]  just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and
[51:08.600 --> 51:11.960]  herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant
[51:11.960 --> 51:15.000]  growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.080]  practically any soil and like conditions
[51:17.080 --> 51:20.200]  now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance
[51:20.200 --> 51:23.800]  proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and
[51:23.800 --> 51:27.560]  dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum
[51:27.560 --> 51:30.680]  time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[51:30.680 --> 51:33.640]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[51:33.640 --> 51:36.360]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables
[51:36.360 --> 51:39.400]  with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value
[51:39.400 --> 51:43.000]  and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can

[54:20.520 --> 54:23.160]  okay we got about five minutes left with the congressman he's got to go we're
[54:23.160 --> 54:26.680]  very thankful for his time once a month when he visits with us
[54:26.680 --> 54:32.520]  congressman is the obama juggernaut starting to slow that's what i see
[54:32.520 --> 54:36.040]  happening when he has these outrageous lies about i won't hire any lobbyist
[54:36.040 --> 54:39.320]  and that's all he hires or i'm giving rights to detainees and then signs and
[54:39.320 --> 54:41.960]  orders saying no geneva convention no habeas corpus
[54:41.960 --> 54:47.160]  i mean where do you see this going with the president
[54:47.160 --> 54:52.360]  i think so far i wish i was as optimistic as you are about this i still
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.520]  think he's flying high i think he's very still very popular
[54:56.520 --> 55:02.360]  and it's almost like they used to say about reagan he was he had teflon on me
[55:02.360 --> 55:05.160]  was the teflon president this guy's teflon too
[55:05.160 --> 55:09.240]  and he can do this and logical people may be questioning this
[55:09.240 --> 55:12.920]  but uh no i think there's i sense there's a few in
[55:12.920 --> 55:17.800]  in the congress who are the real principled progressive democrats who
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.480]  are very strongly anti-war they see through some of this
[55:21.480 --> 55:26.360]  but uh even even if the people are so upset and they're upset with the
[55:26.360 --> 55:28.440]  congress and the economy and everything else
[55:28.440 --> 55:33.560]  so far he's not getting much blame but i think uh as time goes on the more he
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.080]  does this uh the more credibility he'll lose
[55:37.080 --> 55:40.920]  uh so it's it's a big i guess the real test will come on this
[55:40.920 --> 55:44.680]  will be uh next year you know next year's elections those
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.560]  uh the first uh uh congressional election after president selected is is the
[55:49.560 --> 55:53.080]  big test well congressman look how he comes out and says i'm getting rid of
[55:53.080 --> 55:56.920]  the real id act and then i read what napolitano said it says
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.760]  we're still going to have federalized state ids the feds will just pay for it
[56:00.760 --> 56:05.160]  now same thing yeah yeah there's no doubt you know he says
[56:05.160 --> 56:09.400]  he closes down guantanamo uh well it's not quite closed down yet
[56:09.400 --> 56:13.400]  but he hasn't rejected rendition sending him off and hiring some thugs in other
[56:13.400 --> 56:18.200]  countries uh to do the dirty work uh so and he he is a strong
[56:18.200 --> 56:22.920]  believer in uh the state secrecy you know on all those court cases
[56:22.920 --> 56:25.800]  uh they had they're taking bush's position on that they
[56:25.800 --> 56:30.120]  they want to protect the state and even if they it seems like even if they
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.920]  did believe one one way uh or at least they say that in their campaigns once
[56:34.920 --> 56:38.920]  they're in power it's the protection and the enhancement of power
[56:38.920 --> 56:42.120]  of the executive branch that always seems to be the case
[56:42.120 --> 56:47.160]  but i put more blame on the congress for this happening because
[56:47.160 --> 56:50.120]  we still have the responsibility the authority
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.800]  we have the purse strings and we ought not to let them get away with this
[56:53.800 --> 56:57.960]  absolutely music we've been taught too long that we need a strong president
[56:57.960 --> 57:01.800]  that's what absolutely congressman last question here and this is key
[57:01.800 --> 57:06.600]  i've got the boston globe combat support battalion deployed to maintain order
[57:06.600 --> 57:10.120]  boston marathon i've got the tennessee governor two weeks ago if you're not
[57:10.120 --> 57:13.320]  aware of this i'll send it to you saying you can't run warrantless army
[57:13.320 --> 57:16.920]  checkpoints on citizens they did it anyways uh i'm you know we're the
[57:16.920 --> 57:20.520]  folks who broke the mic report in the federal report and all these reports
[57:20.520 --> 57:23.480]  people couldn't believe it when we first broke them where the patriots are
[57:23.480 --> 57:26.280]  terrorists and the people buying guns or terrorists and the veterans are
[57:26.280 --> 57:29.960]  terrorists can you speak to that now sir and these top-off
[57:29.960 --> 57:33.160]  drills they're doing where they do practice putting us in sports stadiums
[57:33.160 --> 57:36.760]  just overall the reports the troops all of it
[57:36.760 --> 57:40.760]  well i don't know the details as well as you do but i know it's going on and i
[57:40.760 --> 57:44.360]  know they use these as excuses and it's always to build up
[57:44.360 --> 57:47.640]  fear and when you get to people fearful then they're more likely to give up
[57:47.640 --> 57:51.000]  their liberties whether it's following a 9-11 incident or the
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.600]  potential uh saddam Hussein that might have a nuclear
[57:54.600 --> 57:57.320]  weapon and all that stuff so they build up the fear
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.480]  and these events you know they'll make use of them and they'll come in and say
[58:01.480 --> 58:05.240]  look this there might be somebody there that's going to blow this thing up
[58:05.240 --> 58:08.360]  uh that just means that our job is that much
[58:08.360 --> 58:12.440]  harder to do and waking up the people and making them realize that you shouldn't
[58:12.440 --> 58:16.440]  sacrifice your liberty you're never safer by sacrificing liberty

[1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:26.680]  i think that was the most jam-packed 30 minute interview i've ever done with
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:29.880]  ron paul i probably interviewed the guy
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:36.280]  i've been interviewing him since 1996 probably interviewing about 10-12
[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:40.360]  times a year that's a lot of interviews hundreds of
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:43.800]  times i think that one was power-packed there's
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:47.800]  probably five or six big news stories just out of that interview right there
[1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:51.320]  um yeah they're definitely getting ready to hit uh pakistan i mean they're
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:55.640]  they've got the safety off they got the gun pointed at pakistan
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:58.040]  they're now claiming the pakistani government's working with al-qaeda and
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:01.400]  the taliban when it's actually al-qaeda and taliban bombing and trying to
[1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:04.360]  overthrow the government right now because they work for the globalist
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:07.880]  of course they take blow up the serbs they go after the iraqis
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:12.360]  they go for the iranians and then their mommy the u.s government
[1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:16.200]  constantly says they're about to get us um yeah the globalist radicalized the
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:20.040]  muslims hitler did it first and then it was continued by the west
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.160]  and then now i was i forgot about that i was watching fox this morning on jogging
[1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:27.320]  on the treadmill and they've got the former cia head of counterterrorism
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:30.200]  going oh yeah they've probably got a with no evidence
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:35.080]  reporter didn't press him none of it and that one babyface reporter on there
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:38.520]  used to be on cnn and you know with that fake smile he went oh thank you for
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:43.240]  the information yeah we think they've got a nuke the taliban's got a nuke and
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:47.320]  so we got to go in there they've stolen a nuke from pakistan
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:51.080]  no evidence just lying that now they just don't say
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:54.360]  sonam's got big wmd factory so that was made up
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:57.400]  with the specters all over the country under you in control now they just say
[1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:00.760]  oh yeah there's some nukes floating around and the fact that they're putting
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.920]  that out may mean they may vaporize the u.s city and say the kibler elves did it
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:07.880]  and then this whole police state they've built for the american people they
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:11.960]  claim was for al-qaeda yet the jaws of that bear trap
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.480]  closed on us for the next hour bob Chapman is with us
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:19.080]  we're going to cover the economic news in this segment the next i'm going to
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:23.000]  sit here and try to shut up and have bob go over christler gm ford
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.280]  saying they may go into bankruptcy uh what's happening with the banks the
[1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:30.520]  latest news why gold's going up and then we're taking nothing but your phone
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.280]  calls with bob Chapman and then into the third hour fourth hour
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:38.520]  nothing but phone calls and news today big breaking news
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:41.560]  we've got here ourselves with government documents and things that i've got
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:43.720]  to read over during the breaks and double check some things to make some
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:46.520]  phone calls some big news we're going to be breaking probably
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:50.760]  a lot of other stuff going on exciting the movement of liberties exploding and
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:54.760]  growing and ron paul agrees the x caliber of the silver bullet
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:58.520]  is auditing the fed their total criminals we know they've committed crimes
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:01.720]  and then the arrest can start and you heard him he says no they're dangerous
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:05.800]  they will make moves they'll set off nukes they'll start wars but if we've
[1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:09.320]  inoculated everybody psychologically that that they'll do that
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.920]  when they make that move that'll only backfire worse in their face
[1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:17.560]  this is like three-dimensional chess folks okay and and you got to really get
[1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:21.240]  into game theory and history and how the enemy operates and their mo and
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:24.520]  their psychology and what they're going to do and past operations and they'll
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  throw curveballs but they'll throw curveballs out of a certain spectrum
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:31.960]  of operations they've done in the past so you've got to always be integrating
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:35.320]  that information into the full spectrum analysis
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:37.960]  to understand what's going to happen and the number one thing you got to have
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:41.480]  is courage courage to be in prison courage to be killed
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:45.800]  courage to be destroyed in the media the truth is though it's the big boys like
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:48.360]  myself and bob Chapman and ron paul and many others that
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:51.880]  are on the tip of the spear here you don't have anything to fear except
[1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:53.880]  standing up and speaking out and getting involved
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:58.520]  that's where the danger is for you last night though i was sitting there
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:02.680]  researching at about midnight and it just it just hit me like a ton of bricks it
[1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:06.360]  hits me sometimes not fear just man you go on the air and you expose how they
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:10.040]  ship in the air when it cocaine they don't like that
[1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:13.080]  man you expose other putting cancer viruses in the vaccines to bring in the
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:17.000]  one-child policy in eugenics man you're exposing the eugenics wars
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.920]  they don't like that you're changing paradigms with your army of great
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:23.720]  listeners and activists you know what's happening
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:26.200]  and then it just it just it was heartening though i said that you know

[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:43.640]  i just thank god every day i just thank god every day that i didn't go over to
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:46.040]  the dark side let's go to somebody else who's fighting
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.880]  the dark side bob shatman ran the biggest gold and silver private broker
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:53.480]  firm in the world was in military intelligence before that had the
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:56.360]  largest newsletter until the nineties when he
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:59.640]  retired he came back out of retirement it's one of the biggest again

[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:07.800]  which he had were griffin and with gary allen and others putting out books and
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:10.360]  publications he helped finance and put out
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:14.680]  none dare call a conspiracy the book that woke me up
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:16.840]  already had a lot of pieces of the puzzle but i guess i've read when i was
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:20.120]  about 13 14 and so we really always love having bob
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:23.400]  shatman on this one take a lot of calls today bob which i know you always like to
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.400]  do that's coming up in the next segment
[1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:30.520]  so much is going on uh... but uh... what is most important on the economic
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:33.480]  front right now bob
[1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:36.520]  well there's a number of things but i want to make a comment to what you were
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:39.960]  talking to run paul about at the very end
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:44.200]  and that was this uh... suppose that pakistan uh... has uh...
[1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:51.880]  taliban has a newt uh... i have a direct line into the ranger outfit
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:57.320]  that's guarding the nuclear facilities in pakistan
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:02.920]  and you know if they had gone into those facilities in any way we know about it
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:07.960]  it's ridiculous what pakistan's got 1520 newts and they're all
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:12.040]  there's 1520 newts max in pakistan they're totally guarded
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:14.760]  the u.s government labs helped a q con build them
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:18.520]  let me explain how assinine it is to go on fox for people
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:23.640]  and and and say the taliban stolen nuke out of a base
[1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:27.320]  well i don't think that there's anything they could steal
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:32.120]  uh... because they're not at bases and uh... uh... if they if they have one they
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:35.160]  had to have gotten it from someplace else
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:39.640]  and i don't think china or russia or anybody else england uh... france i
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:43.000]  don't think they're about to give them a nuclear device so
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:49.080]  uh... it's all poppycock it really is ridiculous it is dreadful the way
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:53.720]  that they come out on these major news media outlets
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:58.760]  and don't tell the truth
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:02.760]  oh and anyway the big news now
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:06.760]  is uh... in the news of course the stock market's up
[1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:10.040]  uh... because uh... the the worst the news gets the
[1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:14.200]  more the market is up and it's up a hundred thirty two points today
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:17.880]  but it will go back down again believe me um... the big news
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:23.400]  uh... number one uh... by june first general modus will probably be out of
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:27.640]  business uh... christ will probably be out of
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:30.680]  business next week yeah let me just throw this in and i want to get your
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:32.520]  take on it because i forgot to make this point
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:36.120]  i was watching fox singing and all the channels is kind of scanning today
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:40.280]  and i was scanning radio driving into work and they were saying on there
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:44.120]  like it was a good thing they're going to chop christler and gm up in lots of
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:47.720]  little pieces instead of that infrastructure being national
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:50.920]  security with all the money that you're gonna have socialism
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:53.320]  that should be kept there no they're saying they're going to just
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:56.600]  sell it off to foreigners including the head of fiat
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:00.120]  who's one of the co-chairs of bill deberg go ahead
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:04.120]  that you're absolutely right about that and uh... they've been deeply involved
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:07.560]  in bill deberg it's an alumnus company
[1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:14.120]  fiat um... and so uh... they're talking about christler going down next week
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:17.160]  uh... i think ford uh... will make it
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.880]  uh... i think one of the reasons why
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:24.840]  is that they uh... they cleaned inventory in in a
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:29.320]  in a very logical and simple way uh... what they've been doing with their
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:33.080]  excess vehicles is shipping them out of the country
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:38.440]  and they're selling them uh... at employee cost
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:42.360]  that's what they call it but you know you can buy a thirty two thousand dollar
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:45.560]  vehicle for twenty five thousand dollars
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:49.320]  if you live in uh... italy or
[1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:55.320]  mexico or or chile or wherever and they've been discounting
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:59.080]  oh i guess for about probably six months now
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:02.200]  and so they've cleaned up their inventory they're not making a lot of money but
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:05.800]  they're making a little money but they're not sitting on the inventory of cars
[1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:11.080]  that others are and i think it's really helped them i was very very smart
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:14.200]  instead of getting into this well we'll give you sixty months and
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:18.360]  well they also didn't take the bailout money and actually spent family money
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:20.840]  other things that's still on a large share
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:24.200]  knowing that the feds were going to come in and take control afford they said
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:26.920]  that what five months ago
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:30.200]  that's correct that's correct and uh...
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:33.560]  so anyway i think i think they got a shot at it it's it's not going to be any
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:36.120]  piece of cake they may need help too
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:38.760]  uh... but i i think that they'll stay in business
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:41.880]  and i'm happy about that at least one of them will survive
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:46.920]  uh... chrysler was a smaller company and general motors is really the one that
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:51.640]  hurts employment wise and and structurally for america
[1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:55.960]  and uh... and this is all the result
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:14:00.040]  and the problems we're having in the economy are all the result
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:03.720]  of free trade globalization offsharing and outsourcing
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:07.320]  this is where it all comes from anyway the second
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:13.480]  large item today is the uh...
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:17.480]  the uh... statements made by the ceo
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:21.560]  of bank of america which now owns merrill inch
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:29.080]  uh... he said that he was told when he wanted to kill a merrill
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:32.840]  inch deal that he had to make the deal
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:36.600]  and uh... he was told that by mr paulson
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:40.840]  who was told to say that by mr bernand k
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:45.240]  so we have a private organization telling people what to do in america
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:50.360]  and um i'm sure they told him that if he didn't do what they told him to do
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:53.400]  his life would be one long misery after that
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:56.840]  and of course paulson is on record now
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:15:00.600]  of having said that to him and um...
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:05.560]  and it also included the bonuses he was he didn't want to do the bonuses after
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:09.000]  the uh... the deal was done with merrill
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.840]  and uh... they said you better do them
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:16.600]  or we're gonna fire the board and you too and so
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:24.360]  he wanted to keep his job so he lied this is louis the head of bank of america
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:30.520]  and he broke the law and he screwed the shareholders
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:33.320]  who didn't know that these things were going on
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:37.640]  and uh... mr bernand k uh... and mr paulson
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:41.880]  have both stepped over the line they broke broken the law
[1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:47.000]  now whether that means anything or not in our our our life in washington today
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.760]  remains to be seen i mean they get these two guys from
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:55.160]  uh... a pack who are supposed to go on trial and they're talking about not
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:59.320]  trying them i mean the whole thing is upside down
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:02.120]  so in washington they do anything they feel like doing
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:05.400]  so they probably won't do anything about these people breaking the law and
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:08.360]  in fact that's another fact that they've done it
[1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:12.280]  go ahead the very fact that they've done it the lying
[1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:16.360]  the perpetual lying and duplicity and deceit
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:21.320]  i mean these people are totally without compunction they're totally evil
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:24.280]  well that was my next question i want to get back into
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.040]  Pelosi and this other congresswoman and bragging that
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:32.440]  oh we'll cover up israeli spies uh... and then on top of that you have
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:34.920]  geithner saying i don't have to pay taxes
[1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:38.440]  i'll just run the treasury department in the past if you had any tax trouble
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:43.240]  you couldn't be a male boy uh... you know at a treasury facility in any
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:46.280]  connection or if your company had any tax problems you couldn't do
[1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:51.320]  business you couldn't supply you know uh... water cooler water coffee for them
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:55.640]  and now it's just it literally is going to seed
[1:16:55.640 --> 1:17:00.920]  and then iran grabs the spy i'm not defending iran folks okay
[1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:04.360]  you know the whole issue is this is reality she confesses they have one of
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:08.760]  their little semi you know uh... legalese courts
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:11.720]  and they say how dare you we need to invade iran
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:14.440]  you're being mean to her your courts aren't real
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:18.680]  while they torture people for seven years and then roll it out as evidence
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:23.320]  and say that they can grab u.s citizens under the military commissions act
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:27.080]  and any enemy combatant designation that we have no rights so
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:31.640]  so when we torture it's good but when they just try someone for spying and
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:35.800]  then meanwhile bob the white house going back for years
[1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:38.280]  and it's been all of the news as you know but for those that haven't checked
[1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:41.800]  they admit they're using wahhabi asunis to attack iran
[1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:45.000]  and stage terror attacks inside the country
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.320]  that's admitted mainstream news so they admit their spies israel announced
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:51.960]  they've got spies and destabilization operations
[1:17:51.960 --> 1:17:55.960]  in iran it's all admitted they're assassinating people
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:18:00.760]  it's on record they grab a spy and our media says it's impossible there's no
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:04.520]  such thing as spies oh they're horrible i mean the propaganda is so
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:12.040]  brutish go ahead well i think they again reached this point of arrogance that
[1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:15.960]  they don't care but they've got military operations going on
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:19.560]  inside of iran both israel and the united states have been going on for a
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:24.120]  long time and it's wrong and you're right about what you say
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:27.720]  and here they're making an issue out of somebody get caught spying
[1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:31.400]  well they do it all the time they've done it for years
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.000]  a i d for years and years has been a cia front
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.040]  and there's been many others you know and they they set up one corporation do
[1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:43.560]  this buying and then shut it down and then start another
[1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:46.840]  corporation by the way folks they don't care about this woman
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:50.920]  you might want to explain to them bob if you're a spy and really get caught like
[1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:53.640]  in cambodia or vietnam or korea or russia
[1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:58.280]  they just writes you off stalling grab 20 something thousand u.s troops out of
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:04.360]  nazi camps a p o w's in british and just and and and they just gave them to them
[1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:08.760]  they just gave us on record that's what they think of you military police
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:12.680]  intelligence bob well you're absolutely right and
[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:16.920]  of course what isan howard did in opera operation keelhaul
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:21.800]  at the end of the wall was unspeakable i mean one human being shouldn't ever do
[1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:26.120]  that to another like torture and what isan howard did was
[1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:31.880]  he turned over a couple of million ukrainian troops and families
[1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:35.800]  to the russians who had been fighting against rusher in the east and front
[1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:39.000]  and they put him on the valley and just trying the artillery on him and blown
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.840]  the pieces and so you know this is the kind of thing
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:47.400]  that really upset paten and that's why the cia murdered paten
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:51.080]  and that's now ending and that's now been declassified by the way
[1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:54.840]  we've always known that but now we know how they killed him dead in a hammer but

[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:16.680]  haven't really been paying attention to it at all but

[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:23.960]  is that i've been very interesting uh one of which
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:28.520]  a good friend of mine his father is actually uh a police officer in the
[1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:34.440]  town of matt and he told me that they a federal
[1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:39.400]  agent came in the it came in the um
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:43.720]  he came in the uh what do you call it the building whatever he works at
[1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:48.360]  and told them that i'll get this year that the federal the federal government
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:52.120]  is going to take over their uh their own precinct or whatever
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:55.160]  that they worked at did that sound like it's anything
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:59.640]  does that sound fishy at all it's it's called total federalization
[1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:04.200]  martial law tyranny to do that uh let me go ahead and just give you a
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:08.920]  headline you know i talk about all this news let me go ahead and just
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:13.480]  find this for you this is out of the atlanta journal
[1:26:13.480 --> 1:26:17.240]  constitution uh and that it's also in the
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:22.120]  arizona republic guys put this up on screen dps
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:29.400]  us marshals merge is the headline dps us marshals merge
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:33.480]  and then it says the state police and federal marshals are merging
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:37.240]  their special units that track arizona fugitives in a move
[1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:41.080]  they say will save money they said they're going to get rid of sheriffs too
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:44.840]  the growing number of arrests warrants being issued and it says that the state
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:48.360]  police will now be under the feds uh that uh
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:52.600]  that they're going to be in the same office same meetings uh bob this this
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:56.680]  is it it's really happening it's a federalization
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:27:02.440]  of all of the enforcement agencies to come out of the federal government and
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:06.200]  it's going to lead to no good end because it's not going to work and the
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:11.000]  people are going to be very upset about it well uh bomb i know you've seen these
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.280]  articles but every couple days now i see it uh
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:18.440]  from news reports all over the country and we've got that up on screen for some
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:22.200]  reason the computer has got it in a selection area where it's selecting
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:25.160]  favorites so let's put that up on prison planet on tv without that yeah
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:28.600]  dps us marshals merge but of course it's for a good reason track fugitives you're
[1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:31.400]  not for the fugitives and oh the marines are running checkpoints to stop drunk
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:35.080]  drivers and searching us citizens with side arms on their side but it's to
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:37.880]  stop drunk you're not for drugs are you and all you have was a mass shooting in
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:40.760]  the army popped up you know to run checkpoints but you're not for mass
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:43.960]  shooters are you this is how they're all they're there to checkpoint where there
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:47.320]  was a car wreck all you're for the army helping folks in a car wreck
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:51.320]  this is how they're selling it uh but to have the governor two weeks ago saying
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:55.080]  no checkpoints with regular army in tennessee and they went ahead and just
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:59.640]  did it i mean bob then i get all the reports where they say oh we have local
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:04.520]  liaison officers from army intelligence that are in our department helping us
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:09.080]  now i mean and then oh the local austin
[1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:14.040]  uh... green core that will put the new carbon taxes in on a city-wide basis
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:17.080]  it's run by all these former army intelligence guys
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:20.920]  and they say in the paper we're here seeing this as a mission
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:25.480]  as running an intelligence operation i mean they're they're now admitting it
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:31.000]  bob go ahead well i think uh... it certainly out of the venue of the
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.840]  federal government to be doing that and we all know that
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:39.080]  uh... and uh... they're going to continue to do what they wanted to
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:42.440]  uh... there's going to be confrontation sooner or later
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:46.920]  and uh... it's not going to be nice now people encounter intelligence
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:51.800]  though generally uh... are in training intelligence not
[1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:56.360]  uh... counter espionage activities in some small town
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:01.560]  uh... in alabama or georgia or are or arizona uh... that that's not their
[1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:05.320]  functioning they they function in a different area
[1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:08.680]  and i think that they perhaps are giving these people jobs after their
[1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:10.320]  retire
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:12.080]  you have it bob imagine

[1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:45.080]  some a situation in alabama we're talking to
[1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:50.760]  matthew so so recap uh basically the feds come in they say to
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:54.040]  one of your relations that we're going to be taking over in august tell folks
[1:33:54.040 --> 1:33:58.520]  about that okay i have a good friend of mine his
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:03.000]  father is a uh a police officer in the town of mat
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:08.600]  and he was telling me a story of how a federal agent came in and talked to the
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:12.840]  chief uh at the precinct and was telling them
[1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:17.560]  that starting in august this year that they that they're uh
[1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:20.840]  precinct is going to be under control of the federal government
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:25.320]  i told he was telling me about this and i was kind of freaking out about it but
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:31.160]  to add more to this story uh if anyone has seen anything about these amaro
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:36.680]  coins going out here at all i work in a retail store
[1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:41.320]  and someone tried to sell use that as money because it is
[1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:44.360]  like at first glance looks like a gold dollar
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:47.800]  and then i looked at it more and it says you end up north america
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:52.120]  so i told the guy look i just give him a dollar and get it if he didn't mind and
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:55.800]  he pretty much i could tell he didn't didn't even know what it was
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:59.960]  and i took it the police officer and i showed my friend's dad and i showed it
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:04.040]  to him and he was uh very confused about this and
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:07.160]  he's actually trying to look in it right now until i find out all over the
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:10.680]  internet now that these amaro coins are supposed to be
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:15.080]  supposedly um some like supposed to be used in the future
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:19.160]  and uh i'm telling my parents and like my family about all this and my dad
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:23.960]  believes every bit of it my mom you know she like everyone they're all
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:27.560]  everyone's kind of all over the place but the one thing that i'm calling in the
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:31.480]  most of that i wanted you to know alex and i want everyone to know out there
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:34.760]  is is there any possible way i can upload this
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:38.280]  video so that y'all can see this because
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:41.640]  uh yeah if i'm sure you've probably heard about the uh
[1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:45.160]  what the other link to this that pretty much is woken me up and made me realize
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:49.320]  that oh lord things are going on that i'm not even aware of in this world
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:52.440]  is you know the whole coffin thing right now
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:58.520]  uh i put in i found someone on youtube put in a quadrant where you can find
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:01.560]  all of the coffins that are set around the entire
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:06.840]  the entire country and one is out in opalac in alabama which isn't but like
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:09.720]  a 30 to 45 minute drive for me well you got to watch that
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:13.480]  they're established sir the establishment puts out fake maps
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:17.880]  fake camps so they can then go debunk it but yes we were sent photos we do know
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:21.000]  where some are in alabama they are plastic yeah but there's
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.760]  but there's something different to this though because i took a video camera
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:28.920]  with me earlier this week on a day off and i was actually going to make a video
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:32.600]  of how i thought this stuff was fake and i was going to show up there because uh
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:36.360]  because they heard the quadrant i have i printed off that printed off the um
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:39.480]  the uh directions there and i thought it was going to be fake and when i showed
[1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:42.200]  up i was freaking out because they were actually there
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:45.960]  and i got out and i went to go and i took some photos of this
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:50.040]  and there's some different things to these coffins that other people have
[1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:53.720]  not seen on the uh other videos on youtube
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:57.000]  okay are you saying let me stop you let me stop you because
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:00.200]  what happens is we take a call and it goes for an hour and then no callers get

[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:24.680]  no yeah well what i mean is is i don't i've looked on info wars and i didn't see
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:28.360]  any forums or anything like that where i could go and upload videos or something
[1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:31.080]  like that no no just upload it to youtube we'll link
[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:34.680]  to it and just write in the description where you saw it and
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:37.720]  what happened but i believe we already have photos of that alabama facility
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:41.000]  it's in the middle of a clearing in the woods right
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.880]  yeah but has anyone put up that each one of these markers i i got out of my car
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:49.400]  and i walked over real quickly trying to make sure no one was looking because i
[1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:53.320]  was kind of freaking out i'll be honest it's okay as if anyone if anyone hasn't
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:56.520]  noticed all of these coffins have markers on them
[1:37:56.520 --> 1:37:59.320]  they're all uh they're either yellow and they're
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:01.880]  above from the ones i saw were yellow and blue
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:06.360]  and i actually went inside the facility that that was near near there
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:12.200]  and they have spray painted they have spray painted the dates each time that
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:16.520]  they come back and put another upload of coffin

[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:24.200]  but the but uh look yes this is for the cdc during mass plagues
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:27.080]  that they will probably release themselves which they've been caught doing
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:30.840]  before that's why we say they've got the mo they do it they're into killing us
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:34.440]  they're into eugenics listen uh we'll put you on hold give me your name and

[1:38:47.400 --> 1:38:50.680]  bob shatman i try to go through a lot of calls but every call seems to be
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:54.200]  you know like that and most of them pan out to be accurate calls
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:39:01.560]  uh you know legitimate pretty wild stuff huh
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:05.640]  it is amazing bob uh you ready to take another call it's wonderful that these
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:08.600]  people are bringing the information and it's just like
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:13.480]  uh you experience the same thing i do all day long all night long from all
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:17.160]  over the world i'm getting articles and videos and
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:21.320]  and all kinds of stuff that i would have never gotten otherwise i i can't
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:26.280]  research everything and it's it's like the world out there
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:30.520]  there are enough people that are on a bombing mission sending me this stuff
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:33.880]  and i'm sure you're getting it like that as well
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:37.800]  and you know i run it twice a week and you run it on the program
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:43.560]  and i think it's fantastic what i can't stand because i wish none of this was
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:47.000]  true i mean i want to have just a good life and enjoy
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:51.560]  myself but it 99 percent of the time what they're calling in with
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:55.160]  ends up being true
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:58.920]  i mean you know that's what keeps freaking me out is that
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:02.120]  i've already been sent by a truck driver the information i'm already
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:06.280]  describing when he's seen in alabama and he's gone and gotten even more
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:10.120]  and it's just at some point it just it's amazing
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:15.160]  let's take another call here let's talk to uh scott in illinois go ahead scott
[1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:18.600]  yeah alex i finally found something to disagree with you on but it's a mistake
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:23.560]  that a lot of people make for my understanding 1776 the tea party
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:28.040]  was not about taxation without representation it was about the east
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.840]  india company being allowed to bring in cheap
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:35.240]  tea and thereby eliminating the local market for tea
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:42.680]  so it'd be more about globalization not about taxation without representation
[1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:47.160]  it was about a whole bunch of stuff but they chose the tea
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:51.880]  because of the tea tax yeah because the east indian company was being allowed
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:55.720]  to ship in tea without paying that tax and way cheap
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:58.920]  where it would undercut everybody in the local market
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:02.840]  so it was corruption by the globalist and yep
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:06.360]  that same imperial model where they would use mercantilism
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:10.120]  to deindustrialize or keep certain nations unindustrialized
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:13.960]  while keeping the center of the empire being the only place with machine tooling
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:18.840]  and that had everything bob you want to break down mercantilism
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:23.880]  well very simply it's what we see today is free trade and globalization
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:27.560]  and they move in and they corner a market
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:32.360]  and produce and bring the goods throughout the world
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:36.520]  undercutting everybody uh the united states when they first
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:42.840]  started between 1790 and 1800 they had free trade
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:48.040]  and it just about destroyed the country and because of british mercantilism
[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:52.040]  and they would be shipping all kinds of stuff that they were making say in
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:54.840]  china into the united states and of course
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:59.480]  they couldn't compete they had a higher standard of wages etc
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:04.200]  just like they are now and that was abandoned and that
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:09.640]  began the beginnings of the tariffs that were put on goods for all those years
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:13.560]  up until 1962 when they started to phase them out
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:19.560]  and even more so in 1986 when GATT's name was changed from
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:23.720]  the general accounting trades and tariffs or whatever it was
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:29.080]  to the world trade organization and you know all you have to do is like you
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:33.800]  have alex and i go back in history spot mercantilism
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:37.560]  and bring it into the current day and that's that's exactly what they do they
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:41.560]  do in the same thing over again and only this time
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:46.120]  i believe the the impetus behind it is not only profit
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:50.760]  but the destruction of the economies of the united states canada and west in
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:54.680]  europe because they are the strongest financially and economically in the
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:42:58.680]  world and if they go down economically and
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:01.720]  financially the rest of the world will go down with them
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.240]  and then people will be in a position these
[1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:08.840]  illuminous hope that they'll be forced to accept
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:14.680]  world domination in world government and the policies of one-child policies
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:18.040]  and control that the globalist all hold near and dear i
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:23.080]  concur in the uh... imf is shortling going oh it's too bad
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:26.360]  90 more million people will go into deep poverty
[1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:29.720]  from just being poor middle class oh we're so upset
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.440]  when their own internal documents that have been linked
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:35.640]  uh... that have been leaked out that we've covered here
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:39.880]  are admitting their engineering all of this waging war explain to people bob
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:45.880]  why the true elites of the planet want everybody poor under them
[1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:49.480]  well it's a slave society it's as simple as that now you go back to the
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:53.080]  pharaohs are are any of the kings and dictators of
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:57.080]  through time you'll find that that's the way they like things
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:01.160]  people suppressed and i you know i i i it's so
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:04.760]  sociopathic and we get plenty of sociopaths
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:08.280]  in our own societies throughout the world today
[1:44:08.280 --> 1:44:11.720]  and uh... they happen to be people who believe in world government for the
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:15.960]  most part but they want a finite number of people
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:20.360]  on the earth to do the all the jobs and they're going to tell them what to do
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:24.440]  because they know better what's better for them than they do
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.240]  and so uh... that's what they're up to
[1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:30.360]  that's right ted turner says we should only be allowed to have one child and
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:32.360]  then have a license to do it
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:35.480]  and but at the same time he had five children
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:40.440]  owns dozens of houses literally dozens of yachts and airplanes
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:44.040]  and when he's been asked about that he says well i'm different
[1:44:44.040 --> 1:44:47.240]  so see he says i'm honest now he needs to go
[1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:51.480]  you know commit suicide if you have i'm supposedly need to go kill myself
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:53.960]  he needs to go first him first
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:57.080]  you know the stupid little mustache and all of his baloney
[1:44:57.080 --> 1:45:00.920]  he's got up and given speeches at the press club calling his useless feeders
[1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:05.160]  hitler quotes any he funds the vaccines for little black kids because he
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:07.920]  cares about him so much i mean come on folks
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:09.720]  these people are sickening
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:13.600]  disgusting degenerates and the enemies of free humanity
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:15.000]  they don't think of themselves
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:19.480]  connected to the rest of humanity or the goals or space exploration or
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:21.480]  or or or future generations
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:25.400]  don't care about their own kids they're all about themselves now
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:29.080]  they are the most greedy self-serving control freak people out there
[1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:33.480]  and we've got arrest control of the system from them don't we bob
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:36.600]  we absolutely have to otherwise we're going to be living
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:40.680]  on our knees for the rest of our lives and for generations
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:44.680]  come they will be subjected they the people of the earth
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:48.120]  whoever they may be are going to be subjected to this
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:51.480]  and fifty to ninety percent of the people
[1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:52.920]  on the earth today
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:56.680]  will not be here in the future because they don't want them around
[1:45:56.680 --> 1:45:58.840]  and they're on record constantly saying it
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:02.120]  i think we should uh... forcibly abort the children by the way i care about
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:04.920]  black kids i have a free shot i want to get them
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:08.920]  no wonder why your country in africa has forty six percent hiv infection
[1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:12.200]  oh i don't know hi i'm ted turner i care about you
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:16.600]  please please i i'm a eugenicist and all bill gates my friend whose dad
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:19.080]  is in no new genesis and heads up plan parenthood
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:22.120]  and constantly talks about too many people he's got shots for you
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:27.000]  oh you can't put two together can you i mean you know come on people
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:30.440]  what does it take bob but there's that horror level
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:33.400]  people can't admit this to themselves can they
[1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:37.480]  it's too diabolical for the average human mind to
[1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:41.160]  contemplate in the only thing that rolls them around is
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:44.520]  you know when they snatch one of the kids and put a bullet in his head
[1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:47.800]  or that they see all this horrible war going on
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:51.720]  in their backyard or when there's no food to eat
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:55.480]  or when the house has been foreclosed the vehicles taken
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:46:58.920]  and they lost their job and they're living under a bridge this is what it
[1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:04.040]  gets it has to happen for people most of the people in society to move
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:08.280]  look at they will move as soon as their belly's empty
[1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:11.480]  but the globalists will do that at their time to hurt all the empty belly
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:14.280]  people against the middle class calling them the elite so we've got to be
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:17.640]  ready for that it's very simple it'll take all
[1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:21.080]  call it'll take all forms before we get there
[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:24.760]  and you know what we have to look is at the mission
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:29.400]  and what is at the end of what we're trying to accomplish
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:32.520]  and we're going to make a lot of mistakes along the way people mistakes
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:36.440]  institutional mistakes but it'll all come out in the end but it's going to be
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:39.720]  very painful uh it'll be financially an
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:45.720]  epic economically disastrous and uh in each country
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:51.480]  there's a good chance half the people who are alive now will not be alive then
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:54.520]  that's happy news but that is what the globalists are doing look
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:57.560]  they want to control the future they're monopoly men
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:01.320]  they want to control your breeding that's all these movies and tv shows go we
[1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:03.720]  should license having children they show you lots of
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:07.480]  examples why on tv you know how that's legitimate
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:11.320]  look at all the conditioning it's everywhere they want to dominate
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:16.040]  and control the future they want all for themselves this is so horrible
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:19.240]  uh justin in alabama you're on the air go ahead

[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:49.560]  your show and a friend of mine that i met at a camp that i go to

[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:48.280]  pleasure uh anyway okay first thing alex good choice of music on your uh on
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:50.840]  your show when you come off the commercials
[1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:54.600]  and uh mr chatman i got a little food for thought here
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:58.680]  we have the gold for so many other countries held here
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:03.000]  in the federal reserve in new york and also in fort nox
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:07.080]  when everything comes down i don't think they're going to want their gold back
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:10.760]  i understand that recently switzerland asked for their gold back which was
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:14.360]  being held at the federal reserve bank in new york i don't know what came of
[1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:17.720]  that i haven't seen anything about it since
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:22.120]  and i understand that just recently in the last couple of weeks germany
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:25.160]  has asked for their gold back as well they have gold
[1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:30.200]  from what i uh understand is um segregated
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:34.360]  being held uh in a vault at west point
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:37.560]  yeah the info i've got bobble has this when we get back from your take
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:41.000]  there's no gold at fort nox never been audited they've taken it out
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.960]  the gold is at the private new york fed that geithner
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:48.120]  perched atop then we'll have your comeback uh to that
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:52.120]  uh keith when we come back with bob chatman i'm alex jones

[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:16.840]  i was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:22.200]  yard straight was saying you know we can rant rave all day it's real serious
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:26.680]  what's happening in our society but it's also very simple
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:29.640]  private interests come in with corporate management strategies they bob your
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:33.240]  governments they take over they set up policies to consolidate power control
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:35.800]  in their hands that's bad for the average person
[1:54:35.800 --> 1:54:39.160]  they're federalizing everything training to accept troops on the streets
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:44.360]  bankrupting our future destroying our infrastructure by design on paper
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:48.920]  that's the new world order bob Chapman what is your understanding of where the
[1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:52.680]  gold of fort nox is we know they've been very secretive since the 60s of where
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:57.240]  that went well we have uh subscribers who
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:00.680]  formerly worked there and they say there's no gold there
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:04.520]  and so i think your comment about it being
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:09.400]  at the federal reserve bank in new york is correct if in fact
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:12.760]  u.s. gold is there i i don't know nobody does
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:17.240]  no audits since 1954 they also hold gold for other countries
[1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:20.840]  at their facility and we know they hold gold at west point
[1:55:20.840 --> 1:55:26.440]  for germany and that's how that's how ridiculously secretive all this is
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:29.640]  congress is just now learning the congressmen are so ignorant from ron
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:33.400]  paul that the fed is thumbing its nose saying no one can look at us
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:37.560]  no agency no branch of government and he's got 80
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:43.320]  what do you say 86 sponsors on the show ron paul has 86 sponsors right now
[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:49.880]  to audit these bastards well it's it's been a long time coming
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:54.280]  and i i sure hope it happens in 86 is quite a bit
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:58.680]  but i think by the time uh this thing gets really rolling
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:03.960]  he'll probably have 125 or 150 well what about just the issue will be a big fight
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:08.760]  because the the fed the bankers the wall street
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:12.600]  they will be in there pouring money pouring money
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:15.400]  like they did when they wanted to get nafta passed
[1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:21.160]  into these congressman's pockets well absolutely they're criminals but i mean
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:25.560]  that is the silver bullet if you can audit the fed and because we
[1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:28.760]  they've admitted what they've done all these crimes foreign money giving it to
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:32.760]  private people i mean it's just the issue though of
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:37.880]  showing how it's private and showing that it's above the law
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:41.960]  that i mean just what ron paul's doing if you just if you just point out what
[1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:45.320]  they're doing it's so criminal they should fall apart
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:48.760]  i mean that the point i'm trying to make here is is
[1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:53.560]  it's outrageous how openly corrupt this is it's outrageous how above the law it
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:57.000]  is and they're not above the law so if we just get the word out bob
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.960]  they should implode and that's what we're doing and it is happening
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:06.040]  and we're going all over the world with it uh yes it's an american problem in
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:09.800]  this case with the fed but the rest of the world is very very interested you
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.560]  know how do these people get away with it how they do they continue to get away
[1:57:13.560 --> 1:57:16.760]  with it and why don't you american stop it
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:20.280]  yeah that's what i get every day from africa and asian european
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:23.400]  they go come on americans we know you're not bad to do something about the
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:26.680]  criminals that run you uh bob i want to keep you 15 minutes
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:29.880]  the next hour if you can do it to do some more financial updating and talk
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:32.600]  about what's happening with gold then i'm gonna do a big news blitz and continue
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:35.960]  with calls listeners but going back to keith in texas did you have anything
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:39.960]  else you want to answer well the last thing i was gonna say is
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:43.480]  you know honestly if everything gets really really ugly i don't think
[1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:47.640]  honestly that whoever has the gold's gonna want to give it back to anybody
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:51.240]  and then also i want to say uh everybody listening
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:54.200]  you never know if your phone call is going to be that last phone call that
[1:57:54.200 --> 1:57:58.600]  gets somebody in congress or an ascended to act so if everybody
[1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:02.280]  is diligent you know we'll get this stuff taken care of we'll get this stuff
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:06.600]  stop i hear you yeah exactly people take action and say no the new owner can't
[1:58:06.600 --> 1:58:09.560]  get away with it it's because we have handed over our responsibility
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:12.920]  stop worrying about how government worked that the vacuum was filled by these
[1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:17.080]  crooks i mean folks they made my grandmother when she was in
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:21.640]  high school and she remembers her father turning his gold and he didn't turn it
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:26.120]  all in for paper money then they doubled the price of gold a year later
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:30.120]  publicly shipped it all to europe what they kept they took from american people
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:33.400]  they put it knocks and they won't say where it is
[1:58:33.400 --> 1:58:36.920]  see i mean think about it we took all your gold we won't say where it is
[1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:40.840]  we're the government sit down and shut up

[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:23.560]  calls hopefully on the economy for you a few of them have been on that on topic
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:29.160]  you've accurately gauged how the stock market will go up and down the last few
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:32.840]  years five six months a year ahead of time
[2:02:32.840 --> 2:02:36.040]  you've been saying it would go down and back up and back down again and then
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:40.600]  even listing the month what do you see happening in the next few months
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:46.680]  but not just with the markets but with the real economy with real estate bubble
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:52.680]  uh not not just the individual uh you know home
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:57.080]  real estate but the commercial real estate market what do you see happening
[2:02:57.080 --> 2:03:00.040]  with 600 plus thousand people losing their job every month
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:04.200]  while obama tells us the economy's great and the imf and world bank tell us
[2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:07.880]  tell us the economy's horrible what's going on there
[2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:13.960]  well i you know i think the uh i am f is uh creating the impression
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:19.640]  that uh we're responsible and the other guys aren't and that's why
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:23.240]  everything should be turned over to us and we should have
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:28.760]  a world monetary authority and world currency and things of that sort
[2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:34.760]  um the uh numbers uh on unemployment uh my
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:43.160]  use six numbers uh 19.2 percent and and john williams is 19.8 so
[2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:47.080]  unemployment true unemployment uh is
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:51.960]  close to 20 percent and you know what we're having a lot of
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:58.520]  companies that uh report in groups like uh the large-scale layoffs these are
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:03.720]  50 or more people and march alone were almost 3000
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:07.720]  now that varies anywhere from 50 workers to 50 000
[2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:13.160]  but most of the figures are in the in in the area of a thousand or two or
[2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:19.320]  three thousand and uh there have been
[2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:24.840]  there have been 31 414 since the start of the recession which
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:29.560]  officially was a year ago december and so uh unemployment
[2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:35.720]  officially is dreadful and it's going to continue that way
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:40.440]  there is nothing that's going to don't change anything
[2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:44.600]  i mean world trade is shut down uh the stress test results are coming out
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:48.120]  right now or what they want you to know we can put it that way yeah let's talk
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:51.800]  about what's in the future for banks they're saying the stress tests are
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:55.560]  so bad they can't even release them that was their plan to do that all along

[2:06:08.920 --> 2:06:13.160]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[2:06:13.160 --> 2:06:16.440]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:19.640]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[2:06:19.640 --> 2:06:24.120]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:27.800]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[2:06:27.800 --> 2:06:32.120]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[2:06:32.120 --> 2:06:37.240]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:40.840]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:08.360]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[2:07:08.360 --> 2:07:11.800]  than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled
[2:07:11.800 --> 2:07:14.760]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin
[2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:18.760]  the kdf dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water

[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:10.600]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:14.440 --> 2:08:17.960]  we always covered the private film deserve in the past we always discussed
[2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:21.480]  the new world order and now was going to bankrupt the world economy ever
[2:08:21.480 --> 2:08:24.280]  at stage terror attacks to get a police state in place
[2:08:24.280 --> 2:08:28.360]  then bankrupt the economy use the anti-terror forces against the domestic
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:32.120]  populations because they said they were going to do that
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:36.040]  they're now doing that we're now going into the final phase of open world
[2:08:36.040 --> 2:08:39.800]  government and the eugenics wars that they've
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:43.320]  already been carrying out in africa and latin america and asia
[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:46.920]  they're now announcing in england and australia one-child policies
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:51.240]  everything's happening and it is not pretty
[2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:55.800]  now bob Chapman this is a 64 million dollar question
[2:08:55.800 --> 2:08:58.920]  what is going to happen is the real economy keeps contracting as people lose
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:03.720]  their jobs but as the obama kool-aid drinkers
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:06.760]  still believe he's going to save them and he's going to fix their mortgage and
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:11.720]  he's going to take care of everything and he does these band-aid stunts like i'm
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:15.000]  going to shut down real ideac but then you read it he's going to reintroduce it
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:19.720]  and actually expand it with a new one or i'm going to stop torturing and then
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:22.920]  you read the executive order i'm going to continue the torture
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:26.280]  or i'm going to get rid of your credit card debt and it says oh
[2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:29.800]  on the bill we're going to say you've got to tell them
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:33.320]  at the top you're in a 30 percent tax uh...
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:37.320]  interest rate compounded the people are desperate
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:39.720]  they're in a consumer society they're going to keep taking them
[2:09:39.720 --> 2:09:45.160]  you know these stunts we already seem losing some of his support but
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:48.920]  still the kool-aid delusion has gone from he's going to fix it all to
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:52.920]  well he's my president i invested in him psychologically
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:56.280]  i don't care if he rapes me financially and betrays me
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:10:00.760]  i mean how does bob Chapman see this unfolding
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:06.360]  well it's more duplicitous behavior uh... the public is catching on fast this
[2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:09.560]  time i guess it was skeptical going in
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:13.160]  and uh... and they've discovered him for what he is
[2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:17.080]  and uh... i predicted that uh... by october
[2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:21.560]  that his rating would be down to 40 and um
[2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:25.960]  it wasn't too long ago it was 60 i guess two weeks ago
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:30.200]  and i saw a poll a recipe isn't came out and they said that
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:34.920]  that uh... it was lower than that and i saw an abc poll that said it was higher
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:38.760]  the point is it's all double talk what they're trying to do
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:47.000]  is gain time so they can execute the deflationary part of the depression
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:51.880]  when they want to at will we have an inflationary
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:58.200]  depression presently and so the more time that they can gain and buy
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:03.320]  by this duplicity the better they can time what they want to do and bring the
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:06.360]  whole house of cards down and of course they have to have
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:10.040]  uh... conflicts going all over the world which they are in the process of
[2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:13.880]  arranging and as we talked earlier about pakistan
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:17.480]  and and iran will come next after that and
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:21.080]  so that's the direction that economy
[2:11:21.080 --> 2:11:25.000]  finance is taking these are the reasons why
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:29.400]  and so this is why the actor the president gets up
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:34.680]  and tells you all this tom foolery one in fact it's ever gonna happen that way
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:37.640]  and it's gonna happen the way they want it to happen
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:42.520]  and uh... you had you know if anything else that comes from this program
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:46.520]  you've got to prepare yourself for bad times
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:52.520]  we're going to have a sociological experience in america
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:56.680]  i think very similar and i think we're into it already
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:03.720]  it's beginning just like it was during the 1940s and 50s when i grew up
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:07.560]  and people are going to be returning to a time when
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:12.440]  a lot of people didn't have cars if you had a car and
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:15.960]  you know it wasn't working too well you fixed it you didn't go out and buy a
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:19.800]  new one and so the world is going to change dramatically
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:24.280]  and then that's before they pull the plug and so where is the plug and you
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:28.680]  would i and uh... paul carragh rovitz had discussed this before
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:32.680]  we said two or three years away and it is it's two or three years away could be
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:35.560]  even longer or they may be an event it might be
[2:12:35.560 --> 2:12:38.520]  shorter the point is that's what you got a plan on
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:41.800]  but no doubt no doubt though they are the
[2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:45.960]  that they're pulling the plug
[2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:53.560]  well they will in totality when they when everything is in place for them
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:57.560]  that's terrible i wish we could stop it uh... look at this obama rejects truth
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:01.080]  panel so there's all this hype about he's going to hold bush responsible for
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:02.840]  torture and he says no
[2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:05.560]  we're going to continue it and we're going to protect the people that did it
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:09.240]  and then i have obama noids emailing me saying he's stopping the torture
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:14.360]  and then we got a new horrible uh... appeals court ruling saying that
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:17.960]  interpreting the supreme court decision to be that the government can ban
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:21.960]  whatever guns they want i told you folks that that's how they were going to
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:25.880]  interpret it that it wasn't a pro-second amendment ruling
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:27.960]  here we are six months later it's happening
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:30.840]  we'll get more into that later i want to bring ted anderson up briefly
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:34.520]  here because ted anderson has gold he has silver
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:39.400]  he has silver he got at seventeen dollars and seventy one cents he's still selling
[2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:43.480]  it even though silver's way up and you can't find these just any type of silver
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:46.760]  dollar out there any cheaper than this most places are twenty twenty five
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:49.480]  dollars apiece and he's got a bunch of gold and silver
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:53.720]  from a couple weeks ago uh... when when the gold was lower than it is now
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:58.440]  i want to bring ted up but but bob you know i only push what i believe in and
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:02.040]  i really think people should get firearms horrible foods water filters
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:05.480]  big article about a bunch of people sick today drinking bottle water
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:09.080]  i believe people really should take care of themselves and try to get self
[2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:12.200]  sufficient because if there's a twenty percent chance we're going into a great
[2:14:12.200 --> 2:14:17.960]  depression things will completely unravel into a mad max level
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:22.600]  uh... i mean you agree that if we go into a depression which you're seeing as a
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:26.360]  foregone conclusion that it will be far worse because people are not
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:30.760]  self-sufficient yes it would be and you know
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:35.480]  i felt this way ever since i discovered what these people were trying to do in
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:40.280]  the early nineteen sixties and i have felt the way you just described about
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:44.760]  protecting oneself that in that manner and i thought
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:48.600]  that things would happen even more quickly than i have i didn't think
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:52.360]  we will be looking at twenty ten and twenty twelve for these events that we
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:56.120]  just discussed i thought they would have happened in nineteen sixty nine or
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:00.040]  nineteen seventy two et cetera and
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:04.760]  they weren't prepared and at that time there were movements about
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:09.720]  that delayed what they wanted to do but people have got to prepare
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:14.280]  a better you should have the insurance of having these things around
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:17.960]  they're not having them do you think we can stop it insurance policy
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:21.480]  i mean i go back to the question two minutes ago do you think we can stop
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:25.560]  it if we were to get the audit of the fed and ron paul agreed they'll probably
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:28.600]  stage something if you try to be really looks like it's going to do it
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:32.040]  i mean as our movement marches were actually hitting pay dirt
[2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:37.320]  and waking folks up uh... is there a chance to stop these people or if we
[2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:40.680]  start defeating them will they just put it even in more high gear but at least
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:44.120]  we're now on a four-footing with them and know who they are and have built up
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:46.360]  our numbers i mean obviously fighting
[2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:49.800]  you know exposing them as a way to go but is there any way out of this without
[2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:54.280]  just absolute curtains well yeah i think there is
[2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:59.160]  uh... and the the the exposure of the fed in the exposure of
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:04.040]  what happened to our economy and the free trade and globalization and how it
[2:16:04.040 --> 2:16:07.560]  figures in and the the bringing the economy not only
[2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:10.760]  here but in europe in particular to its knees
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:14.920]  and and expose how these people did this the american public
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:20.280]  will be just beside themselves and they will demand that congress do something
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:25.080]  and the court system and if they don't they will be revolution in the country
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:28.760]  the people are going to get to a point that
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:33.480]  they're not going to take it anymore but there is a way to stop that in ron paul's
[2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:37.720]  movement the exposure of the fed will expose everything
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:41.560]  from wall street and banking and corporate america the things that they
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:45.960]  should not have been doing all these years and the answer is yes
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:49.480]  absolutely well the government is a bad employee
[2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:52.680]  who's gotten out of control and we the boss show up and they've hired a big
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:56.280]  thug to intimidate us and that's the militarized police and military
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:00.200]  and so they've decided to go ahead and just screw what the people want
[2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:03.400]  they're going ahead with this and that's why they're federalizing everything i
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.880]  mean i got mainstream news federalizing the police
[2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:08.280]  it is happening folks it is a collision course
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:11.720]  ted anderson i appreciate you coming on even holding for the last ten minutes
[2:17:11.720 --> 2:17:13.800]  while i've been ranting with bob Chapman but
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:17.800]  uh... tell folks about today's offers i sure will sure good to hear about
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:20.920]  something about the federal reserve system and having it shut down
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:24.200]  right now currently i have the frank still at yesterday's price even though
[2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:28.280]  gold is up again today uh... actually was from back when gold is
[2:17:28.280 --> 2:17:31.400]  in that eight hundred and eighty range eight seventy five
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:34.360]  frank said two seventeen we have the british sovereigns
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:39.160]  at two sixty seven of course like you said silvers up again today it's hit
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:42.520]  uh... twelve ninety eight almost thirteen dollars an ounce now
[2:17:42.520 --> 2:17:47.960]  and i still have those lakota nation rounds at seventeen dollars and seventy one cents and
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:51.880]  i am just in completely surprised and maybe i shouldn't be
[2:17:51.880 --> 2:17:55.720]  on how many people want to buy these things probably because of the fact
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:59.640]  that uh... that uh... it has that fifty dollars face in the clothe
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:03.240]  lakota nation is flying in the feds face with their currency
[2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:06.840]  uh... rather way rather have a silver dollar than i would have a
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:09.480]  uh... paper note from the federal reserve system
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:13.000]  and i you know really really bothers me is there's i have people coming to me
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:16.920]  with these four one case you know some of them are worth millions of dollars
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:19.400]  in a drop down into the hundreds of thousands
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:22.760]  where others might have fifty sixty thousand dollars for the retweck
[2:18:22.760 --> 2:18:25.960]  retirement and they're lucky to have twenty to thirty now
[2:18:25.960 --> 2:18:30.040]  unbelievable people should be turning this stuff over you can get a gold IRA
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:32.920]  if you want to we do sell them here and i would
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:36.920]  suggest that you at least do that but get physical gold and silver in your
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:40.680]  hand and i'm not knocking having a gold IRA but there's nothing like having the
[2:18:40.680 --> 2:18:43.080]  golden silver and bearing it on the back forty
[2:18:43.080 --> 2:18:46.360]  i mean there is nothing like that feeling of security
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:50.200]  and having the firearm to defend it i mean even if it's a couple of the coat
[2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:53.640]  of rounds or if you're wealthy a big old treasure chest you put out somewhere
[2:18:53.640 --> 2:18:58.600]  i mean it folks are insane if they don't move on those great deals you've got

[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:38.440]  hey alex how you doing hey didn't goldfinger
[2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:43.000]  steal the golden fortnack and is an odd job working for a
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:51.160]  homeland security but alex seriously a long time no talk to but i just
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:54.520]  wanted to tell you about people who see the truth
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:58.920]  something i noticed that you get to a level or you have something deep inside
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:01.720]  and i don't want to get that pathetic on your ending
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:05.800]  but most people can't understand the depth
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:11.320]  of truth and and see things in like when you look at a video or something
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:15.000]  you can analyze the truth right away you could take the truth out of it
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:20.200]  and winnow the errors out of it and only certain people have that and the
[2:25:20.200 --> 2:25:24.840]  other people that have that know that those people have a tooth
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:30.520]  is some kind of thing so don't be impatient you're causing a tidal wave
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:36.120]  okay well i'm just gonna be right sure i'm just an average guy we're just all
[2:25:36.120 --> 2:25:38.840]  in this together i just can't i just know my
[2:25:38.840 --> 2:25:42.040]  family's in danger we're all in danger and i want to bring these globalists
[2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:46.120]  to justice i mean bob Chapman you've told me before you burn with desire don't
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:50.040]  you to bring these guys to justice i mean i'm it's also competitive i'm
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:53.640]  tired of scam artists and thugs and bullies always winning i want to kick
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:57.480]  their butt what about you bob i feel the same way
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:02.760]  i've always been super competitive and uh and we're birds of a feather only i'm
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:07.720]  old enough to be a dad but you know it's 73 years old is very few people do what
[2:26:07.720 --> 2:26:10.360]  i do and i do it for that reason
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:13.800]  can i do one more thing yes or go ahead okay um
[2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:17.640]  it's like the city folk and the country folk like the country guy is real
[2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:20.600]  shy so the city guy comes and takes everything
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:24.120]  and takes the country guy to the absolute limit
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:28.360]  and then pretty soon the country guy whips the tail off the city guy that
[2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:32.440]  happened in my life many many times because the country guy
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:35.640]  was um captain cow crap and everything else
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:39.800]  but the city guy was taking it easy he had the manipulative nature
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:45.320]  so i think that there's enough good americans that they'll eventually defeat
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:49.720]  even these lucifer listen listen listen i agree with you
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:52.680]  and the globalists call it a scientific dictatorship
[2:26:52.680 --> 2:26:56.040]  because they know that too that's why they're gearing up the tyranny
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:59.560]  that's why i'm warning the public i mean bob we've been telling them for years
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:02.920]  you've been telling them for decades they're setting up this anti-terror
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:07.160]  police state for the conservatives for the gun owners for the landowners
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:11.160]  for the middle class and now they admit it's us
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:15.640]  there's no more denial there's a world government and its enemy is
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:21.080]  free market constitutionalist bob jetman absolutely
[2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:25.880]  absolutely and you know that's the way we predicted in the sixties it would
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:28.840]  roll out we just didn't think it'd take this long
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:33.960]  and uh in the process what they've done is destroy the american economy
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:38.040]  but i predicted in 1967 exactly how they were doing it
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:42.360]  bringing us down to the level of the third world in order to force us to accept
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:45.720]  because there was no other way that people would accept it
[2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:49.400]  and so if you read about it it's a natural course of events
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:53.080]  well tarpley he's a amazing economist in zonerite
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:58.120]  uh on top of his class he says that we've really lost half our standard of
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:02.280]  living since the mid-1960s and so it's just been happening
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:05.800]  incrementally is that an accurate statement by tarpley in your opinion
[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:11.480]  i i pick out 72 because after august 16th to 71 when they went off the gold
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:17.640]  standard that really got it underway and in you had to have today
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:21.560]  two incomes instead of the one that was necessary
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:25.720]  in 1972 to have the standard of living that you have
[2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:31.960]  or have had uh in our society and so yes he's correct it doesn't
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:37.560]  appear whether it was 62 or 72 the point is it's been coming for a long time
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:41.960]  and we have half the buying power or less than we had then yeah and instead of
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:44.600]  both the man and woman having to work both the man and woman got to work two
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:48.200]  jobs uh going back to uh david anything else david
[2:28:48.200 --> 2:28:53.000]  yeah one more thing um remember k.r.f.1 i don't believe everything he says but
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:56.760]  the consciousness thing is going to have the main effect
[2:28:56.760 --> 2:29:01.640]  and i just want to say that for lastly lindsay williams gave us the solution
[2:29:01.640 --> 2:29:07.560]  and he said the only thing they feared was the masses waking up

[2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:40.600]  hi alex hi i'm i listen to your show um um pretty often
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:44.520]  and you do a great job but i'm really outraged that um
[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:48.040]  obama said he's not going to have a commission to
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:52.520]  um investigate the CIA tortures and i mean that's
[2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:58.440]  that's a big blow to americans i think i mean that sends the wrong message to
[2:33:58.440 --> 2:34:02.040]  you know the rest of the world would think that you know we support terrorism
[2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:06.360]  and things like that i mean how do we go about getting him to
[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:10.600]  like pressure him to prosecute well number one you had a few democrats
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:14.440]  saying we might look at a commission trying to pacify
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:17.800]  democrats that are and in the general public and people that are upset about
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:20.200]  tortures civil libertarians people that
[2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:23.560]  don't want a police state okay we might look at it
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:27.480]  and then ron manual the real president and he literally is the president i mean
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:31.400]  this was in the new york times that he bosses obama around in front of people
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:36.520]  when obama argues with him he'll crack his knuckles literally going
[2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:41.560]  this is the new york times pull it up style uh into google ron manual cracks
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:44.680]  knuckles and obama's here and he just looks you know literally you got a
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:48.040]  problem you got a problem we're getting literally like the bully
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:51.320]  imagine in front of the congressional leaders going
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:54.920]  and obama literally grovels because so
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:58.840]  a manual said look monday he said we're not going to investigate torture
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:03.240]  it's going to continue and so now obama rejects truth panel
[2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:06.440]  commission would have investigated abuses and terrorism fight
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:10.680]  yes we're fighting terrorism so yes it is outrageous alex and i'm glad you're
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:14.040]  upset about it but look he got he's financed by
[2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:16.760]  the very same people
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:23.720]  he i mean obama is bad news he's yeah he's he's crazy yeah
[2:35:23.720 --> 2:35:28.200]  well no he's crazy like a fox yeah yeah he's like a big puppet

[2:38:56.520 --> 2:38:59.800]  there was someone that wrote on there um the use of
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:04.520]  different terms in the obama deception um the cfr was mentioned so many times
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:07.800]  bill deberg mentioned as many times and then they went down to the massage
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:12.440]  and i got on there to defend you then it turned out that that post that i
[2:39:12.440 --> 2:39:16.680]  replied to was gone and so obviously made me
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:20.280]  very curious and then you know subsequent to
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:23.400]  to that there was just many many posts that were deleted

[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:49.240]  i never had forums and i never had um
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:53.880]  comments on the stories because we had tried that five six years ago
[2:39:53.880 --> 2:39:58.280]  and had death threats and people posing as as other people
[2:39:58.280 --> 2:40:02.520]  and then filing police reports on us and we said my god these message boards are
[2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:06.840]  trouble we got to get rid of these because we don't have the money to
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:11.640]  police it to try to control it uh so i got rid of them
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:15.080]  and then i said you know what let's just try it again
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:19.640]  and at first we had this i don't know how to explain we have like a caching
[2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:23.240]  server and then actual servers because the sites get a lot of traffic and
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:26.680]  there's a lot of graphics it isn't just a text site so
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:30.840]  we use you know 30 something terabytes just on web stuff every month i mean it's
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:34.600]  it's insane some months 90 terabytes of you know it's video
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:39.080]  it's it's a lot of money and i try to get the best prices and bids and spend
[2:40:39.080 --> 2:40:42.360]  months on the phone trying to find the really cheap man with and the upper
[2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:45.080]  tier bandwidth i mean i don't know how to explain what it's like
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:48.680]  to actually try to build this and do this and i'm not complaining
[2:40:48.680 --> 2:40:52.520]  i'm just saying you've got to understand what i'm going through
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:55.880]  um and then people would go in there and say
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:40:59.240]  whack the president they go in there and say do this do that
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:02.840]  and i have secret service showing up here at the office
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:05.880]  and uh i'd say folks you got to quit doing that they go in the comments and
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:08.520]  say oh you lie there's no secret service and i'm you know
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:12.040]  and people are calling well what was the server show up at my house
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:15.560]  so i did get moderators for the prison planet
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:21.400]  dot com forum they were folks that we saw were posting well you know doing
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:25.960]  good stories edifying and the co-intel pro flooded in so
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:29.320]  incredibly with lies about myself or anything else
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:33.000]  that the majority of the readers of my site
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.960]  asked us to please we're going to quit coming to your site
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:39.240]  we're going to quit pointing people at your articles and your stories
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:46.040]  if you don't stop all this with f u and i'm going to do this and let's kill all
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:48.840]  the jews and let's kill the blacks and all the
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:51.960]  rest of it and and and now you see what the forums have
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:54.840]  done for me uh you got this and i'm probably going to just
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:41:57.400]  get rid of them i'll just let everybody know that i'm really strongly
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:01.560]  considering it because uh it's not censorship they're mine
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:05.640]  i own them censorship is when i come
[2:42:05.640 --> 2:42:10.440]  to your website or i come to your radio show
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:14.760]  and i'm the government and i stop you from having a website or a radio show
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:17.240]  if the government showed up and told me i couldn't do my show anymore
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:22.760]  that would be censorship uh you know if you own a coffee shop and there's a
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:26.600]  message board people can put up messages and and and their and their
[2:42:26.600 --> 2:42:31.560]  personal cards and somebody puts up
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:39.000]  uh business cards that say call this number to screw my wife
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.880]  and the owner of the coffee shop the diner goes you can't have that excuse
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:47.000]  my french there folks you know that's the kind of stuff that goes on
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.960]  uh
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:53.240]  hey bob you can't hang that on the on the message board
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:57.880]  don't you censor me david or whatever the you know the deli or diner's name is
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:43:00.600]  i'll put whatever i want on your message board
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:03.560]  next you go how about you just get out of this diner and don't ever come back
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:06.680]  here again or you know the if they started
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:10.200]  soliciting murder on the on the on the diner message board
[2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:13.640]  hey call this number if you want somebody killed well the owner of the
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:17.320]  diner or the manager's going to walk over and pull that off there
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:22.520]  and so are there overzealous people uh in there uh yes i have seen examples of
[2:43:22.520 --> 2:43:25.960]  that we've got five or six moderators they can't even
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:30.200]  deal with half of the craziness and at a certain point i can't have the fbi and
[2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:35.160]  secret service here and then the the nazi kid uh allegedly and he's admitted
[2:43:35.160 --> 2:43:38.760]  to it shoots three cops and is on info wars dot com
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:43.560]  attacking me for censorship and then you go and there he is
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:48.360]  months later his poster on there still i guess our censorship isn't good enough
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:51.480]  of the side i own i wish i had people in the money
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:55.160]  for moderators that would have seen you know stuff like that to get it off
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:58.280]  earlier because man i was all over the national news
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:44:01.800]  is killing the cops and they said the white supremacist
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:05.000]  kid loved me and did it because of me basically and then it turned out he was
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:10.280]  on my website attacking me see i'm at a real level
[2:44:10.280 --> 2:44:14.520]  i'm in the real world i got a payroll to me i got radio shows to do i got
[2:44:14.520 --> 2:44:19.240]  callers to take news to cover and all the other networks all the little
[2:44:19.240 --> 2:44:23.880]  patriot websites all they do is fight and and say who's the best leader and
[2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:26.920]  who's an agent and who isn't i'm just here's covering what's
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:32.360]  happening and saying you got power take action your leaders
[2:44:34.680 --> 2:44:37.720]  and you know i don't think i'll get rid of the info wars and the prison plant
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:40.680]  and all that stuff if people get there's a lot of great comments a lot of
[2:44:40.680 --> 2:44:45.000]  edifying stuff a lot of great things you know the first six months or so i had
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  the comment pages they were just attacking me
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:51.960]  everywhere saying lies and my guys would say man don't you want to have somebody
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:55.400]  moderate this and i said i'll let them have their first amendment
[2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:59.880]  on my site you know let them go wild till the secret service started showing up
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:03.400]  then i went but it didn't matter by then i was already being blamed of
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:07.080]  censoring people on my own site not censorship read the definition
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:09.960]  because i earlier didn't explain this and i said i take calls but it's
[2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:13.800]  impossible because this guy has a question that's got to be answered
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:17.720]  and the way it's explained to me is there's a
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:22.280]  caching server that takes all the big requests because the site kept going
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:25.160]  down and shutting down before and then there's the main server
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:28.840]  so it takes three four five minutes for your comment
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:33.160]  to post and i would see comment after comment sometimes 20 of them going
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:36.680]  my post doesn't post any censoring my post doesn't post any censoring
[2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:40.840]  my post doesn't post any censoring because it would lag time for the server
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:43.960]  to update and post it
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:47.640]  and then and then it would say oh it finally posted i caught them censoring
[2:45:47.640 --> 2:45:53.720]  so they went ahead and posted all this you know f u alex
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:57.560]  because the server has a lag time for posting so that's how
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:01.960]  the schizophrenia started that i was censoring
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:05.000]  and so people would say why are these comments all screwed up why is it all
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:08.520]  these crazy people and i go oh i guess that's my audience
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:12.040]  and so to have some semblance it's kind of like whack-a-mole
[2:46:12.040 --> 2:46:17.400]  some semblance of it like there's there's also people that go in and spam
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:20.840]  and it'll be posted every other comment in every story
[2:46:20.840 --> 2:46:26.440]  check out this news website and then to post down check out the news website
[2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:29.800]  again check it out again check it out again
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:32.920]  check out this radio show it's a radio show that lies about me
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:38.760]  or uh over and over again uh check out this other radio
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.600]  network over and over and over again and i and i and so we put
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:46.280]  spam software in there to stop viagra ads being spammed too and they're like
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:50.040]  yes censoring me well of course you're being knocked off the site
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:53.640]  you're going into every page posting your website
[2:46:53.640 --> 2:46:57.480]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:02.280]  and the spam software sees that you know what'll happen if we don't have spam
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:06.200]  software viagra ads were everywhere
[2:47:06.200 --> 2:47:09.800]  mortgage ads look at every other message board it
[2:47:09.800 --> 2:47:13.320]  makes you type a code in every time you post
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:16.760]  you know they'll have that weird picture code so computers can't read it
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:20.760]  and you've got to enter in that little code first and then your name
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:24.600]  and we're busy but we're going to implement that everything else
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:28.920]  because because it's screwing up the sites
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:33.000]  it's screwing it up just all of it the viagra ads the
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:37.240]  i work for the vatican uh
[2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:40.040]  people plugging their other what people don't like it either i mean it'll be
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:42.840]  every article over and over again check this and by the way
[2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:47.640]  all of you doing that you want to go in and write a post a comment about the
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:50.200]  article and then say by the way check out my site we'll let that happen
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:53.640]  but you just go into every article and spam spam spam spam
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:57.560]  spam spam spam spam spam spam and then we're like
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:03.480]  you know the ai computer censors you using your term censor for spam and
[2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:06.440]  you
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:09.320]  yeah you start a website buddy let people do that to you
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:12.680]  you have the secret service at your office and then see how you like it in
[2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:15.720]  fact i i need more moderators i've told the
[2:48:15.720 --> 2:48:19.720]  prisonplanet.com guys that seem to be great we need
[2:48:19.720 --> 2:48:21.800]  over at info wars dot com prisonplanet.com
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:25.800]  i've told paul watch it come on over email rob d at info wars dot com
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:27.960]  the problem is we gotta see somebody's been posting for a long time and didn't
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:32.040]  schizophrenic to give you those moderation powers because it is just
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:34.840]  and the viagra ads get through the computers figure out how to get around
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:37.880]  those you know whatever you can call into this show
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:40.840]  you can talk about whatever you can do whatever on this show
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:45.560]  uh but i may even because the the calls are so weird i may even start
[2:48:45.560 --> 2:48:48.520]  saying what are you calling about and see if the person isn't so stoned that
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:52.680]  they can't talk it's my radio show me i'm here doing this
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:56.360]  every day i put my life on the line it isn't about alex jones it's my radio
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:48:59.080]  show i'm trying to make it about the new world order people want to make it about
[2:48:59.080 --> 2:49:04.040]  me fine don't come into my diner and put uh kill
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:06.840]  the president on the wall i'm going to pull it down
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:10.600]  you call that censorship fine good i'm proud of it then
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:14.040]  if not having the secret service here every week is censorship then
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:17.480]  buddy you enjoy it
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:23.800]  now there you go that was 10 minutes i just it's impossible to take their calls
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:27.480]  let's go ahead and uh don't worry about everything's collapsing anyways
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:30.120]  and you'll be able to blame me for it then not the bankers and they'll probably
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:33.720]  win but if people be blaming the jews the vatican the
[2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:37.640]  people are elves all day instead of the new world order which we can all
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:41.480]  admit is evil and corrupt coming down on us
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:45.000]  i think it's more popular attacking me than it is we're attacking obama and
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:48.840]  ariel charon everybody else speak if that's good for me as an individual
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:52.840]  for web traffic and my name it isn't good for america in the world
[2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:58.600]  but keep attacking keep on keep on you just make me stronger
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:01.320]  and that was a nice caller i wasn't addressing all that at you sir that's
[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:04.360]  another thing that happens i'll address big general things i'm not seeing your

[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:19.000]  what i'm talking about and they'll say i'm talking about them

[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:13.640]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[2:52:13.640 --> 2:52:19.080]  just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama
[2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:21.640]  is working for the best interests of the american people
[2:52:21.640 --> 2:52:26.280]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if
[2:52:26.280 --> 2:52:30.440]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:52:30.440 --> 2:52:34.120]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[2:52:34.120 --> 2:52:37.720]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[2:52:37.720 --> 2:52:41.240]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government

[2:54:14.760 --> 2:54:20.040]  i've foreseen that not hard going wait a minute you said gig was censoring you
[2:54:20.040 --> 2:54:26.520]  you said youtube is yes they hold out that on dig if your
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:29.720]  if your article gets voted up it goes on the main page
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:33.640]  and then it they admit it that well we allow one of our people
[2:54:33.640 --> 2:54:38.040]  to bury it and then that goes against say five thousand votes of people that
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:41.320]  want to vote it up we're not having some voting site
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:45.800]  on info wars and holding out that what's on the front page is what you voted for
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:50.280]  though we are actually going to have a dig system like that
[2:54:50.280 --> 2:54:52.600]  with some new things we're about to add and we're just you know whatever you
[2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:57.400]  vote up what you vote up that's fine so again there's that separate issue too
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:55:01.640]  youtube acts like they put on the main page whatever is number one or in the
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:05.720]  top hundred they don't so see we're not holding anything out
[2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:09.400]  here well we tried to give you freedom you got the secret service sick on us in
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:14.360]  the fbi that's over it's my website mine mine i'm proud of it
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:17.480]  whom you caught me they'll take that video clip put on the web say look we
[2:55:17.480 --> 2:55:20.680]  caught this secret video transmission of him on the web
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:23.480]  and they'll even cut that part out right there and say it was a secret radio
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:25.720]  transmission i've seen that before
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:28.920]  yeah it's a secret video transmission and only you were tuned in on right now
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:33.000]  and you caught me confessing mental illness and see that's what mentally
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:36.200]  old people do they invent fake victories for themselves
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:40.040]  you know how many times i love it mark twain said rumors of my devout
[2:55:40.040 --> 2:55:43.320]  demise have been greatly exaggerated how many times people

[2:55:50.440 --> 2:55:54.600]  order to contend with the schizophrenic dumb down mass that's that's not a big
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:57.800]  problem because there's good people out there we're looking for to fight the
[2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:01.560]  new world order that's who we're looking for the schizophrenics well they're
[2:56:01.560 --> 2:56:04.520]  going to be schizophrenic and i feel sorry for him
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:09.880]  let's go ahead and talk to tom in tejas you're on the air tom
[2:56:09.880 --> 2:56:13.720]  afternoon alex are you today pretty good sir first of all just want to comment
[2:56:13.720 --> 2:56:18.040]  i'm a regular visitor to your info wars dot com side i read every story and i
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:22.360]  you know i i was i will attest to the idiots that post on the comment section
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:26.840]  it discussed me and it if you see people doing that ignore them
[2:56:26.840 --> 2:56:30.440]  don't get called it's called trolls we'll have some horrible
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:33.720]  we'll have some horrible anti-second amendment ruling
[2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:36.840]  and the first comment is alex jones martyrs children and then the whole
[2:56:36.840 --> 2:56:40.680]  comment is about that it's to hijacking my site
[2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:45.800]  and so no we need to clean that out and most of our operatives we've got to
[2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:48.680]  get control of that and so i'm telling folks uh
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:51.720]  people want to help we need more moderators to control you know to try to
[2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:55.240]  keep this under control now the reason i'm calling today those uh
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:56:58.840]  few years back there was a man named steven kimball aims who wrote a few
[2:56:58.840 --> 2:57:02.440]  essays on the new world order and the conspiracy
[2:57:02.440 --> 2:57:06.360]  and uh it kind of fell into obscurity but i was just wondering if you were
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:09.080]  familiar with him he wrote one called the ultimate delusion
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:13.880]  uh a few others that were very enlightening and very brilliant essays
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:16.840]  and i was just uh if you were familiar with him what your take on him was
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:20.440]  no i mean i'm i bet if i went and read it i might have seen it
[2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:24.440]  but no i have i have those essays um on one of my
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:29.480]  blogs on our website thegreendragon.neen.com the green dragon
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:34.200]  of course that is where uh the 1775 uh stuff started with the boston tea party
[2:57:34.200 --> 2:57:37.080]  yes exactly that's that's the concept of our
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:40.920]  group there on Neen Networks and if anybody's interested they can go there
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:43.240]  and it's good job you can check out the blog
[2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:47.960]  all right tom good to hear from you uh let's go to uh another caller keith

[2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:01.720]  washington post blogs geoengineering our way out of global warming
[2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:05.960]  and i was wondering what your take on this was now they're telling people that
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:09.560]  they're going to use uh you know methods to change the
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:12.760]  weather but for years they've been telling us that no such thing exists is
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:16.520]  this going to cause people to wake up or people to asleep they can't see military
[2:58:16.520 --> 2:58:19.560]  operations right above their head well and then when they and i did see the
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:23.000]  washington post article there's been a bunch of them the white house uh
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:28.360]  chief scientist saying plus you look at the science
[2:58:28.360 --> 2:58:31.080]  what they're doing is actually causing global heating
[2:58:31.080 --> 2:58:34.440]  so they're messing with the weather creating the crisis
[2:58:34.440 --> 2:58:38.360]  then they will offer their solution micromanaging every fast of your life

[3:00:12.120 --> 3:00:15.880]  them they have been chemtrail spraying when key
[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:19.000]  weather fronts come in to dissipate the rain or to make it
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:22.840]  more intense different programs
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:27.000]  and none of it's called chemtrails officially but under the aerosol direct
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:31.080]  semi direct spraying campaigns tens of thousands of different
[3:00:31.080 --> 3:00:35.640]  missions thousands of operations the whole earth's 20 percent darker
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:39.320]  massive terra farming everywhere that's nasa's own numbers and now because the
[3:00:39.320 --> 3:00:43.480]  public got upset about it three years ago government written textbooks tell the
[3:00:43.480 --> 3:00:46.200]  kids gonna tell the parents doesn't exist the
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:49.160]  kids textbook oh yes we're spraying you to stop global warming

[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:56.840]  they're creating the crises manipulating the weather
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:00.760]  to make it more violent to then scare the people into accepting
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:03.800]  this global government the name of saving us and all these carbon taxes
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:07.800]  and that's what the witch doctors 5 000 years ago whether it was in the americas
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:11.800]  or in asia central asia the middle east europe they would
[3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:15.400]  they were mathematicians they would study historically
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:19.240]  and they're in their little private secret societies you know the witch
[3:01:19.240 --> 3:01:21.960]  doctors when the sun was going to have an eclipse when the moon was going to
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:25.880]  have an eclipse the names of the stars they had calendars
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:29.480]  and the the hunters were going off at hunting deer and building huts and
[3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:33.320]  you know having parties and dancing and hanging out with the women and
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:37.080]  you know having fights and all the rest of meanwhile the witch doctors sat up on
[3:01:37.080 --> 3:01:40.280]  the hilltop figuring this out and they would come out and say you have done
[3:01:40.280 --> 3:01:45.640]  bad and they would explain you have not given
[3:01:45.640 --> 3:01:48.840]  offerings to moog guy the flying serpent
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:52.760]  and they would go ah old man my father said you were full of it there's no such
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:58.760]  thing as moog guy fine three days from now you will see the sun
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:02:03.640]  eaten by the serpent to show you your evil
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:08.120]  and the eyes shut up and then the serpent the eclipse would happen and they
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:10.520]  would all oh please wish doctor will give you
[3:02:10.520 --> 3:02:14.600]  you know the best maidens will give you the best food the best drinks the best
[3:02:14.600 --> 3:02:18.520]  huts anything you want good to show your fealty to me

[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:29.640]  and then trauma-based mind control began out of that and that's all it is
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:33.880]  the earth it's melting the ice caps of death destruction
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:38.040]  oh god where but but people know what an eclipse is now so they're telling you
[3:02:38.040 --> 3:02:40.680]  free when it gets cold it's global cooling when it gets hot it's global
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:44.120]  heating we have seasons this happens normally
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:48.120]  so they hype this hype this hype this hype this hype this hype this
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:53.720]  and now they are engaging in all sorts of weather warfare admittedly
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:02:57.160]  and doing a lot of really strange weather things and then going oh my god we
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:00.200]  need global government to save you from it
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:04.280]  so uh Keith you asked a question does that answer your question
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:07.640]  yeah i mean i just wonder if it's the mercury in the shots or the forehead in
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:10.200]  the water what's making people not realize that there's
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:15.880]  grid patterns obvious military operations going on right over their head
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:18.920]  it's for your own good sir please yeah appreciate your
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:22.040]  i appreciate your call look look what's and we're gonna take more calls but
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:25.880]  what's happening here is they've slowly
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:29.800]  incrementally as i keep saying with the ambient background
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:33.080]  of the tyranny and the police state and the surveillance and the drugging and
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:36.680]  the water and food and air they just keep slowly turning it up denying
[3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:39.160]  there's no global government there's no global bank
[3:03:39.160 --> 3:03:42.200]  there's no bank of the world there's no chemtrails there's no weather
[3:03:42.200 --> 3:03:45.560]  modification there's no spring that's crazy people
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:49.560]  and they'll mix in things that really aren't real there's no chubacabras
[3:03:49.560 --> 3:03:53.320]  there's no witches on brooms there's no easter bunny
[3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:57.720]  there's no private fellow reserve there's no seren nerve gas testing on
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:03.080]  trips there's no imbonable snowman so see they mix
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:07.800]  real things like the private fellow reserve in with chubacabras
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:11.480]  and then the public the general public goes i don't believe in the private
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:15.400]  fellow reserve or in easter bunnies or santa claus
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:19.000]  shut up conspiracy theorist and there are like schizophrenics dancing around

[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:34.120]  so they can point the crazies to and go look that's your conspiracy theorist
[3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:39.800]  that's that's who they are them they can point at the white supremacist you

[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:57.880]  not the other way around so that they've got all sorts of ways of trying to
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:05:02.360]  tire in front of the people but it's not working anymore

[3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:09.560]  new item you won't ask for directions when you're lost
[3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:13.560]  once in a while you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car

[3:08:39.800 --> 3:08:43.000]  and i i really try to tell everybody about getting about the movies and
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:45.960]  everything else i just wanted to comment on the how
[3:08:45.960 --> 3:08:51.640]  um the surveillance blimps um
[3:08:51.640 --> 3:08:55.560]  i would i i just wanted to say that the acronym for them is
[3:08:55.560 --> 3:09:00.280]  hAA that's high altitude airship yes mm-hmm
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:03.960]  high altitude airship and when you when you do a search in the search and so
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:06.600]  way you don't come up with some crazy conspiracy
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:10.920]  site or anything like that you come up immediately with lockheed martin
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:14.360]  and that's for those people out there who doubt your integrity when it comes to
[3:09:14.360 --> 3:09:18.120]  this subject over here you can go right into a search engine search out high
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:21.320]  altitude they've launched them 10 years ago
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:26.040]  than seven years ago and they're over every major city at 95 000 feet they
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:28.920]  can watch areas much you know much bigger than say
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:32.520]  dallas fort worth area it's just huge the thousands of square miles
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:36.040]  and they admit they're tracking and scanning us and following our cars and
[3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:39.320]  it's it's basically like giant spy satellites but they can carry a lot more
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:43.960]  equipment and cheaper and they msnbc new york times
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:48.200]  washed in post with them launching and then larry king shows them on tv and
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:51.960]  says it's flying saucers and then says i'm a conspiracy you know they say
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:55.080]  we're conspiracy theorist when we say it's government blimp's i mean
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:09:57.880]  that's how dumb they think the public is
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:01.960]  is that why i wanted to let you know alex that it's anybody can plug into
[3:10:01.960 --> 3:10:06.120]  any search engine hAA high altitude airship and the first thing they're
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:09.160]  going to come up with is various aerospace companies who are
[3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:13.880]  manufacturing them no conspiracy sites know nothing just honest
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:17.320]  reporting by these agencies is right out there in the open you want to find out
[3:10:17.320 --> 3:10:21.320]  about it it's there i know but i'm glad you brought it up
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:25.800]  for those that don't know about it they should go check it out but why do you
[3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:29.400]  think larry king and abc as well i've seen
[3:10:29.400 --> 3:10:33.080]  newscast they make fun of it and show it and say they're cigar
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:37.160]  aliens and then that but then we're the conspiracy theorist for
[3:10:37.160 --> 3:10:40.280]  knowing it's a blimp i mean we've entered a new
[3:10:40.280 --> 3:10:42.760]  system where if you believe it's space aliens
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:46.120]  you're normal but if you know it's a homeland security blimp
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:50.280]  you're bad i don't understand how dumb they think the public is
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:54.680]  it's george orwell's double speak we're engaging in double speak every day
[3:10:54.680 --> 3:10:58.280]  and you have obama coming on tv every day just like a good
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:03.160]  fascist dictator to show us his face and let us know that he's there and he's
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:06.120]  looking out for us i mean i've never seen this actually with other
[3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:08.440]  presidents for sure they have their weekly radio
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:11.640]  addresses no that's not the american way the american way is to not have
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:14.760]  giant billboards with the leader and the one and the savior
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:18.440]  and have the leader constantly on tv's everywhere constantly talking to you
[3:11:18.440 --> 3:11:22.920]  no this is hit larry absolutely absolutely and i don't know if anybody
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:26.440]  else has noticed but the guys on tv every freaking day now
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:30.840]  every day or his lackeys are on the tv every day
[3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:36.280]  speaking for him i mean if this is not uh... equivalent to the hit larry in
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:40.040]  era uh... i don't know what it is i mean uh... you know but
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:44.040]  you know the dumb down public doesn't really know history anyway so
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:46.680]  it's scary i know i mean i mean when it's not
[3:11:46.680 --> 3:11:49.480]  the the way of freedom to build someone up is
[3:11:49.480 --> 3:11:54.840]  the savior president of the world the one the magic man i mean all of this
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:11:59.720]  crap and meanwhile he lies about everything but they've already bought in
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:03.320]  to feeling like he's their daddy and so they go i don't care if he's cheating
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:05.960]  me i like him good to hear from you appreciate your call

[3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:21.960]  uh... okay uh... you know alex i've been looking uh...
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:27.560]  high and low for for uh... bill that ron paul used to talk about
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:31.560]  um... a while back uh... that uh...
[3:12:31.560 --> 3:12:36.680]  they directed congress to um... give all the loans that cause the real estate
[3:12:36.680 --> 3:12:39.240]  bubble do you know where i could find that
[3:12:39.240 --> 3:12:43.320]  i know they were trying to pass a bill saying you've got to follow what the
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:45.880]  bill says but the original bill
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:48.680]  past october third known as the banker bailout
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:51.320]  let the bank secretly do whatever they wanted
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:55.080]  uh... so i didn't know they passed i don't think they passed that bill
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:58.040]  compelling them to spend the money properly but i remember hearing and
[3:12:58.040 --> 3:12:59.480]  seeing that the news
[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:01.600]  a few months ago
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:03.520]  i'm talking about something that uh...
[3:13:03.520 --> 3:13:05.120]  i heard ron paul say
[3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:06.520]  uh... years ago
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:10.680]  that they've passed before the bubble uh... really got going before the
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:14.000]  when the market real estate market was really hot
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:17.640]  uh... it uh... kind of force the mortgage companies to give out all those
[3:13:17.640 --> 3:13:21.000]  really bad long old yeah i don't know i don't know what you're talking about
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:23.120]  i'm just so i thought you were talking about
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:25.440]  the bills to make them spend the money
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:28.760]  on unplogging the bad mortgages which they claim was the problem that really
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:30.480]  is only a small part of derivatives
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:33.200]  uh... yes i forget the name
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:35.080]  of the specific law
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:37.240]  uh... but bill clinton did it
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:41.640]  uh... and uh... and that will act that was the investment act that was the
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:43.200]  uh... the the
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:46.560]  private home ownership in enabling
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:50.800]  act it's got some cheesy name like patriot act that yes he ordered fanny

[3:13:55.040 --> 3:13:56.520]  and basically ordered
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:00.880]  that the other private banks to do it and yes you're right
[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:05.200]  yeah i've been looking everywhere for everywhere for that i really wanna yeah i
[3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:06.920]  know bill clinton did that and uh...
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:08.040]  somebody old
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:11.160]  emails in a minute yes it yes it's real it's true that
[3:14:11.160 --> 3:14:13.720]  that happened in i think ninety six
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:17.080]  yeah in fact i've seen uh...
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:21.240]  this weekend i watched uh... dick morris give a keynote speech in florida
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:24.560]  before some neocon group and he was bragging that
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:28.120]  oh i accidentally in the one behind this yellow we know larry summers really
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:30.920]  ish but i i'm accidentally the one behind this case
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:34.560]  i said listen clinton we've got to get all these poor people houses
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:37.760]  and then clinton went and did this and it got out of hand
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:41.000]  so yes it is a lot you're right it is past thank you
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:44.720]  good point i can't keep track of all this my memory fails i can remember some
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:46.800]  things perfectly
[3:14:46.800 --> 3:14:50.440]  i can remember do on a leaf you know when i was five years old
[3:14:50.440 --> 3:14:51.920]  but i looked at the field
[3:14:51.920 --> 3:14:54.320]  but i can't remember the name of that act
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:58.040]  uh... but it's something about
[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:01.920]  private home ownership investment i i i forget
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:05.640]  some sums it's got a really sappy name as soon as we will find it
[3:15:05.640 --> 3:15:11.640]  uh... let's talk to josh in california josh you're on the air
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:13.440]  yes josh welcome
[3:15:13.440 --> 3:15:15.280]  hi how are you doing
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:18.640]  uh... pleasure to be on the program uh... i'm a big fan of yours have been a
[3:15:18.640 --> 3:15:22.520]  listener for a long time i'm a put prison plan a subscriber and i agree with
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:25.480]  uh... just about everything that you talk about and uh...
[3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:29.640]  done control uh... global warming the fraud everything
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:33.400]  i uh... didn't want to bring up though on how you know you're you're mentioning
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:34.720]  sometimes
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:38.520]  about uh... some of the people that have issues with some of the things that you
[3:15:38.520 --> 3:15:40.000]  discussed on the air
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:43.040]  and um...
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:44.480]  used to have uh...
[3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:48.120]  what what happened like um... used to have warren coca rulo
[3:15:48.120 --> 3:15:51.080]  on the program and he became a no-pointer
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:54.080]  so i don't i haven't heard him on the program for a while
[3:15:54.080 --> 3:15:58.320]  but i was wondering why why is it that you don't discuss
[3:15:58.320 --> 3:16:00.520]  movies like september clues
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:02.880]  which i think are really important movies
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:06.080]  about nine eleven and never ever talk about it
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:08.840]  because i think it's pure ball i mean you know i'm not here to put out this
[3:16:08.840 --> 3:16:11.800]  info but i mean i did and that doesn't mean that i don't make
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:13.920]  mistakes
[3:16:13.920 --> 3:16:16.400]  but i think something's absolutely crap
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:20.120]  i'm not going to promote it on my show but i appreciate your call uh...
[3:16:20.120 --> 3:16:22.840]  you want to say mean things about people i guess i will
[3:16:22.840 --> 3:16:27.200]  but again why are people obsessed with personalities
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:32.720]  in the huge c of people that disagree with official stories
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:36.440]  i mean i'm i'm at warren coca rulo who's does some great music
[3:16:36.440 --> 3:16:39.320]  uh... at a nine eleven thing two thousand six item on the show i think
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:41.000]  twice
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:45.440]  uh... and people sent me info about warren which is a very colorful character
[3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:47.180]  also the least and i thought
[3:16:47.180 --> 3:16:50.560]  maybe i need to uh...
[3:16:50.560 --> 3:16:53.600]  you know look at this guy and and then he starts saying there's no planes
[3:16:53.600 --> 3:16:55.160]  heading and all the get all these
[3:16:55.160 --> 3:16:58.200]  phone calls for them and stuff and i mean that's not what i'm into
[3:16:58.200 --> 3:17:00.160]  so i'm busy
[3:17:00.160 --> 3:17:02.760]  but just because you know here's my back on the show doesn't necessarily mean i
[3:17:02.760 --> 3:17:03.560]  don't like them

[3:17:32.360 --> 3:17:33.500]  griff haven't gotten him yet
[3:17:33.500 --> 3:17:37.200]  because he's actually contacted us first without plugging
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:38.920]  the movie places
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:42.880]  but i mean see how i got all this news all this info all these collars
[3:17:42.880 --> 3:17:45.200]  and it's
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:48.440]  i mean my experience with no planers was like
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:17:51.440]  people look like they were drunk screaming and yelling dancing around half
[3:17:51.440 --> 3:17:52.160]  naked
[3:17:52.160 --> 3:17:55.040]  vomiting on street corners in front of news cameras
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:17:58.840]  what of what look like a set up to make nine eleven truth look bad so i was
[3:17:58.840 --> 3:17:59.440]  like
[3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:01.240]  well these are some serious people
[3:18:01.240 --> 3:18:03.680]  then they would attack me i want well they're really serious
[3:18:03.680 --> 3:18:06.200]  and then i would see ridiculous cg's
[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:09.520]  you know like as jokes of video game planes hitting buildings and saying look
[3:18:09.520 --> 3:18:10.840]  it's fake
[3:18:10.840 --> 3:18:12.920]  and i mean and then i know people
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:14.960]  people have known for decades
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:18.160]  who were working in new york that you know saw at least one of the planes
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:21.600]  and they don't know you didn't see those you're a liar your government agent
[3:18:21.600 --> 3:18:24.880]  and then you call a real friendly all why don't you believe no plane said alex
[3:18:24.880 --> 3:18:25.440]  i
[3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:27.640]  understand why you're doing this alex
[3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:30.960]  hey it's a free world talk about everywhere else you got to call in
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:34.200]  you got to talk about it again this is the mental illness though
[3:18:34.200 --> 3:18:36.520]  because this is what we're going to lose folks
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:38.000]  that's why we may lose
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:41.560]  is because it's all about alex and it's all about
[3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:43.840]  the peanut gallery like this is junior high
[3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:47.040]  this isn't junior high folks i got stacks of news in front of me where they're
[3:18:47.040 --> 3:18:48.040]  telling kids
[3:18:48.040 --> 3:18:51.120]  it's the law they've got to take vaccines nationwide
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:53.880]  and they're hurting the kids and shooting them up with vaccines that we
[3:18:53.880 --> 3:18:57.200]  know are deadly and we know are soft-kill weapons
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:00.840]  there is no law you gotta take those vaccines they have a regulation
[3:19:00.840 --> 3:19:03.840]  that state health departments recommend
[3:19:03.840 --> 3:19:07.000]  that to be in school you take these vaccines
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:09.960]  and the school says it's the law and never even tells you
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:12.520]  there's a waiver to the non-law
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:14.640]  that they have to give you by law
[3:19:14.640 --> 3:19:17.080]  to let you in the school
[3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:20.240]  but we're not going to talk about that we're not going to go out and warn
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:22.760]  people about what we know
[3:19:22.760 --> 3:19:27.240]  is going on god forbid
[3:19:27.240 --> 3:19:30.520]  i mean i feel like i have a responsibility to to
[3:19:30.520 --> 3:19:32.440]  to warn people
[3:19:32.440 --> 3:19:34.440]  i feel like i have a responsibility
[3:19:34.440 --> 3:19:36.920]  to reach out to people and tell them in fact i'm gonna do that we're taking a
[3:19:36.920 --> 3:19:40.240]  few more calls i'm gonna do a big news blitz and boy is it huge

[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:57.680]  it's a psychological excuse not to take action on other issues
[3:19:57.680 --> 3:19:58.720]  okay
[3:19:58.720 --> 3:19:59.840]  and to not

[3:23:04.640 --> 3:23:08.000]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:11.360]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:14.400]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:17.440]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:20.160]  even happen again so our friends at solutions from
[3:23:20.160 --> 3:23:23.840]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:27.360]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[3:23:27.360 --> 3:23:30.960]  an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:34.320]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in
[3:23:34.320 --> 3:23:37.360]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:41.920]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:22.880]  ever break it down properly or really cover it all but
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:27.760]  let's go ahead and go into it now it's from the atlanta journal constitution
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:31.360]  bob bar wrote this california gun decision
[3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:36.320]  muddy second amendment waters and it says uh that
[3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:39.840]  the on april 20th decision the ninth circuit court of appeals in the case of
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:43.680]  alameda county california has already muddy the second amendment picture
[3:36:43.680 --> 3:36:47.600]  clarified by the heller decision the circuit court did this by holding
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:50.640]  that the county government may prohibit firearms anywhere on property owned by
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:56.480]  the county including gun stores and facilities owned by the county
[3:36:56.480 --> 3:37:01.360]  so just absolute nightmare on that front uh i already told you this i mean it's
[3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:03.600]  not hard to know this people keep emailing me
[3:37:03.600 --> 3:37:07.200]  all week see obama's gonna get bush for torture
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:10.480]  if we put enough pressure on i mean it won't be because of obama he's trying
[3:37:10.480 --> 3:37:14.400]  to block and protect bush just like bush protected bill clinton this is how
[3:37:14.400 --> 3:37:17.760]  this is the deals they they give each other so they can commit crimes be
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:22.640]  protected by the next executive officer uh but um
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:27.440]  obama rejects truth panel commission would have investigated abuses and
[3:37:27.440 --> 3:37:31.280]  terrorism fight and this was north korean torture
[3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:34.960]  techniques used against our troops to make them confess the things they hadn't
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:38.160]  done and it came out the white house memos they wanted
[3:37:38.160 --> 3:37:40.400]  fake confessions and that's what these are for
[3:37:40.400 --> 3:37:44.720]  torture isn't good for real intel it's good for terror and fake confessions
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:50.560]  and it's continuing just a massive story folks massive story all over the
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:54.240]  country from schenectady new york to tennessee

[3:38:10.240 --> 3:38:15.200]  dps us marshals merge this is a arizona republic story and it just says they
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:17.440]  all work together and work out of the same building and
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:22.480]  are under the same command federal command with a 1.6 million
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:25.920]  uh federal department of homeland security grant
[3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:29.680]  federalizing everything i don't you know totally criminal totally illegal
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:34.400]  total tyranny like the soviet union taking over you know the
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:37.920]  it's satellites i mean that that's what's happening

[3:38:42.640 --> 3:38:45.840]  look obama's repealing it says right here a new system
[3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:49.920]  of national id through the state driver's license but the feds will pay for it
[3:38:49.920 --> 3:38:52.560]  the argument they're saying was over the states didn't want to pay for it that
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:56.320]  was only part of it so the feds are saying okay we'll pay for it
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:39:01.040]  total federalization so worse but the public's emailing me telling me that
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:04.000]  they're stopping it if you like being a schmuck and a sucker and
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:07.600]  being bamboozled being taken for a ride and being scammed and go ahead and not
