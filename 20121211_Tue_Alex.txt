[00:57.940 --> 01:03.340]  America is accelerating you've got the globalist controlled unions fighting
[01:03.340 --> 01:08.700]  with the globalist controlled corporations all in basically a pre-engineered
[01:08.700 --> 01:13.860]  Higelian dialectic of problem-reaction solution we're going to be breaking that
[01:13.860 --> 01:18.380]  down today it's all up at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com
[01:18.380 --> 01:24.380]  drudgereport.com is updating as things move or watching that as well we are
[01:24.380 --> 01:29.620]  union tempers flair and Michigan State House to protest right to work bill
[01:29.620 --> 01:34.180]  teachers call in sick only seven percent of Detroit eighth graders
[01:34.180 --> 01:40.780]  proficient in reading yeah and you look at numbers around the country they're
[01:40.780 --> 01:46.420]  similar in many areas and it's all by design that's what centralized federally
[01:46.420 --> 01:50.980]  controlled education is done and I've had the former head of policy at the
[01:50.980 --> 01:54.420]  Department of Education on the broadcast she's released the documents
[01:54.420 --> 02:02.220]  charlotte littlefield is or be and we need to give her a call is it little
[02:02.220 --> 02:05.700]  field there's another little field and I always mix it together the point is
[02:05.700 --> 02:13.140]  we're going to get her back on the broadcast here very very soon also we
[02:13.140 --> 02:20.220]  need to get today into 2012 and yesterday I said I would get to it but I
[02:20.220 --> 02:24.500]  kind of got flustered and and and overly tired by the end of the broadcast
[02:24.500 --> 02:29.220]  yesterday that happened sometimes and I didn't get to it but I will cover it in
[02:29.220 --> 02:33.020]  the shower 10 reasons why it's not the end of the world as we know it media
[02:33.020 --> 02:37.260]  indulges in debunked hysteria while ignoring real crisis say a Paul Watson
[02:37.260 --> 02:41.580]  Alex Jones article very important and we're going to be going over the facts
[02:41.580 --> 02:47.820]  of that while I'm fresh in the first hour we're joined by dr. Russell Blalock
[02:47.820 --> 02:55.380]  MD to give us his take on what Obamacare is going to do to our society now that
[02:55.380 --> 02:58.140]  it's going into place and what it's already doing to the medical field that
[02:58.140 --> 03:03.260]  he predicted and then we're also going to look at Alzheimer's being one of the
[03:03.260 --> 03:07.580]  biggest causes being the statin drugs themselves that literally dissolved the
[03:07.580 --> 03:13.500]  brain and the fact that first person I ever heard 15 years ago writing and
[03:13.500 --> 03:19.380]  talking about coconut oil and Alzheimer's was dr. Blalock brain surgeon and now
[03:19.380 --> 03:23.700]  it's mainstream news so I thought we'd get him on about some real solutions on
[03:23.700 --> 03:27.140]  that front and more in the third hour today in fact I had him on about the
[03:27.140 --> 03:30.380]  coconut oil and about Alzheimer's and about some other issues we sent him an
[03:30.380 --> 03:33.540]  email so he knows we're also going to first get into Obamacare for the first
[03:33.540 --> 03:38.140]  part of the interview because when it comes to an expert on it he certainly
[03:38.140 --> 03:45.660]  is he also writes for Newsmax.com so that is coming up today with dr. Russell
[03:45.660 --> 03:51.660]  Blalock we will have open phones in the second hour maybe even in this hour but
[03:51.660 --> 03:55.460]  I'm going to try to have a focus I always try and always fail but I'm getting
[03:55.460 --> 04:00.860]  closer to it every day to take a lot of your calls in the second hour of the
[04:00.860 --> 04:07.660]  transmission there's a lot of news on the economy there is a big news story

[08:07.380 --> 08:30.500]  we are live ladies and gentlemen on this Tuesday the 11th of December 2012 in
[08:30.500 --> 08:37.660]  some time zones the planet Earth only has nine days until the Sun blows up or
[08:37.660 --> 08:44.140]  Nibiru Planet X hits us or there's a pole shift or Comet Wakuku hits us or
[08:44.140 --> 08:49.380]  until a giant wing and snake comes out of the ocean and devours the earth I am
[08:49.380 --> 08:54.020]  not one of those voices promoting that and never have been but I will get into
[08:54.020 --> 08:57.740]  a detailed breakdown and angles you probably haven't heard on this the rest
[08:57.740 --> 09:02.020]  of the story coming up here momentarily I said I'd get to this article
[09:02.020 --> 09:08.380]  yesterday but I didn't properly and so at the bottom of the hour I will cover
[09:08.380 --> 09:12.460]  in detail ten reasons why it's not the end of the world as we know it media
[09:12.460 --> 09:17.140]  indulges in debunked hysteria while ignoring real crises so from our deep
[09:17.140 --> 09:21.420]  research we'll give you what we believe the real threat is and that is the
[09:21.420 --> 09:27.860]  globalist predatory power-lusting elite engaging in all forms of very
[09:27.860 --> 09:32.620]  dangerous pure scientific research looking for ultimate power to be able to
[09:32.620 --> 09:35.580]  dominate the globe of course these globalists haven't discovered the real
[09:35.580 --> 09:42.100]  power is knowing themselves and controlling themselves so all of that
[09:42.100 --> 09:48.340]  is coming up I want to obviously get into what's happening with the unions as
[09:48.340 --> 09:51.620]  well I want to get into the fiscal cliff and where our economy is going I'm
[09:51.620 --> 09:57.220]  going to cover that momentarily also I've gotten a threatening letter from
[09:57.220 --> 10:02.780]  the city of Los Angeles I'll tell you about that and show that to you as well
[10:02.780 --> 10:08.100]  Obama is expanding the free Obama phone campaign with federal money to the
[10:08.100 --> 10:13.140]  states and so we're going to be breaking that report down also but being
[10:13.140 --> 10:19.820]  posted by Paul Watson at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that is just some
[10:19.820 --> 10:23.460]  of the news we're going to be breaking here also we have a report at info
[10:23.460 --> 10:28.780]  wars.com 99% of Syrian rebels are Islamic extremist and jihadist
[10:28.780 --> 10:35.620]  terrorist and this is now a major think tank breakdowns and even the New York
[10:35.620 --> 10:41.980]  Times having to admit this so unbelievable information see we told
[10:41.980 --> 10:45.500]  you so but it's kind of better sweet so what have we told you so it just keeps
[10:45.500 --> 10:52.580]  moving forward briefly on the unions I'm going to play this coming up in the
[10:52.580 --> 10:56.980]  second hour and while we're taking your calls Democrats threatened violence on
[10:56.980 --> 11:01.940]  Michigan House floor state representative Douglas a
[11:01.940 --> 11:06.900]  jealous I guess you pronounce that now there will be blood or geese how do you
[11:06.900 --> 11:11.700]  pronounce guys the zeitgeist there will be blood state representative
[11:11.700 --> 11:16.140]  Douglas geese threatened from the House floor the Michigan House
[11:16.140 --> 11:20.420]  representatives today as the body debated legislation would make Michigan
[11:20.420 --> 11:25.540]  the nation's 24th right to work state well it's the only chance Michigan's got
[11:25.540 --> 11:29.980]  and I'm going to explain that here in just a moment I mean it's if you're part
[11:29.980 --> 11:36.540]  of the union that sells you out to get a one-time pension bailout and then they
[11:36.540 --> 11:45.500]  ship the jobs to China Eastern Europe and to Brazil it's pointless you see it's
[11:45.500 --> 11:50.700]  a very complex issue people ask me am I pro-union or I or am I anti-union and
[11:50.700 --> 11:56.580]  and on most issues I'm very very clear about where I stand because you can
[11:56.580 --> 12:01.700]  delineate it quickly and easily second amendment right to keep my arms first
[12:01.700 --> 12:05.100]  gun laws were against black people by the Ku Klux Klan in the south after the
[12:05.100 --> 12:09.740]  Civil War the areas that restrict guns have the highest crime rates you're
[12:09.740 --> 12:13.660]  always going to have violence especially in a frontier swashbuckling culture like
[12:13.660 --> 12:17.780]  the United States therefore don't take my right
[12:17.780 --> 12:22.500]  you know if somebody else steals a jelly donut don't make me do push-ups for their
[12:22.500 --> 12:27.980]  crime to use the full metal jacket analogy that's what authoritarian systems
[12:27.980 --> 12:34.660]  do but when it gets down to unions it's more complex the robber barons had
[12:34.660 --> 12:40.500]  taken over the government by 1900 they were making people work 20 hours a day
[12:40.500 --> 12:43.860]  and not even paying them in some cases and children were starving to death
[12:43.860 --> 12:48.820]  people were falling into sausage machines if you know famously is reported
[12:48.820 --> 12:55.660]  in the jungle back when we had real journalists and we're being turned into
[12:55.660 --> 12:59.860]  sausage and they would say just keep the machines going the Rockefellers would
[12:59.860 --> 13:06.460]  sell milk that was 1% milk and the rest of it was powdered chalk the police
[13:06.460 --> 13:12.300]  would go and shoot anyone in Chicago New York and cities like that or Houston for
[13:12.300 --> 13:17.180]  that matter or Galveston that was a big mega city at the time or New Orleans if
[13:17.180 --> 13:24.140]  if you so much as was rude to the mayor if you were rude to the mayor they
[13:24.140 --> 13:29.540]  would just come kill you there were gangs around government that they would
[13:29.540 --> 13:33.420]  just order to go beat up and kill anybody they wanted and the robber barons
[13:33.420 --> 13:38.420]  people started fighting back all over the country and and and the Rockefellers
[13:38.420 --> 13:42.300]  would send in Pinkerton security with gatling guns the machine gun
[13:42.300 --> 13:50.380]  everybody this type of stuff was going on big time at a massive level you guys
[13:50.380 --> 13:56.580]  shut that door for me thanks that doors just got an issue now where it's where
[13:56.580 --> 14:00.060]  the audio is just blasting in there the hole in the wall or something I don't
[14:00.060 --> 14:03.420]  know what it is but anyways getting back to what I was saying getting back to
[14:03.420 --> 14:10.100]  what I was breaking down all of this all of this was going on and happening go
[14:10.100 --> 14:16.300]  read the history understand it and so people organized into unions and they
[14:16.300 --> 14:25.100]  had cases all over the country where they would send in the the army to to
[14:25.100 --> 14:31.540]  shoot strikers they would I mean this went on until the 30s they would send
[14:31.540 --> 14:37.700]  in the military to kill and attack troops who weren't paid their pension funds
[14:37.700 --> 14:44.980]  Douglas MacArthur and also Eisenhower were two young army colonels that followed
[14:44.980 --> 14:47.820]  those criminal orders to do that and despite the fact that they were good
[14:47.820 --> 14:51.460]  men compared to globalist today they were elevated because they were willing
[14:51.460 --> 14:55.740]  to go in and ride down and beat the death and kill a bunch of veterans who
[14:55.740 --> 14:59.380]  were camped out on the White House lawn in other areas but the point is is that
[14:59.380 --> 15:05.100]  unions were founded and formed to say hey workers are going to organize so you
[15:05.100 --> 15:09.980]  don't have the lowest common denominator and it helped create a boom in this
[15:09.980 --> 15:15.980]  country to a great extent now fast forward to the 50s and the 60s we got
[15:15.980 --> 15:22.860]  Bilderberg group documents out of the private archives given us in DC and we
[15:22.860 --> 15:28.940]  checked that the hundreds of pages a few dozen of were actually public already
[15:28.940 --> 15:33.340]  and we confirmed these were the private papers of a US senator back in June we
[15:33.340 --> 15:38.260]  went to Bilderberg we were given it by a federal archivist and with similar
[15:38.260 --> 15:42.020]  documents have been released before and it was the senator's private papers at
[15:42.020 --> 15:48.700]  Bilderberg meetings in the 50s and 60s and the union heads were all there the
[15:48.700 --> 15:52.300]  United Auto Workers the United Steel Workers and they were there hey how do
[15:52.300 --> 15:58.420]  we get rid of the unions while fooling them and so you have to understand the
[15:58.420 --> 16:03.700]  Bilderberg group wanted to get rid of unions but they said we'll use them to
[16:03.700 --> 16:08.740]  socialize and collectivize America to to basically bring in federalization of
[16:08.740 --> 16:13.140]  worker laws claiming that's going to protect people instead of the unions
[16:13.140 --> 16:18.900]  themselves and then we'll get the unions to be mainly social groups and that's
[16:18.900 --> 16:23.420]  why we've seen the Steel Workers Union the Auto Union call for open borders call
[16:23.420 --> 16:27.700]  for their jobs being shipped to Mexico and China call for the federal government
[16:27.700 --> 16:34.060]  to nationalize things so the unions since the 60s became anti-gun anti-family
[16:34.060 --> 16:39.500]  anti-liberty organizations where they took the union dues and used it for open
[16:39.500 --> 16:44.500]  borders gun control globalism NAFTA and GATT were supported by Clinton and a
[16:44.500 --> 16:49.660]  bunch of the unions that's like saying please blow my head off yeah there it
[16:49.660 --> 16:53.940]  is leaked Bilderberg documents nationalism is dangerous and it goes
[16:53.940 --> 16:59.100]  through it and the main obsession in these Bilderberg minutes not just the
[16:59.100 --> 17:01.860]  senator's handwritten notes but the the sheets they were given in these
[17:01.860 --> 17:06.980]  meetings was how to take over and wreck the unions from 1966 but also other
[17:06.980 --> 17:12.660]  years and these are you know national security stamped not to be released from
[17:12.660 --> 17:20.040]  the National Archive this these senators private papers okay so the issue is the
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.980]  globalist don't want unions the way they were so people say well our unions good
[17:24.980 --> 17:30.420]  or unions bad it's more sophisticated than that it's like saying Alex for you
[17:30.420 --> 17:33.700]  for civil rights well yeah I'm for civil rights not the ones they tell you about
[17:33.700 --> 17:38.500]  where they ban free speech federalize the churches and then teach anti-family
[17:38.500 --> 17:44.260]  anti-human anti-culture globalist culture garbage in the schools and turn
[17:44.260 --> 17:48.700]  women against men and men against women and sexually confused children as part
[17:48.700 --> 17:51.940]  of a social engineering that's not a real civil right a real civil right is not
[17:51.940 --> 17:56.900]  having a private fellow reserve over me running my life now the union since the
[17:56.900 --> 18:02.620]  70s undoubtedly making the transition in the 50s and 60s become a force of
[18:02.620 --> 18:09.100]  globalism in their own destruction and corruption and stealing the dues and not
[18:09.100 --> 18:14.540]  opposing offshoring of jobs so the globalist before could have large
[18:14.540 --> 18:18.800]  numbers of poor immigrants coming in the 1850s through the 1900s when the
[18:18.800 --> 18:23.260]  unions developed around that time around 1900 they started getting stronger they
[18:23.260 --> 18:28.180]  could bring an unlimited third world labor to drive down wages and it got to
[18:28.180 --> 18:32.420]  a you know robber bear and people falling in sausage machine people starving
[18:32.420 --> 18:37.100]  to death JP Morgan riding around whipping people if he felt like it in the
[18:37.100 --> 18:40.620]  street with a bullwhip stomping you know stomping people to death in the
[18:40.620 --> 18:44.660]  street just foaming at the mouth big giant guys with guys with guns with huge
[18:44.660 --> 18:49.380]  black top hats just killing whoever they want sending in the army sending in
[18:49.380 --> 18:54.020]  Pinkerton Rockefellers ruling everything beating people to death going into
[18:54.020 --> 18:58.180]  mining towns machine gunning everyone blowing children's heads off burning
[18:58.180 --> 19:01.700]  churches down with people inside of them I mean that's where the unions came
[19:01.700 --> 19:06.180]  from as people trying to get organized okay people died for that that was a
[19:06.180 --> 19:11.980]  good thing and no one's it's gone after the unions properly today now unions are
[19:11.980 --> 19:14.940]  globalist loyal opposition to sell everybody out and now that the
[19:14.940 --> 19:18.740]  country's deindustrialized falling apart they're gonna lobby and call for
[19:18.740 --> 19:23.940]  government handouts and Obama phones and to tax the middle class okay now
[19:23.940 --> 19:27.300]  they're just a government client group that's gonna beg for free handouts on
[19:27.300 --> 19:30.460]  average a lot of their workers are good people and know it's a scam but they
[19:30.460 --> 19:34.700]  can't control where their donations go where their dues go yeah the Ludlow
[19:34.700 --> 19:40.340]  massacre there's many examples of this in Colorado so you have to know the
[19:40.340 --> 19:46.540]  history now the US is being turned into a third world country now they're gonna
[19:46.540 --> 19:50.380]  use the unions to just not let you have a right to work or your own business and
[19:50.380 --> 19:54.940]  then force you to hire government little spoiled rotten minions they're gonna use
[19:54.940 --> 19:58.580]  this to unionize and shut down small business I'll explain it when we get

[24:08.620 --> 24:15.780]  Pentagon have now released reports that read like the Alex Jones show and again
[24:15.780 --> 24:18.900]  I'd like to give myself credit I'm just reading what the globalist the Club of
[24:18.900 --> 24:22.660]  Rome say we know everything they're going to do we just don't know how
[24:22.660 --> 24:25.860]  they're gonna phase it all in in what order because they don't know they're
[24:25.860 --> 24:30.660]  always adjusting their program that's coming up superhuman super cities and
[24:30.660 --> 24:36.660]  supercomputers US intelligence vision 2030 from Russia today up at info wars
[24:36.660 --> 24:40.900]  dot-com and drudge report dot-com and it goes on most plausible worst case
[24:40.900 --> 24:46.100]  scenario the report ads involves the risk of interstate conflict increasing to
[24:46.100 --> 24:49.780]  the point that the US draws inward and globalization stalls from their mega
[24:49.780 --> 24:54.860]  cities will flourish and take the lead in confronting global challenges see see
[24:54.860 --> 24:57.860]  this is very sophisticated I'm gonna get to it after the break let me just give
[24:57.860 --> 25:02.860]  you this tidbit HD Wells wrote about it a hundred years ago they also wrote about
[25:02.860 --> 25:07.180]  atomic weapons forty four years before they were used oh technology is more
[25:07.180 --> 25:16.980]  advanced than they're telling you they also wrote about how globalism is to
[25:16.980 --> 25:22.500]  destroy the nation states and then destroy all the commerce between them
[25:22.500 --> 25:29.020]  and then only have highly compact mega city reservations where the advanced
[25:29.020 --> 25:33.940]  technology and life extension is used so it's going back to a city state
[25:33.940 --> 25:39.260]  neo feudal model where there is a global enforcer army over the once nation
[25:39.260 --> 25:43.860]  states and then city states operate under globalist control they're also
[25:43.860 --> 25:48.340]  gonna have a rural command basis and they're going to that and you're asked
[25:48.340 --> 25:51.580]  well how do they engineer that well they exempt themselves and then they tax you
[25:51.580 --> 25:57.820]  and then they social engineer that way it's like forging a sword in a in a in a
[25:57.820 --> 26:04.660]  blacksmith furnace I mean it's it's a science and they've got all our money and
[26:04.660 --> 26:08.500]  our work and our energy they can do whatever they want as long as we can
[26:08.500 --> 26:14.660]  fly all right that's coming up I'm already getting into it
[26:16.020 --> 26:21.860]  getting back to the union situation you got a bunch of hard-working on average
[26:21.860 --> 26:25.980]  union workers as I mean I've researched it and people working on those auto
[26:25.980 --> 26:30.300]  plants they're working hard the others this there's this there's either this
[26:30.300 --> 26:35.780]  demonization of unions this pure demonization that it's totally bad and
[26:35.780 --> 26:41.100]  wrong or there is a call for communism from a lot of people in the unions so
[26:41.100 --> 26:45.060]  there's either a total communist move or there's a total get rid of all unions
[26:45.060 --> 26:51.580]  move when there aren't unions these unions are all propaganda arms delphi
[26:51.580 --> 26:56.580]  technique Ford Foundation Bilderberg group run I've got the documents I just
[26:56.580 --> 27:02.060]  sourced them last segment and they've turned them into a social movement where
[27:02.060 --> 27:06.100]  the unions now get government exemptions on healthcare they get little
[27:06.100 --> 27:09.380]  government pension handouts while they're being destroyed now the government
[27:09.380 --> 27:15.820]  takes 50% away but leaves them with 50% and they are basically a social army now
[27:15.820 --> 27:22.020]  well the unions admit it they lobby for illegal aliens they lobby
[27:22.020 --> 27:27.060]  for restricting our guns they lobby for open borders they lobby for globalism
[27:27.060 --> 27:31.060]  and they lobby for shipping with jobs overseas they lobby for splitting their
[27:31.060 --> 27:36.860]  own throats and now it's a divide and conquer where the federal government is
[27:36.860 --> 27:40.700]  saying well we're going to come in and by the way it's in the news today what I
[27:40.700 --> 27:45.420]  told you how the government is coming after your IRA and 401k plan that's all
[27:45.420 --> 27:52.380]  in the Obamacare and as they devolve the society as they shut down the jobs as
[27:52.380 --> 27:56.380]  they put in the carbon taxes by fiat as they shut down the power plants and
[27:56.380 --> 28:00.620]  increase the power prices their answer will be we know it's rough there's a
[28:00.620 --> 28:04.300]  government program and that government program is given to select insider
[28:04.300 --> 28:09.900]  globalist corporations to hire you through government waivers of taxes
[28:09.900 --> 28:14.940]  regulations to where no one else can operate but it won't be a union anymore
[28:14.940 --> 28:21.140]  it'll be called a union it'll be collectivized insider globalist agenda 21
[28:21.140 --> 28:27.900]  style programs and the people will have less and less but all they'll know is
[28:27.900 --> 28:31.940]  the unions the reason they've got that job and they're living in a 250 square
[28:31.940 --> 28:36.180]  foot agenda 21 building and it'll and it'll segue to where they're not even
[28:36.180 --> 28:40.540]  gonna have jobs soon they'll just live in government housing and then have a
[28:40.540 --> 28:45.100]  government auxiliary job in femacor and this is all being announced where you go
[28:45.100 --> 28:49.580]  out 20 hours a week and community organize and tattle on people and maybe
[28:49.580 --> 28:53.780]  go pick crash up or dig out of a ditch and it's just an army of government
[28:53.780 --> 29:00.720]  zombies from the great union creators 120 years ago they stood up to the
[29:00.720 --> 29:04.660]  robber barons now totally kept creatures of the robber barons I'm gonna
[29:04.660 --> 29:09.060]  get in Bilderberg minutes from 1954 that they released themselves to BBC they
[29:09.060 --> 29:12.940]  think you're so dumb I'm more than 15 years ago that went public reading
[29:12.940 --> 29:18.620]  Bilderberg documents we've gotten from the National Archives going over all of
[29:18.620 --> 29:23.940]  this you see the model and see it's a long-term game when we come back I'm
[29:23.940 --> 29:26.860]  gonna play you this clip of this state rep in Michigan saying there will be
[29:26.860 --> 29:32.460]  blood and but just under and then I'll get into all the other news in 2012 but
[29:32.460 --> 29:38.540]  you've got to understand me and you've got to listen to me carefully on this the
[29:38.540 --> 29:42.580]  unions aren't gonna save you and aren't gonna do anything but also those that
[29:42.580 --> 29:46.980]  are purely attacking unions they're globalist but they use offshore labor to
[29:46.980 --> 29:53.940]  destroy the union so it's easy we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[33:27.460 --> 33:33.900]  day to that for one chance just one chance to come back here and tell our
[33:33.900 --> 33:43.180]  enemies that they may take our lives but they'll never take our freedom rallying
[33:43.180 --> 33:53.060]  patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones we're back I'm
[33:53.060 --> 33:56.340]  gonna get into 2012 but first I'm gonna get into some other top stories and open
[33:56.340 --> 34:00.220]  phones than dr. Russell Blalock's joining us on key when I say key
[34:00.220 --> 34:05.020]  information life and death information we're gonna get into Obamacare first
[34:05.020 --> 34:10.620]  but then into the statin drugs and more with dr. Russell Blalock finishing up
[34:10.620 --> 34:15.700]  with the unions let's go ahead and go to this clip of the state rep guys saying
[34:15.700 --> 34:19.740]  there will be blood here's that clip we're going to pass something that will
[34:19.740 --> 34:27.820]  undo a hundred years of labor relations and there will be blood there will be
[34:27.820 --> 34:34.580]  repercussions we will relive the battle of the overpass okay we will relive the
[34:34.580 --> 34:40.420]  battle of the overpass okay so here's the deal when back when the unions got
[34:40.420 --> 34:44.420]  in all these fights with the robber barons 70 80 90 a hundred years ago and
[34:44.420 --> 34:50.500]  back going back over 120 years really or more the China didn't have a billion
[34:50.500 --> 34:54.980]  300 million people and more factories than us and all the new coal plants they
[34:54.980 --> 35:00.100]  want Mexico didn't have 120 million people in it and 30 million here so it's
[35:00.100 --> 35:04.940]  150 million people Mexico had like what less than 10 million people let me
[35:04.940 --> 35:10.940]  explain something to you the globalist killed labor relations the globalist
[35:10.940 --> 35:14.780]  killed you the globalist took you over you're like at your great great
[35:14.780 --> 35:21.020]  grandmother's grave you never met talking about how you know somebody just
[35:21.020 --> 35:24.140]  killed her five minutes ago and you want to dig up the skeleton and you know
[35:24.140 --> 35:30.300]  dress her up in a wedding dress it had been dead a long time dead already the
[35:30.300 --> 35:34.020]  globalist cuts your arms and legs off you've bled out you're just now
[35:34.020 --> 35:38.700]  realizing you're about to die politically and your answer is I mean look
[35:38.700 --> 35:42.340]  at the unions say open the borders they admit that's their new job that's the
[35:42.340 --> 35:47.460]  new client will be political operatives for hire to the globalist who took you
[35:47.460 --> 35:53.780]  over and then they're not even gonna need you soon it's I mean the unions have
[35:53.780 --> 35:58.340]  been lobbying for bringing foreign trucks in so so I mean truck drivers have
[35:58.340 --> 36:01.980]  been making a good living for decades especially owner operators working
[36:01.980 --> 36:07.660]  their butts off hard work now with the Mexican trucks all over the US on the
[36:07.660 --> 36:12.100]  last few years guess what the wages have gone down massively and I know truck
[36:12.100 --> 36:17.660]  drivers but I can see the statistics oh there's no union for that is there no the
[36:17.660 --> 36:26.220]  unions lobby for it and now they're gonna just be a political army as they
[36:26.220 --> 36:30.740]  start to drown in debt they're gonna say government will do whatever you say just
[36:30.740 --> 36:34.700]  give us a check give us a job and the globalist will then give taxpayer money
[36:34.700 --> 36:39.740]  to select corporations so the union people can sit around all day and and
[36:39.740 --> 36:43.700]  maybe go beat you'll beat up some libertarian Ron Paul supporters all over
[36:43.700 --> 36:47.740]  the country Ron Paul supporters that set up the Tea Party six years ago the
[36:47.740 --> 36:52.140]  media said it was founded four years ago no the Tea Party was a patriot thing
[36:52.140 --> 36:55.820]  set up by Ron Paul myself and others 911 truth there's actually the first to
[36:55.820 --> 37:00.140]  start it seven years ago and it got taken over by the Republicans and just turned
[37:00.140 --> 37:03.980]  into this big anti-union thing so you know Ron Paul events here come the union
[37:03.980 --> 37:08.060]  people to try to beat folks up and the cops are union most the time in those
[37:08.060 --> 37:12.780]  cities so they just stand back and let it happen to that's my biggest problem
[37:12.780 --> 37:16.860]  the unions is they just become these political gangs where you know police
[37:16.860 --> 37:20.820]  people fire a cop who shoots somebody in the back or fire a cop who beats up a
[37:20.820 --> 37:24.780]  five-year-old and then the union gets them reinstated and overturns the police
[37:24.780 --> 37:29.260]  chief as if the police chief doesn't even exist on the planet you know why
[37:29.260 --> 37:35.340]  police have gotten so bad in this country the unions the old days it wasn't
[37:35.340 --> 37:38.460]  perfect but they didn't want a super bad name in most cities they'd fire bad
[37:38.460 --> 37:42.140]  cops because they didn't need the bad name and the liability now the unions
[37:42.140 --> 37:46.740]  run everything I've seen unions when you've seen them defend police when
[37:46.740 --> 37:51.740]  they're doing things that are unbelievable unions come out you know in
[37:51.740 --> 37:54.900]  that case in LA where the cop Colcox the woman because just because she
[37:54.900 --> 37:59.460]  questions him on the bus and knocks her down they're like well that's reasonable
[37:59.460 --> 38:04.300]  the union comes out and says well yeah this guy I got beat to death but that's
[38:04.300 --> 38:12.140]  reasonable so unions have just become gangs that's all they are now are there
[38:12.140 --> 38:16.580]  some little ones that do a good job yeah sure overall is it some time a check
[38:16.580 --> 38:22.260]  and balance on arbitrary stuff yes but they want to use unions now to come in
[38:22.260 --> 38:28.420]  and to basically reverse states that have gone right to work but they don't
[38:28.420 --> 38:32.780]  they don't actually bring in a real union they just bring in more regulation
[38:32.780 --> 38:37.180]  more control so that regular businesses can't compete with the unions so it
[38:37.180 --> 38:41.500]  just wrecks all the competitiveness see you're competing with Chinese labor
[38:41.500 --> 38:46.460]  forces that go and chain their children by the millions this is on the news you
[38:46.460 --> 38:52.180]  can type in children chain to lamp post in China and they chain them there the
[38:52.180 --> 38:56.660]  children use the bathroom right there and if they get enough money because a
[38:56.660 --> 39:01.100]  lot of the Chinese workers get paid daily they come out and get one meal and
[39:01.100 --> 39:05.060]  they go live in cardboard boxes that are now we that's how about a third of
[39:05.060 --> 39:08.500]  the population lives in Mexico half the Mexico City population lives in
[39:08.500 --> 39:15.780]  cardboard boxes it's such toxic waste down there that more than a third of the
[39:15.780 --> 39:19.380]  children born in Mexico City are born with a syndrome I forget the name
[39:19.380 --> 39:23.220]  without a brain all they have is the brainstem and the mothers take care of
[39:23.220 --> 39:27.420]  the babies you know usually about five or six they die they don't ever walk they
[39:27.420 --> 39:33.060]  never talk they're just blobs a third of the children some neighborhoods more
[39:33.060 --> 39:36.180]  than half of them oh you don't ever hear about that on the news from the
[39:36.180 --> 39:43.060]  liberals do you you see because it's all fake environmentalism just to get your
[39:43.060 --> 39:46.180]  house get your farm shut down your business so how are we going to compete
[39:46.180 --> 39:49.700]  when there's no environmental rules in China their rivers catch on fire every
[39:49.700 --> 39:54.460]  few days where where they put melamine and toxins in the food how are you going
[39:54.460 --> 39:58.180]  to compete with Mexico see it's because those are globalist made deals with
[39:58.180 --> 40:04.860]  authoritarian regimes to just paddle to the metal you can go buy you know a
[40:04.860 --> 40:11.660]  shovel for $5 you can go buy high quality steel knives for $10 no one can
[40:11.660 --> 40:17.620]  compete with that you can't pay for the insurance on your employee and make a
[40:17.620 --> 40:22.980]  knife for $50 we are paralyzed by bureaucracy and you find out it's all
[40:22.980 --> 40:27.460]  by design because the globalist own India own Mexico own China own Bangladesh
[40:27.460 --> 40:32.540]  own all these places with zero regulations on themselves or their
[40:32.540 --> 40:39.460]  workforce lives in plastic bags and boxes and they bust them in or train them
[40:39.460 --> 40:44.780]  in and there's huge cesspits outside the factories where humans go and just
[40:44.780 --> 40:55.140]  squat in giant piles huge oceans you can pull this up of of of excrement that's
[40:55.140 --> 41:02.020]  what you're competing against walls of flies walls walls in third world
[41:02.020 --> 41:05.660]  countries where you go out it's a windy day and the sky is brown with human
[41:05.660 --> 41:13.700]  excrement blowing soylent green mega cities and that's the unions were going
[41:13.700 --> 41:18.860]  we're gonna we're gonna burn something we're gonna be blooded and Jamie Foxx
[41:18.860 --> 41:23.900]  is going yeah the black people are taking over haha yeah whitey you're gonna
[41:23.900 --> 41:28.340]  get it Obama's black he's black he's black he's black I mean here's Obama
[41:28.340 --> 41:32.780]  running worldwide eugenics against Africans forced abortions global death
[41:32.780 --> 41:36.260]  total control and you got somebody dancing around about how they're winning
[41:36.260 --> 41:39.940]  just like the unions think they're winning when Obama got in oh yeah let's
[41:39.940 --> 41:44.260]  see how things go for you Obama's been a union buster from the start that's his
[41:44.260 --> 41:48.420]  job but he doesn't bust them completely he hands them over to the Annenberg
[41:48.420 --> 41:52.180]  challenge he hands them over to the Rockefeller Foundation where over a
[41:52.180 --> 41:56.140]  decade you get your pay cut and more than half then you lose your job but
[41:56.140 --> 42:00.780]  still the unions your friends so you go to them and they'll get you some they'll
[42:00.780 --> 42:04.060]  get you a college loan for some retraining for a job that isn't gonna
[42:04.060 --> 42:13.780]  exist so what do you do we're dead already we're dead but you see we're not
[42:13.780 --> 42:18.380]  an individual we are a system and the phoenix can always rise as soon as you
[42:18.380 --> 42:22.740]  reject the new world order as soon as you reject collectivism as soon as you
[42:22.740 --> 42:27.100]  reject big government because big government was created to domesticate
[42:27.100 --> 42:31.420]  you and it's all public Club of Rome Bilderberg CFR they all write books on
[42:31.420 --> 42:34.660]  it like you're an animal that can't read talking about what they're doing to you
[42:34.660 --> 42:37.900]  talking about how they're poisoning your food and water talking about how
[42:37.900 --> 42:41.260]  things are going well with the cancer rate now they're killing you talking
[42:41.260 --> 42:44.860]  about how they do all this to you and I'm sitting here telling you they're
[42:44.860 --> 42:49.300]  doing all this to you the unions are going to run around and call for more
[42:49.300 --> 42:53.800]  taxes because they want their welfare all all the unions are going to be as
[42:53.800 --> 42:57.580]  welfare agencies that organize the welfare hordes that's it and the
[42:57.580 --> 43:01.620]  illegal aliens oh the union got an illegal alien who hadn't worked in
[43:01.620 --> 43:06.700]  years they got him a kidney and the illegal alien gets up in the Chicago
[43:06.700 --> 43:11.980]  Tribune yesterday and says that's not enough I want more I want all the
[43:11.980 --> 43:16.180]  medication paid for and I want all the other legal aliens to get their free
[43:16.180 --> 43:24.020]  kidneys really of course it isn't a free kidney it's taxpayer money to that
[43:24.020 --> 43:29.220]  hospital hundreds of thousands of dollars you see how that works and and as
[43:29.220 --> 43:33.660]  soon as the and the illegals literally are so arrogant now there will I don't
[43:33.660 --> 43:38.460]  get DWI's I'm God I get free kidneys I can have 80 million dollars sent to my
[43:38.460 --> 43:42.820]  Austin house that you know that came out illegal aliens six seven people live
[43:42.820 --> 43:45.620]  in the house getting 80 plus million dollars and there won't be a criminal
[43:45.620 --> 43:49.740]  investigation nobody'll get in trouble because they're obviously laundering the
[43:49.740 --> 43:54.420]  money out to megabanks and that's back in the news it's a criminal free-for-all
[43:54.420 --> 43:59.740]  with a bunch of baby union people while your union heads call for NAFTA and GATT
[43:59.740 --> 44:03.500]  and Al Gore and Bill Clinton who you love so much because he comes and speaks
[44:03.500 --> 44:09.300]  to your unions and sits there and talks to you like your children it's a joke
[44:09.300 --> 44:17.060]  it's a total joke I said I'd get to 2012 we'll have to do it at the start of the
[44:17.060 --> 44:20.180]  hour I don't do this on purpose and then we'll go to your calls I just you know
[44:20.180 --> 44:22.500]  I'm a talk show host though that doesn't need to take the calls thank you
[44:22.500 --> 44:27.060]  notice that I'm so passionate that I will sit here for three four five hours
[44:27.060 --> 44:30.660]  pouring everything out of me with my brain going a million miles an hour and
[44:30.660 --> 44:34.140]  then almost collapse at the end of the show I've noticed I've got to go lay down
[44:34.140 --> 44:38.380]  for 30 minutes or I'm dead if I go if I go lay down for 30 minutes to take a
[44:38.380 --> 44:42.340]  catnap I can work till 10 at night but people hit me right when I walk out of
[44:42.340 --> 44:46.140]  the studio and then it hits me and then I just shut down the rest of the day but
[44:46.140 --> 44:51.020]  I got so much to do so much to cover because I'm desperate to teach you what
[44:51.020 --> 44:55.060]  I know because the globalists told me how they were doing it but in public
[44:55.060 --> 45:01.140]  statements it's all public listen this is not my opinion we can beat these people
[45:01.140 --> 45:05.860]  if you want it if you'll admit the New World Order's real if you'll admit it's
[45:05.860 --> 45:09.900]  evil if you'll go research what they're saying about you their arrogance can
[45:09.900 --> 45:15.700]  bring them down you know people don't take government and powerful elites they
[45:15.700 --> 45:19.980]  don't take it personal with them because they feel powerless deep down inside
[45:19.980 --> 45:24.860]  you'll fight with your boss you'll fight with your neighbor you'll fight with your
[45:24.860 --> 45:29.740]  family you'll get angry at people at work but when government abuses you you
[45:29.740 --> 45:32.820]  don't take it personal let me tell you something when your little kid gets
[45:32.820 --> 45:37.860]  cancer chances are it's a combination of fluoride vaccines GMO least it is in the
[45:37.860 --> 45:42.860]  rodents you should take that personal when you lose your job and then it's
[45:42.860 --> 45:46.700]  offshore the unions are so dumb down they don't know General Motors took their
[45:46.700 --> 45:50.220]  money and moved to China because it's only been in the paper a few times and
[45:50.220 --> 45:55.700]  their little union chiefs don't tell them they are the unions have turned them
[45:55.700 --> 46:01.620]  into domesticated jellyfish who don't even know what planet they're on you see
[46:01.620 --> 46:07.980]  the general public not just union people they're like little weak emasculated
[46:07.980 --> 46:12.740]  chicken necks who waddle around and are just incredibly weak and the new world
[46:12.740 --> 46:16.020]  order did this to you you've been poisoned your whole life you've been
[46:16.020 --> 46:25.300]  bombarded with mind control your entire life and you need to admit they've done
[46:25.300 --> 46:29.900]  it to you you need to admit it and then you've got the systems even if you've
[46:29.900 --> 46:33.740]  been poisoned and are hurt if you flip on your human power potential your
[46:33.740 --> 46:37.260]  primitive programming you can get out of this but you've got to admit you're
[46:37.260 --> 46:42.180]  under attack and you got to deal with it once you're under assault once you
[46:42.180 --> 46:45.700]  understand that you could flip that switch right now with me today we can
[46:45.700 --> 46:49.660]  begin the end of the globalist you've got to stop being afraid of what your
[46:49.660 --> 46:52.740]  neighbors think you've got to stop being politically correct and you've got to
[46:52.740 --> 46:57.220]  reach down inside you and ask God to flip on the switch right now you can do
[46:57.220 --> 47:02.220]  it flip the switch with me and feel the humanity pour back into you a warm
[47:02.220 --> 47:09.140]  feeling a strong feeling because you're not junk God doesn't build junk and all
[47:09.140 --> 47:14.260]  of you come from amazing survivors and we're not meant to fall to the
[47:14.260 --> 47:19.220]  scientific tyranny we're meant to defeat it now let me get to the news ladies
[47:19.220 --> 47:23.420]  and gentlemen and it's big and it ties into the whole 2012 garbage where's the
[47:23.420 --> 47:27.020]  document can aim I'll just put the articles right there right here's where
[47:27.020 --> 47:34.300]  we're going right here okay here is an article out of the daily and it's big
[47:34.300 --> 47:38.420]  news on every talk station TV and people running in this morning telling me
[47:38.420 --> 47:42.820]  which is great but I always wonder why when it's our article no one is
[47:42.820 --> 47:47.980]  interested but when it's mainstream media it's like oh my gosh government
[47:47.980 --> 47:51.380]  officials are quietly installing sophisticated audio surveillance systems
[47:51.380 --> 47:54.740]  on the public buses across the country to eavesdrop on passengers according to
[47:54.740 --> 47:59.260]  documents obtained by the daily oh you obtained them well I'm not a competing
[47:59.260 --> 48:03.940]  with the daily I I just understand this this paradox plans to implement the
[48:03.940 --> 48:06.680]  technology are underway in cities from San Francisco to Harvard Connecticut
[48:06.680 --> 48:10.580]  Eugene Oregon to Columbus Ohio they're not planning to implement Austin had
[48:10.580 --> 48:14.420]  microphones and cameras on most of the buses 78 years ago Austin had
[48:14.420 --> 48:17.220]  microphones up on street corners hidden in street lights and fake
[48:17.220 --> 48:23.500]  transformers in 1998 under federal grants it's in my film police day 2000 let
[48:23.500 --> 48:33.340]  me continue here here is Paul Watson's article on this today talking surveillance
[48:33.340 --> 48:38.140]  cameras coming to US streets in tele-street systems now being installed
[48:38.140 --> 48:43.180]  with DHS backing and I have confirmed and I've got to climb up on one and get
[48:43.180 --> 48:47.020]  in one but we talked to the guy they've got microphones in them and these new
[48:47.020 --> 48:52.100]  smart street lights quote no when it's dark or when it's not are hooked into
[48:52.100 --> 48:56.060]  the cable box and they're using the cable system hooked into Homeland Security

[49:00.260 --> 49:05.340]  spectrum in tele-street system now being installed with DHS backing now
[49:05.340 --> 49:11.020]  that's May 14th 2012 actually Paul has a new article out on this today here's

[50:08.220 --> 50:12.940]  2006 and and I'm not up there saying oh look I broke it first aren't we big

[53:58.820 --> 54:15.060]  deterrent
[54:28.820 --> 54:49.700]  We are back live man, I am like multitasking during these breaks over and over again fighting
[54:49.700 --> 54:52.860]  and battling for liberty.
[54:52.860 --> 54:55.460]  Everybody needs to wake up out of their coma, okay?
[54:55.460 --> 55:01.420]  Everybody is in a drug induced TV head system where we just perch in front of televisions
[55:01.420 --> 55:07.620]  all day or perch in front of computer screens and don't do anything real.
[55:07.620 --> 55:12.940]  Now let me go over some of the news here for everybody because I just went over how these
[55:12.940 --> 55:18.340]  total surveillance grids are going into place everywhere.
[55:18.340 --> 55:22.340]  Well here's an article out of Russia today today.
[55:22.340 --> 55:32.280]  Superhumans, super cities and supercomputers, US intelligence vision of 2030 and it basically
[55:32.280 --> 55:36.980]  breaks down world government and they're just rewriting the Wired Magazine article.
[55:36.980 --> 55:40.540]  The most plausible worst case scenario the report adds involves the risk of interstate
[55:40.540 --> 55:45.540]  conflict increasing to the point that the US draws inward and globalization stalls.
[55:45.540 --> 55:46.900]  Globalization is designed to do this.
[55:46.900 --> 55:53.060]  From there megacities will flourish and take the lead in confronting global challenges.
[55:53.060 --> 55:58.620]  Megacities that cancerously feed and suck everything dry, that's agenda 21.
[55:58.620 --> 56:01.340]  That's what they've said they wanted to do since 1900.
[56:01.340 --> 56:05.540]  The rewilding except for their megacities and their high tech reservations.
[56:05.540 --> 56:10.860]  You will be outside of that taxed by them getting none of the technology.
[56:10.860 --> 56:17.740]  Any technology we're given is a trojan horse to microwave us, poison us, kill us and track
[56:17.740 --> 56:21.340]  us and control us as our little data slave trackers.
[56:21.340 --> 56:24.220]  Now here is the Wired Magazine report.
[56:24.220 --> 56:28.940]  Now they're just telling you, well again I told you about 17 years ago, hacking the
[56:28.940 --> 56:32.140]  human brain, the next domain of warfare.
[56:32.140 --> 56:34.820]  That's like telling you now we're going to invent automobiles.
[56:34.820 --> 56:43.580]  This is old news, this is old news, but it says that we're already able, the CIA to program
[56:43.580 --> 56:48.660]  its people, there's several articles on this where they have the passcode to computers
[56:48.660 --> 56:54.100]  but only when they're given a passcode and then we activate a memory area, well that's
[56:54.100 --> 57:00.740]  compartmentalization, that's assassin training, that's mind control, that's the born legacy.
[57:00.740 --> 57:05.860]  But people are like, oh that's just a movie, no, that movie's not a movie, that's exactly
[57:05.860 --> 57:07.140]  what they do.
[57:07.140 --> 57:15.380]  With viral trackers, viruses that eat areas of the brain, then they reupload viruses that
[57:15.380 --> 57:20.780]  then carry trojan horse control to reprogram, you're like, well how does that work?
[57:20.780 --> 57:27.820]  They've got a cat virus, excuse me, a cat microorganism that goes in and does similar
[57:27.820 --> 57:33.260]  things and reprograms the brain, and here they are admitting all of it.
[57:33.260 --> 57:37.380]  And what they're doing is with these flu vaccines and things we figured out from talking to
[57:37.380 --> 57:41.780]  scientists that went and looked at what's in them, is they've got nanotech trackers
[57:41.780 --> 57:48.820]  in them that are simulating and testing, just like you put ink into someone's bloodstream
[57:48.820 --> 57:54.940]  to test where the leak is or to test where the medicine's going, they are simply using
[57:54.940 --> 58:03.820]  viruses to go in and to track and then to have innocuous effects physically where it's
[58:03.820 --> 58:05.940]  not too noticeable.
[58:05.940 --> 58:09.980]  Before they really release viruses that reprogram the general public and turn us into the equivalent
[58:09.980 --> 58:14.620]  of biological androids, living zombies, they need to test it out first and that's going
[58:14.620 --> 58:15.620]  on.
[58:15.620 --> 58:22.980]  Undoubtedly, we've got sections of that admitted and it goes over how they've got the fifth
[58:22.980 --> 58:26.900]  domain of mind control, and they say it's new though, so they're just introducing that
[58:26.900 --> 58:28.980]  to all the slaves out there.
[58:28.980 --> 58:34.380]  Alright, when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, I'll get into more news and then the 2012
[58:34.380 --> 58:38.380]  and beyond, and then your phone call, stayweathersandfullwars.com.
[58:38.380 --> 58:50.780]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.780 --> 58:57.780]  Thank you very much for watching this video, and I'll see you in the next one.
[59:51.780 --> 01:00:02.780]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:10.180]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.180]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.340]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:21.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.340]  And by the way, we just joined us.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:38.840]  Who is funding the Pentagon and the military for all of the surveillance grids, microphones
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.340]  and buses and street lights?
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:46.840]  Oh, the Rockefeller Foundation, their global business network.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.840]  Just do things like they say, and magically you'll get media coverage and all the loans
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.840]  you need.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.340]  It's an organized global economy designed to destroy humanity for the globalist.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:02.840]  It is a smart takeover, smart growth, smart grids, all of it.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:08.340]  This is the type of garbage they're pushing.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:12.340]  In fact, here's the article about it by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.340]  You might think that it's important.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:24.340]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by the elite.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.340]  Rockefeller studies envisions future dictatorship controlled by the elite, and they call for the dictatorship.
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.340]  Oh, but it's a trendy liberal.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.340]  It's like when Obama drops bombs on your country.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.340]  It's liberal.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.340]  I mean, he's black and he's liberal.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:48.340]  I mean, you know, when Bill Clinton ships your jobs to Mexico and China, it's trendy.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:53.340]  I mean, you're not against the Chinese people, are you?
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.340]  And then all it does is drive up the cost of living in China.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:02.340]  Then they kick the farmers off their land and they make them go work at a Foxcom factory for Apple.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:06.340]  Their only hope is jumping off the top of the building to commit suicide, but that's too easy.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.340]  They put up suicide nets so they can't.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.340]  And farmers don't try to have a baby.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.340]  You're going to be aborted.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:20.340]  They're going to do monthly pregnancy test at Foxcom because they love you.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.340]  They're the loving government.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:25.340]  They're so loving and so good.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.340]  All those medical experiments on the children.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.340]  It was all so good.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.340]  It was all so loving and so helpful.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.340]  And they did it all just for you.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.340]  Because they were loving globalists.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.340]  They didn't want to run the world for power.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.340]  They wanted to run it to help you.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:50.340]  When we come back from break, I'm going to go over Watson and Eyes article.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.340]  Ten reasons why it's not the end of the world.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.340]  It's a very important article.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.340]  I'm going to read it and then it will be phones for the balance of the hour.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:03.340]  I tend to get in a really nasty mood as I realize that we were completely right about all of this,
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.340]  except that it's worse than we thought.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.340]  And it's all starting to come through.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.340]  It's all starting to accelerate.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:13.340]  And you've got a bunch of self-centered, gerbil-like, dumb-down,
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:18.340]  poisoned victims scurrying around, also self-centered,
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.340]  that they just care about acting cool in front of people
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:26.340]  and swithering around from different decadent events to different decadent events.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:30.340]  And they have no idea, and they're so cowardly deep down inside,
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:34.340]  they will never admit the scientific dictatorship is almost complete.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.340]  The Death Star is clear to fire in five minutes.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:42.340]  It's orbiting the planet at maximum velocity to use a silly Star Wars analogy.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:47.340]  And we need more X-Wings launched to get up there and take this thing out, man.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:52.340]  And you're going to have to wake up to it and admit we've been right.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:56.340]  See, the globalists have used my operation against the Liberty Movement.
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.340]  They'll use anything prominent against it.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:03.340]  And I've told you this, we're real, we're hard chargers, look at our fruits, huge awakening.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:09.340]  But they simply fired this info propaganda at us and tried to use our attacks against them
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:14.340]  as a modeling exercise of how to spin and how to titrate the dose
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.340]  and how to socially inoculate people to these horrors
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:24.340]  at a revelation of the methods subconscious race-memory interface level.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:28.340]  And, you know, I'm not here to just acclimate you to this.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.340]  I really don't want this plan to succeed.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.340]  I mean, you know, number one, I'm not going to sell out to the New World Order
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.340]  because I know it means destruction to my soul.
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.340]  Number two, you can't really sell out to them.
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.340]  That's a lie because they're insane themselves.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.340]  This will all come back on them. It's a universal law.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:49.340]  And I have a love of humanity, and I know we've got a greater destiny.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:54.340]  But still, it doesn't mean that what I take doesn't get twisted by enemy operations
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:05:20.340]  and uses a projection center to project their falseness on me.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.340]  This is the perfect tool.

[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:28.340]  All right, my friends, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday edition in the first hour if you missed it.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:33.340]  We broke down talking surveillance cameras coming to U.S. streets.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:38.340]  That ties into all the big breaking news of the streetlights with Homeland Security nationwide paying
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:45.340]  to have streetlights wired in to the local cable system to shoot video and audio of you and your family.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:50.340]  That's gone in all over Austin, Texas. Isn't even news, but it is national news.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:58.340]  We're going to be getting more into that. We're going to get into the latest economic news as well.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:08.340]  Also, California population is moving out since this report shows 100,000 more people moved away than the 3 million more illegal aliens that moved in last year.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:17.340]  And they're mainly moving to Texas. And listen, I know a lot of Californians, they're great people. It's a great state, very beautiful state physically.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:28.340]  But I've learned when people come up to me and tell me I've got too many kids, I've only got three, or when people step in front of me in line,
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:35.340]  or when people walk out in front of my truck, put their hand out, and then tell me that I've got too big a truck,
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:42.340]  I roll down the window. This has happened like five times, and I go, you just moved here from California, and they get mad and say, how do you know that?
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:48.340]  And Austin has been invaded. There are probably more Californians here now than Austinites.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:54.340]  It's doubled in size the last 10 years. They're mainly Californian. And they're just like, listen, we're taking your guns, we're taking your house,
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:10:00.340]  and we're going to jack up taxes, and we're going to put carbon taxes on you, and we're going to shut down all three of the city power plants.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:08.340]  They've already shut down two, and we're going to bring this city down. To the point of, I had to move outside Austin just to get away from some of their taxes.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:18.340]  But they, I mean, it is, I mean, so you've ruined California. You've tried your hardest, and now you're coming here. See, they just know they can't make it in California.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:23.340]  They don't know why. So they basically go bankrupt, and then they come here to make us go bankrupt.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:30.340]  They sit there and shoot holes in their boat, and then jump in my boat, and they're busy hacking it with a hatchet in the bottom.
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:36.340]  I'm like, stop it. Stop it. No, no. They're like, shut up. I actually had Californians. I haven't told this story yet.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:41.340]  I told Joe Rogan a little bit of it. So some of it's on tape, but I didn't finish the story. I'll tell the story and then get into 2012.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:48.340]  Then I'll give the number. I'll take your calls. But I take my son swimming at Barton Springs.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:53.340]  This is just a week and a half ago, still warm enough. And he goes, I want a hamburger.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:57.340]  So they've got, you know, organic beef and stuff at P Terries. Pretty good little hamburgers.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:04.340]  So I pull in in my Ford truck. No big deal. All around. It's a real busy day, and there's like 20 people at the walk-up window.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:14.340]  You've got to drive around in front of the walk-up window in that porch area right there to, you know, to, you pay, then you drive around and then you get the food.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:23.340]  So I pull up and I'm stopped. This is just one of these stories and I pay the lady and I'm sitting there and then I start driving at about a half mile an hour.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:33.340]  And this woman with another woman and a man steps out in front of me and I don't hit her, but she goes, hey, and slaps the front of my truck.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:42.340]  And I decided to turn the other cheek. That's my first default. She walks around and I'm rolling to go around and I say, hey, I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:52.340]  She goes, watch how you drive next time. And I went, I went, okay. So I start rolling the window and she goes, and by the way, look at the size of this truck.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:12:00.340]  And I, I mean, my son saw it. He was a witness and I rolled the window and I said, excuse me. And I put the car in part.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:06.340]  And she's with this other woman and this guy and he's like, it's always this wimp type of things. They're tough kind of looking at you like, you know, I'm powerful.
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:13.340]  And the minute I would have gotten out of that guy would probably would have run. You know, these people, it's all about displaying not to see.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:20.340]  I don't display. I attack. You understand the difference and the, but I'm not looking for that. The point is I'm a sweetheart.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:32.340]  And I, but I'm a Texan and I'm sitting there and I go, you're from California, aren't you? And she goes, what? How do you know? And I went, oh, and I went, listen, lady, you stepped out in front of me.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:37.340]  And the other woman, now that I was talking back, the guy didn't dare say anything. He kind of started getting scared going.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:43.340]  And I, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, he's not going to let us just hand pack him and run over him because he was standing behind the women.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:49.340]  You could tell they were the bosses. And the other woman goes, hey, there's children here. They'll use the kids just every play.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:56.340]  But then I went, you're the ones slapping my car, getting out in front of my vehicle. You're the ones when I said I was sorry, getting in my face.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:05.340]  I said, look, you're not going to ruin and take over our state. And suddenly the whole line goes, I've lived here 10 years and I still hadn't got used to these Texans.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:15.340]  And I went, you're all from California. So I drive around because it's another five feet. There's cars in front of you as each car goes.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:22.340]  And all of a sudden folks go, yeah, we're from California. By the way, we like to show Alex and they start shaking my hand.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:28.340]  And the fact that they're so programmed in celebrity in California, the women and the guy freaked out and said, that's it.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:33.340]  This isn't safe. We're not getting the food and ran off.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:40.340]  They left because when they saw that I was a quote celebrity, it was like game over. They just, the color went out of their skin.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:47.340]  They were white, but they went sheet white. This happened. She white and just went, this isn't safe.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:56.340]  And left their hamburgers left the line because I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, man. Hey, that's okay.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:01.340]  Well, hey, it was actually you. What are you from California? How do you know that?
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:08.340]  You're, you know, imagine your cars too big. Oh, I forgot. It was worse than I said halfway through this.
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:13.340]  They start going, your truck, it's not safe. And I mean, it's not a monster truck. It's a Ford truck.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:18.340]  I mean, it's a King cab, but it's not that big. There's much bigger trucks.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:25.340]  And they're like, because there's this walkway and this porch and I'm like eight feet from them. It's where the cars are supposed to be.
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:29.340]  You know, it's you drive around it. It doesn't have seated dining on that one.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.340]  And these women are freaking out. They say there's children here.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:39.340]  And I was like, I wasn't talking to me. I'm like, man, what is going on, lady? You know, stuff like that.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:43.340]  They, as soon as everybody starts shaking my hand, we're from California, but we're not all bad.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:46.340]  We like your show. So I start shaking hands. A chain reaction happens.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:51.340]  Those women freak out with their man walking behind them. The men always walk behind their women.
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:55.340]  And you see these women, they walk around, they're in charge. They'll walk right up to you in a store.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:59.340]  What's that on your face? You know, to your kid, my son has a birthmark.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:02.340]  Boy, they saw him today. He was on the trampoline and ran into his sister.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.340]  And he's actually got a shot her today. They probably try to take him.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.340]  But the point is they'll march up to my wife. Why do you have three kids? They'll march right around.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:13.340]  They're just always in charge. You know, these women, they always look so unhappy.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.340]  And I can say, are you from California now? And they go, how do you know that?
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.340]  Well, you look super unhappy. Boy, you're living the feminist dream, aren't you?
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.340]  You're just in charge. You're just walking around. You're the boss. You're in control.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:30.340]  Nobody's going to tell you. You're going to slap my truck. Get watch where you're going.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:36.340]  Look at the size. I'm so sorry, man. Look at the size of that truck. That truck's not safe.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:39.340]  You're too close to us. Get back. Get back.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.340]  My truck has stopped with a car in front of me and I'm sitting there.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:46.340]  I mean, the whole story, I should have got it on tape.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:50.340]  It's a true story. I've got my dog killing a raccoon on tape.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:53.340]  You guys have seen it. I don't think I want to show it to you.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.340]  I tell you, I tell you, every day is an adventure.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:00.340]  And I know I got to get into 2012. Then I said, I'd give the number out and take your calls.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:07.340]  It's just that here's this article. California population is moving out, census report shows.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:11.340]  More people are moving out of the state than into the state and new census report shows.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:16.340]  And they come to the town where my mother was brought up or my parents went to college
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:19.340]  and they are just letting me know they will walk right up.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:23.340]  They're a man right behind them and just say, you listen to me.
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:26.340]  Oh, this is our country. We're taking it down and you will take it down.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:31.340]  I have no doubt you will run us into the ground. You will win.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:36.340]  And your bosses are putting this in the water feminizing the men hyper feminizing you.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:39.340]  You're so feminized, you know, you're dying of breast cancer and record numbers.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.340]  And it's just they're just murdering us in mass.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.340]  And they've got hyper females just everywhere dominating everything.
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:49.340]  But there's a good side effect. These women are on so many male hormones now.
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:54.340]  They're all out buying guns and they're actually going past fake feminism and, you know,
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:57.340]  becoming steroid commanders. So I guess in a way it's not that bad.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.340]  I mean, you know, I'm not threatened by that. I love women, by the way.
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.340]  I just watching the CIA experiment through Miss Magazine.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:07.340]  That's been declassified and how they've wrecked women and men.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.340]  You know, men are a bunch of arrested development, you know, weaklings acting tough.
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.340]  And then the women are just stormtrooping around or they're whoring around.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:20.340]  Oh, I love how feminism empowered women where they're just these one dimensional,
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:23.340]  two dimensional, you know, cutouts aren't even real people.
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:27.340]  And women think it's horrible to have kids and think it's horrible to have to take care of them
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:30.340]  and think it's horrible, you know, to do feminine stuff.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:35.340]  Oh, it's so horrible. But then they're totally unhappy on the psychological studies they've done
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:39.340]  because you're supposed to be a human. You're supposed to be complex.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:42.340]  You're supposed to be real, not watching TV all day,
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.340]  feeling inadequate because you're not Jennifer Aniston.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:51.340]  People are embedded in the false reality of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:55.340]  and it isn't real folks. I know a lot of big Hollywood people.
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:01.340]  They're miserable, miserable. The more sex, the more drugs, the more power,
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:05.340]  the more they live in seclusion, in prisons.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.340]  Unless there's somebody like the few conservatives who are out playing golf
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:13.340]  and helping charities and I'm not saying conservatives are perfect,
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:17.340]  they're at least a shadow of what humans are supposed to act like.
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.340]  But these people are miserable. You've been taught that you're not fulfilled
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.340]  because you're not a movie star.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.340]  So instead, you're going to be a feminist commando star
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.340]  who's going to let these Texans know that you're going to domesticate them
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:34.340]  and you're going to run them. And I think it's time for Texans,
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.340]  especially in Austin, to get back in the face of these Californians
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.340]  and say, look, you already tried to wreck your state.
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:43.340]  They already hit the escape pod on the state of California.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:48.340]  Don't come here. They call cops on people that have guns and gun racks.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.340]  Don't come here and tell, you know, people that they're abusive
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.340]  if they yell at their kid in the parking lot.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.340]  Don't come here with your social engineering garbage
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:01.340]  and your nanny state baloney. Don't come here and do it.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:04.340]  Do you understand that?
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:08.340]  You've destroyed your state to a great extent.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:11.340]  By the way, there are a lot of great people in California.
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:13.340]  They've just been overrun by that culture.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:18.340]  And it is sad to see, you know, Michigan falling into a hole
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.340]  because of big government. It's sad to see California doing it.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:25.340]  It's sad to see a great state like Illinois under globalist control.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.340]  I want you guys to fix your states.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:31.340]  Okay, I'm not in some tribalism where I don't have nobody who ain't from Texas.
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:34.340]  But let me tell you, it is annoying.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:40.340]  I've been at Barton Springs and actually just been quietly talking to someone about it.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:44.340]  Yes, actually, that's the American eel that lives in here.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.340]  You don't know that. Where are you from? There's no eels in here.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.340]  I'm like, are you from California, the woman?
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:52.340]  Well, yeah, how do you know that? Well, you don't like men talking.
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.340]  Well, I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk and I'm not going to walk behind you.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:20:01.340]  You got that? You got that Janet Reno? I'm red-blooded!

[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:04.340]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:07.340]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:12.340]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:16.340]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:22.340]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.340]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:07.340]  because you have a C-W-R emergency water filter.
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:13.340]  C-W-R environmental has been supplying emergency water filters worldwide for over 25 years.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:17.340]  The difference? C-W-R emergency water filters are portable, easy to set up,

[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:10.340]  Well, you were sleeping. They came and took it all away.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:18.340]  The Californians moved to Austin, and now they're gonna take your freedom away.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.340]  The place is where you used to live.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:23.340]  Now, there are a lot of great Californians.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.340]  It wasn't inside, just...
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:29.340]  In fact, a lot of famous people have moved here.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:33.340]  The reason the Californians are all moving here is I think there's more Hollywood people in Austin now
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:35.340]  than there is in Beverly Hills.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.340]  I mean, pretty much you just throw out a name. They live here.
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.340]  And they live here a lot of the time.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.340]  And again, I'm not here fighting with Californians.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.340]  It's that the Californians get in your face.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.340]  Texans are real polite on average.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:53.340]  But then a Texan will get back in yours like, they take it personal.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:58.340]  Hey, don't get in my face. It's just a Texas thing. It's the culture.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:02.340]  Somebody's rude to you. A Texan will usually put up with it one time.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:05.340]  And I'm sorry, partner. You come back at them again.
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:09.340]  They'll be like, you want to get in a fight? Is that what you're looking for?
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:12.340]  And really, it's American culture.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:17.340]  I mean, that's how it is in a lot of other areas of the country, like Oklahoma or Kentucky or Tennessee.
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:20.340]  Mainly rural areas where people are nice. They're friendly.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:24.340]  But they're not there to be run over and pushed around.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:32.340]  And it Californian culture was swashbuckling and hardworking and mining and ranching and as tough as it got.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:36.340]  It's been overtaken by the modern plastic corporate culture.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:40.340]  So that's not even Californian culture that I'm talking about.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.340]  It's globalist culture.
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:50.340]  Here's the toll free number to join us at 800-259-9231-800-2599-231.
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.340]  But when you sit there and they're in your face.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:58.340]  So I was pretty nice. I was like, even once I got smart mouth, I was like, what are you from California?
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:03.340]  Oh, you are. Oh, you're not going to take over our city. You don't run everything.
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:06.340]  Your truck is dangerous. There's children here.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:10.340]  I'm like, you're the ones talking. Oh, hey, how you doing? How you doing?
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:15.340]  Guys like, I've lived here a decade still haven't gotten used to these Texans.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:19.340]  And then later when I was getting the hamburger, he comes over and goes, I'm a listener. I'm from California.
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:23.340]  I didn't mean that mean. I even shook that guy's hand.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:29.340]  Yeah, I haven't got used to these Texans. What? You go to the bathroom all over them and they get mad?
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:34.340]  I mean, you hadn't got used to low taxes and guns and freedom and being left alone.
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.340]  Your neighbor helping you. Have you asked for help? But you hadn't got used to that?
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:41.340]  Oh, it's too much fun to make fun of Texans in the Hollywood culture.
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:47.340]  I'll take a Texan any day over some plastic globalist. Okay.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:53.340]  All right, I'm done on my rant. I just saw that article out of NBC, Los Angeles, and the money's all fling.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:58.340]  Everybody's fling that's got money out of France. It's going to go above 80% tax.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:04.340]  And then all the big mega billionaires are exempt, but the millionaire soccer players and people are like, I'm leaving.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:08.340]  People are leaving England because of the taxes. And that's why they want a new world order.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:12.340]  So there's nowhere for you to run with your money.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:15.340]  You work your whole life, save a couple of million dollars. They're going to take it.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:21.340]  And by the way, that's in the news today. It's here in my stack. I'll cover it after we take some calls.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:29.340]  Where mainline news they're announcing under Obamacare, they're going to tax all of the 401ks, all the pensions, and it's just getting started.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:39.340]  But it's only 3.8% a year bigger than any gains you're going to get nowadays on top of inflation.
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:46.340]  All right, I said I'd get into it. We're going to do it right now and then go to your calls 800-259-9231.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:52.340]  And we're going to be going to your calls after this break. I just can't ever seem to get to this report.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:28:01.340]  Let me just start reading it now. 10 reasons why it's not the end of the world as we know it.
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:06.340]  Media indulges in debunked hysteria while ignoring real crises.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:11.340]  Despite the fact that there are innumerable genuine crises and real economic problems all over the world,
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:17.340]  for which people should be making serious preparations, manufactured hysteria surrounding supposed Mayan prophecies
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:24.340]  about the end of the world on December 21st has dominated the headlines and stoked panic amongst significant numbers of people.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:32.340]  And now it's reaching favorite pitch. Here are 10 reasons that suggest December 21st will not herald the end of the world as we know it.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:43.340]  Number one, Doomsday adherents cannot seem to agree on precisely what catastrophe will befall the earth on December 21st.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:52.340]  Will it be the emergence of planet X or a combination of crippling global super storms and extreme weather events?
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:56.340]  I was going to Ted Knight voice whenever I read stuff like this.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:06.340]  Unlike Y2K, which at least was a single, qualifiable, quantifiable threat, the Mayan prophecy comes with no specific warnings attached,
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:10.340]  leaving it open to wild and inaccurate speculation.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:15.340]  Number two. So this is 2012 as read by Ted Knight.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:20.340]  Number two, astronomers and NASA scientist David Morrison
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:30.340]  put out a YouTube video containing deleted and detailed rebuttals of five separate apocalyptic scenarios on its website,
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:39.340]  including a meteor strike, a solar flare, and the so-called pole shift, whereby Earth's magnetic rotation poles would reverse.
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:49.340]  And if you don't believe NASA, there are millions of amateur astronomers who are constantly stargazing and would notice any celestial or threat will be back.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:56.340]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:41.340]  at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:44.340]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:05.340]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:13.340]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:19.340]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts. Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:22.340]  and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:25.340]  It is time to purify our family's water.

[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:24.340]  and I'll stop doing the Super Friends 10 Night Voice in a moment.

[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:54.340]  And here's somebody hang up is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:58.340]  Finishing up here, we talked to the warehouse.
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:09.340]  I talked to the warehouse and we have enough Pro Pure's to get them shipped out to you by Christmas if your order is in today.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:14.340]  And I will continue to have the 15% off through Friday and then it's gone for the year.
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:19.340]  It'll be gone for several months at least, our most popular water filtration promotion ever.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:25.340]  The stainless steel with stainless steel spigot has the fluoride filters, everything.
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:27.340]  It's what I use, what my family uses.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:31.340]  Pro Pure were the biggest seller of it, lowest price anywhere regularly.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:39.340]  Now 15% off the already lowest price at InfoWareStore.com and your purchase of the Pro Pure at InfoWareStore.com
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:46.340]  makes our operation possible so you get a great quality product and you support the transmission.
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:52.340]  Remember when you buy books, videos, t-shirts, all the materials, it helps wake others up and it helps funder operations.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:59.340]  Not only are the best books, the best videos, the best research I see out there, we end up carrying the best healthcare products you name it.
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.340]  We do the research, it's there for you.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:09.340]  InfoWareStore.com, InfoWare's health.com, InfoWare's team.com.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:16.340]  And we can still through about Friday and for some people even longer.
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:21.340]  We brought back the Alex Jones Everything Special, all of my films, what is that, more than 20 films
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:28.340]  including the new strategic relocation for $99.95.
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.340]  That is the lowest price ever, normally $379.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:35.340]  We only run that around Christmas and I haven't even plugged that yet.
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:38.340]  We just put it back up last week.
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:45.340]  You can get strategic relocation in all of my other films for $99.95 on DVD to have them in the higher quality
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:50.340]  and be able to have a hard copy of the globalist can't erase off the web and it supports our broadcast but at that price not much.
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:52.340]  It's about getting the word out.
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:57.340]  InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:00.340]  You can get your propure filter order in today.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:03.340]  You can still get 15% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:10.340]  We can also call and get that and then it's a little iffy but we're pretty sure anybody in the US will get it well before Christmas.
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:15.340]  It's just that soon we're going to sell out of them and the factory's going to have to make more.
[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:16.340]  It's getting close to that.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:23.340]  There's been such a run on these but you can get the propure water filters right now at InfoWareStore.com
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:29.340]  or 888-253-3139 and get 15% off with the promo code water15.
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.340]  You can also give InfoWareStore.com.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:38.340]  One membership for $5.95 a month is 10 memberships with the same username passcode.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.340]  10 people can log in so that's $0.59 per person a month.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.340]  We've never done something like that because I want to just get the word out.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:53.340]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWareStore.com takes about a minute to sign up, create a new username passcode and give it in e-cards to friends and family or physically and say,
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:37:00.340]  here's your documentary film, alternative news, website subscription, PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWareStore.com.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:03.340]  And it's all up there, all the new films and stuff for NHD.
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:07.340]  See the Daily Radio Show and the Nightly News Show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:11.340]  Didn't plug in the last hour so kind of double down in the shower.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:14.340]  Going over this, 10 reasons why it's not the end of the world as we know it.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:19.340]  Top astronomers are on record saying there is no Nibiru, there is no Planet X coming.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:21.340]  It would be giant in the night sky.
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:23.340]  The Mayans didn't even say that.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:24.340]  We've got links to that.
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:25.340]  It's totally made up.
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.340]  But they don't care.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:29.340]  They say it's a poll shift or the sun's going to blow up or a solar flare.
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:33.340]  Not that a solar flare couldn't hurt communications or even fry the earth.
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:37.340]  It's just that we don't know when that's going to happen or if ever.
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:44.340]  Sure, giant asteroids have hit before and caused a new ice age and darkened the sky for a thousand years.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.340]  But they don't know when that's going to happen.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:51.340]  Number two, astronomers and NASA scientist David Morrison put out a YouTube video detailing
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:56.340]  rebuttals of five separate apocalyptic scenarios on its website including Meteor Strike,
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:01.340]  a solar flare in the so-called poll shift whereby the Earth magnetic rotation poles were reversed.
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:06.340]  And if you would believe NASA, there are millions of amateur astronomers who are constantly stargazing
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:11.340]  and would notice any celestial threat to the Earth many weeks or months in advance.
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:15.340]  Number three, the establishment media and entertainment industry in the West has
[01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:19.340]  exploited the 2012 hysteria for their own commercial and tabloid-driven ends.
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:23.340]  Rest assured, you know it's fraudulent when the system itself is pushing it.
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:28.340]  Real threats to people's livelihoods like the derailing and the valuing of the dollar.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:35.340]  Food shortages and threats to private retirement funds including 401Ks and IRAs are all too real
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:41.340]  but not sexy enough to be turned into blockbuster Hollywood movies or primetime documentary specials.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:44.340]  Real threats to our environment like genetically modified food, chemtrails,
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:50.340]  or unstable nuclear reactors are sidelined in favor of obsessing over inane fantasies about Armageddon
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:55.340]  or saying carbon dioxide plants, pray this evil, pay Al Gore money immediately.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:02.340]  Number four, the Mayans themselves were not too smart as a culture in comparison to others
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:05.340]  so they didn't invent the wheel and sacrifice their children.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:09.340]  So why should we pay much attention to what they said anyways?
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:14.340]  The Mayans were incapable of inventing the wheel and see I wrote a lot of this some repeating myself.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:19.340]  I'm saying it before I read it, the wheel and thought that life was a dream of the gods
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:24.340]  which is why they routinely made human sacrifices to stave off the fear that the gods would awaken
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:28.340]  and the world would end because gods drink blood while they're sleeping obviously,
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:34.340]  as of the vampire gods. Why should we indulge in the same deluded fears of such primitive culture
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.340]  which they actually didn't even say that.
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:41.340]  So if you do think we should be paying attention to the Mayans,
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:46.340]  then they also includes Armageddon is some way off during a recent speech
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:53.340]  the National Council of Elders of Mayans, Zakan Grafuna, without pronouncing that right,
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:56.340]  pointed out the end of the Mayan calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:40:00.340]  noting that it merely represents the end of one cycle leading to the beginning of a new one.
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:05.340]  It is the time when the largest grand cycle in the Mayan calendar,
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:16.340]  1,872,000 days or 5,125,000 or 5,000, I don't know, years over turns and a new cycle begins.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:19.340]  The reason I can't news read is I get in a hurry because I want to go to your calls
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.340]  and then I just start butchering it and then it all slows down.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:24.340]  Let me just take my time and read this.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:29.340]  It is the time when the largest grand cycle in the Mayan calendar
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:42.340]  or 1,872,000 days or 5,125,37 years over turns and a new cycle begins
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:49.340]  notes Anthony Avini, a Mayan expert and astro astronomer at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:55.340]  Number six, the Mayan prophecies contain absolutely zero evidence that anything catastrophic
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:57.340]  will actually happen on December 21st.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:04.340]  The very few ancient texts that refer to December 2012 threat is a calendar milestone
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:11.340]  but do not contain prophecies of doom, says John Henderson, a professor of anthropology at Cornell University.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:14.340]  And by the way, they all agree it clearly says that.
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:21.340]  The Mayan leaders once exploited manufactured hysteria about the end of the world
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:26.340]  to make their inferiors follow orders, including give us our children for sacrifice.
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:30.340]  Possessing advanced knowledge of when solar eclipses would occur,
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:33.340]  the elders would claim that the snake was about to eat the sun
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:37.340]  and that only by obeying commands would the elders permit the sun to return.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:41.340]  Watching a subsequent solar eclipse, the peasants believed the scam
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:45.340]  thinking that the elders had divine powers to make the sun disappear,
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.340]  ensuring total obedience.
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:51.340]  Kind of like Al Gore and Bloomberg say you must pay them trillions in taxes
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:54.340]  because the hurricane was caused by global warming.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.340]  Okay, continuing.
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:01.340]  Most of the individuals whipping up frenzy are doing so by personal profit.
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:06.340]  In China, scam artists have been convincing pensioners to hand over savings
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.340]  and the last act of charity reports the Telegraph.
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:11.340]  Others have been selling end-of-the-world survival kits,
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:16.340]  a delicious contradiction in terms cashing in on the hysteria.
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:20.340]  Some people have used the suppose end-of-the-world 2012 as an excuse
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:23.340]  to make apologies for the very real tyranny
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:26.340]  that we see unfolding on a daily basis in a myriad of different ways.
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:30.340]  Armageddon hysteria has been hijacked as a useful psychological justification
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:33.340]  for laziness and procrastination when it comes to educating others
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.340]  or making personal preparations for genuine crises
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:39.340]  because the world is going to end anyways.
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:44.340]  And I would add there that it's very, very simple.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:48.340]  What we're dealing with here is that people say that government's
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.340]  digging bunkers and things and setting up checkpoints
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:53.340]  and stockpiling ammo because of this.
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:54.340]  No, governments have done that before.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.340]  They're doing it because they're far in bank run
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:58.340]  and they're about to drop the hammer on us.
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:02.340]  Number 10, many Christians have earmarked December 21, 2012
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:05.340]  as the date of Armageddon or the Second Coming of Christ.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:08.340]  However, this ignores the Bible itself, which quite clearly states
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:12.340]  that the end of the world will not be foreseen by man.
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:15.340]  No one knows the day or the hour when these things will happen,
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:18.340]  not even the angels in heaven nor the Son Himself.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:23.340]  Only the Father knows, states Mark 13, 32.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:26.340]  And the rest of the article is up there at infowars.com.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.340]  I'm going to have them repost this on the front page right now.
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:31.340]  We ask the webmasters, please, thank you, to repost.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.340]  Ten reasons why it's not the end of the world as we know it.
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:38.340]  And I will re-send this out as a tweet on real Alex Jones at Twitter.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.340]  So be sure and follow us there.
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.340]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.340]  I'm going to try to shut up.
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:46.340]  Just make your point and I'll make a short point.
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:49.340]  We'll go to the next person so everybody can get involved on air.
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:56.340]  Mike in Illinois, listening on WLUV 1520 AM.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.340]  You are on the air, Mike.
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:00.340]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:01.340]  Good.
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:05.340]  Well, I'm a union employee in Northern Illinois.
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:08.340]  We're basically screwed up here.
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:13.340]  I mean, the thing is, is the unions are fighting themselves.
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:17.340]  I was an operating engineer in the IVW,
[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:22.340]  but then the local 150 operating engineers started striking
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:24.340]  and they took my job.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:25.340]  So, I mean...
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:28.340]  But listen, I mean, you know the big unions are all run by the globalists.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:30.340]  We just showed the documents last hour.
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:32.340]  This is all a staged event.
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:34.340]  I mean, did you hear my take on that last hour?
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:35.340]  Yep.
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:36.340]  I've been listening.
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:37.340]  What do you think?
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.340]  What do you think?
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.340]  All right.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:43.340]  I mean, it's exactly to the T of what's happened.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.340]  It must.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.340]  And nothing else makes sense.
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:48.340]  And they're going to bust all the unions that are left,
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.340]  but Obama's going to play the part of the savior.
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.340]  Do you understand that?
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:55.340]  And then the unions will be purely turned into anti-American organizations
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:58.340]  and it's all manipulated by the mega rich,
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:02.340]  the robber barons who already shipped your jobs to China.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:06.340]  You know, I have a friend who's worked at UAW
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:10.340]  and I was talking to him and he has this propaganda
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:13.340]  that they were handing out there at the Chrysler plant
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:17.340]  and it was saying that if you vote for Romney,
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:19.340]  he's going to send your job to China,
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:22.340]  just like he did to other American companies like Hyundai.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:25.340]  And of course, he'll do that and so will Obama
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:27.340]  because they're bought and paid for by the same people.
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:29.340]  All the illusion of choice and people are saying,
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:30.340]  well, what are you pro union?
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.340]  I was pro union with it a hundred years ago,
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:35.340]  but we have the Bilderberg documents.
[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:36.340]  It's on record.
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:38.340]  They've been taken over since the sixties.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.340]  I mean, what do you think when you see union support
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.340]  NAFTA and GATT and stuff?
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:45.340]  I think the unions BS all around.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:46.340]  Exactly.
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.340]  I mean, they don't do anything.
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.340]  They do nothing like they say they're going to do.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:53.340]  But you can damn sure bet they're going to take your dues every month.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:56.340]  They don't worry that they're going to get an Obama phone.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.340]  I mean, I'm glad you started appreciate your call.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:00.340]  Please spread the word up there on 15, 20,
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.340]  and all our Illinois affiliates, our Chicago affiliate,
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:03.340]  just giant audience.
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:04.340]  Very exciting.
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:08.340]  Let's talk to Stephanie for closed homes.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:10.340]  And we'll talk to Brian Hassel for paying with cash.
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:13.340]  That's happening to me when you pay with a 20 now.
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:14.340]  I mean, they're like, what is this?
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:16.340]  That's all corporate ordered.
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:20.340]  Stephanie in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:21.340]  Hello, Alex.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:23.340]  And God bless you and the work that you did.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:25.340]  Well, thanks for putting up with me, ma'am.
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:28.340]  No, there's nothing to put up with and Ron Paul too.
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:31.340]  The question I have for you is national mortgage settlement.
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:34.340]  What is your viewpoint on that?
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:36.340]  Say that again.
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:40.340]  There's a national mortgage settlement program now for folks that were illegally
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:44.340]  sure foreclosed the one between January 08 December 11.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:45.340]  Sure.
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:50.340]  We've had a lot of mortgage experts in breaking down the different programs.
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.340]  There's a quite a few.
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:55.340]  A lot of times if you've, if they've robbed your home wrongly,
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:58.340]  then they give you a pittance, but it's just more bailout money.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:02.340]  Or if you're behind because they foreclosed on you wrong,
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:06.340]  they have you sign papers that waive your rights just so they can foreclose on you
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:07.340]  again in a few months.
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:09.340]  So there's a lot of different programs.
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.340]  What do you think of the program?
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:12.340]  I don't know which one you're talking about.
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:13.340]  Sure.
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:17.340]  I'm not sure how to advise folks on if they should participate or not to be honest with you.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:21.340]  The program that I'm speaking of is the one where they claim that the top five banks,
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:23.340]  that illegal foreclosures are in that period,
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:27.340]  and you are getting a check, a settlement, a big settlement.
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:31.340]  You know, what's happening is they've gone to all the attorney generals.
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:35.340]  They're getting state laws passed saying that mirrors and these other registries that
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:38.340]  lie and say they own your house, even when your house is paid for,
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:40.340]  and they come and take them.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:43.340]  They're just waving magic wands and letting them off.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:47.340]  But the precedent now, they're doing a thing where I saw that in the news a few months ago
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:51.340]  where they do give you a pittance payment to kind of set the precedent that they can
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:56.340]  take houses that they don't own and then the government pays you off.
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:58.340]  You know, I don't want to give you advice on that.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.340]  That is so complex.
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:06.340]  I would need to get the author of clouded titles on Mr. Krieger.
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:11.340]  I would need to get him back on and ask him that question or some of our other experts
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:16.340]  because I have studied it, but I conflate some of the different programs
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:19.340]  and I don't want to give you bad advice.
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:23.340]  These are for folks that have already lost their homes, just so you're clear on that.
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:25.340]  Yeah, these are people that have their homes wrongfully taken.
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:28.340]  The banks lied and said they owned the deed when they didn't,
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:30.340]  and you're being offered a settlement.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:33.340]  I mean, how big is the settlement versus how much the house was worth?
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.340]  Oh, God, nothing.
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.340]  It's like $850 minimum, maybe a couple grand.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:41.340]  Oh, yeah, no.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.340]  I mean, I personally wouldn't do that.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:47.340]  Look, the thing is, if you sue them, you've got standing, even if the courts are corrupt
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:51.340]  and they have to go through the procedures and it costs them tens of thousands.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:53.340]  So, I mean, I personally wouldn't settle for that.
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.340]  God bless you.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:56.340]  I appreciate your call trying to move quicker here.
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.340]  That's just terrible.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:01.340]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Connecticut.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:02.340]  Hassel for paying cash.
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:05.340]  He's listening on infowars.com audio streams.
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:07.340]  Go ahead, Brian.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:08.340]  Hello, Alex.
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.340]  I'm a big fan.
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:13.340]  I've been listening to you for two years, and you've woken myself up and my family,
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:17.340]  and I really appreciate all the work that you've done.
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:22.340]  Now, let me preface the saying that I've been to grocery stores and used a $50 bill
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:26.340]  and been to little stores, and they typically take out a little magic marker
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:29.340]  to verify that it's a real bill.
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:34.340]  Yesterday, I went to a liquor store here in town to purchase a 12-pack of beer,
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:40.340]  and I gave the woman a $50 bill, and she looked at me and said,
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:42.340]  we've got to move over to this register.
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:46.340]  You're paying with a $50 bill so the cameras can photograph you.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.340]  Alex, I was shocked.
[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:49.340]  No, no, no.
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:53.340]  Sir, the new status thing is to be police state,
[01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:55.340]  and so these people really get off on it.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:50:01.340]  When you get a hotel, a rent car, buy lawn equipment, everyone's spying on you.
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:04.340]  When the cable guy's in your house, you look over, you'll have a satisfied look.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:06.340]  He's a secret agent man.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:09.340]  We've got to come back from break with secret agent man,
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:12.340]  and there's no authoritarianism works.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.340]  Sir, this has happened to me.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:18.340]  They're now arresting people for paying with 50s when they're legal and lawful.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:21.340]  So, yeah, so how did this end?
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:26.340]  I muttered, so we really are in Nazi Germany, and she looked at me,
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:31.340]  and my God, she set something off,
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:34.340]  and that's when she told me to move over to this register
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:37.340]  and that we need your photograph because you're paying with a 50.
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:38.340]  Yeah, what I would have done is I would have said,
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:41.340]  give me my money back, and then I would have called the police
[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:43.340]  because they only care about who calls them.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.340]  So this woman's not giving me my 50 back.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:48.340]  I mean, you know, I want to hear how the story ended.
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:49.340]  Oh, I know, man.
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.340]  They're like, woo.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:52.340]  Look, look, the words gone out through,
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:56.340]  you know, your customer, the banks, like cash is bad.
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:59.340]  They banned cash in Louisiana, sir.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:00.340]  They banned it.
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:02.340]  We can buy GMOs stressed out about money
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:05.340]  and blasted by the electric environment.
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:09.340]  Hi, I'm Pastor Ginny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:11.340]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:15.340]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:18.340]  is actually packed with millions of gene switches
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:21.340]  that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs,
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:23.340]  and other tissues behave.
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:26.340]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease, decay, or decline
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:28.340]  like I'd been conditioned to believe.
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:31.340]  I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:33.340]  designed to turn on those switches
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:36.340]  and provide me with amazing health and joy.

[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:34.340]  That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:38.340]  that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:42.340]  Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:44.340]  to discover exactly what it is,
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:49.340]  plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.340]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online,
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:54.340]  so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:57.340]  Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:26.340]  When your kid skins their knee,
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:29.340]  when they're in your house,
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.340]  they're looking what's in your medicine cabinet
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:35.340]  when the plumber's working on your toilet.
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:38.340]  When you're on the bus, they're watching, listening to you.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:42.340]  Austin's got over a thousand microphones placed now.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:52.340]  Where I live, a secret agent.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:54.340]  They're never worried about the mega banks
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:56.340]  laundering hundreds of billions of drug money a year.
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:58.340]  They're never worried about the government kidnapping little kids
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.340]  and doing medical experiments.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:03.340]  They're never concerned about big banks controlling government
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:05.340]  going after their pension funds now,
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:07.340]  as they've already done in Europe and are starting here.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.340]  No, no, no, no.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:12.340]  The secret agents are all there to watch you.
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:15.340]  Oh, no, no, government. You don't investigate government.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:18.340]  It's above the law and your national security can do whatever it wants.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:21.340]  Its secret agent man's got to watch you.
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:25.340]  And I've actually paid for like, it was a few,
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:28.340]  it's happened a lot, it's been the last year, it's gotten really bad.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:31.340]  You'll be in a store, you're buying like $25 worth of stuff.
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:34.340]  You pull a 50 out and they'll go, what is this?
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:36.340]  And they'll put the thing and they'll say, is this real?
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:38.340]  And I'm like, it's got a strip in it.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:41.340]  But I go, no, but it's actually Federal Reserve note
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:44.340]  that took over the country. None of it's really real.
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:47.340]  And they'll say, well, I'm not going to take it then.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.340]  I go, look, sir, it's a joke.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:52.340]  The government issued that, but it's really a Federal Reserve note.
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:56.340]  See, they arrest people who use $2 bills now.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.340]  They arrest people at Walmart who use hundreds legally
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:02.340]  because they're all secret agent men.
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.340]  I've had a carpet cleaner at my house back before I had kids,
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:09.340]  had a shotgun on the wall in a gun rang.
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:11.340]  He went out, called the police.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.340]  They were able to stop it at the carpet cleaner place.
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:17.340]  Or they were able to stop him from doing it.
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:19.340]  This is America, folks.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:23.340]  They think everything's illegal and a lot of people love it now.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:26.340]  And they really get off on the secret agent behavior.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:29.340]  But the crack dealers literally down the street for me,
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:32.340]  a mile from me are crack dealers on the street corners.
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:34.340]  The cops drive right by.
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:37.340]  Oh, because there's no secret agent there. That's a real criminal.
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:40.340]  There's secret agents when they walk up and my son's got a birthmark
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:42.340]  and they say, did your daddy hit you?
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:45.340]  I'm like, hey, I'm right here. Are you from California?
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.340]  Okay, I'm not kidding.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:49.340]  They're like, yeah, none of your business.
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:51.340]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:53.340]  Sir, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:55.340]  Brian in Connecticut, how did this end?
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.340]  I want to hear the rest of the story.
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:00.340]  Well, you know what was strange, Alex, is that she didn't,
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:02.340]  when she took the 50 from me,
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:05.340]  she did not verify it with that little marker
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:09.340]  or whatever they do to make sure it's a real bill.
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:12.340]  She asked me to move over to the other register
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:14.340]  where the camera could get my picture.
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:18.340]  And when I went home and told my wife, my wife was livid,
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:20.340]  she wanted to go down.
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:22.340]  I had to restrain her from going down there
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:24.340]  and wanting to know who gave them...
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:27.340]  Listen, I would have said, listen, Mabel,
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:29.340]  hand that 50 over right now.
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:32.340]  Because I've had them freak out on the 50 and I just go, you know what?
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.340]  I don't need this stuff.
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:36.340]  I just leave the...
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:42.340]  They were trying to make me register a one-man kayak.
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:45.340]  And they all knew who I was at the academy.
[01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:47.340]  They're all, hey, Alex Jones, how you doing?
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:50.340]  And they go, all right, we got to register this state police policy.
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:52.340]  And I said, I don't want to register it.
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:55.340]  What if it gets stolen? I just said, I'm not going to register it.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:58.340]  You've got the serial number. If you want to go off and do it, that's fine.
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:00.340]  I'm not filling out where I live and what I do.
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:01.340]  They got a kayak.
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.340]  They said, we're not going to sell it to you.
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:06.340]  And I said, great, I'm leaving. Push the card nicely right there.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:10.340]  So the next person to get through, I turned it, said, see you later.
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:13.340]  And the manager ran over and said, no, no, Alex, it's okay. He can go.
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:15.340]  But they were watching me.
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:17.340]  They were watching me close.
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:22.340]  Wow, interesting story. Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:23.340]  He's gone.
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:25.340]  We'll take a few more calls and Dr. Blalock's coming up.
[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:27.340]  We're going to talk to Brian.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:28.340]  We were just talking to Brian.
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:32.340]  We're going to talk to Scanner and Josh and others.
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:35.340]  Well, whoever's been holding the longest, we'll go to Gina first.
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:40.340]  And then Sam, stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:10.340]  All natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:12.340]  earth-friendly and safe.

[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:26.340]  you're using now.

[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:33.340]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:38.340]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[01:59:38.340 --> 02:00:07.340]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:10.340]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:11.340]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.340]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:17.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:27.340]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:32.340]  Basically, what bureaucrats are doing and all this henpacking through the corporate structure
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:37.340]  is they want to see how much they can get you to do, how many orders they can follow.
[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:40.340]  They can put you in jail for $2 bill.
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:41.340]  It's totally legal, awful.
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:42.340]  They'll do it.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:47.340]  If they can forcibly inoculate your kids, felonies each time they do it, they'll do it.
[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:51.340]  If they can give little kids, you know, live syphilis injections, they'll do it.
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:54.340]  And then announce it on the news and not get in trouble.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:01:01.340]  So it's a process of the criminals beating us into submission, trying to break our will.
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:03.340]  TSA, that's what all of it is.
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:05.340]  The globalists have psych warfare manuals that are public.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:06.340]  It's all a big joke to them.
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:08.340]  Well, I got news for you, scum.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:12.340]  You may think the rest of the public are animals and you're going to run over them.
[02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:14.340]  You don't have a legal or lawful right to do this to me.
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:15.340]  I'm sentient.
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:16.340]  I'm smarter than you are.
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:20.340]  And we're going to expose you and you're going to be brought to justice, okay?
[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:26.340]  I declare in front of the whole universe and God, I am not your property and I declare war against your attacks.
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:28.340]  Okay?
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:32.340]  The ancient right to resist being oppressed and overrun by scum.
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:34.340]  I call you out.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:41.340]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gina in California or no, she's in Nevada talking about Californians because I brought up the Californians.
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:44.340]  They'll just walk up here in Austin and command you.
[02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:46.340]  They'll tell you you have too many kids.
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:48.340]  They've told me my truck's too big.
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:53.340]  They are the supreme leaders and they've punched out a Californian come here to rule me.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:55.340]  They're not really Californians.
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:56.340]  They're globalans.
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:00.340]  They've now brought down California to a certain extent now they're moving on to a new area to wreck it.
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:01.340]  Go ahead, Gina.
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.340]  You're on the air.
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:04.340]  Hi, Alex.
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:05.340]  First time caller.
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:24.340]  I just want to let you know when I was driving cabs here in Las Vegas, it seems that the attitude of the younger people is pretty much arrogant from California and everything that goes on in California seems to bleed right into Las Vegas.
[02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:26.340]  And it's just irritating.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:29.340]  Did you get to where you could tell if somebody was a Californian?
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:39.340]  Yes, and I could also tell who was a Texan and who was a Canadian because those two people happen to be the friendliest people you ever want to be.
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:40.340]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:47.340]  When I've been in Europe or Latin America and they hear I'm a Texan, there's like five waiters right there and just because they know we don't act like animals at least.
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:52.340]  And then I had the Californians tell me that I'm backwards empathetic.
[02:02:52.340 --> 02:03:01.340]  Oh, here's the kicker, I'm from San Francisco and I just I just can't believe the attitude, you know.
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:08.340]  By the way, 50 years ago, because I've talked to a family and also read a lot of literature, Californians were the coolest people.
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:11.340]  They were Texan beyond Texan.
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:18.340]  And then now all the yuppies and trendies and New York Manhattan folks and folks in New York are great too.
[02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:20.340]  But all the trendies move there.
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:22.340]  You see, they're not really Californians.
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:23.340]  They're trendies.
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:26.340]  And these are the grandkids of trendies.
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:28.340]  And they've all come here.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:43.340]  You know, California was made up out of gold rush people and farmers and ranchers and and woodsmen and and hunters and and researchers and trailblazers and and and and and sailors, but also entrepreneurs and brewers and everything else.
[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:50.340]  And so it became the best state in the country and now it got overrun with trendies and now it's the heart of the Hollywood culture.
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:55.340]  And it is like, I mean, these Californians, I mean, they are a piece of work and I'm talking about older people too.
[02:03:55.340 --> 02:04:00.340]  I mean, they are just the most self centered, hollow arrogance, the word.
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:03.340]  They just think they're movie stars.
[02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:11.340]  And the only thing that makes them melt is when they learn you are a quote well known person, then they get totally freaked out and hate you.
[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:13.340]  And it's like it's it's beyond bizarre.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:16.340]  Anything else you'd like to add about your experiences with Californians?
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:22.340]  Just before I left there, I was living in Marin County driving buses.
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:28.340]  And, you know, I would ask people where they were from because I could tell they weren't from the Bay Area.
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:34.340]  And yeah, so before I left, a lot of them were all transplants from different states.
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:35.340]  Let me ask you this.
[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:36.340]  Who's nicer?
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:38.340]  Texans or Canadians?
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:42.340]  Oh, you guys are both equal, both equal.
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:45.340]  Yeah, I found Canadians are super nice.
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:48.340]  Maybe we can cross breed Canadians with Texans.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:50.340]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:52.340]  It was a good, good hearing from you.
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:53.340]  God bless you.
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:54.340]  Thank you for the call, man.
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:05:19.340]  We'll see you next time with a Dock and Play Lock.
[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:26.340]  Simply add water and place outside.
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.340]  Whether you're in the aftermath of a hurricane and have lost your power,

[02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:09.340]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:30.340]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:34.340]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:37.340]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:43.340]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:48.340]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:25.340]  And I'll be honest with you, I've been in Canada, I've been in Europe, I've been in Latin America,
[02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:29.340]  I've been all over the 50 states, and people are pretty cool all over.
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:31.340]  There's different types of folks, but I love all Americans.
[02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:34.340]  And I don't want to get off into a Californian bashing fest.
[02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:43.340]  I'm talking about, because Northern Californians are like a cross between somebody from the Ozarks and somebody from Texas.
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:46.340]  Great hard-working, smart, wily people.
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.340]  You run into somebody in Southern California, a lot of nice people.
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.340]  We all know what we mean by Californians.
[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:56.340]  The trendies that if you say hi to them, they don't say anything back.
[02:08:56.340 --> 02:09:03.340]  The super arrogant people that if they hear you talking to someone, then they'll come over and tell you you're wrong.
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:12.340]  And I've just learned now, because Austin has more Californians than any other city in Texas, that they're here to run the show.
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:19.340]  And these are the people that really have hurt California, and now they've damaged that state and they've left.
[02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:25.340]  The reason I raise that, there's an NBC article about the massive exodus from California that's taking place.
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:27.340]  I'm going to go back to your calls and do a bunch of news.
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:29.340]  Dr. Blalock's never done this.
[02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:32.340]  I'm sure it's a time zone issue or some problem.
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:37.340]  He's MIA, but we'll, if it didn't pop in later, we'll get him on later in the week.
[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:39.340]  We've got a lot of news I want to cover on that front.
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:43.340]  But speaking of California, let me just show you this article right here.
[02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:44.340]  Because this is big government.
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:45.340]  This is open borders.
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:46.340]  This is carbon taxes.
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:47.340]  This is socialism.
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:50.340]  This is restricting guns.
[02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:55.340]  This is arresting surfers for no reason if they get too close to a whale.
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:59.340]  This is the letter we got sent, registered mail to us today.
[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:07.340]  And it says, City of Los Angeles, signs on public property illegally, victory.
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:08.340]  You are not alone.
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:10.340]  United, we stand.
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:17.340]  Well, we don't put out a bumper sticker or anything that says victory, you are not alone.
[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:19.340]  United, we stand.
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:26.340]  Obviously, we have operations where we say hang flyers in legal and lawful areas like
[02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:31.340]  a public commons or your YMCA or your work or hand these out to people.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:32.340]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:38.340]  If someone sticks a Barack Obama sticker up on a light pole in California, do you think
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:42.340]  they get a City of Los Angeles, California?
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:47.340]  Antonio R. Villargoza, Mayor December 6, 2012.
[02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:48.340]  It just came today.
[02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:50.340]  Do you think you get this?
[02:10:50.340 --> 02:10:51.340]  And by the way, there's no judge.
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:53.340]  There's no jury.
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:59.340]  There's no zoning and code enforcement says that I'll basically have a warrant put out
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:04.340]  for me if I don't pay them all this money.
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:10.340]  And they are demanding here in their letter.
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:14.340]  Let's show folks the invoice here if they're watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:25.340]  $300.45 or they can come after me for even more and then we'll say the fine is owed.
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:26.340]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:28.340]  Go ahead and put the warrant out for my arrest.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:30.340]  I'm not going to pay you jack squat.
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:34.340]  You new world order crime syndicate run city.
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:35.340]  Okay.
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:36.340]  How's that sound?
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:41.340]  I once got a letter from a city in New Zealand because somebody climbed up on a derelict
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:43.340]  factory building that was later got demolished.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:47.340]  We learned that's why they did it and sprayed info wars.com on it.
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.340]  They wanted me to pay thousands.
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:51.340]  They actually said, we know you climbed up and did this.
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:53.340]  Let me explain something to you.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:55.340]  And of course, they know this at the City of Los Angeles.
[02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:57.340]  There isn't due process here.
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:02.340]  You just can't send me your letter saying pay us money or you're going to go to jail.
[02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:05.340]  There has to be something called due process jack squat.
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:10.340]  You have to have a police officer or witness to say that they saw it.
[02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:15.340]  I have to be written the citation and then I have to appear in court with evidence.
[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:16.340]  Okay.
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:21.340]  We have always told people put signs in legal and lawful areas like a barn you've got on
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:22.340]  the side of the highway.
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:28.340]  This is clearly what they described here is clearly something that was homemade and they
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:31.340]  don't even say where it was posted.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:35.340]  They just say, we're God, pay us the money or you're going to go to jail.
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:40.340]  So I thought I said, should you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter?
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:48.340]  Please contact the investigation enforcement division 213-847-6088 between the hours of
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:54.340]  7 a.m. and 3.30, but hurry before the socialists collapse California maybe any day Monday through
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:55.340]  Friday.
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:13:00.340]  So there's globalist hour 7 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:08.340]  And as you may visit our office at 1149 South Broadway Suite 350 Los Angeles 90015, either
[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:12.340]  make a payment or to schedule a hearing date to speak with an investigator regarding the
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:13.340]  case.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:17.340]  Please be advised that investigators are not available for unscheduled personal conferences
[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:19.340]  regarding regular business hours.
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:20.340]  You know what they do?
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:22.340]  They drive down the road when they see graffiti or whatever.
[02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:23.340]  They jump out.
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:24.340]  They scrape it off.
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:27.340]  And if it's got a name, well, what a way to frame somebody.
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:31.340]  We've actually had this happen before where people will fake an email with our address
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:32.340]  to try to cause problems.
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:35.340]  So they'll, or they'll, they should send the Austin Police Department.
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.340]  We never found out who.
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:42.340]  A fax machine with our office fax saying, we're going to kill you or we're going to blow
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:43.340]  you up.
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:44.340]  And the cops weren't stupid.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:45.340]  They'd call it and go.
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:47.340]  This isn't really you.
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:48.340]  Is it Alex?
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:51.340]  I'd say, no, you've called five times last year.
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:56.340]  I wish you'd find, you know, find out that spoofing my fax machine, but a lot of places
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:58.340]  you get a SWAT team right over that.
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:03.340]  So this is the type of stuff that's going on.
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:14.340]  And again, we don't want bumper stickers posted in areas that are not your property.
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:18.260]  If there's an area that's a known commons in the bar scene where there's signs and hand
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:22.840]  bills put up for 20 years and it's kind of the art in the area and, and, and, and, well,
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:24.580]  well then it's, it's common law.
[02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:25.580]  That's an area for posting.
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:29.380]  So you got to play it by ear yourself, but we're going to launch something as soon as
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:30.860]  they come in the next few weeks.
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:36.740]  I've bought 160,000 info wars.com bumper stickers.
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:43.180]  And we are going to give them to, I was to come out to about 1600 or so people are going
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:46.460]  to give 100 with shipping included.
[02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:49.460]  This isn't the gimmick where it's like calling, get the vitamin only pay for the shipping
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:51.100]  and the shipping is 20 bucks.
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:52.860]  This is free shipping.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:53.860]  Don't call yet folks.
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:54.860]  They haven't come in.
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:55.860]  I got to put it up.
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:15:00.820]  We can't even charge a penny in the shopping cart because you know, you have to charge
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:03.500]  something in the shopping cart or to be able to register.
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:05.060]  I guess it's kind of a bug in it.
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:10.660]  So we'll have an email we put out and then you'll send us an email pledging that you
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:16.340]  will put up 100 of the stickers in legal, lawful areas, whether it's on your business,
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:23.100]  your car, the side of your barn or give them out to people that say that and we'll have
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:26.900]  the pledge that, you know, when you get this hundred stickers will be a letter that you
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:27.900]  pledge this.
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:30.260]  So it's all on record because we're selectively enforced.
[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:33.620]  People said, why'd you cut out on YouTube Joe Rogan cussing because they've shut our
[02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:34.900]  channels down for cussing.
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:38.940]  Oh, you can kill people and cuss whoever you want on, you know, big national channels.
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:40.100]  You don't get shut down.
[02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:42.780]  They won't even give us a partner channel on YouTube folks.
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:45.260]  We have to fight and I had to send them lawsuit.
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:50.460]  Well, I actually had to begin the filing process on YouTube once so I can even be on there.
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:56.900]  We have to scratch and battle and fight for every millimeter of space we've got.
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:59.300]  We are fought at the national level.
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:02.660]  We have had other people try to blackball us nationally.
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:05.340]  We've had people try to blackball us and talk radio.
[02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:09.940]  We have had everything you can imagine thrown at us stuff I won't even get into because
[02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:14.060]  I just know it's part of fighting a new world order doesn't get me down.
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:20.180]  It just makes me fight that much harder because it's happening where we are hitting absolute
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:26.300]  zeitgeist level on so many fronts as everything we talked about begins to happen.
[02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:33.460]  I told you 15 years ago they had hidden microphones in in lamp post and in fake transformers.
[02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:40.820]  I don't know federal purchase orders $880,000 every year and up until last year it went
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:44.500]  to more than $10 million a year just where I live.
[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:49.100]  And by the way, it was a city power department person that called me with a tip.
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.700]  I don't even have time to look at most tips myself.
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:54.300]  I hope the crew is looking in there and he's like go check this out in the federal purchase
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:55.300]  orders.
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:17:01.020]  I am installing microphones shotgun mics that listen to people at hundreds of yards away
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:03.380]  inside lamp post and fake transformers.
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:04.380]  Here's the name of the company.
[02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:08.980]  I went and found it all reported it and a month later the statesman ran a story calling
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:10.580]  them gunshot detectors.
[02:17:10.580 --> 02:17:13.460]  Don't be afraid they're gunshot detectors never use it to take gunshots.
[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:17.500]  Okay, it's back then in 1998.
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:21.780]  You don't tell people they're putting my microphones in the street lights people are going to freak
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:28.420]  out but now oh nationwide street lights have microphones all the buses are getting them.
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:34.700]  Oh your your phone in your house is watching your computer your TV your TV your DVR your
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:35.700]  cable box.
[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:39.140]  Oh yeah, it's all true.
[02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:42.420]  See now they're going to tell you about it.
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:46.900]  See they tell you about everything they're doing decades after it's in place.
[02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:50.940]  And last hour I showed you all the news articles from years ago where we showed this it's in
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:18:00.700]  my film police state 2000 1999 with the Austin America statesman showing the microphones
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:06.620]  and it's so passive for me now I'm so conditioned I know where these are at and I just haven't
[02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:11.780]  gotten a truck yet and I've got to go get a truck and I've got it and it'll say it's
[02:18:11.780 --> 02:18:16.280]  illegal I don't care I'm doing it I got to go get a truck and find a company that will
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:20.340]  go up with a cherry picker and I got to go up there and tear open one of these things
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:25.020]  to show you and I'm going to do it that's next on the list come arrest me you bastard
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:29.300]  new world order stinking microphones everywhere of course now won't even matter because we're
[02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:37.620]  like oh yeah there's microphones I mean who's with me I mean well we got to go rent this
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:42.220]  the stinking cherry picker the point is is that this is the type of stuff we're dealing
[02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:49.180]  with in this country I got work piled up so high it's so sensational where are you out
[02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:54.900]  there tearing in to these street lamps with microphones and cameras because he soon will
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:58.260]  be like oh he tore into the security device the first person to tear into one of these
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:02.140]  and I'm not saying you should do it I'm going to go out and do it the first person to tear
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:04.900]  into one of these is going to be like Rosa Park saying I ain't sitting at the back of

[02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:18.020]  vice versa but I'm just reading about all the Hollywood people are moving to Austin
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:23.460]  I go to the grocery store every once in a while see a movie star or whatever it's just crazy
[02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:27.580]  and that's great I'm not trying to run down Californians it's not Californians California
[02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:34.140]  is totally submerged in Hollywood culture it's Hollywood that is invading my beloved
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:40.500]  state ruining it and I'm not even saying all the Hollywood people themselves are bad it's
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:46.220]  the arrogance that these yuppies wear where you say hi to them I mean I'll be out in the
[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:52.820]  middle of nowhere with my dogs and my children sometimes and you'll come to a creek and there'll
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:55.740]  be some Californians there and you'll say hey how's it going they just don't even talk
[02:24:55.740 --> 02:25:00.260]  to you and and then they'll just ignore you now you run into other Californians they're
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:05.380]  real nice because they're not Californians they're these trendy oids these California
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:14.500]  oids anyway side issue I was just talking to Weldon Henson about his run into the Californians
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:18.380]  it's just bizarre we got the phones loaded on that subject by the way it's kind of fortuitous
[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:21.300]  that Dr. Blaylock didn't make it he always shows up must have been some kind of issue
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:25.540]  or time zone snafu because I wasn't going to have time to air because it didn't get
[02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:34.020]  ready until just now the video and he was going to be on this in the third hour of my
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:39.780]  confrontation down there at the federal building and I'm not going to put all the audio out
[02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:47.020]  or video of inside just because those guys look pretty darn scared but all I did was
[02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:50.260]  well I'll tell the story when we come back from break take a few more calls let's go
[02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:56.820]  to calls right now Sam wants to talk about JFK go ahead hey how you doing Alex good
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:04.980]  buddy I gotta tell you there's two months to go to the day when I called in last and
[02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:12.340]  I had an idea just listening to you yesterday speaking to Mr. Ventura you know we should
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:20.100]  make this into a million man March on the 22nd coming up next November for the 50th
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:26.380]  anniversary I agree I mean let's let's just say 20,000 if we got 20,000 people to March
[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:30.380]  on the 50th anniversary because they've said it actually said the Dallas morning news the
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:35.660]  riffraff and the carnival atmosphere the government's going to have police fence it off and no
[02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:38.820]  one's allowed to be there when the globalists never wanted to be there they killed him they
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:43.740]  move forward we've been exposing it we've now won the fight over 90% know the truth
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:47.580]  they want to ban us yeah I'm going to be there I'm going to protest the violation of the
[02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:54.540]  first amendment and the military industrial complex murdering JFK I completely agree but
[02:26:54.540 --> 02:27:00.260]  we got to shoot for 1 million we got to overwhelm them we got it just like the symbolic you
[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:05.300]  know just like 9-11 was just because of the date you say a million and then 80,000 show
[02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:10.540]  up I mean we need to have we need to have tens of thousands of people show up and I've
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:13.940]  got a great affiliate up there in Dallas I could even do an event up there when I do
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:19.940]  that Ventura likes the idea of I can rent a hotel ballroom and have our own you know
[02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:24.180]  operation that's the type of thing though they'll try to sabotage I know how the system
[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:28.460]  works and it's not that I'm even lazy to get out in the field once I do it I turn into
[02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:33.580]  a wild man it's you are storming with Texas capital or the Bilderberg group or Bohemian
[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:39.340]  Grove it's just that it's almost like grandstanding to go out and lead a big group of people but
[02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:42.820]  it needs to be done and so yes we're going to do it sir it's on.

[02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:55.500]  I know you're gonna need to get people promoting it and focusing or no one will show up.
[02:27:55.500 --> 02:28:00.180]  I agree but you know just every day mention it once you know like this could be like a
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:03.820]  sign off thing like you do a quote maybe or something but I'm telling you people are
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:06.220]  hyped and we're we are really.

[02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:29.260]  you wanted to go shooting with some friends what happened you got grandpa's gun I guess
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:35.300]  grandpa's passed on yes sir my grandfather passed away in 911 a little southern sir okay
[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:41.660]  so so you asked grandma can I borrow the gun right I asked him to borrow the gun I went
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:48.700]  out that Saturday morning shot a couple coons shot a couple of squirrels went to a friend's
[02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:53.020]  office because he was interested in buying my gun right not buying it he was interested
[02:35:53.020 --> 02:36:01.260]  in me giving it to him okay I am now facing a charge and it's called DC now it's called
[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:07.060]  transferring it's just number one you could sell your own personal guns but they will they
[02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:11.580]  will lie and and tell you and convince you the jury so dumb they'll believe it that you
[02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:17.220]  were involved in firearms selling as a business without the federal firearms license that's
[02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:21.060]  why you go to a gun show sell your private guns all day but if you sell your private
[02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:25.780]  guns and buy more and it's obviously a business they get you it's how they got so like a still
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:29.300]  just selling off some of his guns because you needed money and and this is how they
[02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:33.980]  do it and the whole thing was probably a set up because there's major federal funding
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:38.820]  the police to do this but go ahead and tell me what happened to him it was their setup
[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:44.660]  because that night proceeded on I brought the gun over to my friend's house right yeah
[02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:50.380]  I gave it to him it is no longer in my possession okay I gave this gun to him like here you
[02:36:50.380 --> 02:36:57.340]  go sir this is my gun go ahead and have fun with it right so the night went on someone
[02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:02.980]  at the house when I hadn't had some controversy with the owner of the house he went ahead
[02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:11.540]  and took a further proceedings and taking his samurai sword to his to his neck I went
[02:37:11.540 --> 02:37:16.500]  ahead broke up that fight I grabbed the samurai sword through it out is sure sure so I understand
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:20.820]  the police came in they charge you for illegal transfer of a firearm and your lawyer won't

[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:28.900]  go look at the code don't remember the number right now you go look at the code that it
[02:37:28.900 --> 02:37:34.820]  was a gift or a loan and you have no history of selling firearms and that it was a firearm
[02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:38.740]  your grandmother gave you they were loaning to a friend which is totally legal and awful
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:42.140]  look up the code I appreciate your call okay your lawyer won't tell you they're gonna hit
[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:45.660]  you and hit you hard and suck everything out of you god that's all part of the country
[02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:50.320]  of evil country of scamming of lying of fronting everybody's looking for the quick deal the
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:55.260]  quick scam the real deal is being a good person that works hard and takes action but
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:58.620]  is also smart you're not gonna find success with television you're not gonna fight with
[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:02.300]  Hollywood you're not gonna fight with all the trendy avenues the real world is waiting
[02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:06.060]  for you though the globalists are the only ones that are there they're in the real world
[02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:12.140]  outside the machine manipulating and controlling all the levers and hoping you never figure
[02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:16.860]  out that it's a matrix that it's an artificial environment they're building that they want
[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:21.540]  to insert us into and by the way that's a new Pentagon report out in wire magazine you
[02:38:21.540 --> 02:38:25.940]  may have heard it talked about a few times by a talk show host again I know what I talk
[02:38:25.940 --> 02:38:34.540]  about is fantastical reality is fantastic and the best news I've ever gotten is that
[02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:38.740]  I can hear all the big national talk show host and others picking up my talking points
[02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:43.580]  and we're making it safe to talk about this that is our greatest power is that we are
[02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:49.820]  being ripped off for everything we cover and do which I love I love it keep it up keep
[02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:55.180]  it up that anybody out there you can take research we do points I make things I do run
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:39:00.540]  with it I know a lot of you haven't developed yet and you're jealous and envious of me
[02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:04.940]  and so you're not willing to take the info because because you know you're getting it
[02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:10.300]  from us hey they're in ego here this is about survival ladies and gentlemen this is about
[02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:17.340]  whatever works best to expose the globalists with the truth use it okay and so our time
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:22.220]  is coming your time as a patriot is coming now is the time people are ready to listen
[02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:26.060]  don't worry about brain damage zombies out there you know that serve the system and you
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:31.220]  can't get through to it and then self-satisfiedly laugh at you through arrogance because they
[02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:34.820]  believe they're part of the system that's a defense mechanism because they feel incredibly
[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:42.460]  weak okay get out there now is the time to save humanity so many people hate humanity
[02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:46.860]  because they're frustrated they feel like failures they have this instinctive race memory
[02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:50.820]  of great things their ancestors did and great things they should be doing and they don't
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:56.380]  like what the world is offering and they don't like the fakeness of it and it feels very
[02:39:56.380 --> 02:40:01.620]  nauseating and disgusting and so they start hating their fellow man and believe me it's
[02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:07.540]  easy instead of loving your fellow humans and understanding their victims of the technotronic
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:14.420]  age you don't know what that is you need to look it up presents he'll tell you now is
[02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:20.400]  the time for a revolution against dehumanization a revolution against those that would shutter
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:29.180]  our minds a revolution against dehumanization now is the time you stand at the crossroads
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:33.180]  soon the window of opportunity will close and we'll have to go through an incredible
[02:40:33.180 --> 02:40:38.940]  technotronic technocratic dark age the city states will rise the old nations will die
[02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:43.500]  the city states will combine forces into the global crime syndicate combine neo feudalism
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:53.020]  will be restored a great time of just humans being torn to pieces is going to be with us
[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:59.060]  a boot stomping on the human face forever we need to slingshot around this gravitational
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:05.020]  black hole but we're approaching the event horizon where we're going to go in through
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:12.320]  and beyond it is my wish to go around it but I am accelerating and accelerating everyone
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:18.780]  else is you know to use a quantum mechanics physics example I am accelerating the information
[02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:24.220]  and I am trying to accelerate as many people as we can to slingshot around the black hole
[02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:29.300]  and to miss it but soon we're going to know and I'll be able to tell you from my estimation
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:32.500]  doesn't mean I'm totally right whether we need to go ahead and turn towards the center
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:41.140]  and go full throttle in okay and then once that starts Katie by the door I can't believe
[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:46.620]  people say their lives are empty we are living in an absolute science fiction movie I mean
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:55.760]  we're living in the matrix this is amazing whoa a scientific takeovers taking place
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:04.180]  by mad scientist and we care what trendy sloths walking around acting effeminate when they
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:08.700]  come up and tell us we're not trendy we we cower to them we should laugh at them not
[02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:13.100]  because we want to make them feel bad that is only thing that deprograms them is to laugh
[02:42:13.100 --> 02:42:16.780]  at them and then explain them about the real world it's a it's a it's a two by four up
[02:42:16.780 --> 02:42:23.100]  against the head I call upon the human survival instinct to be activated and your subconscious
[02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:27.540]  mind knows that that is even if your conscious doesn't we are under grave attack we are under
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:32.980]  grave assault this is an emergency worldwide transmission announcement activate your survival
[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:39.580]  mechanisms now activate your survival mechanisms now go to the life boats this civilization
[02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:46.140]  is a guillotine a kill system awaken the life boat is finding your primitive power drive
[02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:53.180]  find it activate it fire it up ask your cerebral cortex to access the basic programs God gave
[02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:58.540]  you and we will beat this you've got the tools you've got to activate your resistance programming
[02:42:58.540 --> 02:43:04.340]  now activated they've turned off your survival mechanisms they've turned off your life force
[02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:11.900]  life preservation hillbilly programming reactivate now get off their GMO their fluoride nerve
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:16.540]  gas weapon systems get off as much poison grade as you can you're still going to be hit by
[02:43:16.540 --> 02:43:22.420]  a lot of it but it's turned up to a certain level where everybody doesn't drop dead immediately
[02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:26.500]  as they increase the kill level if you just cut way back on the amount of poison you're
[02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:31.780]  getting in the system it's titrated for a higher level for the general public you'll
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:35.780]  be at a much better operating system you understand that so you don't have to get rid of all
[02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:39.500]  the poison you never will try to get rid as much of it as you can as much clean water
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:44.140]  as you can get as much nutrients vitamins exercise just communing with the you know
[02:43:44.140 --> 02:43:50.340]  God the universe making that connection energizing just saying I'm weak God of the universe help

[02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:04.860]  snake the giant boa constrictor of the new old orders wrapped around me it's crushing

[02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:15.100]  strength you have to grab the snake by the neck and you've got to start squeezing it
[02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:19.420]  and decide you're going to tear its head off you understand that snake is wrapped around
[02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:27.340]  us all ladies and gentlemen right up to skip this final break get this piece man I'm gonna
[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:39.780]  start telling people what I really think you've got to ask God to free you that's why every
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:43.380]  culture when they worship and God they open their hands up ladies and gentlemen they can
[02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:49.700]  feel the energy the universe bends towards justice you've got though to say I stand with
[02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:56.180]  justice I'm weak I'm a sinner I'm bad make me strong take me over because the evil's
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:59.300]  going to take you over you're either going to turn yourself over to good freely good
[02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:05.100]  will not take you over evil will evil's battering ramming all of us get me control get me control
[02:45:05.100 --> 02:45:12.660]  get me control good won't do that you have to say help me help me I went out of this
[02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:18.060]  and that's where the commitment comes against this evil all right our own Molly Rogers great
[02:45:18.060 --> 02:45:24.140]  photographer she can even make me look half decent the photos you've been seeing out there
[02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:28.620]  she she wanted to go out and take photos downtown so we got surveillance camera photos but also
[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:33.780]  capital photos for the magazine in force magazine this is about two weeks ago now and she goes
[02:45:33.780 --> 02:45:36.860]  out she goes back and she goes you know you say we can take photos of buildings but the
[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:39.860]  feds came out and the guy had a badge and everything and said he was going to arrest
[02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:44.100]  me that I was a terrorist that I look shady and then I couldn't take photos in America
[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:48.220]  that he might arrest me and all this stuff and I had to go show her look you know the
[02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:51.700]  Supreme Court had just ruled the day before that you can take government buildings and
[02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:55.660]  police in public and I had to show her that and I said we'll go down there so about a
[02:45:55.660 --> 02:46:00.220]  week later week and a half later we went down there and they were out there in 30 seconds
[02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:03.420]  on her and they do it to other Austinites and we shouldn't even know it was a federal
[02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:07.780]  boat and they got like five of them downtown it's unmarked and finally a security guard
[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:12.700]  comes out we're leaving goes oh I'm a listener no no they didn't call me I was just doing
[02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:16.940]  my rounds it's a big building and then I said well where are they well the federal police
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:20.180]  were inside he goes we'll go make a complaint so I went and opened the gate went in and
[02:46:20.180 --> 02:46:25.140]  talked to him and so we'll go ahead and play this report here but here's the deal if they
[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:31.140]  can tell you a woman clean cut out on the side of the street taking photos of a bunch
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:35.500]  of surveillance cameras obviously a terrorist could get Google Earth obviously a terrorist
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:40.380]  could drive by it's about making you feel like you're a suspect it's this role reversal
[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:45.620]  where government is our master we're the servant and we're dirty bad you know terrorists
[02:46:45.620 --> 02:46:50.620]  when the government runs the terrorist on record so here's the video here's the audio
[02:46:50.620 --> 02:46:53.860]  and it'll be up on info wars dot com the next 30 minutes I don't know we're gonna name it
[02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:58.980]  yet probably something like Alex Jones confronts the feds on their turf and they wouldn't come
[02:46:58.980 --> 02:47:03.220]  out for me the federal police stayed inside it was later security guards on their rounds
[02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:06.900]  that came up and that at least the first one was a listener and so we're all in the gate
[02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:12.780]  for you go talk to him so here is that video and audio why don't you decide to join the
[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:18.100]  republic why don't you decide to join the first amendment and stand with George Washington
[02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:26.980]  and Thomas Jefferson and this is boy warning American that we don't have the right to come
[02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:30.380]  yeah and I forgot my bullhorn so I was using my own voice this is right up against the
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:36.220]  federal building with him looking at me out the windows here it is Alex Jones versus a
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:43.460]  federal tyranny command post that's the name Rob gave it and shows Molly's photos very
[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:49.100]  well produced police arrest folks all over the country for filming them in public no
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:54.180]  matter how many times state and federal courts say it's constitutional and federal buildings
[02:47:54.180 --> 02:47:59.420]  they'll say don't video take even if it's the middle of downtown Austin like we're terrorist
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:04.540]  it's ridiculous you can go to Google Earth or Google Street view and see all of this
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:08.580]  it's all about teaching you that you're bad and that you're a suspect and that you've
[02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:12.980]  done something wrong it's all an act of domination by now to control government it's like telling
[02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:16.380]  black folks sit at the back of the bus or the TSA sticking their hands down your pants
[02:48:16.380 --> 02:48:21.340]  so we've sent reporters down to the NSA they take other reporters footage they didn't take
[02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:24.300]  ours as we told them about lawsuits and they knew about them you know they knew they'd
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:30.620]  been losing lawsuits and it's the same thing with these guys we have to exercise our rights
[02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:36.540]  and make a long story short Molly was out getting photos last week for info wars magazine
[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:40.420]  of just different government buildings and satellite equipment and cameras and things
[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:44.740]  for the big brother edition we've got coming out in a few months and they came over and
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:47.420]  said you look shady get out of here she said but it's America and they said we don't care
[02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:50.860]  get out of here we're gonna you know basically grab you so we're going over there now because
[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:56.940]  we all like bullies who think this is a North Korea here we go hey where is it so I was
[02:48:56.940 --> 02:49:01.940]  right at the corner you see all the surveillance cameras the corner of the building right here
[02:49:01.940 --> 02:49:08.740]  yeah and they came over and said you look shady yes they said it's illegal to take pictures
[02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:16.260]  of any fed building especially if you're taking pictures of security and that is total absolute
[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:20.540]  force and and and again this is the federal government that's on record shipping the narcotics
[02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:25.340]  into this country for the last 50 years this is the federal government that's using al-qaeda
[02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:31.180]  even the clatchy newspaper and la times now report against Libya and Syria and giving
[02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:36.180]  a missiles but we can't film them because we might be terrorists no you work for the
[02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:41.220]  foreign banks that are the terrorist so here we are here we are I mean we're not a little
[02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:47.980]  lady out here of course they monitor us as well they know I've said I'm coming down here
[02:49:47.980 --> 02:49:54.060]  we are in America no no they rather corner American citizens and turn this slowly into
[02:49:54.060 --> 02:49:59.260]  North Korea intimidating each person having a chewing effect on people by the way you
[02:49:59.260 --> 02:50:03.260]  really believe all this terrorism crud you could drive by here all day and videotape
[02:50:03.260 --> 02:50:08.040]  you could go to Google Earth and look down into their back courtyard you could go to
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:12.700]  street view and other services and see everything right here no no it's about coming out to
[02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:18.060]  her and saying hey you're not in America anymore you don't come here and you don't
[02:50:18.060 --> 02:50:24.060]  videotape your god your king you're supposed to kneel down and beg the federal government
[02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:28.980]  to take all of your liberties that's what you're supposed to do it's unbelievable that this
[02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:33.300]  country's turned into and how the federal government run by foreign banks thinks it
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:40.300]  can intimidate the press in this country well that's over because the spirit of 1776 is
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:49.300]  rising worldwide now your security crew came out here and told my reporter and my photographer
[02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:55.460]  that she wasn't in America anymore that she was in North Korea and that she could be disappeared
[02:50:55.460 --> 02:51:02.380]  if she dare come here and show this facility how dare you tell people it's illegal to film
[02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:10.580]  your cancer centers to film your fund banker occupation command centers and I for one am
[02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:18.260]  not going to stand here idle while you tell us that we don't have a forced amendment and
[02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:28.420]  while you lie while you lie the federal government is run by foreign banks the federal government
[02:51:28.420 --> 02:51:34.300]  ships in the narcotics the federal government runs the white slavery and child kidnapping
[02:51:34.300 --> 02:51:42.420]  rings all you are is a collection agency for private banks Goldman Sachs Bank of America
[02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:52.780]  Wells Fargo JP Morgan Chase crime syndicate the so-called president ship guns into Mexico
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:52:01.460]  to blame the second amendment we are sick of it we know the truth and we know your spine
[02:52:01.460 --> 02:52:09.460]  on it a leg away and because you know your committee crimes the wicked flea would not
[02:52:09.460 --> 02:52:19.100]  are food and so we are here telling you now don't you ever try to intimidate women and
[02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:30.380]  children and tell them that they don't have a first amendment you are attempting to convert
[02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:41.940]  our country into a open charity and on behalf of the Declaration of Independence the Constitution
[02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:47.900]  the Bill of Rights and all of our veterans that fought and died for supposed freedom
[02:52:47.900 --> 02:52:59.940]  I issue you now on video a cease and desist we know your controller stage 9 11 we know
[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:10.380]  you work for narcotics traffickers and money launderers do not be on the roadside of history
[02:53:10.380 --> 02:53:24.580]  the answer to your 1984 tyranny is 177 asserts you are al-qaeda this building is al-qaeda
[02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:29.740]  on record and there are the federal marshals and FBI and they're peering down on us it
[02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:35.460]  was a federal marshal sent me the homeland security report where you say returning veterans
[02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:41.140]  are the number one terrorist along with gun owners so I know you're not all bad but to
[02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:48.380]  your controllers they are bad and we're calling them out I wanted you to come out here today
[02:53:48.380 --> 02:53:54.300]  in your drama queen garbage and act all put out and act like we're criminals and act like
[02:53:54.300 --> 02:54:00.100]  we're bad and act like we're dirty so that I could show people how ridiculous it is
[02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:06.140]  and show them news articles admitting you run al-qaeda you ran him in 1980 you ran him
[02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:14.980]  in 2001 and you run him right now and your own FBI deputy director O'Neill said that
[02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:22.940]  before he was killed so you're not all bad but we need to see more of you speak out
[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:30.500]  hey how's it going how you doing I'm Alex Jones hey she was here last week just getting
[02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:34.260]  shots around the city from my magazine one of my reporters and you guys told her it's
[02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:39.420]  illegal to film your federal building yeah was it come on over here Molly was it one
[02:54:39.420 --> 02:54:49.260]  of these guys but it came out of that door that one of the federal marshals are one
[02:54:49.260 --> 02:54:53.780]  of the FBI guys um if they're in a suit I mean it could have been one of the marshals
[02:54:53.780 --> 02:54:58.340]  that it could have been yeah well we just wanted to tell you and we could pull email
[02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:04.220]  it to you like the Supreme Court's ruled there's been hundreds of state rulings you can film
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:10.020]  federal buildings NSA buildings TSA as long as you don't interfere with the internal operations
[02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:14.020]  of it and it's called the first amendment like in North Korea they come and arrest you
[02:55:14.020 --> 02:55:17.500]  if you film a building and I last time I heard I'm not in North Korea right right well I'm
[02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:23.740]  actually by the way oh really yeah am I getting trouble saying that buddy well listen I know
[02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:27.220]  there's a lot of good people because I've had federal marshals give us you know great
[02:55:27.220 --> 02:55:31.820]  tips on things yeah my issue is a guy came out the suit and she didn't know it's a federal
[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:36.100]  building we said go get some shots to the Capitol get some shots of you know cameras
[02:55:36.100 --> 02:55:39.940]  and stuff and she's over here well who finally have to go a shot for a big brother issue
[02:55:39.940 --> 02:55:43.860]  and they come out and say hey you look shady we can arrest you and so I said you know what
[02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:47.660]  we're gonna come here because if we don't defend the first amendment we're gonna lose
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:53.220]  well you have every right to do so I mean if if you guys want to speak to one of the
[02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:57.820]  employees one of the marshals then you know you can go there and talk to them sure Molly
[02:55:57.820 --> 02:56:01.380]  you want to go tell them what happened to you what do you look like here come give us
[02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:07.860]  a description Molly I'd say in his mid sixties and he was wearing a business suit with a
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:18.340]  tag oh there should be a representative okay so that's court security sixty years old tags
[02:56:18.340 --> 02:56:25.860]  suit what color was his hair it was like pepper and then and then what was he what description
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:32.780]  was he black white he was white he was white and he was about what color eyes I don't remember
[02:56:32.780 --> 02:56:38.900]  he had glasses on actually think about it well because of the fact that I'm not a federal
[02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:43.060]  police officer and I'm a security officer I can't take your complaint and send it through
[02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:48.020]  you guys no I know but he came out and told her it was illegal okay well correct well
[02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:51.660]  if you would like I mean feel free to go in there and talk to him you got about 30 minutes
[02:56:51.660 --> 02:57:00.660]  before they close okay folks that's it the exciting conclusion when we get it up on info
[02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:05.780]  wars.com and prisonbunna.com the next 30 minutes radio listeners and go see when we go in and
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:10.060]  at first they all get in our face and then I point out you know that there's a civil
[02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:13.500]  rights violation and they admit it they go no you're allowed to fail to have the building
[02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:20.900]  obviously and that's all on tape but the point is is that it's not fun to go down and confront
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:23.860]  the federal government because those people that worked there I don't think are probably
[02:57:23.860 --> 02:57:29.140]  criminals but up top they are criminals narcotics traffickers child kidnapping runners al-qaeda
[02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:33.660]  runners I mean by the way if you're a radio listener on the video we show news articles
[02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:39.020]  mainstream for everything I'm claiming and so the federal government is foreign bank
[02:57:39.020 --> 02:57:44.340]  run the foreign banks run al-qaeda our government is al-qaeda run our government is al-qaeda
[02:57:44.340 --> 02:57:49.900]  okay all day they tell us we're al-qaeda we could be al-qaeda we're guilty until briven
[02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:54.860]  innocent because we could be al-qaeda they're al-qaeda you're al-qaeda you're guilty I don't
[02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:59.100]  trust you I'm watching you that's the American way don't trust government keep it small
[02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:06.460]  see I'm with George Washington I'm not with Janet Napolitano one last point folks Christmas

[03:00:11.380 --> 03:00:18.100]  Yep it's another hour ladies and gentlemen of real talk radio real issues that we cover
[03:00:18.100 --> 03:00:22.160]  here Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central I wanted to jam in a few more calls
[03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:30.100]  of people that are holding here on the transmission let's talk to Josh in Indiana let's talk
[03:00:30.100 --> 03:00:33.740]  about 2012 and I'll get more into that in a special report I'm doing tonight I'll go
[03:00:33.740 --> 03:00:40.340]  ahead Josh hey how we doing brother good man thanks for holding hey no problem first off
[03:00:40.340 --> 03:00:45.100]  I'll tell you that I really love you and appreciate you and what you're doing and I consider
[03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:52.220]  you a strong brother in Christ well thank you sir I tried and you're doing a fine job
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:59.180]  and I'd like to hear you rebuke or comment on the zeitgeist films and how they're kind
[03:00:59.180 --> 03:01:06.220]  of twisting the spiritual aspect what they say in the first zeitgeist on religion is
[03:01:06.220 --> 03:01:12.620]  a distortion and and I was used without permission in that first one and so I got so many Christian
[03:01:12.620 --> 03:01:19.420]  groups who are like a bunch of Pharisees coming after me before even being in that and then
[03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:24.020]  I had Peter Joseph on and he said I need to be sent to a reeducation camp and then he
[03:01:24.020 --> 03:01:29.660]  told me he never said that even though there's video of it or you know him on the show so
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:33.340]  but a lot of people are simple minded they watch that they believe living in a giant
[03:01:33.340 --> 03:01:37.980]  plastic city run by a computer is great well that's just eugenics to the globalist called
[03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:45.220]  for h.g. Wells called for in his seminal book I forget the name of it I've read it we cover
[03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:49.820]  it in game because he made a film by a similar name ask Aaron the name of the things to come
[03:01:49.820 --> 03:01:55.500]  things to come and so I mean I know it when I see it it's just that people who aren't
[03:01:55.500 --> 03:02:01.860]  well researched I mean I don't think Peter Joseph is a bad guy sure takes himself serious
[03:02:01.860 --> 03:02:08.540]  though let me tell you but anything else well I just kind of feel like you know anybody
[03:02:08.540 --> 03:02:13.460]  who's saying you know 2012 is going to bring about this spiritual awakening and there's
[03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:18.140]  we're all can be a God I mean that's just rubbish that's just new old order globalist
[03:02:18.140 --> 03:02:22.620]  propaganda well saying you can be a God is but there's always a counterfeit of that but
[03:02:22.620 --> 03:02:27.020]  you can become empowered by awakening more God bless you I appreciate your call that
[03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:31.180]  there's counterfeits of everything I mean look my whole deal is whether you're are you
[03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:36.380]  for good or you for evil you know I mean the system tries to make it super complex let's
[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:45.380]  talk to Jerry in New York go ahead hey Alex I have an idea why don't we do a TSA type
[03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:53.220]  of deal with cash I heard that guy from my name may bring say here Connecticut do a 50s
[03:02:53.220 --> 03:02:58.500]  100s whatever every once a month everybody withdraw as much money as they can and use
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:04.140]  as much cash but these people with this drive you say hey look it says it's it's legal tender
[03:03:04.140 --> 03:03:09.380]  you have to take it but it drives the banks crazy no no I agree listen I've tried to get
[03:03:09.380 --> 03:03:13.540]  a thousand dollars out and had them act like I'm a criminal at the bank Gerald Salenta
[03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:17.420]  tried to get a few thousand out they did it I mean it's crazy how they're training us
[03:03:17.420 --> 03:03:23.020]  that breathing is illegal but the government gang raping us is loving federal courts are
[03:03:23.020 --> 03:03:27.140]  ruling they can taser you to make you answer questions it's torture I mean next they'll
[03:03:27.140 --> 03:03:33.820]  say they can barbecue your child I mean it's the government is cancer it's out of control
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:39.460]  no but we can use their own weapons against them what what I'm getting at is because every
[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:45.620]  physical dollar taken out if you took out a CD or whatever or your cash is a dollar
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:49.820]  they can't multiply no I agree we need to cash cash cash so they can't do fractional
[03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:54.260]  reserve banking God bless you great points Diana Louisiana wants to talk about Ben Swan
[03:03:54.260 --> 03:04:00.100]  the reporter go ahead quickly hey handsome look I just came up with an idea and I know
[03:04:00.100 --> 03:04:05.420]  that Ben is not associated with the Fox network and I'm thinking maybe your management team
[03:04:05.420 --> 03:04:10.940]  can get in touch with he is so you can get some live air time to help wake up the masses
