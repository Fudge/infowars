[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Even Dr. King's assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd's death did.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  Where are we now as we reflect on this day?
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.000]  Well, I think that we are where we must renew the battle and the fight
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  to preserve what Dr. King and his generation gave us, and that was voting rights.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  State legislatures all around the country that are controlled by Republicans
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  are doing everything they can to keep people from voting.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Who are they trying to keep from voting?
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  Black people, brown people, college students, people who live on tribal reservations,
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  trying to keep those folks from voting because they might vote Democratic.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  As expected, the self-righteous left has desecrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  using the remembrance of a man to brainwash the gullible masses into voting
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  for the depraved Democrats' federalization of elections,
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  which would eliminate voter ID and use taxpayer dollars to fund their campaign commercials.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  Nothing less is at stake than our democracy.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  This is about suppressing the vote.
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  It's about nullifying the elections, which Dr. King talked about that day.
[01:12.000 --> 01:19.000]  If you really, truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[01:25.000 --> 01:33.000]  He has a monument on the Mall along with Abraham Lincoln, George Washington,
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  Thomas Jefferson, all of them with tears in their eyes
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  for the departure from our democracy that is happening right now.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  This is part of the big plan to control what happens in America.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  I believe what happens in America.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  If you take those voting rights away, people are going to be so angry,
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  but there'll be nothing they can do about it because we're in charge.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  Next thing comes the women. We're going to take your rights away.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  It's like we're taking X, Y, and Z because there'll be nothing you can do.
[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  This country, seemingly, or many people in it, seemingly want to be manipulated.
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  I was going to say to destroy it. They are censoring journalists.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  That will happen here. That will happen here.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  I think if the Republicans are back in power, you can see that they're intractable right now.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  You cannot reason with these people. They are shameless.
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.000]  Meanwhile, newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Eric Adams declined to use his veto power
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  on a bill that would allow 800,000 non-citizens to vote in New York City,
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  tossing the Constitution that MLK honored into the dustbin of history.
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.000]  I think it's imperative that people who are in a local municipality have the right to decide who's going to govern them.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  And what do you say to all the people who went through the process,
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  the difficult process of becoming an American citizen?
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  I say to them, keep doing it. You know, membership has its privileges.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  While the FBI treated Martin Luther King as a terrorist,
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  yet getting brutally ratioed for tweeting out support for MLK,
[03:10.000 --> 03:18.000]  while simultaneously focusing solely on white supremacy as the only terror threat in the United States.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  And it was not specifically related to the Jewish community,
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  but we're continuing to work to find motive, and we will continue on that path.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  And as mainstream media hemorrhages viewership for ignoring truths like these,
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  the double standards have become so repugnant that a recent Gallup poll revealed
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  that Americans of every political affiliation are abandoning the sociopaths
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  of the self-serving totalitarian Democratic Party in droves.
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  I feel that we are in the midst of the most critical period in our nation,
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  and the economic problem is probably the most serious problem
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  confronting the Negro community.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  And I might say the most serious problem confronting poor people generally,
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  and I don't want to be narrow about this, talking only about the black poor in our country,
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  because I must be concerned about Puerto Ricans who are poor,
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  Mexican Americans, American Indians, and Appalachian whites.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  And we are confronting a major depression in the poor community.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  MLK was a Boston personalist.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  He would have wanted us all to realize that we are not insignificant
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  specks of dust in the vast universe,
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  because it is impossible for the entire universe to exist without a person experiencing it.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  Furthermore, the Democratic Party, the World Economic Forum, Davos Bilderberg
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  and the bloodlines of the Illuminati are not the masters of that universe.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  for what the globalists are doing right now.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest,
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  because now they've revealed themselves.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  But they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  and shut down people telling the truth.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast,
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  Plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  and the things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[05:56.000 --> 06:20.000]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[06:20.000 --> 06:27.000]  At this pivotal moment, I see several priorities for the global agenda.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  We must continue to fight against the global pandemic.
[06:32.000 --> 06:41.000]  We must revitalize the global economy and accelerate its transition to net zero.
[06:41.000 --> 06:50.000]  We must preserve biodiversity by deploying nature-based solutions, and we must narrow
[06:50.000 --> 06:59.000]  the gap between the rich and the poor to achieve more sustainable global development.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  With these goals in mind, it is my distinct honor and great privilege
[07:04.000 --> 07:12.000]  to introduce His Excellency Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China,
[07:12.000 --> 07:28.000]  to open the Davos to China.
[07:28.000 --> 07:37.000]  It's Wednesday, January 19th, 2022, and it's another edition of In Full Wars.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  Well, we passed the Rubicon a long time ago of the globalists
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  cutting the bottom out of civilization and the collapse is now moving faster and faster by the day.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  Interstate travel is going to be cut off if you don't have your vaccine passport.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  This is what you're now seeing happen in Europe and Australia.
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  Canada is now beginning to move to establish a dictatorship, as Trudeau said he would do several years ago,
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.000]  announcing that no one can buy or sell without the injections and the tracker systems in the phones,
[08:14.000 --> 08:21.000]  and that no U.S. trucks can come into Canada unless you take at least four shots a year.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  Four shots that erase your immune system and turn you into a factory producing spike protein
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  that can then infect others with nanotech.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  That's why there's so much illness.
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.000]  Now, we have incredible numbers out of the National Television Bureau of Australia.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  They're the biggest channel.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  And I've got a bunch of other articles where with a straight face,
[08:46.000 --> 08:56.000]  they say half of the hospitalizations, more than half of the hospitalizations in ICU are the vaccinated.
[08:56.000 --> 09:03.000]  Now, I want to be clear, that's not half of the people that have COVID that are hospitalized have been vaccinated.
[09:03.000 --> 09:11.000]  Half of the total patients have been vaccinated,
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  which is what all the numbers show out of Canada, the U.S. and Europe, it is the injected that gets sick.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  Almost everybody I know that's gotten deathly ill took the damn vaccine.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  And then when they take it, it sheds, which Pfizer admits, and gets you sick.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  People around you.
[09:30.000 --> 09:38.000]  They turn our own bodies into viral, synthetic viral suicide bombs.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  This is so incredible. That is just one of the articles, ladies and gentlemen, that I have today.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  One of them. It gets even more powerful.
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  Let's put the live show headline up if we can for viewers.
[09:53.000 --> 10:02.000]  The head of the U.N. vaccine program has come out and said,
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  do not give these children the COVID shots.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  There's no evidence it helps them and mounting evidence it hurts them.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  Now, is she covering her ass because she knows what's coming down?
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  Adam Salazar wrote a big article yesterday that went viral on Infowars.com after the show ended
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  that we're going to play coming up next segment where a doctor tells the patient,
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  don't give this shot to your children. It's going to be pulled soon.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  I'm going to say that again.
[10:39.000 --> 10:48.000]  We have the head of the United Nations WHO worldwide vaccine program saying,
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  do not give any more COVID shots to children.
[10:51.000 --> 10:59.000]  We have the European Union Medical Commission saying, do not give any more COVID shots to children and stop it.
[10:59.000 --> 11:15.000]  We have the FDA scientist and we have the CDC scientist in the middle of last year being forced to resign
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  because they couldn't get them to pass giving 12 in-ups teenagers the shots.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  Now it's five in-ups and they have the new board members on TV saying,
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  well, we don't know what this is going to do.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  We just got to give it to the kids and he starts laughing.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  But they do know what it would do.
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  The CDC doctors from October of 2020, now 14, 15 months ago, they say all the things that were going to happen.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  Microcarditis, heart attacks, blood clots, strokes. This is a planned operation.
[11:46.000 --> 11:58.000]  Let that sink in that the ruling globalist controllers knowingly did all of this and knew it would happen and have now done it.
[11:58.000 --> 12:12.000]  And the majority of people in Israel and the majority of people in the UK and the majority of people in Spain in the hospitals who are sick and dying of COVID
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  have been quote, double or triple jab, but it gets worse.
[12:16.000 --> 12:25.000]  In Australia, more than half the total ICU patients counting other people there with heart attack strokes and everything else,
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  half of them have been vaxed.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  I mean, you think about those numbers.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  That means it's massively boosted the number of people that are getting ill.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  And we have insurance company actuaries.
[12:43.000 --> 12:53.000]  We have that big global study done by the big university up in Canada last week in 144 countries.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And what does it say?
[12:57.000 --> 13:08.000]  That there is a doubling worldwide on average in the number of people dying and it's all correlated back to the injections.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  The John Hopkins number show the same thing.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  Take the shot, get sick and die.
[13:15.000 --> 13:23.000]  And I know people personally that have taken it in my family to rebel and good friends of mine that just didn't believe me.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  And they are not the same people.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  They are not as smart as they were.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  They look unhealthy.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  They've lost a lot of weight.
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  And it makes me cry to even look at them.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  This is it.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  I mean, we're living in a world where we're just being murdered.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  And then those that haven't taken the shots, they get super sick as well.
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  I know so many people that have almost died or died from this garbage.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  And I remember telling Dr. Peter McCullough who's very smart.
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  He's like, oh, if you've got immunity to COVID, you'll be able to not get any other variants.
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  And I said to him months ago, I said, Doc, that's not true from all my research.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  It's a synthetic bio weapon that's been released.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  And you know, behind the scenes, he obviously knows that.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  And watch, there'll be new variants that get people sick as well because they're not variants.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  They're new viruses.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  They already have on the shelf.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  And now you see that.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  This is a biological weapon attack.
[14:22.000 --> 14:36.000]  Now, we have the head of the UN vaccine program who in December of 2020 did a two day conference in Switzerland at the WHO headquarters.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  And we went through the two days of video, 16 hours of the conferences.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  And she said, vaccines don't work.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  We don't test them.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  We're just told by a big pharma that sponsors us to do it.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  And our front lines gotten wobbly.
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  And our doctors know these shots are killing people around the world.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  And then they had all these other scientists up there agreeing.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Why were they covering their ass then?
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  Because they knew what was about to come.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  And they wanted it on record that they had warned people.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  How do you think Wolfgang Wudar, head advisor to the EU in public?
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  And I'm not saying he was involved, but he was warning people.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  He wasn't like running like the UN.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  He was opposing.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  And how do you think Michael Yidon, former head of Pfizer science division, went public, a virologist?
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  Why do you think Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA went public?
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  They know what this is.
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  They know.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  And they knew.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  And what they said would happen happened.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  They've been heroes.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, now the head of the UN program came out and she said,
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  don't give children shots anymore.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  Because they finally, it's so evil.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  They know it's a depopulation weapon.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  They're like, God, I'm going to kill kids.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  That's a little too far for her and for Tony Montana and even for most people in the mafia.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  But all the rest of you going along with this, you are now the murderers of children.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  You're aiding and abetting the killing of them.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  And you will be held accountable.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  It's in the rearview mirror.
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  But you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to the new year at infowarstore.com.

[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.

[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  Is it time to just move out to the woods? Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  Just get off grid? Just get the emergency food supplies? Just live off the land?
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  That's the survival instinct. But see the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me,
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  says no, no, no, no, no. Stay in the city.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere there ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[19:54.000 --> 20:14.000]  And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[20:24.000 --> 20:42.000]  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.
[20:42.000 --> 20:53.000]  I see a line of cars and they are painted black. With flowers and my love won't never to come back.
[20:53.000 --> 21:00.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, here we are broadcasting worldwide in what could be the final days of our republic
[21:00.000 --> 21:10.000]  and the ushering in of a long worldwide scientific biomedical tyranny run by the most vicious behavioral psychologist the world has ever seen.
[21:10.000 --> 21:28.000]  What we are witnessing is going to make the Soviet and Nazi and communist Chinese excesses look like a cakewalk.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  Please, if you can, put up the live show feed headline for today.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  I want people to read that headline again and let that sink in.
[21:36.000 --> 21:52.000]  Wednesday Live, head of UNVAC's program warns against injecting children as GOP lawmakers demand answers to FBI's, excuse me, to FDA's troubling attack on kids.
[21:52.000 --> 22:04.000]  Read that again. Wednesday Live, head of UNVAC's program warns against injecting children as GOP lawmakers demand answers to FDA's troubling attack on kids.
[22:04.000 --> 22:16.000]  Then we go on. Meanwhile in Australia, over half the people in hospital ICUs have been vaccinated against, have been faxed with Merck's COVID-19 bio weapon.
[22:16.000 --> 22:27.000]  Now read that again. Meanwhile in Australia, over half the people in hospital ICUs have been faxed with Merck's COVID-19 bio weapon.
[22:27.000 --> 22:42.000]  Also, Dr. Darren Beatty of Revolver News will break new January 6 false flag information and discuss the Democratic Party's announcement that they will be seeking the indictment of Trump to stop him from running for office in 2024.
[22:42.000 --> 22:48.000]  Boy, doesn't that just say a lot there.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  And Saki came out at a press conference. We'll play that coming up the last segment of this hour.
[22:53.000 --> 23:00.000]  And she defended Biden saying that the American people are terrorist enemies.
[23:00.000 --> 23:10.000]  Just a couple days before she and Paul Begala said, it's not the fault of the Democrats. It's the Democratic constituents are bad, not the leaders.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  So Democrat constituents, they're just bad people, but the Republicans are terrorists.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  Well, they're really letting you know what they think about you. What a nice group of people.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  Dems plot to prosecute Trump over January 6 to prevent him from running in 2024.
[23:30.000 --> 23:38.000]  And guys, this article printed, but just get me a printer friendly because it cut off a bunch of quotes. Thanks. I want to read them on air. Thank you.
[23:38.000 --> 23:49.000]  I'm going to do that in the last segment of this hour. And then it goes into Saki again saying that she stands by everything he said when he labeled millions of Americans domestic enemies.
[23:49.000 --> 23:56.000]  So that's where we are. Very, very dark times to say the least.
[23:56.000 --> 24:10.000]  And our only hope before they fully get the technocracy and the robots in charge is they'll follow orders is to get back to God to repent and then to really take stock of the situation.
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  And then to do what the chief scientist of the World Health Organization did.
[24:15.000 --> 24:21.000]  Yeah, I'm sorry. She's not just the other vaccine program. She's the head of their entire global program. She's actually the director.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  Kind of like Dr. Michael Yedon was the head of scientists at Pfizer. That's what she is.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  So she's actually the head of their actual science division. Then you have the WHO political head above her.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  So she's the number of two person at the WHO.
[24:36.000 --> 24:45.000]  And she's telling you in a press conference that you don't want to give children any more of these shots because there's no evidence that helps them and a lot of evidence that does hurt them.
[24:45.000 --> 24:55.000]  And she already knew what a race is your immune system. And then when they get sicker and sicker, they just change the PCR tests they're still using to call the new illness you get COVID.
[24:55.000 --> 25:08.000]  And then you need more shots. And meanwhile, while she's saying this, the head of the WHO, her boss, Kendra's came out.
[25:08.000 --> 25:16.000]  We've got the video here. We'll get to that next segment. And he said, oh, sorry, four shots don't work. You're going to need more shots.
[25:16.000 --> 25:25.000]  But he said, that's probably not the best thing. We'll just reformulate and then give you four of the new one. Ah, busted.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  COVID booster shots diminish immune system, red pill TV, future news dot news, excellent report.
[25:32.000 --> 25:41.000]  You really need to get it from info wars and share it. You want to save people's lives, but you can't share info wars on most platforms, but you can share the video linked in it from future news dot news.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  That's the new URL that they're not blocking. They'll be blocking it. So I'm sure we'll give you a new one. That's how the game works.
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.000]  You won't let them stop you. Future news dot news, future news dot news.
[25:52.000 --> 26:00.000]  We're an info war. You are the muscles in the mind and the guts and the brains and the will and the bones and the vision.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  We are everything. When you take action, we win. When you don't, we fail.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  So fight, fight, fight peacefully with the truth, like your lives depend on it.
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  And realize most importantly that you can be delusional and pretend like you're in the power structure.
[26:18.000 --> 26:25.000]  And that you're going to get away with this, but you're not. Even if the globalists succeed in wiping out the general public, you will be wiped out as well.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  That's historical. That's common sense. That's the way this works. Please turn back now.
[26:31.000 --> 26:38.000]  Please find your soul again. I'm talking to people in the government, people in the corporations, people at the United Nations.
[26:38.000 --> 26:53.000]  I don't know why the chief scientist of the World Health Organization came out 25 months ago and told the truth that vaccines don't work and are maiming people and killing them
[26:53.000 --> 26:59.000]  and that their mainline UN doctors are refusing to give the shots and that no real testing is done.
[26:59.000 --> 27:07.000]  I can surmise that she has a soul and wanted to warn people or I can surmise that their chief scientist doesn't want to go to prison when all this comes out.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  So she's hedging her bets. But whatever she's doing, we don't need to know the motive.
[27:11.000 --> 27:22.000]  We know she's the chief scientist at the United Nations telling you vaccines don't work, telling you they're not doing testing and telling you not to give them to children.
[27:22.000 --> 27:32.000]  And she wasn't just talking about these mRNA garbage. She was saying these vaccine programs where big pharma comes and tells us to do, we don't get any testing, we don't get data.
[27:32.000 --> 27:38.000]  They just say do it and our doctors are refusing to do this because it's, of course, inoculations of real science.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  Of course, you can get immunity from things. Of course, vaccines can be a great technology.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  But the globalists are depopulationists and they're hijacking it and they are putting Trojan horses in it.
[27:48.000 --> 28:04.000]  So I don't know what Dr. Somaya Swam Anahani, Swannam Anahani, is doing this for.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  But I just know she's the chief scientist there and everything she's saying is true.
[28:09.000 --> 28:25.000]  And I know that when she did that two-day conference back in December of 2019, it was 2019, not 2020, Tom's flying, that she looked like she was in front of a firing squad.
[28:25.000 --> 28:32.000]  And when you see these politicians and these world leaders pushing the mandates and the crap, they know what they're doing as criminals.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  Boris Johnson said there's going to be an overthrow of the government of this content using the UK.
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  Well, yeah, you people are overthrowing us. You're starving us. You're cutting our supplies off and making us take dangerous shots.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  If there's a bad disease out there and it's a real vaccine, it works. I'll take it every day.
[28:47.000 --> 28:59.000]  But this isn't a vaccine. This is a gene therapy bio weapon weakening our immune system for the next attack. It's a binary weapon.
[28:59.000 --> 29:09.000]  Christmas 2021 is gone. It's in the rearview mirror. But you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to the new year at infowarstore.com.

[30:03.000 --> 30:04.000]  Hello, Alex.
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[30:05.000 --> 30:13.000]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patreons can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[30:13.000 --> 30:19.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[30:19.000 --> 30:26.000]  Supermell Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[30:26.000 --> 30:33.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions. It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[30:33.000 --> 30:39.000]  It's like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[30:42.000 --> 30:49.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[30:53.000 --> 31:08.000]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  but really, they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels.
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  And I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[31:51.000 --> 32:17.000]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[32:17.000 --> 32:23.000]  It's got concentrated, high quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root, that's so amazing, chaga mushroom,
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[32:29.000 --> 32:36.000]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  It even tastes better than last formula. And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[32:40.000 --> 32:47.000]  And again, it has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[32:47.000 --> 32:51.000]  You're going to love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body,
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  what it does for your bones, it's simply amazing and it helps funding infowar.

[33:20.000 --> 33:37.000]  The list of incredibly prominent scientists of every discipline,
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  from pathologists, to virologists, to epidemiologists, to oncologists,
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.000]  to MDs, to research scientists that have come out and said that they're seeing doubling,
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  tripling deaths 20 times the cancers, massive neurological disorders,
[33:53.000 --> 33:59.000]  off the chart increases in heart attacks.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  And then I've got articles like this coming out every few hours with new scientists
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  and I looked them up and they're just huge, huge, huge individuals.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  MIT scientist says COVID vaccine could trigger neurodegenerative diseases
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  warns parents against vaccinating children.
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  Big article by Don Salazar, update, shock video.
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.000]  Doctor tells patient not to take vaccines because they'll soon be pulled.
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  That's the kind of stuff on infowars.com.
[34:32.000 --> 34:40.000]  And that's what the system is battling around the clock right now to silence and to shut down.
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.000]  So it's such an insane time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  Absolutely over the top.
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  But just imagine and let this sink in.
[34:53.000 --> 35:02.000]  When the head of Pfizer admitted that two shots to three shots basically has almost no protection, if any.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  That's a quote.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  He said if any.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  And you try to share that on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.000]  There's some big articles about it.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  They block it.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  That is the level of Big Tech's merger with Big Pharma, raping our rights,
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  raping our health, assaulting us, totally violating the Nuremberg Code.
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  While they cover their ass and put now in the inserts, they won't show you.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  They can cause heart attacks, blood clots, and all those other forms of death and cancer.
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  And then the UN head scientist says don't give it to kids.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  And the EU government says don't give it to kids, but all the leaders in France and Germany are.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  And the same thing here.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  They go, oh, don't take it.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  Find print.
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  And that's so they don't go to prison when all this happens.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  And every day there's more top athletes take the shot and instantly have heart attacks.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is above my pay grade.
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.000]  And it's about everybody's pay grade.
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.000]  This is demonic worldwide attack.
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  This is the most insane event in human history that we know of.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  There might have been some crazier stuff we don't know about before the history books.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  But this is incredible.
[36:11.000 --> 36:19.000]  And it's the multinational corporations running the governments doing this.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  That's why you can't overthrow a government and fix this.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  You have to overthrow the lies in your mind.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  You have to overthrow the lies in other people's minds.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  You have to stop complying, not complying as the revolution,
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  and then stop the election fraud peacefully and get control of our governments
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  and then start prosecuting and these people will fall like dominoes.
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  But until you realize that all these big corporations are working together
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  and you're going to try to turn the power off, cause riots, you name it,
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  once you realize they're attacking you and they're working together,
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  then it all makes sense and then you can disregard everything they say.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  But if you don't understand it's a full spectrum attack,
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  they're going to keep this health emergency going forever.
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  It's the permanent emergency.
[36:59.000 --> 37:08.000]  Now, this is the chief scientist of the World Health Organization.
[37:08.000 --> 37:17.000]  Dr. Somia Swamin Van said there is no evidence right now
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  that healthy children or adolescents need boosters.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  No evidence at all and that's their way but then they go deeper,
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  just like the EU saying it could cause problems, it could hurt them.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  And then the fine print they admit, microcarditis and a race immune system.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  Here's what she had to say.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  So this question of the boosters is also something that we've been looking at very closely
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  and again we've always said that we will follow the science
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.000]  and what the science is telling us now when we look across the different vaccines
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  that are being used around the world because if you remember there are three aspects
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  that can affect immunity.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  One is the person and their own status, the older you are,
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  the more underlying conditions you have or if you're on immunosuppressive drugs,
[37:57.000 --> 38:03.000]  then your immune system may be weak and so you may need additional help
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  to boost that immune response.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  So it's the biological factors.
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  The second of course is the variant and we've seen starting from the beginning,
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.000]  the ancestral stain, different variants have had different levels of immune escape
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  and with Omicron we know that it has the highest levels of immune escape
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  or immune evasion that we've seen across all of the variants so far.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  Beta and gamma also had that.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  And then the third variable of course is the vaccine itself
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  and there are differences between the different vaccines
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.000]  in how high the antibody response is, how long the protective immunity lasts and so on.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  But again the good thing is that across all of the vaccines,
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  high levels of protection against severe disease.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  That's the outcome we're most interested in, protection against death.
[38:51.000 --> 38:58.000]  Against Omicron, many of the vaccines have shown a reduction in efficacy against infection
[38:58.000 --> 39:04.000]  and that's why we see a lot of breakthrough infections but these are mostly not resulting in severe disease.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  So that's a positive.
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  There is some waning which occurs over a period of time
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  and we've seen that there's a slight drop in the protection,
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  again mostly against infection but also a little bit against the severe disease
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  and we need more of those studies, we need to follow this out
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  and that is why we've said putting all of this together,
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  the aim is to protect the most vulnerable, to protect those at highest risk of severe disease and dying.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  Those are our elderly populations, they may not compromise,
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  people with underlying conditions but also healthcare workers
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  because if a lot of healthcare workers get infected as we see now
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  they can be out sick and we don't want them getting severely ill
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  so to reserve boosters for that population.
[39:51.000 --> 39:57.000]  There's no evidence right now that healthy children or healthy adolescents need boosters,
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  no evidence at all.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  So this is why the SAGE, which is our technical expert body
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  that makes policy recommendations, has been meeting
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.000]  and will continue to meet, will meet later this week to consider the specific question
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  of how should countries think about giving boosters to their populations
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  with a view to protecting people, with a view to reducing deaths
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  and then of course we're looking ahead to the next generation of vaccines
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  that perhaps will block infection more efficiently than the vaccines we have today
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  and then we can think about...
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  Listen any more of this. So what we've got here is...
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  Oh, it does wane a little. No, it completely wanes.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  That for six months you have to immunity.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  That's why they say you have to have it again.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Oh, we need to not look at giving up the kids.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  We don't have any evidence that helps them because it hurts them
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  and that's what the actual literature and the facts show.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  Look at this headline here out of Bloomberg.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  mRNA boosters don't block Omnicron, South African study shows.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  We already knew that. But remember, oh, you've got to take boosters.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  Omnicron, new lockdowns, they knew this.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  They're just calling the common cold COVID now because the common cold is illegal
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  and everybody has a common cold so everybody can be the enemy
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  and that's the pretext for the World Social Credit Score.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  And finally people get it's a World Social Credit Score.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  Finally Fox News had experts ongoing, this is a World Social Credit Score,
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  but it's already here.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  GOP lawmakers demand answers to FDA's troubling COVID booster approval process
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  for children outside of town hall.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  That's all over the news because they had to make the different bodies
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  resign over and over again until they finally got boards that would come after the children.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  And I know people in my own circle, they're like,
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  well, we can't wait until we can give our three-year-old this
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  so they won't ever get it or so lives go back to normal.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  It doesn't go back to normal. It's a trap.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  It's an endless emergency. You've been conned. You've been lied to.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  But instead of admitting you've been conned and lied to,
[42:05.000 --> 42:12.000]  you keep doubling and tripling down on your ignorance.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  You know, I'll hit the martial law news and the Dems plot to prosecute Trump
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  over January 6th prevent him running again and that big breaking news
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  the start of the next hour.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  Because I need to continue and come back with the rest of the COVID takeover news
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  because it's just insane. I got to move as quickly as possible.
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  When we return, news.com.au, the high number of vaccinated people
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  in intensive care in Australia may appear concerning,
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  but it actually shows the jab is working.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  And then, of course, it shows the opposite.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  Unbelievable gaslighting on that front and so much more.
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  And schools are now torturing students who are uninjected
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  and are literally discriminating against them.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  This is how tyranny works.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  to give yourself the gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  all at the same time making yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  by boosting your immune system.
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  are now back in stock.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  Winter sun, the highest quality, vitamin D3,
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  take it under the tongue for higher absorption is back in stock.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  Despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  And then our number one best seller of all time,
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  Survival Shield X2 Deeper Crystal iodine, the game changer,
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  the missing link, not just for immune system,
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  but all electrochemical activity in the body, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  So that's the new year special.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.000]  And that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  at infowarstore.com, 50% off for a limited time.
[43:58.000 --> 44:27.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  We're going to start a fight with Bill Gates.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  They started a fight with you.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  And they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away.
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.000]  They're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  or about globalism or about corporate fascism.
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  And it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  that we have any chance of beating these people.
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has.
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.000]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  And I see the general public in a medically induced,
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  scientifically induced, behavioral psychologically controlled trance.
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist being grounded.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  It's so incredibly sad.
[45:41.000 --> 45:47.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  before they went operational.
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  But we failed.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization.
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  Great reset.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[46:39.000 --> 46:44.000]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets,
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  it's ready to ship right now.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[46:57.000 --> 47:26.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  All right, so here we are, ladies and gentlemen, with a UN World Government Takeover.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  We have a new video out.
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  UN debit cards being given to U.S.-bound migrants, UN-funded invaders.
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.000]  Again, this whole thing, COVID-19, the open borders that collapse the third world.
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  They use the COVID-19 lockdown to starve tens of millions of death,
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.000]  shut down all their businesses and farms, make them migrate here.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  This is nothing but modern warfare.
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  It's how it's all being carried out.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  And Trump did actually stop that.
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  But as soon as Biden got back in, he let the UN program continue yet again
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  with U.S. taxpayer money from UAID.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  That then goes to UN.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  And there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  So they know exactly what they are doing.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  Now continuing, here is the news of Australia.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  The high number of vaccinated people in intensive care in the NSW may appear concerning.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  That actually shows the jab is working.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  Yeah, they say, yeah, it's respiratory problems and blood clots and heart attacks,
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  but that's not related to the jab and it's not normal for that number of people to be there
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  and they are having record hospitalizations, but it's okay.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  Tim Cook's gay.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  So there you go.
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  They explain why half the people in intensive care in NSW are vaccinated.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  It shows the jab is working, that's right, and men can have babies.
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.000]  COVID-19 daily updates in NSW Australia reveal most recent COVID deaths were vaccinated citizens.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  The majority of the COVID deaths were also the vaccinated.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  Oh, but they tell you, first it totally protected you, then it gives you some protection,
[49:06.000 --> 49:13.000]  now they say no protection, but you're just supposed to forget that.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  And then of course, this is back out in the news with new numbers confirming it.
[49:17.000 --> 49:27.000]  Shocking. Analysts of CDC data confirms massive 40% spike in deaths amongst 18 to 49 year olds over the past year.
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  Still unexplained, that's what the big insurance company owner said two weeks ago,
[49:33.000 --> 49:40.000]  was they're seeing a 40% increase in all the countries where people are taking these vaccines, a 40% increase in death.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  And that's passed last year before they started the vaccines.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  So all these trendies on Twitter and Instagram, I see it all over the place, not even looking.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  Alex Jones said we'd all be dead within one year.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  Well, I'm still happy.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  I didn't say you'd all be dead in one year.
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.000]  I said all the top scientists are saying that this killed most of the rats in the studies within six months.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  And their life expectancy is a little bit shorter, a lot shorter than ours are lifespan.
[50:08.000 --> 50:14.000]  So the experts estimated that you might die two, three years on average, we don't know.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  But what we do know is this is happening.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  I'm going to say this again.
[50:18.000 --> 50:26.000]  A 40% increase in a group that is one of the longest lived areas or sections.
[50:26.000 --> 50:40.000]  Working age 18 to 49, the actuary out of the insurance company was 18 to 64.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  But it's showing the same numbers 18 to 49 in that more limited demographic.
[50:45.000 --> 50:53.000]  An analyst for the CDC data that was recently released to the epic times shows that there has been an alarming increase in deaths among 18 to 49 year olds.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  United States over the past year.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  But what's most concerning is the majority of the deaths were reportedly unrelated to COVID-19.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  Of course not. See, it's not COVID.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  It's unrelated.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  Well, you had a heart attack. Well, you had a blood clot. Well, you had a brain clot.
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.000]  Oh, your lungs turned into bloody pulp. You got cancer all of a sudden.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  We just don't know why everybody's dying.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  I mean, Bill Gates said he wants to depopulate you and your family, but now he wants you to take a shot.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  So you live a long time.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  Very important article from GatewayPunna.com.
[51:27.000 --> 51:33.000]  I'm going to have it linked in the live show feed today so you can find it easily at infowars.com and share it.
[51:33.000 --> 51:42.000]  Deaths in this age group, which are traditionally the highest or the healthiest deaths in this age group, which are traditionally the healthiest working age Americans,
[51:42.000 --> 51:52.000]  skyrocketed by more than 40% from October 2020 to 2021 compared to the same period in 2018-2019,
[51:52.000 --> 52:01.000]  which was pre-COVID according to the analyst of death certificate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, by the epic times.
[52:01.000 --> 52:09.000]  There's 42% of the excess deaths included COVID-19 on the death certificate as the cause, as contributing factor.
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  It is not clear the number includes vaccine deaths because they don't count as that.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  The count of vaccine death is a COVID death.
[52:15.000 --> 52:23.000]  The new data almost exactly mirrors what the head of one of the United States largest insurance companies with a whistle on earlier this month.
[52:23.000 --> 52:40.000]  The highest death rate in history, Indiana Life Insurance CEO says deaths are up by a whopping 40% among people aged 18 to 64 in 2021 over only a fraction were COVID deaths.
[52:40.000 --> 52:46.000]  When broke down state by state, the spike in deaths among 18 to 49 year olds is even more than 40% in some places.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  The most dramatic increases is in the South, the Midwest and the West Coast.
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  Meanwhile, the North Eastern states generally saw much milder spikes per ET analyst.
[52:56.000 --> 53:03.000]  Texas, for example, saw 18 to 49 age jump by a whopping 61%, which was the second highest increase in the country.
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  And just 41% of those excess deaths were attributed to COVID.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  And it goes on, it gets even worse.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  So yeah, I'm in a bad mood covering all this, folks.
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  We're seeing massive death increases since the shots started.
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  And here's the video of the head of the WHO saying the shots and boosters don't work.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  So we need a new updated vaccine.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  I'm not going to subject you down to listen to his little slimy mouth talk.
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  But it is certainly completely and absolutely a nightmarish situation we're in.
[53:38.000 --> 53:48.000]  And then that's only a small portion of that news, but I'm going to come back in a little while and get into the police takeover that of course accompanies all of this.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  But Katie, bar the door.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  I want to get to this video, though.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  Shock video.
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.000]  Doctor tells patient not to take vaccines because they'll soon be pulled.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  See the full video on infowars.com.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  Here is the video.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  Go back also say.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  There wasn't enough information.
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  And it's a lot more coming up now and.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  Especially for young people who was.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Immunity is intact.
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  Apparently that's enough.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  Okay.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Okay, so.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  Yes, I'm just sorry.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  Just to make sure you think I shouldn't have any more vaccines.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  If you ask me, this is this would be my advice.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  Okay.
[54:41.000 --> 54:49.000]  And is that just because you don't think anyone should have that vaccine at a young age or is that because you medically I shouldn't have it because of my head.
[54:49.000 --> 55:07.000]  I mean, there is very much as I said to you, there is a lot of information coming up now, which was not available earlier and very soon all of the vaccines will be completely stopped.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  Information that is just really come up.
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.000]  You won't hear it on TV for a while probably because.
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  It's a long story, but yeah, so very soon will stop all of these vaccines.
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  People don't know, but they are not.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  Yeah.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  Yeah.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  Okay.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  Thank you so much.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  You're very welcome.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  And should I be worried about my head at all?
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  Just leave it.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  I don't think so.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  No, I really don't think you should be worried about your head now.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  Okay.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  Okay.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  Thank you.
[55:39.000 --> 55:46.000]  I mean, you know, any sweat, fever, pain, lumps that don't get better.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  Yeah.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  Yeah.
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.000]  Or more to come up or pain in the legs or swelling.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  Yeah.
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  Yeah.
[55:55.000 --> 56:13.000]  Okay.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  Sorry.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  Can I just ask you?
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  So my sister's actually due to go and get her booster tomorrow.
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  She's only 22.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  So should I say?
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  No, absolutely not.
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  Okay.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  Okay.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  All right.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  I'll tell her.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  Thank you.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  And that's in the UK and almost all the medical doctors I talked to have been saying that
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  for a year because they already saw the numbers in England that were a few months ahead of
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  us.
[56:36.000 --> 56:43.000]  The main body in the UK that's regulated by law that it's in control said eight months
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.000]  ago, only about five, six months into the UK injections, stop it now.
[56:48.000 --> 56:55.000]  They yellow carded it and the federal government of the UK said, no.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  They said, no, we're going to get the kids.
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  So folks, you can Mackie of Ellie, look at all the angles of this.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  People say, oh, they just wanted money.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  They didn't know.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  No, Bill Gates ran this.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  They knew damn well what they did.
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  This is going to destroy civilization and the governments are going to get blamed.
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.000]  And Klaus Schwab thinks everybody is so dumb when we have bloody revolutions caused by
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  this. He'll come in and buy everything and put these on the dollar.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  That's in the IMF World Bank documents.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  That's in the plans.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  Greg Pallas first exposed it in 2002.
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  By the way, Greg Pallas was getting quoted by Tucker Carlson two nights ago about all
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  this.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  I want Greg Pallas to on a set.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  It will come on.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  He's a big liberal, but a good liberal.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  And he's dead on about this stuff.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  And so it's a plan to cause unrest and violence.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  Do not be part of it.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  That is the opposite of what we need.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  We got so much news and a huge guest.
[57:46.000 --> 58:15.000]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.000]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy and makes us depressed.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  And therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  When they feel their lie, cheat, steal plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  awakening.
[58:30.000 --> 58:37.000]  Reset Wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep rooted psychological
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  tactics that were being used against me.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  And now I'm not scared anymore.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  I have to say, I was blown away.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  You're absolutely right.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  We are reflections of God.
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  We are emanations of that.
[58:55.000 --> 59:00.000]  And we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this life.
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.000]  Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.000]  And that's a process.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[59:15.000 --> 59:20.000]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort, physically and mentally to
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  reprogram that subconscious mind.
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  mind.
[59:28.000 --> 59:29.000]  He's exactly right.
[59:29.000 --> 59:33.000]  And he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  And I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com.
[59:38.000 --> 59:45.000]  Where your journey begins.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  They gave it to me about 45 minutes ago on the stack.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  I was so busy, I didn't look at the breaking news.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  But I said earlier, Morris Johnson says there's about to be an overthrow of the UK government
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  because they've got spy systems with AI watching everybody and the computer tells them,
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  all right, they're getting ready to burn the country down.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  And they don't want too intense of a breakdown.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  They want a controlled breakdown.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  So they're going to now back off and then reapply.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Watch, they'll reapply the martial law again.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Guaranteed, I know how the enemy operates or AI.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  God gave me AI.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  You've got it too.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  But Morris Johnson into everything.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  But watch, it'll still be all the restrictions.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  They'll call that an end of everything.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  This is how psyops work.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  It's how gaslighting works.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  What did the stewardess say to the man that pulled the mask down and had a drink of water?
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  He said, does it make sense?
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  This is all just theater.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  She goes, it doesn't need to make sense.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  It's about you suspending your common sense.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  So we just got the video.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  It's two minutes long.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  We're going to play it next segment of Boris Johnson saying he's totally suspending everything.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  And we're going to post the articles and video right now into the live show feed and onto infowars.com.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  But you heard the UK doctor and I'm talking about his behind the scenes are being told the same thing that they're going to pull these vaccines.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  But you think, well, that's a victory.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Well, it's in the spars 23 2028 document that this would indeed happen.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  This was done to devastate society and devastate the trust of people and to create so much mental illness after two plus years of this in the left wearing mask wanting shots that they're not going to care they're being abused.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  And they're going to demand more of this and then get past it.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  Those of us that don't want it.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  Okay.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Paul Joseph Watson laid out the prelude to all of this.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  And I want to go ahead and play a little bit of what he had to say, but I don't want to take a victory away from us.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  They're going to press, press, press, press, press until they know we're going to resist and win.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  Then they back off.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  They're going to press, press, press and then back off.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  But don't look for Canada and Australia to back off.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  I think they've got their people where they want them.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson will come back on the other side and lay all this out.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  This is good news.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  And it shows overall we're winning, but we've got to understand now.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  They're going to put the pressure on, remove the pressure.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Here it is.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being warned that he must ditch all rules on face masks or face and even bigger Tory rebellion.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  Mandatory mask rules for venues like cinemas and shops were reintroduced off the back of warnings about Omicron causing 6,000 deaths per day.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  That didn't happen.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  Nowhere near happened because the bedwetting alarmists that advise our government are always wrong.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  In fact, countries like Wales and Scotland, which introduced even stricter face mask measures, recorded higher cases.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  All corona restrictions brought into fight Omicron legally end on January 26.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  The government has indicated that it will scrap most of them, including COVID vaccine passports and work from home advice.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  But some reports suggest they could be quietly planning to keep face mask rules.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Why?
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  The government's own investigation admitted that the evidence for the efficacy of face masks stopping the spread of COVID-19 in schools is quote not conclusive.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  As University of Oxford Professor Jim Naismith pointed out, when England dropped its face mask rule in July, cases dropped.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  Scotland kept their face mask rules and cases spiked higher.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Unless he chooses to completely override the democratic process, Boris needs a new vote in Parliament to keep the face mask mandate.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  And although he can rely on Labour's ever loyal opposition, he faces another humiliating three-figure backlash from Tory rebels.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  One senior Conservative MP warned that the government would be quote mad to pursue an extension of mask rules and predicted it would provoke a rebellion of more than 100 backbenchers.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  He added that keeping such rules in place would be doing the bidding of the same technocrats whose predictions on Omicron were massively inaccurate.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Tory MP Bob Blackman who sits on the 1922 committee executive said quote, I don't see any point in having rules that everyone is ignoring.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  He said that during a visit to a supermarket in his Harrow East constituency last week, half of the shoppers and none of the staff were wearing face coverings.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  The prevarication on mask rules is yet another indication that they're trying to keep face covering mandates in place on a rolling permanent basis.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Primarily as a psychological tool of population control to keep people in an anxiety-ridden state of emergency.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  It must not be allowed to happen.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Tory rebels must make it immediately clear to Boris that along with the odious vaccine passports, face masks have to go.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  They're debanking us behind the scenes.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traders know they can shut us down by force.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  So be it.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  Make them silence us by force.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Give now.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Buy products.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Donate.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're into hour number two and we have huge breaking news that we predicted yesterday.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Boris Johnson has announced an end to all COVID restrictions.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  And then when he actually announced it, it's not an end, just like he did eight months ago.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Put the pressure on, release part of the pressure, but not as much as you did the time before.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Then over time, they're tightening you down, tightening you down, tightening you down, but you feel like you're actually getting your freedoms back by submitting.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  That's right.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Oh, Boris Johnson just said you don't have to do it, but the cities and the left are going to keep it enforced.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  You see how it works?
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  It's a formula of fraud.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  And if you don't get the formula, you will continue to be under its control.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  So UK Prime Minister lifts most COVID-19 restrictions, no mask.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  And they're going to start letting businesses open and stop it.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Oh, but they do want you to have your facts pass.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  If not now, then when UK prepares to inlock down mass mandates, business closures.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Oh, and they say they've ended them all.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  But really, it's already been adopted by most being rolled out.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  They were about to bring in plan B total lockdown again.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  But the government on the left and right came together and said, this is killing our own families.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  It's killing our own children.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  We know it's not working.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  We've all taken the shots and we're sicker than ever.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  What the hell?
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  Just like the head scientist, the UN said, oh, we shouldn't give children these shots.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  There's no evidence they help them because they know it actually hurts them.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  And now Congress, the Republicans have said, hey, you fired a bunch of the FDA and CDC board members last year
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  because they wouldn't approve this for kids.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  They said it wouldn't help them would hurt them.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  We're going to have an investigation.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  That's why next segment I'll get into how the deep states can respond.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Their response is we're going to indict Trump.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  That's what the Democrats committee said.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  They said, we're political.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  We don't want him to run again.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And so we've been told by the Justice Department that Merrick Garland will indict Trump.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  And everybody else that supports him at the top.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  And we're living in like Venezuela or something here.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  And if I thought Trump was still hardcore and that Trump was going to stand up against all the swamp
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  and wasn't pushing these poisonous shots that I told him would be his undoing,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  then I would be willing to back Trump and try to get him back into office.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  But it's not because I'm scared of the deep state.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  It's not because I'm scared of the committee or the Justice Department or any of that,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  that I'm not saying that I'm not going to go to bat for Trump.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  It's because I don't have confidence in him.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  I'll talk more about it coming up.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  And I don't hate Trump and he's still done a lot of good.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And I hope he gets good Republicans elected.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  But more and more, that's not what he's doing.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  It's just that this country can't go into a civil war over Trump.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  We're already going into one over these deadly shots,
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  which Biden says in his terrorism perspective,
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  it's white supremacy to not take your shots into protest.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  What the hell does that have to do with it?
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  The majority of folks, the highest per capita, won't take the shot are black people
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  because they've already been through poisoning vaccines in this country.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Heard of Tuskegee?
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  It's asinine.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  So first you're a racist if you won't take the shot and then now you're a terrorist.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  So it's all one big agenda with Saki saying,
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  he 100% stands by his belief that Republicans are terrorists and domestic enemies.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  And I've got the incredible article with the Democrat chairperson and others saying,
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  we're gonna arrest Trump.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Well, let me just get out of the way of that little move.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  That's gonna blow up in their face so bad.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Look how horrible Biden's been for the Democratic Party.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  Biden is extinct in the Democratic Party and they know that.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  That's why they're going ahead with all this insanity.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Pelosi and Schumer are gonna start a war and try to march the hundred to something thousand
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  Justice Department employees off with the U.S. military against the American people.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  Well, I don't support any of that or either side.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  And I want to be like Switzerland, which means neutral because the Bill Gates,
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Klaus Schwab, behavioral psychologists have set up this Civil War
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  and they want this Civil War and you don't beat them by getting violent on either side.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  But the Democrats are too stupid and they actually think they're in charge
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  and they're being set up to make this horrible move.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  And Napoleon would say, do not interrupt your enemy when they're about to destroy themselves.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  They're not our enemy. They're puppet idiots.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Yes, I hate them. Yes, I can't stand them.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Yes, they're disgusting. Yes, I hope they go to prison.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  But we don't want this giant explosive confrontation right when the world's waking up to the poison shots,
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  right when populism is exploding. This is bigger than America.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  It's about humanity.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Because again, we get in a shooting war with these people.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  That's what they want because that will plunge the economy and then Klaus Schwab's gonna do that
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  and they're gonna turn the power off and say it's a cyber attack.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  That's all laid out. It's all pre-programmed.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  You're gonna be in the dark if they go ahead with this.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  I'm gonna be with solar panels and a trailer house in the woods,
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  but I'm just telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is serious.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  I had Oli Alexanderon, who's a nonviolent, smart guy being sued under the KKK Act of the Democratic Party.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  I'm not joking. A black guy being sued as a KKK for having peaceful demonstrations in D.C.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  And he's like, now, Alex, I still have a right to rebel under the Declaration of Independence
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  because it's fun to sound like you're ready to go.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And I'm sure he is. And I'm not putting Oli down.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Yes, you have a right to rebel when you think it's the right time and that's all you can do.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  I'm not debating that we don't have a right to go after this corrupt system.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  It's the wrong move. Anybody can see that.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  And Oli wasn't calling for that.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  But still, we cannot have there be any perception that we just secretly want this to happen
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  because I don't secretly want it to happen. I don't publicly want it to happen.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I desperately have nightmares about this and wanted to stop.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I have having more anxiety and I'm more upset than I've ever been.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  And my gut is always accurate.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  Maybe it's the war with Russia coming up or maybe...
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  I don't know, but I am just on pins and needles and I know you are too.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Anyways, here's Boris Johnson claiming that they're ending all restrictions, which they're not,
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  but at least it's a psychological victory.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  They're forced to do this because the opposition is building to defeat them,
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  so now they're going to back off for now because the public is waking up.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  So this is overall a victory. If you understand, they're going to try this crap again. Here it is.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  This morning, the Cabinet concluded that because of the extraordinary booster campaign,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  together with the way the public have responded to the Plan B measures,
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  we can return to Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  As a result, from the start of Thursday next week, mandatory certification will end.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  Organisations can, of course, choose to use the NHS COVID pass voluntarily,
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  but we will end the compulsory use of COVID status certification in England.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  From now on, the government is no longer asking people to work from home.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  People should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  and having looked at the data carefully. The Cabinet concluded that once regulations lapse,
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  the government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anyway.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  Mr Speaker, from tomorrow we will no longer require face-masking classrooms
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  and the Department for Education will shortly remove national guidance on their use in communal areas.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  in enclosed or crowded spaces, particularly when you come into contact with people
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  you don't normally meet, but we will trust the judgment of the British people
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  The government will also ease restrictions further on visits to care homes,
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  will set out plans in...
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  I saw this Australian guy on Joe Rogan's show going,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  you don't tell us Aussies what to do, we don't like it.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  It's like saying, don't fight Hitler because you're not German.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  What the hell does that mean? This is a global attack.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  An attack on Australia or an attack on Germany? It's an attack on all of us.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  Then today, us tomorrow.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  This is the final battle of the Information War.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.160]  Victory or death, go down to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:02.960]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:04.360]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:07.560]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:09.800]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:12.440]  that's wild harvested above organic
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:14.880]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:16.920]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:18.440]  that, you know, the media calls communists,
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:19.600]  but really they're just a commune.
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:21.880]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:22.720]  and we've got it.
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:24.880]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:26.640]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.240]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:29.320]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:31.400]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:33.520]  for about 50% more per pound.
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:35.080]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:36.120]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:38.000]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.520]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:42.720]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:46.640]  We had one too.
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:47.640]  I'm not sure if you wanna believe it.
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:50.480]  Anyway, so it's InfowarsStore.com
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:52.200]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:54.800]  And if you don't fund us and don't wanna see it, that's fine.
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:00.200]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:03.280]  for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:05.360]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:07.000]  I wanted to wake up the world
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.200]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:10.920]  before they went operational.
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.000]  But we failed.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.680]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:15.560]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:17.600]  but they are going ahead
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:20.560]  with their full operational deindustrialization
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:21.520]  great reset.
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:23.480]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:25.440]  than all viewers and all listeners
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:27.520]  tell everybody they know about the show
[1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:29.000]  because people are ready to wake up
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.440]  and ready to hear the truth.
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:32.360]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:33.760]  and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:36.000]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.160]  And one of the number one things to do
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:38.600]  is high quality, storeable food.
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:39.520]  We've got the best food,
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:41.800]  ready to ship at very affordable prices
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:43.280]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:45.040]  So whether it's a month or a six month
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:47.120]  or a year supply or specialty diets,
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:48.880]  it's ready to ship right now.
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:51.680]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:53.800]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:56.120]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:58.360]  Get ready at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:01.080]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:03.920]  They're here all over the world from Australia
[1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:06.280]  to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:08.440]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:09.280]  everywhere you go.
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:11.080]  And then coming to your house and threatening
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:14.040]  in some cases actually taking people away
[1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:16.720]  into the night to their facilities.
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:18.360]  And they're planning in the next year
[1:19:18.360 --> 1:19:21.160]  to expand their shield process where they come
[1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:23.200]  and take, quote, healthy people away
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:25.320]  and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:27.080]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:28.960]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:31.280]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:32.920]  many of which are made here in America
[1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:34.160]  and are very compliant.
[1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:36.520]  Meaning US government military grade
[1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:38.280]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:40.560]  We have the entire line of silent pocket
[1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:43.960]  ready to ship to you when you visit InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:45.760]  Again, we have big backpacks.
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:47.320]  We have special dry bags.
[1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:48.600]  We've got them for cell phones.
[1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:50.280]  We've got them for laptops.
[1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:51.120]  We've got them for iPads.
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.640]  It's all there at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:55.520]  So protect your privacy today
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:59.360]  and support the Infowars at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:02.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:05.760]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:18.760]  MUSIC
[1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:24.520]  Anybody telling me that they're bored is nuts.
[1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:28.640]  This is an orchestrated planetary corporate designed.
[1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:31.960]  Slow motion collapse to consolidate power control
[1:20:31.960 --> 1:20:34.680]  and force the population.
[1:20:34.680 --> 1:20:37.160]  Now, there is incredibly positive news unfolding
[1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:38.560]  that I talked about some yesterday,
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:42.040]  but I cannot speak about it enough.
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:44.480]  And Dr. Darren Beatty will not just be joining us
[1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:47.000]  in the next hour for the full hour
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.880]  to talk about the latest January 6th,
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:53.160]  biggest developments yet, the biggest yet.
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:55.520]  He's also going to discuss G.G. Ping,
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:59.200]  Vladimir Putin and major geopolitical realignments
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:01.880]  that have already taken place and already happened.
[1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:04.160]  And why George Soros says G.G. Ping
[1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:06.600]  is the most dangerous man in the world.
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:09.360]  I by no means endorse G.G. Ping.
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:11.800]  I'm simply pointing out there's a very complex
[1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:13.920]  double triple game going here.
[1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:16.240]  And China is paying people now to have three children
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:17.920]  instead of only letting you have one.
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:19.920]  They are breaking with the globalists.
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:21.800]  They're not doing the carbon taxes.
[1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:24.960]  They're not following any of what the New World Order wants.
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:29.200]  And that's what always happens in these evil alliances.
[1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:30.760]  Like in World War I, World War II,
[1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:33.320]  you see different groups are aligned
[1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:35.200]  and suddenly they flip on each other,
[1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:36.920]  like Stalin and Hitler.
[1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:41.000]  So incredibly dangerous time though.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.160]  I don't think I need to tell you
[1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:43.600]  what the Russia situation,
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:46.120]  they say the worst in the history
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:47.600]  of our conflict with Russia,
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:52.840]  except for maybe the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:56.480]  We have just never seen anything like this before.
[1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:00.640]  And so I'd say those prayers a couple extra times a day.
[1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:03.360]  I know I'm saying mine, because I love my children.
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:06.400]  And I just really am praying for peace
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:08.360]  with Russia and China and everybody else.
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:11.040]  And I'm really praying for peace in America
[1:22:11.040 --> 1:22:13.040]  because the globalists have got their bunkers
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:14.800]  and Klaus Schwab says,
[1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:18.800]  angry world, more war, collapsing currencies,
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:22.240]  civil unrest will bring in the greater reset.
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:25.840]  No, thank you, Klaus Schwab.
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:30.840]  No, thank you, so that's coming up.
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:34.640]  But let me do this right now
[1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:36.360]  because I didn't do this last hour
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:38.200]  and this is something that's really a win-win
[1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:40.080]  and something that's very important.
[1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:42.080]  I want listeners to understand something.
[1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:46.080]  I could get a synthetic multivitamin
[1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:49.560]  or a synthetic vitamin C compound
[1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:53.360]  that either does almost no good for you
[1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:55.080]  or does nothing or hurts you,
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:56.360]  depending on your physiology
[1:22:56.360 --> 1:22:58.760]  and what type of synthetic vitamin this is.
[1:22:58.760 --> 1:23:00.400]  You can get a multivitamin
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:03.200]  that is certified daily allowances
[1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:06.600]  and the vitamins cost about the same as the bottle.
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:10.960]  I could get you a bottle of multivitamins
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:13.840]  for about $3 packaged
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:15.480]  and I could sell them to you for 30 bucks
[1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:16.560]  and make a ton of money
[1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:19.240]  and we'd be able to fund ourselves to do that.
[1:23:19.240 --> 1:23:20.960]  I don't do that.
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:23.080]  We go out to the top facilities in the country
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:25.440]  and we say, what is the very highest quality
[1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:27.200]  whole food vitamin?
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:29.520]  Meaning it has to come from actual food, it's organic
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:31.840]  and it's concentrated, so it takes a ton of food
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:35.160]  to get it all down to this base level
[1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:38.520]  and the processes of extracting those vitamins out
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:41.120]  and they got to measure it, get it tested, prove it.
[1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:43.780]  I mean, it's a totally different world.
[1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:46.840]  Whereas, I mean, we've got products
[1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:49.680]  where there's $40 a product in them,
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:52.760]  things like DNA Force Plus.
[1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:55.720]  I mean, that's the highest quality
[1:23:55.720 --> 1:23:58.400]  PQQ in CoQ10 and big juicy doses
[1:23:58.400 --> 1:23:59.280]  with a bunch of other stuff.
[1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:01.600]  I mean, because I'm not gonna sell you this
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:05.240]  and then just make money and do that.
[1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:08.600]  I'm gonna sell you something that I take.
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.480]  Now, can you find whole food vitamins
[1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:13.800]  and minerals and other systems that are as good as ours?
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:15.360]  Yes, there are a lot of great brands out there
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:17.740]  and whatever you do, get them.
[1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:19.480]  But with us, you get a great price
[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:20.520]  for the quality you're getting
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:22.360]  and it funds the Info War.
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:25.200]  You're not gonna get that anywhere else.
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:28.360]  And so, a couple of years ago,
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:31.320]  we could get our multivitamins in anytime we wanted them.
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:33.680]  It's been four, five months since we've had these in,
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:35.760]  I guess longer, I cut out just in four months
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:36.840]  so they corrected me again.
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:38.640]  Hey, boss, it's been eight months.
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:40.680]  I'm like, oh well, whatever, I'm not changing the ads.
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:42.040]  So, it's been eight months.
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:43.080]  I said four months in the ads.
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:45.040]  You'll see the ads start airing tomorrow.
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:46.320]  I shot them last night.
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:49.120]  But eight months since we've had this
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:50.680]  and it was not as big a shipment.
[1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:51.840]  Because we now tell the companies,
[1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:55.960]  okay, when you get enough to do a limited run, do it.
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:58.200]  So instead of doing a run of 20,000 bottles,
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:00.400]  we did a smaller run of 10,000 bottles
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:02.480]  because that's all we can get
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:04.840]  with the supply chain breakdowns and not cut quality.
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:07.740]  I could get synthetic vitamins and minerals
[1:25:07.740 --> 1:25:10.760]  and everything all day long, no problem from the US,
[1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:14.880]  from Mexico, from China, from India, all day long.
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:18.360]  And then we test them with third parties and it's crap.
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:19.800]  We're not gonna do that.
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:23.280]  You have my commitment on my children, on my soul,
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:25.040]  that we're bringing you the very best products
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:25.960]  we can at the best price.
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:27.320]  Everybody already knows that.
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:30.280]  I'm just encouraging all of you ladies and gentlemen,
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:32.520]  that you need to get these products
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:33.800]  and you need to take them.
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:35.400]  Because if you don't have the building blocks
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:37.240]  and the basic defenses for your immune system,
[1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:39.320]  you don't have a prayer in my view.
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:40.280]  And that's not my opinion.
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:42.940]  I mean, if you don't have water, you die in five, six days.
[1:25:42.940 --> 1:25:44.520]  Don't have food, you die in about a month.
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:46.620]  Don't have oxygen, you die in five minutes.
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:49.600]  Well, if you don't have essential vitamins
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:53.080]  and minerals, you just get sickly in about four or five months
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:53.920]  and you die.
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:57.920]  And most disease out there is people deficient
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:00.480]  in vitamins and minerals and other trace elements.
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.800]  Folks who used to always wander out in East Texas
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:07.200]  while all these old black women would outlive their husbands,
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:10.800]  they'd lived back 105 and their husband would die at 50.
[1:26:10.800 --> 1:26:12.360]  Well, their husbands are sort of the white guys
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.480]  that did this too, but my grandma would actually
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:16.760]  go get it sometimes from the black ladies.
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:18.760]  They would go into creek bottoms,
[1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:20.960]  they learned this in Africa and had been passed on
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:24.240]  and dig out certain clays and they would eat the clay.
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:27.800]  Well, it means so do the deer, so do the cows, so the squirrels.
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:31.640]  And they would taste it and smell it
[1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:34.280]  because it had minerals in it and trace elements.
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:38.560]  That's what clay is, is dirt and dust and mud
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:41.240]  mixed with living things over the years,
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:44.140]  over centuries to form clay, that's what clay is.
[1:26:44.140 --> 1:26:48.940]  And those women lived 100 years of age on average.
[1:26:50.700 --> 1:26:52.100]  My dad used to take me and visit them,
[1:26:52.100 --> 1:26:54.220]  women that had been his nannies and stuff,
[1:26:54.220 --> 1:26:56.100]  but the point is, is that they were old women
[1:26:56.100 --> 1:26:59.900]  when they were his nanny because they ate dirt,
[1:26:59.900 --> 1:27:02.740]  ladies and gentlemen, and they had the minerals
[1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:03.780]  and they had the trace elements.
[1:27:03.780 --> 1:27:07.060]  So now they know, oh, there's all these fancy clay tablets
[1:27:07.060 --> 1:27:09.980]  and people take living clay and it's like $1,000 a bottle
[1:27:09.980 --> 1:27:12.460]  and oh, the Hollywood, this is the best living clay
[1:27:12.460 --> 1:27:14.640]  because now they know what the wives knew,
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:17.800]  what the wives tales knew, now everybody knows.
[1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:21.660]  And so, yeah, the men were always making fun
[1:27:21.660 --> 1:27:24.060]  of wives tales, whether it was white men or black men.
[1:27:24.060 --> 1:27:25.060]  And the men are all sitting there,
[1:27:25.060 --> 1:27:27.400]  dying, laughing at the women, eating dirt.
[1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:30.940]  But you see the deer eating the dirt,
[1:27:30.940 --> 1:27:33.300]  you see the wolves eating the dirt,
[1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:34.620]  you see the coyotes eating the dirt,
[1:27:34.620 --> 1:27:36.260]  you see the chickens eating the dirt,
[1:27:36.260 --> 1:27:37.940]  you see the dog eating the dirt,
[1:27:37.940 --> 1:27:42.700]  but dirt that the olfactory nerve picks up
[1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:44.660]  and knows has the minerals in it.
[1:27:45.660 --> 1:27:46.860]  So I'm sure they'll have a big heyday
[1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:49.660]  where there's a jealous, joe says eat dirt.
[1:27:49.660 --> 1:27:52.620]  Yeah, yeah, like there's salt licks,
[1:27:52.620 --> 1:27:54.980]  certain rocks have salt, you'll see deer licking the salt,
[1:27:54.980 --> 1:27:56.980]  you put salt blocks out for your cows.
[1:27:56.980 --> 1:27:59.060]  This is all just common sense folks
[1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:00.940]  and it's why you need these products

[1:28:08.980 --> 1:28:10.780]  or had the minerals in it, not the vitamins.
[1:28:10.780 --> 1:28:12.340]  Actually had some vitamins
[1:28:12.340 --> 1:28:13.900]  because it's got some living matter in it.

[1:31:45.780 --> 1:31:47.220]  as gifts, way out the middle of nowhere
[1:31:47.220 --> 1:31:48.780]  where regular folks don't work, they work,
[1:31:48.780 --> 1:31:53.780]  infowarstour.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020,
[1:31:54.340 --> 1:31:56.180]  and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[1:31:58.220 --> 1:32:00.900]  If you're ruthless mega corporations,
[1:32:00.900 --> 1:32:02.940]  who've taken over almost every government on earth,
[1:32:02.940 --> 1:32:05.500]  and who are trying to destroy the middle class,
[1:32:05.500 --> 1:32:07.700]  and in need form of upper mobility,
[1:32:07.700 --> 1:32:09.460]  you've got to divide and conquer the public
[1:32:09.460 --> 1:32:11.700]  so they don't know they're being targeted,
[1:32:11.700 --> 1:32:14.580]  and that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves,
[1:32:14.580 --> 1:32:17.900]  the name of LBGT, and African American rights,
[1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:20.180]  all the rest of it, all over the world.
[1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:21.380]  That's now their corporate face
[1:32:21.380 --> 1:32:23.740]  while they run slave camps in Africa,
[1:32:23.740 --> 1:32:26.060]  and in Communist China and many other areas,
[1:32:26.060 --> 1:32:28.300]  while they undermine our basic liberties here,
[1:32:28.300 --> 1:32:30.380]  and spy on us through the big tech
[1:32:30.380 --> 1:32:32.660]  and the central banks and other zone.
[1:32:32.660 --> 1:32:34.140]  So this is a criminal takeover,
[1:32:34.140 --> 1:32:37.460]  and when you look at the new super class,
[1:32:37.460 --> 1:32:40.780]  it's the politicians, it's the corporate media,
[1:32:40.780 --> 1:32:42.460]  it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[1:32:42.460 --> 1:32:44.300]  it's members of Congress and their staff,
[1:32:44.300 --> 1:32:46.300]  and their families, it's the White House,
[1:32:46.300 --> 1:32:49.100]  the challenged postal workers who were all exempt
[1:32:49.100 --> 1:32:52.820]  from the poison shots, but not the general public
[1:32:52.820 --> 1:32:55.020]  and everybody else through corporate rule.
[1:32:55.020 --> 1:32:57.620]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[1:32:59.700 --> 1:33:02.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:33:02.500 --> 1:33:06.100]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.100 --> 1:33:10.260]  When I grow up, I want to take you
[1:33:10.260 --> 1:33:14.420]  to the next level, I want to help defeat the New World Order.
[1:33:14.420 --> 1:33:18.100]  I want the interface with God.
[1:33:18.100 --> 1:33:24.100]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center,
[1:33:24.100 --> 1:33:40.100]  in the heart, we now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center,
[1:33:40.100 --> 1:33:44.100]  in the heart of the resistance.
[1:33:44.100 --> 1:33:46.100]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:46.100 --> 1:34:01.100]  All right, glad to be here, love humanity, love you.
[1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:06.100]  What a fight, what a time to be alive right now.
[1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:10.100]  Okay, a lot of horrible news, a lot of really good news,
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:13.100]  what an insane time to be alive, that's all I can say.
[1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:17.100]  We got Dr. Darren Beatty joining us coming up the next hour,
[1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:25.100]  and I really do need to get to some of these video clips
[1:34:25.100 --> 1:34:27.100]  concerning the wheels coming off
[1:34:27.100 --> 1:34:30.100]  of the whole COVID-19 takeover plan.
[1:34:30.100 --> 1:34:32.100]  Now again, they war-gamed in the Rockefeller,
[1:34:32.100 --> 1:34:46.100]  and Carnegie Endowment, and UN documents to execute all of this.
[1:34:46.100 --> 1:34:47.100]  They put that headline back up.
[1:34:47.100 --> 1:34:49.100]  It's not the cruise fault, it's how the show works.
[1:34:49.100 --> 1:34:51.100]  They just throw articles and videos up,
[1:34:51.100 --> 1:34:53.100]  and then I saw it and forgot what I was saying.
[1:34:53.100 --> 1:35:02.100]  Businesses Gorsuch and Sotomayor joined forces to rebuke NPR's fake news mask fight hit piece.
[1:35:02.100 --> 1:35:09.100]  Well, that's good, because the media just makes up whatever it wants.
[1:35:09.100 --> 1:35:14.100]  People need to challenge that, they need to say no to it.
[1:35:14.100 --> 1:35:18.100]  But going back to what I was saying,
[1:35:18.100 --> 1:35:22.100]  the globalists in their different documents,
[1:35:22.100 --> 1:35:24.100]  we've covered here at Nausium,
[1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:26.100]  because unlike mainstream media,
[1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:28.100]  we say something to show you where they said it,
[1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:31.100]  like the Spars document, 2023, 2028,
[1:35:31.100 --> 1:35:34.100]  go rid of yourself for Operation Lockstep.
[1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:38.100]  They say, once people figure out the shot doesn't protect them
[1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:41.100]  and it starts killing them,
[1:35:41.100 --> 1:35:44.100]  we'll just fire some of the agency heads
[1:35:44.100 --> 1:35:47.100]  and blame the government people,
[1:35:47.100 --> 1:35:49.100]  and then there'll be a loss of confidence
[1:35:49.100 --> 1:35:52.100]  and civilization will accelerate its collapse.
[1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:55.100]  I mean, people keep asking how I know all this,
[1:35:55.100 --> 1:35:58.100]  these freaking psychos write all this stuff,
[1:35:58.100 --> 1:36:02.100]  but they call it a battle plan or a futurist analysis
[1:36:02.100 --> 1:36:04.100]  or of different possibilities,
[1:36:04.100 --> 1:36:08.100]  and it's not possibilities, it's what they're doing.
[1:36:08.100 --> 1:36:11.100]  If I was planning to rob a string of banks,
[1:36:11.100 --> 1:36:13.100]  which that's hypothetical, I don't do that.
[1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:15.100]  It'll be Jones says he's robbing banks,
[1:36:15.100 --> 1:36:18.100]  it'll be on CNN tomorrow.
[1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:23.100]  I would say I was writing a novel about how I was going to rob a bank,
[1:36:23.100 --> 1:36:25.100]  and it wouldn't matter later if I got caught with it,
[1:36:25.100 --> 1:36:28.100]  it didn't matter if it was very similar to the actual bank
[1:36:28.100 --> 1:36:31.100]  that had been robbed, I would just say that's a similarity,
[1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:35.100]  but it's not a similarity.
[1:36:35.100 --> 1:36:39.100]  And we've learned when different governments launched terror attacks
[1:36:39.100 --> 1:36:42.100]  to compartmentalize those false flag events
[1:36:42.100 --> 1:36:46.100]  from the rest of their personnel,
[1:36:46.100 --> 1:36:50.100]  they will run a drill of the exact same thing happening
[1:36:50.100 --> 1:36:53.100]  so that the people involved in the attack can all coordinate
[1:36:53.100 --> 1:36:58.100]  with a battle plan, but if they get caught,
[1:36:58.100 --> 1:37:03.100]  they say, oh, this is just a drill on 9-11
[1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:08.100]  that they were doing on 9-10 and 9-11, 2001,
[1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:13.100]  of flying hijacked jets into the World Trade Center,
[1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:17.100]  and all these big drills and NORAD drills that day,
[1:37:17.100 --> 1:37:22.100]  and the Pentagon cancelling a trip of the Pentagon brass,
[1:37:22.100 --> 1:37:26.100]  wait for it, wait for it,
[1:37:26.100 --> 1:37:29.100]  the Pentagon cancelled it the week before, CNBC,
[1:37:29.100 --> 1:37:34.100]  look it up, to the World Trade Center,
[1:37:34.100 --> 1:37:36.100]  this little fact I've forgotten,
[1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:40.100]  they were going to have the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the towers
[1:37:40.100 --> 1:37:44.100]  and the plane went in there.
[1:37:44.100 --> 1:37:46.100]  They weren't even involved, folks.
[1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:50.100]  They planned Flight 93 was supposed to go into the capital.
[1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:53.100]  We even know the Air Force Generals that refused the orders to stand down
[1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:59.100]  and ordered two Sidewinder A-9 missiles.
[1:37:59.100 --> 1:38:01.100]  It's even in the FAA records that they're,
[1:38:01.100 --> 1:38:03.100]  permission to fire, permission to fire,
[1:38:03.100 --> 1:38:06.100]  aim 9, aim 9, and they blow the plane up
[1:38:06.100 --> 1:38:08.100]  because it had been hijacked by remote control,
[1:38:08.100 --> 1:38:10.100]  nerve gas had been released, killing everybody on board,
[1:38:10.100 --> 1:38:13.100]  that's why they created the whole let's roll phone calls and all that,
[1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:15.100]  none of that happened.
[1:38:15.100 --> 1:38:18.100]  They nerve-gassed the plane, took it over with drone control,
[1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:25.100]  they're going to fly it into the U.S. capital.
[1:38:25.100 --> 1:38:27.100]  But the Air Force said screw,
[1:38:27.100 --> 1:38:29.100]  and the Pentagon figured it out too, I'm not defending the Pentagon,
[1:38:29.100 --> 1:38:32.100]  but Pentagon said no to Peter Dazik and Bill Gates'
[1:38:32.100 --> 1:38:37.100]  and a plan to release COVID-19 in 2017 and 2018 in China.
[1:38:37.100 --> 1:38:39.100]  They still did it.
[1:38:39.100 --> 1:38:42.100]  They said the Pentagon was like, what's going on here?
[1:38:42.100 --> 1:38:45.100]  No, I don't think we're going to that conference in New York.
[1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:49.100]  We're supposed to be at the U.N. on September 10th,
[1:38:49.100 --> 1:38:51.100]  and we're supposed to go to the World Trade Center
[1:38:51.100 --> 1:38:59.100]  and visit Wall Street on September 11th.
[1:38:59.100 --> 1:39:03.100]  I mean, you can really see where all this was going
[1:39:03.100 --> 1:39:06.100]  because if you think the deep state almost took over on 9-11
[1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:10.100]  in Los Angeles Wars, can you imagine if a large passenger jet
[1:39:10.100 --> 1:39:13.100]  had flown right into the dome of the capital
[1:39:13.100 --> 1:39:16.100]  and that image of American power, it's a beautiful building
[1:39:16.100 --> 1:39:20.100]  and of Western freedom being, I know it's a whorehouse now,
[1:39:20.100 --> 1:39:22.100]  but it's still a beautiful building.
[1:39:22.100 --> 1:39:24.100]  We're a great country. It's our building.
[1:39:24.100 --> 1:39:27.100]  Just because a bunch of criminals took it over doesn't mean it's theirs.
[1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:31.100]  And can you imagine the dome smashed and destroyed
[1:39:31.100 --> 1:39:34.100]  from a large passenger jet, T-boating it?
[1:39:34.100 --> 1:39:38.100]  It had cut that dome right off there.
[1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:41.100]  And we'd be under martial law today.
[1:39:41.100 --> 1:39:44.100]  But just like January 6th, that the feds provocateur
[1:39:44.100 --> 1:39:47.100]  and hyped up their people and manipulated useful idiots to go in
[1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:50.100]  and they had a thousand-plus FBI, paramilitary all surrounding it
[1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:53.100]  and let it happen, and then there I was trying to stop it.
[1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:56.100]  And I've been asked, like, why'd you try to stop it?
[1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:59.100]  The media sends us messages and we see the emails.
[1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:01.100]  Why don't you, you did try to stop it, Jones,
[1:40:01.100 --> 1:40:05.100]  but why are you so pretentious?
[1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:07.100]  Pretentious?
[1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:10.100]  You know, here in Texas, we have a law, failure to render aid,
[1:40:10.100 --> 1:40:12.100]  and it's also different police.
[1:40:12.100 --> 1:40:14.100]  And Texas isn't perfect. You see articles all the time
[1:40:14.100 --> 1:40:18.100]  in places like Tennessee and Texas and Arkansas
[1:40:18.100 --> 1:40:21.100]  where there'll be cops serving a search warrant on a drug den
[1:40:21.100 --> 1:40:23.100]  and the drug dealers start shooting the cops.
[1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:25.100]  And then a bunch of citizens come out with their guns
[1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:27.100]  and shoot the criminals.
[1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:30.100]  Do the cops turn around and say, you're a little bit uppity here, son?
[1:40:30.100 --> 1:40:34.100]  I mean, what are you doing when I'm getting shot at helping me?
[1:40:34.100 --> 1:40:36.100]  In Texas, if you see a car wreck and people are hurt
[1:40:36.100 --> 1:40:39.100]  and you don't pull over and help them, that's a felony.
[1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:41.100]  And it should be.
[1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:44.100]  I expect you to help me when I'm getting hurt.
[1:40:44.100 --> 1:40:47.100]  It's un-American and I'm not some damn hero.
[1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:49.100]  You know, I've told the story a hundred times.
[1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:51.100]  I remember Rex was only a year and a half old.
[1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:53.100]  We went to a Lomada line.
[1:40:53.100 --> 1:40:55.100]  It's like a French restaurant. It's not fancy.
[1:40:55.100 --> 1:40:57.100]  It's like in between fast food and whatever.
[1:40:57.100 --> 1:40:59.100]  And we were done eating and I went to the bathroom
[1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:02.100]  and I come out and this woman's blue on the table.
[1:41:02.100 --> 1:41:04.100]  And I go, how long has this been going on?
[1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:05.100]  About a minute.
[1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:08.100]  And they're all like parrots saying, call 911.
[1:41:08.100 --> 1:41:10.100]  Call 911. Call 911.
[1:41:10.100 --> 1:41:13.100]  And I finally just go, the police should be dead by then.
[1:41:13.100 --> 1:41:15.100]  So I push the people out of the way.
[1:41:15.100 --> 1:41:19.100]  Do the Heimlich. Big old piece of bread comes out.
[1:41:19.100 --> 1:41:22.100]  And they're all looking at me and they go, oh, you're a hero.
[1:41:22.100 --> 1:41:24.100]  Then the lawyer goes, did he hurt her?
[1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:26.100]  Because I mean, he's a big old fat lady. I had to pick her up.
[1:41:26.100 --> 1:41:29.100]  And I kind of felt a rib break when I was doing it.
[1:41:29.100 --> 1:41:31.100]  So I was like, let's go. Let's go.
[1:41:31.100 --> 1:41:33.100]  Because the nanny state will burn you for helping somebody.
[1:41:33.100 --> 1:41:35.100]  But still I did it.
[1:41:35.100 --> 1:41:37.100]  We were having a rally. We had a permit.
[1:41:37.100 --> 1:41:39.100]  We got there. It was a disaster.
[1:41:39.100 --> 1:41:41.100]  I felt terrible. It wasn't my responsibility.
[1:41:41.100 --> 1:41:44.100]  But it would become my responsibility if I didn't try to get up there
[1:41:44.100 --> 1:41:47.100]  and stop people going in there.
[1:41:47.100 --> 1:41:50.100]  And the left on NPR about a month ago said,
[1:41:50.100 --> 1:41:52.100]  Jones really launched the attack.
[1:41:52.100 --> 1:41:56.100]  And then he got up there to act like,
[1:41:56.100 --> 1:41:58.100]  once it was too late, that he didn't know.
[1:41:58.100 --> 1:42:00.100]  Well, it wasn't too late.
[1:42:00.100 --> 1:42:03.100]  It was an hour later, the red flare went up and actually Babbit died.
[1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:06.100]  And I had military guys with me, you know,
[1:42:06.100 --> 1:42:09.100]  because I hired professionals and police officers.
[1:42:09.100 --> 1:42:11.100]  And they go, a red flare means somebody's been killed.
[1:42:11.100 --> 1:42:13.100]  We got to get out of here.
[1:42:13.100 --> 1:42:15.100]  But I tried and I failed.
[1:42:15.100 --> 1:42:17.100]  But at least I tried.
[1:42:17.100 --> 1:42:21.100]  At least I tried. At least I tried.
[1:42:21.100 --> 1:42:25.100]  Because when I grew up, my dad saw somebody until the point of getting annoying
[1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:28.100]  with a flat tire, he pulled over to help him.
[1:42:28.100 --> 1:42:31.100]  I see somebody with a flat tire. I just keep going.
[1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:33.100]  I'm an angel here.
[1:42:33.100 --> 1:42:35.100]  Because half the time you get mugged doing that now,
[1:42:35.100 --> 1:42:37.100]  but you can see the breakdown of society.
[1:42:37.100 --> 1:42:41.100]  But people in like DC think I'm a space alien trying to stop bad stuff.
[1:42:41.100 --> 1:42:44.100]  And that's why society's falling apart, folks.
[1:42:44.100 --> 1:42:46.100]  All right, I got this huge news when we come back.
[1:42:46.100 --> 1:42:48.100]  Massive news from MIT.
[1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:50.100]  It's so damn important.
[1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:52.100]  Tucker Carlson and so much more.
[1:42:58.100 --> 1:43:01.100]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out
[1:43:01.100 --> 1:43:05.100]  for almost half a year because of supply chain breakdowns.
[1:43:05.100 --> 1:43:09.100]  You've done a great job supporting info wars and supporting your immune system.
[1:43:09.100 --> 1:43:12.100]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the great reset,
[1:43:12.100 --> 1:43:14.100]  we can't get these products in.
[1:43:14.100 --> 1:43:18.100]  So finally, they came in but a limited run of our whole food,
[1:43:18.100 --> 1:43:22.100]  vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient, multivitamins that you absorb it
[1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:25.100]  and so it's not toxic in your body like synthetic vitamins.
[1:43:25.100 --> 1:43:27.100]  And then, of course, vitamin C and zinc.
[1:43:27.100 --> 1:43:30.100]  This sucker is really full and heavy
[1:43:30.100 --> 1:43:34.100]  because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and roseps.
[1:43:34.100 --> 1:43:36.100]  Number one thing you can do if you're immune system
[1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:38.100]  and your body and dose so much more.
[1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:43.100]  Both of these are now back in stock at infowarstore.com for 40% off.
[1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:46.100]  I'm going to keep with that price until they sell out.
[1:43:46.100 --> 1:43:48.100]  Because of supply chain breakdowns, we've got a limited run.
[1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:52.100]  So please take action now and order them at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:52.100 --> 1:43:55.100]  But whatever you do, find similar products out there and use them
[1:43:55.100 --> 1:43:58.100]  because this is a life and death situation to be healthy.
[1:44:02.100 --> 1:44:04.100]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right.
[1:44:04.100 --> 1:44:06.100]  Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:44:06.100 --> 1:44:09.100]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:13.100]  I am a granny and we're all the senior citizens out there
[1:44:13.100 --> 1:44:15.100]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me.
[1:44:15.100 --> 1:44:19.100]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:44:19.100 --> 1:44:22.100]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[1:44:22.100 --> 1:44:25.100]  my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:44:25.100 --> 1:44:28.100]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:44:28.100 --> 1:44:31.100]  And I was already taking your other supplements but I thought,
[1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:34.100]  you know, well maybe that's what I need to do
[1:44:34.100 --> 1:44:36.100]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:44:36.100 --> 1:44:39.100]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:44:39.100 --> 1:44:43.100]  But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[1:44:43.100 --> 1:44:46.100]  okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working.
[1:44:46.100 --> 1:44:48.100]  This is wonderful, you know.
[1:44:48.100 --> 1:44:52.100]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:44:52.100 --> 1:45:21.100]  Anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:22.100 --> 1:45:27.100]  And they're programing for collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[1:45:27.100 --> 1:45:33.100]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[1:45:33.100 --> 1:45:36.100]  And because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow,
[1:45:36.100 --> 1:45:40.100]  because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system,
[1:45:40.100 --> 1:45:44.100]  couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[1:45:44.100 --> 1:45:48.100]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:45:48.100 --> 1:45:49.100]  It's that simple.
[1:45:49.100 --> 1:45:52.100]  We can't beat it because of our free speech and our guns.
[1:45:52.100 --> 1:45:56.100]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[1:45:56.100 --> 1:45:58.100]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:00.100]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:46:00.100 --> 1:46:02.100]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[1:46:02.100 --> 1:46:03.100]  Hello, Alex.
[1:46:03.100 --> 1:46:04.100]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:46:04.100 --> 1:46:06.100]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:08.100]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:46:08.100 --> 1:46:12.100]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[1:46:12.100 --> 1:46:15.100]  Supermail volatility and Brain Force Plus.
[1:46:15.100 --> 1:46:18.100]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:20.100]  Supermail volatility really, really works.
[1:46:20.100 --> 1:46:25.100]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:46:25.100 --> 1:46:29.100]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:32.100]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:34.100]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:46:34.100 --> 1:46:36.100]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:46:36.100 --> 1:46:38.100]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:46:38.100 --> 1:46:41.100]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[1:46:41.100 --> 1:46:43.100]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[1:46:43.100 --> 1:46:45.100]  So it's always good.
[1:46:45.100 --> 1:46:48.100]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:46:48.100 --> 1:47:17.100]  If you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:47:19.100 --> 1:47:25.100]  We're all honored to be here with you as we enter the real crucible heart of the New World Order.
[1:47:25.100 --> 1:47:27.100]  We're now deep into it, my friends.
[1:47:27.100 --> 1:47:30.100]  It's just going to get rougher for me here, but we're going to make it through it.
[1:47:30.100 --> 1:47:34.100]  That's God's promise.
[1:47:34.100 --> 1:47:36.100]  All right, I got a bunch of clips this segment.
[1:47:36.100 --> 1:47:41.100]  Tucker Carlson, again, is one of the only people on national news saying what's happening.
[1:47:41.100 --> 1:47:42.100]  It's a great reset.
[1:47:42.100 --> 1:47:45.100]  The Holy Grail is the global vaccine passport.
[1:47:45.100 --> 1:47:51.100]  Now being implemented all over the planet and in blue cities.
[1:47:51.100 --> 1:47:55.100]  And if our government lets this take over, they're insane because this is how you control the world.
[1:47:55.100 --> 1:48:03.100]  It's a UN corporate cloth swab control consortium that GG Ping built the technology for on record.
[1:48:03.100 --> 1:48:07.100]  International consortium with the Chinese government and the UN runs this.
[1:48:07.100 --> 1:48:12.100]  Trump was worried about Huawei.
[1:48:12.100 --> 1:48:15.100]  This is far worse.
[1:48:15.100 --> 1:48:18.100]  I mean, even if the government wants to dominate, it just wants power.
[1:48:18.100 --> 1:48:22.100]  It ain't the Russians controlling Ukraine and getting their own gas sold to Europe.
[1:48:22.100 --> 1:48:25.100]  It's going to bring down their Anglo-American New World Order.
[1:48:25.100 --> 1:48:32.100]  It's going to be stuff like a world ID controlled by the globalist.
[1:48:32.100 --> 1:48:33.100]  Here it is.
[1:48:33.100 --> 1:48:38.100]  These people are aware of the fact that our constitutional rights are being set aside without an end date.
[1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:44.100]  And that we're heading towards a new system, a tyrannical regime of mass surveillance and control.
[1:48:44.100 --> 1:48:46.100]  And this is not just a hunch.
[1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:48.100]  This is all part of a bigger plan.
[1:48:48.100 --> 1:48:52.100]  This is something people who are watching right now can actually go and look up.
[1:48:52.100 --> 1:48:59.100]  What's very important for the American audience to know is that we've had this digital COVID pass in place in Europe,
[1:48:59.100 --> 1:49:06.100]  which is basically like a QR code on your phone that grants you access to everyday life like to bars, restaurants, etc.
[1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:10.100]  It's completely bind to your VAX status.
[1:49:10.100 --> 1:49:16.100]  And this is all part of a European project issued by the European Commission
[1:49:16.100 --> 1:49:21.100]  that is basically surrounded around this idea of a European digital identity.
[1:49:21.100 --> 1:49:25.100]  So this will not stay just linked to your vaccination status.
[1:49:25.100 --> 1:49:27.100]  This will encompass taxes.
[1:49:27.100 --> 1:49:32.100]  This will encompass your medical records from your vaccination status, your bank information.
[1:49:32.100 --> 1:49:37.100]  So basically, we already have a system in place right now that is very close,
[1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:42.100]  or at least reminds us of the beginning phases of a social credit system.
[1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:45.100]  We are literally turning into China.
[1:49:45.100 --> 1:49:48.100]  We are literally turning into China.
[1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:50.100]  And this has all been public for several years.
[1:49:50.100 --> 1:49:52.100]  It's the battle plan we've been telling you.
[1:49:52.100 --> 1:49:55.100]  And finally, Congress is talking a little bit about it.
[1:49:55.100 --> 1:49:59.100]  And finally, Tucker Carlson is talking about it some, which is great.
[1:49:59.100 --> 1:50:02.100]  And I'm trying to get Joe Rogan to get his mind wrapped around it.
[1:50:02.100 --> 1:50:06.100]  We were at dinner a while back and I just kept explaining to him that it's all the casual society.
[1:50:06.100 --> 1:50:08.100]  It's all the social credit score.
[1:50:08.100 --> 1:50:10.100]  This is everything.
[1:50:10.100 --> 1:50:12.100]  Because I don't want to be the number one talk show host.
[1:50:12.100 --> 1:50:15.100]  I don't care that I'm the first to talk about this stuff.
[1:50:15.100 --> 1:50:20.100]  I just want to beat it because we're literally being enslaved together.
[1:50:20.100 --> 1:50:25.100]  And I just sit here wondering why this is not the top news story.
[1:50:25.100 --> 1:50:29.100]  By the way, we have a clip of the Australian health chief saying,
[1:50:29.100 --> 1:50:31.100]  you must take your boosters.
[1:50:31.100 --> 1:50:33.100]  It's effective against Omicron.
[1:50:33.100 --> 1:50:35.100]  They have a bunch of studies from around the world, including South Africa,
[1:50:35.100 --> 1:50:38.100]  that it actually makes you catch Omicron.
[1:50:38.100 --> 1:50:40.100]  In fact, type that in, guys.
[1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:44.100]  A study shows you vaccinate and catch Omicron easier.
[1:50:44.100 --> 1:50:46.100]  But she's saying it protects you.
[1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:49.100]  She's a freaking liar, man.
[1:50:49.100 --> 1:50:51.100]  But let's go to the next clip.
[1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:54.100]  I talked about this some last few days, but here's Australia running national ads.
[1:50:54.100 --> 1:50:59.100]  Telling you, and for the parts that don't have audio, I'll read the text for radio listeners.
[1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:04.100]  This is a TV ad and informational about how you've got to have this vaccine passport.
[1:51:04.100 --> 1:51:07.100]  And it says it's a social credit score up at the top of it.
[1:51:07.100 --> 1:51:10.100]  So it ain't coming. It's here. Here it is.
[1:51:10.100 --> 1:51:16.100]  This video will show you how to set up your digital identity with MyGov ID.
[1:51:16.100 --> 1:51:22.100]  First, you need to download the MyGov ID app onto your Android or Apple device.
[1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:27.100]  Look for this icon within your app store to make sure you download the right app.
[1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:34.100]  Also, have your identity documents ready and allow yourself enough time to set up your MyGov ID account.
[1:51:34.100 --> 1:51:38.100]  The process can take some time, and you need to have this done correctly
[1:51:38.100 --> 1:51:41.100]  before you can set up your service WA app.
[1:51:41.100 --> 1:51:45.100]  You're literally getting set up at the mark of the beast with total control.
[1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:47.100]  It shows a social credit score in a minute.
[1:51:47.100 --> 1:51:52.100]  This is the Australian government doing this, and it's all based on the approved UN program
[1:51:52.100 --> 1:51:56.100]  from six months ago and runs off the app that the Chinese Communist created.
[1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:57.100]  Continue.
[1:51:57.100 --> 1:52:00.100]  MyGov ID app and start setting up your digital identity.
[1:52:00.100 --> 1:52:05.100]  You can also choose to secure your login using your device's security features,
[1:52:05.100 --> 1:52:08.100]  such as a fingerprint scan or Face ID.
[1:52:08.100 --> 1:52:12.100]  Now you have a MyGov ID with a basic identity strength.
[1:52:12.100 --> 1:52:13.100]  Pause again.
[1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:15.100]  Your basic identity strength.
[1:52:15.100 --> 1:52:17.100]  No, it's a social credit score.
[1:52:17.100 --> 1:52:20.100]  How strong are you?
[1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:24.100]  Remember in the Black Mirror episode, which was based on what they were already setting up,
[1:52:24.100 --> 1:52:27.100]  it was a certain score up to a few thousand, and it was like a pie.
[1:52:27.100 --> 1:52:29.100]  This is your strength.
[1:52:29.100 --> 1:52:31.100]  I mean, you want to be strong, don't you?
[1:52:31.100 --> 1:52:34.100]  Well, what you purchase, what you do is all watch.
[1:52:34.100 --> 1:52:36.100]  You're being surveilled, isn't that great?
[1:52:36.100 --> 1:52:40.100]  Totally illegal, and it's all based on you have your shot, you submit,
[1:52:40.100 --> 1:52:43.100]  and now you do other good things, and your strength level goes up.
[1:52:43.100 --> 1:52:48.100]  In the video game, you see, submitting to the system like that Patton Bill Gates has,
[1:52:48.100 --> 1:52:53.100]  where your every movement is tracked by AI microchips in you,
[1:52:53.100 --> 1:52:58.100]  and if you work like a robot and follow every order, then you get to get food at night.
[1:52:58.100 --> 1:53:04.100]  Why would anyone induct themselves into a slave system of this level,
[1:53:04.100 --> 1:53:09.100]  where you're literally hyperventilating that if you don't act exactly like you're supposed to,
[1:53:09.100 --> 1:53:11.100]  your social credit score goes down.
[1:53:11.100 --> 1:53:13.100]  That's what they're doing.
[1:53:13.100 --> 1:53:16.100]  This is what the left thinks cute and funny,
[1:53:16.100 --> 1:53:20.100]  and they get paid as social engineers and influencers to push this.
[1:53:20.100 --> 1:53:47.100]  Let's continue with the Australian news.
[1:53:47.100 --> 1:53:50.100]  Remember the key to all this is, it's tracking you in live time,
[1:53:50.100 --> 1:53:53.100]  you're opting in, and now Australia's already announced,
[1:53:53.100 --> 1:53:56.100]  you must carry your phone whether you leave your house or you're arrested.
[1:53:56.100 --> 1:53:59.100]  It's your little digital police state minder.
[1:53:59.100 --> 1:54:26.100]  Continue.
[1:54:26.100 --> 1:54:27.100]  Oh, it's so real.
[1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:29.100]  Oh, it's directly from the globalist.
[1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:31.100]  Shut it down.
[1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:34.100]  Same people that launched the whole attack are now behind this.
[1:54:34.100 --> 1:54:35.100]  What a grip of monsters.
[1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:37.100]  They all need to go to prison, and they will.
[1:54:37.100 --> 1:54:40.100]  They're going to keep pushing this and pushing this and putting people in camps,
[1:54:40.100 --> 1:54:43.100]  and mainstream news, the US says, arrest everyone,
[1:54:43.100 --> 1:54:46.100]  London Telegraph, arrest everyone, put them in camps.
[1:54:46.100 --> 1:54:49.100]  They pushed all the way up to camps, camps, camps,
[1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:51.100]  make you take the vaccine, make you have the app,
[1:54:51.100 --> 1:54:54.100]  and in countries where you say no, like the US and the UK,
[1:54:54.100 --> 1:54:57.100]  okay, we're going to stop for now, but where they submit,
[1:54:57.100 --> 1:55:01.100]  it's just all the way.
[1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:04.100]  Submission is death, resistance is victory.
[1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:06.100]  Resistance equals life.
[1:55:06.100 --> 1:55:08.100]  Submission equals death.
[1:55:08.100 --> 1:55:11.100]  When you're on a mission to Mars, and they're setting it up,
[1:55:11.100 --> 1:55:14.100]  and you're on for a year with no gravity,
[1:55:14.100 --> 1:55:17.100]  the strongest man or woman will lose about half their muscles
[1:55:17.100 --> 1:55:20.100]  and more than half their heart strength.
[1:55:20.100 --> 1:55:23.100]  The strongest person.
[1:55:23.100 --> 1:55:26.100]  Gravity makes us strong, it doesn't make us weak.
[1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:28.100]  Pressure makes us strong, not weak.
[1:55:28.100 --> 1:55:32.100]  But when you have no pressure,
[1:55:32.100 --> 1:55:36.100]  when you submit, you are destroyed.
[1:55:36.100 --> 1:55:39.100]  Resistance is life.
[1:55:39.100 --> 1:55:41.100]  Submission is death.
[1:55:41.100 --> 1:55:44.100]  Islam says you must submit to the will of God,
[1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:47.100]  but it's not the will of God, it's the will of the Imams.
[1:55:47.100 --> 1:55:49.100]  And I will not submit to Klaus Schwab,
[1:55:49.100 --> 1:55:51.100]  I will not submit to the Imams,
[1:55:51.100 --> 1:55:53.100]  I will not submit to the Catholic Church,
[1:55:53.100 --> 1:55:55.100]  or the fake Protestant leaders, or any of these people,
[1:55:55.100 --> 1:55:58.100]  I will submit to Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:01.100]  and that's it.
[1:56:01.100 --> 1:56:04.100]  All right, folks, let's go to this quick MIT clip.
[1:56:04.100 --> 1:56:06.100]  MIT Scientist's COVID vaccine could trigger
[1:56:06.100 --> 1:56:09.100]  neurological diseases on Fox News, here it is.
[1:56:09.100 --> 1:56:12.100]  Well-respected MIT Scientist recently gave a presentation
[1:56:12.100 --> 1:56:15.100]  warning of the possible long-term side effects
[1:56:15.100 --> 1:56:17.100]  of the COVID vaccines.
[1:56:17.100 --> 1:56:18.100]  She wrote,
[1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:21.100]  Through the prion-like action of the spike protein,
[1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:23.100]  we will likely see an alarming increase
[1:56:23.100 --> 1:56:27.100]  in several major neurodegenerative diseases
[1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:31.100]  with increasing prevalence among younger and younger populations.
[1:56:31.100 --> 1:56:33.100]  Joining me now is Dr. Stephanie Seneff,
[1:56:33.100 --> 1:56:36.100]  Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science
[1:56:36.100 --> 1:56:38.100]  and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
[1:56:38.100 --> 1:56:42.100]  Dr. Seneff, this is absolutely terrifying
[1:56:42.100 --> 1:56:44.100]  to a layperson to hear
[1:56:44.100 --> 1:56:47.100]  as this push for vaccines and boosters
[1:56:47.100 --> 1:56:50.100]  and new boosters and multiple boosters
[1:56:50.100 --> 1:56:53.100]  for our younger population continue.
[1:56:53.100 --> 1:56:55.100]  What do we need to know?
[1:56:55.100 --> 1:56:57.100]  I, first of all, think it's outrageous
[1:56:57.100 --> 1:56:59.100]  to be giving vaccines to young people
[1:56:59.100 --> 1:57:01.100]  because they don't have a risk,
[1:57:01.100 --> 1:57:03.100]  a very, very low risk of dying from COVID,
[1:57:03.100 --> 1:57:05.100]  so they don't get a benefit.
[1:57:05.100 --> 1:57:09.100]  And when you look at the potential harm from these vaccines,
[1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:11.100]  it just doesn't make any sense.
[1:57:11.100 --> 1:57:15.100]  And certainly repeated boosters is just going to be very devastating,
[1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:17.100]  I think, in the long term.
[1:57:17.100 --> 1:57:20.100]  And it's just, I've done a lot of research
[1:57:20.100 --> 1:57:22.100]  and I really am beginning to understand
[1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:25.100]  exactly how the process takes place,
[1:57:25.100 --> 1:57:27.100]  and it's very disturbing.
[1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:30.100]  Now, the neurodegenerative aspect of this
[1:57:30.100 --> 1:57:32.100]  that you specifically talked about.
[1:57:32.100 --> 1:57:34.100]  All right, folks, we're going to put the full clip in post.
[1:57:34.100 --> 1:57:36.100]  It's also up on infowars.com or on Fox News.
[1:57:36.100 --> 1:57:38.100]  But good for Fox, allowing the truth on.
[1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:40.100]  Because you don't want to sign on the mass murder.
[1:57:40.100 --> 1:57:42.100]  Remember, the head of the UN program came out
[1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:44.100]  and said, don't take the shot.
[1:57:44.100 --> 1:57:46.100]  It's coming off.
[1:57:50.100 --> 1:57:54.100]  Inside you, like me, fire is burning.
[1:57:54.100 --> 1:57:56.100]  Something needs to change.
[1:57:56.100 --> 1:57:58.100]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation
[1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:00.100]  to Reset Wars.
[1:58:00.100 --> 1:58:01.100]  It's really powerful.
[1:58:01.100 --> 1:58:03.100]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing
[1:58:03.100 --> 1:58:06.100]  and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[1:58:06.100 --> 1:58:09.100]  If you want to change your life for the better,
[1:58:09.100 --> 1:58:11.100]  I highly recommend this to Alex.
[1:58:11.100 --> 1:58:13.100]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[1:58:13.100 --> 1:58:15.100]  I found it to be awesome.
[1:58:15.100 --> 1:58:16.100]  It was worth it to me.
[1:58:16.100 --> 1:58:20.100]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge
[1:58:20.100 --> 1:58:23.100]  and crystallized it with scientific craft.
[1:58:23.100 --> 1:58:25.100]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[1:58:25.100 --> 1:58:28.100]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful,
[1:58:28.100 --> 1:58:32.100]  well-documented spectrum of information and experiences
[1:58:32.100 --> 1:58:35.100]  and understanding that the power structure is censoring
[1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:37.100]  and is definitely a trade-off
[1:58:37.100 --> 1:58:40.100]  to think the way we are intended to think by God.
[1:58:40.100 --> 1:58:42.100]  That's what this series is about.
[1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:44.100]  Reset Wars has been a great tool
[1:58:44.100 --> 1:58:46.100]  during this time of uncertainty
[1:58:46.100 --> 1:58:49.100]  and it has rejuvenated my hope.
[1:58:49.100 --> 1:58:51.100]  It's been helping me a lot
[1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:53.100]  with a lot that's going on in my life.
[1:58:53.100 --> 1:58:55.100]  Everybody needs to purchase this product
[1:58:55.100 --> 1:58:58.100]  and watch it and then share the information far and wide.
[1:58:58.100 --> 1:59:00.100]  There is an awakening.
[1:59:00.100 --> 1:59:02.100]  Join in to help yourself
[1:59:02.100 --> 1:59:04.100]  and others to wake up.
[1:59:04.100 --> 1:59:06.100]  Reset Wars has been a great tool
[1:59:06.100 --> 1:59:10.100]  in both recapping what I've come to already know
[1:59:10.100 --> 1:59:12.100]  and also learn new material.
[1:59:12.100 --> 1:59:13.100]  I'm not disappointed.
[1:59:13.100 --> 1:59:15.100]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[1:59:15.100 --> 1:59:17.100]  I hear you coming more and more with that
[1:59:17.100 --> 1:59:19.100]  and I feel it more and more.
[1:59:19.100 --> 1:59:20.100]  It's moving me.
[1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:22.100]  We need to have courage and focus
[1:59:22.100 --> 1:59:24.100]  in order to accomplish that mission
[1:59:24.100 --> 1:59:27.100]  and I felt like I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[1:59:27.100 --> 1:59:31.100]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[1:59:31.100 --> 1:59:33.100]  This isn't magic.
[1:59:33.100 --> 1:59:36.100]  This is the real code of the universe
[1:59:36.100 --> 1:59:40.100]  that Max Planck 120-plus years ago called The Matrix.
[1:59:40.100 --> 1:59:43.100]  Start your journey to true freedom now
[1:59:43.100 --> 1:59:45.100]  at ResetWars.com
[1:59:50.100 --> 1:59:54.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:59:54.100 --> 2:00:20.100]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.100 --> 2:00:24.100]  We've got huge news, not just on January 6th,
[2:00:24.100 --> 2:00:26.100]  but on G.G. Ping and his three-child policy
[2:00:26.100 --> 2:00:28.100]  and so much more with a really smart guide,
[2:00:28.100 --> 2:00:31.100]  Dr. Darren Beatty coming up next segment.
[2:00:31.100 --> 2:00:34.100]  But I wanted to hit this right now
[2:00:34.100 --> 2:00:37.100]  and I wanted to just briefly say this before I play this clip.
[2:00:37.100 --> 2:00:41.100]  Good people see authority, at least in my experience,
[2:00:41.100 --> 2:00:43.100]  as like, well, they must have a plan.
[2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:45.100]  They must have thought it through.
[2:00:45.100 --> 2:00:47.100]  They've got to have some good inclination
[2:00:47.100 --> 2:00:48.100]  and they wouldn't do this.
[2:00:48.100 --> 2:00:50.100]  Psychos and mad men and megalomaniacs
[2:00:50.100 --> 2:00:52.100]  can't stop power grabbing
[2:00:52.100 --> 2:00:54.100]  because they are missing something inside.
[2:00:54.100 --> 2:00:59.100]  Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Mao, Phil Castro, Hugo Chavez,
[2:00:59.100 --> 2:01:00.100]  the list was on and on.
[2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:01.100]  And so we've got it logically.
[2:01:01.100 --> 2:01:04.100]  Keep trying to put logic on why they would do all this.
[2:01:04.100 --> 2:01:06.100]  Why would Bill Gates do all this?
[2:01:06.100 --> 2:01:07.100]  Why would they launch all this?
[2:01:07.100 --> 2:01:08.100]  Because they're psychotics.
[2:01:08.100 --> 2:01:10.100]  Because it's the desire they have.
[2:01:10.100 --> 2:01:12.100]  It's like you hear about sometimes a pit bull
[2:01:12.100 --> 2:01:14.100]  just eats somebody's baby.
[2:01:14.100 --> 2:01:15.100]  Most pit bulls I know are nice,
[2:01:15.100 --> 2:01:17.100]  but statistically there's a small percentage
[2:01:17.100 --> 2:01:20.100]  that are crazy, loco.
[2:01:20.100 --> 2:01:21.100]  And that's what this is.
[2:01:21.100 --> 2:01:23.100]  So I've got Dr. Kerry Grant
[2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:25.100]  because most of these globalists
[2:01:25.100 --> 2:01:26.100]  don't like carrying this out.
[2:01:26.100 --> 2:01:27.100]  They're just ordered to.
[2:01:27.100 --> 2:01:28.100]  She really enjoys it.
[2:01:28.100 --> 2:01:30.100]  She said, it's never ending.
[2:01:30.100 --> 2:01:31.100]  You're going to take all the shots.
[2:01:31.100 --> 2:01:33.100]  You're never going to stop us.
[2:01:33.100 --> 2:01:37.100]  And they had a major, even AP reported this,
[2:01:37.100 --> 2:01:40.100]  major South African study came out yesterday
[2:01:40.100 --> 2:01:43.100]  saying you get more a chance of getting Omicron
[2:01:43.100 --> 2:01:45.100]  if you've had the vaccine.
[2:01:45.100 --> 2:01:47.100]  Not just that Omicron,
[2:01:47.100 --> 2:01:49.100]  or not just the vaccine isn't effective,
[2:01:49.100 --> 2:01:51.100]  you've got more of a chance.
[2:01:51.100 --> 2:01:53.100]  And so the rats are leaving the sinking ship,
[2:01:53.100 --> 2:01:55.100]  but here she is in the video
[2:01:55.100 --> 2:01:57.100]  lying to people saying, no, no,
[2:01:57.100 --> 2:01:58.100]  you've got to have it for this.
[2:01:58.100 --> 2:01:59.100]  But here it is.
[2:01:59.100 --> 2:02:01.100]  Israel finds fourth vaccine
[2:02:01.100 --> 2:02:05.100]  does not effective versus Omicron.
[2:02:05.100 --> 2:02:06.100]  Early Omicron breakthrough
[2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:08.100]  show mRNA vaccines weakness.
[2:02:08.100 --> 2:02:11.100]  And it goes on and on and on.
[2:02:11.100 --> 2:02:15.100]  Pfizer CEO says two COVID vaccine doesn't
[2:02:15.100 --> 2:02:16.100]  aren't enough for Omicron.
[2:02:16.100 --> 2:02:19.100]  He says maybe workless.
[2:02:19.100 --> 2:02:20.100]  Fourth dose.
[2:02:20.100 --> 2:02:25.100]  Israel says MSNBC not good enough.
[2:02:25.100 --> 2:02:26.100]  And it goes on and on.
[2:02:26.100 --> 2:02:28.100]  So this is an endless fraud.
[2:02:28.100 --> 2:02:29.100]  This is a scam.
[2:02:29.100 --> 2:02:32.100]  And it all relies on us not having a memory
[2:02:32.100 --> 2:02:35.100]  and remembering two years ago or a year ago,
[2:02:35.100 --> 2:02:39.100]  or just submitting through the false social contract
[2:02:39.100 --> 2:02:40.100]  and believing it's for our good.
[2:02:40.100 --> 2:02:42.100]  And to get out of this, let's just be tough.
[2:02:42.100 --> 2:02:44.100]  Let's just get it done.
[2:02:44.100 --> 2:02:46.100]  That's how a normal society works.
[2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:51.100]  You don't get through this by submitting to Hitler.
[2:02:51.100 --> 2:02:55.100]  When you submit to Hitler, life gets worse.
[2:02:55.100 --> 2:02:56.100]  When you give up more rights,
[2:02:56.100 --> 2:02:58.100]  the news tightens around your neck
[2:02:58.100 --> 2:03:02.100]  until it's too late because you're hanging and you're dead.
[2:03:02.100 --> 2:03:03.100]  Here's Dr. Kerry Grant,
[2:03:03.100 --> 2:03:07.100]  Australian Health Operative admits people are dying
[2:03:07.100 --> 2:03:08.100]  that have been vaccinated.
[2:03:08.100 --> 2:03:10.100]  In fact, the majority of the dying are the vaccinated.
[2:03:10.100 --> 2:03:11.100]  Here it is.
[2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:12.100]  Up with the team.
[2:03:12.100 --> 2:03:16.100]  Why is there only vaccinated people dying?
[2:03:16.100 --> 2:03:21.100]  So vaccinations work really well.
[2:03:21.100 --> 2:03:26.100]  But they can't protect everyone.
[2:03:26.100 --> 2:03:31.100]  And that's why you need a multiple layers of protection.
[2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:34.100]  And that's why we advise people
[2:03:34.100 --> 2:03:37.100]  to take care of our vulnerable people.
[2:03:37.100 --> 2:03:42.100]  We ask people to take those additional precautions.
[2:03:42.100 --> 2:03:47.100]  So we will tragically still see deaths in individuals
[2:03:47.100 --> 2:03:48.100]  that are vaccinated.
[2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:52.100]  But that doesn't mean the vaccines are so good at protection,
[2:03:52.100 --> 2:03:54.100]  particularly the third dose.
[2:03:54.100 --> 2:03:56.100]  We know that that third dose of vaccination
[2:03:56.100 --> 2:03:59.100]  is critical for Omicron
[2:03:59.100 --> 2:04:01.100]  in increasing the level of protection.
[2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:05.100]  But the vaccines we have available are safe and effective.
[2:04:05.100 --> 2:04:07.100]  And of the 36 people,
[2:04:07.100 --> 2:04:10.100]  33 were vaccinated against COVID.
[2:04:10.100 --> 2:04:13.100]  Generally, they'd had had two doses.
[2:04:13.100 --> 2:04:16.100]  Three people were not vaccinated.
[2:04:16.100 --> 2:04:19.100]  Of the three people who died under 65,
[2:04:19.100 --> 2:04:21.100]  one was vaccinated against COVID.
[2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:26.100]  It had two doses and two people were not vaccinated.
[2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:28.100]  All three of those under 65
[2:04:28.100 --> 2:04:32.100]  had underlying serious underlying health conditions.
[2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:35.100]  And of the older people,
[2:04:35.100 --> 2:04:39.100]  only a handful four had had their boosters.
[2:04:39.100 --> 2:04:41.100]  So can I just echo the Premier's comments?
[2:04:41.100 --> 2:04:43.100]  And I know this will be echoed
[2:04:43.100 --> 2:04:47.100]  by Ms. Pierce in her presentation about the vaccination.
[2:04:47.100 --> 2:05:03.100]  There needs to be a sense of urgency in embracing the booster.
[2:05:18.100 --> 2:05:21.100]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[2:05:21.100 --> 2:05:25.100]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[2:05:25.100 --> 2:05:27.100]  With practically half the population
[2:05:27.100 --> 2:05:30.100]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps,
[2:05:30.100 --> 2:05:33.100]  the traders know they can shut us down by force.
[2:05:33.100 --> 2:05:36.100]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[2:05:36.100 --> 2:05:38.100]  So be it.
[2:05:38.100 --> 2:05:40.100]  Make them silence us by force.
[2:05:40.100 --> 2:05:43.100]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[2:05:43.100 --> 2:05:47.100]  Give now, buy products, donate.
[2:05:47.100 --> 2:05:49.100]  Before everything changes,
[2:05:49.100 --> 2:05:52.100]  we need you to carry us through to the end.
[2:05:52.100 --> 2:05:57.100]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[2:05:57.100 --> 2:06:10.700]  You are now watching The
[2:06:10.700 --> 2:06:16.100]  Alleying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[2:06:16.100 --> 2:06:21.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:21.100 --> 2:06:25.100]  Well a lot of incredible developments taking place.
[2:06:25.100 --> 2:06:30.460]  case, and now even Mitch McConnell talked about it a week ago, Senator Paul's talked
[2:06:30.460 --> 2:06:32.580]  about it, Tucker Carlson's all over it.
[2:06:32.580 --> 2:06:38.780]  The Democratic Party is running on January 6th, and they're saying questioning open borders,
[2:06:38.780 --> 2:06:43.820]  questioning election fraud, questioning lock-downs, questioning forced inoculations is white supremacy
[2:06:43.820 --> 2:06:45.580]  and white supremacy is terror.
[2:06:45.580 --> 2:06:49.620]  That's in the whole June announcement that there's domestic terrorists everywhere and
[2:06:49.620 --> 2:06:54.180]  the new direction isn't Islamic terror, it's not China, it's not Russia, it's not Mexican
[2:06:54.180 --> 2:07:00.620]  drug cartels, it is Trump supporters, and I got a clip on the plane a moment, of Saki
[2:07:00.620 --> 2:07:06.180]  stands by everything he said when he labeled millions of Americans domestic enemies.
[2:07:06.180 --> 2:07:11.900]  So I was there over a year ago in D.C., it was a nightmare, it was a stand down by the
[2:07:11.900 --> 2:07:18.780]  feds, a bare minimum, it was terrible, I tried to stop it, but then a year later to see the
[2:07:18.780 --> 2:07:23.420]  million people that showed up all being told they should go to jail with the Democrats,
[2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:29.060]  and to see everything they're doing being based on that is a big concern.
[2:07:29.060 --> 2:07:34.220]  So here is that clip of Jen Saki defending what Mitch McConnell was talking about when
[2:07:34.220 --> 2:07:36.940]  Biden said the Republicans are domestic enemies.
[2:07:36.940 --> 2:07:43.060]  I want to pivot back to voting rights, particularly the President's speech last week.
[2:07:43.060 --> 2:07:46.780]  I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how it came together, but also I wonder if
[2:07:46.780 --> 2:07:52.020]  you'll respond to some of the criticism about it, that it was too aggressive or divisive
[2:07:52.020 --> 2:07:57.540]  and that some of the rhetoric that he used wasn't conducive to getting folks who are
[2:07:57.540 --> 2:07:59.140]  opposed on board.
[2:07:59.140 --> 2:08:02.700]  Well, sorry, which piece did you want me to start with?
[2:08:02.700 --> 2:08:05.020]  Whichever one is best for you.
[2:08:05.020 --> 2:08:12.460]  Okay, well I would say first that the President delivered a powerful speech about the protection
[2:08:12.460 --> 2:08:18.140]  of people's fundamental rights in this country, which is their right to vote, their right
[2:08:18.140 --> 2:08:22.020]  to vote for anyone they choose, whether it is him or someone else.
[2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:26.620]  It was not a partisan speech, it was intended to lay out for the public exactly what's
[2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:30.580]  at stake and lay out for elected officials what's at stake.
[2:08:30.580 --> 2:08:35.540]  And he stands by everything he said in that speech.
[2:08:35.540 --> 2:08:36.540]  And then I've got the quotes.
[2:08:36.540 --> 2:08:40.660]  I'm going to go to our guests, but you've got the January 6th committee saying, not
[2:08:40.660 --> 2:08:46.500]  a deliberate body, saying the head of the committee suing Trump, saying he premeditated
[2:08:46.500 --> 2:08:50.660]  January 6th, they're giving it all to the Justice Department, they're twisted info,
[2:08:50.660 --> 2:08:53.380]  saying we are going to prosecute Trump to keep him from running.
[2:08:53.380 --> 2:08:59.500]  A purely political statement, unprecedented, I mean, they talk about if you're going to
[2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:01.540]  shoot at the king, you got to hit him.
[2:09:01.540 --> 2:09:07.700]  I mean, this is like third world stuff, unbelievable, read the full transcript at infowars.com.
[2:09:07.700 --> 2:09:13.780]  So Paul Joseph Watson report, he's a political science professor, advised President Trump
[2:09:13.780 --> 2:09:19.180]  has helped him write speeches and work on what's happening and Darren Beatty has a revolver
[2:09:19.180 --> 2:09:23.700]  dot news and we're not going to spend the whole hour on this because he wants to get
[2:09:23.700 --> 2:09:24.700]  into China.
[2:09:24.700 --> 2:09:30.020]  And I really want to hear what his information on this next big story is, but first, the
[2:09:30.020 --> 2:09:34.540]  new developments here and the confirmation that the entire deep state Democratic Party
[2:09:34.540 --> 2:09:38.940]  aparachic is running on January 6th.
[2:09:38.940 --> 2:09:42.180]  What does that signify and where do you think this is going?
[2:09:42.180 --> 2:09:48.140]  Well, it signifies what we should basically already know, which is that the narrative
[2:09:48.140 --> 2:09:55.260]  behind January 6, the narrative purpose of January 6 is crucial to the regime and the
[2:09:55.260 --> 2:09:57.220]  agenda it wants to put forward.
[2:09:57.220 --> 2:10:03.780]  Obviously, part of that agenda is just silencing and clipping its political opposition in the
[2:10:03.780 --> 2:10:08.300]  sense of people who might run against them, but it's actually much more broad than that.
[2:10:08.300 --> 2:10:14.140]  It's about labeling anyone who might vote for politicians who would run against them
[2:10:14.140 --> 2:10:20.740]  as de facto domestic terrorists and of marshaling the full weight and force of America's national
[2:10:20.740 --> 2:10:24.140]  security power to crush their political enemies.
[2:10:24.140 --> 2:10:29.620]  That's ultimately why this January 6 issue is so important and it's why it's so important
[2:10:29.620 --> 2:10:36.020]  to get to the truth of what really happened on January 6 and not the false narrative being
[2:10:36.020 --> 2:10:41.060]  promoted to serve this larger and deeply, deeply dangerous agenda.
[2:10:41.060 --> 2:10:45.580]  Well, that's right, because a lot of my listeners, not the majority, but a big minority is like,
[2:10:45.580 --> 2:10:47.140]  we know you didn't launch the attack.
[2:10:47.140 --> 2:10:48.140]  We know they provocateur.
[2:10:48.140 --> 2:10:49.140]  Shut up.
[2:10:49.140 --> 2:10:50.140]  We know.
[2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:51.140]  It's not about our listeners knowing.
[2:10:51.140 --> 2:10:57.380]  It's about their betting the farm on staging something big in the next 293 days to brand
[2:10:57.380 --> 2:10:59.020]  the Republican Party as terrorist.
[2:10:59.020 --> 2:11:03.540]  I've got quotes of Biden saying there may not be a Republican Party by 2024.
[2:11:03.540 --> 2:11:08.820]  Their wish is to saddle the Republican and populist movement as terrorists and white
[2:11:08.820 --> 2:11:09.820]  supremacists.
[2:11:09.820 --> 2:11:12.140]  I mean, this is the big issue for me.
[2:11:12.140 --> 2:11:13.140]  Right.
[2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:14.140]  Exactly.
[2:11:14.140 --> 2:11:20.780]  And January 6 is a major inflection point and it's an intensification point in the promotion
[2:11:20.780 --> 2:11:23.060]  of this narrative and this agenda.
[2:11:23.060 --> 2:11:25.860]  But the stage has been set for quite some time.
[2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:33.260]  Really the stage has been set ever since 2015-2016 when the national security apparatus began
[2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:39.580]  its operations to undermine and overthrow, really, the Donald Trump presidency, which
[2:11:39.580 --> 2:11:45.980]  you saw throughout the Russiagate issue, and basically killing multiple birds with one
[2:11:45.980 --> 2:11:51.780]  stone because the particular faction within the national security community that was most
[2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:56.300]  actuated against Trump also happened to have an obsession with Russia.
[2:11:56.300 --> 2:12:02.900]  So you kill two birds with one stone by imputing the kind of national security imperative related
[2:12:02.900 --> 2:12:10.020]  to the alleged threat of Russia domestically to the populist threat represented by Donald
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:11.020]  Trump.
[2:12:11.020 --> 2:12:18.420]  And so what you see in January 6 is an evolution of this strategy to kind of marshal the national
[2:12:18.420 --> 2:12:23.420]  security imprimatur domestically for political purposes.
[2:12:23.420 --> 2:12:25.980]  That is the most important thing set on this show in years.
[2:12:25.980 --> 2:12:31.260]  Dr. that is so key that we have a deep state faction that didn't just want to overthrow
[2:12:31.260 --> 2:12:34.620]  Trump, now it's got to overthrow that populist base.
[2:12:34.620 --> 2:12:40.260]  Now it's got to declare war on that American resistance and outlaw the very soul of the
[2:12:40.260 --> 2:12:41.260]  nation.
[2:12:41.260 --> 2:12:42.260]  Right.
[2:12:42.260 --> 2:12:49.420]  And, you know, I said on another video cast on the Tim Poole show, which you've been on,
[2:12:49.420 --> 2:12:53.860]  they were talking about debanking and Mike Lindell being debanked.
[2:12:53.860 --> 2:13:00.580]  And I said, look, this is the domestic analog of what the United States government does
[2:13:00.580 --> 2:13:08.020]  overseas to alleged foreign adversaries, economic sanctions, debanking and financial censorship
[2:13:08.020 --> 2:13:14.620]  domestically is simply the analog of economic sanctions, which we use as a tool of foreign
[2:13:14.620 --> 2:13:15.620]  policy.
[2:13:15.620 --> 2:13:21.940]  I think a lot comes together when you understand the Trump and populism and the broader movement
[2:13:21.940 --> 2:13:27.980]  that he represented in the energies that he stirred up, the kind of amorphous energies
[2:13:27.980 --> 2:13:33.860]  that he stirred up, the national security community considered that as a threat in the same way
[2:13:33.860 --> 2:13:42.500]  that they consider threats in Russia and China and other pockets of geopolitics that threaten
[2:13:42.500 --> 2:13:46.860]  the geopolitical dominance of the American regime.
[2:13:46.860 --> 2:13:49.860]  Dr. Beatty, how do we derail this?
[2:13:49.860 --> 2:13:54.300]  You're a smart guy, by obviously not being violent, not getting caught in their traps.
[2:13:54.300 --> 2:13:55.300]  What else do we do?
[2:13:55.300 --> 2:13:59.020]  I think that major thought leaders, thank God, Mitch McConnell gets it now, which shows
[2:13:59.020 --> 2:14:04.020]  you how serious this is, that the labeling of all opposition as terrorist and as domestic
[2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:07.500]  enemies is a real crime by this regime.
[2:14:07.500 --> 2:14:09.740]  I mean, this is dictator's type of stuff.
[2:14:09.740 --> 2:14:11.900]  This hasn't happened in America really ever.
[2:14:11.900 --> 2:14:12.900]  Right.
[2:14:12.900 --> 2:14:18.660]  It's not compatible with the type of society that these people pretend that America is
[2:14:18.660 --> 2:14:21.980]  but hasn't been for a long time if it ever was.
[2:14:21.980 --> 2:14:30.340]  Once you, it's one thing, it's bad enough to simply call anything, you don't like racist
[2:14:30.340 --> 2:14:37.580]  or sexist, which is still a tried and true trope that the regime uses.
[2:14:37.580 --> 2:14:42.740]  That uses the kind of social stigma of those terms to shut people up, but it's another
[2:14:42.740 --> 2:14:49.340]  level to bring something into the purview of national security because once you say
[2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:54.820]  something is a national security threat, it's no longer a political disagreement, even
[2:14:54.820 --> 2:15:01.020]  an intense and really intensely acrimonious political disagreement that exists within
[2:15:01.020 --> 2:15:04.580]  a normal deliberative democratic sphere.
[2:15:04.580 --> 2:15:09.140]  Once something is a national security threat, all bets are off.
[2:15:09.140 --> 2:15:14.100]  It's just the end of the conversation, the literal sense that it's the end of free speech.
[2:15:14.100 --> 2:15:19.620]  That's why I think this turn toward labeling everything that the regime doesn't like, not
[2:15:19.620 --> 2:15:24.620]  only as racist, conspiracy theory, sexist, the usual words, but now they're national
[2:15:24.620 --> 2:15:25.780]  security threats.
[2:15:25.780 --> 2:15:34.540]  I think we've really crossed a threshold with this into territory that is really sub-democratic
[2:15:34.540 --> 2:15:40.820]  and is a very, very dangerous new chapter in our nation's history.
[2:15:40.820 --> 2:15:41.820]  That's not your opinion.
[2:15:41.820 --> 2:15:42.820]  That's a fact.
[2:15:42.820 --> 2:15:47.300]  That's a declaration of war by the bureaucracy and elements of it against the people when
[2:15:47.300 --> 2:15:49.700]  they can't even win a war in a third world nation.
[2:15:49.700 --> 2:15:50.700]  This is madness.
[2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:53.140]  The only way to win this game, I think, is not to play.
[2:15:53.140 --> 2:15:54.140]  How do we do that?
[2:15:54.140 --> 2:15:55.140]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:55.140 --> 2:16:03.260]  Well, here we are in the year 2022, and Info Wars is now more important than it's ever
[2:16:03.260 --> 2:16:04.260]  been.
[2:16:04.260 --> 2:16:05.260]  We are truly in the zeitgeist.

[2:17:09.100 --> 2:17:10.100]  humanity.
[2:17:10.100 --> 2:17:17.620]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[2:17:17.620 --> 2:17:22.060]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[2:17:22.060 --> 2:17:23.380]  They must first play God.
[2:17:23.380 --> 2:17:30.340]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[2:17:30.340 --> 2:17:31.340]  In a way, they're right.
[2:17:31.340 --> 2:17:37.260]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures,
[2:17:37.260 --> 2:17:38.980]  the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[2:17:38.980 --> 2:17:42.700]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[2:17:42.700 --> 2:17:49.020]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[2:17:49.020 --> 2:17:52.820]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[2:17:52.820 --> 2:17:56.660]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[2:17:56.660 --> 2:18:01.460]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[2:18:01.460 --> 2:18:03.500]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:18:03.500 --> 2:18:09.220]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational,
[2:18:09.220 --> 2:18:10.220]  but we failed.
[2:18:10.220 --> 2:18:11.660]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:18:11.660 --> 2:18:17.460]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[2:18:17.460 --> 2:18:19.820]  deindustrialization great reset.
[2:18:19.820 --> 2:18:24.100]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:18:24.100 --> 2:18:28.700]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:18:28.700 --> 2:18:32.020]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've
[2:18:32.020 --> 2:18:33.820]  also got to get personally prepared.
[2:18:33.820 --> 2:18:36.540]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[2:18:36.540 --> 2:18:41.540]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:45.580]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[2:18:45.580 --> 2:18:47.220]  to ship right now.
[2:18:47.220 --> 2:18:51.940]  Put your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits
[2:18:51.940 --> 2:18:54.420]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:18:54.420 --> 2:18:56.420]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[2:18:56.420 --> 2:19:01.060]  Get our great bag of it here.
[2:19:01.060 --> 2:19:05.220]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:19:05.220 --> 2:19:10.500]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[2:19:10.500 --> 2:19:13.060]  in the volcanic soil, better than watermelon coffee.
[2:19:13.060 --> 2:19:16.500]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[2:19:16.500 --> 2:19:17.820]  but really they're just a commune.
[2:19:17.820 --> 2:19:20.860]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[2:19:20.860 --> 2:19:23.020]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:19:23.020 --> 2:19:26.260]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[2:19:26.260 --> 2:19:27.460]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:19:27.460 --> 2:19:31.820]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[2:19:31.820 --> 2:19:34.300]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[2:19:34.300 --> 2:19:37.860]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:19:37.860 --> 2:19:40.860]  In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[2:19:40.860 --> 2:19:50.460]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:19:50.460 --> 2:19:59.260]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[2:19:59.260 --> 2:20:12.140]  Including upfront all assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:12.140 --> 2:20:30.220]  I'm no stranger to the rain, I'm a friend of thunder, friend is it any wonder a lot of
[2:20:30.220 --> 2:20:31.220]  them strides me.
[2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:43.220]  I fought with the devil, got down on his level, but I never gave in, so he gave up on me.
[2:20:43.220 --> 2:20:49.500]  Darren Beatty, professor, former advisor to President Trump, revolver.news, we're going
[2:20:49.500 --> 2:20:55.660]  to get into China, totally other geopolitical subjects next segment, has been at the tip
[2:20:55.660 --> 2:21:01.460]  of the spear, exposing January 6 and the fact the Democrats are running on that.
[2:21:01.460 --> 2:21:07.260]  But I see Biden's incredible weakness and everyone making jokes about it is not a positive
[2:21:07.260 --> 2:21:08.260]  thing.
[2:21:08.260 --> 2:21:17.420]  I don't want his agenda to pass, but the just incredible arrogance by Saki and him and all
[2:21:17.420 --> 2:21:24.780]  of it is very, very disconcerting, the incompetence and just all of it and their belief they can
[2:21:24.780 --> 2:21:29.940]  hang their hat on calling all their opposition terrorists.
[2:21:29.940 --> 2:21:33.940]  This has heartable political instincts, I don't want to have a war with them, I don't
[2:21:33.940 --> 2:21:37.900]  want to have martial law, I don't want to have a big conflict, but it just has disaster
[2:21:37.900 --> 2:21:38.900]  written all over it.
[2:21:38.900 --> 2:21:43.980]  So, Dr. Beatty, where do you think this is all going and again, what can we do to stop
[2:21:43.980 --> 2:21:44.980]  it?
[2:21:44.980 --> 2:21:51.020]  Well, I mean, I think it's going precisely in the direction that we've been talking
[2:21:51.020 --> 2:21:59.340]  about, the Department of Homeland Security, for instance, even before January 6, the head
[2:21:59.340 --> 2:22:06.780]  of it at the time said, we are basically repurposing our institution from the war on terror to the
[2:22:06.780 --> 2:22:11.300]  war against the number one national security threat in the United States, which is quote
[2:22:11.300 --> 2:22:13.700]  unquote white supremacy.
[2:22:13.700 --> 2:22:19.780]  And various other bureaucracies in our national security apparatus that are sort of looking
[2:22:19.780 --> 2:22:27.500]  for a new home and the aftermath of the war on terror, that sort of that failed chapter
[2:22:27.500 --> 2:22:35.380]  in our nation's history sort of closed with the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan.
[2:22:35.380 --> 2:22:42.100]  And so these institutions need to justify new budgets and what better way to do so than
[2:22:42.100 --> 2:22:47.900]  to participate, become active participants in this full consolidation of the American
[2:22:47.900 --> 2:22:52.300]  regime as an ideological woke state.
[2:22:52.300 --> 2:22:57.620]  And the imperative of the woke state of the globalist American empire is to render anything
[2:22:57.620 --> 2:23:04.740]  that challenges that ideology and the power structure that it sustains as a national security
[2:23:04.740 --> 2:23:05.740]  threat.
[2:23:05.740 --> 2:23:08.900]  So I think that's something that's sort of baked into the cake.
[2:23:08.900 --> 2:23:13.420]  I don't think Biden is particularly, you know, driving that.
[2:23:13.420 --> 2:23:15.380]  I don't really think he's driving anything.
[2:23:15.380 --> 2:23:20.580]  He's sort of along for the ride and at times.
[2:23:20.580 --> 2:23:24.340]  And so I don't really think Biden himself can change the direction on that or anything
[2:23:24.340 --> 2:23:25.340]  else.
[2:23:25.340 --> 2:23:27.180]  That's just kind of baked into the cake.
[2:23:27.180 --> 2:23:33.460]  And of course you have the geopolitical aspect of this is that just as the regime is attempting
[2:23:33.460 --> 2:23:39.420]  to consolidate more and more power along those lines domestically, it's losing more credibility
[2:23:39.420 --> 2:23:40.420]  overseas.
[2:23:40.420 --> 2:23:49.380]  And so it's becoming more and more of a kind of dystopian authoritarian type regime here
[2:23:49.380 --> 2:23:57.500]  and just hemorrhaging our moral authority abroad, hemorrhaging our stature geopolitically
[2:23:57.500 --> 2:24:03.700]  overseas from Afghanistan and now to Russia and, you know, other nations very rightly so
[2:24:03.700 --> 2:24:11.420]  are looking to America as an example of precisely what not to do if you want to be a serious
[2:24:11.420 --> 2:24:16.980]  and ultimately successful nation in the 21st century.
[2:24:16.980 --> 2:24:17.980]  Perfectly said.
[2:24:17.980 --> 2:24:19.220]  And look, I'm Mr. Conspiracy theorist.
[2:24:19.220 --> 2:24:23.480]  I try to project intelligence onto things sometimes that aren't intelligence.
[2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:27.300]  We know there's powerful groups trying to be intelligent, but putting in Biden who can
[2:24:27.300 --> 2:24:33.140]  barely talk, having arrogant sake up there, I get the systems like, oh, let's just decredit
[2:24:33.140 --> 2:24:37.180]  nation states, let's make people look bad.
[2:24:37.180 --> 2:24:39.900]  But this is just off the rails.
[2:24:39.900 --> 2:24:43.260]  Do you think the Biden administration knows how much trouble they're in?
[2:24:43.260 --> 2:24:47.300]  Not just here, but as you said internationally, I mean, this is a joke and I'm not laughing
[2:24:47.300 --> 2:24:52.980]  because I love America to see our president be a puppet to see arrogant, crazy SJW is
[2:24:52.980 --> 2:24:54.740]  running press conferences.
[2:24:54.740 --> 2:24:56.740]  This is like a hallucination.
[2:24:56.740 --> 2:24:57.740]  Right.
[2:24:57.740 --> 2:25:05.060]  Well, it's really a question of the time scale in which these entities are really thinking
[2:25:05.060 --> 2:25:06.060]  about things.
[2:25:06.060 --> 2:25:14.180]  I think in the short term, what this amounts to for the regime is a consolidation and intensification
[2:25:14.180 --> 2:25:15.820]  of power domestically.
[2:25:15.820 --> 2:25:22.860]  It's an attempt to consolidate this new form of the American regime as an ideological state
[2:25:22.860 --> 2:25:28.540]  that embraces wokeness, which is not a precisely defined term, but it works, that embraces
[2:25:28.540 --> 2:25:35.580]  wokeness more or less in a way that functions like in China embracing the CCP.
[2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:41.020]  If you're a business enterprise in the United States or any other kind of institution at
[2:25:41.020 --> 2:25:47.900]  the highest level, if you don't embrace or play ball with wokeness, you cannot exist.
[2:25:47.900 --> 2:25:52.980]  Similarly, in China, if you don't play ball with the party, you cannot exist.
[2:25:52.980 --> 2:25:53.980]  It's the same thing.
[2:25:53.980 --> 2:25:59.140]  It's just a different institution with sort of different agenda.
[2:25:59.140 --> 2:26:00.140]  Exactly.
[2:26:00.140 --> 2:26:03.820]  It's a political litmus test or a pledge of allegiance to it.
[2:26:03.820 --> 2:26:04.820]  Exactly.
[2:26:04.820 --> 2:26:10.780]  And so I think in the short term, it could make sense for the elements surrounding Biden,
[2:26:10.780 --> 2:26:18.220]  but I think as the United States completes its transformation into the globalist American
[2:26:18.220 --> 2:26:24.100]  empire and this ideological woke state that we're talking about, it really does sacrifice
[2:26:24.100 --> 2:26:26.820]  its position geopolitically.
[2:26:26.820 --> 2:26:31.180]  We've published a piece that I think is really important and provocative at Revolver News
[2:26:31.180 --> 2:26:39.820]  that basically dispels this wishful thinking myth of quote unquote, go woke, go broke.
[2:26:39.820 --> 2:26:44.340]  That is not true domestically and in fact, if you're not woke, you cannot play at the
[2:26:44.340 --> 2:26:47.140]  highest level in the United States.
[2:26:47.140 --> 2:26:53.460]  But there is a lot of truth to that in the broader geopolitical sense that as the United
[2:26:53.460 --> 2:27:01.500]  States becomes a woke ideological state, it is hemorrhaging its capital in a geopolitical
[2:27:01.500 --> 2:27:08.980]  context and that I think is a huge story in the relative rise of China and some other
[2:27:08.980 --> 2:27:16.940]  geopolitical entities and the relative decline of the United States in the 21st century.
[2:27:16.940 --> 2:27:23.900]  And that's so important there and be here with us because this is it.
[2:27:23.900 --> 2:27:28.940]  America's real power was the Renaissance and freedom and a real open society and example
[2:27:28.940 --> 2:27:29.940]  of the world.
[2:27:29.940 --> 2:27:34.860]  But if they can get America to entrench itself and be authoritarian, then it loses all its
[2:27:34.860 --> 2:27:39.620]  real power and then we're just three hundred and forty million people were not that shining
[2:27:39.620 --> 2:27:41.460]  sitting on the hill.
[2:27:41.460 --> 2:27:47.860]  And so that's really that, you know, the trick we're in a little mermaid, Melesophant tricks
[2:27:47.860 --> 2:27:52.300]  her to give up her voice saying now you'll be a human, you'll be able to get your boyfriend.
[2:27:52.300 --> 2:27:55.620]  But really, her voice was her soul, it was her power.
[2:27:55.620 --> 2:27:59.060]  And the minute you give up that voice, the minute you join the evil, now you're just
[2:27:59.060 --> 2:28:00.060]  another country.
[2:28:00.060 --> 2:28:01.780]  Now you have no power.
[2:28:01.780 --> 2:28:03.280]  Exactly.
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:06.260]  And I think that that's what's going on.
[2:28:06.260 --> 2:28:08.180]  And I mean, it's not the only factor.
[2:28:08.180 --> 2:28:16.660]  It's not like I think wokeness in many ways is a symptom of underlying problems in the
[2:28:16.660 --> 2:28:20.780]  American regime, maybe even more so than it's a cause.
[2:28:20.780 --> 2:28:25.420]  But in a way, there's interactions effects such that now it's both.
[2:28:25.420 --> 2:28:26.420]  But stay there.
[2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:29.140]  We're going to come back and talk about that again into China, because that's where you've
[2:28:29.140 --> 2:28:33.140]  got new news breaking on that and revolver dot news and we're really focusing on that.
[2:28:33.140 --> 2:28:36.660]  I think that's really smart to do because Xi Jinping and Putin not going along with the
[2:28:36.660 --> 2:28:37.660]  New World Order.
[2:28:37.660 --> 2:28:40.860]  That is the biggest political movement in decades and needs to be looked at and we'll
[2:28:40.860 --> 2:28:42.380]  talk about it so much more.
[2:28:42.380 --> 2:28:45.340]  And how do we move away from Biden?
[2:28:45.340 --> 2:28:49.380]  Is there any way what happens in 2022 and beyond 2024?
[2:28:49.380 --> 2:28:55.100]  It's all coming up with Professor Darren Beatty of revolver.news on Alex Jones of info wars.
[2:28:55.100 --> 2:29:03.780]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[2:29:03.780 --> 2:29:10.980]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic terrorism.
[2:29:10.980 --> 2:29:14.780]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[2:29:14.780 --> 2:29:17.460]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[2:29:17.460 --> 2:29:20.780]  They are now defanking us behind the scenes.
[2:29:20.780 --> 2:29:26.620]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly with practically half the population
[2:29:26.620 --> 2:29:29.660]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[2:29:29.660 --> 2:29:34.680]  The traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening
[2:29:34.680 --> 2:29:36.180]  exponentially.
[2:29:36.180 --> 2:29:37.180]  So be it.
[2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:40.140]  Make them silence us by force.
[2:29:40.140 --> 2:29:43.140]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[2:29:43.140 --> 2:29:44.140]  Give now.
[2:29:44.140 --> 2:29:45.140]  Buy products.
[2:29:45.140 --> 2:29:46.140]  Donate.
[2:29:46.140 --> 2:29:47.140]  Before everything changes.
[2:29:47.140 --> 2:29:51.740]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[2:29:51.740 --> 2:29:57.180]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[2:29:57.180 --> 2:30:03.980]  In late August, info war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[2:30:03.980 --> 2:30:10.340]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[2:30:10.340 --> 2:30:13.460]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:16.780]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[2:30:16.780 --> 2:30:17.780]  us.
[2:30:17.780 --> 2:30:22.180]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration,
[2:30:22.180 --> 2:30:24.460]  self defense and a relationship with God.

[2:30:36.980 --> 2:30:41.300]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[2:30:41.300 --> 2:30:42.620]  already taking place.
[2:30:42.620 --> 2:30:48.900]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:48.900 --> 2:30:52.780]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self sufficient and not under their
[2:30:52.780 --> 2:30:53.780]  control.
[2:30:53.780 --> 2:30:57.220]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:57.220 --> 2:31:02.620]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply
[2:31:02.620 --> 2:31:04.340]  chain breakdowns.
[2:31:04.340 --> 2:31:07.900]  You've done a great job supporting info wars and supporting your immune system.
[2:31:07.900 --> 2:31:11.940]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the great reset, we can't get these products
[2:31:11.940 --> 2:31:12.940]  in.
[2:31:12.940 --> 2:31:18.780]  So finally, they came in but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential,
[2:31:18.780 --> 2:31:23.580]  nutrient, multivitamin so you absorb it and so it's not toxic in your body like synthetic
[2:31:23.580 --> 2:31:24.580]  vitamins.
[2:31:24.580 --> 2:31:26.500]  Then of course vitamin C and zinc.
[2:31:26.500 --> 2:31:32.420]  This sucker is really full and heavy because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and
[2:31:32.420 --> 2:31:33.420]  roseps.
[2:31:33.420 --> 2:31:37.140]  Number one thing you can do if you're immune system and your body, it does so much more.

[2:31:59.780 --> 2:32:01.780]  Your voice counts.
[2:32:01.780 --> 2:32:06.780]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:32:06.780 --> 2:32:09.380]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:32:09.380 --> 2:32:10.880]  They know you're angry.
[2:32:10.880 --> 2:32:15.180]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:32:15.180 --> 2:32:16.180]  we've got.

[2:32:59.460 --> 2:33:09.020]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:09.020 --> 2:33:14.020]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:14.020 --> 2:33:19.700]  All right, former Trump advisor, professor, political science, good university, went on
[2:33:19.700 --> 2:33:26.100]  to serve again at the Trump White House, speech writer, policy aide, revolver.news at Darren
[2:33:26.100 --> 2:33:29.340]  J. Beatty, Dr. Beatty's here with us.
[2:33:29.340 --> 2:33:35.780]  So this is an endorsement of Vladimir Putin, it's a real politic analysis, like you're
[2:33:35.780 --> 2:33:40.860]  looking at a risk board about who's got the power, who's up and coming, who's declining.
[2:33:40.860 --> 2:33:45.060]  And the globalists have parlayed American power into China and other places, give themselves
[2:33:45.060 --> 2:33:50.180]  incredible wealth, and they have a real chip on their shoulder against American Christianity
[2:33:50.180 --> 2:33:53.340]  or Western ideals, the left doesn't like that.
[2:33:53.340 --> 2:33:58.180]  But that was the real power base, so they've debased it.
[2:33:58.180 --> 2:34:05.460]  But how do you quantify then looking at the rise of China and Russia getting out of the
[2:34:05.460 --> 2:34:12.780]  Western control and where this is all going, because it's a big, big deal and whereas the
[2:34:12.780 --> 2:34:17.180]  left wants to kind of come and dominate the political elite, the American people, if they
[2:34:17.180 --> 2:34:20.740]  just left us alone, we'd be fine, they could still be in charge.
[2:34:20.740 --> 2:34:24.140]  We're the easier enemy to beat, instead they're starting a fight with China, they're starting
[2:34:24.140 --> 2:34:32.580]  a fight with Russia, and Xi Jinping is shifting from being a leftist colony to be exploited
[2:34:32.580 --> 2:34:36.300]  to being an independent nation, not defending what he does or any of that, but we could
[2:34:36.300 --> 2:34:40.980]  go over it saying have three children instead of having one child, saying we want masculine
[2:34:40.980 --> 2:34:47.700]  men, we reject what America does, even though China then funds Hollywood spewing the exact
[2:34:47.700 --> 2:34:48.940]  same message.
[2:34:48.940 --> 2:34:52.780]  So there's a lot there to unpack, Dr. Beatty, you're gonna be back home with us soon to
[2:34:52.780 --> 2:34:56.900]  really lay this out, you're gonna be reporting on at Revolver, you told me a few nights ago
[2:34:56.900 --> 2:35:00.740]  on this in depth, and I agree with the direction you're going in, because really it's a big
[2:35:00.740 --> 2:35:05.260]  deal about what's happening in China, what's happening in Russia, and why are they at least
[2:35:05.260 --> 2:35:10.380]  on the surface breaking with the globalist system, what does that signify?
[2:35:10.380 --> 2:35:18.820]  Well, it signifies a lot of things, and I think, you know, the issue is very complicated
[2:35:18.820 --> 2:35:24.140]  and really doesn't really come through at the retail level in the way that people talk
[2:35:24.140 --> 2:35:33.580]  about China and Russia in everyday discourse, but I think I guess the most important place
[2:35:33.580 --> 2:35:40.220]  to start with China is to look at the various factions within the American power structure
[2:35:40.220 --> 2:35:42.740]  and their relationship to China.
[2:35:42.740 --> 2:35:48.940]  I think in a nutshell, what's happened is it is true that the American elite, American
[2:35:48.940 --> 2:35:54.060]  ruling class over the past several decades, basically sold out to China, which by the
[2:35:54.060 --> 2:35:59.220]  way is not ultimately China's fault, do we blame China or do we blame the elites that
[2:35:59.220 --> 2:36:00.220]  sold out to China?
[2:36:00.220 --> 2:36:05.980]  This was a very important, very simple point that Trump made repeatedly, it's not China's
[2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:14.780]  fault that our leaders are stupid and corrupt and short-sighted and basically whores, and
[2:36:14.780 --> 2:36:20.820]  they whored out the country to China for short-term gain, and there's no question about that,
[2:36:20.820 --> 2:36:26.340]  and that is shameful, and we're sort of paying the price for that now.
[2:36:26.340 --> 2:36:33.340]  But I think you see a shift in sort of strategy and incentives across the board within the
[2:36:33.340 --> 2:36:35.620]  American power structure.
[2:36:35.620 --> 2:36:42.340]  During the time that we were selling out to China, China was not perceived as a great
[2:36:42.340 --> 2:36:43.340]  threat.
[2:36:43.340 --> 2:36:49.340]  It was perceived really as a country that once it achieved a certain level of material prosperity,
[2:36:49.340 --> 2:36:55.940]  it would of course embrace democratic liberalism, which means it would basically admit itself
[2:36:55.940 --> 2:37:01.140]  to the condition of vassalage to the United States.
[2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:05.580]  And they would have their male children's penises removed as a liberal ritual.
[2:37:05.580 --> 2:37:07.940]  Exactly, and China said the opposite.
[2:37:07.940 --> 2:37:12.740]  That would be the extension of their material prosperity and their economic integration
[2:37:12.740 --> 2:37:15.140]  into the global system and so forth.
[2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:21.060]  It's basically a version, a permutation of the same end of history thinking that got
[2:37:21.060 --> 2:37:24.980]  Russia all wrong, which is another important story.
[2:37:24.980 --> 2:37:30.700]  But the case with China was they gained the material prosperity, and the entities that
[2:37:30.700 --> 2:37:38.180]  sold out to China got rich in the short term, but then China became a formidable force such
[2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:45.100]  that China became a formidable force just at the same time that there wasn't really,
[2:37:45.100 --> 2:37:48.700]  there was diminishing returns on the sellout to China.
[2:37:48.700 --> 2:37:53.500]  There's only so much arbitrage you can do before you get diminishing returns in that
[2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:54.500]  respect.
[2:37:54.500 --> 2:38:01.420]  And so gradually over time, I think we crossed this threshold where the selling out to China,
[2:38:01.420 --> 2:38:05.900]  you could get less and less bang for your buck, less and less milk out of that teat.
[2:38:05.900 --> 2:38:11.460]  And at the same time, China transformed from this just kind of third world, second world
[2:38:11.460 --> 2:38:21.500]  sort of sweatshop that will build plastic stuff to sell here to a real geopolitical force.
[2:38:21.500 --> 2:38:26.860]  And somewhere along those lines, the calculus changed from, okay, China is a place that
[2:38:26.860 --> 2:38:34.660]  we can sell out to increase the spoils of the rulers of the American regime to China
[2:38:34.660 --> 2:38:42.020]  is now a threat because it is a competitor for the spoils globally.
[2:38:42.020 --> 2:38:48.060]  And I think that inflection point has been crossed probably several years ago.
[2:38:48.060 --> 2:38:54.220]  The military industrial complex faction of the American regime is all in on this new
[2:38:54.220 --> 2:38:56.660]  Cold War with China.
[2:38:56.660 --> 2:39:01.620]  Corporate America is, if not all in, they're mostly in.
[2:39:01.620 --> 2:39:08.300]  And that's because, again, the diminishing returns from arbitraging to China have kicked
[2:39:08.300 --> 2:39:09.300]  in.
[2:39:09.300 --> 2:39:15.700]  And also these corporations realize the threat to their existence from continuous and severe
[2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:22.180]  intellectual property theft from China, which sort of pushes them over to the military industrial
[2:39:22.180 --> 2:39:23.980]  complex side.
[2:39:23.980 --> 2:39:28.820]  This faction of the American ruling class that's always been most favorable to China
[2:39:28.820 --> 2:39:33.460]  is, of course, the financial industry in Wall Street, which is still, I would say, on the
[2:39:33.460 --> 2:39:36.060]  whole favorably disposed to China.
[2:39:36.060 --> 2:39:43.660]  But now they don't have the corporate faction and the military industrial faction on board.
[2:39:43.660 --> 2:39:51.780]  And in light of 2008, Wall Street actually suffered a pretty profound decline in prestige
[2:39:51.780 --> 2:39:58.700]  and importance relative to the other factions of the American regime's ruling class.
[2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:04.580]  And so, considered as a whole with the different factions of the ruling class, now you basically
[2:40:04.580 --> 2:40:12.420]  have an alignment that more or less weights toward an aggressive and antagonistic competitive
[2:40:12.420 --> 2:40:14.100]  posture with China.
[2:40:14.100 --> 2:40:18.820]  And I think that really accounts for the new rhetoric that you're seeing across the board
[2:40:18.820 --> 2:40:25.700]  that seems to propel us into a Cold War 2.0 with China.
[2:40:25.700 --> 2:40:30.060]  And just as that's happening, just as this transformation that I was talking about of
[2:40:30.060 --> 2:40:38.540]  American regime transforming into a full ideological woke state, you see China looking at the condition
[2:40:38.540 --> 2:40:42.980]  of the United States and saying, this is no longer an example of what we should copy.
[2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:46.300]  It's an example of precisely what we should avoid.
[2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:55.060]  And then you see China aggressively rejecting wokeness and China's rejecting quite smartly
[2:40:55.060 --> 2:41:01.700]  the vehicles through which the woke virus is transmuted.
[2:41:01.700 --> 2:41:05.020]  And one of the chief vehicles for that is big tech.
[2:41:05.020 --> 2:41:12.780]  And China has made the very wise decision to ban Google and ban American big tech generally.
[2:41:12.780 --> 2:41:14.500]  And Doc, that's a really key point you make.
[2:41:14.500 --> 2:41:19.860]  He gave a speech like a year ago, early last year, that was picked up by the Chinese press
[2:41:19.860 --> 2:41:23.740]  where he said, look at how they banned Donald Trump on Twitter.
[2:41:23.740 --> 2:41:25.540]  Look, they're the enemy.
[2:41:25.540 --> 2:41:27.260]  He said, literally, it's these corporations.
[2:41:27.260 --> 2:41:31.060]  That's not something that's easy, pink's good, but he understands the real power is these
[2:41:31.060 --> 2:41:32.860]  corporations and the technocracy.
[2:41:32.860 --> 2:41:36.460]  And that's got a really, that's why George Soros now calls him the most evil man on earth
[2:41:36.460 --> 2:41:38.420]  because George Soros is in the middle of that.
[2:41:38.420 --> 2:41:39.420]  Right.
[2:41:39.420 --> 2:41:42.900]  And George Soros is somebody who is a fascinating figure.
[2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:48.740]  And for all of his faults, you know, the, I think the most formidable force now in the
[2:41:48.740 --> 2:41:50.500]  West is mediocrity.
[2:41:50.500 --> 2:41:56.780]  And so I have to at least give George Soros credit for being sort of a legacy dinosaur
[2:41:56.780 --> 2:42:00.500]  who genuinely is a talented and remarkable figure.
[2:42:00.500 --> 2:42:01.500]  No, no, no, I agree.
[2:42:01.500 --> 2:42:05.180]  He is definitely not not not mediocrity.
[2:42:05.180 --> 2:42:14.580]  Soros basically invented a certain model of translating financial means into political
[2:42:14.580 --> 2:42:20.220]  power and influence through the construction of various NGOs that are integrated with the
[2:42:20.220 --> 2:42:23.660]  government that are integrated with his financial contacts.
[2:42:23.660 --> 2:42:31.340]  He is a key instrument and key innovator in leveraging the color revolution model of exercising
[2:42:31.340 --> 2:42:32.980]  political influence.
[2:42:32.980 --> 2:42:39.740]  And of course, one of the vectors for that model in the digital age is American big tech,
[2:42:39.740 --> 2:42:47.860]  the use of various tech platforms to gin up these mobs that become the vectors.
[2:42:47.860 --> 2:42:48.860]  Not to be there.
[2:42:48.860 --> 2:42:52.580]  I want to come back and talk about where you see this coming next because the battle lines
[2:42:52.580 --> 2:42:53.580]  are all drawn.
[2:42:53.580 --> 2:43:00.300]  Who are the major players will be back Christmas 2021 is gone.
[2:43:00.300 --> 2:43:05.620]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to

[2:43:58.940 --> 2:44:04.340]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[2:44:04.340 --> 2:44:08.420]  happening in the atmosphere, but if you look at all the different studies reports about
[2:44:08.420 --> 2:44:13.020]  NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[2:44:13.020 --> 2:44:14.020]  with the client.
[2:44:14.020 --> 2:44:19.820]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[2:44:19.820 --> 2:44:24.540]  So yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[2:44:24.540 --> 2:44:27.860]  back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't
[2:44:27.860 --> 2:44:31.860]  really happen the way they wanted it to, okay now it's just climate change, but did you
[2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:37.700]  know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations
[2:44:37.700 --> 2:44:42.460]  and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN, they have weather control treaties
[2:44:42.460 --> 2:44:47.380]  for 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[2:44:47.380 --> 2:44:51.900]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[2:44:51.900 --> 2:44:54.620]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[2:44:54.620 --> 2:44:57.980]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[2:44:57.980 --> 2:45:00.820]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:45:00.820 --> 2:45:05.140]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:45:05.140 --> 2:45:11.100]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[2:45:11.100 --> 2:45:14.780]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[2:45:14.780 --> 2:45:19.740]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:45:19.740 --> 2:45:23.860]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[2:45:23.860 --> 2:45:28.140]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:45:28.140 --> 2:45:30.420]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[2:46:02.020 --> 2:46:03.020]  back in stock.

[2:46:08.460 --> 2:46:14.020]  not synthetic, and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel
[2:46:14.020 --> 2:46:18.340]  Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your body.
[2:46:18.340 --> 2:46:24.300]  They're both back in stock, sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[2:46:24.300 --> 2:46:29.060]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep
[2:46:29.060 --> 2:46:30.060]  us on air.
[2:46:30.060 --> 2:46:36.620]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic, whole food,
[2:46:36.620 --> 2:46:39.620]  multivitamin, and take vitamin C and take zinc.
[2:46:39.620 --> 2:46:43.700]  We also have some great vitamin D products at infowarstore.com as well, but whatever
[2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:48.540]  you do to fend your body's immune system, we want to keep patriots in the game against
[2:46:48.540 --> 2:46:49.540]  the new world order.
[2:46:49.540 --> 2:46:53.780]  So 360 win, hit something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and
[2:46:53.780 --> 2:46:59.100]  your immune system while funding the InfoWar at infowarstore.com.
[2:46:59.100 --> 2:47:08.300]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:08.300 --> 2:47:29.780]  All pirates, yes they rob I, sold I to the merchant ships, minutes after they took I,
[2:47:29.780 --> 2:47:41.580]  sold I to the merchant ships.
[2:47:41.580 --> 2:47:44.520]  All right, Professor Darren J. Beatty is here with us, revolver.
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:48.860]  This is the first of a lot of big discussions about China.
[2:47:48.860 --> 2:47:51.660]  What's happening really in the world, but Xi-Zi Ping is broke instead of we're having
[2:47:51.660 --> 2:47:52.660]  three kids.
[2:47:52.660 --> 2:47:54.620]  We're not going to have sysys on TV.
[2:47:54.620 --> 2:47:56.480]  We're not going to teach transgenerous.
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:47:59.120]  We're rejecting everything that the West is doing.
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:05.720]  has really upset the power structure. So, Doc, let me ask you this. We have the
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:10.640]  Anglo-American establishment, the U.S. and kind of England, but that's all set up
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:14.840]  NATO, the other EU kind of has its own thing, but those two are incestuous. You
[2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:20.400]  got Russia as the wild card, you've then got China, and then of course we have
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:23.800]  Latin America and Africa and other countries in Asia like Japan. They're
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:29.800]  kind of, you know, just the orbit of the general superpowers, but clearly by bad
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:34.080]  leadership America is disintegrating because our own ruling class doesn't
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:39.560]  want us to be independent because they want to control us. So, how does the
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:43.560]  DABOS group that acts like it's everybody's friend, but it's really, I see
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:48.640]  as a corporate specter-like group that tries to use the chaos to get more
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:52.000]  power and control, and we've seen the big corporations that support the DABOS
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:57.080]  group increase their wealth 99% under the lockdowns. I think it's pretty clear
[2:48:57.080 --> 2:49:01.640]  out of all these power structures, it's the multinational opportunity,
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:07.800]  opportunistic corporations that are the biggest enemy. What do you think?
[2:49:07.800 --> 2:49:15.520]  Well, I don't know. I think there's a lot of enemies to go
[2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:21.720]  around. I don't know if I would say the corporate power sector is the worst of
[2:49:21.720 --> 2:49:25.360]  the enemies. I think the military industrial sector, which of course
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:30.920]  overlaps. There's a lot of overlap between these networks and these sectors,
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:35.680]  and although the sectors have different interests, and different multinationals
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:41.200]  have different interests. For instance, certain multinationals are going to be
[2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:47.440]  more favorable to China relative to others that now have basically-
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:52.760]  Sure, so how would you divide up the world, and who's winning the geopolitical game right now?
[2:49:52.760 --> 2:50:00.960]  Well, I think it depends on our unit of analysis. If the unit of analysis is
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:06.160]  sort of nation-state or even more broadly sort of the civilizational model
[2:50:06.160 --> 2:50:12.440]  that like Sam Huntington used, whether it's the United States or the West, I
[2:50:12.440 --> 2:50:18.880]  think definitely the United States and West are in relative decline
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:25.680]  geopolitically, and China is not. I think China is ascendant. Does that mean
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:30.080]  that China doesn't have any systemic problems? Does it mean that China will
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:36.360]  ultimately come out to be the clear victor and leader in the 21st century?
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:40.840]  I think that's yet to be determined, but I certainly think it's fair to say all
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:46.440]  things considered that China is ascendant and the globalist American
[2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:53.640]  empire geopolitically is in decline, and I think there's one sort of intangible
[2:50:53.640 --> 2:50:59.200]  factor that is really important, and that is the psychology of the nation. I think
[2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:07.680]  what I gathered most from talking to Chinese individuals of various social
[2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:14.280]  stratas, there's really a dominant psychology of ascendancy in China, which
[2:51:14.280 --> 2:51:20.800]  I think counts for a lot. In the United States, right after our great victory in
[2:51:20.800 --> 2:51:25.040]  World War II, there was a similar psychology of ascendancy that sustained
[2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:29.160]  the baby boom generation and so forth, and I think there's...
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:33.680]  And I agree that was around Americana and real American liberal values, which isn't
[2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:38.360]  liberal today. In China, it's an ethno-state. I mean, let's just say it, this is an
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:44.640]  ethnic state. Right, it's an ethnic state, and so in many ways it just doesn't fit
[2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:49.120]  into the kind of vocabulary that we use to demonize them. Even on the right, we
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:52.880]  say, oh, these are just a bunch of communists. We use the same terms to
[2:51:52.880 --> 2:51:57.760]  demonize China as we do to demonize Antifa, but when you actually look at, you
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:03.840]  know, ideologically and functionally what these entities are, Antifa is functionally
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:10.360]  the paramilitary force for the American regime, which is this woke ideological
[2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:16.800]  state, and China is anything but. It is anything but woke, and in some ways I
[2:52:16.800 --> 2:52:20.840]  would even go so far as to say it is anything but ideological. I think at
[2:52:20.840 --> 2:52:26.000]  this stage, China is marked more than anything by a kind of ruthless
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:31.440]  pragmatism that informs all of their. And that's why it now realizes family and men
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:35.320]  and powerful structures is power, and that's got to really freak the left out
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:38.960]  if they want to sabotage the whole world with this anti-human garbage and
[2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:43.360]  China is now moving and in Russia is moving against it as well. That's got
[2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:48.440]  to really freak out the Hollywood elite. Absolutely, and look, there are many ways
[2:52:48.440 --> 2:52:53.280]  to be anti-human. I think China is anti-human in some profound ways, but
[2:52:53.280 --> 2:52:57.720]  it's not woke. It hasn't embraced that particular. It's not attacking it at the
[2:52:57.720 --> 2:53:05.160]  human base of ending families. Not in the way that is dominant in the West for
[2:53:05.160 --> 2:53:10.400]  sure. And I think, you know, in line with the psychology of ascendancy that I think
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:16.280]  predominates in China, at least at the kind of elite levels or the levels where
[2:53:16.280 --> 2:53:23.520]  it matters, there really is a underlying seriousness. She is a serious leader in
[2:53:23.520 --> 2:53:31.200]  the way that no Western leader really is. China has deep flaws,
[2:53:31.200 --> 2:53:35.360]  you know, certainly morally, but also just functionally. It has systemic
[2:53:35.360 --> 2:53:41.240]  problems, but is a serious country. And I think it's no longer justified to say
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:45.680]  that the United States is a serious country and that it has serious leaders.
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:52.160]  There's a certain kind of clownishness that characterizes the political process.
[2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:56.840]  How do you see the crazy kleptocratic, neurotic, schizophrenic leaders of the
[2:53:56.840 --> 2:54:01.160]  West that hate their own power base? How do you see them countering China now and
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:11.240]  also Russia? Well, I don't really. At this stage, like in the full analysis, I just
[2:54:11.240 --> 2:54:17.960]  don't see the globalist American empire outcompeting China. Well, yeah, what
[2:54:17.960 --> 2:54:22.760]  empire turns its coal off and its oil and gas off? I mean, Russia and China are
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:27.000]  we're increasing natural gas. We're increasing fossil fuel. We have unlimited
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:31.920]  supplies of coal. Again, like what elite cuts its own power off? Like the elite
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:35.640]  running things here like are saying, we're not open for business. But we're
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:38.920]  but while we cut off our own power to our own people, we're going to tell you
[2:54:38.920 --> 2:54:44.800]  what to do. Here's the here's the bind that the American regime's ruling elite
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:52.040]  are in right now. And that is that in order to set America on a footing that
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:57.560]  could actually be competitive with China, this would presuppose such profound
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:55:03.240]  changes within the United States that it would threaten the position of America's
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:07.880]  ruling elite. And so the ruling elite, if they want to outcompete China, they
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:13.800]  basically have to jeopardize their own status as the ruling elite, which they
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:20.120]  won't do. And because of that sort of strategic dynamic, I simply don't see
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:24.200]  those changes happening on a timescale that would allow us to outcompet.
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:30.920]  Because I agree. They need 1950 America 2.0 that was doing civil rights and was
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:35.600]  feeling invincible and was expanding and innovating. If they brought back 1776
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:39.640]  red, white and blue, NASA, America, everybody starving for it, we would
[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:44.080]  explode. The world would know we were open for business. We would be dominant.
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:48.560]  But the globalists just can't let anybody have any power under them.
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:53.600]  Exactly. That's exactly the case. And that's why things don't look good at all
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:57.560]  in terms of their prognosis for the 21st century. But you never know, you can
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:02.160]  never count, you know, you can never count true America out. And that's why I'm
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:07.560]  fighting for it. And that's why you're fighting for it. And, you know, the
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:12.080]  future is not yet written in that regard. So is there any way to get the leftist
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:15.920]  globalists to not cut their nose off despite their face? Is there any way to
[2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:19.600]  get them to knock it off and just go with prosperity, go with success, get back to
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:26.320]  our biological mission instead of playing God? I don't think there's any easy
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:30.960]  solution for that. I think the globalist American Empire might have to sustain
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:37.080]  fairly profound humiliations that would force a fundamental reconsideration of
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:42.720]  a course correction that could set us on a real footing for the 21st century.
[2:56:42.720 --> 2:56:46.400]  How about a deal with China and Russia? Everybody just to work together in giant
[2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:49.440]  projects and go to space? I mean, that would be a lot better than all this,
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:55.040]  wouldn't it? That would be that would be interesting. Yeah, the space program is
[2:56:55.040 --> 2:57:01.640]  that's a whole separate discussion and a whole separate host of humiliations for
[2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:06.160]  the United States are kind of space prospects. Come back soon. Let's have
[2:57:06.160 --> 2:57:09.440]  more geopolitical discussions with Dr. Darren J. Beatty. He's actually a smart
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:12.640]  guy. I know what he's talking about. Roll over, not news. Thank you so much, Doc.
[2:57:12.640 --> 2:57:17.480]  Thank you. Thank you. All right, folks. We got another guest host coming up here in
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:21.240]  the fourth hour. Jason Burmes is extremely smart. Good friend of mine.
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:24.720]  Look forward to that. And I got a few things to say in the next final segment.
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:33.000]  But we're talking about real issues here, folks. There is a evil force working
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:36.840]  against humanity and against all of us, whether you're Russian, Chinese or
[2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:41.520]  American. We better come together and say no to it and build a pro human future.
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:42.120]  We'll be right back.
[2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:51.240]  Hey, employers. If you're like me, you've been a longtime listener of this program
[2:57:51.240 --> 2:57:55.880]  and you've fed up with everything going on in the world. Inside you, like me, a
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:58:00.960]  fire is burning. Something needs to change. And yet we feel helpless, almost
[2:58:00.960 --> 2:58:05.120]  like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us. It's time
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:10.000]  for us to break free from that system. Race at war is a game changer. You start
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:14.680]  to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:19.760]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy and makes us
[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:23.080]  depressed, and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there. When they
[2:58:23.080 --> 2:58:27.520]  feel their lied sheets deal plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an
[2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:33.920]  awakening. Reset Wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock on to
[2:58:33.920 --> 2:58:38.240]  the deep-rooted psychological tactics that were being used against me. And now
[2:58:38.240 --> 2:58:43.680]  I'm not scared anymore. I have to say I was blown away. I feel so much better
[2:58:43.680 --> 2:58:47.400]  every day listening to it. To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course
[2:58:47.400 --> 2:58:52.800]  together. You're absolutely right. We are reflections of God. We are emanations of
[2:58:52.800 --> 2:58:57.240]  that and we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this
[2:58:57.240 --> 2:59:01.360]  life. Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of
[2:59:01.360 --> 2:59:05.840]  our mind. And that's a process. Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[2:59:05.840 --> 2:59:09.360]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things. You can
[2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:13.480]  drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip. In this process,
[2:59:13.480 --> 2:59:17.640]  we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to
[2:59:17.640 --> 2:59:22.680]  reprogram that subconscious mind. That's what this series is about, is resetting
[2:59:22.680 --> 2:59:26.760]  our mind. Because there's a war on for our mind. He's exactly right. And he's
[2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:31.400]  become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening. And I
[2:59:31.400 --> 2:59:35.840]  encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com.
[2:59:35.840 --> 2:59:47.680]  That's where your journey begins.
[2:59:47.680 --> 2:59:57.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:59:57.680 --> 3:00:08.800]  Texas is about to get hit like much of the southeast with a huge ice storm
[3:00:08.800 --> 3:00:13.880]  tomorrow. And luckily, thanks for your support. We got a big-ass generator and a
[3:00:13.880 --> 3:00:18.960]  backup. So we'll try to stay on air. It was rough about 11 and a half months ago
[3:00:18.960 --> 3:00:23.160]  in February of last year, as you remember. So we're here hunkered down. It's like
[3:00:23.160 --> 3:00:28.000]  70 degrees outside. It'll probably be 20 degrees by tomorrow. But we're gonna be
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:33.880]  tracking all that. But what an interview we just did. What an interview. What a
[3:00:33.880 --> 3:00:39.000]  breakdown. These globalists hijacked it run America. Don't even see America's
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:43.080]  power to their power. Like, I've got an incredible horse. It's beautiful and
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:46.600]  healthy and amazing. I don't think, well, that horse has got bigger muscles than me.
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:51.560]  I think that's my horse. But they don't even want to be the people riding the
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:54.880]  horse. They want to kill the horse because they're jealous of it. So here's
[3:00:54.880 --> 3:01:00.200]  this article. From prison threats to fines, how the world is turning up the
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:04.040]  heat on the unvaccinated. London Telegraph. Articles everywhere. It's time to
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:09.360]  arrest the people that don't take the shot that doesn't work. And I've seen so
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:12.000]  many videos the last few weeks of kids out in the freezing rain because they
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:16.120]  won't take the shot. And kids that won't wear their mask, you know, being locked up
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:20.000]  or being put outside in the freezing cold. That's what you do at prison camps.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:24.880]  That's a violation of the Nuremberg Code again, and the Geneva Convention. New
[3:01:24.880 --> 3:01:28.880]  West Charter School, LA, caught abusing young, ex-fitted girls,
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:35.680]  un-injected girls, denied chairs forced to sit outside on pavement, not allowed to
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:41.880]  use restrooms because they hadn't taken their shots. It's all big pharma wanting
[3:01:41.880 --> 3:01:45.800]  to rape these little girls with poison injections that'll destroy their
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:50.160]  ovaries and destroy their future. Get out of the schools. Who cares? There's no
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:54.160]  government. There's no future anyways. There won't be colleges in the future
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:58.040]  under this. They'll be, you know how to fix a carburetor. Do you know how to grow
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:01.880]  crops? Do you know how to raise a child? Do you know how to suture a wound? Do you
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:06.160]  know how to pull a tooth? And all the major industries in the West are being
[3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:11.960]  destroyed. All the major systems of thought. This is the post-industrial world.
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:16.080]  Ever wanted to know what it looks like? This is it. Here's some video of the
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:20.160]  girls kept outside segregated because they haven't taken the poison shot in
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:26.240]  complete violation of the Nuremberg Code. Dr. Mingala is very proud. Hello, my name
[3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:30.000]  is Ellen Ahum, and I'm a student at New West Charter School, and I'm here with
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:34.440]  five other girls. Four of them are freshmen, one is a junior, and I'm a
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:39.520]  sophomore. And we're being threatened to be suspended because we don't have the
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:44.560]  COVID-19 vaccine, and we're being refused of the right to attend school. We feel
[3:02:44.560 --> 3:02:50.200]  segregated and discriminated, and we're being closed off by this caution tape-like
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:56.160]  thing. We're being segregated from the rest of the school. Yeah. And for radio
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:00.160]  listeners, you can't see the police walking around. It's all funny to them. I
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:05.200]  mean, this is, folks, this isn't like a one on a tyranny scale. It's like a ten.
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:13.720]  And they're just wholesale pushing it as hard as they can. And now that you
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:18.200]  announced, hey, sorry, four shots ain't enough. In fact, it's unlimited. It's six
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:25.720]  to ten shots a year. Bill Gates said almost two years ago it would be seven
[3:03:25.720 --> 3:03:30.760]  to ten shots a year. He told the shareholders, he said, it's a permanent
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:39.400]  business. They're going to be so sick. Wow. You see, this isn't like all the other
[3:03:39.400 --> 3:03:44.400]  compliance you do in society. Because before, most compliance was about a
[3:03:44.400 --> 3:03:51.240]  social contract. That was kind of a leftover system, where maybe it was hit
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:56.400]  or miss. But most of the social contract was really about having a civilization.
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:01.240]  These people are destroying civilization. That's why all over the U.S.
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:06.280]  Canadian border, there are thousands of trucks, videos on infowars.com, backed up
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:10.680]  because if you don't have the shot, you don't go across the border. And just like
[3:04:10.680 --> 3:04:14.920]  the longshoremen have walked off the coast on the west side of the country,
[3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:20.360]  it's all locked down. It's all shut down. And then when you don't get your food and
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:24.200]  your medicine, oh, it's a fault of them truckers. So don't worry in the future.
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:29.520]  After the breakdown of human society, we got robot trucks. They're safe. They'll get
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:32.520]  the goods through. And the federal government just did an emergency order
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:38.240]  to legalize teenagers driving 18-wheelers on icy roads, since the adults aren't
[3:04:38.240 --> 3:04:43.800]  stupid and won't take the shots. Humans are coming together everywhere and
[3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:48.080]  fighting. Humans understand the threat against our system. We're battling back.
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:53.200]  And we here at Infowars are the front line. You are the front line. And I salute
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:55.200]  you all.
[3:05:24.200 --> 3:05:27.200]  This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:31.120]  back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in
[3:05:31.120 --> 3:05:35.440]  America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at

[3:06:04.120 --> 3:06:10.880]  Hey everybody, Jason Bermas here. And that was the first time that I watched the
[3:06:10.880 --> 3:06:18.920]  video of those girls being segregated in schools. And it hits home. I just picked
[3:06:18.920 --> 3:06:23.680]  my niece up from school. Luckily, there is no mask mandate there. But first time
[3:06:23.680 --> 3:06:27.520]  I actually had to be in the hall and people were getting ready to go. I just
[3:06:27.520 --> 3:06:34.240]  picked her up a little bit early. And there's still 10, 20% of the people and
[3:06:34.240 --> 3:06:42.480]  the kids in masks just through this CNN syndrome. And what am I talking about?
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:47.880]  What is CNN syndrome? Well, we're gonna be talking about that. We're gonna be
[3:06:47.880 --> 3:06:52.960]  talking about another school instance where children are being taught how to
[3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:59.680]  be slaves as dogs come in randomly and sniff for COVID. All of this is not only
[3:06:59.680 --> 3:07:04.440]  promoted by CNN, but brought to you by the good people at Gavi. We're gonna show
[3:07:04.440 --> 3:07:09.880]  you all of that where they will be perpetually trained to feel like they are
[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:16.280]  grotesque. They are infected. And it is really the beginning of legitimizing the
[3:07:16.280 --> 3:07:23.120]  shielding process. And this is happening in Salem, Massachusetts. But this NASA
[3:07:23.120 --> 3:07:30.920]  document that lays it all out again, this is pre-911, July 2001, exploit CNN
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:35.080]  syndrome. What is CNN syndrome? Well, anybody can look into it. It's a little
[3:07:35.080 --> 3:07:41.000]  hard to find now that, you know, they censor everything. But it was a term used
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:46.480]  after the Gulf War had been brought to us live on CNN, really the only 24-hour
[3:07:46.480 --> 3:07:52.160]  news network at the time, when you had a limited amount of media and there was
[3:07:52.160 --> 3:07:57.000]  still kind of a news cycle going on. And look what they say under this, capture
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:08:04.400]  torture Americans in living color on prime time. We've been there on a daily
[3:08:04.400 --> 3:08:10.840]  basis, but you could take it back to just post 9-11 and look at the beheading
[3:08:10.840 --> 3:08:16.480]  videos, especially that first one with Daniel Pearl, where the man who was
[3:08:16.480 --> 3:08:24.240]  prosecuted and convicted of that, who bare minimum triple agent, is currently
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:30.640]  safe house in Britain. That guy, yeah, facilitated $100,000 to
[3:08:30.640 --> 3:08:36.200]  ATTA through General Mammoud Ahmed just before the 9-11 attacks. That guy. And
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:40.360]  then it tells you about the terror attacks coming to the continental United
[3:08:40.360 --> 3:08:47.680]  States, binary bio. What do we all just get hit with? A bio weapon. You better
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:52.960]  believe it. Critical infrastructure takedowns and serious psychological
[3:08:52.960 --> 3:09:00.240]  warfare exploiting that collateral damage. All those bodies. Think about that. As
[3:09:00.240 --> 3:09:04.720]  we watch this, and this again, this is all promoted by CNN right here. Oh, they
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:12.640]  can't look. There's not a negative word to say about this. This is Hunter. She's a
[3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:19.280]  black lab. She's 14 months old and she's a warrior in the fight against COVID.
[3:09:19.280 --> 3:09:24.280]  She's a warrior. See, she's got the little skull. She got the little punisher skull on
[3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:28.520]  there, but it's all cute. The kids love the dog. The dog loves them as they sit in
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:32.760]  a mask. Hunter received training to recognize the scent of the coronavirus.
[3:09:32.760 --> 3:09:36.960]  If she smells it, she will give a signal and then get a toy. Now, I want you to
[3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:41.920]  think about that. There's a little death skull there, you know. At the same time,
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:48.160]  all this is happening. Are we really sniffing out COVID-19 with all its
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:53.000]  variants and mutations? Or are we talking about the common cold here and its
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:59.200]  variants or the flu and its variants? How valid is this? Well, don't worry, okay,
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:05.800]  the good people at Gavi, literally a foundation created by Bill and Melinda
[3:10:05.800 --> 3:10:10.760]  Gates, okay? Of course it can. It's all promoted. They're getting you ready.
[3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:15.920]  Anybody can go, it's on their own website, scent of disease. Okay, this is coming and
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:18.840]  it's not just the schools. They like the schools because they have the captive
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:22.960]  audience and they can torture the kids and get them accustomed to this day
[3:10:22.960 --> 3:10:29.160]  after day, year after year, but they're doing it in random areas there in city
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:33.320]  halls and other establishments as well. Nothing found in this second grade gym
[3:10:33.320 --> 3:10:38.880]  class at the LG Norris Elementary School in Norton, Massachusetts. So she goes on
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:42.800]  to play with some of the children, but then Hunter is brought into the school
[3:10:42.800 --> 3:10:47.360]  library. Good girl. And while first graders have music class in the other
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:52.520]  side of the library, Hunter abruptly sits down, a signal bat. We do have some
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:59.400]  photo, presence of COVID-19 on this bookshelf. She just, she actually just sat.
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:04.280]  See, and it's so dangerous that he like goes over to where the COVID-19 is
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:09.800]  unprotected and touches it while his mask is under his nose. All of this theater,
[3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:14.760]  this is psychosis, this is Stockholm syndrome on a mass level, it gets worse
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:19.960]  to what they're going to do now because you're not sick. You haven't tested
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:25.560]  positive for anything. You might have been in that area. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Good girl.
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:29.320]  So what I'll do is I'll praise her. Good girl. Let her wait it out a little bit,
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:33.800]  kind of dial it in, try to, try to narrow it down. We know COVID-19 primarily
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:38.600]  spreads through the air and Hunter is searching there too. An odor is almost
[3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:42.280]  like a cone. If you could picture a cone, the source of the odor is strong at the
[3:11:42.280 --> 3:11:47.880]  base like it was on the bookshelf. And then the odor goes out into a corn.
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:52.040]  This is Duke. He's Hunter's partner in the Canaan COVID Patrol.
[3:11:52.040 --> 3:11:58.280]  This is the school cafeteria. He stops abruptly and sits too.
[3:11:58.280 --> 3:12:01.880]  He just found something. And then two minutes later,
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:06.760]  what did he find here? Same thing. So what happens after Duke and Hunter make
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:10.440]  their discoveries? We notify parents in terms of if we have
[3:12:10.440 --> 3:12:14.680]  information that a student is specific in that seat, we want parents to have that
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:18.120]  right to make a decision about do they want to test and state the student, do
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:21.320]  they want to pull the student, or just keep an eye out for symptoms.
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:27.160]  Let's just stop right there. Again, your child has tested positive for
[3:12:27.160 --> 3:12:32.600]  nothing, for nothing at all. Okay. And at first they're going to make it cute
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:36.920]  about a decision, but soon it won't be a decision. That's in the CDC
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:41.560]  documents that if you've simply been exposed to somebody, right, and that's
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:45.880]  why the Supreme Court ruling is atrocious and disgusting,
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:48.440]  right? Because we have to protect all these people. We won't give them the
[3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:52.280]  actual treatments that work, that we know work, that Dana White
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:56.680]  went off on about this week and props to Dana White for doing that.
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:12:59.800]  You know, we won't talk about the monoclonal antibodies. We won't talk
[3:12:59.800 --> 3:13:03.960]  about inhaled de-designite. We won't talk about ivermectin.
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:07.320]  No, no, no, no, no. And we won't talk about them early for sure,
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:11.720]  but shots that they've continually lied to us about, and that will be coming up
[3:13:11.720 --> 3:13:15.480]  in the next segment, the progression of the Pfizer lie.
[3:13:15.480 --> 3:13:20.040]  You're going to see it from March of last year, okay,
[3:13:20.040 --> 3:13:24.360]  all the way to this coming March where they're promising their fourth shot,
[3:13:24.360 --> 3:13:28.840]  already promising it, okay? And it doesn't matter how many of these shots you
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:32.040]  take, all this is going on. In fact, they're going to tell you that.
[3:13:32.040 --> 3:13:35.240]  They're like, whoa, and you know, the CNN guy is going to make sure, what if
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:39.080]  people don't want to wear masks because we have the COVID dogs?
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:43.000]  What if they don't want to take shots if we have the COVID dogs? Oh, don't worry.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:47.080]  This is just another part of the authoritarian takeover and getting you
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:51.240]  used to being a slave, especially your children.
[3:13:51.240 --> 3:13:55.560]  In addition, after the detector dog makes a hit,
[3:13:55.560 --> 3:14:00.600]  the areas are disinfected. Did that remind you of those China videos?
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:04.520]  See, you're bad, you're disgusting, you're infected.
[3:14:04.520 --> 3:14:07.400]  Don't worry, we can fix it through transhumanism.
[3:14:07.400 --> 3:14:11.560]  That's all coming too. The now regular visits of these dogs to Bristol
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:14.920]  County Schools, police stations, city halls, and other locations
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:18.760]  is a result of research done at Florida International University.
[3:14:18.760 --> 3:14:22.520]  Kenneth Fertin is the provost there and a scholar in forensic chemistry.
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:25.560]  And you know, I'm just going to skip over that nightmare of a human being that
[3:14:25.560 --> 3:14:29.560]  just promotes this on behalf of Big Pharma, okay? And bring you to this gentleman
[3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:33.560]  because here's the big concern again. What happens if they don't want to take
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:37.720]  the shots because of this? You know, those shots that are so safe and effective.
[3:14:37.720 --> 3:14:41.720]  Are you concerned that parents here and other people here will say,
[3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:45.240]  ah, we don't need to mask up all the time. We don't need vaccines. We don't need a
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:49.960]  test. We have the dogs. This is not to replace what CDC and
[3:14:49.960 --> 3:14:53.240]  DPH are telling people in the communities about
[3:14:53.240 --> 3:14:57.160]  what to do. That's a whole part of the science and what they believe is a
[3:14:57.160 --> 3:15:00.520]  preventative measure. So this is a way for us to
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:04.040]  enhance that in a very direct way and be proactive
[3:15:04.040 --> 3:15:06.920]  to prevent more people from getting sick, but they should continue to do
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:10.360]  what CDC is recommending. See, we're just going to enhance everything.
[3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:13.800]  That's what we're going to do. We're going to enhance it. That is the CNN
[3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:19.640]  syndrome we just talked about. That is exploiting this 24-hour media cycle
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:25.560]  that has obviously gone well beyond what it used to be in the 90s
[3:15:25.560 --> 3:15:31.320]  and even what it grew into via 9-11. Because that's when it really exploded.
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:35.080]  That's when they took TV off the air for weeks,
[3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:40.840]  for weeks and just played 24-hour news. This is psychological warfare.
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:45.080]  It's real. Info Wars has been fighting the battle for a very long time.
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:49.080]  Go give a donation over to saveinfowars.com
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:56.200]  right now and support Alex Jones and this operation.
[3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:23.880]  in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[3:16:23.880 --> 3:16:26.920]  we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:30.840]  unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:33.960]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:37.240]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:16:37.240 --> 3:16:41.240]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience
[3:16:41.240 --> 3:16:45.640]  are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:49.560]  storable foods, water filtration, survival gear,
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:53.480]  seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge
[3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:57.560]  at infowarstore.com. Well here we are in the year
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:17:01.240]  2022 and Info Wars is now more important than it's
[3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:05.000]  ever been. We are truly in the zeitgeist. I want to thank you all for keeping us on
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:08.360]  the air and I want to encourage you to take advantage of a true
[3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:11.320]  win-win situation or a 360 win as I've called it

[3:17:51.320 --> 3:17:55.400]  and Brain Force Plus is back in stock as well at 40% off.
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:17:59.320]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years
[3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:03.400]  against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:06.920]  world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:09.960]  operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:13.880]  awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:17.560]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[3:18:17.560 --> 3:18:21.480]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and
[3:18:21.480 --> 3:18:24.440]  all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[3:18:24.440 --> 3:18:27.400]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:30.600]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:18:30.600 --> 3:18:33.640]  but we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:36.440]  things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food,
[3:18:36.440 --> 3:18:40.280]  ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:40.280 --> 3:18:44.040]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets,
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:48.600]  it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:52.520]  and before there are long lines and waits. Because believe me, serious times
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:57.640]  are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:57.640 --> 3:19:01.240]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean this is from, people say,
[3:19:01.240 --> 3:19:05.400]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communist? Well, that's where some of the
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:08.200]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:11.800]  above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:14.920]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:17.720]  communists, but really they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is
[3:19:17.720 --> 3:19:20.920]  that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:23.160]  government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican
[3:19:23.160 --> 3:19:26.200]  rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:29.960]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for
[3:19:29.960 --> 3:19:32.600]  pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:36.120]  anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels,
[3:19:36.120 --> 3:19:40.200]  literally. Um, in fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:44.600]  Um, we had like that. I think you wouldn't believe it.
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:49.400]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if
[3:19:49.400 --> 3:19:53.000]  you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:20:20.360]  We are back. I'm Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones in the fourth hour. And now we're
[3:20:20.360 --> 3:20:27.880]  going to move into how this big lie works and evolved and how Alex and I discussed
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:34.360]  exactly why they chose a coronavirus because they knew it was a problem that
[3:20:34.360 --> 3:20:41.160]  could never, ever be fixed. And back in December of last year,
[3:20:41.160 --> 3:20:46.040]  not just a couple months ago, obviously, we had a discussion about this and we
[3:20:46.040 --> 3:20:49.880]  highlighted the fact that they know the mutations are going to be there.
[3:20:49.880 --> 3:20:54.680]  They've already told us it would be a minimum of three to five shots and people
[3:20:54.680 --> 3:21:01.000]  like Bill Gates, what they boasted, then it would be at least a bi annual thing.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:07.080]  And we're seeing more and more of that come into fruition. So let's talk about how the lie works.
[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:13.720]  Now MSNBC, I would argue, is an extension of that CNN syndrome, especially when you have somebody
[3:21:13.720 --> 3:21:21.240]  like Mika Brzezinski, the daughter of the man behind the grand chess board itself,
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:29.800]  the acolyte of Rockefeller and globalism. Basically, I mean, if you don't understand
[3:21:29.800 --> 3:21:34.200]  how some of these things came into being, for instance, the trilateral commission
[3:21:34.920 --> 3:21:42.200]  was formed by Brzezinski on a plane with David Rockefeller. It's in their own documents.
[3:21:42.200 --> 3:21:45.320]  Anybody can go look this up. We could type it in right now if you'd like.
[3:21:45.960 --> 3:21:53.240]  All right. And basically, Rockefeller was upset that the Bilderberg group was not being receptive
[3:21:53.240 --> 3:22:00.040]  to Japanese and Asian interests. And he wanted to bring them in another way. And that's essentially
[3:22:00.040 --> 3:22:06.760]  how the trilateral commission began to be formed through Brzezinski. Well, his daughter, Mika,
[3:22:06.760 --> 3:22:13.480]  has held that family legacy of being a mouthpiece for establishment propaganda
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:16.920]  at the behest of globalism. And what we're about to watch right now,
[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:24.840]  all right, I want everybody to see this where it's from. This is March of last year of 2021.
[3:22:24.840 --> 3:22:30.200]  And this is Mr. Pfizer. And he kind of tells you that they're going to get you to do this
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:34.040]  through human engineering, literally comes out of his mouth, because they can't help
[3:22:34.040 --> 3:22:40.520]  but tell the truth as they lie to you to tell you what the real plan is happening. And even
[3:22:40.520 --> 3:22:45.800]  Mika will bring up, oh, we know there are going to be mutations and variants. And don't worry,
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:53.080]  he assures you these things are very safe and very effective. And they use a language that is very
[3:22:53.080 --> 3:22:59.320]  Bernaysian indeed. Just out this morning from Pfizer is a report that confirms the vaccine's
[3:22:59.320 --> 3:23:06.360]  effectiveness in fighting the coronavirus. Joining us now is the chairman and CEO of
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:14.440]  Pfizer, Albert Borla. Albert, it is great to see you as always. And congratulations.
[3:23:15.400 --> 3:23:19.720]  This is up there as one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time. So I
[3:23:19.720 --> 3:23:27.240]  guess the first question is, how did you do it? One of the greatest scientific achievements
[3:23:27.240 --> 3:23:35.560]  of all time. And in this, he's already going to tell you one of the truths that the mechanisms
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:42.520]  were already in place. mRNA, quote unquote, drugs or therapeutics have been around for decades,
[3:23:42.520 --> 3:23:48.040]  and they were defense department developed. Of course, he's not going to volunteer that part
[3:23:48.040 --> 3:23:58.120]  of the story. I don't think I did it. I think it was a whole group of brilliant scientists
[3:23:58.120 --> 3:24:04.600]  that did it. But there were some lessons learned of how we all were able to do it. And I think
[3:24:04.600 --> 3:24:11.000]  the first one, it is that luck never comes to the unprepared. I felt their organization was
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:19.160]  preparing to stand to rise to the occasion or something like that. The second is that thinking
[3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:25.960]  big can make the impossible possible. Many times we were in front of this cannot be done. And many
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:31.080]  times we said it must be done. And the third and actually more important than everything, I think,
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:39.720]  the lesson learned is the power of the science. And I would say also the power of human ingenuity,
[3:24:39.720 --> 3:24:43.080]  particularly when you liberate them, it is happening private sector setting.
[3:24:43.960 --> 3:24:52.680]  So take human engineering in the private sector setting. Think about that, human engineering.
[3:24:53.240 --> 3:24:57.000]  In other words, getting people prepared that they're going to have to take this,
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:04.040]  that there are going to be mandates, that they're safe and effective. Everything you saw
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:12.680]  preparing in Event 201 for that hybrid techno-fascism that also included what? Censorship.
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:16.040]  This guy was always talking about the dangerous conspiracy theories too.
[3:25:16.920 --> 3:25:21.400]  So I'm very happy that we were able to do it.
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:29.880]  So now I have to ask, what are some of the hurdles that you foresee ahead? Because I guess part of
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:36.760]  being able to make a vaccine successful is to make sure it gets to everybody who needs it
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:43.880]  before different strains of the coronavirus take over or different parts of the world don't have it.
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:51.080]  What do you see as the hurdles ahead in terms of getting the world in order as it pertains to
[3:25:51.080 --> 3:25:56.680]  the coronavirus? And what are some of the concerns you might have about these second,
[3:25:56.680 --> 3:26:03.320]  third and fourth strains of the coronavirus? I just want to point this out. She totally mentions
[3:26:03.320 --> 3:26:07.080]  there are other strains. And guys, there were strains after strains and mutations all over the
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:14.840]  place, all over the place. It's a coronavirus. It's going to constantly mutate. Again, the framing
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:21.720]  of all this is setting you up for the multitude of never-ending authoritarian shots are going to be
[3:26:21.720 --> 3:26:27.240]  taken. It's a great question. I would say that the first hurdle and most important was to be able
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:32.360]  to discover and develop a vaccine and that we are ready there. The second hurdle was to be able
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:39.560]  to scale up manufacturing so that everybody can receive it in the world as quickly as possible.
[3:26:39.560 --> 3:26:44.840]  And to that I think we did pretty well. The amounts that we are manufacturing right now
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:49.720]  are going up and up. So I believe pretty soon that will not be any obstacle anymore.
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:54.680]  And as President Biden said, for example, in the US, I may likely there will be enough
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:26:59.480]  dose manufacturing to vaccinate everybody. So that will not be the issue. I think then it is
[3:26:59.480 --> 3:27:07.560]  the issue of the machine that is vaccinating the people. That has to do with great decrodenation
[3:27:07.560 --> 3:27:13.320]  between the state and the local government and with the measures that can improve these
[3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:19.320]  capabilities. And again, I believe that in the recent month or so, there has been such an incredible
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:24.120]  improvement. All the indexes and the metrics are indicating that we are doing a great job on that.
[3:27:24.120 --> 3:27:28.440]  So also that will not be an issue, I think, pretty soon. And then I think the remaining
[3:27:28.440 --> 3:27:33.000]  will be that I still believe that there will be some of our citizens that will be skeptical about
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:42.360]  the vaccine. So I would try to focus on them right now, try to explain them the safety and the
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:47.800]  efficacy of the vaccine, try to explain them the consequences of not getting a vaccine shot
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:54.760]  for them and unfortunately for humanity. So again, they invert reality. The consequences
[3:27:54.760 --> 3:28:01.560]  for humanity if you don't take the shot. Think about that. All of it. And they knew right out
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:05.000]  of the gates that we're going to be people fighting back against this. So again, remember,
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  this is March of last year, when we come back on the other side, here's where they start to admit
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:21.240]  things. Oh, oh, it starts to drop after six months to 84%. Guys, this is in July. Okay,
[3:28:21.240 --> 3:28:27.160]  this is in July, six months ago. All right, we're still another week and a half out from when he
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:36.200]  said this. What did he say only two weeks ago? Oh, very limited protection, if at all, not 84%,
[3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:40.360]  but we're going to get into all of it on the other side. I am Jason Burmist sitting in for
[3:28:40.360 --> 3:28:47.480]  Alex Jones in the fourth hour. Remember to go to info wars store.com, get yourself a copy of COVID
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:53.320]  land two. And if you haven't seen one, get yourself a copy of that as well. Hold screenings, show
[3:28:53.320 --> 3:28:59.480]  people the information they need. Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very
[3:28:59.480 --> 3:29:04.920]  popular products are back in stock. Whole food, multivitamin, essential nutrient multivitamin
[3:29:04.920 --> 3:29:11.240]  from natural healthy sources, not synthetic and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, the classic
[3:29:11.240 --> 3:29:15.800]  Linus Pauling Nobel Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:22.600]  in your body. They're both back in stock sold out for more than four months at 40% off. Another
[3:29:22.600 --> 3:29:28.600]  reason I'm very, very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep us on air. So again,
[3:29:28.600 --> 3:29:36.280]  it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin and take
[3:29:36.280 --> 3:29:40.600]  vitamin C and take zinc. And we also have some great vitamin D products in info wars store.com
[3:29:40.600 --> 3:29:46.360]  as well. But whatever you do, defend your body's immune system. We want to keep patriots in the
[3:29:46.360 --> 3:29:50.360]  game against the new world order. So it's a 360 win. It's something essential for your body and
[3:29:50.360 --> 3:29:54.600]  your health and your longevity and your immune system while funding the info war at info wars
[3:29:54.600 --> 3:30:00.040]  store.com. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello,
[3:30:00.040 --> 3:30:04.520]  Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can
[3:30:04.520 --> 3:30:09.880]  get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your cohost Owen shroyer,
[3:30:09.880 --> 3:30:15.720]  super male vitality and brain force plus mixed those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:30:15.720 --> 3:30:20.920]  Super male vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that
[3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:27.400]  have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions. It also
[3:30:27.400 --> 3:30:31.960]  worked quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. It's it's it's
[3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:36.040]  like each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are
[3:30:36.040 --> 3:30:39.480]  like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong. That's just how
[3:30:39.480 --> 3:30:45.400]  it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But
[3:30:45.400 --> 3:30:53.080]  yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:30:55.560 --> 3:31:03.480]  In late August, info or solid explosion of orders, because our audience understands that the globalist
[3:31:03.480 --> 3:31:09.880]  are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial
[3:31:09.880 --> 3:31:14.600]  collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's
[3:31:14.600 --> 3:31:18.840]  important to have. It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with
[3:31:18.840 --> 3:31:24.680]  water filtration, self defense and a relationship with God. But now more than ever, you need to
[3:31:24.680 --> 3:31:29.560]  get your storeable food orders in now. We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[3:31:29.560 --> 3:31:35.000]  It's high quality. It's very, very low cost at info or store.com. Because in the future,
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:39.640]  you're going to see more food supply shortages, and you're going to see food supply price increases
[3:31:39.640 --> 3:31:44.440]  that are already taking place. So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the
[3:31:44.440 --> 3:31:50.840]  info or at info or store.com. That's how you fight the great reset is by being self sufficient and
[3:31:50.840 --> 3:31:57.400]  not under their control. So get prepared now at info or store.com. Well, here we are in the year
[3:31:57.400 --> 3:32:03.400]  2022. And info wars is now more important than it's ever been. We are truly in the zeitgeist.
[3:32:03.400 --> 3:32:07.320]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air. And I want to encourage you to take advantage of
[3:32:07.320 --> 3:32:13.480]  a true win win situation or a 360 win as I've called it at info or store.com. Get high quality
[3:32:13.480 --> 3:32:18.600]  supplements that make your body healthier, make you happier and then defend your body with your
[3:32:18.600 --> 3:32:23.400]  immune system against outside attackers. Ladies and gentlemen, multivitamins are the way to go.
[3:32:23.400 --> 3:32:29.000]  But so many of them are synthetic. Our multivitamin whole food system is one of the best quality
[3:32:29.000 --> 3:32:32.200]  multivitamin systems you're going to find. But regardless of whether you get it from us or
[3:32:32.200 --> 3:32:37.480]  somebody else research, it's a whole food multivitamin and get it for you and your family,
[3:32:37.480 --> 3:32:42.600]  especially old folks, children, everybody needs it, but especially old folks. Also,
[3:32:42.600 --> 3:32:49.400]  we have vitamin C and zinc with rose hips. It's also back in stock. It's at 40% off. Both these
[3:32:49.400 --> 3:32:54.600]  are available at info or short.com and brain force plus is back in stock as well at 40% off.
[3:32:56.760 --> 3:33:02.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:02.760 --> 3:33:19.000]  And we are back. I'm Jason Burma sitting in the fourth hour. You just saw the CEO of Pfizer telling
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:27.160]  you you were costing humanity and had consequences for them because you wouldn't take their shots
[3:33:27.160 --> 3:33:37.400]  of hate and lies. So we move from MSNBC into July. Okay. Remember that was March of 2021 into July
[3:33:37.960 --> 3:33:42.520]  where now they have headlines like this. I just want to read this before we actually
[3:33:43.480 --> 3:33:51.560]  go over the video because it's ridiculous, man. It's ridiculous. The efficacy of Pfizer's coronavirus
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:58.360]  vaccine steadily declines to about 84% after six months. And efficacy of what? They told you it
[3:33:58.360 --> 3:34:03.560]  was going to keep you out of the hospital. It was going to keep you from getting very ill in a virus
[3:34:03.560 --> 3:34:09.800]  that didn't do that to 99% of the people that got it anyway. You were testing against 1%. They cooked
[3:34:09.800 --> 3:34:15.800]  the numbers every single way they could. Remember fully vaccinated wasn't until at least 15 days
[3:34:15.800 --> 3:34:23.560]  after your second shot or your one shot of J&J. But we're talking Pfizer here. Okay. The vaccine's
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:32.280]  initial studies showed it protected people 100% of the time. Imagination land against hospitalization.
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:38.680]  Total lies from the very get-goes. But that falls now to 90s to the mid 80s after six months. So
[3:34:38.680 --> 3:34:47.720]  again, watch how this is framed. Watch her literally feign over this guy and the lies to get you ready
[3:34:47.720 --> 3:34:52.600]  and prepared for the boosty. Don't worry, we're going to have a boosty for you.
[3:34:54.360 --> 3:34:59.320]  You know, Chairman Albert Borla to talk about all of this and more. Albert, thanks for being with us.
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:07.160]  I want to start with some of the data you mentioned on the call about seeing the immunity
[3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:13.880]  wane after six months with the COVID vaccine. I think you mentioned that it not only wanes against
[3:35:13.880 --> 3:35:18.600]  disease in general, but also against severe disease. So once you start to get six to eight
[3:35:18.600 --> 3:35:25.240]  months out, the protection against hospitalization starts to go down into the 90%, even the 80%
[3:35:25.240 --> 3:35:31.720]  range. You see how they soften the blow just now? It goes down just like 16%. And then again,
[3:35:31.720 --> 3:35:37.720]  six months after this, he'll basically says it may not offer any protection at all.
[3:35:38.280 --> 3:35:42.440]  Is that what you're seeing? And is that the basis for your conversations with the U.S.
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:45.160]  government and others about a need for a booster?
[3:35:46.840 --> 3:35:52.040]  Thank you. No, the basis is this data plus many other endpoints, because these are important
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:56.200]  decisions that all the regulatory and health authorities of the world, they want to have
[3:35:56.200 --> 3:36:02.920]  holistic view. There is a waning of the efficacy, as we just printed today,
[3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:09.240]  the data from our main study that was from the original virus of the Delta variant.
[3:36:09.240 --> 3:36:14.840]  And it was the first two months was 97%. The second two months was 90% approximately. And the
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:24.280]  four to six months was approximately 84%. We have seen also data from Israel,
[3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:31.240]  but there is a waning of immunity. And that starts impacting what used to be 100% against
[3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:41.000]  hospitalization. Now in the six months period, he's becoming low 90s, mid to high 80s.
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:48.520]  Total lies. I mean, beyond lies right there. But you see how they soften the blow for you?
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:53.560]  And then they say, oh, so that means like seven, eight months, maybe it'll be down to 70,
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:37:00.200]  80%. No, we're six months later. He's introducing the idea of new variants. Oh,
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:05.240]  Delta's here. Omicron's not here yet. And in the same instance, he's going to get you ready for
[3:37:05.240 --> 3:37:14.040]  that initial boosty. But the good news is that we are very, very confident that a third dose,
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:23.720]  a booster will take up the immune response to levels that will be enough to protect against
[3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:31.640]  the Delta variant. I mean, look at these numbers. They're promising you five times antibodies against
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:37.560]  Delta. All right, then the second dose and 11 times boost in antibodies and older people.
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:45.640]  He's allowed to put this up and not go to prison. Okay, because it's just we believe or they could
[3:37:45.640 --> 3:37:53.080]  or this study shows and the science evolves. And here comes the boost. Don't worry. Here she is.
[3:37:53.080 --> 3:37:59.400]  And now we're going to move on to just a couple weeks ago. Again, less than six months. Remember,
[3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:06.120]  they promised us six months was going on to 84%. No, it's a 0%. And we know that
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:10.680]  the three, the two dose of the vaccine offer very limited protection if any,
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:15.800]  limited protection if any, can we go back one? Let me hear that again. So now two shots is just
[3:38:15.800 --> 3:38:23.720]  limited. It's not 84%. Wow. And we know that the three, the two dose of the vaccine offer very
[3:38:23.720 --> 3:38:30.360]  limited protection if any, the three doses with the booster, they offer reasonable protection
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:34.360]  against hospitalization and deaths. So again, now we're not even giving numbers.
[3:38:34.360 --> 3:38:42.040]  Reasonable protection against hospitalization and death. That's the new evolving science. It gets
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:47.240]  worse. You know, again, he's priming you for a fourth shot. They're telling you is coming this
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:58.440]  March. It gets very good. And less protection against the infection. Now, we are working
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:04.840]  on a new version for our vaccine, the 1.1. Let me put it that way. But we'll cover all
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:13.320]  the time as well. And of course, we are waiting to have the final results. The vaccine will be
[3:39:13.320 --> 3:39:21.960]  ready in March. So the 1.1 signed the 2.0. The fourth shot you're going to take in this country
[3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:30.680]  isn't the 2.0. It's the 1.1. What does that tell you? Well, it should alarm you. You should be
[3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:36.840]  thinking to yourself, that doesn't seem normal. These are forever shots that these slavery passes
[3:39:36.840 --> 3:39:42.760]  that they are associating with them are no longer saying that fully vaccinated is just two shots.
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:48.120]  They're getting ready for a booster and a booster and a booster and anything they want to put on
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:54.760]  that thing. If you acquiesce to QR codes and slave passes, it might be over for you. You might want
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:40:00.040]  to fight back. If you're allowing your children to wear masks and be tortured all the time while
[3:40:00.040 --> 3:40:04.920]  dogs are coming in to sniff for COVID and you're not outraged, you're not pulling them from the
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:09.320]  schools, you're not trying to get on national television, you're not going to your local
[3:40:09.320 --> 3:40:13.240]  meetings and saying, look, guys, we need to stop this right now. What are you doing?
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:19.880]  What are you doing? So here's the hospitalizations in Alabama because everything was so safe and
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:26.920]  effective. This is from this week. Now in East Alabama, an anomaly at Aniston's Regional Medical
[3:40:26.920 --> 3:40:33.880]  Center. Not an anomaly. There are more COVID-19 inpatients who are vaccinated than those who
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:40.360]  are unvaccinated. ABC 3340's Aaron Wise had some questions of health officers. So Aaron, explain
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:49.720]  to us what's going on. They always have to explain. Well, Pam, numbers don't lie, but they do have to
[3:40:49.720 --> 3:40:56.040]  be interpreted correctly here. Everything has to be interpreted now. Okay. And by the way,
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:59.880]  the interpretation isn't a good one. Wait until you tell you the numbers.
[3:40:59.880 --> 3:41:07.080]  Armsy and Aniston, they do have 15 vaccinated patients and two partially vaccinated patients
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:13.720]  with 14 unvaccinated patients. A nurse here at RMC tells me that of those vaccinated,
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:19.000]  only a few are boosted. And the ones that are boosted have underlying health conditions,
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:26.360]  such as diabetes, obesity, or our immunocompromised. So I want to just say this again. All right,
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:31.240]  15 people in there, a few, they don't even want to give you the numbers. So that's three or more
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:39.160]  have taken three of these shots that are supposed to remember this guy told you in July in older
[3:41:39.160 --> 3:41:50.360]  people, it was going to boost anybody's 11 times. And you got, you got the majority in the hospital,
[3:41:50.360 --> 3:41:56.600]  the majority that's 15 and you don't even count the two partial. That's more than the 14. Okay.
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:42:03.960]  So it doesn't do anything. Can you prove any efficacy? I mean, I don't think you can. I
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:08.520]  think you can prove that these people are liars. So let's, let's wrap it up when they're trying
[3:42:08.520 --> 3:42:13.640]  to explain how this has happened. The Alabama Department of Public Health says vaccines work.
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:20.760]  Statewide numbers show 64% of those in hospitals right now are unvaccinated. So statewide,
[3:42:20.760 --> 3:42:28.120]  they're still admitting to 36% taking these shots. But don't worry, the expert's going to come on
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:34.680]  and tell you everything is a okay. I'm not going to puke in my mouth and listen to that trash.
[3:42:35.400 --> 3:42:39.160]  In fact, when we come back, we're going to show you a story of hope. We're going to show you
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:46.280]  medical professionals standing up and speaking out against this techno fascist takeover,
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:53.320]  this great reset agenda. We must all become the great resistance to go to info wars.com
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:59.640]  right now and make that donation. Whether they were present that day or were otherwise
[3:42:59.640 --> 3:43:06.200]  criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever
[3:43:06.200 --> 3:43:13.000]  they lead domestic terrorists. The days of independent media are numbered. The government
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:19.400]  has made it illegal to oppose them. They are now debaking us behind the scenes. They want to bankrupt
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:26.200]  us and make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:31.640]  up in camps. The traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the
[3:43:31.640 --> 3:43:38.920]  awakening exponentially. So be it. Make them silence us by force. This is the final battle
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:47.320]  of the information war. Give now, buy products, donate before everything changes. We need you
[3:43:47.320 --> 3:43:54.840]  to carry us through to the end. Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:44:08.520]  William, California. People are asleep and program controlled. I agree. How do you make
[3:44:08.520 --> 3:44:12.920]  the sleeper awaken William? Oh, hi, Alice. Thanks for taking my call. Can I plug, uh,
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:19.480]  Alex real quick? Yeah, go ahead. Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:23.640]  and I worked them into the ground and you wanted to why and I've tested this and I've taken your
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:30.760]  B12 and let me tell you when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do. I take that B12 and I'm
[3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:36.200]  electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work, uh, with a highway department
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:42.520]  and my friends will attest to the fact that yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70,
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:55.960]  I'm, and I'm no, I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life. Well, here we are in the
[3:44:55.960 --> 3:45:02.600]  year 2022 and info wars is now more important than it's ever been. We are truly in the zeitgeist.
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:06.440]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air and I want to encourage you to take advantage

[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:11.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:22.760]  Final segment of the fourth hour. I am Jason Bermas. This is the Alex Jones show. I want to thank
[3:47:22.760 --> 3:47:28.840]  the info wars crew and Alex Jones for giving me this opportunity every so often to come to
[3:47:28.840 --> 3:47:33.240]  you people and show you some stories that maybe you haven't seen in the mainstream and haven't
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:40.440]  been focused on enough. That's why we talk about signature reduction, the secret military program
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:47.480]  that violates posi commentatus and has already been mobilized via this war on terror for over a
[3:47:47.480 --> 3:47:55.400]  decade against the American people. The fusion centers were there. The camps were built. The
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:48:02.680]  drills have been and continue to be run. These are important issues and the issues that are so
[3:48:02.680 --> 3:48:08.680]  important continue to be censored by big tech. So if you do want to see more of my stuff before
[3:48:08.680 --> 3:48:14.360]  we get to this video of very, very brave healthcare workers and nurses that need to
[3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:19.640]  start standing up even more in my opinion, not just these women, but everybody around the country,
[3:48:19.640 --> 3:48:24.920]  go check out Rockfin. We know there's going to be a big turnout over in DC on Sunday. People
[3:48:24.920 --> 3:48:29.560]  like McCullough and Malone will be speaking out against the mandates there. And if you want to
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:35.400]  be a part of the program right now, you can go over to my Twitter and at the top pinned post,
[3:48:35.400 --> 3:48:39.560]  you can actually leave a video question. Let's keep it under 30 seconds or so,
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:46.600]  where you can have me comment on an article or a news story or get a different opinion in there
[3:48:46.600 --> 3:48:52.440]  and be part of the show. So you go over to Twitter, you go figure that out. It's a way to interact
[3:48:52.440 --> 3:49:00.200]  and become part of the info warrior program. Let's get to it. This woman is spot on right here.
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:07.160]  And then of all the people that have recently been admitted with COVID, how many of those people
[3:49:07.160 --> 3:49:13.480]  are fully vaccinated? How many of your fully vaccinated employees are having breakthrough
[3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:21.160]  cases? And out of 2,807 patients have died in your hospitals. How many of them were refused
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:30.840]  early treatment? Yes, financially, we have a lot of questions. In 2019, Methodist Hospital reported
[3:49:30.840 --> 3:49:39.320]  over $4 billion in assets. This was before COVID. Let's see what they've done since COVID. How much
[3:49:39.320 --> 3:49:47.560]  have your executives profited from the COVID windfall? Do you have any financial relationships
[3:49:47.560 --> 3:49:54.200]  with the vaccine companies? How much are you making from the vaccines? How much have you been
[3:49:54.200 --> 3:49:59.960]  rewarded by giving remdesivir? And what have your complications been from giving remdesivir?
[3:50:03.480 --> 3:50:10.760]  Because I have not responded to my request for information, I decided to take legal action
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:26.600]  against Methodist. I want to make this clear. I'm not seeking any financial gains from this
[3:50:26.600 --> 3:50:32.760]  or personal gain. I am simply seeking the truth, which we all deserve. All of us,
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:40.120]  all of us, and we need more people like her to step up. And unfortunately, we have to wage
[3:50:40.120 --> 3:50:46.280]  lawfare against these people. We have to shine the light of their dark ties. We have to let people
[3:50:46.280 --> 3:50:54.840]  know that it's Gavi that's pushing slavery on your children via random COVID checks by a dog.
[3:50:55.880 --> 3:51:01.320]  You're always guilty. You're always dirty. You could be part of that shielding process
[3:51:01.320 --> 3:51:09.240]  where we put you into a nice little facility like Djokovic got. And that's reality right now.
[3:51:09.240 --> 3:51:16.920]  And that's why I continue to point out that this collaboration has been going on a long time.
[3:51:16.920 --> 3:51:23.400]  This is Moderna's own website. With advancing mRNA research, you are taking
[3:51:23.400 --> 3:51:30.360]  literal Defense Department technology, a Defense Department that never told you the truth about
[3:51:30.360 --> 3:51:37.800]  9-11, that never told you the truth about the war in Iraq, that continues to lie to you about what's
[3:51:37.800 --> 3:51:44.440]  going on in Yemen, a Defense Department that wants freedom of speech brought to its knees
[3:51:44.440 --> 3:51:51.720]  by making an example out of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, one that has enabled a
[3:51:51.720 --> 3:51:58.920]  department of Deutschland security. Homeland security has always been a disgrace in this
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:06.760]  country, a complete and total disgrace to be mobilized against soccer moms who don't want
[3:52:06.760 --> 3:52:14.120]  their kids tortured and indoctrinated. We're here. We're here. You got Merrick Garland up there
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:21.320]  talking about how he's going to go after everybody he wants that was at the Capitol
[3:52:21.320 --> 3:52:29.400]  or criminally culpable otherwise. What does that mean? We are the enemy. We have been the enemy.
[3:52:29.400 --> 3:52:37.880]  And that is why I continue and have to continue to highlight that they are actively, actively,
[3:52:37.880 --> 3:52:45.400]  actively committing treason against the American populace openly through their military industrial
[3:52:45.400 --> 3:52:51.800]  complex, through their secret undercover army of signature reduction right here, through their
[3:52:51.800 --> 3:53:01.480]  Trojan horse civilian systems with partnerships from Google to NASA where they achieve quantum
[3:53:01.480 --> 3:53:11.880]  supremacy in AI. And they're able to classify and inventory technology for 40 plus years.
[3:53:11.880 --> 3:53:19.400]  You think I'm kidding? Again, the document that keeps on given inputs in new procurement decisions.
[3:53:19.400 --> 3:53:28.360]  They take about 15 years to produce. We'll keep them in inventory for 40 plus. That's the reality.
[3:53:28.360 --> 3:53:36.840]  That's how they knew in this document that the bio nano era was going to begin when in 2020 and
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:41.240]  they want you in that metaverse, that virtual universe, but they don't know when and they're
[3:53:41.240 --> 3:53:47.560]  not sure how once it gets to this tipping point when their transhumanist teeth begin to shell.
[3:53:47.560 --> 3:53:55.000]  That's the reality. Okay. So we have to go back to our instincts as human beings and realize
[3:53:55.800 --> 3:54:02.760]  that these people are people. They can be exposed. They can be punished for their crimes. Their
[3:54:02.760 --> 3:54:10.680]  agendas can be stopped. You can be a human being. You can raise other human beings. You can reach
[3:54:10.680 --> 3:54:20.200]  out to liberals and conservatives and Republicans and Democrats to people in China and South America
[3:54:20.200 --> 3:54:26.680]  and Canada and Australia and all across the world and say, this is the battle for humanity.
[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:35.720]  And they've put it on paper. This is a reality. We have to come together against and in my final
[3:54:35.720 --> 3:54:43.640]  minutes here, I am appalled to see what has happened in this country and what continues
[3:54:43.640 --> 3:54:49.960]  to happen and how life saving medication has not only been restricted from people,
[3:54:51.240 --> 3:55:00.360]  but literal death, death has been injected to some. And at the very least, it is defense
[3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:06.040]  department technology that worked with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that worked with
[3:55:06.040 --> 3:55:14.520]  AstraZeneca and worked with DARPA over almost a decade ago. And you have those DARPA leaks
[3:55:15.400 --> 3:55:21.240]  from Project Veritas. The mainstream media doesn't want to touch. And even when they might have a
[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:27.160]  win or a glimpse into it, they don't want to get into the fact that, hey, it wasn't just China.
[3:55:27.160 --> 3:55:33.400]  It says other labs in the United States. Hey, they were doing this. Hey, they also knew that
[3:55:33.400 --> 3:55:40.840]  ivermectin hydroxychloroquine and interferon worked in April of 2020. No lockdowns necessary.
[3:55:40.840 --> 3:55:49.640]  No mask mandates necessary. We didn't need Andrew Capo Cuomo to come out on behalf of the globalists,
[3:55:49.640 --> 3:55:55.960]  which he did. Okay, I want to repeat that, which he did for a build back better plan,
[3:55:55.960 --> 3:56:04.360]  all the way back on April 17. Wasn't Kamala Harris, wasn't Joe Biden in this country.
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:09.960]  This guy gave a whole build back better presentation. Let's see if it's actually in
[3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:16.680]  the article. It might be. Let's see if we got it here. Build back better presentation. Here we,
[3:56:16.680 --> 3:56:21.400]  we went through Hurricane Sandy. We didn't build back what it was. You build back better than
[3:56:21.400 --> 3:56:27.320]  before. You take that moment. You learn that lesson and you improve society. It gets worse from there.
[3:56:27.320 --> 3:56:34.840]  He invoked 9-11. Look, you can see it right there. We've played it on the program. This is, and does
[3:56:34.840 --> 3:56:44.200]  Capo Cuomo get even really investigated for policies that led him to be a serial killer in
[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:50.520]  that country? Nope. They make it about grab ass and maybe he said or did something inappropriate
[3:56:50.520 --> 3:56:56.920]  once. No criminal charges there either. He and his brother were ultimately protected by this system.
[3:56:56.920 --> 3:57:05.480]  Not really outed. Not really burned. A limited burn at best. I am Jason Burmes. All my documentary
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:11.080]  films are free. Loose change, Final Cut, Fabled Enemies, Invisible Empire, a new world order
[3:57:11.080 --> 3:57:16.760]  defined all produced by Info Wars. And of course, shade the motion picture. I want you to reach
[3:57:16.760 --> 3:57:23.640]  into those pockets. I want you to watch those movies for free and then go to saveinfowars.com.
[3:57:23.640 --> 3:57:30.040]  Make that donation or infowars.store.com. Grab those DVDs. Grab those supplements.
[3:57:30.680 --> 3:57:34.920]  And I need you to share this information with others because ultimately, folks, it is not
[3:57:34.920 --> 3:57:41.400]  about left or right is always about right and wrong. And we need to love one another and come
[3:57:41.400 --> 3:57:51.160]  together as the great resistance to this great reset. Inside you, like me, fire is burning.
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:55.320]  Something needs to change. I just want to reach out and give a recommendation
[3:57:55.320 --> 3:58:02.120]  to Reset Wars. It's really powerful. Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye opening and
[3:58:02.120 --> 3:58:08.040]  revolutionary. If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex.
[3:58:08.040 --> 3:58:12.600]  Thank you very much for putting the course together. I found it to be awesome. It was
[3:58:12.600 --> 3:58:19.080]  worth it to me. You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with
[3:58:19.080 --> 3:58:25.720]  scientific trust. This isn't about Alex Jones. So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful,
[3:58:25.720 --> 3:58:31.480]  well documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power
[3:58:31.480 --> 3:58:36.760]  structure is censoring and is definitely afraid of. To think the way we are intended to think by
[3:58:36.760 --> 3:58:41.560]  God. That's what this series is about. Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of
[3:58:41.560 --> 3:58:48.840]  uncertainty and it has rejuvenated my hope. It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's
[3:58:48.840 --> 3:58:53.400]  going on in my life. Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the
[3:58:53.400 --> 3:59:00.520]  information far and wide. There is an awakening. Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[3:59:00.520 --> 3:59:07.880]  Reset Wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also learn new
[3:59:07.880 --> 3:59:12.760]  material. I'm not disappointed. I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible. I hear you
[3:59:12.760 --> 3:59:18.280]  coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more. It's moving me. We need to have courage
[3:59:18.280 --> 3:59:23.560]  and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like I got a lot of that from Reset Wars
[3:59:23.560 --> 3:59:30.600]  as well. The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless. This isn't magic. This is the
[3:59:30.600 --> 3:59:38.120]  real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years ago called The Matrix. Start your journey
[3:59:38.120 --> 3:59:55.800]  to true freedom now at ResetWars.com. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
