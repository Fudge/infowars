[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.240 --> 00:31.720]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones there's a headline at the top
[00:31.720 --> 00:38.160]  of prison planet calm that everybody should go read salente predicts revolution food riots tax
[00:38.160 --> 00:47.400]  rebellions by 2012 the British government also predicts that by 2011 the US government has
[00:47.400 --> 00:53.040]  been predicting that I want to be clear here it is not Alex Jones that is predicting all of this
[00:53.040 --> 01:00.240]  I am simply covering what the mainstream media is saying is going to happen just like I said
[01:00.240 --> 01:05.800]  that martial law we're being eased into martial law I said that in articles we wrote back in the
[01:05.800 --> 01:13.000]  late 1990s I've been saying that all year long and my detractors go out deceptively knowing the
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.200]  general public isn't paying attention and say look Alex Jones said that George Bush was going
[01:17.200 --> 01:22.640]  to declare martial law and suspend the election when I actually had Naomi Wolf and all the rest
[01:22.640 --> 01:28.840]  of the liberals on knowing don't you understand presidents are puppets these new powers given
[01:28.840 --> 01:34.280]  to the president these new police state powers these unfounded usurpations of liberty and freedom
[01:34.280 --> 01:41.240]  these these acts of treason will be passed on to the next president and it's bipartisan just
[01:41.240 --> 01:46.160]  like I said Bill Clinton is a puppet you will only see things get worse under George Bush now
[01:46.160 --> 01:54.400]  you will see them get worse under Barack H Obama but it doesn't matter and it isn't about Alex
[01:54.400 --> 01:59.040]  Jones I don't care if people make stuff up and say I'm a liar the point is is that it
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.880]  deceives other people and keeps us from turning things around you know we told you they were
[02:04.880 --> 02:09.280]  going to devalue the currency we told you they were going to create massive inflation and plunge
[02:09.280 --> 02:14.800]  the stock market and kill the economy and we told you how it would start with a subprime mortgage
[02:14.800 --> 02:21.920]  years before it became even a news item because we have the sources we go to the elite meetings
[02:21.920 --> 02:28.240]  we cover them when no one else does you know we know what's happening we know what's coming we
[02:28.240 --> 02:33.760]  understand I mean it's not hard when you go to an urban warfare drill a decade ago and you witness
[02:33.760 --> 02:40.480]  troops training to confiscate our guns and admitting it on videotape there you are I mean
[02:40.480 --> 02:46.160]  that this is what's been going on under the surface now it's like a cold sore rising to the surface
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.160]  so people can see it we're under martial law when private banks have governmental power
[02:52.160 --> 02:57.600]  and use the executive to threaten the house of representatives with martial law if they don't
[02:57.600 --> 03:05.760]  pass a banker takeover bill now five weeks almost six weeks later they are coming out and saying
[03:07.120 --> 03:12.160]  oh we're changing the rules of the bailout and they keep using the 700 billion dollar term
[03:12.160 --> 03:20.000]  when ap bloomberg the congress ron paul are all saying it's really five trillion and two
[03:20.640 --> 03:25.680]  already spent and two trillion of that and counting every day hundreds of billions
[03:25.680 --> 03:31.840]  the federal reserve says we're private we're above the law and we are not going to tell you
[03:31.840 --> 03:37.840]  where it went your money now now that's on their news hour not here but instead of the american
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.920]  people trained to be decadent slobs trained to live in denial instead of saying man ron paul and
[03:43.920 --> 03:52.560]  alex jones and bob Chapman and all these other individuals were right instead of saying man red
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.840]  beckman was right or bob schultz was right or instead of saying you know the countless thousands
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.800]  of patriots that understood history that read i heard darry brownfield this morning on the genesis
[04:02.800 --> 04:09.840]  network before me driving into work on 90.1 i heard him saying you're reading from what money
[04:09.840 --> 04:17.360]  magazine in 1988 about how there would be international currency crises after the year 2000
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.520]  and how then they would have a new brettan woods and call for a global banking system to control
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.000]  the world's currencies and you you would still have your national currency but it would be
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.360]  internationally pegged and internationally controlled so it's really a global currency it
[04:31.360 --> 04:37.120]  just has your local look i mean all we did was read the trilateral commission's promise
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.720]  to do this all we did was tell you what the elite said they were going to do
[04:42.800 --> 04:49.280]  and instead people do mental gymnastics to deny what's happening and going on huge broadcast
[04:49.280 --> 04:55.920]  lined up today stay with us the websites are info wars dot net prison planet dot tv and drones
[04:55.920 --> 05:03.760]  report dot com truth news dot us hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long
[05:03.760 --> 05:08.000]  time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.640]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have
[05:12.640 --> 05:16.800]  your own bread you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for femen to take care of your
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.680]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[05:21.680 --> 05:26.080]  bailout for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the
[05:26.080 --> 05:31.920]  telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[05:31.920 --> 05:37.120]  owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:37.120 --> 05:42.560]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[05:42.560 --> 05:47.840]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[05:47.840 --> 05:52.880]  until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems
[05:52.880 --> 05:57.520]  as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing
[05:57.520 --> 06:02.000]  to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.880]  up prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[06:06.880 --> 06:11.280]  everything is zeroing it on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[06:11.280 --> 06:16.240]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[06:16.240 --> 06:20.320]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by having
[06:20.320 --> 06:24.720]  a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so

[07:12.240 --> 07:15.200]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[07:19.200 --> 07:23.120]  the number one message we have got to get out to everyone worldwide
[07:24.480 --> 07:30.960]  is that the united states europe canada australia new zealand are completely and totally seized
[07:30.960 --> 07:35.120]  by private banking interests controlling our governments
[07:36.800 --> 07:43.600]  they also by financing and paying off the different branches of government have had
[07:43.600 --> 07:50.640]  government illegitimately give these private institutions governmental powers kind of like
[07:50.640 --> 07:57.840]  in england or germany or russia a rich banker could go with you know a million ounces of gold
[07:57.840 --> 08:06.640]  gold or a couple of chests of rubies or diamonds and buy a barony buy title and then be made a
[08:06.640 --> 08:17.200]  lord or a baron or a a vicount and that's exactly what's going on and it wasn't just that they
[08:17.200 --> 08:24.160]  wanted the title lands of the palaces it was that they wanted the power and the above the law
[08:24.160 --> 08:31.440]  the nature of it because they never really changed english law they only partially changed it after
[08:31.440 --> 08:38.000]  magna cardam and now as tony blair when he first got elected in 97 said i overturn magna cardam and
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.480]  he did it through executive fiat just as the kings had done previously to 1215 and he said through
[08:46.480 --> 08:52.800]  the queen never forget it in the bbc it was a declaration of war against the people he said
[08:52.800 --> 09:02.320]  we hereby abolish magna cardam under the directive of the queen go pull those stories up he went
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.680]  into the parliament people were gasping but that was it the cameras the face scanners the police
[09:07.680 --> 09:17.040]  state the secret arrest all of it accelerated the gun confiscation and that's all this is
[09:17.040 --> 09:24.720]  this is that we have an internationally waging war on the population worldwide they are depressing
[09:24.720 --> 09:30.880]  the real economy by cutting off liquidity cutting off financing cutting off currency to the entire
[09:30.880 --> 09:38.000]  world so you have a depression in the real economy of plunging but only for now of many
[09:38.000 --> 09:47.280]  commodities especially oil down like 55 dollars a barrel right now you know what the price is
[09:47.280 --> 09:58.160]  this morning in the united states for wholesale 87 octane do you know what the gas stations on
[09:58.160 --> 10:09.840]  average are paying out of the gas trucks a dollar 20 then they add the taxes and the
[10:09.840 --> 10:16.720]  rest of it on top so you're paying two something but the point is that is meant to kill venezuela
[10:17.280 --> 10:24.480]  kill russia kill the middle east drive everybody into bankruptcy they tricked the arab imams they
[10:24.480 --> 10:30.000]  tricked the sovereign wealth families they tricked the middle class of the planet and a lot of the
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.720]  new bow reach and a lot of the sovereign wealth isn't part of the inner anglo-american elite
[10:34.720 --> 10:39.760]  into investing in hedge funds into investing in these these cash machines where you get 15 20
[10:39.760 --> 10:46.240]  percent interest every year investing in imaginary derivatives and at the key point the new world order
[10:46.240 --> 10:52.080]  as we told you almost three years ago i went to canada i got detained for 15 hours i got screamed
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.880]  at and cussed at and told you're going to go to prison if you try to go cover the bilderberg group
[10:57.440 --> 11:02.160]  are you planning to attack the conference we're going to put you in a canadian prison
[11:04.400 --> 11:07.680]  don't believe me google it was all over canadian news only reason i got out
[11:08.480 --> 11:15.920]  and then we went and we had our sources inside and we said they're going to pop in 2008 the subprime
[11:15.920 --> 11:22.480]  mortgage by designed to start a global implosion so they can consolidate and daniel estlund said
[11:22.480 --> 11:26.800]  you're going to see the worldwide economy implode because they want people to be fuel
[11:26.800 --> 11:33.360]  surfs and to be bankrupted go watch in game blueprint for global enslavement watch the hour
[11:33.360 --> 11:40.880]  extras watch in game 1.5 at prisonplanet.tv over an hour and a half of the extended interviews
[11:40.880 --> 11:48.400]  as daniel estlund and jim tucker and myself and separate from them dr michael kaufman
[11:48.400 --> 11:55.280]  with the documents and with the internal sources tell you exactly what is going to happen and it
[11:55.280 --> 12:07.760]  happens exactly like we tell you we don't make broad predictions we make precision
[12:07.760 --> 12:17.920]  predictions we make precise predictions because we're not predicting anything
[12:19.360 --> 12:26.720]  you know i hate to knock myself down a peg here but it's just like i go outside to see big
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.360]  thunder clouds rolling towards me with rain falling a mile away and i walk in and say honey
[12:31.360 --> 12:39.120]  rain is on its way you better go close your trucks windows
[12:40.880 --> 12:49.600]  or give me your keys where are they a storm is blowing in or oh news aid austin is reporting
[12:49.600 --> 12:56.720]  hail is falling in central austin coming south we better go park our cars in the garage
[12:56.720 --> 13:06.800]  and then when the hail comes you know my wife is a run up and say you're some type of psychic you
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.000]  you how did you know no i mean it was it was hail it was coming i mean all i'm doing is telling you
[13:16.800 --> 13:20.240]  and so now that we've broken down what they're doing and what they're carrying out
[13:20.240 --> 13:27.760]  people all over the message boards at prisonplanet.com message board uh on the comments on the stories on
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.760]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com we'll post a story write a story like this one
[13:35.760 --> 13:42.640]  salente predicts revolution food riots tax rebellion by 2012 and the reason i'm talking
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.800]  about this is it goes to the mentality of why we can't turn this around and why the new world
[13:46.800 --> 13:53.920]  order is moving against our society because the establishment knows we have a willful denial population
[13:57.760 --> 14:05.280]  and uh this guy the trends research institute has got about a 97 accuracy rate in predicting things
[14:05.280 --> 14:08.960]  and he specifically predicts down to the month when things are going to happen
[14:08.960 --> 14:16.320]  and so what do they say about salente and myself and others
[14:17.680 --> 14:22.800]  they go into the comments and they say oh it's easy i could predict it'd be an earthquake in the next
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  three years and then of course there's going to be one or it's easy i can predict there's
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.440]  going to be a war and of course in the next three years four years there'll be a war he
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.360]  doesn't predict that he predicts he predicted two years ago that there would be a giant
[14:37.360 --> 14:45.520]  housing bubble crash and that there would be runs on commodities and runs on derivatives
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.080]  and he specifically predicted now not that it was hard i mean globalist publications
[14:52.080 --> 14:56.080]  and insider publications but they're not talking to the public they're talking to themselves
[14:56.080 --> 15:00.000]  they're not secret documents but they're not widely distributed it all stayed to what was
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.480]  happened i'm gonna get the sky on the show but instead of going hey we better listen to the
[15:04.480 --> 15:10.000]  british ministry of defense saying their job will be to suppress riding populations the next four
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.680]  years that was last year or we better listen you know to the fact that that these top trends
[15:15.680 --> 15:20.640]  experts and futurists have been predicting exactly what happens in the past they're predicting this
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.200]  now instead of saying hey let's have a debate about that they just say you're a bunch of lion
[15:25.200 --> 15:37.840]  cokes making it all up or i talk about how they would incrementally put more people in prison
[15:37.840 --> 15:47.600]  build more fema camps have more federally funded checkpoints i talked about how they use the
[15:47.600 --> 15:52.240]  patriot act in non-terror related cases i talked about how they train our children to
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.040]  tattletale on the parents i talked about how they would introduce incrementally
[15:58.720 --> 16:00.480]  citizen tattletale brigades
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.440]  i predicted because i was reading what the federal government said they were gonna do
[16:09.440 --> 16:13.040]  i wasn't predicting anything we were posting the document showing you what they'd said
[16:13.040 --> 16:22.960]  and people just say you're a liar isn't real none of it's real i mean they're openly this weekend
[16:22.960 --> 16:28.320]  meeting to set out the framework for the next two years to devalue the world's currencies
[16:28.320 --> 16:34.240]  simultaneously that's already happening the dollar hasn't risen 10 cents from the 60 cents it lost
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.280]  other world currencies have dropped on average by about 20 percent in the last six months
[16:39.280 --> 16:42.720]  and if you actually read the financial publications they admit that
[16:45.440 --> 16:51.520]  it isn't that the dollar rose worldwide the banks in concert together the big private
[16:51.520 --> 16:59.280]  central banks the private owners of our economies they are devaluing the currency simultaneously
[17:02.880 --> 17:08.160]  and their meeting to openly set up world government run for and by the banks and you
[17:08.160 --> 17:14.560]  will pay carbon taxes and regulations and money transfer taxes to private banks now
[17:14.560 --> 17:18.800]  operating as world government that is in the times of london afp
[17:18.800 --> 17:25.680]  Reuters i mean it's in hundreds of publications a day now it's everywhere they're calling in a
[17:25.680 --> 17:30.880]  new world order there's Rothschild's all over tv bragging that it's a quote world government
[17:30.880 --> 17:38.320]  word for word and still the public invested in denying the public invested in saying we were
[17:38.320 --> 17:44.080]  liars the public invested in saying there was no problem mentally and so just like a george
[17:44.080 --> 17:49.760]  bush supporter like i said yesterday who still believes wmds ran iraq 30 percent of the public
[17:49.760 --> 17:56.560]  or more depending on the poll you got 30 40 percent of the public democrats and republicans
[17:56.560 --> 18:01.840]  who were invested in the fraud and so they can't even admit that trillions are being stolen by
[18:01.840 --> 18:09.520]  private banks right now with the bank or takeover bill and i know i spent a lot of time focusing
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.000]  on their denial because all of us are in denial to certain degrees about everything i'm in denial
[18:14.000 --> 18:23.200]  about not leading a healthy lifestyle compared to what i should do i'm in denial about my work ethic
[18:23.200 --> 18:30.000]  working too much and then when i am working not managing my time right or focusing
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.240]  there's a lot of things we're all in denial
[18:38.880 --> 18:44.240]  but it has to stop folks it's too dangerous what we're going into because here's the deal if you
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.520]  stay in denial and and let this get worse and and by denial a lot of you know what's going on but
[18:49.520 --> 18:55.360]  you just are procrastinating that's the form of denial you're not taking action if you don't take
[18:55.360 --> 19:01.280]  action if we all don't take action in little ways every day they're gonna win they're gonna get the
[19:01.280 --> 19:05.760]  next phase the next step in their operation completed and i'll tell you what that is when we
[19:05.760 --> 19:11.520]  get back into a bunch of news bunch of clips alex jones here with a question what does humidity mean

[23:48.080 --> 23:53.200]  herald solenta the ceo of trim's research institute is renowned for his accuracy in
[23:53.200 --> 23:57.680]  predicting future world economic events which will send a chill down your spine considering
[23:57.680 --> 24:02.160]  what he told fox news last week that's coming up in the next segment solenta he says that by
[24:02.160 --> 24:08.800]  2012 america will become an undeveloped nation but there will be revolution marked by food
[24:08.800 --> 24:14.320]  riots squatter rebellions tax revolts and job marches and the holidays will be more about
[24:14.320 --> 24:20.640]  obtaining food not gifts he also told upi on an interview that this has been a bloodless
[24:20.640 --> 24:26.080]  coup by wall street they have taken over the government completely criminally and that you're
[24:26.080 --> 24:31.360]  going to see a middle class physical rebellion against them because the middle class is not
[24:31.360 --> 24:36.240]  going to have a choice this was echoed last year by a british ministry of defense report
[24:36.240 --> 24:42.560]  but they said their job will be suppressing the middle class and ensuring that we are enslaved
[24:42.560 --> 24:47.920]  they even say that we try to take any capitals and remove the criminal government the armies
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.720]  the british and us army are going to use a neutron bombs on us that's right the neutron
[24:52.720 --> 24:58.960]  weapons that won't destroy the infrastructure are for us they will kill all life forms 200 feet
[24:58.960 --> 25:04.480]  below even the surface of the earth with an average neutron detonation over a city the size of
[25:04.480 --> 25:12.320]  chicago that's what the neutron bombs are for they have enough for every city and the elite
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.120]  have openly stated that they will take us down and soft kill weapon us with the chemicals in the
[25:17.120 --> 25:22.800]  food the mercury in the vaccines were spraying in the air and any revolts any any trying to
[25:22.800 --> 25:28.960]  wriggle out of it will be responded to now you say the army won't carry that out and you're right
[25:28.960 --> 25:34.560]  that's why by 2012 half the air force will be drawn and they're even phasing out human pilots
[25:34.560 --> 25:39.760]  where they're where they run pre-programmed operations and then a few hundred elitist
[25:39.760 --> 25:46.320]  with the pre-programmed ai computer interfaces will be able to launch an attack which of course
[25:46.320 --> 25:51.680]  could kill the entire population of the world if they so choose or just kill certain cities
[25:51.680 --> 25:58.480]  see folks we're not joking around here on this show this is what we face and i want the police
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.360]  in the military and all of you to grow up and to look at the documents that your own bosses are
[26:03.360 --> 26:09.200]  writing out and realize that you're only there to orderly feed us into the meat grinder and then
[26:09.200 --> 26:14.000]  there's a group right behind you to orderly feed you into the meat grinder and then a group to
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.080]  feed them into the meat grinder just like stalin and hitler and every other one dead but this is
[26:18.080 --> 26:25.920]  high tech this is um this is moon raker people love to have analogies or parallels through
[26:25.920 --> 26:32.720]  movies go watch moon raker but they aren't planning to run off to a space station while they kill us
[26:32.720 --> 26:39.040]  with a biological weapon and then repopulate the earth with the uber men uh no they plan to go to
[26:39.040 --> 26:45.280]  underground bases while they kill us now i'm not saying they're even ever going to carry this out
[26:45.280 --> 26:50.480]  i'm saying they're powerful they have all the money they control the issuance of money and the elite
[26:50.480 --> 26:58.080]  are saying it not me so we're only in an early phase of this while they're got the world all
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.480]  into the stock market pulled the rug out from under them they're squeezing down the market so
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.520]  they can consolidate the markets with vertical integration poses the saviors while they loot
[27:07.520 --> 27:12.560]  the treasuries blind and then claim the populations of the west owe these tens of trillions of dollars
[27:12.560 --> 27:17.120]  to the very private banks that were paid the money that's right we pay the taxes and we
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.680]  suffer the currency devaluation for the pleasure of paying them the money to buy up our farms
[27:23.680 --> 27:29.120]  our ranches our roads our governments our infrastructure i can't stress that enough
[27:30.000 --> 27:37.120]  and uh again it's cold-blooded i mean if you were a cold-blooded robot you know a a war game
[27:37.120 --> 27:44.160]  computer and your job was to consolidate power in the hands of a small group of families and you
[27:44.160 --> 27:52.480]  were programmed to do that and you had a control grid a a a a a a a interlink of cameras systems
[27:55.360 --> 27:59.760]  again i'm simplifying this for analogy what would you do well you would go through you know the
[27:59.760 --> 28:08.080]  safest battle plan the safest chess game would be just a you know slow march with safe moves
[28:09.520 --> 28:14.320]  to ensure that no one struggled out of your net you would brainwash the public get them to disengage
[28:14.320 --> 28:21.120]  from media and culture and only be spectators to be programmed by the upper culture to be
[28:21.120 --> 28:26.560]  mindless dumb sloths for being an idiot is cute and funny and being mindless and greedy you know
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.920]  was neat and not caring about your neighbor is cool so nobody cares about you you get people in
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.760]  massive debt you poison them you brainwash them you dumb them down you terrify them with terrorism
[28:37.760 --> 28:42.160]  to accept living in a police state you hurt them in the compact cities then you have even worse
[28:42.160 --> 28:48.320]  financial collapses controlled bio weapons releases which again you always blame on foreign enemies
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.240]  which is then the excuse to attack those foreign enemies while at the same time attacking your
[28:52.240 --> 28:57.600]  domestic slave population we're all enemies of the new world order they see us as an enemy
[28:57.600 --> 29:05.520]  they're attacking us all we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[32:13.920 --> 32:21.040]  i was a highway man along the coach roads i did ride i just can't believe that so much of the public
[32:21.040 --> 32:30.480]  is bored people claim that they want to kill time their life has no point we're out here on the
[32:30.480 --> 32:37.200]  beautiful planet spinning around a gorgeous sun cold depths of space the heavens around us
[32:39.280 --> 32:47.680]  they enfold us we are part of the universe part of the timeless void the oceans the trees the
[32:47.680 --> 32:56.080]  atmosphere our families all the people humanity the line that reaches back into antiquity
[32:57.520 --> 33:04.960]  and into the prehistoric and as we look forward into the line of humans we live on to the species
[33:07.520 --> 33:13.120]  that's why it angers me and pains me deep in my heart my soul my basic programming
[33:13.120 --> 33:19.360]  and when we see the human animal hybrids the part human part insect the part human part pig
[33:19.360 --> 33:27.120]  part human part cow part human part dog to see the human genetics being put in foods we eat
[33:28.080 --> 33:38.000]  mixed with cockroach genes fish genes you name it and then the public denying it even exist
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.960]  irrevocable damage to the ancient biosphere on the planet true environmental crisis
[33:42.960 --> 33:47.600]  mounting meanwhile the public has been suckered into at least about half of them into believing
[33:47.600 --> 33:52.720]  that carbon dioxide is deadly poison and must be taxed so the elite can divert us into something
[33:52.720 --> 34:00.160]  that won't help the environment while they go on destroying it saying they don't care they're
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.920]  going to rebuild it the elite believing they're god believing they're going to remake the planet
[34:05.920 --> 34:12.080]  and their horrid image all right here's some of the news i've gotten i'm gonna get into all these
[34:12.080 --> 34:17.040]  clips and open phones today we do have bob Chapman for his once a week vision on the economy in the
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.480]  fourth hour today and colonel craig roberts they're getting into the police state martial law how to
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.440]  deal with it if society breaks down he was a highly decorated marine corps sniper also uh
[34:27.440 --> 34:34.080]  retired as an army intelligence colonel uh then of course uh in his years out of the military
[34:34.080 --> 34:41.360]  was a swat team commander helicopter pilot uh police pilot uh investigated the federal bombing
[34:41.360 --> 34:47.920]  by the feds of okc investigated the murder of police and others who investigated that the
[34:47.920 --> 34:55.200]  torture and then murder of good cops so he'll be uh joining us coming up in an hour we'll take
[34:55.200 --> 35:04.800]  calls before he joins us at 1-800-25-99231 first time callers go to the head of the line just
[35:04.800 --> 35:14.560]  tell us your first time caller 1-800-25-99231 but uh salente predicts revolution food riots
[35:14.560 --> 35:22.640]  tax rebellions by 2012 and in this fox clip he says a lot but in an interview with upi
[35:23.280 --> 35:26.640]  he said there will be a revolution in this country he said it's not going to come yet
[35:26.640 --> 35:31.760]  but it's going to come down the line we're going to see a third party and this will be the catalyst
[35:31.760 --> 35:36.720]  for it the takeover of washington dc and broad daylight by the wall street in this bloodless
[35:36.720 --> 35:42.400]  coup talking about what happened six weeks ago it's almost six weeks now and it will happen as
[35:42.400 --> 35:47.280]  conditions continue to worsen the first thing to do is to organize with tax revolts that's going to
[35:47.280 --> 35:52.960]  be the big one because people can't afford to pay more school tax property tax any kind of tax
[35:52.960 --> 35:58.160]  you're going to start seeing those kinds of protests start to develop the first thing
[35:58.160 --> 36:04.320]  to do is to organize tax revolts and it goes on it's going to be very very bleak very sad
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.080]  and there's going to be a lot of homeless the likes of which you've never seen before
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.200]  tent cities are already sprouting up around the country and we're going to see many more
[36:13.680 --> 36:19.680]  and he went on from there and um he's just made so many incredible predictions that are accurate
[36:19.680 --> 36:28.080]  and right um you know people do listen to folks that have been right in the past and we don't have
[36:28.080 --> 36:33.120]  the time the energy to go back and find all the hundreds of accurate predictions we made
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.800]  not even predictions where i read what the club of rome cfr collateral commission said they do
[36:40.800 --> 36:50.240]  10 years ago six years ago two years ago a month ago so we're gonna maybe listeners can grab those
[36:50.240 --> 36:53.680]  and post them and bring them to our attention we just don't have the staff we're too busy covering
[36:53.680 --> 37:03.760]  what's happening right now but that is a way to wake up some sheeple in other news um i told you
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.400]  that they would give you a national ID card in the name of stopping illegal aliens while doing
[37:08.400 --> 37:13.360]  nothing but having a few highly publicized raids arresting a few thousand here a few thousand there
[37:13.360 --> 37:18.000]  less than 15 000 a year in these raids when you have three million illegals coming out of the
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.520]  country a year one million legals and now governor rick perry with homeland security
[37:23.520 --> 37:29.120]  wants to have statewide driver's license checkpoints where they say they will shut down
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.120]  entire highways and search everyone that was in the houston chronicle yesterday
[37:33.120 --> 37:39.840]  and guess who comes out complaining oh we may not be able to do this because this
[37:39.840 --> 37:45.360]  would discriminate against the illegal aliens well don't worry cops already when they stop
[37:45.360 --> 37:48.880]  you if you're an illegal alien they've been told let you go i've had cops admit it police have
[37:48.880 --> 37:54.880]  been in the news sheriffs have arrested hundreds of illegals before uh you know just in a night
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.080]  stopping drunk drivers and they are above the law because they have no papers no one knows who they
[38:00.080 --> 38:06.800]  are and ice won't get them so i told you years ago they would propose internal checkpoints the
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.640]  name of stopping illegal aliens but they're just going to legalize them with the new north american
[38:10.640 --> 38:16.800]  id card that we played the federal tv ad for last week we played the audio here the north american
[38:16.800 --> 38:22.080]  travel pass see they're just going to make them legal and then stop everybody and check to see
[38:22.080 --> 38:29.840]  that you have them and uh you know i told you domestic checkpoints that matter of supreme court
[38:29.840 --> 38:32.880]  said you can't do it doesn't matter the fourth amendment says you can't do it they're doing
[38:32.880 --> 38:38.160]  it all over the country under the guise of dui and illegal aliens and the rest of it now they
[38:38.160 --> 38:44.400]  could just simply sell because the illegal aliens you know don't go get inspection stickers they
[38:44.400 --> 38:50.160]  don't go get uh any of this and then pull them over they could just stand there with probable
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.880]  cause looking at the stickers on cars but they don't because they are reprimanded and get demerits
[38:57.680 --> 39:01.840]  always for some other reason this is on record this isn't just me this is mainstream news admitting
[39:01.840 --> 39:07.440]  this if they touch the illegal aliens so no i'm against these uh these these warrantless
[39:07.440 --> 39:18.400]  checkpoints they are not for illegal aliens i want to go to your phone calls because curl
[39:18.400 --> 39:21.280]  craig roberts just called he wants to come a little bit earlier and i want to take your
[39:21.280 --> 39:28.640]  calls we'll also take calls when he is on with us um got a lot of audio clips i want to play today
[39:28.640 --> 39:34.560]  too but right now let's uh there's a bunch of these up on prisonplanet.com his predictions
[39:35.200 --> 39:40.320]  you know videos of him years ago on tv predicting the exact financial crisis we're having now
[39:41.280 --> 39:47.040]  but uh here's a quick clip with uh gerald salente by the way i thought to have on this morning we
[39:47.040 --> 39:51.600]  already called him and he's we're setting him up probably tomorrow or sometime early next week
[39:51.600 --> 39:58.080]  also lining up a ralph nader again because his plane was late uh but uh here he is on fox news
[39:59.280 --> 40:07.360]  two days ago all right thanks guys hey if uh gerald salente wasn't right so many times he'd be
[40:07.360 --> 40:14.000]  dismissed as another doom and gloom crackpot but he has been right and he has predicted correctly
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.760]  many many times well now he's looking ahead to four years of president obama get used to saying
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.920]  that and at least two years of solid democratic control on capitol hill now here's a quick synopsis
[40:25.920 --> 40:33.120]  he says that by 2012 america will become the first undeveloped nation of the world there will be
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.520]  another tax revolution gerald says in america marked by food riots squatter rebellions tax
[40:39.520 --> 40:46.480]  revolts and job marches and on a less political note salente says that the holidays will be a
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.720]  toned down affair getting food not gifts will be the priority gerald salente joins me now
[40:53.360 --> 40:59.760]  for some diamond dialogue he's the eo of trans research institute good to see you again sir
[40:59.760 --> 41:04.320]  thank you for having me all right we picked the uh big three trends to focus on because you have
[41:04.320 --> 41:10.320]  many but let's focus on the the most immediate this holiday season i know in our family we're
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.640]  already saying we're doing secret santa you get one person that you pick you get one gift for the
[41:14.640 --> 41:18.880]  adults a lot of people are cutting back for christmas well you know we're going to see a whole
[41:18.880 --> 41:24.320]  change of the christmas spirit no more of this obligatory gift buying so in one way people are
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.360]  going to get back to maybe the holy meaning of the holiday that would be a shock wouldn't it
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.960]  so we're going to see gifts that are handmade handcrafted the local communities are going to
[41:34.960 --> 41:40.320]  do very well the ones that hold those winter festivals less people going to the mall more
[41:40.320 --> 41:46.800]  local shopping and more of the gift giving of maybe making things you know with changing foods
[41:46.800 --> 41:52.000]  like baking cookies exactly um that's going to really hurt retailers which we're all expecting
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.640]  this uh christmas we're going to see the beginning of the end of a retail christmas you know that
[41:56.640 --> 42:00.960]  i mean this is they just invented this thing maybe a hundred years ago you know it wasn't
[42:00.960 --> 42:05.760]  always like this so we're going to see a fundamental shift take place with people right there they're
[42:05.760 --> 42:11.920]  going to be backing up a few seconds that's what i told my wife and we never buy a lot of junk
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.560]  and we always try to give books or films to people and i'll go to the bookstore and and you
[42:16.560 --> 42:20.240]  know buy interesting informative books and give that as gifts and for children i always try to
[42:20.240 --> 42:25.520]  give them something creative but you know art supplies or something uh you know other people's
[42:25.520 --> 42:30.720]  children as well but i told my wife i said look let's just have the family event of making fudge
[42:30.720 --> 42:36.080]  or making cakes or you know and our christmas cookies it's fun to decorate you know we've
[42:36.080 --> 42:42.720]  always done that but let's only do that uh because this is all an invention of edward

[53:21.680 --> 53:27.200]  i hurt myself all right john and canada'll go to you in just a second the commenter on the story
[53:27.200 --> 53:33.600]  to see paul watson wrote up on prison planet dot com salente predicts revolution food riots tax
[53:33.600 --> 53:38.960]  rebellions by 2012 he's saying hey why are they putting this on the news to fair monger to create
[53:38.960 --> 53:45.440]  fear absolutely that isn't saying salente's bad he knows they've engineered this in fact in separate
[53:45.440 --> 53:50.960]  longer interviews he says that but they're just they're bringing him on now to say this and not
[53:50.960 --> 53:54.960]  two or three years ago when he was first saying it because now it's time to really panic people but
[53:54.960 --> 54:01.200]  go back two and a half years ago when i got back from bilderberg in canada and i said they planned
[54:01.200 --> 54:07.680]  to demonize the economy and talk bad about uh real estate prices to pop that bubble so that
[54:08.400 --> 54:15.280]  the economy implodes so they can consolidate we wrote stories about it and remember how they
[54:15.280 --> 54:18.720]  badmouthed and how they'd say it was so bad and then it would start sliding and they would then
[54:18.720 --> 54:25.120]  pose as saviors so they do both psychologically they pop the balloon the bubble then they pose as the
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.320]  savior uh it's basic psychology once you sit back and start analyzing and don't just sit down in
[54:30.320 --> 54:35.280]  front of the tv and just mindlessly turn your brain off and believe whatever they say it's totally
[54:35.280 --> 54:42.000]  clear they're a bunch of smiling crooks trying to fool you and make it look confusing and bamboozle
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.800]  you it's simple they said they take the bailout money and give it to people to get the economy
[54:46.800 --> 54:50.880]  going they're hoarding it all and getting and using it for bonuses and now they say they want
[54:50.880 --> 54:57.040]  even more money or they won't restart the economy they got a gun to our head all right uh let's
[54:57.040 --> 55:04.400]  go ahead and go to a first time caller john in canada you're on the air hi alex how you doing
[55:04.400 --> 55:10.160]  good sir all right uh i just want to say first off you got great music on the show it's never
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.000]  talked about and it's you got a great taste well we got a lot of other great music i just haven't
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.640]  had time to give it to john about the network to play but thanks right okay uh i got a statement to
[55:20.640 --> 55:28.800]  say um with uh i'm really i'm really admire i really admire how much you put so much emphasis
[55:28.800 --> 55:33.360]  into the truth and you you don't back down when someone says something else and you have proof
[55:33.360 --> 55:37.840]  to say the other thing so what what i got to say to that is have you ever looked into what the
[55:37.840 --> 55:43.440]  bleep or the holographic universe i'm all down with everything you have to say but there seems to be
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.280]  a lot of proof to show that our thoughts help shape reality and i was just wondering if you
[55:47.280 --> 55:53.200]  looked into that very much our thoughts do shape reality by imagining a new bridge or a new aircraft
[55:53.200 --> 56:00.480]  or imagining laser beams 300 years ago and now their reality or imagining helicopters 400 years
[56:00.480 --> 56:06.240]  ago you know with the famous uh inventors you know drawing pictures of you know imagining hot
[56:06.240 --> 56:12.320]  air balloons a thousand years ago and and now they have them uh you know egyptians notice that you
[56:12.320 --> 56:18.480]  could put a a a a cloth bag over a fire and it would rise up to the ceiling and they tried to
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.680]  build hotter balloons but then when you get into total imaginary thinking like they have a lot
[56:23.680 --> 56:29.600]  in india it's all about the inner mind so so what if there's rotting homeless corpses everywhere
[56:29.600 --> 56:34.560]  and human feces everywhere because it's all beautiful in the mind there has to be a balance
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.000]  i mean flesh does shape the day for sure but there is enough studies out there with a random

[1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:27.120]  but when you urinate on the first amendment that our veterans fought and died for
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:32.000]  you become an enemy of the republic so back off stop committing crime but but go ahead

[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:51.760]  up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com uh all of the 911 truth groups all of the
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:57.120]  anti-new world order groups the the pro second amendment groups all of you i love you i want
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:01.520]  to thank you all i want to commend you a lot of them get mad though and they say we've emailed
[1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:07.760]  you a bunch and you've never contacted us because i don't have time to hardly do anything you know
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:13.120]  i'm sorry hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:17.440]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and
[1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:21.760]  water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:26.560]  never have to go to the super dome and beg for femen to take care of your family in any emergency
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:30.960]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail out of a special
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:35.360]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and emailed
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:40.160]  they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:45.280]  owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:50.800]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:56.240]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until
[1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:01.680]  it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may
[1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:06.800]  be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:11.760]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:17.040]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one
[1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:21.680]  third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[1:05:21.680 --> 1:05:26.640]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's
[1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:30.400]  very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the government
[1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:35.600]  the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:39.840]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:44.880]  you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from ecoli salmonella

[1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:53.360]  john and canada darrell in hawaii matthew in texas according to him fred and philly
[1:06:53.360 --> 1:07:00.160]  dan sharyl vernin we're going to get to all of you starting at the bottom of the hour because
[1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:04.880]  colonel craig roberts has been a syndicated talk show host in his own right a best-selling author
[1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:10.720]  over and over again he's been a police officer on the swat team he's been an investigator police
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:16.720]  helicopter pilot marine corps sniper in vietnam lieutenant colonel in the army working in
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:23.920]  intelligence on and on and on he's worn so many hats and um he's pretty much gotten out of the
[1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:28.800]  publishing business now he's got a few of his books left in print you can get it his website
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:34.800]  riflewarrior.com and he doesn't even really do a lot of radio anymore uh he's just uh i guess
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:38.480]  pulling in his feelers and working with his family to get ready for what's coming down
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.840]  but we're honored to have him on with us until about 15 after next hour we're going to be taking
[1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:48.880]  your calls but there's a host of issues i want to discuss with him today now when we talk about
[1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:53.680]  obama being a marxist you can understand the public view of a marxist is some well-meaning
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:59.840]  uh ne'er-do-well who doesn't understand that socializing people's wealth doesn't work no no no
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:06.640]  big banks the elite that's imploding the economy they are the ones that always fund marxists
[1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:11.760]  throughout history and socialists and fascists as carol quickly said at georgetown you know who
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.440]  wrote the uh official history the internal history for the cia that was then published
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:22.560]  of how our country really works and they said we fund the communists we fund the fascist anyone
[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:28.960]  who consolidates wealth anyone you know who can create government control to then give big
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:36.640]  corporate contracts and bailouts and and giveaways to corporations and so his whole family are
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:42.400]  marxist his father his mother all of his advisors terrorist that's not even denied
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:48.800]  but the bigger issue is now they're coming in with the carbon tax now obama's a puppet
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:52.800]  he's going to carry out the same agenda just different flavor and i wanted to get colonel
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:58.800]  craig roberts take on him briefly but then get into the martial law scenario as we incrementally
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:03.360]  are eased into martial law the congress threatened with martial law that didn't pass the bailout
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:09.440]  five weeks ago everything that's happening uh they're announcing random checkpoints nationwide
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:13.840]  but it's not for illegal aliens it's for everybody the illegal aliens are going to be allowed to
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:19.760]  leave i've read the fine print here in texas uh so so all of this going on uh because he's been a
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:24.640]  police officer he's been an investigator he's you know been a colonel in the military so many
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:29.280]  angles and a researcher and author he's a great analyst so colonel roberts uh thanks for coming
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:35.920]  on with us today i'm glad to be back alex alex give us your take on obama and what you think
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:43.040]  is in store for us well i think this guy uh you know i mean he's he is beyond a marxist he is a
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:48.320]  communist uh and you know i'm i'm sure he and putin are going to be very good friends because
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:53.440]  what he his agenda and his agenda always has been if you go back and just do your homework and
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:58.640]  research where this guy came from and this stuff he's done and he's passed he is not pro american
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:04.400]  he's pro globalist and he's pro globalist on the international socialist scale uh to where
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:09.840]  you know uh he wants to reduce the united states down to second world status and he wants to do
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:14.160]  his redistribution of the wealth which i i you know i wrote about that fifteen years ago that
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:17.680]  that's what these people try to do they take from those that have they give to those they think
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:22.240]  needed but they don't take it out of their own pockets uh you know they want you to go out there
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:26.560]  and work and they want you to raise your taxes and they want to you know get your money out of
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:30.480]  your bank account and then they want to turn around and dole it out as they see fit but what
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:35.440]  they really do is they're not helping people what they're doing is they're buying power they buy
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.240]  votes uh they take ignorant people who don't do their homework or who don't understand or just
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:43.680]  plain stupid and they and they tell them this is what we're going to do for you if you just vote
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:46.720]  for me we're going to you know we're going to take care of you we're going to house you we're
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:49.920]  going to feed you you're not going to have any taxes you're going to be taken care of and what
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:55.280]  they you know this this goes back to the great society even goes back to uh fdr where uh you
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:00.720]  know a chicken in every pot that whole enchilada is easily bought by people who are a stupid
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:06.480]  be lazy or c want the free handout and so what happens is there's there's so many people out
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:10.560]  there who really you know that they should have to pass a test before they're allowed to go in
[1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:13.920]  the voting voting booth they don't understand the constitution they don't understand what this
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:19.120]  country's about they don't understand uh you know what our rights are or are not and yet they turn
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  around and they vote for people who offer them things and that's the way this election went
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:29.200]  so they've got obama up there uh you're wanting to uh use the power of the presidency to do stuff
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.120]  that that the president just simply can't do and they're going to get a very rude awakening
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:36.160]  they're going to come back later on and they're going to say well whose fault is it well the
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:40.320]  democrats always turn around and play the republicans well there's no republicans and uh you know
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:43.680]  the republicans don't quote control congress now so they're going to turn around and say well it's
[1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:49.280]  the policies of the republicans in the past and so on and you know out of way he's saying now no
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:56.960]  reversal on torture uh no reversal on guantanamo for now uh troops stay in iraq uh he's saying that
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:02.720]  they are going to continue basically all of the same policies he's going to go ahead and hire
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:07.360]  lobbyists uh he's going to go ahead and do everything he said he wouldn't and by the way
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:13.200]  mccain i'm against socialism but mccain actually wanted to give some of the money to the people
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:18.720]  with the mortgages and obama said no it all goes to the foreign bankers who now admit they're just
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:24.320]  keeping the money for bonuses and this weekend they're setting up open world government uh
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:28.880]  with the remodernization of the debt new currencies i mean everything we talked about is actually
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:33.040]  happening and they're going to have this front man there to fool the left to go along with it
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:38.320]  oh yeah yeah and you know alex before i you know go off on a different tangent here i just want to
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:42.640]  let everybody know that the republicans are just as much to blame you know and this is assuming
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:45.920]  now we're just we're just going to have to put this on ivory tower and assume that there was
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:49.840]  an honest election and we know there wasn't uh for several reasons we know there wasn't but
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.720]  the other thing is you go back to who counts the votes and you know uh we get into a real quandary
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:59.680]  but let's just assume there was if so the republicans that we've got up there the so-called
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:05.200]  conservatives are you know i guess you know you call them neocons i call them neorepubs because
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:08.960]  they're they're rhinos they they they're weak sisters they don't do anything they get along
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:14.400]  with the other side they make they make deals they compromise and a true conservative american
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:20.720]  patriot does not compromise period ever because what you do uh when you're talking about marxists
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:24.080]  and socialists and communists what they do is they go into the inchworm effect and that is
[1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:28.480]  go a little bit forward until they meet resistance and they back up and go around the resistance
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:32.400]  go a little bit forward you know a true hardcore Stalinist will come you know he'll kick your
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:36.240]  door in and he'll come in with guns blazing and take over the place and say my way or the highway
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:42.880]  but uh uh uh uh a fabian socialist which which these people are the the Schumer's and the polo
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:48.080]  uh uh uh you know the the the kennedy very hard to beat because they're incremental yeah they're
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:51.360]  incremental and and what they do you know two steps forward one step back but they still get
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:55.600]  their way and they've been doing this since the 1960s in our lifetime and before that you go back
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:00.880]  to the you know the 1800s and 1850 on and they've been doing it all over the world in europe and
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:05.840]  russia uh so you know this is what we're seeing now and they've got to the point where they started
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:10.320]  doing things and both parties are at fault here because they've allowed it to happen we've got
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:14.480]  to the point where we've got the patriot act one and two we've got that we've got nafta we've got
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:18.400]  open borders we've got multiculturalism we got political correctness we've got god out of the
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:22.720]  church and god out of prayer and out of the state uh you know the functions and so on so let me
[1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:27.120]  just send a rub before i forget remember obama said he would end nafta and get that he backed off
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:32.240]  then he hires as a chief of staff the headgun grabber for handgun control link the guy that
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:38.720]  passed the assault weapons ban uh the the whip that did it and the guy that got nafta passed
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:43.840]  under clinton i mean talk about betraying his mindless constituents go ahead oh yeah and but
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:46.400]  there's so many people out there that he's going to tell them it's a good thing and they're going
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:52.080]  to believe it simply because it came out of his mouth and and it just it's incredible how stupid
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:58.480]  people can be uh you you know i i had a t-shirt designed and i wore it to the big watermaker
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:03.120]  gun show here about a week ago it's the biggest gun show in the country it's 14 acres of tables
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:08.240]  under one roof and the t-shirt has a has a donkey on the front with this red circle around it with
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:13.200]  a stripe through the middle you know no donkey and over at the vietnamese word sat kong and sat
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:19.280]  kong uh he basically is you know kill communist uh and people stop and say well what's that all
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:23.360]  about and i got more comments on that and i said you don't understand the democratic party in this
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:28.640]  country's been taken over by the communists a long time ago the the the cpusa went away
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:33.680]  and reemerged in the lower levels of the democratic party worked the way all the way up to the dnc and
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:38.160]  they brought their agenda with us you know and the trotskyites founded the neocon movement
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:42.720]  that took over the republicans in the 90s that's right and so you know both sides have direct
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:48.800]  links to moscow or beijing uh are both and and the people don't do their homework they said
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.840]  they're you know they're they they they they're their brain dead watching football on tv and
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:56.880]  worrying about uh you know what they're going to do this weekend and the next fishing trip
[1:15:56.880 --> 1:16:02.640]  or bean bank and and they they totally are clueless about what goes on in government and
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:06.560]  they've let government run the country instead of them running the government and and everything's
[1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:09.920]  upside down now and they wonder what went wrong well they're going to find out what
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:14.800]  went wrong here pretty soon because when this guy gets in he's going to be just like the clintons were
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:19.520]  when they first got into office they had their agenda and three ring binders already typed
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:23.920]  up and ready to go and they threw a staff in there and they started pat you you remember
[1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:27.760]  alex we talked about this years ago when they started passing all those gun laws right and
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:33.600]  left so fast that what they got was a springboard effect uh they they they did so fast and so hard
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.200]  that uh people rebelled against it and they bought guns like they're going to have style
[1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:40.560]  they bought ammunition and stocked up on i went to one gun show people were coming there with
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:45.280]  dollies taking out cases of ammunition and stocking up they thought there was going to be a war
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:49.760]  coming and then we had waco then we had Oklahoma city then we had uh you know of course we had
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:54.640]  the 1993 bombing of the quick twin towers and so on down the line and and people are going uh hey
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:59.280]  we got to stock up more stuff well what it did it created a counter to what they were doing
[1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:04.320]  and it resulted in an election that threw most of the democrats out and put the
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:10.320]  and that's all the new order agenda so the clintons bombed okc well yeah we know that
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:15.360]  that they benefited from it for sure but here's the deal we're going to see that again because
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:20.640]  but i don't think you investigated that you know ok season inside job oh yeah i was sure of course
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:27.120]  it was but you're just not specifically saying they pulled the trigger yeah go ahead yeah we we've
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:32.480]  talked about this at infinitum but uh you know to stay on track with this what they're going to do
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:37.440]  this time this is what i i prophesy you know uh i'll just i'll just kind of think ahead of the
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:41.040]  jet here for a little bit i think that they're going to come in and they're going to start
[1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:46.640]  sliding these gun control things in on earmarks on other bills that people don't notice they're
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:52.240]  going to be small but they're going to come in and they're going to slowly but surely uh eat away
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:57.600]  at the foundation of the second amendment uh this guy hates handguns he's going to probably try to
[1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:02.880]  make the ownership of handguns altogether illegal yeah when he was in the senate that's where all
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:08.160]  this comes from folks when he was in the illinois senate he called for banning all semi auto
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:13.280]  handguns and rifles i mean confiscating them they're not playing games they want you to be their
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:20.400]  slaves they needed this army to do that with the days getting shorter and the nights getting longer

[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:55.520]  will not answer if they could that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:22:00.480]  they are now they would also have to admit that they will need a retreat something completely

[1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:29.360]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:35.280]  that we've set we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful
[1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:37.840]  just as strong just as well-funded
[1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:02.800]  okay backline with a message from the government
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:08.960]  like colonel craig roberts and this craig continuing people are in denial his chief
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:14.160]  of staff says he wants everybody but this will be separate from the pentagon he says it's like
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:18.960]  national guard training and it'll be under the same rules in his book in the legislation
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:26.480]  in uh barack obama's own website though they pulled it over the weekend that you will go now
[1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:32.400]  under the department of labor and that you will train with weapons and that you will be
[1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:38.080]  a million-man domestic spy force and that they will deploy different people around the country
[1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:40.800]  i mean that comes right out of nazi germany or soviet russia
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.320]  you can't have a dictatorship without your own private army of a geheim statspolize
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:53.840]  and uh so that's that's what he's he's evidently got in mind uh stall and did it with the kgb uh
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:59.600]  you know uh mao did it with uh whatever organization it is in chinese that he had you have to have
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:04.320]  your spies you have to have your block captains you have to have your snitches you have to have
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:10.640]  people that you can rely on that are you know uh totally loyal to you but don't take order from
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:14.880]  the military the pentagon because a pentagon can't be trusted you know that the military has taken
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:19.760]  a note to defend his support defend the constitution and uh so that's not going to fit his agenda he
[1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:23.760]  wants people that are going to take an oath to him you know his little zeke howl bunch and if you
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:30.960]  get on the youtube and you look at the you know the uh the the uh obama ugand the obama youth
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:35.120]  schools that he put in where they they march around like little nazis beat their chest and salute you
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:39.840]  know uh you know barack obama did this for me barack obama did that for them i mean
[1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:44.320]  and you look in their eyes you can see these kids are brainwashed and anytime you see that in history
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:49.920]  i mean i have studied history just like you have kernel and i have never in us history seen the media
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:54.960]  call him the one the president of the world the one that will fix it all and and the media
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:25:00.640]  seriously is out pushing this they don't folks don't know history anytime you see that in history
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:06.640]  look out how they might the mainstream america media is simply a proper gang organization
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:12.320]  uh you know for the left it's it's been that way for a long time uh probably since sometime in the
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:18.400]  1950s uh you know when when uh tail gunner joe mccarthy had the uh the big witch hunt for the
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:23.040]  for the uh communist uh everybody laughed at him you know later on they said oh he's nuts he
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:26.400]  didn't know what he's talking about and it turns out he was right all the time you know and we don't
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:31.680]  have a house committee for the investigation of unamerican activities anymore uh they did away
[1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:35.840]  with it there's something that would it be nice to have to find out you know who these people are
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:39.760]  and where they come from you look at obama and you go back you know the guy can't pass a security
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:44.880]  test uh test he cannot do they you know i did i did some research to find out you know what
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:49.520]  qualifications does somebody have to have to become the president of the states when it comes
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:54.720]  to their background checks to the security uh uh investigations that have to go on when i was
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:26:01.360]  working in intelligence i had to get a top secret uh um clearance every year just to make sure i
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:07.760]  hadn't done anything in the last year and uh i was i was sci which is uh uh compartmentalized
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:12.320]  uh in other words i could go into safe inside safe and so on so forth and they they checked
[1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:15.600]  everything they went back i don't know how many generations they talked to my neighbors they
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:18.720]  talked to my friends they talked about people that worked with me they talked to everybody
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:24.160]  that's what i was about to say is that people can say this is wrong that he's hired by the
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:28.320]  american people and paid out of tax money so therefore the president of the states should
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:32.720]  be able to pass the same security clearances that the generals in the pentagon have to pass
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:38.320]  he's going to be their boss now why should he have access to all of the of the information
[1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:44.080]  that's it's uh in every vault out there um do where he we don't know who his friends are we don't
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:47.360]  know who he's going to pass it on to you know i mean he could be a spy at the highest level who

[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:02.880]  I
[1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:14.320]  Colonel Craig Roberts is our guest a friend of mine
[1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:18.880]  gotta have some kind of a pen or something the future so I can hang out with him
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:23.440]  best-selling author of one shot one killed
[1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:29.120]  book on sniping
[1:31:30.880 --> 1:31:33.760]  had a whole bunch of us sellers until he started writing books about the new world order and they
[1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:39.040]  said look we know it'd be a best seller but we aren't publishing it talk about those before he
[1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:42.720]  leaves us 15 minutes to the next hour I want to go to your phone calls
[1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:48.640]  but I want to get these questions out first shifting gears
[1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:55.040]  the police are being militarized they're trying to brainwash them trying to bring in a tyrannical
[1:31:55.040 --> 1:31:59.600]  culture cops all over the country colonel I get videos of them welcome to folks saying you can't
[1:31:59.600 --> 1:32:08.000]  videotape you can't protest you can't hand out literature we have the police being told that
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:12.960]  martial law may come because of the economy even mainstream news is reporting it they were ready
[1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:21.200]  in case Obama didn't win for the election as well what is going to happen as as there isn't
[1:32:21.200 --> 1:32:26.400]  money for property taxes and there isn't money to pay the the speeding tickets I mean I mean you
[1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:29.440]  can tell the police are cash trapped because before they wouldn't give you a ticket around the
[1:32:29.440 --> 1:32:34.960]  country unless you were five miles of the speed limit now they wait down hills hoping you accidentally
[1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:40.160]  go three miles over to give you a ticket around here in Austin Texas I mean they admit they want
[1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:44.400]  to squeeze more and more money for revenue but it's just not going to be there a lot of political
[1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:48.240]  experts even mainline pundits are saying that there's going to probably be a revolution in
[1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:53.280]  this country Fox News was reporting that we played it earlier in the last hour what is going to
[1:32:53.280 --> 1:32:58.000]  happen as the people get squeezed and squeezed and squeezed in the international bankers by design
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:05.440]  implode our economy well you know this has already happened in England and now you cannot own
[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:10.800]  property in England you can lease it for 99 years the crown owns it and I think that this is
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:14.640]  where we're going right now because if these mortgages are all being bought up by the federal
[1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:17.760]  government then who's going to own the property the federal government what are they going to do
[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:21.760]  with it they're going to lease it to you they're going to make the payment so you can afford it
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:26.480]  but eventually there will not be private property in this country if these people have their way
[1:33:26.480 --> 1:33:32.880]  about it I think when it gets to the point to where the middle class which is the plow horse
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:37.680]  it's the one that you know that that plows the fields and makes things grow and and and develops
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:44.480]  the economy that when the middle class when that horse dies then there's not going to be anything
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:49.600]  to feed this machine that keeps getting bigger and bigger and hungrier and hungrier um so you
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:53.120]  got a race horse you got a dead horse you got a plow horse when the plow horse is gone the
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:56.960]  race horse can't pull a plow and the dead horse isn't going to do anything and that that's the
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:01.520]  welfare into the country on the dead horse so what happens at that time well people are going to
[1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:06.080]  go to they're going to revert back to survival mode and the ones that that they you know do their
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:10.960]  homework in advance who prepare in advance who see this coming uh... who band together who
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:17.440]  communicate uh... teach their kids who do all they can to to be able to survive through this
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:21.440]  are going to do it as individuals and small communities there isn't going to be a big
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:25.440]  national movement um i don't i just don't see that happening in the country because of the
[1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:29.760]  educational system what's done to our kids over the last thirty years let me throw this in and
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:35.840]  i agree with you um people say well why should i own gold if they can come confiscate it well
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:39.360]  it's better than the bank account where they can come get it or why should i own property they can
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:44.560]  just take it or you know why should i you know they might come get me absolutely there's no
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:50.160]  perfect world folks you just got to make the best preparations you can and you better get to know
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:54.240]  your neighbors and you better even if you're gonna stay in the city and work have a place to bug out
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:35:00.240]  to and yeah you gotta make that decision am i gonna let paramilitary goon squads or whatever
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:05.600]  take my children away take me to a relocation center or you know uh commandeer the food i've
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:10.720]  got that's all in the executive orders they've been preparing for this for decades and decades
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:15.520]  kernel and now they are uh... announcing to the public that they are going to do it the whole
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:20.400]  time with the media saying they're the good guys so what do you expect the police to do
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:25.040]  versus what they should do i don't think the police are gonna do anything i think that's
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:30.080]  what's gonna happen from you know what i've been able to find out is like we've talked before
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:33.760]  you know here's obama i didn't think he's gonna bring our troops home why because he doesn't
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:38.480]  want him here there's too many patriotic uh conservative americans in the military
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:41.520]  you've got to get those guys out of the country the national guard the reserves you're gonna
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:46.000]  wear them out you got to get them out of the country when you when you have a situation occur
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:50.800]  here let's say massive civil disorder for whatever reason food riots race riots whatever whatever
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:55.680]  reason it is even if it's trumped up even if it's if it's uh instigated by the the new
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:36:00.560]  world order pukes what what we have to understand is they're going to pull in foreign assets
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.760]  they're going to pull in blue helmets from other countries they've been training them for a long
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:08.560]  time they've been training them in russia and you can uh uh you go slavia and in the Balkans
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:12.960]  by the way people always deny this uh earlier this year and they sounded a few days before
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:20.320]  a few years before that canada and mexico signed deals quote for domestic disturbance
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:24.240]  inside the u.s. please continue that's right and you know it's supposed to be to help us
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:28.400]  out of course you know if we have another Katrina or whatever you know but but those
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:34.720]  are the guys that are close they can bring people in from uh you know the the chinese
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:39.040]  have the biggest merchant shipping fleet in the world with the biggest ships you can load
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:43.200]  those those ships up with as many troops as you want and drive them right into san diego and
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:48.000]  long beach in san francisco uh and unload people you can fly people in you know when
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:51.360]  they start doing this they'll do it because the government says they're going to help us
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:55.760]  they're our friends they're our ally now see i would think of this as insane and crazy and
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:00.960]  they never get away with it but they have all these generals and Wesley clark and all of them
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:06.240]  telling the troops this is going to happen getting them ready tell folks about that well
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:09.600]  yeah you know you know we're back in uh... uh... several years ago
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:14.720]  this plan was already developed in and uh... uh... bary mcgaffrey who was a general in the
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:18.720]  army at the time went to cascue uh... class at uh... four leavenworth kansas that my nephew
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:23.440]  was in and he was a young west pointer a captain he done two tours of somalia and he was graduating
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:29.360]  from the command and staff college up there and and uh... clark or uh... uh... uh...
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:35.200]  the general came in there and he and he was introduced and you know mcgaffrey was introduced
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:38.400]  as a member of the council on foreign relations will immediately brian stood up and took notice
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:41.120]  to that started taking notes and afterwards he called me he said you're not gonna believe what
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:46.160]  this guy said and i said what's that he said he said with us committed if he says if we ever get
[1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:49.520]  committed on two fronts because we weren't at that time this was in the 90s he says we ever get
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:54.080]  convicted uh... committed on two fronts because the build-down in the armed forces we will not
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:58.560]  have sufficient assets at home to handle civil disorder and i'm thinking wait a minute the
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:03.360]  military is not supposed to handle civil disorder to begin with and then he goes on to say
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:07.120]  that we will be forced to call upon foreign assets to patrol our streets
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.280]  so this this plan uh... that was initiated by the council on foreign relations uh... you know
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:16.640]  the decade and a half ago is is a you know it's on the shelf it's ready to go what do you do with
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:21.040]  all the people that you have to deal with well you have you've got uh... three choices you've
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:27.280]  got deadly weapons you've got non-lethal weapons and you've got relocation you know the relocation
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:31.440]  breaks down into the volunteers you know get on the bus we're going to get you out of here
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:35.120]  there's a biological hazard there's a radiological hazard whatever we're going to move you to a
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:40.880]  safe location till it's okay to come on uh... the other one is uh... the the non-volunteers
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:45.760]  that that they'll just simply go out and say okay you refuse to take your few shots or you
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:50.400]  you know you you refuse to take the marker you refuse this you know you're going with us period
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:53.600]  your kids are going over there you're going over here and you know the husband's going to the
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:58.560]  work gang actually in the dark winter scenarios the pentagon put out top off one two and three
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:04.080]  and the drill they are starting today uh... if you don't go along with them and quote you may be
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:10.160]  contaminated they just go ahead and burn your farm down or kill you so they're publicly admitting
[1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:14.080]  that they've trained them for that yeah and you know let's go back to what you said earlier
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:19.040]  uh... we didn't address that what are you going to do if somebody comes to take your gold well
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:25.040]  they got to find it first you know i think you don't just simply sit there on the coffee table
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:29.760]  folks if you're going to invest in gold put it someplace safe give it a military funeral
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:33.840]  somewhere uh... you know you can do the same thing with ammunition you can do the same thing
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:39.360]  with food i mean you have to think ahead you have to think defensively and you can't have
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:42.960]  everything you want no one goes towards what you want you go to war with what you have
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:49.280]  and so you have to think of what are you going to do if we get into a totalitarian society
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:54.640]  and it becomes so dictatorial that you have no choice but either go along with it fight or die
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:58.400]  and by the way congressman brown who's on a lot of committees has gone public
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:03.680]  saying look there's open discussion about this and then and then congress uh... five weeks ago
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:09.760]  was threatened with marshal law if they didn't pass the banker takeover bill which again was
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:14.320]  unlimited trillions that's not seven hundred billion it's already five trillion they've
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:19.040]  sucked out two trillion they won't say where it went and they actually threatened congress
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:23.920]  with marshal law and i've talked to republican and democratic congressman who were told that
[1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.160]  under house rules they were told you can't tell anyone or they can be kicked out of the house
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:32.800]  i think those rules are wrong i mean we've got to that point colonel the it's really happening
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:35.760]  how well the government's been taken over by the communists is as simple as that
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:39.760]  uh... we don't control government anymore it's a rogue elephant it's out of control
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:44.640]  uh... you know what we have to do is like an america with a cave they still have the congress
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:50.480]  there yeah it's it's just not our congress no it's it's it's the comradeship you know so
[1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:56.240]  you know with the the problem is when i was in school in the fifties and sixties we learned
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:01.920]  about communism we you know i can still uh... you remember words like you know communist manifesto
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:07.440]  and carl marx and and uh... linen and stalling and all of all of that and dialectic materialism
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:13.360]  you haven't heard that one a long time these kids today don't get any of that education is left out
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:17.760]  on purpose and they don't get much american history what they do get an american history has
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:22.640]  all been so corrupted that uh... you know world war two is two pages and something else that
[1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:27.360]  socialists is fifteen pages it's it's incredible what they've done to kids and in the government
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:33.120]  school systems so now you don't know how to identify the enemy if you've never been trained
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:37.280]  on what the enemy looks like well craig forget that the the average kids don't even know where
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:41.680]  the u.s. is on a map literally well they can't spell they can't read and write they can't you
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:45.760]  know i don't know what was all the government documents which was done by design no it's
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:49.840]  it's a you know i mean it's you sit there in your mouth just falls open because
[1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:54.480]  i you know i'm at the age where i can compare what it was like in the sixties seventies eighties
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:58.320]  nineties and what it is today but the youngsters they can they don't have anything to compare it
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:02.240]  with all they have is what their friends tell them who are smarter than their parents they always
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:07.440]  have been and their teachers who are pretty much controlled by the n e a in the n e a is a global
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:12.320]  socialist u n organization but but let's explain we're not saying commies under the cupboard
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:16.800]  the rocker feller foundation the carney foundation they had house hearings in the seventies
[1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:23.600]  they cold-bloodily said to enslave everybody will socialize everything to get control and
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:28.720]  break up the families and then we'll have global surfs under a world government's control run by
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:37.040]  the private banks well yeah the excuse me i've been dealing with a terrible chest cold i have to
[1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:41.840]  it's been for weeks i think you know that i hit the cough button right then it was coughing while
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:46.560]  you were coughing that's funny i don't know if it's a chemtrails or what it is it's it's terrible
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:54.080]  man oh but uh... you what what we're having right now is a failure to communicate were you
[1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:58.560]  then those of us who know what's going on are not communicating well with our neighbors our
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:02.000]  family and our friends now they say a profit is never you know a man is never a profit
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:04.880]  in his own village and i found that to be true and i think everybody else has it's
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:08.960]  ever tried to talk about this to their family or their close friends you know i talked about
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:13.840]  this years ago in our police department i got labeled in that then after i retired i had some
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:18.720]  of those guys that worked in intel or pd call up and say hey we want to know some more because
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:23.520]  you were just way ahead of your time and i said well it's too late i don't you know it's just
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:28.640]  you know you got too much homework to do but i talked about all this in my book kill zone when
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:32.320]  i go back you know beyond the kennedy assassination i go back into the powers to be and what their
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:36.960]  agendas are and i talk about the education and i talk about the the carnagies and i talk about
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:41.280]  the the ford foundation and i talk about you know uh... the rough child plan
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:44.880]  and all of that and people have read that book and they fall into one two categories one is
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:51.680]  total disbelief and denial and the other is i want to know more well you know you find out that
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:56.480]  about twenty percent of the population wants to know more and wants to get involved in
[1:43:56.480 --> 1:44:01.120]  about probably forty percent i'm hip shooting this about forty percent are well yeah i kind of
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:05.120]  believe it but i don't want to get involved i don't really want to know more because it scares me
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:09.040]  and then the rest totally just denied every uh... being a possibility
[1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:14.240]  and so i've run into that over and over again but we gotta remember there was only what seventeen
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:20.240]  percent of the population fought the revolutionary war well about four percent started it
[1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:25.120]  yeah i mean it was a very small uh... percentage
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:33.840]  and and beat the british army so uh... it's it's not uh... yeah there's a small group of them and
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:39.360]  there's a small group of us and they operate by lying and stampeding the mindless herd we have to
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:43.680]  find people who aren't mindless in the herd and get them activated to start warning everybody and
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:48.720]  that is happening i'm seeing a huge awakening kernel i i want to go to some phone calls and
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:51.760]  we're gonna do that for the break and be with us fifteen minutes in the next hour graciously
[1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:54.640]  rifle warrior dot com's the website be sure and check it out but kernel
[1:44:56.240 --> 1:44:59.280]  you know i've had spiritual experiences that i don't talk about on air i just
[1:44:59.280 --> 1:45:04.080]  just leave it that but but but death experiences near death experiences but you did die
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:08.080]  are something universally people have pretty much the same type experiences
[1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:14.320]  and uh... you know i think that story you tell us so important for people that don't realize we're
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:19.840]  only here once this life is a test it's so important a lot of people are called they're scared
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:25.600]  they'll understand that we're we're here to be tested by this tell folks that story please
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:29.920]  because it's so important well in the august of nineteen ninety seven i'd been going to
[1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:33.840]  about a six month battle with colon cancer that metastasized and went all over my body
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:38.240]  i kept getting sicker and sicker and and i was on chemotherapy at the time
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:42.560]  which uh... that that turned out to be the problem that was the big mistake
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:47.440]  and um... i got to the point where i got down to about 160 pounds and i couldn't hardly get
[1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:53.280]  out of bed and and one day i i'd i'd try to stand up to uh... out of bed and fell on the floor
[1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:58.640]  uh... long story short my wife called 911 the fire department showed up first my blood pressure
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:02.960]  pressure was 60 over zero and falling ambulance showed up next they said i wouldn't make it to
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:09.040]  the hospital they loaded me up took me to the hospital and i got into the ER and i was on a
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:14.160]  gurney and the doctors came in and they said uh... that uh... they want to know if i had a living
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:18.560]  will and i said i don't know i don't know what living will is i've got a will they said no this
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:22.320]  is this is a you know do we unplug you if you know you're not going to make it and i said i'm
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:26.000]  going to make it and they said well we got six doctors in here to work on you tonight i said
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:30.320]  now you got you got seven i said god's here you just listen to him you just pay attention to what
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:34.160]  he says and he'll guide you through it and they and they kind of got a chuckle out of that and they
[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:38.400]  said well uh... we're not expecting the best and they turn around start to walk out and then orderly
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:42.400]  came in and you start to put a tube down my throat or down my nose and and that's all i knew
[1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:48.640]  the next thing i knew uh... i was not there anymore i was sitting in a big dark room it was
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:52.960]  cool it felt comfortable i felt perfectly healthy i felt like i was like twenty three years old
[1:46:54.800 --> 1:47:01.360]  i i didn't care at all about this life anymore time meant nothing and i knew that i'd come through
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:06.640]  a portal or a doorway or something to my left and there was another one on my right and the
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:12.000]  decision was being made to take me on or send me back and i also knew that in front of me there's
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:17.840]  a portal that would open up that would send me straight to hell hell exist folks heaven exist
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:23.760]  this is real stuff i didn't make this up i didn't dream it i knew that my guardian angel was there
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:28.240]  that i'd known all my life as my individual is my invisible playmate when i was a little kid
[1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:34.640]  he was standing behind me his name is joe and he was communicating with me uh... that this decision
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:40.800]  was being made and i felt like i was there about three minutes and i was being downloaded all
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.080]  kinds of information that i didn't know what it meant but they said you'll run into certain people
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.440]  in your life that you'll be able to give this information to they'll know what it means it's
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:52.640]  important to them but you've got you know uh things that you have to do you've got people
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:58.000]  you need to talk to you've got more work to do for us so um that was basically it and the next
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:04.720]  thing i knew i opened my eyes and i was in icu and it was 18 hours later i felt i was gone three
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:10.080]  minutes and they of course they buzzed the docs and one of them came in and he said uh he said i
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:14.560]  don't know what happened he said you flatlined he says you were gone three minutes and so that's
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:18.400]  three minutes i felt like i was gone i don't know what happened to the other 18 hours because time
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:22.560]  really didn't mean anything and he said there's no way you could have survived but you did he said
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:27.520]  we ran out of a negative blood that's all he said you were hemorrhaging internally we used up oh we
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:32.320]  used everything we could and for some reason you stop bleeding and and we got a heartbeat and that
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:41.200]  was that was my uh after death experience absolutely thought-provoking and that's what

[1:51:54.960 --> 1:52:04.560]  was driving home to the texas hill country and it was dark i was looking at all the cartel lights
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:10.400]  going one direction and the headlights going on the other i looked out to see a distant sunset
[1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:16.160]  red on the sky it was dark where i was and i just thought about how amazing our lives are how
[1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:22.640]  incredible creativity is how good and decent the innocent are but on the other side of that there
[1:52:22.640 --> 1:52:27.680]  is the wicked globalists who love death and destruction love enslavement love to dominate the
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:32.880]  good i'm going to tell you right now ladies and gentlemen there is a lot more than what you see
[1:52:32.880 --> 1:52:40.400]  with your eyes what you hear with your ears there's a lot more around us there's a lot of mysteries
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:44.880]  and a lot of people across over the other side have seen what colonel roberts saw we're going to
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:50.000]  go to your calls here in a moment but finishing up with this guardian angel with this with this
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:54.880]  presence that was with you um you know you've told the story in more detail before but any other
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:59.760]  facets to it are i mean what was that like being on the other side well i had no uh
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:05.360]  earthly care about this place um it didn't mean anything anymore it's like it's like uh on an
[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:09.600]  average day you leave uh you leave your bedroom you you close the door and you walk into the
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:13.440]  living room you don't think about the bedroom it's behind you and it was kind of like this this whole
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:20.080]  life what was important was how i had conducted myself in this life you get kind of a gold star
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:23.600]  every time you do something good and you get a black star every time you do something bad and
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:28.560]  those add up uh your guardian angel remembers everything that you did from the day you were
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:35.040]  born on um i don't know if you could call a guy a snitch or not but uh i think that's that's how
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:40.720]  how all all this stuff gets reported later on is is to uh where you end up and you know i i believe
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:45.440]  what the bible says what the bible says uh i don't i don't have it interpreted i don't need to
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:48.720]  interpret anything on it and i know that there's a lot of things in there that a lot of people
[1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:53.200]  don't understand but i when i came back later on i was able to read it and see things i had never
[1:53:53.200 --> 1:53:58.720]  seen before and they're they're people have to understand and i used to have this problem with
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:02.560]  some of these guys that ran these militias they could they they chased the bad guy up just so
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:07.360]  high in the in the in the food chain but they never got to the top they didn't understand
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:13.120]  the real force that they were fighting against was satan himself it's as simple as that there's
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:17.680]  good and there's evil god is in charge of good satan's in charge of evil and god gave us one
[1:54:17.680 --> 1:54:23.440]  thing and that was a that was the uh the uh the the right of choice he gives us the information
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:28.400]  and he says this is what i want you to do he doesn't force us to do it he gives us the 10
[1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:32.960]  commandments he gives us the golden rule he gives us you know the stuff in leviticus and he says
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:37.840]  okay he says now you know what the rules are well craig craig i think that that's what our job is
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:41.680]  i mean not that we're perfect or good ourselves but the people have been warned i mean the roth
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:45.360]  childs are out in the open now saying we run the government and it's a world government
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:50.560]  i mean in newspapers saying world government's being set up and the public reads it and then
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:54.640]  denies it they've been given their chance and that's what the bible means by willful denial
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:59.280]  you know they wanted to believe a lie so god gave them you know gave them over to it they
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:05.440]  asked for it go ahead well yeah it's it's the information's there it takes messengers it takes

[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.560]  you have choices to make but you know you can't make somebody a christian by chasing them down
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:23.840]  the street and beating them over the head of the bible they have to make that choice themselves
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:28.400]  you have to give them the information and step back that's up to them if they decide that they're
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:33.840]  going to go to the dark side so to speak that's a decision that they have made and they're going to
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:38.560]  end up paying for it later if they may if they accidentally go to the dark side because they're
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:44.160]  too stupid to understand that there is good and evil and what is good and what is evil be able

[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:13.200]  all right we're going to take your calls in this segment the next then kernel roberts is
[1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:16.800]  going to leave us i'm going to be with calls and a bunch of key audio clips news i'm covering
[1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:22.640]  bill bob chatman joined us in t-minus 60 minutes ronnie in texas and daryl fred john chanel tom
[1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:30.080]  and others ronnie you're on the air with colonel craig robert roberts rifle warrior dot com well i'm
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:35.440]  so honored thank you sir and to uh... this is kind of old news to many of y'all but to obama
[1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:42.880]  followers and obsters any hope for real change of this ongoing uh... tragedy is evaporated when
[1:58:42.880 --> 1:58:49.680]  obama named long time bill the burger conspirator joe bill the burger biden as his bill the burger
[1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:55.840]  choice and beat chosen vp because in my opinion obama signed his own death warrant with that
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:59:02.080]  election because the evil scheming bill the burgers a secret elite now have one of their own
[1:59:02.720 --> 1:59:07.600]  ready to take over after when obama you know that's right and and and the globalists are very very
[1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:12.880]  racist at the top uh... i mean that they were really uh... hate black people and of course
[1:59:12.880 --> 1:59:18.240]  he's half black he really is an african-american i mean his ancestors weren't slaves is established
[1:59:18.240 --> 1:59:26.320]  from kenya uh... but uh... yeah i mean it's kind of like jfk having lbj as his vp uh... i mean i
[1:59:26.320 --> 1:59:31.840]  agree i think that's could be in the cards of colonel roberts oh yeah you know anytime you get
[1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:37.760]  bill the burgers and cfr royal society from national fair fairs roundtable group trilateralist
[1:59:37.760 --> 1:59:42.160]  they're all they're all you know in the same club basically and anytime you get these people involved
[1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:46.320]  in anything they're gonna bring that agenda in with them and the agenda is the destruction of
[1:59:46.320 --> 1:59:51.440]  nascent nation states the subjugation of populations total control of world population
[1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:57.040]  total control of world economy word world food and world population uh... you know population
[1:59:57.040 --> 2:00:01.280]  reductions one of their deals that's why they're really for abortion uh... you know we could go
[2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:04.800]  on and on with this stuff but it but anytime you get these people involved in something you're
[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:10.960]  poisoning the water well exactly and then look at obama he wants to increase funding for abortion
[2:00:10.960 --> 2:00:18.160]  in africa killing black people all but that's cute and sweet liberal anything else ronnie
[2:00:18.160 --> 2:00:24.000]  well yeah my question about obama's devotion to intensify the truly unwinnable war in afghanistan
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:28.480]  by the way invaders never succeed in the you know try to take over afghan the guarding of the
[2:00:28.480 --> 2:00:34.800]  poppy fields craig how's that going well you know there's two there's two facets about afghanistan
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:40.880]  one is you know whether it's the the golden triangle in laos whether it's columbia whether it's
[2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:46.400]  uh... afghanistan the drugs aren't going to go away that's where the money's at that's that's where
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:50.240]  the the black elements in the world intelligence community get their funding that's where the
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:56.160]  the big you know i mean oil and drugs and gold wonder why the afghans keep fighting it's because
[2:00:56.160 --> 2:01:00.160]  they're fighting over the drugs but that's sorry go ahead you said oil go ahead you know
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:05.920]  there's four elements of wealth in the in the world you talk about oil drugs uh... gold silver
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:12.240]  and uh... but you know precious metals and uh... diamonds and those four areas right there these
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:15.920]  people are you know they're at hip deep and and they're gonna stay there they're not going to have
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:21.680]  to that uh... and that's why they don't want to any of it to be legitimate uh... ties to if if
[2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:26.400]  we had a war on drugs we could stop it but what we do is the war on drugs only goes to knock down
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:31.840]  the competition uh... the main uh... players in this thing have been around for twenty thirty years
[2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:36.000]  so i'm going back to world war two and they're still around that's not going to change so
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:39.600]  but we have to you know we have to look at that and understand that that's what's going on
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:44.480]  as far as is is afghanistan's going there's there's two things about afghanistan one is the drug
[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:51.120]  market the other is the fact that the afghanis have always fought wars two years later basically
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:57.840]  the british went in twice and uh... you know took the place and then they the uh... the moody
[2:01:57.840 --> 2:02:02.560]  whatever you want to call them backed off and and let them have their free will until they decided
[2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:06.000]  that you know this place is subjugated we're good to go we'll send the main force home and just
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.320]  leave a few people here to run the place and they did and when they did of course they got attacked
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:16.160]  and as they tried to leave uh... they were massacred they always do they always play possum
[2:02:16.160 --> 2:02:19.920]  yeah and then they kill you when you pull your forces out of you reduce your forces
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:24.320]  they're very patient they did the same thing to the russians they're very patient unless you
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:28.080]  hit you it's one of the deals where it's like cockroaches if you don't kill every single one
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:31.600]  of them you're going to lose because they're going to come back someday when you're sleeping
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:35.280]  cut your throat that's just the way it is over there well i think patriots in the us need to
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:40.720]  take a page from that if we go into real tyranny colonel well i i think that every patriot united
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:47.840]  states study history absolutely thanks for the call ronnie daryl fred john chanel tom other
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:54.240]  stay with us hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:58.240]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:02.560]  and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:06.800]  bread you'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for female to take care of your family
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:11.760]  in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:16.240]  with a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:20.720]  and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:26.000]  this money now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:31.280]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:36.480]  many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[2:03:36.480 --> 2:03:42.160]  every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:46.720]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:51.200]  refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:55.920]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:00.480]  be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying
[2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:05.840]  food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:09.680]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by
[2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:14.080]  having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:18.960]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:23.600]  of your family in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship

[2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:44.400]  have you on as a guest sometime hey man i just wanted to call in i thank god for you i want to
[2:05:44.400 --> 2:05:49.680]  start by edifying you and what you do i know there's a lot of people out there who are afraid to
[2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:53.680]  take that step alex sir they've woken up they realized what's going on but they're afraid to
[2:05:53.680 --> 2:05:58.160]  get up and get out and do anything about it for fear of the repercussions and i know it's uh
[2:05:58.720 --> 2:06:03.200]  god orders my steps so it's no coincidence i should get on the show today with the colonel
[2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:07.040]  because colonel you're absolutely right we got to make war with what we have and that's why it's so
[2:06:07.040 --> 2:06:12.400]  important that people prepare they get their guns they get their gold they get their uh power you
[2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:16.240]  know energy backup energy and everything they're going to need when they take this thing down
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:22.400]  well that's absolutely correct and and we can't we can't uh we can't fight the war until we
[2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:26.880]  understand there's two fronts to fight that's the that's a physical front and spiritual front
[2:06:26.880 --> 2:06:30.480]  you know all the demons in hell are out there fighting right now against the angels and and we
[2:06:30.480 --> 2:06:34.400]  don't see it but we know it's happening all around us and we have to understand what side we're going
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:38.080]  to be on and we have to also understand we went in the end but we need all the help we can get in
[2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:44.080]  between uh there's those that are going to you know uh go out and and and be on the battlefield
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:46.880]  there's those that are going to stay at home and there's those that are going to sit on the fence
[2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:50.720]  and god hates those that sit on the fence or stay at home they're going to have to answer for that
[2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:57.200]  later on well absolutely in fact jesus says in Matthew 24 and 25 that the time will come when he
[2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:02.560]  returns and there'll be many believer people that believed in him and believed that he'd return someday
[2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:07.040]  but they would say to themselves oh it's been a long time you know things continue on as they
[2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:11.280]  have always continued and they start to drink and get drunk and they make fun of their fellow
[2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:16.000]  servants but jesus says when he comes back he's going to turn to those people and cut them into
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:20.640]  pieces and sign them to a place with unbelievers so i'm i'm taking all those christians out there
[2:07:20.640 --> 2:07:26.000]  who say you believe in the bible yet you know the times are you know the signs of the times are all
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:30.400]  around us but you won't get up you won't get out you won't get busy doing first and foremost the most
[2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:34.320]  important thing and that is sharing the gospel with people that souls may be saved but also
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:40.240]  using this information that alex and uh you know lindsay williams and you and many others
[2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:43.600]  have brought to the forefront of the american people's mind well darryl we've been playing

[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:16.400]  know what if we want to get involved how do we get involved how do we attack these people and
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:21.040]  man you and i talked about putting on a boot camp and uh we really need to do that i'll pay for it
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:25.520]  i'll underwrite it i'll host it i did it the same thing with ray comfort and kurt cameron very
[2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:30.160]  successfully trained a thousand the people to go share their faith and i know if they can
[2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:34.720]  if we can do that and you and i and whoever we could do it could expose the new order no i need
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:38.880]  to i need to get on that i'm trying to finish that studio and everything else darryl that's why i've been

[2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:27.920]  kind of dodging him because i've been so busy i don't want to take on a new project but
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:32.240]  it is an important project and somebody needs to do it and so that's certainly exciting
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:36.800]  kernel roberts has got to go soon so i want to hurry through these calls uh fred in philly you're on
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:46.640]  the air calling from an electric shaver fred go ahead okay let's let fred go john in canada

[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:59.200]  supporter for many years now i'm just uh i wanted and i noticed that you're talking about the um
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:04.240]  the great really awakening you're saying people are getting smarter and more awake and a lot of
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:10.720]  people are getting stupider now um i live in uh i live in canada here in british columbia and i was
[2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:15.120]  walking out i understand the whole about the new world order and their plans and everything
[2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:21.680]  and i was walking down my road the other day and i saw a big spray painted illuminati triangle
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:27.120]  on a uh on a wall and it said uh info orders dot com and it said a whole bunch of uh
[2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:33.440]  facts about the new world order and i mean like they explained like bill deberg and like
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:40.320]  this person actually went out and took time to explain this right and uh basically it said like
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:46.400]  a uh and it had an arrow pointing down like learn the truth and it had a it said free dvd
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:51.040]  and i went up and knowing this i was like shocked and i went up and i picked up one of these dvds
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:11:02.400]  and i put it in my computer and basically what it is is a it's a huge compilation of digital media
[2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:11.120]  articles um really a huge explanation of the new world order and the people that are behind it
[2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:20.000]  and it really like blew my mind and it also has a printable map that you i mean you go down to
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:25.120]  staples you print off this pdf file and you put all these pieces together and it is a map that
[2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:30.480]  corresponds to the actual dvd and all the media so the maps so now you have a
[2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:36.720]  literally like a visual connection that you put together that links onto this dvd and it
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:44.720]  is just mind blowing i mean well that's great i mean send me a copy yeah i'll send you a copy i
[2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:49.280]  mean so now you're seeing that like i'm not only like now i don't really you know feel that alone
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:53.040]  you know i've got a few people in my group that we talk about this good friend well listen you're
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:12:00.480]  not alone the the the new world propaganda is to make us all feel like we're alone when really the
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:05.600]  majority of people know something's wrong they just have no idea how bad it really is and in
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:10.960]  closing uh colonel roberts you want to comment on the power of individuals taking action to wake
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:14.720]  up others well that's the only way you can do it you have to start at the very bottom if you
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:19.360]  don't know as an individual who you're going to talk to that's going to end up being some somebody
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:24.160]  very important later on that takes that information and uses it you you know i talked to crowds you
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:29.360]  talked to crowds we've done it together and uh but we're preaching to the choir choir when when
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:32.560]  people come to see us like that because they know who we are and they've already done some of their
[2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:37.600]  homework but when we go out and we meet strangers that's the time that we need to engage them in
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:41.520]  a little bit of conversation and then spoon feed them you can't dump all this on them at once
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:44.720]  or they'll think you're in that case and they'll turn the other way you have to spoon feed them
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:48.640]  because they're babies they don't they don't get it yet and that's that's where it all starts
[2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:53.200]  and we have to do you know as often as we can there's as many places as we can to get the
[2:12:53.200 --> 2:12:57.280]  information out and if you don't get discouraged that's the big thing a lot of people are going
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:00.160]  to run into they're not going to believe you they don't want to hear it they don't want to talk
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:04.000]  about it that's fine they've made their decision going down the road there's no you know take the
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:07.440]  path of least resistance and go to the next person that's the only way we're going to do this
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:12.000]  and we don't have a choice because the new world order is not going to back off oh no they're
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:15.040]  going to they're going to beat on the door you know they're the wolf outside the door and they're
[2:13:15.040 --> 2:13:18.560]  going to be there beating on the door and we just have to figure out how we're going to build our
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:21.600]  houses or we're going to build them out of straw or we're going to build them out of bricks bottom
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:26.720]  line they want to steal what you've got they want to steal your mind your soul they traffic in the
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:33.200]  souls of men and that's why they're so fired up i mean because they hate goodness they hate
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:39.440]  decency they hate people that are self-sufficient they love enslavement i mean that's just
[2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:44.880]  just uh and listen i appreciate your uh call uh that was very very exciting john and canada
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:48.640]  good to hear from you thanks for holding to tell us that in closing i'm gonna take your calls after
[2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:53.760]  the break folks and stay with us uh colonel in closing in the last few minutes we've got left
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:14:00.720]  here before we end the segment and you leave us you know being a police officer also being in
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:06.480]  the military being in vietnam you know a little more worldly in that you've actually seen evil
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:12.240]  degradation death destruction a lot of people lead such sheltered lives they go from work to school
[2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:17.760]  to home to watch tv they judge the world through their eyes they imagine that everybody's nice
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:22.560]  and sweet like they are people aren't scheming uh because they're not scheming they don't understand
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:26.560]  the true nature of evil that's why women get in the car with serial killers little kids getting
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:31.840]  vans with you know pedophiles and get raped and tortured and killed can you speak to people not
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:38.160]  being naive into the fact that there is true evil and what evil is well you know from the very
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:44.160]  beginning of time uh evil has been half of everything that's out there it's it's equally
[2:14:44.160 --> 2:14:49.280]  balanced uh you know you've got hot and cold male and female night and day uh you know hard and
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:54.800]  soft uh fire and water all this stuff is equally balanced if you you have to understand that you
[2:14:54.800 --> 2:15:00.240]  cannot have good uh and that's the only thing that's around in this in this in this plane and
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:05.360]  this on this planet it's a physical planet and therefore you have evil you have bad things
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:09.440]  or we wouldn't have those languages uh you know those words in our language you've got the bible
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:13.920]  it talks about it over and over again it talks about unrighteous men it talks about satan it
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:19.280]  talks about evil it talks about uh you know death and destruction that that did come from bad people
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:23.520]  that's been here from the beginning it's going to be here till the end and we have to figure out
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:28.800]  where we're going to sit in there but we also have to know that we don't fear it we do not fear it
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:34.960]  we're we're we're braver we're tougher and we're smarter than it is and you you have to face satan
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:40.880]  by saying get the behind me just like jesus did you have to deny him any power i call him old hoover
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:45.920]  because it's like a vacuum cleaner he'll suck up any solely can but if you unplug him you don't suck
[2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:50.480]  very well you know so you gotta unplug the devil and you gotta stand firm in your convictions
[2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:54.640]  and that's that's basically what you've got well i think that's the key and and don't let the devil
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:58.800]  get you down if you're still worldly or still do bad things the point is you're trying to be good
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:03.360]  you're trying to live a good life you're trying to help others and and by committing yourself i mean
[2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:06.640]  that's what i'm getting from what you're saying colonel it's the commitment that you're gonna stand
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:11.040]  for righteousness and good you're gonna fight evil and you're not afraid anymore you're committed
[2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:18.320]  you pass the point of return that is the empowering uh point yeah and and don't fear anything if you
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:20.880]  what are people afraid of they're afraid of getting hurt or they're afraid of dying let me tell you
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:26.000]  something right now getting hurt yeah we all do that dying you don't ever die your body might die
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:30.160]  but you don't folks and so uh you're gonna be held accountable for what you're doing this life
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:35.040]  i've already been there i've reconned it out i've checked it out i'm reporting back don't fear death

[2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:07.600]  treason and that idea got out there well we can do similar things i don't say go spray paint a school
[2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:16.240]  or knockout windows but uh people spray painting government buildings whatever um what if what
[2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:21.280]  if you just put a sign out on your own property or what if you go or all the mindless graffiti
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:27.360]  folks are just putting a lot of it's pretty but you know just a brick abutment where
[2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:31.600]  where it isn't on somebody's private property but where people are already spray painting but
[2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:39.840]  not even that just using chalk and then or taking a photo i think that the caller in

[2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:04.880]  something like that you just don't report it to the graffiti people see it's little things you
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:11.920]  do that will bring the tyranny down and then what if you see that and take a photo of it and then

[2:23:53.360 --> 2:24:01.520]  the longest um man so many calls here uh who's up first chanel in arizona you're on the air
[2:24:02.400 --> 2:24:09.120]  hi alex thank you so much for taking my call my first time caller welcome thank you um this is
[2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:16.640]  a real fight that we're in and um we have to use knowledge and spiritual warfare now the bible says
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:22.400]  that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god through the pulling down of
[2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:30.000]  strongholds and that is how we went um i cited a newspaper to go out to pastors to inform the
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:35.360]  congregations of what's going on because i find that most christians are the most
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:40.160]  un-informed people out there and that's because the rock of fellers with the world council of
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:45.280]  churches in the last hundred years and they admit this to the carnegie foundation took over the
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:54.320]  churches and they pay the leaders of the denominations to keep quiet okay well hopefully um
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:25:00.160]  you know they get it out to their people or even read it um if not you know i'm determined to
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:05.520]  walk the streets and are you kidding are you kidding that is key to reach out to the preachers
[2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:10.240]  that's why fema and the feds do it to i mean absolutely i couldn't think of something more
[2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:18.400]  important yeah and i had a question for you i was watching um brown do his last new world order
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:24.080]  speech and he mentioned that world trade would be going on there's something about beggar
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:30.880]  by neighbor do you can you expound on what that's about well i know gordon brown every two days or
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:36.400]  so calls for world government and police state and the end of the family and carbon taxes and
[2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:41.360]  regulators running your i mean every facet of your life that's the prime minister of england
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:45.840]  for those that don't know but my isd inline cut out right when you said the term what is the
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:55.680]  term he said about world trade beggar by neighbor he said world trade would be beggar by neighbor
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:26:02.400]  yeah beggar by neighbor i did a little bit of research on it on um invest telepedia or something
[2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:09.040]  like that and um it has to do with uh devaluating the currency and important export trade
[2:26:09.040 --> 2:26:15.760]  yeah i didn't know what beggar by neighbor meant but i know they're all calling for a global
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:22.320]  unified currency valuation that shows the banker's power this private group of banks
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:27.280]  and then they will regulate the world uh and and then every time we give more power they
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:31.040]  just squeeze us tighter we give them the bailout they squeeze tighter they steal all the money
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:37.520]  they say they want more uh so beggar by neighbor uh no well thanks for telling us what it means

[2:30:30.560 --> 2:30:44.720]  all right let's go ahead and quickly go to your phone calls because i do want to get into all
[2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:51.440]  these audio clips and news i have before bob Chapman joins us for our weekly visit tom in
[2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:57.920]  colorado you're on the air hey there he is hello my friend and it takes a long time to get through
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:04.960]  to you i got about 10 000 questions i limited to a couple um first of all what happens if obama is
[2:31:04.960 --> 2:31:10.800]  found to be uh tending by birth before the election does that mean what just takes over
[2:31:12.560 --> 2:31:17.040]  i mean i doubt that's going to happen and people are all focused on it because the but the guys of
[2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:21.920]  puppets don't worry too much it may come out later and then they try to have some 20 second
[2:31:21.920 --> 2:31:27.280]  amendment repealed for him which would open the door up for arnold schurzenegger who we know
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:32.240]  openly wants to run for president and he told rollingstone to be our dictator and then king of the
[2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:37.280]  world uh and then the yuppie say no one wants to be king of the world no one in power wants more
[2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:44.720]  power as a conspiracy theory as every world leader calls for world government uh but uh yeah if that
[2:31:44.720 --> 2:31:49.840]  happened they would probably amend the constitution for him saying well it was the people's popular
[2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:54.720]  vote and it's a constitutional crisis and they would uh say the economy's in too much trouble
[2:31:54.720 --> 2:31:59.440]  while this emergency is going on we've got to change this now and they would hurry with
[2:31:59.440 --> 2:32:04.480]  a constitutional convention and rush it through and probably you know change the second amendment
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:10.480]  a bunch of other stuff during the concon absolutely but i'm not sit hold on but people people take me
[2:32:10.480 --> 2:32:16.560]  out of context i'm not i'm saying hypothetically that could happen to your question i'm not saying
[2:32:16.560 --> 2:32:23.120]  that's going to happen yeah the other possibility i'm seeing is that once he gets in office after
[2:32:23.120 --> 2:32:29.680]  he's been our savior for a few months or whatever they get a white supremacist to come up there
[2:32:29.680 --> 2:32:36.640]  and shoot him and that starts a whole race war all over america martial law prison camps you
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:42.320]  know female camps and everything yeah absolutely everybody keeps worrying about that which then
[2:32:42.320 --> 2:32:46.560]  makes me think that that's a direction the new world order won't go now they could certainly
[2:32:46.560 --> 2:32:52.240]  have an attempt on him get some drugged out mental patients who it'll turn out or an army
[2:32:52.240 --> 2:32:59.040]  psychiatric facilities it's always the same who will you know detonate a bomb a quarter mile from
[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:06.720]  him or try to shoot him hitler to make himself sound invincible early on when he first got elected
[2:33:06.720 --> 2:33:12.720]  and to crack down staged bombings against himself uh when when he would say i'm having a psychic
[2:33:12.720 --> 2:33:18.080]  moment i have to leave the podium and he'd leave in five minutes later a bomb would blow up now
[2:33:18.080 --> 2:33:23.280]  later it was a real assassination attempt at the wolf's lair when the general staff tried to blow
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:30.720]  him up uh but the bomb deflected under the big desk and so it only hurt hitler um but um again
[2:33:31.600 --> 2:33:37.280]  with hitler they wanted to kill him because he really was the leader um with with barack obama
[2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:42.480]  george bush bill clinton but i've gotten emails going you can't handle it we've got a black president
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:46.640]  you're just racist that's why you keep saying he's a puppet because you can't have it we have a
[2:33:46.640 --> 2:33:52.400]  black man running things and i'm like no i've always said presidents have been puppets since kennedy
[2:33:53.760 --> 2:33:59.200]  and i'm not even going to respond to your political correctness trying to cow me into not saying
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:02.960]  what's true and what's real uh so that's what's going on what's your second question
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:09.600]  well i'm really i don't care what color of man's skin is if you can do the job and what's important
[2:34:09.600 --> 2:34:15.200]  is who he's loyal to you know well he's loyal to the foreign banks that run the socialism to
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:20.080]  steal our wealth he he wants to take your guns he wants to be your master he wants to enslave you
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:22.320]  like all big foundation fake liberals do
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:30.800]  and people just don't get it oh no no he's going to save our country no he ain't going to save our
[2:34:30.800 --> 2:34:35.360]  country yeah he's going to actually save our country he's going to look like he's saving our
[2:34:35.360 --> 2:34:40.720]  country he's going to make you think he's looking and saving our country but you know while you're
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:43.520]  watching what his left hand is doing over here saying the country the right hand is going to be
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:48.880]  over here and over sovereignty to four nations i hear you and i appreciate your call good to hear
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:55.920]  from you they're in colorado tom derrick and pa you're on the air hello are you there yes sir
[2:34:56.800 --> 2:35:01.440]  all right first of all i'd like to talk on two comments please uh first of all
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:09.280]  rom a manuel talking about how he's going to have a love circle of uh martial law it's
[2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:13.840]  ridiculous how you know you told the new york daily news he said you will be forced to serve
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:19.600]  the government in uniform in domestic spider gauge but he said don't worry it'll be a love circle
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:24.320]  with these fake hardcore liberals they've got conservatives thinking they're a bunch of idiot
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:29.920]  liberals oh but they're not you know liberals they're hardcore social engineers go ahead it's
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:35.280]  it's so sad alex because they try to play off these these feelings of you know the oppressed
[2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:41.360]  public want to be loved and protected by the elite but in reality they're really just being oppressed
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:47.760]  and he called it a love i i saw it on youtube that actual uh that actual i suppose an interview
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:52.960]  with rom a manuel he actually called it a love circle and it's just so pathetic you know that
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:59.200]  the public buzzed up and eat it up oh obama and rom they're going to save us you know the second
[2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:04.960]  point i'd like to make is that uh there's a hip hop artist out there called sage francis and he
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:13.200]  actually uh produced on a song about the denver republican national convention the uh the abuse
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:19.600]  there by the by the uh black suit operatives basically well you know i didn't see it all i heard
[2:36:19.600 --> 2:36:25.040]  the reports of police starting fights but because i didn't see it i said we're getting reports but
[2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:30.960]  now the police admit they went and attacked other cops that didn't know so the so the police could
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:37.440]  then attack the peaceful crowds and take them to a fema camp and uh i mean that's in the denver
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:43.520]  post and people are still denying it yeah well i i just like to shout out his website it's conspiracy
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:51.040]  to riot dot com conspiracy to riot dot com that's the name of the song and uh you can go and see
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:54.880]  it's actually by his friend who's arrested there and you can read all about it maybe you might
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:36:59.520]  want to play it maybe during one of the intros or ending all right conspiracy to riot dot com
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:03.840]  anything else uh that's it and i just like thank you so much for everything you've done all your
[2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:08.080]  friend and bob chatman excellent guest stay tuned for that yeah he's coming up we'll have open
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:15.440]  phones with him as well uh let's go ahead and uh talk to john and illinois go ahead john
[2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:22.720]  hello yes sir hey how's it going there alex good this is the first time i've been able to get
[2:37:22.720 --> 2:37:27.280]  through i've probably a trillion times but uh first time i've ever been able to get through
[2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:31.200]  and i'm glad to talk to you man well here you are and it's good to talk to you go ahead
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:38.160]  oh well you know i was going to discuss some of the stuff that uh tom from colorado was uh
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:47.200]  talking about uh obama and the uh whole uh staged uh race riot uh what's your uh what's your opinion
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:54.320]  on that no i think uh obama is going to make everybody think about race more see multiculturalism
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:59.200]  is actually meant to make you be more aware of what color somebody is or what race somebody is
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:06.560]  and to make the quote minority groups make their identity about their race not about liberty or
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:14.400]  freedom and so it's to get you off track to to to to uh not discover liberty but never discover it
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:18.960]  and then it's also about making whites feel all guilty and weird so the mind controller is going
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:27.280]  to attach whatever agenda they want on uh to the multiculturalism and so it's it's just like
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:32.720]  global warming is oh you're guilty you did something bad as a human but you can pay a tax to fix it
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:38.080]  and see that also gives the globalist control but it also diverts the public away from all the real
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:43.040]  environmental problems like gmo foods that are killing us i mean they're giving us cancer it
[2:38:43.040 --> 2:38:48.640]  gives all mammals cancer fast i mean it kills you quick and we're all getting killed by it and
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:53.760]  you know the we need to stop it and you know and the plastic and that has the hormones in it
[2:38:53.760 --> 2:38:57.600]  and the cell phones are killing us and the fluoride's killing us and it's all admitted and
[2:38:57.600 --> 2:39:01.920]  they're not taking it out and i'm just warning people absolutely and you're doing a wonderful
[2:39:01.920 --> 2:39:06.880]  job and just a quick thing uh you know to all the haters out there that you know keep sending
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:12.240]  you messages and whatnot hey people take off your blinders and really listen to what this man is
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:18.880]  saying uh he doesn't participate in the whole bs left right paradigm uh they're all puppets and
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:24.400]  like you said you know since kennedy and probably even back beyond that i mean this this this nation
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:28.480]  how he was no angel but he really tried to be president you know whether he was doing good
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:33.760]  stuff or bad stuff a lot of it was good uh he was not playing ball with them and so they said bang
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:39.600]  you're dead yep yep yep well keep up hey reagan well thank you reagan wasn't doing everything
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:46.000]  he was told and they shot him and clearly he was really shot in the car go ahead yeah partly
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:52.480]  actually touched on that in his uh autobiography of uh george bush if i recall oh it's on record
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:56.320]  the hinkley's our personal friends with the bushes they met with him the night before
[2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:02.560]  they're about to let him out of prison mm-hmm how the mental ward totally staged absolutely
[2:40:02.560 --> 2:40:07.280]  keep up a good fight now haters out there y'all just need to listen to what this man is saying
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:11.440]  he knows and i appreciate your call but but but i want to make people understand something i don't
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:18.400]  gripe about people attacking me because i personally care i mean i really don't
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:24.880]  now if i get to know you and i and i consider you to be a friend when you talk about about me
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:31.760]  or lie about me then it's personal and i can't help it then i just absolutely hate you and do
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:38.560]  everything i can uh to get you out of my life but other than that people i don't know or are
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:49.600]  people that i see on the other side i don't care i literally don't care but it's the denial i mean
[2:40:49.600 --> 2:40:53.920]  the government admits they built fema camps they admit they're training police for gun confiscation
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:58.160]  they admit they're using the national guard to confiscate guns in several states they admit
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.560]  they're doing all this in youth brigades and all of it and the people go on the message board and
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:10.080]  say i'm lying or they build straw men they say you said out that george bush was going to suspend
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:17.200]  the election and you're a liar but they give no source contrary to that i said ladies and gentlemen
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:22.400]  we're already in martial law to a certain extent they're only going to incrementally turn the heat
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:29.040]  up and don't start thinking george bush is going to do this he is going to pass the power on and
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:32.880]  each president is going to incrementally turn the heat up that's what fabians do
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:40.800]  it's the incremental school of control the slow boil and i had all these big liberals up saying
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:45.440]  listen naomi wolf when bush leaves office and your your king barack obama's in there
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:49.840]  you watch he's going to follow every policy of george bush because it isn't a george bush
[2:41:49.840 --> 2:41:54.720]  policy it's a new world order policy she said well i hope you're wrong but i'll speak out of that's
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:42:04.080]  the case well we'll see now so i'm tired of having to defend things i didn't say or i didn't do
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:12.400]  the big fashionable thing out there on the web now is to edit my shows together where i'm bashing
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:18.480]  gay people or bashing blacks or bashing mexicans or and the public is so stupid that a lot of them
[2:42:18.480 --> 2:42:23.760]  actually even buy into it but that's okay i mean you're always going to have those that that
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:31.840]  that fall prey to that and i and i've got enemies that are so bought into the system whether they're
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:39.040]  paid or not to attack me that that that they're signed on until the end to try to discredit me
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:46.480]  i just put it in god's hands it's my job to expose what's going on and then i leave it at that
[2:42:46.480 --> 2:42:53.840]  you know i i put the info out and what people do with it is their problem
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:43:00.000]  this is australian tv a few years ago and i personally have gone out
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:05.440]  and found the public is about half as dumb as this piece i mean
[2:43:08.160 --> 2:43:10.960]  you see some of it in game about 90 percent of those we talked to
[2:43:10.960 --> 2:43:16.560]  who didn't understand basic terms now this australian tv from what i've experienced
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:24.080]  found particularly stupid people but but really the average american is closer to miss
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:30.000]  south carolina in their education and information about the world around them
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:35.760]  and basic definitions and terms of geography you name it then they are
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:42.720]  are say to somebody like myself i mean they're a lot closer on the spectrum
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  and that's a scary thing and that's what encourages the bankers to go crazy
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:53.360]  that's what encourages them to just keep doing what they're doing they keep testing
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:43:56.400]  they steal two trillion in front of you why not still three trillion more
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:00.960]  they openly keep it for bonuses and laugh at us nothing happens they go forward
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:05.360]  they're not going to stop and that's why they're now telling you on the news we will completely
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:10.000]  collapse in the road warrior they are sucking everything dry they hate this country they've
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  always wanted to bring it down and they're doing it financially this is economic genocide
[2:44:14.800 --> 2:44:23.600]  this is a economic 9-11 let's go ahead and let's go ahead and play this clip of americans
[2:44:23.600 --> 2:44:30.080]  and they show them a map and say where's iran and they put a flag on australia
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:38.720]  and let me tell you i talked to the public they're like that folks i mean they are deadly dangerous
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:43.840]  they can the the government could tell those zombies that we were al-qaeda and they tear us apart
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:50.400]  they can tell them anything they want they tell cops that protesters are terrorists so the cops are
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:54.640]  okay we gotta go set them up then we can't have terrorists out on the streets you know the cops
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:59.120]  aren't that dumb but they're they're they're not as dumb as people you're about to hear but they're
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:03.440]  close so let's go ahead and play part of the clip here it is look i know a lot of people give
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:08.480]  americans a bum rap for being stupid and knowing nothing about the world but the reality couldn't
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.840]  be further from the truth as i discovered on the streets here asking us locals about the very

[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:09.680]  we're gonna go talk to americans see how much they know about the world they run
[2:51:09.680 --> 2:51:14.720]  see it's been put out through the global corporate media including group of murdoch
[2:51:14.720 --> 2:51:21.600]  don't stuff overseas that were bad were stupid but you know it's true but that we run things
[2:51:21.600 --> 2:51:28.000]  so we take the blame for the wars we take the blame for the banking collapse that's what paulson
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:32.400]  said yesterday said we're sorry america did this and we're now gonna hand everything over to the
[2:51:32.400 --> 2:51:37.680]  new global authority which is the private banks that sit above the nation states and so if you
[2:51:37.680 --> 2:51:43.120]  have an anti-american sentiment why you're for the bankers taking over or if you're against
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:47.680]  george busher for the global carbon tax see how they set it up are you for george busher you
[2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:53.440]  for a global carbon tax oh i want a carbon tax i hate him are you against those evil americans
[2:51:53.440 --> 2:52:00.160]  yes well then you want world government absolutely i do that's how the psychology works it it's
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:06.240]  childlike games it's like if you have a child and you want to go to bed you can play mind games
[2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:11.120]  or the music you want to go to bed now or in 10 minutes they'll say in 10 minutes and then they've
[2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:19.040]  now acquiesced and won't argue they the same tricks are on the news the same tricks stop
[2:52:19.040 --> 2:52:25.680]  being idiots they're openly announcing world government everywhere and i'm getting email
[2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:31.440]  saying i'm making it up i mean well let's talk to phil in canada he disagrees goes to the head
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:41.360]  of the line go ahead phil hello alex hi you know i love you you are a island of sanity in a world of
[2:52:42.320 --> 2:52:47.920]  idiocy and i really really agree with virtually everything that you talk about are you calling
[2:52:47.920 --> 2:52:55.520]  on a skype phone uh no no well i can i can't hear but about half what you're saying you're calling
[2:52:55.520 --> 2:53:02.320]  a regular telephone yeah it's internet telephone well yeah that's that's yeah that's what i thought
[2:53:02.320 --> 2:53:06.160]  i hope it comes to okay you know it didn't come through too good but go ahead and tell me what
[2:53:06.160 --> 2:53:13.680]  you disagree with i disagree with our movement allowing these people who stole the world the
[2:53:13.680 --> 2:53:22.640]  words in new world order from republic and liberty and and and they are using it to put forward this
[2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:30.320]  global world government by criminals that is this tori wig cabal our forefathers actually
[2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:36.400]  overcame years and years ago you know everybody wants uh you know a new house a new car a new tv
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:44.640]  a new boat we are parroting their propaganda this is a not so new world order oh i agree but i mean
[2:53:44.640 --> 2:53:49.520]  they are setting up a new world empire and that's what new world order means is they're saying we
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:56.800]  are setting up a global tyranny uh to wage war against free humanity and to carry out eugenics
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:54:03.840]  policies and so that's be with you 100 you know but i'm saying that by us complaining about a new
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:09.200]  world order it sounds like we're the anarchists we're the luddates you know and in fact our
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:14.640]  forefathers were the luddates and they were they definitely did fear this concentration of power
[2:54:14.640 --> 2:54:20.480]  in the hands of noble elites and their and their and their their their elite we got no i hear you
[2:54:20.480 --> 2:54:25.520]  i gotta let you go as your phone's cutting out but what they really feared was the elites conning
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:32.800]  the howling mob to go rob the middle class and so the controlled corporate media always badmouts the
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:37.440]  evil founding fathers and then you know exaggerates what they did or makes them look bad and says they
[2:54:37.440 --> 2:54:43.600]  were rich old white men no they were middle class people who wanted to be able to set up their own
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:48.480]  little private empires and they had to get the bigger empire off their back to do that that's
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:54.080]  human nature and because they understood that they openly said that they said we're bad but we
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:59.200]  want to give our children a better future and so we'll have a separation of powers to tie the hands
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:07.520]  of evil men like us they understood human nature they were amazing people and um they led the way
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:14.160]  the american system tarply was saying the american system was uh hamilton it was not hamilton the
[2:55:14.160 --> 2:55:21.040]  american system was elie whitney in the cotton gin and then manufacturing mass manufacturing
[2:55:21.040 --> 2:55:28.480]  before every gun was different was handmade before every buggy was handmade or every uh
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:33.840]  bit that went in the horse's mouth was handcrafted and different uh it was mass production of the
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:38.480]  factory it was elie whitney so we literally invented it all we'll be right back now we're
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:44.160]  a bunch of idiots hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:48.160]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent
[2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:52.480]  and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:57.120]  bread you'll never have to go to the super go and beg for femen to take care of your family in any
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:01.760]  emergency if you simply prepare our elective representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:06.320]  of a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:11.280]  email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:16.160]  now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will
[2:56:16.160 --> 2:56:21.280]  slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:26.480]  many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:32.160]  every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[2:56:32.160 --> 2:56:36.640]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are
[2:56:36.640 --> 2:56:41.120]  refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:45.840]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and
[2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:50.400]  be ready everything is zeroing it on food one third of americans have to choose between buying
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:55.760]  food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[2:56:55.760 --> 2:56:59.600]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by

[2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:46.400]  because they're predatory they have the slave systems they have the slave camps they have the
[2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:52.080]  factory deals they have the inside deal the inside track they are meant to deindustrialize

[2:59:42.720 --> 2:59:48.320]  that's they've already stolen that two trillion they won't even say where it went uh bonner demands

[3:00:04.080 --> 3:00:10.800]  issued blacked out pages and then treasury secretary and fed chairman get up on tv and
[3:00:10.800 --> 3:00:16.960]  say we've given you total transparency the taxpayers are protected just and then green

[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:41.680]  that oh bush is expanding patriot too before he leaves non legislatively and it says that police
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:47.280]  can be federalized and spy on anyone for even non political reasons are non criminal reasons
[3:00:47.280 --> 3:00:53.040]  just total tyranny which is what obama wants the million man domestic spy force and it said
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:59.920]  obama can't reverse it if bush does it total lie obama could instantly reverse it but see
[3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:05.360]  they're already telling you all obama can't change what bush did knowing the public doesn't even know

[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:34.320]  president they're not co-equal that's why legislatures used to send the senators because the founders knew
[3:01:34.320 --> 3:01:38.560]  you had to have the real power in the legislature because it had more checks and balances
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:46.560]  but now that new york times comes out and tells you hey uh there's nothing you can do uh and uh
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:51.520]  puts out this disinformation that there's no oversight it's like alan greenspan says there's no

[3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:32.720]  well i think the change of pace uh by the secretary of the treasury they've been at it for 15 months
[3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:37.200]  and they still don't know where they're going everything they've tried has been unsuccessful
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:41.760]  and as you pointed out uh they all their sweetheart deals that they've been giving to
[3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:47.280]  their other aluminous friends uh uh they won't even tell you who they're giving the money to
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:55.520]  which is the height of arrogance and um the situation in the market uh market was down
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:02.000]  300 announcement came out president's gonna speak market goes down to even and any speaks
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:09.120]  to the market goes back up 250 and now it's come back down again and so every time the plunge
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:15.760]  protection team runs the market up uh institutions the public committed sell so the market's not
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:21.440]  going anywhere and eventually it's going to go lower uh gold just rallied 12 dollars actually
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:28.480]  about uh about 18 dollars and then now it's going on its way back to even again it's like a circus
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:35.040]  all of this says total manipulation total and it's not only these markets it's all over the world
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:40.320]  and uh you know you get this meeting coming up in a couple of days and what are they gonna do
[3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:47.440]  they're gonna tell uh the world that uh they're gonna print and money and credit uh every country
[3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:56.640]  is as fast as humanly possible and that um uh they're going to as well uh all bring their
[3:04:56.640 --> 3:05:02.480]  interest rates to zero and uh that'll probably buy them about two years and then they'll get
[3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:10.000]  into the japanese syndrome and they'll all go down together but not before the elites have
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:15.360]  tried to position themselves in a safe position and set up a police state as a rearguard action
[3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:21.040]  against us as they leave scorched earth so we're too busy trying to feed ourselves to ever go after
[3:05:21.040 --> 3:05:27.040]  them and that's why it's so important everybody should have food a filter and weapons at home
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:32.720]  it's a primary objective of every one of them out there all right let's come in with bob chatman
[3:05:32.720 --> 3:05:38.720]  of internationalforecaster.com for the full am and fm uh satellite shortwave audience in t-minus

[3:06:02.720 --> 3:06:09.680]  trends research institute uh he's just like bob his predictions of about 95 accuracy when cnn wants
[3:06:09.680 --> 3:06:16.720]  to know about top trends we ask uh jerald salente but but the problem is that they wouldn't have him
[3:06:16.720 --> 3:06:22.400]  on years ago when he was saying this now they want him on to fully panic people and now they want to
[3:06:22.400 --> 3:06:27.280]  route things so we've got bob chatman on with us our financial expert who joins us once a week
[3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:34.000]  to go over what's happening with the markets right now bob first off they're telling us breton woods
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:39.840]  to uh they're openly announcing that they want a quote new world order run by the banks where they
[3:06:39.840 --> 3:06:44.560]  set commodity prices where they set and and globally rig stock markets publicly what they're
[3:06:44.560 --> 3:06:49.520]  already doing behind the scenes uh where they set the currencies where they have a global
[3:06:49.520 --> 3:06:56.880]  devaluation of the currencies and interest rates to zero uh and where the private group of banks
[3:06:56.880 --> 3:07:02.160]  runs and controls other banks and institutions of the world we will pay carbon taxes to them
[3:07:02.160 --> 3:07:08.160]  we will pay money transfer taxes to them this is it um they say out of this meeting this weekend
[3:07:08.160 --> 3:07:12.320]  they'll have a string of others over the next year they're going to use the crisis to force us
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:16.800]  onto the system break down what we're going to see this weekend and what you think they'll be able
[3:07:16.800 --> 3:07:24.000]  to set up and then how you see that unfolding uh salente uh he says the same thing that you're
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:32.480]  saying he says by 2012 it will be war in the streets uh literally mad max beyond thunderdome
[3:07:33.280 --> 3:07:38.240]  and he's saying that the bankers did it basically by design he says we've had a bloodless coup with
[3:07:38.240 --> 3:07:44.240]  wall street taking over the us and looting and and and they're letting him say this on mainstream tv
[3:07:46.960 --> 3:07:52.960]  bob chevon they like him wasn't they like me because they won't invite me on mainstream tv they
[3:07:52.960 --> 3:07:59.840]  told me i was a street fighter last time and uh and that's probably very true i did grow up on
[3:07:59.840 --> 3:08:05.680]  the streets and i was a street fighter but uh that was a long time ago uh out of the meeting
[3:08:05.680 --> 3:08:10.320]  what they're going to get is zero interest rates everybody's going to do that all the central banks
[3:08:11.040 --> 3:08:15.920]  and they will print money and credit until the cows come home and uh so what are we going to have
[3:08:15.920 --> 3:08:21.280]  we're going to have hyperinflation to offset the underlying deflation that we're in we're having
[3:08:21.280 --> 3:08:27.440]  a small hiatus now for three or three four months where inflation will back off a little bit don't
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:33.360]  be fooled out there because it's coming back with a vengeance the monetization of these trillions
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:39.920]  of dollars that are being created and so that's where we're headed uh i think as time goes on and
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:47.920]  the market goes lower which i believe it will that what we will have is uh continued pressure
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:53.840]  on the working group and financial markets and the other name for that plunge protection team
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:09:01.680]  and uh i think they're going to continue to lose power uh there if their their abilities
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:08.720]  are going to wane and uh and the not only in the stock market but also in other markets as well
[3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:17.200]  and uh as this unfolds i think that the stock market will go lower the dollar will go lower
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:24.080]  and against other currencies and all currencies will go lower against gold and gold will finally
[3:09:24.080 --> 3:09:31.680]  over the next year break loose and get on its own and go to the level where it reasonably should be
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:37.040]  uh by the way bob a lot of other big mention historical basis say that again no i'm sorry
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:41.280]  interrupt a lot of mainline analysts are saying what you're saying they're saying that big financial
[3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:47.280]  institutions by cutting off liquidity by killing the markets are using us as a time to consolidate
[3:09:47.840 --> 3:09:53.200]  this this contraction in main street and the industrial base the real economy but that as
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:58.960]  soon as that is over as bad as all the closings and shutdowns and layoffs are the worst is yet to come
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:06.880]  in the next year leading into 2012 into three years as the hyperinflation compounds uh on top
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:13.680]  of the depression we see in the real economy and so would you say that that is the unknown economic
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:20.640]  land that we've never entered of hyper stag inflation yes it's going to be worse than 1930s
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:27.600]  for a number of reasons it's like a spinning top and the top gets goes faster and faster and all of
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:32.640]  a sudden it flips out and goes into orbit you don't see it anymore because the system collapses
[3:10:33.200 --> 3:10:39.040]  and that's what we're faced with yes we had uh abuse of credit during the 1920s but nothing
[3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:45.920]  like you see today i mean there were no credit cards just as an example and we had relative
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:52.400]  law and order in those days there were not law large amounts of criminals like the the minions
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:11:00.160]  of people who are incarcerated in america today and uh and so the underlying and we were we were
[3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:07.120]  uh a creditor nation people owed us money and we had backing on our currency of gold uh which
[3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:13.440]  we don't have today so that all these factors and many others you put them together and um as
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:21.040]  they say in england it looks like a dog's breakfast from here to 12 uh 2012 and uh i agree things are
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:25.760]  going to get nasty i keep on telling people over and over again get out of debt the credit card
[3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:34.000]  debt the revolving debt you know get the things and you need uh the food uh the filter the weapons
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:40.720]  you're going to need them bob what about them there what about what about this uh g20 meeting uh
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:48.320]  in dc this weekend openly announcing uh baron roth child was in the ua e national paper saying
[3:11:48.320 --> 3:11:54.640]  we're setting up world government uh this is the new world order meanwhile rush limbaugh says the
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:12:00.000]  roth childs don't exist that's a quote to his idiot fake conservative audience that's been
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:04.560]  lulled to sleep we're the real conservatives by the way if you didn't know that if you're a rush
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:10.320]  limbaugh minion uh i mean this is going to be a rude awakening for them who keep living in denial
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:17.680]  but that's part two what do you see coming up this weekend uh well we've we've really touched on the
[3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:25.840]  two main points uh there'll be a number of things put forward uh on uh on uh transparency uh which
[3:12:25.840 --> 3:12:34.960]  is uh just a sub-diffuse and they'll talk about global warming and uh talk about china uh spending
[3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:40.480]  four hundred and sixty billion dollars on infrastructure and uh you know the chinese
[3:12:40.480 --> 3:12:47.280]  just spent a lot of time over the last year uh this their currency had strengthened and their
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:52.080]  inflation dropped from about eight percent to about four point two percent and you know they
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:57.360]  were kind of getting it together although unemployment was rising because uh economic
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:02.400]  growth had dropped from eleven eleven a half percent down to about nine and a half and they're
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:08.160]  projecting nine percent this coming year although i see credit sweeps is projecting seven point two
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:13.760]  percent and i think credit sweeps is right and anything under eight percent means riots all
[3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:19.520]  kinds of real problems in china and they've already got them they already have plenty of uh
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:27.440]  of uh uh demonstrations what they've got is chinese cops raping little girls being caught on tape
[3:13:27.440 --> 3:13:31.440]  they burn whole cities you just don't hear about it in our news the chinese people
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:36.560]  you want to call the american spirit which is arrogant the human spirit they are taking on
[3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:41.520]  the police and the military and defeating them all across the country and even where they quote
[3:13:41.520 --> 3:13:48.240]  good economy uh the people are sick of being slaves the chinese people in beijing climb up on
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:53.680]  lamp poles and pull down surveillance cameras they will not allow it and and and and that's
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:59.840]  what's so shameful as americans think we're so free even in communist china they you know they
[3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:05.600]  want the liberty everybody wants liberty and freedom and when you have
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:12.960]  uh essentially a mercantilist system uh that's operating in the world today uh this is the
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:20.400]  old british system that alexander hamilton wanted to hang on americans uh this is the system uh
[3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:27.440]  which allows open and free trade and the people make all the money are the transnational elitist
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:35.120]  corporations and then they take that money to extend into control and uh that's what we've got
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:41.200]  today and it's got to be reversed in order from for western europe and america and many other
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:48.400]  parts of the world to survive we can't have free trade because there's no level playing field
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:53.760]  i mean every time they have free trade people start to value in their currencies well that's
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:58.640]  the biggest issue that i always make yeah so they can make the goods cheaper there and undercut you
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:03.200]  that that the globalists admit in their own handbooks u n club of rome that the global
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:08.320]  warnings all fake its attacks to regulate and control our everyday lives that's what they
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:14.000]  chose carbon dioxide it's basically output and all manufacturing all commerce you know transportation
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:21.120]  you name it it's a total control but i mean let's just say it's real carbon dioxide's deadly how is
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:32.640]  is not letting us have basically any output here and taxing it going to empower uh you know the
[3:15:32.640 --> 3:15:38.240]  people or stop global warming when it will just make all the industry that hasn't left that 20
[3:15:38.240 --> 3:15:43.280]  percent go to india and china and mexico and bangledore i mean and all the studies show
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:49.120]  these policies will boost greenhouse gases because the industry will go to nations that
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:54.080]  have no controls and the u n has no intention of making those countries do it this is asinine
[3:15:55.520 --> 3:16:00.400]  it just shows you the fallacy of the whole thing it just shows you what a big lie it isn't what a
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:08.560]  big scam it is it's just like terrorism i mean where is it it doesn't exist except in small
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:14.240]  pockets here and there the point is it was the scam to get it going i would have never dreamed
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:20.080]  that would have been able to get away with it but they have and of course the extension of that
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:26.400]  is this quote financial meeting that they're having it for the group of 20 and uh as you said earlier
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:32.880]  it'll be stretched over a year or two before uh they are attempting to get implemented what they want
[3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:38.160]  in the meantime as we've discussed before in the program i think there's a good chance
[3:16:38.160 --> 3:16:45.600]  that they're going to have another war a bigger one and paul described that last week what do you
[3:16:45.600 --> 3:16:50.960]  think the big surprise is the 21st or 22nd i want to be clear we're already being blamed for that
[3:16:50.960 --> 3:16:56.480]  we're making a prediction no we're talking about biden talking about pal talking about merkel
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:17:04.160]  buroso brown uh the secretary of state rice we're not saying it they're saying it's going to happen
[3:17:04.160 --> 3:17:09.360]  if it doesn't happen that's just them terrorizing us but we have to report on them saying this what
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:17.120]  is it bob well it could very well be an invasion of another country which would beat russia or force
[3:17:17.120 --> 3:17:21.600]  russia into a confrontation with the united states because russia's the ones that are the one that
[3:17:21.600 --> 3:17:25.520]  they're after all we got so much to cover for everybody on the aim and fm all our great affiliates
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:29.680]  be sure and support the sponsors coming up for everybody else i'm going to talk to bob on the
[3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:34.640]  web and at prison planet dot tv during this break to take some phone calls because i don't
[3:17:34.640 --> 3:17:40.320]  want to waste any time here today and the time we have left info wars dot com's the website
[3:17:41.680 --> 3:17:51.280]  okay uh let's uh go ahead and go to i guess turbos up next john yep that's correct
[3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:55.200]  turbo in california you're on the air with alex jones and bob Chapman of the international
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:18:03.360]  forecaster dot com hey alex uh first let me say uh that i am a member a subscriber of
[3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:11.200]  prison planet tv and that's wonderful thank you for making the show possible well sir
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:19.920]  now uh my original reason for calling up i've been on hold for like 45 minutes i understand
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:27.200]  okay it was for uh to ask you a two-part question but after hearing mr chapman there i gotta tell
[3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:34.640]  mr chapman that yeah okay here in california the people in prison that are called criminals over
[3:18:34.640 --> 3:18:39.680]  60 percent of them are there for nonviolent drug offenses not but i think his point is
[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:44.960]  is that it's a college of crime they have created a larger more violent criminal culture the
[3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:50.480]  statistics are what three four times depending on the crime or region what we had in the 30s
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:56.560]  and he's saying people were 90 percent agrarian instead of 90 percent urban i mean you know in
[3:18:56.560 --> 3:19:02.400]  shorthand he was just saying that people aren't as well behaved as they were they're more spoiled
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:08.400]  they're not self-sufficient uh and and and and because they criminalized drugs and things it
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:18.400]  created other uh uh corollary crime syndicates or or or or or energy centers to be colleges of
[3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:24.800]  crime bob you agree with that statement absolutely i i do and he's right too uh you know my former
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:32.080]  son-in-law uh what uh what had a master's and was studying uh phd in criminology and i've read
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:37.280]  the books and he's absolutely right well sir now let me say that now this goes back to why
[3:19:37.280 --> 3:19:46.560]  i originally called you alex because i put a lot of stock in your opinions now uh and i don't know
[3:19:46.560 --> 3:19:52.720]  if you coined this phrase but you've certainly used it the bush cheney crime cartel the war
[3:19:52.720 --> 3:20:04.160]  profit caring corporations now sir they are the criminals that have us americans uh like in a
[3:20:04.160 --> 3:20:12.480]  stranglehold of evil with their depleted iranian munitions over four million innocent iraqi people
[3:20:13.440 --> 3:20:19.040]  dead and dying because of the well that's right it's three million dead from machine gun bullets
[3:20:19.040 --> 3:20:25.600]  cholera starvation bombs but there are but but but i was about to say millions more their cancer
[3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:30.800]  rate in the regions where it was used is five times normal and the birth defects are even higher
[3:20:30.800 --> 3:20:35.120]  than that and all these arrogant americans who think oh good they're brown people kill them
[3:20:35.120 --> 3:20:40.800]  the elite doesn't care about you either right sir in fact i talked to a man from new york
[3:20:40.800 --> 3:20:47.920]  city the other day and he says oh the war is good because it shows how strong america is
[3:20:47.920 --> 3:20:53.680]  and i said sir what what the war shows is the destruction of the united states of america
[3:20:53.680 --> 3:20:59.200]  by the filthy corporation and it shows that the american people you know i played that clip earlier
[3:20:59.200 --> 3:21:04.320]  of americans on the street corner going bomb this city bomb that country bomb france bomb
[3:21:04.320 --> 3:21:11.200]  bomb it's like a petty demonic uh petty ego power to imagine killing people that makes them
[3:21:11.200 --> 3:21:18.960]  in their dim little minds feel some glint of activity or life it's just they're dull goblin
[3:21:18.960 --> 3:21:22.960]  like creatures but there are a lot of good people left in the country that's why we have to fight
[3:21:22.960 --> 3:21:26.960]  the evil so that we can protect ourselves and protect others and not let the globalists
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:32.080]  use the u.s as an engine of evil but i need to see the reason it was 45 minutes is because the
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:36.720]  callers are on three or four minutes a piece we have guests we have ads we run out of time
[3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:41.360]  anything else what was your question for me and i say one more thing before i go yeah go ahead
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:48.480]  okay i'll say that okay i i i was in prison for seven years and eight months hold on i'm
[3:21:48.480 --> 3:21:55.920]  gonna go back to the full audience here we go okay turbo in california wants to make a comment
[3:21:55.920 --> 3:22:03.360]  uh with bob Chapman go ahead turbo you're on the air okay sir sir i was in prison here in california
[3:22:03.360 --> 3:22:10.800]  for seven years and eight months i lost my land i lost my right to own a firearm i don't consider
[3:22:10.800 --> 3:22:18.640]  myself to be a criminal you know who the criminals are the criminals are all the way from the white
[3:22:18.640 --> 3:22:26.080]  house to their whore house to their court house to their jail house into their nut house sir
[3:22:26.080 --> 3:22:32.880]  i am not a criminal i am not a criminal i never hurt anybody well you know with dna sure sure
[3:22:32.880 --> 3:22:38.640]  with the dna they found on average more than 30 of people were framed and i appreciate your call
[3:22:38.640 --> 3:22:43.200]  bob you know i'm not bashing police individually but there's no doubt they're directive you know
[3:22:43.200 --> 3:22:48.720]  who commands them is bad uh we just in denver found out and i you know i did see the police act
[3:22:48.720 --> 3:22:53.600]  better than anywhere else but in the few times they arrested hundreds of protesters the police
[3:22:53.600 --> 3:22:59.920]  went in and attacked other cops under orders but the cops being attacked didn't know they were other
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:06.640]  cops and it came out because cops with a whistle but this happens everywhere and so how do i say
[3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:12.480]  oh yes officers i trust you so much everywhere i go at demonstrations you attack cops to blame
[3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:17.840]  and on me to attack the first amendment and you know uh they caught more sheriffs two or three of
[3:23:17.840 --> 3:23:23.840]  them the last month in texas bringing in drugs uh they caught the houston crime lab framing 4000
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:28.880]  plus people i mean from the top they were ordering them to frame and i see that everywhere across the
[3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:34.720]  country and that's called tyranny bob Chapman i mean what do you do when you know a large percentage
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:40.320]  of your forces the police forces out there are are are criminal from the top down i mean what do
[3:23:40.320 --> 3:23:46.480]  you do with a society like that mom well at the moment you can't do anything but i think what's
[3:23:46.480 --> 3:23:52.320]  going to happen is they will extend their criminal activities and the good ones won't
[3:23:52.320 --> 3:24:00.480]  participate uh they'll quit and uh and they will they the bad ones will go and lead with whomever
[3:24:01.120 --> 3:24:09.440]  uh the military is that accompanies them and uh they will become the jack booted ss
[3:24:09.440 --> 3:24:15.680]  uh that is going to try to lure it over us and that's about the time then we're gonna have to act to
[3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:23.760]  stop them by the way they announced in the and and the governor didn't say this um the the proposal
[3:24:23.760 --> 3:24:30.880]  is checkpoints to check insurance driver's license they're gonna arrest and ticket citizens when they
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:34.960]  when they do pull over an illegal alien they generally let them go or they get a $50 fine
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:38.480]  so they throw the book at citizens but not at the illegal aliens and that's on record
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:43.760]  but they sell it that it's to stop the illegal aliens all over the country but also right here
[3:24:43.760 --> 3:24:49.920]  in texas warrantless mass checkpoints i mean that's like third world dictatorships right there bob
[3:24:50.720 --> 3:24:57.120]  it certainly is that in fact i don't i don't think in in the soviet countries they even went that far
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:05.440]  i mean they had their stasi and kgb and so on but uh checkpoints only usually at borders
[3:25:05.440 --> 3:25:10.880]  and you know they usually will minefields and barbed wire and other things to keep people from
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:16.160]  breaking out of their prison so to speak that's right if we had a real border it would have a
[3:25:16.160 --> 3:25:24.000]  minefield on it yes that that's a good point but uh the influx that is coming in over our borders
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:30.160]  is slowing because there there is any jobs to be filled and and the main reason people leave other
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:36.160]  countries is to make a better living and so that's naturally going to slow down but um oh yeah i don't
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:40.160]  blame the people that want to come here the point is the globalists want them here to drive down wages
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:46.160]  so and also so there won't be a rebellion in mexico that could bring in liberty so see any
[3:25:46.160 --> 3:25:50.160]  globalist policy is going to be bad for the average person hence i'm against it
[3:25:52.160 --> 3:25:58.160]  so i couldn't agree with you more in fact let me just show the viewers they won't believe me
[3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:04.480]  um oh i had it here in my stack let me just show the viewers out there that are watching on
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:09.360]  prisonplanet.tv uh well i'll find it during the next break uh it was in the houston chronicle
[3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:13.120]  it just said they're going to shut down roads you may have to wait for hours everyone will be
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:16.480]  checked their papers will be checked i mean is that land of the free home of the brave bob
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:22.000]  hardly uh that is a police state there's no question let's talk to bob in california you're
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:31.440]  on there with bob Chapman go ahead bob hello hi how you doing good hey um you guys were talking
[3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:37.600]  about the police and that was one of the things i was uh wanted to talk to you about more towards
[3:26:37.600 --> 3:26:47.360]  alex i think our police and our military are going to be needed for our own support and i think
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:55.200]  criticism as you said the majority of them are corrupt now what i said is the attack pattern
[3:26:55.200 --> 3:27:02.160]  the setup the commanders the government is bad and so they're giving them unlawful illegal orders
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:07.760]  and setting the precedent to violate the constitution and will have rights and to bring in a tyranny
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:17.040]  see that there is a minority in there and it's a minority with the um trilateralist and the new
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:23.360]  one world government people well that minority is in the command positions we're going to skip
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:27.120]  this uh break again on the internet we'll keep talking about this with our guests and i'll
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:34.400]  play a clip when we come back stay with me we're on the march the empire is on the run
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:40.320]  sir what i'm saying is the command structure the policy of the government it's like every
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:46.000]  german soldier wasn't bad but their commanders were bad their government was run by bad people
[3:27:46.800 --> 3:27:52.960]  okay and so they say support the policy of us taking blood without a warrant at checkpoint uh
[3:27:52.960 --> 3:27:58.560]  you know support us having warrantless checkpoints of everybody support us having your children in
[3:27:58.560 --> 3:28:03.680]  school be taught to tattle tail on you i mean that they do that in austin i have their own police
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:10.320]  training videos for the kids it's in my film uh the road to tyranny i mean the police produced it
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:17.040]  that's not good that's not our system we know that's bad that's what we supposedly fought before
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:23.920]  so i'm not saying the average cop out there writing tickets or you know responding to fires
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:30.160]  or bank robberies is a bad person bob shabin can you explain this to him well i think you've
[3:28:30.160 --> 3:28:35.280]  explained it pretty well that there is a core of people at the top who are taking orders from
[3:28:35.280 --> 3:28:40.320]  washington and in part because they're partially funded very often and of course they like the
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:45.280]  money coming back to them as well from the drug bust that they get involved in and that allows
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:51.840]  them to pay the employees more money and allows them to easily fund their operationers or expand
[3:28:51.840 --> 3:29:00.160]  them make little kingdoms out of them um the police uh are in between uh they follow orders that they
[3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:07.280]  lose their job and there will come a time when there are police people who will say no i'm not
[3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:12.720]  going to do that it's in an unlawful order and i'm going home and you can find somebody else to do
[3:29:12.720 --> 3:29:18.320]  this job um i don't think the majority will do that but they will be police who will do that
[3:29:18.320 --> 3:29:24.400]  that who have a conscience well we know that's been happening over money so but we know they've
[3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:30.400]  been doing but then you're left with all the the bad guys that's true but you know they stand a
[3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:39.280]  tremendous risk here they are in a in a country of over 300 million people uh that that this
[3:29:39.280 --> 3:29:45.840]  has 450 million weapons i mean what can these police be thinking of just because they wear
[3:29:45.840 --> 3:29:51.040]  black uniforms and they've got weapons does not mean that they're going to win anything yeah i mean
[3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:56.800]  we we we're as well trained as they are many many of us went through the military many of us have
[3:29:56.800 --> 3:30:02.080]  killed people and many of us know how to handle weapons and if they think they're going to be
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:06.960]  effective in doing what they're doing they're crazy they're all going to get wiped out and they
[3:30:06.960 --> 3:30:12.000]  best start listening to us because we don't want them to get wiped out that's right i want them to
[3:30:12.000 --> 3:30:16.720]  be there to help us that's right we're not the ones that just stole five trillion dollars and
[3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:22.560]  won't say we're two trillion went that's in bloomberg and ap we're not the ones that did all of this
[3:30:22.560 --> 3:30:28.640]  we're not the bad guys turbo i appreciate your call hey uh john i meant to tell you come in with

[3:31:03.440 --> 3:31:09.120]  that's the one that had the timecode cut out in it it was the the first martial law clip
[3:31:09.120 --> 3:31:14.400]  i sent you with the intro of the film that's the only way to receive oh i i guess the iam didn't
[3:31:14.400 --> 3:31:17.680]  send you the other one well say lobby i'll play it at the end of the show i wanted to play the
[3:31:17.680 --> 3:31:22.880]  intro to martial law 911 rise of the police state where we broke down what was happening in the
[3:31:22.880 --> 3:31:35.360]  nation but bob shatman here it is in the mainstream media in bloomberg in the new york times
[3:31:42.640 --> 3:31:44.000]  and we have the bankers
[3:31:47.760 --> 3:31:49.520]  just openly coming out
[3:31:49.520 --> 3:32:04.480]  and saying we can do whatever we want whenever we want however we want and we are just going to
[3:32:04.480 --> 3:32:09.920]  take the money and use it for bonuses and we are going to buy healthy financial institutions
[3:32:09.920 --> 3:32:14.400]  and sports teams and water districts and they even tell the new york times that and laugh
[3:32:14.400 --> 3:32:22.240]  laugh um these are professional serious crooks they're focused why the added insult is it part
[3:32:22.240 --> 3:32:26.400]  of urinating on us like a bigger dog does with smaller dog to kind of set a precedent
[3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:33.760]  they're in the open uh they've been forced into the open by by people like yourself
[3:32:34.640 --> 3:32:40.480]  and others who have programs which are similar right is like myself and they think well the
[3:32:40.480 --> 3:32:45.440]  public knows it now they're going to hear it if they haven't heard it already and so let's do
[3:32:45.440 --> 3:32:51.200]  what we're going to do we got the power we control this vast military system we control the source
[3:32:51.200 --> 3:32:57.360]  of money we can really do anything we want so you know we don't care what these people think
[3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:04.640]  anymore i mean we have elections we control all the candidates with minor exception and they buy in
[3:33:04.640 --> 3:33:12.720]  every single election and and so they do what they want and it it's just arrogance and uh we you
[3:33:12.720 --> 3:33:20.000]  know they've opened the window of opportunity and they know that and so what we must do is we must
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:26.720]  mate and wait for them to cross the rubicon so to speak for them to make a fatal mistake
[3:33:26.720 --> 3:33:32.080]  and i think a fatal mistake would be insurrection in the united states the minute that starts
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:38.080]  believe me they are at risk there are thousands and thousands of people out there who know who
[3:33:38.080 --> 3:33:41.840]  they are and if they think they're going to escape this thing they're crazy
[3:33:44.560 --> 3:33:49.120]  bob i agree i mean they would try it with limbaugh their main mouthpiece the fake
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:53.600]  conservative to neutralize their main enemy real conservatives who know the bill of rights
[3:33:53.600 --> 3:33:58.560]  constitution he would say there's no such thing as a cfr no such thing as a boulderberg
[3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:03.920]  no such thing as a trilateral commission no such thing uh as a new world order
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:10.080]  no such thing as a Rothschild and now it's just everywhere and they go yeah we're going to have
[3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:14.000]  a world government run by private banks and yeah we're taking the money and not telling you where
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:17.200]  it went and yeah there's trillions missing from the pentagon we're not going to tell them and
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:21.680]  they tell congress we're not telling you and if you don't pass the bailout martial law
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:26.640]  so you're right the gauntlet is thrown down because they have to act normal
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:31.760]  so their bureaucrats and enforcers will follow the orders it's that you know like acting like
[3:34:31.760 --> 3:34:36.400]  your normal stealing somebody's tv set as you walk out of their apartment and you know not
[3:34:36.400 --> 3:34:40.160]  running with the tv set so people would think you're acting suspicious like yeah i'm here with
[3:34:40.160 --> 3:34:48.800]  the tv set big deal and so it's kind of like i mean i mean really they are i mean but i mean who
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:53.360]  would still it's amazing to watch them just steal all the money right in front of us and say they're
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:35:00.160]  stealing it and tell congress credible i mean with trillions of dollars i mean we we get people in
[3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:09.600]  prison and rightly so who committed an armed robbery and got 157 dollars maybe they had a
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:15.200]  night maybe they had a gun and they're doing five or ten years in jail and these people
[3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:21.520]  don't take 157 dollars they don't use a weapon although the position is a weapon
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:29.760]  they just go out and steal trillions it it's beyond imagination crime is now become along
[3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:35.680]  with lying socially and politically acceptable yeah the public was trained that it's cute that
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:41.120]  clinton lied and cute that bush lies and no it's not cute folks because then society breaks down
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:45.520]  and we become a third world country when confidence is lost you know america is not perfect but we
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:50.560]  were the most upright we were the most trustworthy in business until about 50 years ago and that's
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:55.920]  why business thrived here and the main reason was if you cheated somebody in business they would
[3:35:55.920 --> 3:36:02.560]  normally come shoot you i mean you know i going back to the family animals i mean i i had great
[3:36:02.560 --> 3:36:06.880]  great great grandpas and people that you know you'd read about you know at the county seat in
[3:36:06.880 --> 3:36:11.520]  their history department would go shoot somebody or go beat into death you know with a with an
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:17.200]  axe if somebody cheated them so people were polite because because people would kill you if you
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:22.240]  cheated them and then now it's just like it's funny and cute that kill all those iraqi's good
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:27.360]  i'm glad they're dying good steal all the money steal the oil don't those people get that they're
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:34.000]  going to be screwed as well that's what i was just saying we have a long list and they are not going
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:38.960]  to escape and half of america will probably die in the process but they're going to get theirs
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:45.680]  and all their power is going to be gone it's just going to be like 1348 when the lombard system
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:49.200]  collapsed the same group of people ran in terror
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:56.480]  but they were grouped and came back again i want to go to some calls and put you on hold

[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:38.720]  this but i've been taking beta prostate for 15 years and i'm 73 years old and i functioned perfectly
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:45.920]  and i got a psa test about a month ago which deducted the the amas that you don't need at my age
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:53.360]  because you're gonna die anyway but the doctor told me that i had a condition which was uh
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:40:59.760]  uh my physical being was like a 25 year old man and beta prostate had a lot to do with that well
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:03.760]  yeah this is a huge company a huge sponsor for us i mean i'm not kidding i don't just take any
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:08.320]  vitamin company this is the big main line the stuff that's proven a lot of doctors prescribe
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:13.920]  uh super beta prostate or similar products i mean these are it's 30 herbs but the main one is
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:19.200]  is the saul palmetto very strong and for some reason with the stuff we eat the things we do by
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:24.640]  the age of 45 the prostate gets the size of a golf ball and associated with cancer
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:30.480]  uh erectile dysfunction the list goes on and on uh and yeah i only plug things i know are important
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:36.880]  for people and so that's why we push uh that so again newvitality.com thank you uh bob didn't
[3:41:36.880 --> 3:41:41.760]  know you were taking super beta prostate but millions of people do and this is uh real stuff
[3:41:41.760 --> 3:41:47.040]  here i want to take calls here for the last 15 minutes bob but um so much is happening
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:52.880]  and we see the market going up and down every day as confidence i mean i guess the elite
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:56.880]  don't care if confidence is being lost because they'll just blame that on their next puppet
[3:41:56.880 --> 3:42:02.240]  barack obama or where do you see this crisis and confidence going right now congress has this
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:09.200]  this nine percent still but obama he does have about a 50 percent confidence uh uh rate right
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:13.680]  now but but as soon as they realize he's a con man they will lose the confidence what's going to
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:19.840]  happen with that honeymoon uh it's good it's going to be devastating uh normally when somebody
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:26.880]  takes office it's uh it's uh ambulance and and usually the ratings uh will vary anywhere
[3:42:26.880 --> 3:42:34.080]  from usually 60 to 77 percent and and then the honeymoon's over and then they find out what
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:40.000]  they're going to do and things change sometimes and sometimes they don't sometimes they stay strong
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:44.720]  so to speak those ratings but i think they're going to find out that they're going to get
[3:42:44.720 --> 3:42:53.120]  relatively the same program from the neo that the neocons had uh from mr obama uh if not more
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:42:59.840]  socialistic in nature and uh their trust and confidence in government which is poor as it is
[3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:06.560]  will drop even more i'm looking at short term unemployment of 10 percent the coming year
[3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:11.040]  and that may be very conservative based on government figures uh the u six figure will
[3:43:11.040 --> 3:43:18.080]  probably be about uh 14.8 percent the long-term unemployment figure uh will probably be somewhere
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:23.120]  around 19 percent uh they're going to be a lot of unhappy people out there who didn't listen to us
[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:27.920]  in this program and program is like it and get themselves out of debt get their house in order
[3:43:27.920 --> 3:43:33.920]  get the things in that they need to protect their children feed them all of what we're telling you
[3:43:33.920 --> 3:43:40.160]  you know we don't we don't get paid to do this we do this because we want to help you and so
[3:43:40.160 --> 3:43:45.600]  do it we're telling you because you're going to need it bob i mean you're saying depression
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:50.160]  within two and a half three years uh basically guaranteed more and more mainline analysts are
[3:43:50.160 --> 3:43:55.920]  saying that the only debate is how bad is it going to get a lot of them are now saying like i said
[3:43:55.920 --> 3:44:01.600]  earlier road warrior type scenarios total breakdown uh i mean is it going to get that bad
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:10.080]  could be uh nobody knows that's possible and again that's why you've got to do those things
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:16.400]  you've got to be prepared and it's like an insurance policy if it doesn't happen uh you can sit back
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:20.960]  with a sigh of relief and say well this that and the other thing happened and should circuit it
[3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:26.080]  and we don't need this food now we can go and eat it all or we can go out and shoot rabbits with
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:32.800]  the with the rifles or we hope that we don't have a a hurricane so that we have to use this pump
[3:44:32.800 --> 3:44:40.960]  and and that's okay it's just buying an insurance policy well the good news is the patriots if all
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:45.040]  this comes down which it looks like it is the people that know about the new order we're going
[3:44:45.040 --> 3:44:50.320]  to be positioned better than general public but that's also going to make us targets for robbery
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:55.280]  and all sorts of stuff so we've also got to realize that but it's better to be prepared and face that
[3:44:55.280 --> 3:45:00.800]  than not be prepared and just lay back uh let's go to erin in washington you're on the air with bob
[3:45:00.800 --> 3:45:06.560]  chatman erin hey alex thanks for having me on the show thanks for calling hey listen i've got a
[3:45:06.560 --> 3:45:14.960]  couple things i wanted to bring up bob i've got a question for you um with the financial crisis
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:21.040]  that's going on do you expect them to for instance change the bankruptcy laws so when it really starts
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:25.200]  hitting the fan and people are losing their houses even more than they are now plus all
[3:45:25.200 --> 3:45:29.360]  their unsecured credit card debts and things like that and they have no way to pay because they just
[3:45:29.360 --> 3:45:35.040]  lost their job do you foresee them changing the bankruptcy laws to further implement slavery
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:43.040]  and bondage through debt could be it's hard to say uh they can do anything they want so
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:48.480]  it's possible and probable that they might do something like that well bob that's what concerns
[3:45:48.480 --> 3:45:53.760]  me is that if they'll steal five trillion and not even say we're two trillion went and say yeah we
[3:45:53.760 --> 3:45:59.280]  lied to you and and and we're going to take more what are they going to do next i mean every month
[3:45:59.280 --> 3:46:05.440]  that's some new horror and they're openly talking about uh in hearings last week and this week and
[3:46:05.440 --> 3:46:10.080]  now that we actually sent off the c-span and got them we have them for an upcoming film and they're
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:16.960]  talking about taxing pension funds and 401ks and taking over pension funds and then they'll pay you
[3:46:16.960 --> 3:46:23.520]  a social security check out of your own private fund and take part of it i mean i mean bob you
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:28.080]  know they just did that in argentina i mean the same crew do you think they could actually get away
[3:46:28.080 --> 3:46:34.080]  with that they can get away with anything they want should have revolution and they will push
[3:46:34.080 --> 3:46:39.440]  the people far enough and that will happen and maybe it's and it's possible that could happen
[3:46:39.440 --> 3:46:43.840]  and the cops are going to gun down old people that are mad their pension funds have been taken or
[3:46:43.840 --> 3:46:49.760]  or the old folks by the propaganda of we're taking it to keep it safe and now we're going to tax it
[3:46:49.760 --> 3:46:55.360]  and now we're going to take part of it and i will just go okay i mean i mean
[3:46:56.320 --> 3:47:03.280]  where do where does where where does the raping stop it stops when the first shot gets fired
[3:47:04.480 --> 3:47:08.880]  and then people will start thinking look i don't have anything left and i don't have anything to
[3:47:08.880 --> 3:47:15.120]  lose it's the rat in the corner you don't put them there and that's what they're going to do
[3:47:15.120 --> 3:47:20.720]  with their their you know they're not that smart we're just as smart as they are and they're going
[3:47:20.720 --> 3:47:24.640]  to make mistakes but they're arrogant bastards they know people are going to revolt they've
[3:47:24.640 --> 3:47:29.040]  been preparing they want to have a revolt bob but i agree with you i think i i think they're
[3:47:29.040 --> 3:47:34.560]  underestimating their power well i'll tell you one thing i'll be back in the middle of it
[3:47:35.360 --> 3:47:41.280]  even at my advanced age well the problem is most of the people that will get killed in a revolt
[3:47:41.280 --> 3:47:47.760]  are just going to be cops that don't even know what they're part of but i mean that's the final
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:52.240]  equation is that is that you know the real elites are living in switzerland
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:47:58.720]  you know there's no way that we can't find them believe me
[3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:07.360]  no i understand that and people are going to be disturbed and writing and and doing the same thing
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:15.440]  in every country in the world some countries will be let off easily uh their populations won't
[3:48:15.440 --> 3:48:22.480]  you know be as aggressive all right they won't be injured as much but in america it's a it's a
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:29.200]  wild west society and and they're different than other people and i can assure you uh it'll be the
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:36.160]  biggest there yep a lot of boss hogs are going to be in trouble but the mothership hogs i don't
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:40.480]  think will be unless we identify who they are but we want to stop all of this we're going to skip
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:48.400]  this break too okay does that answer your question erin as you know the funny thing is is i my opinion
[3:48:48.400 --> 3:48:55.440]  is that these people that are in charge i think that they want to at some point go completely out
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:49:02.560]  in the open and say guess what it's us you knew it was us all along and now we're telling it to you
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:08.720]  it's us and you know because if you don't do what we say we'll release digonian 12 the death virus
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:13.120]  oh yeah well because you think they really do that people are founded by lucifer you know these
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:17.600]  people are evil incarnate on this planet now criminals love to celebrate their evil that's
[3:49:17.600 --> 3:49:22.320]  true oh they do and you know they want to they want to show people that it's them you know evil
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:26.000]  doesn't want to hide underneath the rock they actually want to be out there because that's
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:29.680]  when they know they have the most control over people is when they can openly yeah that's a
[3:49:29.680 --> 3:49:36.160]  that's everything they want to do that's a really great point the the the criminology of uh uh of
[3:49:36.160 --> 3:49:39.200]  criminals you know there's some people that steal to survive or whatever and then they feel guilty
[3:49:39.200 --> 3:49:44.720]  about it but your real criminal enjoys fooling people they enjoy my you know my dad always said
[3:49:44.720 --> 3:49:49.120]  there's folks that rather cheat you out of a quarter than make a dollar with you and then and they
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:54.400]  enjoy it they they love it and bob is that also part of why they're flaunting it in front of our
[3:49:54.400 --> 3:50:02.320]  face yes it's it's the the pathology of a psychopath and that's just exactly what they are we we uh
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:08.320]  lightly call them sociopaths but they're psychopaths all right who would want to get rid of whole
[3:50:08.320 --> 3:50:15.600]  populations not normal people absolutely i appreciate uh your call uh let's uh go ahead i'm
[3:50:15.600 --> 3:50:20.960]  going to show the prison planet dot tv viewers here on the document cam uh this is out of the uh
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:27.520]  um houston chronicle and it says dps aims for driver's license checkpoints and it says they're
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:31.840]  going to set them up all over the state but they spin it and claim some say it could be for illegal
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:36.880]  aliens knowing it would be popular for the public you know to to do that but this is a trick they
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:42.640]  this is not if you read the fine print for the illegal aliens uh this is for the general
[3:50:42.640 --> 3:50:48.800]  citizenry so uh there is the article dps aims for driver's license checkpoints here's one that
[3:50:48.800 --> 3:50:55.680]  steve watson did that details it uh even more uh for people uh that are uh out there watching it
[3:50:55.680 --> 3:51:00.320]  says the texas agency wants to set up statewide driver's license checkpoints motorists would be
[3:51:00.320 --> 3:51:06.800]  required to prove legal u.s residency as well uh as part of that so that's how they seduce us
[3:51:06.800 --> 3:51:11.520]  you know we get so tired of the illegal aliens running around screaming viva la rosa and the
[3:51:11.520 --> 3:51:15.920]  rest of it that we then begged for this just like they put in thumb scanners in the nineties here
[3:51:15.920 --> 3:51:22.400]  but it wasn't for the illegal aliens uh bob no it's for everybody and they'll they'll let the
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:30.160]  illegal aliens go anyway uh they they just want to exert control now this is part of the uh
[3:51:30.160 --> 3:51:36.800]  metal uh picture of a police state absolutely let's rampage through a few final calls for the
[3:51:36.800 --> 3:51:52.720]  full audience when we come back right now in the final segment with bob Chapman i'm alex jones

[3:52:49.360 --> 3:52:55.200]  to disarm veterans because we're unstable people no no clinton started it bush expanded it and they
[3:52:55.200 --> 3:53:00.560]  people with no criminal record going to buy a gun grandpas uh korean war vets and they're being
[3:53:00.560 --> 3:53:07.200]  turned down absolutely because we know us crazy veterans who served our country you know they
[3:53:07.200 --> 3:53:14.160]  they're afraid of us is what it is um there's also moves to disarm retired cops i mean people cops and
[3:53:14.160 --> 3:53:18.080]  military figure it out you're with the people whether you like it or not you better just go
[3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:24.560]  ahead and realize that and throw in with us oh i'm there i got a thing that says ats on the back
[3:53:24.560 --> 3:53:31.680]  if stands for anti tyranny squad absolutely and i guess i'm one of those uh homegrown parents
[3:53:31.680 --> 3:53:36.000]  because i have a bumper sticker or huge eight by eleven sticker on the back of my truck that says
[3:53:36.640 --> 3:53:43.120]  congress will pay the constitution and i guess in new mexico that's illegal well you know i never
[3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:50.560]  got to this um on the show we have seen in today admitting that that what we told you a decade
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:58.160]  ago that if you protested anyway or even have a table at a farm fair with any political view
[3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:04.560]  even rotary club level the state police nationwide and federal funding and try to infiltrate you
[3:54:04.560 --> 3:54:12.560]  and spy on you and put you in a homegrown extremist camp anyone who's politically active that scene
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:19.680]  is being abnormal the american birthright that it's only normal to watch tv do nothing and they're
[3:54:19.680 --> 3:54:27.760]  announcing it on cnn to intimidate people and uh a sports writer who went and tabled for just a
[3:54:27.760 --> 3:54:35.840]  mainline event at a fair he got investigated and tracked by uh so and again they're announcing this
[3:54:35.840 --> 3:54:42.160]  to intimidate the public don't be intimidated say yeah you bet we're investigating you if you
[3:54:42.160 --> 3:54:48.800]  let them call us they're gonna win see they're acting like it's dirty and bad to bob final comments on
[3:54:48.800 --> 3:54:56.960]  that i think you're absolutely right uh the days of uh voicing political opinion are coming to a
[3:54:56.960 --> 3:55:06.080]  close and you saw it at a convention you described it with uh the imposition of uh police being planted
[3:55:06.080 --> 3:55:13.600]  and and police beating planted policemen and uh and and it's just all part and parcel of the same
[3:55:13.600 --> 3:55:18.480]  thing how would you get a cop worse and worse how would you get a cop to go stage an attack on
[3:55:18.480 --> 3:55:23.120]  other cops to ban free speech i mean how would you feel good at night i mean it's in the denver
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:31.200]  post they admit they do it it's just incredible and it's being done all over the country well i've
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:37.440]  caught them myself i mean i just don't understand how you would sell out for a paycheck bob Chapman
