[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:13.760 --> 00:21.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:21.320 --> 00:36.560]  Texas Alex Jones engaging in common sense nowadays is what you call a
[00:36.560 --> 00:43.200]  conspiracy theory questioning known certified liars is an act of heresy
[00:43.200 --> 00:47.720]  every day there are hit pieces this was out of the International Business Times
[00:47.720 --> 00:53.200]  Ebola hysteria two old conspiracies get new life as deadly virus dominates
[00:53.200 --> 01:05.720]  news cycle and the report goes after info wars calm for absurdly saying that
[01:05.720 --> 01:12.480]  big pharma stands to profit hugely from the Ebola response they've got a whole
[01:12.480 --> 01:16.720]  bunch of vaccines coming out you name it the Bella Melinda Gates Foundation are
[01:16.720 --> 01:24.320]  heavily involved we have governments caught over and over again doing secret
[01:24.320 --> 01:29.600]  test on the population but the media the dinosaur media plays on the ignorance
[01:29.600 --> 01:35.040]  and praise on the ignorance of the general public but even the general
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.360]  public knows about the secret history of testing I was listening to Beyond the
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.840]  Beltway that comes on after my Sunday show here locally out of Chicago I was
[01:43.840 --> 01:50.280]  listening to it on 590 driving home and I heard Bruce Dumont who I've met pretty
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.200]  nice guy but he had medical doctors on they were all bemoaning that most their
[01:55.200 --> 01:59.680]  patients was the quote won't take the flu shot because it's quote from the
[01:59.680 --> 02:05.320]  government that's because people keep getting sick from it and dying from it
[02:05.320 --> 02:11.040]  and then when you bring it up they go all shut up conspiracy theorists people
[02:11.040 --> 02:15.240]  know cause and effect rattlesnake bite you you get sick you get hit by a truck
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.600]  you break bones you fall out of a tree you break your ankle you drink a bottle
[02:19.600 --> 02:23.400]  of whiskey you get drunk you smoke two packs of cigarettes a day for 40 years
[02:23.400 --> 02:30.440]  you get lung cancer you cut yourself shaving you bleed and they just stand
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.640]  there and ridicule that's the only intellectual argument they've got is a
[02:34.640 --> 02:37.880]  non-intellectual argument of that's the conspiracy theorist that's the
[02:37.880 --> 02:42.520]  discredited guy I remember like six months ago they were going in the news
[02:42.520 --> 02:47.280]  yeah Ted Cruz is really in trouble he's discredited he criticized Obamacare and
[02:47.280 --> 02:51.600]  it's a huge success as his poll numbers shoot up as everything he warned about
[02:51.600 --> 02:57.320]  Obamacare was true as he becomes you know almost the frontrunner neck and
[02:57.320 --> 03:00.720]  neck with Rand Paul but I saw all these articles for like a week straight
[03:00.720 --> 03:08.840]  Washington Post New York Times yeah Ted Cruz is really in trouble people are so
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.600]  jealous of Mark Twain other writers they were always saying he was dead or he was
[03:12.600 --> 03:15.480]  bankrupt or he was this or that it's something the losers do they just
[03:15.480 --> 03:24.520]  announce that you failed when you haven't yeah too bad Muhammad Ali never
[03:24.520 --> 03:27.960]  won a heavyweight title it's not true but we could just sit there and say it
[03:27.960 --> 03:33.000]  look at him he couldn't fight a two-year-old they just play this game
[03:33.000 --> 03:42.120]  and the reason I harp on this is it is such incredible mind control that it
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.560]  doesn't work on people that are thinking and involved and try to understand
[03:46.560 --> 03:52.680]  how the world works doesn't mean we know everything versus people I mean I get
[03:52.680 --> 03:55.720]  emails every day and get calls all the time saying Alex you say there's no law
[03:55.720 --> 04:01.280]  to take vaccines but the school says it's a law and I'll tell them are you by
[04:01.280 --> 04:07.200]  computer well yes I am will type in West Virginia vaccine exemption form or type
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.200]  in Texas or type in California they're all the same and it's an exemption from
[04:12.200 --> 04:19.320]  something that isn't even the law it's from a health department policy and they
[04:19.320 --> 04:22.680]  go my gosh it really is true well they lied to me the principal and the nurse
[04:22.680 --> 04:28.400]  said it was the law yes you're involved in facing a criminal conspiracy and
[04:28.400 --> 04:31.840]  doesn't mean even mean the principal the teacher or an eightly evil they just
[04:31.840 --> 04:34.800]  were told by the health department a lot of people is for the greater good so
[04:34.800 --> 04:40.120]  they're part of the conspiracy they've been brought into it I mean how do you
[04:40.120 --> 04:43.640]  think they had tens of thousands of people involved injecting blacks over
[04:43.640 --> 04:46.920]  40-something years with cephalus and keeping it secret as they spread it all
[04:46.920 --> 04:51.400]  over the country because once you're into the cover-up you then start covering

[08:17.800 --> 08:23.680]  GCN radio network he popped in with us for about 20 minutes last week we'll be
[08:23.680 --> 08:27.560]  on this for about 40 minutes today Max Kaiser is coming up to talk about Ebola
[08:27.560 --> 08:31.680]  the economy the bond market the gold market and what he sees coming up in
[08:31.680 --> 08:35.640]  the future will open the phones up as well I want to open the phones up early
[08:35.640 --> 08:39.440]  in this hour something I really have a lot of trouble doing is I like to start
[08:39.440 --> 08:44.400]  perseverating and basically ranting before we ever even go to your phone
[08:44.400 --> 08:49.840]  calls but I do want to open the phones up specifically on what you think the
[08:49.840 --> 08:54.920]  next big shoe to drop is in this in this season of crisis starting wars with
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.120]  Russia openly funding al-qaeda changing the name to confuse the public
[08:59.120 --> 09:04.760]  political persecution in America open NSA spying against Congress and the
[09:04.760 --> 09:08.880]  American people what do you think the next big shoe to drop is and what is the
[09:08.880 --> 09:17.160]  Ebola story distracting from popping in at the bottom of the hour will be info
[09:17.160 --> 09:22.280]  wars nightly news host and also info wars radio host David Knight was a
[09:22.280 --> 09:27.080]  pretty smart guy an engineer in his own right headline from a story he wrote
[09:27.080 --> 09:33.960]  last week is a possible Ebola cure being hidden from the public DARPA and
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.000]  pharmaceutical companies spent years and millions of dollars to create a GMO
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.320]  imitation of a treatment they say is unproven less like big companies are
[09:44.320 --> 09:48.240]  going out and changing the molecules on fish oil and then patenting it and then
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.080]  charging two hundred three hundred dollars for a bottle that should be thirty
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.520]  dollars and then having the FDA try to shut down people making claims about
[09:55.520 --> 10:00.200]  over-the-counter fish oil and they've spent last time I checked it was like a
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.240]  hundred million dollars one big company alone a few years ago to actually get
[10:04.240 --> 10:09.440]  approved modified fish oil so they could then make claims and put it on your
[10:09.440 --> 10:13.920]  insurance and it's not even as good as the natural fish oil then they have all
[10:13.920 --> 10:18.360]  these propaganda pieces fish oils got mercury in it they have systems that
[10:18.360 --> 10:24.920]  remove it 100% and it simply says on the bottle it has been treated and has
[10:24.920 --> 10:30.440]  been put through the systems to have zero mercury all the high-quality brands
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.480]  been mercury free for decades but that's not even what I'm getting into here is
[10:35.480 --> 10:39.720]  that when you study the news constantly it is so frustrating to see the
[10:39.720 --> 10:47.160]  propaganda that's put out because they had the international business times
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.320]  that actually does some good reporting from time to time come out and demonize
[10:51.320 --> 11:00.400]  David Knight and his article for the very reason because it is so credible
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.040]  David really comes out with thoughtful investigative video reports and in
[11:05.040 --> 11:11.080]  articles just like when Curt Nimmo dared say last week that Big Pharma is set
[11:11.080 --> 11:15.480]  to roll out at least three vaccines in the next six months one of them by
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.680]  December and then he linked in his article to mainstream news admitting
[11:19.680 --> 11:23.120]  they're coming out with the vaccine and other treatments that are set to make
[11:23.120 --> 11:29.520]  billions and billions and billions a week if they're adopted and they just
[11:29.520 --> 11:34.760]  said he's insane and says that they're set to make money when there's no proof
[11:34.760 --> 11:42.280]  haha he says two plus two equals four it's this childlike mind game that they
[11:42.280 --> 11:47.760]  play where they go man Alex Jones is really discredited I use the example
[11:47.760 --> 11:51.560]  earlier of number six months ago is for a couple weeks it was headlines every
[11:51.560 --> 11:56.240]  hour in every publication you can imagine Ted Cruz is discredited yeah he
[11:56.240 --> 12:02.000]  did a filibuster a few months ago and Obamacare such a big success that Ted
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.040]  Cruz is in trouble then you'd read the article and Ted Cruz's approval rating
[12:07.040 --> 12:14.520]  was skyrocketing so it's perception management it's like saying that hamburger
[12:14.520 --> 12:18.120]  place has cockroaches in its patties but really your patties have got the
[12:18.120 --> 12:23.360]  cockroaches and here's a little newsflash all the neocons and all the
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.760]  fake liberals and all the establishment types there's a reason Congress has a
[12:27.760 --> 12:32.880]  seven percent approval rating in Gallup there's a reason the CDC here's an
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.800]  article out of CBS News has the lowest approval rating ever public confidence
[12:37.800 --> 12:46.920]  in CDC nosedives poll finds it's because we don't have confidence in you and you
[12:46.920 --> 12:50.200]  can try to kill the messenger all day you can try to change the subject on the
[12:50.200 --> 12:54.120]  Alex Jones you can even put a bullet in my head or set me up or do whatever you
[12:54.120 --> 13:00.280]  want do you understand you can destroy my name and then destroy me physically or
[13:00.280 --> 13:06.920]  lock me up I know that's how this works but I win because I did the right thing
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.880]  for my family and your family who will live together in the future and I didn't
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.920]  compromise and I didn't back off because the signal has already been sent and you
[13:18.920 --> 13:25.480]  cannot stop the signal you understand that the transmission has already been
[13:25.480 --> 13:31.360]  sent what does it matter militarily if there's been a transmitter sending the
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.480]  truth out for years and the entire population of the area is awake and
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.520]  basically knows what's going on and then you blow up the transmitter all you do
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.720]  is validate it and vindicate it and sure you've got maybe half the public that
[13:45.720 --> 13:52.280]  only watch a sports center or sitcoms or medical drama shows and literally takes
[13:52.280 --> 13:56.680]  the flu shots and buys into anything everything they're told those people
[13:56.680 --> 14:00.000]  don't count and we're never going to count they were set in front of
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.840]  televisions and their dirty diapers from birth and aren't even real people
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.640]  they're wrecked robots then you've got a small minority of sociopaths
[14:10.640 --> 14:17.440]  mercenaries psychopaths borderline personality disorder type people that
[14:17.440 --> 14:20.960]  work for the system and work for the government who want to go out and
[14:20.960 --> 14:26.080]  persecute innocent people and who hate those of us that expose the fraud of
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.440]  the system but they've got a problem because there's a giant swath of people
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.680]  in government and corporations that are very moral but we're just asleep and
[14:34.680 --> 14:41.000]  now see how corrupt things openly are so they're waking up remember George W.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.480]  Bush saying eight years ago when NSA whistleblowers from AT&T and other
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.840]  places went public and said listen whole floors of our telecoms are hooked
[14:50.840 --> 14:55.440]  into the NSA the NSA runs whole floors and everything going through them is
[14:55.440 --> 14:58.920]  being listened to with data mining and they are looking at the American people
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.720]  and the DEA is tracking everything you do in real time and then creating fake
[15:02.720 --> 15:09.320]  court cases to set you up Bush came out and said it's ridiculous you know I
[15:09.320 --> 15:13.520]  can't do a very good bush like I can do a Clinton you know what I'm saying well
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.840]  come on it's ridiculous we don't listen to anybody's calls in America without a
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.680]  warrant that's overseas calls that's out kind of you can pull those clips up we
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.560]  played them many times and it wasn't true it was a lie and now it comes out the
[15:28.560 --> 15:33.000]  British Parliament's being spied on by their NSA Congress is being spied on
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.320]  the House and the Senate the governors the Secret Service the FBI the ATF and
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.080]  do you know what they're being spied on I don't want to get Wayne Madsen back on
[15:43.080 --> 15:45.840]  these now back in the country I know he's on a few weeks ago and night was
[15:45.840 --> 15:55.000]  filling in but I want to get him on air as soon as possible because I mean I
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.320]  remember having him on like 16 years ago I've been interviewing him since about
[16:00.320 --> 16:07.640]  1998 and he was a tree that fell in the forest that nobody heard it so did it
[16:07.640 --> 16:15.120]  really make a sound well yes he did he's ten times more intel on the NSA and how
[16:15.120 --> 16:18.800]  it worked and what they did and has testified to Congress and the EU
[16:18.800 --> 16:24.000]  Parliament and the British Parliament you name it but because the media
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.480]  ignored him it never got any attention we knew this from James Bamford the
[16:28.480 --> 16:36.080]  former head producer of Nightline for 20 years he quit Nightline he was so
[16:36.080 --> 16:41.320]  freaked out by what he knew and went and wrote two best-selling books about the
[16:41.320 --> 16:50.440]  NSA spying on everyone and Madsen they've all been on the show countless
[16:50.440 --> 16:58.080]  times and I've had Benny on the director of operations and just countless
[16:58.080 --> 17:02.760]  other whistleblowers and they've told you it's targeting political speech it's
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.920]  being used for blackmail it's being used to set people up it's being used to stop
[17:06.920 --> 17:10.680]  members of the ATF blowing the whistle on Fast and Furious it's being used to
[17:10.680 --> 17:14.640]  stop members of the FBI stopping other government agencies involved in money
[17:14.640 --> 17:18.680]  laundering it's being used so that the big banks have intel on what the whole
[17:18.680 --> 17:23.560]  government's doing Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America under different
[17:23.560 --> 17:31.320]  systems they have more access to the NSA than any government agency does this is
[17:31.320 --> 17:37.760]  a corporate coup over America who do you think funds the gun control the
[17:37.760 --> 17:41.800]  victim disarmament the bill of Melinda Gates Foundation is number one in this
[17:41.800 --> 17:47.240]  country look it up it's all federal filings number two is Goldman Sachs
[17:47.240 --> 17:52.160]  number three is JP Morgan last time I checked and it goes down the list
[17:52.160 --> 18:00.760]  Bert Schier Hathaway and a lot of times it's the same group giving over and over
[18:00.760 --> 18:05.400]  again who do you think is Bert Schier Hathaway and Wells Fargo and Bill of
[18:05.400 --> 18:10.360]  Melinda Gates that's Warren Buffett about a third of the money in that and you
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.880]  understand these are the people that literally want us to live in 1984 that
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.520]  literally want to take our freedoms that want to cut the IRS fraud
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.200]  investigators for billionaires and increase the investigators for blue
[18:22.200 --> 18:28.720]  collar people that's on record to literally break the back of everyone in
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.560]  this country to shut down our power plants to shut down our factories to
[18:32.560 --> 18:38.200]  break up our families to do everything they can to totally bring this country
[18:38.200 --> 18:43.840]  down and so America is having to come to Jesus moment where people throughout the
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.480]  system the military you name it are saying you know it's really true that
[18:48.480 --> 18:51.400]  criminal elements of our government are funding Al Qaeda we're not gonna be part
[18:51.400 --> 18:56.280]  of it you know what Alex Jones told the truth Ron Paul came on this show three
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.360]  weeks ago and said yes we need to release the 28 pages and looks like there
[19:01.360 --> 19:08.760]  was a cover-up of 9-11 and you've got members of Congress coming out and
[19:08.760 --> 19:14.600]  Bill's introduced see we were right about that again it doesn't mean there
[19:14.600 --> 19:17.960]  aren't radical Islamists in that doesn't mean they weren't involved when the
[19:17.960 --> 19:21.480]  media spins it and says that I said George Bush had a plunger like Wiley
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.040]  Cuyo detonating it I never said that I said they allowed us to be attacked
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.240]  bare minimum and had a stand down so they could radically take our liberties
[19:29.240 --> 19:32.920]  and freedoms that's come out Harvard admits fluoride is brain damaging our
[19:32.920 --> 19:37.320]  children and giving them cancer vindicated vindicated our government's
[19:37.320 --> 19:40.800]  laundering most the major drug money and finding the big drug cartels that's
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.720]  even in the Chicago Tribune it comes out in court vindicating Gary Webb who they
[19:44.720 --> 19:51.960]  killed vindicated vindicated so the good news is we're being vindicated but when
[19:51.960 --> 19:55.040]  they sit back there and point their finger at us and laugh at us we're
[19:55.040 --> 19:59.040]  saying two plus two equals four remember that's all they've got is a desperate mind

[24:11.640 --> 24:15.880]  talk about his article from last week that's being demonized by establishment
[24:15.880 --> 24:20.280]  media is a possible Ebola cure being hidden from the public we're gonna talk
[24:20.280 --> 24:23.800]  about it coming up in the next segment demonized by the international
[24:23.800 --> 24:30.160]  business Times and this is just such a reasonable article that he wrote
[24:30.160 --> 24:37.160]  bibliographed linking to all the proof I just so well researched and so they
[24:37.160 --> 24:41.440]  attack it so I think David should do another video report on this as well
[24:41.440 --> 24:46.600]  and we should feature it since it upsets the establishment so much boy
[24:46.600 --> 24:49.880]  every time we talk about big pharma obviously trying to profit from this
[24:49.880 --> 24:55.120]  with dangerous experimental vaccines they just say there's no such thing well I
[24:55.120 --> 25:02.120]  want to tell the listeners something that Google and Microsoft and the NSA
[25:02.120 --> 25:07.880]  and DARPA and IBM and all these public-private partnerships already know
[25:07.880 --> 25:15.840]  and I don't say this to brag about it I say it because I can feel the palpable
[25:15.840 --> 25:22.080]  electrical crack of attention and fortune and danger and the fortune we
[25:22.080 --> 25:26.760]  seek is liberty and the survival and expansion and development of the species
[25:26.760 --> 25:33.920]  goodwill trailblazing strength and honor all the things that are under attack it
[25:33.920 --> 25:38.960]  doesn't mean we're perfect but we know what we love we know what we worship we
[25:38.960 --> 25:46.120]  know what we support is the good God not the bad God you can say don't believe
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.920]  in God okay whatever I don't want to dumb people down I don't want to enslave
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.760]  people I want to try to tell the truth and be honorable and I don't choose my
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.760]  reality I really try to discover what real reality is the mysteries of the
[26:00.760 --> 26:06.640]  universe life is so fantastical so amazing I hate having to spend my time
[26:06.640 --> 26:11.920]  focused on the globalist which are only one small part of the universe but
[26:11.920 --> 26:19.620]  they're right here sitting on top of us on this planet I just cry sometimes I
[26:19.620 --> 26:25.600]  get tears in my eyes when I see just all the wonders of the world and all the
[26:25.600 --> 26:30.960]  experiences and just the feel of nature especially in the fall and spring it's
[26:30.960 --> 26:38.440]  just so wonderful and then you juxtapose that the innocence of children the
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.600]  beauty of the clouds in the sky the stars all of it to the evil of the system
[26:43.600 --> 26:49.960]  and the fraud that it is just rejected but before I get into the news and take
[26:49.960 --> 26:54.120]  your calls I wanted just to make this little announcement to everybody and I
[26:54.120 --> 27:01.200]  do this occasionally exponentially whether I am in the south the east of
[27:01.200 --> 27:05.040]  the west or in England or in Central America or I talk to people that have
[27:05.040 --> 27:08.600]  gone all over the world and we get the feedback from all over the planet info
[27:08.600 --> 27:19.320]  wars.com and Alex Jones yours truly and my entire team are beyond rock star
[27:19.320 --> 27:25.960]  level popular in huge pockets all over the world not with the crowds that
[27:25.960 --> 27:33.240]  follow the Kardashians or the crowds that religiously only follow ESPN
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.240]  I'm not saying you're bad if you like ESPN or the Kardashians you know what I
[27:37.240 --> 27:43.040]  mean it's that people only care about stuff like that the liberty movement is
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.480]  exploding worldwide and the feedback I get I mean I went to main event with my
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.840]  children and some friends and their children a few weekends ago to bowl to
[27:52.840 --> 28:00.040]  big bowling video game place and almost everyone I walked by shook my hand and
[28:00.040 --> 28:04.520]  was a listener almost everyone and in guys in football jerseys who were
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.960]  there bowling so I shouldn't criticize football fans but obviously that
[28:07.960 --> 28:10.880]  person's a listener football isn't there you know the only thing they're into
[28:10.880 --> 28:17.360]  they're more balanced is my point literally almost everyone and to the point
[28:17.360 --> 28:23.120]  if I couldn't bowl I couldn't play air hockey with the kids I couldn't rock
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.600]  climb they have indoor rock climbing I was just shaking hands the whole time
[28:26.600 --> 28:30.160]  and they weren't just people that kind of knew who I was and seen a video here
[28:30.160 --> 28:35.560]  there they were hardcore listeners same thing with military police you name it
[28:35.560 --> 28:42.760]  the system knows we are gigantic our footprint of info wars calm prison
[28:42.760 --> 28:46.760]  planet calm he's only liked a little rock in the pond as I've said many times
[28:46.760 --> 28:53.440]  we're only the rock as it hits the water but the ripples are gigantic and the
[28:53.440 --> 28:59.160]  ripples of what you do with a YouTube channel or a local radio show are giant
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.760]  as well and when you do the right thing those ripples go on forever and that's
[29:03.760 --> 29:08.080]  why the system is coming out against us it's why they're demonizing us it's why
[29:08.080 --> 29:14.160]  they're trying to assassinate my character and I feel that they'll be
[29:14.160 --> 29:18.320]  coming after me very very soon and that's okay that's what I've this with
[29:18.320 --> 29:23.280]  the whole point of this is to go up head up against the new world order and be
[29:23.280 --> 29:28.880]  an example against them that matter if we don't make every step right or we're
[29:28.880 --> 29:32.440]  not Pharisees here ladies and gentlemen we're not talking about the you know the
[29:32.440 --> 29:37.160]  the spec and other people's eyes we're in the arena going as hard as we can and
[29:37.160 --> 29:40.480]  asking God for providence and I think we'll go through the storm but we're
[29:40.480 --> 29:43.840]  still in the storm but I could see the blue sky through the lightning on the
[29:43.840 --> 29:47.600]  other side and all of us can make it out of this together but Liberty is popular

[34:26.160 --> 34:30.760]  out that makes a hundred billion dollars literally worldwide more virologists have
[34:30.760 --> 34:34.600]  come out over the weekend and said clearly it's mutated now they're saying
[34:34.600 --> 34:40.640]  it doesn't just last 70 days in the testicles of men and sperm now they're
[34:40.640 --> 34:44.440]  saying they're finding people that it's lasting 41 days in that guys I forgot to
[34:44.440 --> 34:48.520]  IM you that or email that this morning in the news list about for I think it was
[34:48.520 --> 34:54.880]  Reuters or something but the headline was a bolo can live 41 days in some people
[34:54.880 --> 34:58.600]  I think was the headline they're now finding it's not 21 now it's 41 folks
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.720]  the flu you're contagious for a week sometimes longer sometimes shorter that
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.640]  you know colds a few days this is horrible this is where we'll just walk
[35:07.640 --> 35:15.240]  around with a bolo for 70 days or 41 days that's why it's so bad it kills 70
[35:15.240 --> 35:19.360]  percent of people that's when you get medical care if you don't it's like 90
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.360]  so it is a crisis because they're not even doing things to stop it now that's
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.200]  separately people in the office said man you got a tan yeah I've been going out
[35:29.200 --> 35:32.760]  and getting as much fall sun as I can taking my kids out to the local community
[35:32.760 --> 35:36.640]  pool Barton Springs you know it's still warm down here in Texas because it's
[35:36.640 --> 35:40.160]  when that vitamin D and stuff runs out in the deep of winter three months after
[35:40.160 --> 35:45.560]  no son that everybody gets a deathly ill so sunlight vitamin D vitamin B12 is
[35:45.560 --> 35:51.200]  what I'm doing survival shield nason iodine x2 it's not a total silver
[35:51.200 --> 35:54.600]  bullet though it's called silver bullet that's the name before all this of our
[35:54.600 --> 36:00.120]  colloidal silver I'm taking that info wars life calm and I'm just doing that to
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.360]  bolster my body's natural defenses that's the number one thing you never
[36:04.360 --> 36:10.080]  anything in mainstream media about how to prevent Ebola or how to boost your
[36:10.080 --> 36:13.800]  immune systems you don't catch it to begin with just like it's always we're
[36:13.800 --> 36:18.280]  gonna beat breast cancer we're gonna find a way to cure it well they know the
[36:18.280 --> 36:24.160]  giant rising and it's admitted is from the estrogen based tumors that's over
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.960]  80% of the breast cancer almost all the 3000% increase in the United States
[36:28.960 --> 36:32.480]  England other places we've seen since the 40s breast cancer was rare in the
[36:32.480 --> 36:39.400]  40s and 50s and 60s glyphosate in the water grows breast cancer and other
[36:39.400 --> 36:45.400]  cancers in in male and female sexual tissues like the prostate prostate
[36:45.400 --> 36:50.480]  cancer off the chart and boy if you're black and you drink glyphosates kiss
[36:50.480 --> 36:55.280]  your butt goodbye because it kills white people Asians and Hispanics bad it you
[36:55.280 --> 36:58.400]  might as well just stick a fork in yourself if you're black and you're
[36:58.400 --> 37:03.200]  drinking glyphosate now you can look up that number look up blacks in glyphosate
[37:03.200 --> 37:09.640]  or blacks and estrogen members or black males have double double the prostate
[37:09.640 --> 37:16.920]  cancer double there's an example right there they're not telling anyone any of
[37:16.920 --> 37:21.200]  this information so purified water that's what I'm personally doing consult
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.080]  your own physician but they don't even teach physicians about nutrition they
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.520]  don't teach him about sunlight cast Sunstein six years ago when he first
[37:29.520 --> 37:34.200]  got into power as the regulations are wrote public manuals on how to infiltrate
[37:34.200 --> 37:37.360]  alternative media how to cause infighting and he also said we need to
[37:37.360 --> 37:41.560]  start with trying to ban people saying sunlight's good for you folks you will
[37:41.560 --> 37:48.280]  die without sunlight too much of it will also kill you so it but it's kind of
[37:48.280 --> 37:53.120]  like rock in a hard place you need it but it also does end up killing you but
[37:53.120 --> 37:57.120]  it'll kill you faster if you don't have it that's why white people are white
[37:57.120 --> 38:03.040]  because they they came from north of the equator where there was a little bit of
[38:03.040 --> 38:08.240]  Sun and if you didn't get it you'd die black people come from the equator they
[38:08.240 --> 38:11.560]  don't need too much Sun so their skin blocks it but if you're black and you
[38:11.560 --> 38:15.800]  don't get sunlight it's even worse than if you're white and don't get it look it
[38:15.800 --> 38:19.440]  up this is what it's all based on and more and more medical doctors know all
[38:19.440 --> 38:28.280]  this I don't mean to go off in a jag here about Ebola and the fact that they
[38:28.280 --> 38:31.360]  don't want people to know some of the basic stuff that bolsters your own
[38:31.360 --> 38:38.400]  immune system common sense things well the great part about it is these are in
[38:38.400 --> 38:41.240]  my view and what I've experienced life-changing products you've heard
[38:41.240 --> 38:45.920]  the callers what it's done survival shield nasa i9 x2 DNA force super male

[39:15.720 --> 39:21.080]  transmission possible as well now here's an article the reason David Nights in
[39:21.080 --> 39:25.800]  studio with us Ebola hysteria two old conspiracies get new life as deadly
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.960]  virus dominates news cycle and in this International Business Times article
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.520]  they criticize major papers in Africa because you know that they're not allowed
[39:34.520 --> 39:37.200]  to have their own papers over there you know they're just Africans what do they
[39:37.200 --> 39:40.640]  know you know it's kind of that soft racism from the controlled media and
[39:40.640 --> 39:44.560]  left oh they've got top virologist and people by the way in those news articles
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.040]  they link to saying they believe it's a bio weapon and we have an article on that
[39:48.040 --> 39:54.200]  in the video we're going to plan a few minutes and so they demonize the idea
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.880]  that it's a plan to give us vaccines to reduce population and then they move
[39:57.880 --> 40:04.400]  along after demonizing that HIV and Ebola were created by the US as a
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.480]  biological weapon to say that it's an attack on Obama and it says info wars.com
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.520]  a popular website for these types of stories is also perpetuating the theory
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.400]  the government and pharma logical companies are conspiring to find a way
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.640]  to maximize profitability oh no they would never do that namely by suppressing
[40:21.640 --> 40:27.200]  a less costly cure to promote their more profitable genetically modified cure
[40:27.200 --> 40:30.480]  well David Nights in his article last week that they linked to and demonize
[40:30.480 --> 40:36.360]  says is is a possible Ebola cure being hidden from the public and then he
[40:36.360 --> 40:40.160]  points out that they took a well-known treatment that isn't really a cure but
[40:40.160 --> 40:43.600]  but has a huge success rate because you cure has to do it all the time not a
[40:43.600 --> 40:48.440]  treatment okay like they got treatments for heart attacks doesn't mean it's a
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.920]  cure for heart disease it's a treatment and it could sometimes help you and I
[40:54.920 --> 41:00.720]  wanted David out to talk about this so so so if this promising treatment isn't
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.200]  good why are they trying to create one they can make money off of by making it
[41:04.200 --> 41:08.200]  synthetic making it artificial see by changing it like fish oil changing the
[41:08.200 --> 41:11.400]  molecule they can then charge you 300 bucks to make you get a prescription and
[41:11.400 --> 41:18.600]  then under the UN agenda 21 UNESCO Treaty and Codex Alimentarius run by the
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.880]  big corporations they can literally ban vitamin C and fish oil as they're doing
[41:22.880 --> 41:27.880]  in Europe are lowering the allowance for you pay a hundred euros for a little
[41:27.880 --> 41:33.760]  bottle of vitamin C and the caplets are so weak they do nothing for you see they
[41:33.760 --> 41:39.280]  just lower the allowance more and more at Codex Alimentarius until it just does
[41:39.280 --> 41:43.540]  nothing that's that's the real thing that's happening they've already lowered
[41:43.540 --> 41:47.200]  vitamin C something like 10 times what it was back in the 50s Linus Pauling won a
[41:47.200 --> 41:51.360]  Nobel Prize for it so David I wanted you to be able to respond to this they
[41:51.360 --> 41:54.600]  demonize Kurt saying they want to profit from it and saying vaccines are
[41:54.600 --> 41:58.840]  coming out they do have vaccines coming out but but your story separate from just
[41:58.840 --> 42:04.960]  the vaccines we're talking about things that are very promising as
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.120]  treatments that they're trying to synthetically create while blocking the
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.480]  one that's available right now big farmers famous for this but they point
[42:13.480 --> 42:16.840]  their finger at you as if they're Moses on the mountain and say David Knight
[42:16.840 --> 42:20.800]  he's not allowed to write an article only International Business Times has
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.120]  credibility because they said so David Knight yeah Alex there's a fundamental
[42:25.120 --> 42:28.480]  contradiction at the bottom of this is why I wrote the article in first place
[42:28.480 --> 42:31.680]  they're telling people and we saw these stories we covered it on the nightly
[42:31.680 --> 42:35.280]  news back in the middle of September the fact that there's this large black
[42:35.280 --> 42:40.440]  market and blood of Ebola survivors because that's what people were putting
[42:40.440 --> 42:44.280]  a lot of confidence and we've seen Dr. Kent Brantley who was the very first
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.080]  doctor to be brought back to Emory University outside of the CDC people
[42:48.080 --> 42:52.120]  surviving got it yes Duncan up in Dallas didn't get it that's right he got and
[42:52.120 --> 42:55.640]  and his relatives complained about that they said you didn't give him any
[42:55.640 --> 42:59.280]  convalescent serum you didn't give him a blood transfusion actually you know like
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.880]  as you said it's not necessarily a cure they've had very good results with this
[43:03.880 --> 43:07.560]  and they've had some tests with it they have a cure is a hundred percent but
[43:07.560 --> 43:11.160]  it's a powerful treatment that's right but it does cure some people I guess you
[43:11.160 --> 43:14.680]  could say exactly the underlying well they did a study back in 1995 outbreak
[43:14.680 --> 43:18.680]  with just eight patients and that's a very very small population to try to
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.040]  prove that something is effective but they did a you know they've given these
[43:23.040 --> 43:26.960]  dosages of Z map to only seven patients and you see the mainstream media
[43:26.960 --> 43:31.200]  touting it as a miracle cure and then you see the Gates Foundation and the
[43:31.200 --> 43:35.080]  Welcome Trust pouring millions tens of millions hundreds of millions into this
[43:35.080 --> 43:39.200]  to try to mass produce it you got all these biopharmaceutical companies as
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.840]  well as agricultural pharmaceutical companies gearing up to do this and you
[43:43.840 --> 43:48.240]  have to look at this and say why is this a miracle cure when the natural one is
[43:48.240 --> 43:52.000]  unproven and they'll have to look at it at some day in the future that's what the
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.440]  WHO can keep saying they say well it looks like it might be promising but you
[43:55.440 --> 43:58.920]  know we really haven't run any tests on this and so we really can't pursue that
[43:58.920 --> 44:02.360]  all they would have to do if they wanted to pursue this treatment would be to
[44:02.360 --> 44:06.160]  cheaply set up a donor registry of blood type so people get the right blood
[44:06.160 --> 44:10.240]  type and then screen it for disease but they won't we know Africa is already
[44:10.240 --> 44:15.240]  having massive success with it in the Ebola camps so they already know that's
[44:15.240 --> 44:18.920]  why as you said the last decade they produce the synthetic one and here's
[44:18.920 --> 44:23.880]  and that's the key look at how Z-map works Z-map works exactly like
[44:23.880 --> 44:28.480]  convalescent serum has worked for the last 125 years they had a German
[44:28.480 --> 44:32.560]  scientist win a Nobel Prize for this back in 1901 the idea is similar to a
[44:32.560 --> 44:35.560]  vaccine except that a vaccine is supposed to give you preventive immunity
[44:35.560 --> 44:38.760]  this gives you a passive immunity in other words when you're already sick with
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.000]  something they take antibodies not the disease but antibodies from somebody
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.880]  who's recovered and they inject that into the patient it's really a true
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.520]  vaccine because you're getting real living vaccine a body created right
[44:50.520 --> 44:56.560]  live and putting it in I mean that's amazing for the T lymphocyte white blood
[44:56.560 --> 45:01.080]  cells to pick it up and get marching orders right real human antibodies from
[45:01.080 --> 45:04.680]  somebody who survived to give your immune system a boost because you're not
[45:04.680 --> 45:07.960]  it's not going to cure you but it would give your immune system a boost give it
[45:07.960 --> 45:12.000]  a little bit of a head start on this so that's the idea behind that they've
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.200]  used it to treat diphtheria they've used it to treat measles they've used it to
[45:15.200 --> 45:18.800]  treat tetanus a whole wide range of things even in the SARS outbreak you
[45:18.800 --> 45:22.280]  had a Hong Kong scientist but this is something they can't centralize like
[45:22.280 --> 45:25.400]  vitamins and minerals so they're not going to let it be developed exactly so
[45:25.400 --> 45:30.040]  what they're doing with Z-Map is they're essentially mimicking that but using a
[45:30.040 --> 45:34.480]  patented artificial genetically modified and a transgenic genetically
[45:34.480 --> 45:37.640]  modified process to do this in other words instead of injecting human
[45:37.640 --> 45:42.080]  antibodies they give Ebola to a mouse and when the mouse produces antibodies
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.440]  they genetically modify those antibodies and then they grow those
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.800]  antibodies and genetically modified tobacco plants okay or they are now
[45:49.800 --> 45:54.000]  talking about growing it in animals so they can mass produce it using the here's
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.520]  the problem now and even Forbes gets into it the problem is is that this
[45:58.520 --> 46:02.840]  thing's mutated 300 plus times in the last six months with human blood you
[46:02.840 --> 46:06.200]  can always get the latest and synthesize something out of that that is
[46:06.200 --> 46:10.440]  catching the latest bad mutation this won't work with big pharma the turn
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.720]  around with the mice and the tobacco is months right sorry go ahead but it's
[46:14.720 --> 46:19.720]  also it underscores the fact that this truly is about making profits for them
[46:19.720 --> 46:23.160]  because it wasn't make about just making profits for them they could take human
[46:23.160 --> 46:26.680]  antibodies and they could try to reproduce those human antibodies in a
[46:26.680 --> 46:30.080]  plant but instead they start with a genetically modified mouse antibody why
[46:30.080 --> 46:34.000]  because they can patent that they can patent something that they took from
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.440]  somebody else right Supreme Court's been striking down which they already tried
[46:37.440 --> 46:41.560]  saying they can own human DNA so now they're doing the mouse so they're
[46:41.560 --> 46:44.600]  going to take this very long approach and here's the other thing that worries
[46:44.600 --> 46:47.520]  me about this Alex that's because the mice are patented to you have their
[46:47.520 --> 46:50.840]  special right they want they want to mass produce this make sure they've got all
[46:50.840 --> 46:54.480]  the licensing agreements set up for this oh of course not they're not worried
[46:54.480 --> 46:58.320]  about profits right this is just their tax write off for the well clearly a
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.120]  talking point went out David Knight because I've seen let me not exaggerate
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.360]  I hardly even follow it but I get Google alerts when the news probably five
[47:06.360 --> 47:11.080]  articles a day saying we're horrible for saying they want profits and then
[47:11.080 --> 47:15.080]  maybe a six or seven other articles a day saying we're insane I mean people
[47:15.080 --> 47:19.840]  could say I'm bombast I'm bombastic I am sometimes a rabble rouser or whatever
[47:19.840 --> 47:23.520]  and that's entertaining and folks like it but I'm I'm a real person but I have
[47:23.520 --> 47:27.840]  all these other serious reporters here as well as we try to get more serious and
[47:27.840 --> 47:32.200]  we're focused and they attack you guys even more because it is the credibility
[47:32.200 --> 47:37.960]  they don't like if it wasn't about the money why are they waiting for months to
[47:37.960 --> 47:41.040]  get this ramped up into production before they start introducing it to
[47:41.040 --> 47:44.740]  people when they could cheaply do it right now with a donor registry they
[47:44.740 --> 47:48.080]  want to sell this and I believe they want it to get larger I believe that
[47:48.080 --> 47:52.000]  they want it to get beyond Africa clearly Africa doesn't have the money to pay
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.200]  for expensive treatments or for vaccines or whatever they want it to get into the
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.280]  West they can get the resources of Africa if this thing gets out of hand but
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.960]  they want to get the West forced to charge some kind of a vaccine that's
[48:03.960 --> 48:07.080]  going to make them a lot of money but the bottom line is why would they why
[48:07.080 --> 48:10.280]  would they imitate something that they say is unproven and we know that it's
[48:10.280 --> 48:13.880]  proven because they've used it for 125 years successfully and it's just a
[48:13.880 --> 48:18.680]  treatment it's like when they're when they're vomiting and have massive loss
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.320]  of bodily fluids with diarrhea they need to be rehydrated they need to keep
[48:22.320 --> 48:25.120]  their electrolytes in balance if you don't give that to somebody they're
[48:25.120 --> 48:28.880]  going to die and so they say well we don't really know if that's effective by
[48:28.880 --> 48:32.000]  itself because of course it was a combined with this they're withholding
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  treatment from people in Africa claiming they're looking for a miracle drug
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.000]  David they don't like this I want you to really do a big report on this video and
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.800]  text for Wednesday and I want you to come in and co-host on Wednesday and
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.640]  really spend an hour on this maybe get some medical doctors on as well because
[48:47.640 --> 48:51.840]  they're scared of us covering this so we better stay on it if they're trying to
[48:51.840 --> 48:54.240]  shut us up we're not going to be intimidated by them we're going to
[48:54.240 --> 48:57.960]  continue to focus in on things that are curing some people like blood
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.920]  transfusions that they don't want the public to know about thank you so much
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.760]  David night thank you one other point we're going to come back and play this
[49:04.760 --> 49:08.520]  clip David they also in this article out of international business times
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.400]  demonize one of the biggest papers in Africa for having an epidemiologist and
[49:14.400 --> 49:17.920]  virologist two different ones being interviewed saying they believe it's
[49:17.920 --> 49:23.080]  been souped up in a bio weapon lab and then that article that they even linked
[49:23.080 --> 49:28.960]  to links back to the huge trials that they had in Europe at the EU and in
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.960]  South Africa where they admitted a secret bio weapon program between Israel
[49:32.960 --> 49:40.440]  the US and South Africa where they use South Africa to produce a basically a
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.880]  vaccine that sterilizes African women by having them create an autoimmune
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.880]  response to sperm now this all came out and was admitted this isn't this is why
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.480]  you have African Nobel Prize winners and African presidents and African
[49:55.480 --> 49:59.800]  virologist coming out and saying this looks like it's been souped up the you
[49:59.800 --> 50:04.440]  the West has labs here we think something's going on well they have to be
[50:04.440 --> 50:08.400]  crazy not to think that because the history of it David oh yeah you had
[50:08.400 --> 50:11.760]  situations course everybody knows the Tuskegee Institute where they
[50:11.760 --> 50:15.080]  experimented back in the 1930s on black people right through to the 70s right
[50:15.080 --> 50:19.720]  right and and what happened to that scientist who is head of that study well
[50:19.720 --> 50:25.040]  they had a medical historian realized that after that Tuskegee study they had
[50:25.040 --> 50:28.720]  a doctor who went down to Guatemala and with the approval of the American
[50:28.720 --> 50:32.320]  get it there and with the Guatemalan government they did experiments on
[50:32.320 --> 50:35.320]  people down there without their full consent the first story that I did
[50:35.320 --> 50:39.160]  actually started even before I got here was about the EPA doing medical
[50:39.160 --> 50:42.760]  experiments on people in North Carolina lethal gases exactly what they had said
[50:42.760 --> 50:46.120]  were lethal levels all right we're gonna come back thank you David Knight great
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.560]  job Wednesday I want to hit them hard and she got two days to work on this great

[50:59.200 --> 51:03.520]  oh it's conspiracy theory if you have candida overgrowth just taking
[51:03.520 --> 51:07.200]  antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause
[51:07.200 --> 51:11.960]  candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic damage acidic low oxygen and
[51:11.960 --> 51:15.560]  inflamed tissue environment the goal should be to remove the toxins heal
[51:15.560 --> 51:19.280]  damaged tissues restore healthy pH eliminate inflammation and feed
[51:19.280 --> 51:23.440]  beneficial bacteria previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to
[51:23.440 --> 51:27.620]  mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that
[51:27.620 --> 51:31.520]  make you prone to candida overgrowth removing toxins and healing tissues

[54:24.160 --> 54:28.360]  push to get people to go on strike the mainstream media won't report on it we're
[54:28.360 --> 54:31.960]  getting a lot of emails and intel folks staying at home the lobby Congress and
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.280]  the media to stop West African flights to point out that borders do matter and
[54:37.280 --> 54:41.880]  do do something the White House deleted our petition to stop Ebola that's up on
[54:41.880 --> 54:48.000]  info wars.com claimed it violated terms of service though it didn't I mean we
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  know they don't follow the petitions but they're bully pulpits so that's why we
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.200]  use them kid Daniels wrote about that last night I hadn't reposted the top of
[54:56.200 --> 55:06.840]  info wars.com but the article in question is by Dan Taylor on info wars.com
[55:06.840 --> 55:12.920]  excellent article secret project created weaponized Ebola in South Africa in the
[55:12.920 --> 55:22.120]  1980s and this clip is from BBC News just like we have PBS with the weaponized
[55:22.120 --> 55:28.040]  Ebola here going airborne from 1990 and of course all the top virologists are
[55:28.040 --> 55:32.960]  saying it appears that this strain is beginning to go airborne and there is a
[55:32.960 --> 55:36.800]  top scientist very famous operating out of South Africa during the apartheid era
[55:36.800 --> 55:43.120]  Dr. Wouter Basson launched a secret bio weapons project called Project Coast
[55:43.120 --> 55:48.080]  it's very famous for the informed totally unknown to the unwashed sports fans
[55:48.080 --> 55:55.360]  out there and the US Israel a bunch of others Germany they couldn't produce
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.480]  race-specific weapons in their countries so they had South Africa do it
[56:00.480 --> 56:09.480]  and because most Arabs do have African blood in them they modified the one he
[56:09.480 --> 56:17.280]  was developing as a vaccine that would basically make the body attack sperm a
[56:17.280 --> 56:21.720]  woman's body and this is clearly already in use but he was also producing
[56:21.720 --> 56:25.920]  weaponized Ebola but how dare those Africans that are constantly being
[56:25.920 --> 56:30.440]  tortured constantly being attacked constantly being tested on first but
[56:30.440 --> 56:33.240]  you won't hear that from Jesse Jackson they'll just tell you how those racist
[56:33.240 --> 56:37.200]  white people all day running around no the average white person is not running
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.760]  around racist okay they're a bunch of bleeding heart quits that'll turn their
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.440]  guns in if they're told to because they don't want to be called racist but the
[56:45.440 --> 56:49.280]  people running it at the UN level you better believe they want to kill black
[56:49.280 --> 56:53.920]  people and they want to sterilize them and all this stuff that gets tested on
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.400]  them gets ended up used on everybody so let's go ahead and go to this clip here
[56:58.400 --> 57:03.200]  it is it was a wonderful fellow matters I had to he used to rock up in South
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.120]  Africa having flown in intercontinental flights with a trousers pocket full of
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.680]  goodies in sealed vials that he claimed were new and wonderful organisms and
[57:12.680 --> 57:20.320]  could do the most wonderful things on earth Larry Ford had mutated cholera
[57:20.320 --> 57:25.440]  typhoid anthrax botulism bubonic plague and it also come up with germs that he
[57:25.440 --> 57:31.080]  called kaffa killing germs kaffa as you may know in effort colts is the
[57:31.080 --> 57:36.080]  equivalent of the n-word so these are germs that was specifically engineered
[57:36.080 --> 57:43.360]  to kill only black people in other words an ethnic biological weapon had
[57:43.360 --> 57:51.320]  project coast really gone this far from the beginning this idea of can we find
[57:51.320 --> 57:55.720]  a way to control the size the black population was considered one of the
[57:55.720 --> 58:01.120]  most important areas of research it got even more important over time as the
[58:01.120 --> 58:05.920]  size of the black population and the seriousness of the uprisings increased
[58:05.920 --> 58:14.960]  so there that's one reason why they got into genetic modification research into
[58:14.960 --> 58:23.000]  is there a way to have contraceptives and that could somehow basically
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.600]  sterilize blacks without them knowing it and kind of the whole clips eight
[58:27.600 --> 58:32.040]  minutes long it's up on info wars dot com right now open the international
[58:32.040 --> 58:37.640]  business times made fun of me don't do that I'm gonna fall down and cry oh I'm
[58:37.640 --> 58:41.960]  so scared I got in this to fight bastards you understand that I got in this to
[58:41.960 --> 58:45.440]  stand up for innocence okay and I don't want to hear there too many black people
[58:45.440 --> 58:48.760]  you act like you're a bunch of liberals but you'll wink wink hey let's kill the

[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:25.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.240]  Max Kaiser had technical difficulties he'll be on this later in the week we're
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:39.720]  gonna have Wayne Madsen on to talk about race specific bio weapons the NSA the
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:45.880]  state of Obama's whole movement Democrats are not even filling up halls he
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.200]  comes to speak at and then leaving early Obama makes rare campaign trail
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.600]  appearance people leave early oh they didn't get Valhalla delivered to him on
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:02.440]  a silver platter see I'm against sterilizing the third world populations
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:08.240]  because that's evil but it doesn't mean then that I want to see what's left of
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.760]  the third world population turned against the the West brought in to be
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.040]  turned into socialist to suckle from the same government mammary gland that
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.520]  gives them poison vaccines to be political fodder to take my guns in my
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:28.400]  family comprende I'm against giving all Mexican school age girls the
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.800]  Gardasil shot that sterilizes them in many cases on record it's a soft kill
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.680]  you can't fully kill all their ovaries it'll be too obvious it just reduces
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.120]  fertility kill some people but but it's come out we knew nine years ago it was
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.640]  a bio weapon connected to Bill and Melinda Gates and you know that's come
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.920]  out now a bunch of countries abandoned so I get up here and I don't get praised
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.440]  out the Mexican-American Center that's here in Austin especially a giant
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.120]  Hispanic clan base bashing white people all day and of course if you go to that
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.400]  place you're not gonna hear anything about don't take the Gardasil shot it's
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.360]  all government loves us take the shot yeah I mean this is just it's so
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.440]  frustrating to have the new Black Panther Party saying they hate the cracker head
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.880]  Alex Jones because I don't want to kill all the black people but I don't embrace
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.800]  all their baloney and then I get to have a subsection of Hispanic folks funded
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.280]  by big corporations into their own race-based group with the big Ford
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.400]  Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funding them and see the
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.560]  Mexicans they can't sterilize or kill and give them vaccines to cause pancreatitis
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.400]  so they become diabetic and their legs get sought off see I have empathy and
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:37.920]  don't want all the Mexicans down their legs sought off because I'm a racist see
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.120]  if I would just act trendy and liberal and go oh I love everything oh open
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.440]  borders are good then I could like secretly go to cocktail parties and
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.240]  talk about how much I hate minorities but because I don't hate minorities which
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:58.480]  are the majority worldwide I'm evil see I get attacked by the ADL because I
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.000]  fight Nazism and show that our government helped fund it and brought a
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.040]  bunch of them over here just like everybody else it fights Nazis gets
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.640]  attacked by the ADL now if you're actually a Nazi collaborator that helped
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.320]  round up thousands of people and is proud of it and does 60 minutes interviews
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.160]  about it George Soros you get awards if you are known to wear Nazi uniforms and
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.760]  how Hitler and hand out Hitler speeches on records and tell Rolling Stone you
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:29.400]  want to be like hit Hitler then you get awards from the ADL your Arnold
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.480]  Schwarzenegger I just want to point that out that I just admit it I'm a
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.160]  horrible person because I want to live and let live and work for everybody to
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.560]  have a better future and I don't want to kill all the black people and I don't
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.200]  want to sterilize them and I don't want to give them age and I don't want to give
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.560]  them Ebola and I don't want to kill the Hispanics and I don't want to kill the
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.040]  Asians and I don't want to kill the white people and I don't want to hear I'm
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.200]  inherently bad because I'm European and I'm sick of hearing you know anything
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.320]  that white culture being demonized and attacked the globalist or scientific
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.800]  they're playing us all off against each other and it's a giant joke that's why
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:10.560]  I want to throw up when I see Al Sharpton FBI informant it's always the same

[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.200]  threatening judges and you know all this stuff and I knew he was a Fed and when
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.920]  hackers got into his email and proved he was a Fed the feds set him up and put
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.120]  him in prison even though it came out in the trial in Illinois that he was an
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.400]  FBI national security asset so that's what you guys get to work for the system

[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.520]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.560]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.400]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.640]  90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.800]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.560]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.920]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.600]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:19.200]  against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:26.200]  the military industry shut your mouth Eisenhower. Traitor. I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assessment.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:32.200]  Yeah. Order all those assembled. Only left the illegal military mission in
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.600]  north st. Louis heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.000]  alarmed if you see there's no police say common Alex rolling through your
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.960]  neighborhood. Oh we were right about that again. Military helicopter is flying low over Minneapolis.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.960]  Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. No one will be able to be on. We will take all weapons. Oh.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.640]  Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in. Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns and
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:59.960]  advanced. Nobody wants your guns. Enough. Enough. Enough. Just turn them in. The Department of Homeland
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.960]  Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying screen. Now two plus billion. It comes out to like 1.6 billion
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:11.960]  rounds of ammunition. NSK SLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.960]  with potentially their biggest problem. Oh. We have to break through our kind of
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.960]  private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their family.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.960]  Yeah. Recognize that kids belong to whole communities. Everything's fine. Business. You didn't build that.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:29.960]  Yeah. There's nothing creepy here. Somebody else made that happen. It's not in trouble. I'm sorry.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.960]  Containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies. Yeah. That's right.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.960]  That's fine. Government's good. Choppers soaring to the night sky but this is only a dream.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:45.960]  And they try to take on the tea party. Officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960]  Yeah.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:58.960]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police also military.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:05.960]  I am in my apartment. I am inside. I have two words for you. Predator gloves.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:13.960]  You will never see it. The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.960]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.960]  and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.960]  They let them in the area. They don't have the freedom of the parade.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.960]  Again like their trespassers punching and shoving people.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:37.960]  We're turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to commentate.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:47.960]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run live from the info wars dot com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.960]  I love how the power structure is always threatening me and stuff saying you know we can come after you.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.960]  You know we can set you up.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.960]  Don't they get it? I know that. I'm here to fight. I'm here to take the Republic back.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.960]  For the disastrous rise of misplaced...
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.960]  Yeah, let Eisenhower finish up and we'll persist.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:13.960]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.960]  I am your host Alex Jones. I want to take your phone calls ahead of Wayne Madsen joining us for two segments.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.960]  Then when he leaves it'll be open phones the third hour as well.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:28.960]  Wanted Ebola screeners at JFK for $19 an hour. How would you like that job with all those West African flights coming in?
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.960]  You know people dying of vomiting fits but everything's okay they say.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.960]  Meanwhile the White House has deleted our petition to stop Ebola.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.960]  That's up on info wars dot com and prisonpana.com.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.960]  I want to hear from you on the Ebola front.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.960]  But what else are they distracting us from right now with the Ebola news?
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.960]  First time callers 800 it'll be free for all in the third hour.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:06.960]  800-259-9231-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air on this live Monday edition.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.960]  Speaking of the White House then I'll get back into this article.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.960]  Secret project created weaponized Ebola in South Africa in the 1980s.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.960]  The South African government declassified.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.960]  Oh but the International Business Times says we're conspiracy theorists for saying it.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.960]  We're not allowed to link to BBC TV specials.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:32.960]  We're not allowed to link to Nova specials about airborne Ebola in the US.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.960]  We're not allowed to be informed. We're not allowed to be smart.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.960]  We're not allowed to be aggressive. We're not allowed to be unapologetic.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:43.960]  We're supposed to just cower and go your mainstream media even though you have a smaller audience than us.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:49.960]  Sir, you're your mainstream. You're the boss. I'll do what you say.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.960]  Please don't have the White House run media matters with almost no traffic.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.960]  With admitted White House talking points come out and call me deranged.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.960]  I'm deranged waking people up and ringing the alarm bell.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.960]  And warning people like Paul Revere and trying to spur other Paul Revere's to take action.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.960]  And you're upset about that.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.960]  There it is. Deranged right-wing conspiracy theory.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.960]  Obama intentionally wants to infect the nation with Ebola.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.960]  Well that's what they're doing.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.960]  And now they've got polls out saying most Americans are saying the same thing.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.960]  That was from a few weeks ago.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.960]  White House deletes petition to stop Ebola.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.960]  I've called for a strike to start this week for people to build it up right through the week
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.960]  until they shut down those West African flights that Columbia and England
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.960]  and Central South America, Europe, Asian countries have done months ago.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.960]  Columbia last week and others. But we won't do it.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.960]  We'll have a $19 an hour person sit there with a thermometer.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.960]  White House deletes petition to stop Ebola.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:07.960]  The White House over the weekend deleted a petition demanding President Obama do more to stop the spread of Ebola in the U.S.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.960]  The Obama administration said the petition which urged the White House to take proper action to fight Ebola
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.960]  was removed from WhiteHouse.gov because it violated the terms of participation.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:23.960]  See, you two only had to have $10,000, then it was $25,000, then $100,000 for them to officially respond.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.960]  We got like a million or something on the Piers Morgan one.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.960]  So they responded and said that it wasn't serious.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.960]  Because they define reality. Remember what Carl Rove said.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:38.960]  The petition you are trying to access has been removed from the site under our moderation policy
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.960]  because it is in violation of our terms of participation, the White House stated.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.960]  While you can't sign the petition, there may be other petitions on We the People,
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.960]  on a similar issue that we like to add your name to.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.960]  See, they want to act like they got the idea from petitions when they felt like it to do something.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.960]  Like, oh, there's a petition to ban guns. Yes, we'll follow that.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960]  We'll try to implement that.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.960]  There's a petition to shut down power plants or there's a petition to teach every religion
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.960]  but Christianity in school. We'll be sure and do that.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.960]  There's a petition to support Michelle telling your kids what to eat.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:14.960]  But oh, there's a petition to deport Piers Morgan because he's involved as a foreign power
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.960]  trying to destroy our bill of rights.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.960]  We're going to ignore that or we're going to say it's not serious.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.960]  Well, now they'll just remove it because we use it as a bully pulpit
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.960]  to show how they're not doing their job.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.960]  Of course, nowhere in the First Amendment does it state citizens
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.960]  can only petition the government for a redress of grievance
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.960]  if they accept terms and conditions written by the White House.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960]  Good job, Kit Daniels, making that point.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.960]  So by removing the petition, it appears the Obama administration
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.960]  is more interested in controlling the narrative surrounding the Ebola pandemic
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.960]  than actually stopping the disease.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.960]  For one thing, Obama refuses to ban travel from Ebola-struck African countries
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.960]  despite Marine General John Kelly warning the outbreak in Africa
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.960]  could lead to mass migration into the U.S. of those infected with Ebola seeking treatment.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.960]  Well, they didn't like the fact that was on our petition.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.960]  It was that our petition was so hard-hitting, so common sense, so bibliographed,
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.960]  so you just had all the proof in the pudding.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.960]  That's why they call it conspiracy theorists because they can't argue with us.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.960]  Oh, here's the BBC News clip and here's the links to South African news
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.960]  and the biggest African newspaper with virologists saying they believe this is man-made,
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.960]  a white virologist, by the way.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.960]  They're always like, oh, that's just a black scientist.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.960]  We need to listen to them.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.960]  We're liberals, but I mean, African scientists saying our government will do something.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.960]  I mean, they've just been caught hundreds of times in major projects in tetanus shots
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.960]  and other things sterilizing African women or the UN caught giving them HIV and vaccines.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.960]  That even came out in the BBC years ago.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.960]  They said it was an accident, though.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.960]  I mean, imagine the Africans not trusting the West and Bill and Melinda Gates
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.960]  that openly talk about how they want to reduce population.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.960]  I mean, what's wrong with them?
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.960]  They should be more trusting, shouldn't they?
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.960]  Well, our leaders over here control.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.960]  I don't care what color they are, but in Africa, they're not.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.960]  They'll go out and tell the truth in many cases.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.960]  And it just goes on to show how they banned that.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:19.960]  And of course, what did CNN, MSNBC, Media Matters?
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.960]  We were literally rated thousands of percentage points above Media Matters, thousands and thousands,
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.960]  thousands as well above MSNBC.com, and the rest are just rising.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.960]  You know, bigger than Breitbart, WorldNet Daily, all of it.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.960]  But Breitbart, WorldNet Daily, Drudge Report, Drudge, of course, many, many times,
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.960]  probably 50 times bigger than us on total visits.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:43.960]  But the point is, is they banned him as well.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.960]  They just basically showed Alexa last week nose diving.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.960]  Every socialist or communist or globalist site skyrocketing.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.960]  Every site that isn't completely socialist.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.960]  I mean, there's even mild sites like Breitbart that they just basically said don't exist anymore.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.960]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.960]  Our advertisers know they get big responses.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.960]  And Alexa's internal algorithm that you can subscribe to shows were exploding.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.960]  But for the public, they put out that we have basically no visitors now.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.960]  Of course, internally, Media Matters and MSNBC are imploding right now.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.960]  You can go subscribe for pennies, you know, and basically look at Alexa and see their internal numbers.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960]  It doesn't matter though, for everybody else, it's just we don't exist.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960]  They announced we don't exist.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.960]  They announced that we have no viewers or listeners.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.960]  And so they are God, according to Carl Rove.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.960]  Remember, under Bush, he told the New York Times, they control reality.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.960]  They are history's actors.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.960]  And when government makes an announcement, they could claim that England doesn't exist next week.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.960]  And they would say that was the truth, or that two plus two equals five.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.960]  They may suspend the laws of gravity.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.960]  Gravity will still be there, but their acolytes will follow it.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.960]  So this is a cult.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:56.960]  These people are a cult of weirdos who basically get their free paychecks and their free government and corporate jobs
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.960]  and just sit around all day as they defraud everyone and as the economy collapses
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.960]  and as they parasitically shut down the economy they don't control greedily and kill the golden goose.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.960]  And we sit here and say, our kids belong to us.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.960]  And we have a right to defend ourselves.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960]  And we have a right to petition.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.960]  No, you don't. You don't exist. You're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.960]  That's our label. Everything you say doesn't matter.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:30.960]  Well, the badge of deranged or right wing or extreme or conspiracy theorist or dangerous is a badge of honor.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:37.960]  And so being demonized by you ne'er-do-wells and by you camp followers and by you establishment lax,
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:48.960]  lackey sycophant, phony intellectual, grand-faluning, butt-headed morons
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.960]  is the great certification of victory.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:57.960]  So continue to hate the medals upon my chest as we begin to wake up more people.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.960]  See how delusional you are? You certify us.

[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.960]  and in a word the answer is protection.

[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.960]  pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell and all forms of fluoride.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.960]  Plus Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system

[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.960]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:07.960]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.960]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.960]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.960]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:20.960]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.960]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:30.960]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.960]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:38.960]  And that's why I stock MyPatriot with high-quality, storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.

[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.960]  Mike Stenerson from MyTis Resources.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.960]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important,
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.960]  certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.960]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.960]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960]  Ours is not immune.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.960]  The time is now to be proactive.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:24.960]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.960]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:32.960]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.960]  So decide.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.960]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960]  The choice is yours.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:43.960]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.960]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.960]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.960]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:04.960]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:11.960]  Pentagon says Ebola strike team does not violate Posse Commentatus.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.960]  Military argues Posse Commentatus is irrelevant and dangerous.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.960]  Well, I'm not against the military responding to Ebola,
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.960]  but saying it's irrelevant and dangerous is outrageous
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960]  and it's basically been overturned.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.960]  And that is a big issue.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.960]  And the military is concerned with it themselves.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.960]  That's coming up.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960]  We're going to continue with your calls here.
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.960]  Start going to those in a minute.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.960]  Also, we have a report by John Bowne about the World Health Organization
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.960]  admitting that 12% of people incubated for 42 days, not 21.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.960]  So that's double.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.960]  And they could live 70 days in sperm.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960]  This is a big deal.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.960]  So that's coming up right before we talk to Wayne Madsen.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.960]  After Madsen's gone, next hour, I'll get to everybody.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.960]  Red Diamond, you're on the air from Texas.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.960]  Go ahead.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:01.960]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960]  I'm such a racist.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960]  I have a flag on my porch.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.960]  The flag has 13 stripes, seven red and six white.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960]  And there's 50 stars on the flag.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:14.960]  I look at it every day and I think about the states.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.960]  And as far as I'm concerned, I think the states need to kind of step in
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:23.960]  and make sure this government of ours that's out of hand doesn't get out of hand.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:30.960]  What can we do to pressure our representatives to kind of, you know,
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.960]  make sure that stuff doesn't get out of hand?
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.960]  Rick Perry could send the state police in to look at manifestos of major airports
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.960]  that have West Africans coming in off connections and do the screening right there
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.960]  just as a stunt to basically point out the feds aren't doing their job.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:51.960]  There's stuff you can do like that, or the governors could call Obama out,
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:55.960]  which Rick Perry's finally done, but he should do it at a press conference
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.960]  and say, look, it's your job, the fed's job to keep contagions,
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.960]  enemies foreign and domestic from getting into the country.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.960]  This is a federal job to keep contagions out with the Coast Guard and with the Navy
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.960]  and at the ports of entry, which means airports as well under common law of the Constitution.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:21.960]  So that's what they need to do. But again, it's sending Ebola patients to regular hospitals.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.960]  That's a no-no. Why'd they do that?
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.960]  Why are they doing all these things because they want it to spread?
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.960]  Good point. It's good to hear from you. John in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:32.960]  Hello, Alex.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.960]  Hey, brother.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:38.960]  First off, I'd like to tell you how pleased I am with a crystal-quest showerhead
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.960]  that I purchased a year ago. Showers feel good.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  Well, thank you. Yes, we do. We do sell showerheads, very inexpensive, high quality
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.960]  that cut out a lot of the fluoride and other things in your showers.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.960]  It's what I use for my children in my home. But thank you.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:57.960]  We basically sell whatever I use and like whenever I think's good.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.960]  It doesn't mean I always have all the answers, but that's the kind of products we sell.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960]  Go ahead. Sorry.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.960]  I've got another order coming up through your store shortly,
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.960]  but I want to discuss freedom of speech.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:16.960]  I posted your petition to the White House by way of a comment to another website on Facebook.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:17.960]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:26.960]  And I challenged all the other contributors to the commentary columns to participate.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:32.960]  And I even included a letter to a specific individual whom you know.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.960]  I won't name them unless you ask me to. And when I woke up earlier this morning,
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:43.960]  it was all gone and I'm barred from that Facebook page.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.960]  And I think that's very hypocritical.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.960]  Did Facebook bar you or did the person's page bar you?
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:54.960]  I can't say for sure, but I have contacted the administrators of the page
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.960]  and I'm not getting any reply.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.960]  Well, I'll tell you what happens. Every time something starts going viral, they block it.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.960]  The White House took our petition down. They put it up Friday.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.960]  I looked at it Friday night and had like 10,000 signatures.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.960]  I don't know what it had by yesterday afternoon when we got emails.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.960]  It was down and they said we took it down because we don't agree with it.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.960]  Basically, it violates our terms of service.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:23.960]  They don't say specifically what it was that we dare lobby to keep something out of the country that kills 70% of people.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:29.960]  AP reports other African countries banned flights and blocked their borders two months ago.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.960]  But we can't do it. Africans can do the common sense thing, but we can't.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960]  And it just shows how they flaunt this on our face.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.960]  Thank you for the information, John, and thank you for the support.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  Let's talk to Eddie in New York. You're on the air. Eddie, go ahead.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.960]  Yes, sir. I wanted to speak about the Ebola situation.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960]  Go ahead.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.960]  Yeah, I was just saying that especially with the tyranny and stuff that's going on,
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.960]  they're attacking us on all fronts right now.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.960]  This is a full front to assault.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.960]  They cannot attack us through the Ebola with a medical tourney.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960]  They're attacking us through our borders.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.960]  They're attacking us with ISIS on the other side of the world. They have us surrounded.
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.960]  That's right. The globalists are pulling out all the stops.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.960]  And I think this is only the beginning. What do you think the next shoot-a-drops is going to be?
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.960]  I really don't know. You don't really get all the pieces of the puzzle.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:19.960]  We kind of have to sit there and watch what they do and predict what's going to come next.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:22.960]  But I feel the reason why they have this all set up so this way,
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.960]  if they can use any one of these crises to take away our rights,
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.960]  they have it all set up so this way, if they want to go through the Ebola,
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.960]  they want to use the border.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.960]  I agree with you. Don't hang up. I'm going to go to you with Wayne Madsen
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.960]  and you can make this point, expand on it and get his take.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.960]  Coming up, I'll go to you. Coming up, Eddie, don't hang up.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.960]  And then Lona, Daniel, Charlie and many others stay with us.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.960]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.960]  800-25-99-231.
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:53.960]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:30:19.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:28.960]  We're on the run.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:57.960]  Our call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:26.960]  DNA Force from Infowars Life.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:37.960]  We're on the run.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.960]  888-253-3139.
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.960]  Another major health threat.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:05.960]  This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.960]  has been told not to drink the water.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.960]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:16.960]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.960]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.960]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.960]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:32.960]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.960]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.960]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:46.960]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern independently minded household.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.960]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:56.960]  Go to infowarstore.com today to purchase your Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:21.960]  Or call 1-88-253-3139.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.960]  Bottom line, I want to live free. I want you to live free.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:39.960]  When I even imagine in my mind joining the globalists and praying on other people and being part of the secret sterilization programs going on,
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:47.960]  my soul shudders as I think about being damned to hell if I was ever part of something like that or abortion or any of it.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:52.960]  And I'm not judging people that were part of bad things on accident who were deceived,
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:59.960]  but to have the knowledge of good and evil, to know what's bad, to know what's corrupt, to know what's anti-human,
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:04.960]  and then to decide to join with it like the UN and others have done.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.960]  If you just joined us, I'm going to bring this up with one of the biggest NSA whistleblowers ever.
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.960]  One of the first, Wayne Madsen.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:17.960]  We've got William Benny, former head of their internal operations, a director of the NSA going public,
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:21.960]  saying it's a total tyranny takeover, pointed at the general public.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.960]  We have AT&T execs going public, saying the NSA hubs are inside.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:34.960]  We have, of course, folks that have run off to other countries and run off to Russia like Snowden.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:42.960]  But Madsen is really the original guy that testified to the EU parliament, the British parliament, to Congress and others
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.960]  who really knows how deep the rabbit hole goes from day one.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.960]  The Clearinghouse, even had to leave the US last year for a while because they're no kidding.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.960]  He was told by high-level sources, had a hit team out to kill him.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.960]  But then that contract expired.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:05.960]  I want to talk to him briefly today, but you can go a little bit in the next hour also about has he seen kill the messenger with Gary Webb?
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.960]  I knew Gary Webb well, interviewed him many times.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.960]  We were going to build a website together when his new book came out.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.960]  He said his home was being broken into, and then they killed him.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.960]  And I was very pleased to see the film and they implied that they killed him at the end.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.960]  They don't go with the baloney line.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.960]  The family was threatened to shut up when it all happened.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.960]  I don't want to be shot in the head twice.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.960]  You know, if they kill me, I'm not looking forward to it, but that's part of standing up against these people.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.960]  That's part of being a warrior. I'm ready for it.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.960]  I don't look forward to it, don't like it, but the only way you don't have fear is just to side and you're already dead.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:46.960]  What I do care about, though, is not letting them lie and say that I killed myself.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.960]  Torturing me to fill out a thing or threatening to kill my kids, all that stuff.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.960]  I don't know what I'd do if they were threatened to kill my kids if I didn't fill out the suicide note.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:58.960]  That's what they do, but I've just gotten myself ready for that.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.960]  I'm not trying to be theatrical.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.960]  They killed over a million Iraqis, the globalists did.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.960]  They have been killed in the global world.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.960]  They have torture camps everywhere.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.960]  They just want to sell us on going along with it.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.960]  And I'm going to get into this with Wayne Madsen.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:17.960]  Secret project created weaponized Ebola in South Africa in the 1980s.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.960]  And I'm so glad that Dan Taylor, who's an amazing writer and who runs Old Thinker News.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.960]  Be sure and check that out.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.960]  We publish this stuff at infowars.com.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  Republish it.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:36.960]  Went back because I totally forgotten about all these South African scientists on record
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:43.960]  where they were working with the U.S., Israel and Europe to create race specific bio weapons to target blacks and then Arabs.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:49.960]  He has successfully created one that would kill in black women.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.960]  It would trigger in black women.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:59.960]  It would have some effect on whites, but a more powerful effect on black women to create an autoimmune response to sperm.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.960]  And of course, it also causes inflammation and problems in the women every time that would happen.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  And it causes endobetiorgosis, so it's also a soft kill.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:12.960]  Just like the African tetanus shot had the female hormone that's secreted in second trimester.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.960]  That's released.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.960]  And then once that's released, it causes an autoimmune response in the ovaries in the uterus as well.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.960]  It doesn't just kill the baby.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:25.960]  They have a miscarriage at second trimester at the fourth month every time.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.960]  By the fourth month, it also tends to kill the woman.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.960]  All this was declassified.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.960]  And I totally forgotten.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:36.960]  Okay, yeah, you know all the secret testing in Africa.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.960]  Well, that's not enough to just say that.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:43.960]  You've got to go back to why they have top newspapers over there saying they believe the Ebola virus was souped up.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.960]  Secret project created weaponized Ebola in South Africa in the 1980s.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.960]  And this story links to mainstream newscast about it in the BBC and others.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:01.960]  Operating out of South Africa during the apartheid era in the 1980s, Dr. Wouter Basin wants a secret bio weapons project called Project Coast.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:02.960]  Race specific.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:10.960]  I remember a project for the American Century document published in 2000 in the Austin American statesman.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:14.960]  Calling for the legitimate use of race specific bio weapons.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.960]  To just see what the public would do.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.960]  Now the statesman editorial staff is the only paper I've ever seen do it.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.960]  They fired back the next week.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.960]  You can pull this up.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.960]  You can find it on LexisNexis or Google.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.960]  It's like 14 years old.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.960]  Just type in, I'm going to go to Wayne.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:34.960]  I'm kind of wound up here.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:39.960]  And the statesman decried the call for race specific bio weapons.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.960]  That's the same group that called for staging terror attacks to bring in martial law.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.960]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.960]  Now briefly, you're watching me on TV.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.960]  You notice this isn't just pure water, filtered water.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.960]  It's also got the survival shield X2 in it.
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.960]  The super male vitality.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.960]  The silver bullet colloidal silver.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.960]  And the secret sauce that should be here in the next month.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.960]  I'll just tell you this.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.960]  It's a very well known vitamin that isn't very absorbable by mouth or even under the tongue.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.960]  But is by injection.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.960]  We're coming out with something.
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:17.960]  We're going to publish the documents on this and things that is a higher level absorption that you take as a liquid.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.960]  Very special form of this.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:25.960]  And it's secret where we're having to get it trademarked and looking at patenting it and things.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:29.960]  But the point is that this is going to be called secret something.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  I'm not going to tell you what it is yet, obviously.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.960]  But your purchases support the broadcast.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.960]  Whether it's the oxy powder that just get a bottle.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.960]  You're supporting the broadcast and just see what it does for you, flushing out your guts.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:45.960]  Nothing like it that I've ever taken before.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:46.960]  I've done some cleanses before.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:47.960]  Just nothing like it.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.960]  It's over the top.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.960]  Just try a bottle.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.960]  I know you'll be a repeat customer and support the broadcast.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.960]  But most importantly, support your immune system and your body's natural ability to fight things off.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:03.960]  DNA force, survival shield X2 is just as important in my medicine cabinet for the body's natural defenses
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.960]  as colloidal silver, maybe even more.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.960]  Fluoride shield for chelating, detoxifying.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:15.960]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.960]  Infowarslife.com, the very cutting edge of nutraceuticals.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:26.960]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:33.960]  Now, John Bowne has a report that we're going to post on Infowars.com the next 20 minutes.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:40.960]  And next hour, I'll premiere it here on the radio dealing with the fact that the CDC is now saying
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:43.960]  Ebola is now living 42 days, not 21.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.960]  The tales of that coming up.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:51.960]  But Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com, author, researcher, journalist.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:58.960]  He broke the DC Madame story, got her on the show right before they killed her, speaking of that.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:00.960]  So this is very serious when I talk about death threats.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.960]  And there's a reason Glenn Beck now has a security team of 50 people.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.960]  He's given into the fear.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.960]  And I feel so sorry for him.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.960]  I won't do that.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.960]  It's all in God's hands.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:15.960]  But the system is threatening and doing a lot of dirty tricks right now.
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.960]  They got people in government, out of government.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:18.960]  It's amazing.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:19.960]  They're making their move.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.960]  Don't let that intimidate you.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:25.960]  If you're low level fighting the tyrants, you're under the radar in my experience.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.960]  It can do devastating damage in the Info War.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.960]  So don't let their intimidation work on you.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.960]  I don't talk a lot about this stuff because I don't want to do their work for them.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.960]  But I believe you're not cowards and will take action and get prepared to speak out.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.960]  But the enemy is moving on all fronts.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.960]  Wayne Madsen, where would you say we're historically right now?
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.960]  A, and then B, I want to look at Ebola.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.960]  Because we've got an International Business Times article, CBS, you name it,
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.960]  are attacking us that we dare say that it could be made to buy a weapon lab.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.960]  When the West has admittedly been weaponizing Ebola, not just South Africa,
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.960]  I mean, we'd have to be crazy not to at least look at that.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:04.960]  So what's your take on Ebola?
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.960]  And then we'll move into a lot of other areas.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:07.960]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.960]  Okay, Alex. Good to see you again.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.960]  Hear you again.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:14.960]  But anyway, I have a story up today on Ebola.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.960]  If we remember, the first outbreak of Ebola was in 1976,
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.960]  and then Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.960]  If you remember, back then, the news reports at the time,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.960]  including the, you know, CBS, NBC ABC all said,
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:38.960]  this is a terrible disease. It causes the organs in the body to turn into a gelified mass.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  It's 88% fatal.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.960]  There were outbreaks at first in southern Sudan and then in Zaire.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.960]  Then we were told that it was contained in these hot zones.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:57.960]  It was even a movie made about it with Dustin Hoppin called the Hot Zone,
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:03.960]  about the outbreak of this hemorrhagic fever in rest in Virginia.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.960]  There actually is a rest in form of the Ebola virus,
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.960]  but it's supposedly the least harmful.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.960]  But it is airborne if that's the one that got out in 89.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:19.960]  The original World Health Organization reports out of Zaire in 1976 said
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.960]  it could be transmitted by airborne means.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.960]  That's not me saying that that's the World Health Organization.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:32.960]  But remember, in 1976, the CIA, then headed by George H.W. Bush,
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.960]  was fighting a legal war in Angola using Zaire as a base.
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:43.960]  Zaire became a major CIA base, not only for supporting the guerrillas
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.960]  fighting the government in Angola,
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:51.960]  but also helping the southern Sudanese rebels against the government in Khartoum.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:58.960]  So Zaire was a major, turned into a major petri dish for Dr. Sidney Gottlieb,
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:04.960]  who was the CIA's Dr. Frankenstein, more like Dr. Strangelove,
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.960]  who came out with all these diseases that would attack humans,
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.960]  crops, and animals.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:14.960]  And then there was even cross-species jumping from animals to humans.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.960]  And imagine how bad it is now with all the DNA and RNA control they have.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:21.960]  And that's exactly what the South African press, mainline press,
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.960]  reported that was declassified in these hearings in the 90s.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:29.960]  And that's who Wuder Basin worked for, was just a front for the CIA.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.960]  And let's not forget Israel.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:34.960]  Israel has admitted to some of the fact of working with him.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:37.960]  And Wade, you mentioned Basin, Project Coast.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:41.960]  He was Gottlieb's South African counterpart.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:47.960]  And Basin, remember Stephen Hatfield was identified as a person of interest
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.960]  in the anthrax, a postal mailing incident.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:58.960]  And the FBI sent teams to South Africa and Zimbabwe to investigate Hatfield's role
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.960]  in helping the Rhodesians sell us scouts, again, in the 1970s.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:06.960]  In the same timeframe, we had the Ebola outbreak in Zaire,
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  and also South Africa's BioWare programs.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.960]  And in South Africa, it was Project Coast headed up by Basin.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:16.960]  And then the word is, by the 80s for nuke technology,
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.960]  we know South Africa got nukes right before the,
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.960]  they traded race bio weapons to Israel for the nukes.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.960]  Absolutely.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:30.960]  So yeah, that was an unholy alliance between Israel and South African.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.960]  And also the CIA and Rhodesia to basically foment these
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:43.960]  and support these civil wars in places like Rhodesia and Angola
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.960]  and Southwest Africa.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:50.960]  And also they were active in Zaire and Southern Sudan.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:54.960]  You know, so there was a reason we saw the first Ebola outbreaks
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.960]  in Southern Sudan and Zaire because that's where the agency was active
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:02.960]  in using these countries and these poor people
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.960]  who had no idea what was happening to them as petri dishes.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.960]  Now the charge that people got this from eating bush meat,
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.960]  I think that's a pejorative comment by people trying to say,
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.960]  oh well, it's those Africans eating fruit bats
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.960]  and dead animals they find on the ground.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.960]  I think it's racist to suggest that because the first person
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:27.960]  who contracted Ebola in Southern Sudan in 1976 was a cotton factory worker.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.960]  He had a middle management job.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.960]  He was educated.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.960]  And the second person in Zaire was a school headmaster.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.960]  So to suggest that these people were somehow living off the land,
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:41.960]  I think was ridiculous.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.960]  I think the CIA put that information out to basically,
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.960]  you mentioned that kill the messenger movie.
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:51.960]  Well, they were trying to kill the first victims of Ebola by characters.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960]  Elaine, what's amazing about you,
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.960]  and I'm just pointing this out for listeners.
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:56.960]  I hope they realize what they're hearing.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.960]  I've done deep research into this.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.960]  And it doesn't matter what subject I bring up,
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.960]  you've done just as deep or more and without notes
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.960]  are just spouting all the data.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.960]  I mean, I just don't know how you've done so much research.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.960]  It really is amazing and always great to have you on as an analyst.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.960]  I think we need to hire you as a routine correspondent,
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:17.960]  at least part time.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960]  That's all I've got in the budget.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.960]  I know you were here last year.
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:20.960]  We were talking about that.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.960]  But I got caught up in other stuff and had some funding issues.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.960]  We're doing better right now.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:31.960]  I mean, just there's so much that you know what's your gut on this Ebola
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:32.960]  and where it's going.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.960]  What do you think it's really all about?
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:38.960]  I'm suspicious where we have the outbreak this time in Guinea,
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.960]  Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  These three countries are very, very rich in natural resources,
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.960]  especially gold, diamonds, and iron ore in Guinea.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:55.960]  The first case in Guinea was very close to this Simindu mining track,
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:00.960]  which was actually long sought after by the richest guy in Israel
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.960]  named Benny Steinmetz, who actually tried to foment a coup d'etat
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:09.960]  when he had his mining rights stripped from him by the government of Guinea
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.960]  because he was caught trying to overthrow the government.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.960]  So they reacted and said, look, you're not going to do business here anymore.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:20.960]  And the FBI put Steinmetz under investigation for violating the Foreign
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:24.960]  Corrupt Practices Act because he was accused of paying bribes to the
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.960]  previous government of Guinea.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.960]  The new government, President Khande, basically canceled all the agreements
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:31.960]  with Steinmetz.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.960]  And I find it very interesting that the first Ebola case in Guinea,
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:42.960]  which is the very deadly Zaire strain, not the other less harmful strains
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:49.960]  like the Thai forest strain from Ivory Coast or the Sudan strain,
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:56.960]  that it struck very close to this iron mine track, the Simindu track in Guinea.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.960]  And then that was the tri-border area of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:06.960]  And it didn't take long for it to cross that very porous border
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:10.960]  and then hit major metropolitan areas, the capitals of Liberia,
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.960]  Monrovia, and also Freetown, the capital Sierra Leone.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:19.960]  The only other time there was an outbreak in a metropolitan area was in
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:24.960]  the Leverville, the capital of Gabon in 2002, but that was quickly isolated.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:30.960]  So this is the first time we've seen Ebola hit major metropolitan areas,
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:35.960]  Monrovia and Freetown, which allowed it to spread first to Nigeria,
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:40.960]  to Lagos, and also then to Europe and the United States.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:43.960]  Premier Research, do you think it is a souped up strain
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:47.960]  or are they just letting it spread? And then B, why are they letting it spread?
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.960]  Clearly the default is let it spread, not just in Africa, but here. What's happening?
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:58.960]  Well, I think there may be some truth to the fact that this was yet the use of Africa.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:05.960]  Not as a petri dish like they used Zaire that just tested out on a human population in 76.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:12.960]  And then we had outbreaks periodically in Zaire and the neighboring Republic of Congo after that.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:20.960]  But I think this is basically, this is destroyed basically the public health infrastructures
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.960]  of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. A number of government workers have died from Ebola,
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:33.960]  and we even have heard the leaders of those countries say that it's going to have a long-term effect.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:39.960]  Sure, clearly they use Alcatra to destabilize the Middle East, they use Ebola to destabilize the countries
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.960]  and aren't giving all the resources up for nothing. And they have major newspapers with
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.960]  virologists saying it's been cooked up, and then our media makes fun of it.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:52.960]  When Africa has been hit by secret biological testing and it's been declassified,
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.960]  it's like your next-door neighbors robbed you once, you get robbed again, they're the main suspect.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:15.960]  You'd have to be insane not to think it could be staged.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.960]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:00.960]  It's here, only at BlockItPocket.com.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:36.960]  I'm watching and waiting for the right time to take everything you own. I love a dark house.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:03.960]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:07.960]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:12.960]  30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply,
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:20.960]  resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits. While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology,

[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:06.960]  Aging starts at the cellular level. When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:11.960]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:18.960]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth and rejuvenation.
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:28.960]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:30.960]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:41.960]  DNA force, just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:44.960]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:49.960]  The ultimate value, cutting edge trailblazing game changer that also supports the InfoWars.
[02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:57.960]  Secure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:57.960 --> 02:31:59.960]  DNA force from InfoWarslife.
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:46.960]  We turned genes inside out. Diamond gusset genes, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:52.960]  Our Defender motorcycle genes combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:59.960]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset genes, got it. Others don't.
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:28.960]  We're going to finish up with Charlie and all the callers that are there, Sean and others.
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:33.960]  Wayne Madsen is our guest. I do have John Bowne's report. We haven't aired yet as well.
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:39.960]  We'll get to that on Ebola. The CDC now announcing him last 41 days in a certain percentage of people.
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:41.960]  This is getting crazy, clearly mutating.
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:49.960]  We are carrying a new film that's exclusively available for the next few weeks only at infowars.com.
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:52.960]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:59.960]  There's no place like Utopia, a Joel Gilbert film that's even more powerful than Dinesh D'Souza's new film
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:04.960]  and more to the base of showing what collectivism is really all about, total social control.
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:09.960]  They take the good idea of helping poor people and turning them into a system of actually enslaving.
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:13.960]  Very powerful film. There's no place like Utopia and it's not pre-order.
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:19.960]  It's shipping now for $14.95 and your purchase supports Joel Gilbert and the Infowars operation.
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:29.960]  There's no place like Utopia available at infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:37.960]  Don't forget we have the Made in America Ebola shirts that equate Obama with the disease of tyranny.
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:40.960]  Very effective. Those are selling out very quickly.
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:44.960]  If you want to get those, but the blood splatter one and the regular one, it's fake blood folks.
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:48.960]  Then we also have the Molon Lombay come and take it shirts and a bunch of different designs
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:51.960]  and also a tight fitting one with gold foil for women.
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:55.960]  I think it's one of the best looking women's second amendment shirts out there.
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:00.960]  That's it. Made in 1776.com or infowarsstore.com.
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:03.960]  Made in 1776.com is a subdivision of that.
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:11.960]  Just like infowarslife.com is just a sub area of infowarsstore.com with the very best bar none
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:13.960]  in my view supplements out there.
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:19.960]  We set out where other supplement makers will spend $2 on a product and sell it for $30.
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:23.960]  I'll spend $18 on a product and sell it for $30.
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:26.960]  Or we'll spend $10 on a product and sell it for $25.
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:28.960]  Still a markup. Still funds our operation.
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:32.960]  But we go to some of the biggest, most respected manufacturers in the country
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:36.960]  and we just go, we're going above and beyond organic standards, government standards,
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.960]  everything standards and we're going with the most powerful dosages
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:46.960]  and they're like, wow, you're going to put $40 in one bottle like DNA force of just one of the compounds.
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:49.960]  Each bottle has that much of one of the compounds in it.
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:52.960]  The BioPQQ, the CoQTin, all of it.
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:55.960]  These are nutraceutical over the top. Our iodine.
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.960]  Try it next to all the others. Blow you away.
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:03.960]  Double the strength of the leading competitors. 50% stronger than our last formula that's still available.
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:06.960]  People say this doesn't taste horrible. Why does it taste different?
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:09.960]  Because it's not mixed in alcohol and it's true nascent iodine from a crystal source.
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:13.960]  Not a seaweed source that we believe, from our research, is not true nascent iodine
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:18.960]  and bounds to the alcohol. This is in an organic palm oil.
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:23.960]  And for me and my family and my research, I believe for my immune system
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:28.960]  and for bolstering my body's defenses, it's just as important or more important than colloidal silver.
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:32.960]  And iodine is something you've got to have. Colloidal silver is not something you've got to have.
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:34.960]  Without iodine, you die.
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:38.960]  And there's a big conspiracy with them lowering the allowances down to nothing.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:43.960]  So infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:46.960]  Stock up with your preparedness cabinet.
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.960]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:55.960]  The lung shield is a whole bunch of essential oils and other key extracts.
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:59.960]  Concentrated. This isn't like normal throat sprays. They have some menthol.
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:02.960]  It's so thick, though, you got to have to use it 10 times.
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:05.960]  You know, kind of wash out the sprayer because it will clog.
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:08.960]  It's super thick in the bottle. It's oil.
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:11.960]  There's not fillers in this stuff.
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:17.960]  We checked into the leading competitors' throat spray and it's like $1.50 and they sell it for 20 bucks.
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:24.960]  Okay? We go over the top and put like $10, I think it is, of product into it.
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:28.960]  So it's just, if you want real hardcore stuff, this is it.
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:35.960]  And it supports infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, The Nightly News, the reporters, the writers, the researchers,
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:42.960]  the great people running the show right now, the customer service people, the graphics folks, everybody here.
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:44.960]  And we're trying to expand in the face of this tyranny.
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:47.960]  I'm not going to risk my life and just, you know, wait by the wayside here.
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:51.960]  Wayne, I want to go to calls and then finish up on Gary Webb.
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:55.960]  But first off, tell folks about your new book at WayneMadsonReport.com.
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:59.960]  Well, it's called The Star and the Sword and, you know, ever since 9-11,
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:06.960]  I'm actually right now pursuing yet another angle on 9-11, which came to me just recently.
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:15.960]  But, you know, people said, well, you know, I was the one who received this DEA report on these mysterious Israeli art students
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:21.960]  who were penetrating security of various places before 9-11.
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:28.960]  And then of course, I got that list, remember, of all the suspects that had Ada and all the rest of the hijackers
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:31.960]  and all these other Saudis and other people on it.
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:39.960]  And in addition to the guy who was running the urban moving systems, the Israeli-owned moving company in New Jersey.
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:43.960]  And I said, you know, I got thinking, people said, no, the Israelis were behind it.
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.960]  No, the Saudis were behind it.
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:50.960]  But, you know, what we see with ISIL or ISIS or Islamic State or whatever they're calling themselves this week,
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:56.960]  you know, they're being supported by not only the Saudis and their friends, these potentates on the Persian Gulf,
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:01.960]  but also as we see when the Golan Heights, they're being supported by the Israeli defense.
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:07.960]  And that's not anti-Israel when it's in the Jerusalem Post that Israel's government is supporting al-Qaeda.
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:08.960]  It's a fact.
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:16.960]  And as you said, why did Fox News when 9-11 happened, they did four reports on the Israelis getting arrested as well.
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:19.960]  Was that some inner blackmail fight going on?
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:26.960]  I heard it was, Cheney had had a big fight with then Sharon, Ariel Sharon, the prime minister of Israel,
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:29.960]  and wanted to send a message to the Israeli government.
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:31.960]  Look, we know what's going on.
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:33.960]  And he handed part of that DEA report.
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:36.960]  It was about 64 pages, if I recall.
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:43.960]  He handed part of it to Britt Hume, who attended the vice president's Christmas party in early December 01.
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:48.960]  And of course, you know, a week and a half later, Fox ran with that four-part series.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:51.960]  I heard that was what prompted it.
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:59.960]  But, you know, remember back in Desert Storm, Saddam Hussein was firing scuds not only at Israel, but also at Saudi Arabia.
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:06.960]  These two countries, I'm suggesting in the book, the star and the sword, have had a long-term relationship.
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:12.960]  Going back to the 70s and 60s with a group of intelligence agencies called the Safari Club.
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:22.960]  But even back to post-World War I, when the first Saudi king, even Saud, sent a letter to Haim Weisman ahead of the World Zionist Movement,
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.960]  saying, look, we, we Souths have no problem with you establishing a homeland in Palestine.
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:29.960]  That's history.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:31.960]  And some people want to ignore that history.
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:39.960]  But I would suggest that that link between Riyadh and Jerusalem has been around a lot longer.
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:46.960]  Why would Saudi Arabia want to overthrow Libya, overthrow Syria, overthrow Egypt, overthrow Iraq?
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:48.960]  I mean, I guess so they can take it over.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:57.960]  Part of Netanyahu's 19, he came out with a plan in 1996 called a clean break or securing the realm.
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:02.960]  It talked about overthrowing these Arab governments and replacing them with warring factions.
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:10.960]  There's also the Odead plan formulated by an Israeli in 1982 that called for the same thing.
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:16.960]  So when we saw Wesley Clark come out and say, he saw a list of governments that were going to overthrow in the region,
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:17.960]  it's the same list.
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:19.960]  It's the same plan.
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:21.960]  Clark, Clark didn't disagree with it.
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:24.960]  He just said he saw it after 9-11.
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:29.960]  Look, what's Clark saw, the Odead plan, the clean break plan in Netanyahu, which was, which was-
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:30.960]  Sure.
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:32.960]  It's written by Richard Pearl. It's all the same thing.
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:34.960]  And we're seeing it played out now with ISIS.
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:40.960]  The ISIS represents 80-12,000 mercenaries from 81 different countries.
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:43.960]  A lot of them haven't stepped foot in the mosque in their entire lives.
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:45.960]  They have no linkage to Islam.
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:46.960]  So what do you call that?
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:47.960]  It's a mercenary army.
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:49.960]  It's a CIA secret army.
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:55.960]  And my issue is, if these Arab countries were really attacking us, it'd be one thing.
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:42:00.960]  Over and over again, the West stirs them up, arms the radical group to go into friendly countries like Egypt,
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:02.960]  try to overthrow them.
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:03.960]  I mean, this is-
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:03.960]  Yeah.
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:04.960]  But this is the same thing.
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:05.960]  Shut our businesses down.
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:07.960]  Shut our economy down.
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:10.960]  It's not an American government, even an Israeli government.
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:14.960]  It's just these criminal networks that get power out of crises.
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:20.960]  And then they're taking my liberties and your liberties and our children's liberties in the name of al-Qaeda that they run.
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:22.960]  I want the fraud to end.
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:24.960]  Just like they're letting Ebola in and then they're going to let it get out of control.
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:27.960]  They're not going to stop with Iraq or Syria.
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:35.960]  When I was in Iran recently, I was in a car traveling between Shiraz and a town on the way to the Persian Gulf.
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:38.960]  And I noticed the Iranian police were stopping cars.
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:40.960]  And I asked, what are they doing?
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:47.960]  And my driver said, oh, well, they're stopping people that look like they're Arabs to see if they're members of ISIL.
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:49.960]  I said, interesting, you think they're in the country.
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:53.960]  And then I started asking, and yes, they crossed over the Iranian border.
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:56.960]  They're going after the Iranian government next.
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:07.960]  And we also had a situation in Syria where the largely Tunisian commanders of ISIL were actually turned on by Chechens from Georgia,
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:10.960]  the Republic of Georgia and Uyghurs from Western China.
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:12.960]  They beheaded these guys.
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:19.960]  These were pretty good commanders and replaced them because the CIA, the Saudis and the Israelis want that,
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:28.960]  eventually want ISIL to go after Russia and China and Chechens and Uyghurs are the ones they're going to use to do that.
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:35.960]  And look, what's happening in Hong Kong right now, these protests are a carbon copy of what took place in Maiden Square in Kiev.
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:38.960]  This is a direct assault on China.
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:40.960]  ISIL is not going to stop Iran.
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:42.960]  They're going to go into Western China.
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:44.960]  They're going to go into southern Russia.
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:45.960]  We've got to go to calls.
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:46.960]  They've been holding.
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:48.960]  Charlie in Canada, thanks for holding.
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:51.960]  Then we'll go to Sean, Indico kid, and Anthony, go ahead.
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:55.960]  Alex, I owe you a heartfelt thank you.
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:01.960]  I've had a disease called sarcoidosis for 25 years, been critically ill for 14.
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:07.960]  I ordered the oxy powder and it knocked it out of me literally in six days.
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:13.960]  Well, we can't make medical claims, but I only sell stuff that's blown my socks off literally.
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:22.960]  I mean, oxy powder, it's time released oxygen, releases in the small and large intestine, or large and then small intestine,
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:26.960]  and it just other herbal flushes and stuff are very painful.
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:30.960]  This is just life changing.
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:33.960]  I was pushed for a year to carry it, pushed for a year to promote it.
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:35.960]  I was like, no, I'm not going to do that because I'm not into that stuff.
[02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:41.960]  And it really has been amazing and made my waist size go down personally and has just done a lot of stuff.
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:44.960]  I mean, what happened when you took it?
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:47.960]  At first, it wasn't uncomfortable.
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:51.960]  I kind of felt my stomach bubble up a little bit, but it wasn't too bad.
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.960]  And literally the next day I woke up and something was different.
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:01.960]  And within two days, I was walking around my house together.
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:05.960]  There are parts of my house I haven't seen in 10 years, literally.
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:07.960]  You were in so much pain in your stomach?
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:15.960]  Well, actually, I had joint pain, hives, I had lesions on my head that are healing now.
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:17.960]  My system has been so...
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:23.960]  Well, they say 70% of the immune system is in the gut, and so if that's messed up, then you just literally...
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:27.960]  I mean, most skin stuff dermatologists will tell you is based in the gut.
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:34.960]  And look, John Harmon told me today, in fact, John, if you've got the mic hooked up up there in Minnesota, we're in Austin,
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:38.960]  come on and tell folks what you told me today about oxypowder.
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:44.960]  Sure, I just popped in Alex's ear and told them that I do take the phone calls here at the network
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:49.960]  and just influx of callers calling in about the oxypowder, just saying,
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:54.960]  hey, I don't need to be on the air necessarily, but just pass on the word that that stuff definitely works.
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:58.960]  Yeah, folks, we don't sell stuff unless I've had dramatic effects.
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:04.960]  For a year, groups like, you got to try this, this is my star product, Alex, I'm telling you, I'll private label it for you.
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:07.960]  This is the best thing I've ever made. Hollywood all uses it, look at this, look at that.
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:10.960]  And he goes, Alex, you want to be healthy, you've done this stuff, do this.
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:14.960]  And I'm just like, you know what, man, I don't want to go on air and pitch something for my intestines.
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:18.960]  I mean, talk about what it does, but I go, okay, I'll find, I'll take it.
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:20.960]  Unbelievable, sort of taking it about two months ago.
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:26.960]  I only take it a few days a week, take like five capsules at night in the morning, just get ready.
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:32.960]  And in my stomach, my mom, I was at my parents' house with the kids swimming, Shatterty,
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:35.960]  and my mom walks over and she goes, are you on something?
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:36.960]  And I go, what do you mean?
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:38.960]  She goes, well, you've been working out hard and looking better.
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:43.960]  But she goes, my God, you look like you're 20 again, your muscles, your stomach, it's almost gone.
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:44.960]  What is going on?
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:46.960]  I said, iodine and oxypowder.
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:50.960]  And I said, I'm scared of this, you know, Ebola, so I'm taking everything now.
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:53.960]  I'm finally just taking the full amount, not forgetting every other day.
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:56.960]  And she went, well, I want some of that.
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:00.960]  So, and I still don't look that good compared to because I've gotten in bad shape, but I look a lot better.
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:01.960]  And it's just amazing.
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:02.960]  I didn't mean to go off on a big jag.
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:05.960]  We need to send Wayne some of this and see what happens to him.
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:07.960]  But thank you for that plug, sir.
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:10.960]  Yes, it's the real deal in FullWarsLife.com.
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:12.960]  Sean in Ohio, Sean, you're on the air.
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:13.960]  Go ahead.
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:15.960]  Hi, Alex, how are you today?
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:16.960]  Good, brother.
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:17.960]  Go ahead.
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:23.960]  Well, I'm calling from Akron, Ohio, as you well know, is the second destination of Amber Vincent.
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:28.960]  She recently was in the Northfield neighborhood here where we live, visiting family and friends.
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:30.960]  Yeah, you're talking about the nurse with Ebola.
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:31.960]  Correct.
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:32.960]  Yeah, she was taken care of.
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:34.960]  I think it was Mr. Duncan down there in Texas.
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:42.960]  And we got some, my wife's a nurse and, you know, we've been really closely monitoring the situation, you know, has everyone else here in Akron.
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:48.960]  But there's a lot of things that don't seem quite right, and I've got a list of information here for you.
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:50.960]  I'll try to run through it as quickly as I can.
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:52.960]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:57.960]  Basically, you know, there's news that's just come out here locally.
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:58.960]  I'm not sure if it's national yet.
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:07.960]  But before, you know, she had treated Mr. Duncan there at the hospital and she had had a conversation with her Reverend Glenn Lorenzo, I do believe.
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:15.960]  Before she even flew up here to Akron saying that, you know, she was very unhappy with the gear that she was given to wear while she was treating Mr. Duncan.
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:18.960]  Yeah, and then she called the CDC and said, I have a fever.
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:20.960]  I worked on Ebola patient.
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:21.960]  Can I fly?
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:22.960]  And they said, yeah, go ahead, cupcake.
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:24.960]  I mean, this none of this sounds right.
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:25.960]  Keep going.
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:28.960]  Yeah, they went ahead and just let her fly even though she was symptomatic.
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:31.960]  You know, first they told us here in Akron that, you know, there's nothing to worry about.
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:34.960]  You know, she wasn't symptomatic as of the day of her flight.
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:38.960]  And then it came out afterwards that she was symptomatic as early as Friday.
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:43.960]  So she spent the whole weekend here in our neighborhood, you know, in our stores and everything else.
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:50.960]  And so, you know, everyone here is a little bit on edge, but, you know, there's been a lot more going on in this neighborhood prior to this.
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:54.960]  Listen, what's your bottom line so Wayne can comment?
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:49:03.960]  Well, basically the bottom line is that, you know, Metro health came out recently here, which is a hospital, Cleveland Metro, saying that they are prepared for Ebola.
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:08.960]  And, you know, Mayor Johnson Squalick here in Akron said, no, we are not ready for that.
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:11.960]  You know, we want them to be, if there are anybody that becomes symptomatic,
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:15.960]  we'd like them to be shipped out to a proper hospital that can deal with it.
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:21.960]  Margo Irma, which is the Summit County Public Health Department spokesperson said that, you know, they would like them.
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:22.960]  Sure, it's a total disarray.
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:27.960]  I got to jump for other callers and to go kidnothers, but I mean, we get the basis of what you're saying.
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:32.960]  Could this be, you know, Ebola is real in Africa, but could this be a simulant with people that think they have Ebola?
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:39.960]  As Mr. Steele said from the CIA a few weeks before this broke, that it could be a simulant and something to create panic.
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:40.960]  What's your take, Wayne Madsen?
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:44.960]  Well, we are getting into flu season after all, so people could get confused.
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:52.960]  But, you know, remember Obama hosted this Africa Summit about a month and a half ago or so, two months ago.
[02:49:52.960 --> 02:50:01.960]  And I said then, I said, why in the world would he be having these private executive jets fly these leaders in who won't be going through the normal security check?
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:12.960]  Or customs immigration checks at the airport because many of them flew into Andrews Air Force Base and others flew into Dulles and went through the VIP lounge there.
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:21.960]  And I, you know, and then we had Frieden, this Tom Frieden, Dr. Frieden ahead of the CDC said, oh, well, Ebola will never be a problem here in the United States.
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:23.960]  We were not worried about.
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:26.960]  And I said, then I said, this guy sounds like a quack.
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:34.960]  And, you know what, his job before he was the head of CDC was, he was Mayor Bloomberg's director of public health in New York.
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.960]  He's the guy who came up with the ban on big sodas.
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:43.960]  I mean, can you imagine this guy goes from big sodas to Ebola?
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:47.960]  I think he should go back to the big sodas and leave the CDC.
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:49.960]  A bunch of control freaks.
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:50.960]  All right, thank you.
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:56.960]  Thank you to the kids and Anthony and January, I think is how you say it.
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:50:57.960]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:23.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:49.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:49.960 --> 02:52:15.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:41.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:41.960 --> 02:53:07.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:33.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:59.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:14.960]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:17.960]  Indigo kid, you're on the air with Wayne Madsen, our guest.
[02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:18.960]  Go ahead, Indigo.
[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:20.960]  Thanks for holding.
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:31.960]  Hey, guys. Well, because Ebola has gone airborne in the sense of these flights from West Africa, I wanted to watch something called Operation Airborne Ebola.
[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:39.960]  I was thinking as people wore the T-shirt I designed or your shirt Alex designed their own, just a permanent marker on a white T-shirt.
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:46.960]  Every time they go and take a flight in the US, they wear these anti-Ebola, anti-Obama shirts.
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:48.960]  That could be a big news story.
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:51.960]  They will try to ban you wearing them and then it will become a national news story.
[02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:54.960]  Everyone should design their own if they don't want to buy one from us.
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:55:01.960]  I totally agree with you and just show how they, and then say, well, wait, you're allowed to fly it in, but I can't wear a shirt saying it.
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:02.960]  That's a great idea.
[02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:04.960]  Wayne Madsen, your take on that.
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:12.960]  Well, I just get back to the whole thing with the, I don't think we're being told the truth about this.
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:21.960]  I think Ron Klein has been brought in to basically put an information cone over, you know, news coming out.
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:22.960]  That's no job.
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:32.960]  Yeah, basically, you know, and how many cases, there was a woman who was also projectile vomiting at one of the train stations in Boston.
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:35.960]  And then, you know, they tried to say, oh no, was she, you know, she.
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:39.960]  You got Nigerians getting on flights, dying in Houston, dying in New York.
[02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:40.960]  New York.
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:41.960]  Vomit everywhere.
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:42.960]  Exactly.
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:44.960]  And I just, I'm not buying it.
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:46.960]  But, you know, we're talking about Gary Webb earlier.
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:51.960]  I think Gary set the gold standard for shoe leather investigative journalism.
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.960]  I was so happy he contacted me by email and I never believed he killed himself.
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:05.960]  I got into a heated argument with somebody who I knew very well and who worked with, I worked with this guy who insisted it was suicide.
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:08.960]  And I was just, I just publicly disagree.
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:11.960]  Yeah, that was the guy with the connection to the CAA.
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:12.960]  Yeah, I think it's the same.
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:13.960]  Yeah, it's the same guy.
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:19.960]  But I talked to many other people who said, look, you know, he, the one thing the movie said is he got out of journalism.
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:28.960]  But when he called me, he was working for an alternative newspaper in Sacramento and he was investigating the same company, ACS, for red light camera fraud.
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:30.960]  But I think he was looking at it.
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:37.960]  He contacted me because he knew I was looking at them with potential election machine fraud, voting machine fraud.
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:40.960]  And I think, I think his, he had other information.
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:43.960]  I think he had a great career ahead of him.
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:48.960]  Oh, they were scared of his name and the fact that he never backed off, never said he was wrong, was being vindicated.
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:50.960]  They couldn't kill his name.
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:51.960]  So they blew his head off.
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:52.960]  Right.
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:57:00.960]  And, you know, I mean, I think a guy's like Gary Webb and other investigative journalists I've known over the years who are no longer with as many, you know, died.
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:04.960]  They just got old died of cancer and stuff like that.
[02:57:04.960 --> 02:57:10.960]  But I try to emulate these people who were my basically my mentors in journalism.
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:19.960]  And that's why I'm getting ready to go pursue yet another angle on 9 11 because I may be 13 years ago, but I'm not going to give up on that story.
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:20.960]  No, great job.
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:21.960]  I want to do five more minutes and overdrive and finish.
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:23.960]  I'll let you get out of here after doing two hours with us.
[02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:28.960]  But I want to go to Anthony and in January and bill if we have time.
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:33.960]  But the minute we have left in this hour, folks can visit Wayne Madsen report.com if they want to see really hardcore journalism.
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:39.960]  And a guy who isn't, you know, acting like he knows so many angles, he really is super informed.
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:49.960]  It is a delightful pleasure to have him on for two hours and be able to just hear all the factoids and data he brings up because I've researched so much of this and he knows more than I do on so many fronts.
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:54.960]  And that's a real pleasure to be able to occasionally actually sit at somebody's feet and learn something.
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:59.960]  That's the true mark of a master as well as you want to learn more and know how much you don't know.
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:08.960]  But Wayne, as we go to break here, people like Gary Webb will be remembered forever for being honorable in the arena, not backing off and they threaten to kill him and his family.
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:11.960]  He is the example of a real man, a real human.
[02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:14.960]  And all those that helped kill him were part of it.
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:20.960]  And who went along with it, they are a bunch of cowardly people who I don't think belong to this species, Wayne.
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:29.960]  Yeah, and, you know, the Washington Post L.A. Times and New York Times attacked him and they're still attacking him based on this movie. They should be ashamed of themselves.
[02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:33.960]  They are sell-out journalists. They're nothing more than stenographers. They're not journalists.
[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:36.960]  They are absolute just cowards. They have no honor.
[02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:40.960]  Back in 60 seconds, take a few final calls in overdrive. Some stations don't carry it.

[02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:09.960]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:12.960]  The Prime Directive did credit Alex Jones.
[02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:15.960]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:59:15.960 --> 02:59:18.960]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:20.960]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:20.960 --> 02:59:22.960]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:59:22.960 --> 02:59:24.960]  The targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:30.960]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:59:45.960 --> 03:00:03.960]  Electrally it's but God you can fail it.
[03:00:03.960 --> 03:00:06.960]  I'm just going to talk over this intro as we have limited time.
[03:00:06.960 --> 03:00:07.960]  Big brother.
[03:00:07.960 --> 03:00:09.960]  Alex Jones here back live.
[03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:11.960]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:12.960]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:14.960]  Well so does he.
[03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:15.960]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:21.960]  Yes one of the greatest things in my life is being able to associate with other informed
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:23.960]  honorable people that aren't cowards.
[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:30.960]  And the older I get the more I just cannot believe how blessed I am to come from an honorable family of good people overall.
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:36.960]  And that I am not in the company or culture of backstabbing yes men and cowards.
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:38.960]  I'm just going to say that again here.
[03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:42.960]  Anthony in Florida you're on the air with Wayne Madsen. Go ahead.
[03:00:42.960 --> 03:00:48.960]  Hello I've got a question or a question or comment from Mr. Madsen or question too.
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:49.960]  Sure.
[03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:50.960]  Yes.
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:51.960]  Okay.
[03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:56.960]  A while back I watched I saw this video and it showed General David Petraeus and he was
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:01:01.960]  speaking to a group of people and he made the comment what comes after America.
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:04.960]  North America is in the North American Union.
[03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:09.960]  And I was wondering what his what the status on that is.
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:10.960]  Go ahead Wayne.
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:15.960]  Yeah well look what's going on with the the Trans Pacific trade partnership which is going
[03:01:15.960 --> 03:01:19.960]  to create a basically a union of Pacific Rim nations.
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:25.960]  Now there's also a trans North America European trade partnership.
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:26.960]  That's what's happening.
[03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:27.960]  It's already official.
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:28.960]  They're already following it.
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:31.960]  They're already making our governments illegitimate and the public just doesn't know.
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:32.960]  Absolutely.
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:35.960]  And that's that's you know it's all going to be governed by corporations.
[03:01:35.960 --> 03:01:42.960]  So unless you're a major stockholder your vote on election day isn't going to really
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:44.960]  mean a beans.
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:48.960]  Yeah we're training and stuff you know to fight you know like the World War II enemy.
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:54.960]  Meanwhile it's a corporate enemy in suits that organizes the chaos and then presides
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:57.960]  over the chaos to wreck our lives and consolidate power.
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:01:58.960]  Great question Anthony.
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:01.960]  Gennaro in Arizona you're on the air.
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:02.960]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:03.960]  Hi Alex.
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:05.960]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:06.960]  Hi Wayne.
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:11.960]  Listen we spoke a couple of weeks ago about the audacity of the CDC director.
[03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:13.960]  I just wanted to touch on a couple of things.
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:21.960]  I really believe that Thomas Duncan and these two nurses do not have Ebola and this is why
[03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:26.960]  I feel that this is a part of their distraction diversion and deflection.
[03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:29.960]  It full well could be they've been caught doing something like this before but I mean
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:32.960]  that there really is Ebola raging across Africa.
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:37.960]  That I know the reason I feel that way is because Robert David Steel said they would
[03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:40.960]  try to use a bio stimulus that acts like Ebola.
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:46.960]  Here's my reasoning because everybody in that household for Thomas David Duncan do not have
[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:47.960]  Ebola.
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:50.960]  Yeah why did the nurses get it but not the family.
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:53.960]  It is suspicious but that's the problem with the totally lying government.
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:56.960]  You can't believe anything they say so we don't even know.
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:02:58.960]  Wayne your comments.
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:05.960]  Well you know remember that when they sent the woman to Atlanta I believe it was Amber
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:06.960]  Vincent.
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:07.960]  Yeah it was.
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:12.960]  It was a guy everyone was wearing these hazmat suits when they were putting on her Medevac
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:16.960]  plane in Dallas except for the guy in the back who was in charge.
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:17.960]  It was a clipboard.
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:22.960]  I mean the clipboard man has now become as infamous as the Bhupushka lady and the guy
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:26.960]  with the umbrella on Dealey Plaza on November 22nd.
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:30.960]  That's right and he gets out of the vehicle with them and then he's touching the gurney
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:31.960]  and stuff.
[03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:32.960]  Yeah.
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:34.800]  Yeah I mean I guess he's immune Wayne.
[03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:40.960]  I guess he's immune so they need to find out what his blood is to try to clone it so they
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:46.960]  can come up with the vaccine because he's an amazing human being if he is immune.
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:53.400]  But look you know there's so much disinformation on this and as we talked about with flu season
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:04:00.600]  coming on look I got off of a flight from Dubai flew from Tehran to Dubai it was Emirates
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:06.440]  Airways went to Boston Logan and of course I had a wonderful reception by the ICE people
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:12.360]  customs that's another story but I was held for about an hour and given that you know
[03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:14.800]  under cross-examination without a lawyer but.
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:15.800]  Well you weren't illegal.
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:16.800]  That's why.
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:17.800]  Right.
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:23.080]  But but I just like a week a little over a week later that same flight and they had
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:29.800]  the hazmat guys come on because five people were on that same plane with signs or symptoms
