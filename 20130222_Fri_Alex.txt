[00:12.120 --> 00:40.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.360 --> 00:47.960]  ladies and gentlemen I can't believe it's already Friday and we're going to be
[00:47.960 --> 00:55.240]  here live for the next three hours on this 22nd day of February 2013 and I
[00:55.240 --> 01:01.400]  will attempt to be calm today and go over all of the off-the-charts news and
[01:01.400 --> 01:07.240]  information that we're going to be covering now I told you this was coming
[01:07.240 --> 01:13.840]  but now it's official the ATF is just going to make rules outside of law to
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.600]  start banning semi-automatic firearms and the federal government without a
[01:18.600 --> 01:24.200]  judge or jury or even doctor's designation is going to declare most
[01:24.200 --> 01:32.080]  vets mentally incompetent and mail you a letter and one lawyer alone knows of
[01:32.080 --> 01:39.480]  hundreds of vets that are coming to him getting this letter and so we're going
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.320]  to be going over this report that's up at info wars.com federal government
[01:45.320 --> 01:50.680]  moves to disarm veterans and Kurt Nemo has added the Department of Veterans
[01:50.680 --> 01:57.920]  Affairs official letter that states a determination of incompetency will
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.360]  prohibit you from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or transporting a firearm
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.160]  ammunition if you knowingly violate any of these prohibitions you may be fined
[02:06.160 --> 02:10.600]  imprisoned or both pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act
[02:10.600 --> 02:17.440]  public document number 103-159 as implemented in 18 United States code
[02:17.440 --> 02:30.080]  924-A2 and drudgereport.com has the original story on this where they
[02:30.080 --> 02:39.480]  break down report feds send letters to vets from VA prohibiting ownership or
[02:39.480 --> 02:43.800]  purchase of firearms or even shooting them and they have the area excised and
[02:43.800 --> 02:50.120]  it's from a lawyer at red flag news now I'm already aware of this information so
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.200]  I can confirm this is going on but it's intensifying Clinton when he left
[02:54.200 --> 02:59.360]  office tried this about 89,000 vets just suddenly were told they couldn't own
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.480]  guns anymore but become a big court issue and they had to back off this is
[03:03.480 --> 03:10.080]  dwarfing that right now and this isn't where a court finds you incompetent and
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.520]  so you're put in the nut house you're in the nut house now you're in the nut
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.560]  house now I'm gonna take off on the Johnny Cash song you're in the jailhouse
[03:19.560 --> 03:26.760]  now and this is just completely arbitrary what the Soviets did it's what
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.560]  so many historians have have pointed out and talked about about tyranny coming
[03:31.560 --> 03:37.560]  in a medical form and not that this globalism is so much a Soviet system
[03:37.560 --> 03:44.520]  they use Soviet models of control and Soviet collectivism at the grassroots to
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.720]  control and redistribute wealth but then it's done a fascist way as it always is
[03:48.720 --> 03:56.960]  only redistributed to key select combines for political control and then
[03:56.960 --> 04:01.200]  you have the globalist offshore who are exempt from all that pretty devastating
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.840]  info the reason the curtain memo article is important because it's originally in
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.480]  red flag news and the gateway planet dot com via drudge report dot com the
[04:10.480 --> 04:17.840]  reason this is so important is that we've been on this for 17 years but but
[04:17.840 --> 04:23.360]  hardcore for 11 plus that it's not al-qaeda that homeland security is for
[04:23.360 --> 04:30.480]  it's for gun owners conservatives libertarians constitutionalist you name
[04:30.480 --> 04:36.120]  it and that the liberals have all this liberal talk on the surface a lot of
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.320]  which I actually agree with but they don't follow through with it it's all
[04:40.320 --> 04:45.240]  oppressive they're the real authoritarians they are the authoritarians
[04:45.240 --> 04:48.840]  they say a lot of great stuff about a quality and the rest of it but it's all
[04:48.840 --> 04:55.080]  talk it's camouflage they are the most dangerous authoritarian party and the
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.680]  republicans of their kissing cousins at the leadership level they ride back

[08:20.400 --> 08:26.320]  Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up every one of
[08:26.320 --> 08:33.440]  them Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in I would have done it defending the
[08:33.440 --> 08:44.160]  republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones it's all
[08:44.160 --> 08:52.520]  happening day by day grain by grain the hourglass runs dry our liveries spilling
[08:52.520 --> 09:03.160]  into the dark void of tyranny it is Friday the 22nd day of February 2013
[09:03.160 --> 09:09.800]  and we stand here at a crossroads in a conundrum in a paradox never have
[09:09.800 --> 09:14.280]  there been more people awake worldwide to tyranny the council on farm relations
[09:14.280 --> 09:18.640]  bemoans that the big New Brzezinski one of the top global tacticians bemoans
[09:18.640 --> 09:25.040]  that but also never before has there been greater technological systems of
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.560]  domination surveillance and social control pointed at free humanity and
[09:29.560 --> 09:39.520]  never have we had a more decentralized tyranny that basically load balances in
[09:39.520 --> 09:45.640]  a plausible deniability algorithm to where it's very hard to cut a hydra's
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.400]  head off because these globalist couch all their policies and rules and laws
[09:51.400 --> 09:57.680]  and frauds in different committees and waivers and certifications so that the
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.760]  bureaucracy is so deep that no one can ever point the finger at just one person
[10:04.760 --> 10:11.360]  and that's why the tyrants can get away with so much there have been any cases
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.440]  in history where you have an oligarchy a small ruling elite or a royal dynasty or
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.600]  one emperor for that matter and they will actually be ego maniacs who want big
[10:20.600 --> 10:26.040]  public work projects and aqueducts and want the population educated so they
[10:26.040 --> 10:30.200]  can dominate their neighbors have a better military and a better economic
[10:30.200 --> 10:38.000]  system domination through trade you've heard of the philosopher king you can
[10:38.000 --> 10:51.960]  actually get golden ages out of the benevolent dictator the problem is
[10:51.960 --> 11:01.040]  those are very rare a and b once the centralization is set up you can be
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.240]  assured that when that emperor is killed or that emperor dies you're going to get
[11:06.240 --> 11:11.760]  a psychopathic demon in their place or maybe just somebody who's a little bit
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.760]  of a tyrant but down the road you will get a absolute out-of-control
[11:17.760 --> 11:27.520]  psychopathic control freak in there and then all hell will be released I've
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.640]  studied the psychopathic mindset and the different dictatorial mindsets the
[11:32.640 --> 11:36.080]  different variants throughout history a because I want to understand the
[11:36.080 --> 11:39.520]  present to know the present you have to know the past to know the future you
[11:39.520 --> 11:43.280]  need to know the past and the present that's all important that's what the
[11:43.280 --> 11:46.720]  globalists obsess on all day that's what their Google and NSA spying is all
[11:46.720 --> 11:50.200]  about it's what all their smart houses and smart meters and all these
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.920]  surveillance bots hiding in plain view in our homes are doing but again they
[11:55.920 --> 12:04.640]  lack the general deeper loving kind-eyed kind-sold understanding of their own
[12:04.640 --> 12:12.520]  human nature to be able to wield this power and they are arrogant and they
[12:12.520 --> 12:19.200]  are basically like a diver who goes down below 150 feet starts getting what
[12:19.200 --> 12:25.440]  is it the nitrogen psychosis and starts getting higher than a kite and feeling
[12:25.440 --> 12:31.560]  incredibly confident and then you swim into that old wreck even though you're
[12:31.560 --> 12:35.800]  almost out of oxygen feeling confident you get caught up it cuts your air hose
[12:35.800 --> 12:43.520]  and you drown and tyrants up in those upper latitudes of power if their
[12:43.520 --> 12:51.080]  narcissist slash sadist control freaks or whatever variant of that they get the
[12:51.080 --> 12:57.760]  opposite of the megalomania up top and then start hating everyone below them
[12:57.760 --> 13:04.360]  and engaging an absolute oppression and domination and anything left standing
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.240]  has to be pulled down because it's a threat to them yurtle the turtle has to
[13:09.240 --> 13:14.640]  be up on top and so higher higher build me up higher I have to be higher than the
[13:14.640 --> 13:21.040]  birds have to be higher than the clouds have to be higher than the sun the old
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.640]  story of yurtle the turtle dr. Seuss and here we are at that point there is no
[13:27.640 --> 13:32.440]  doubt that the establishment has decided to go the way of premeditated
[13:32.440 --> 13:40.960]  oppression the republicans have been told get in line they're running the hoax
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.840]  that the realty party not the neocon variant has been discredited because
[13:44.840 --> 13:48.720]  even though it's not perfect it holds the seeds of the republic private
[13:48.720 --> 13:53.560]  property the family second amendment right to life things like that in its
[13:53.560 --> 13:59.280]  guts and so it must be destroyed and so they're running the hoax that the
[13:59.280 --> 14:02.720]  states are discredited and there's no rights there and there's no rights in
[14:02.720 --> 14:07.240]  the individuals and gun owners are collectively guilty for the violence in
[14:07.240 --> 14:10.960]  Mexico even though our government helps set that up with fast and furious and
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.360]  we're guilty for sandy hook and we're collectively terrorist and we're
[14:14.360 --> 14:22.040]  collectively bad and racial division creating a race connection if you don't
[14:22.040 --> 14:25.720]  like socialist health care written by the insurance companies to bankrupt the
[14:25.720 --> 14:31.000]  country and consolidate power completely fascist but they sell it as some
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.200]  socialist freebie well you must be racist then you're like what does that
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.000]  have to do with common sense it's a non it's a non-starter it doesn't
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.160]  makes it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense because everything is debased
[14:43.160 --> 14:52.480]  down to a bunch of bleeding and shouting or or emails and comments I see
[14:52.480 --> 14:57.560]  going I like Newt Gennrich that's a real conservative they don't know he's an
[14:57.560 --> 15:01.360]  globalist picked as a university professor because he wrote publications
[15:01.360 --> 15:06.480]  calling for world government calling for a one-world planetary regime hanging
[15:06.480 --> 15:10.800]  out at Bilderberg group meetings and stuff they don't know and I listen to
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.960]  talk radio callers on other shows they're so helpless most of them and they
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.440]  have no and that's a more informed group on average they have no idea it just
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.600]  doesn't make sense the government shouldn't raise taxes the government
[15:24.600 --> 15:28.400]  shouldn't do that it's it's gonna make the economy shut down they're so
[15:28.400 --> 15:36.520]  stupid they're not stupid ladies and gentlemen they are financially debasing
[15:36.520 --> 15:42.440]  you now here's the deal I'm gonna be getting into the economy I've got to
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.320]  today it's so important covered it some yesterday but not one-tenth of what I
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.600]  should a bunch of medical news now people are finally listening about MSG
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.280]  doesn't just make you sick it brain damages you okay don't eat MSG we've
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.040]  got to eradicate it aspartame now it's coming out as giving people type your
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.160]  diabetes as I told you 17 years ago is it they knew day one they couldn't get
[16:04.160 --> 16:09.600]  it approved in the 60s and 70s folks it killed the monkeys they fed it to
[16:09.600 --> 16:16.160]  kill them don't look it up that's finally in CBS news and finally but but they're
[16:16.160 --> 16:21.440]  hitting us with hundreds of chemicals on purpose remember but even if people are
[16:21.440 --> 16:25.200]  weak-minded and can't admit that because that's scary even if you deny it it's
[16:25.200 --> 16:31.000]  still going on the point is it's it's hurting you so we've got some news on
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.240]  that the shocking truth about organic foods grown in the world's worst
[16:34.240 --> 16:39.880]  environmental cesspool China being flown in it's not just horse meat horse meat
[16:39.880 --> 16:45.920]  it's what's for dinner it's not just a fake fish chicken they texturize and put
[16:45.920 --> 16:49.560]  chemicals in to give it a fishy taste and they put it through different
[16:49.560 --> 16:57.320]  machinery and reconstitutes to look like fish extruding it out of molds they do
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.600]  it with pork all this is coming out that the foods fake the water is fake fake
[17:02.600 --> 17:10.360]  fake fake that's part of living under a tyranny and it's part of living in a
[17:10.360 --> 17:14.240]  society where oh there's no lying going on or I don't care if the government
[17:14.240 --> 17:22.280]  lies to me well when you don't care if the government's lying to you or if you
[17:22.280 --> 17:28.800]  don't care of corporations are lying to you and if you just kind of unplug from
[17:28.800 --> 17:32.760]  reality and just go with it very bad things happen see everybody's been
[17:32.760 --> 17:41.760]  taught it's an attribute to be silly to be foolish to not care to say it's a
[17:41.760 --> 17:47.800]  hell with it but it's not ladies and gentlemen it just makes things worse now
[17:47.800 --> 17:55.400]  that said I'm gonna cover our top story and it ties into the other second
[17:55.400 --> 18:00.440]  amendment news and the TSA news on the other side of this break and I knew this
[18:00.440 --> 18:06.080]  was already being tested I knew this was coming but it really freaks me out
[18:06.080 --> 18:12.800]  because it's so over-the-top brazen and I want you to call all your friends and
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.440]  family whether they let whether they have an iPhone they can go download the
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.560]  free iPhone app that's linked at info wars.com or prisonplanet.com in the
[18:21.560 --> 18:27.400]  listen page area or just Google free info wars iPhone app or there's a free
[18:27.400 --> 18:31.280]  Android apps all of them or you can listen on your local AM and or FM
[18:31.280 --> 18:40.920]  station XM166 picks up the second and third hour but tell your friends and
[18:40.920 --> 18:47.160]  family to tune in right now tell them to tune in right now email them call them
[18:47.160 --> 18:51.440]  tell your co-workers if you're on lunch you need to hear this because the
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.720]  system plans on just putting this out there and maybe they have a congressional
[18:56.720 --> 19:00.560]  hearing and then debate it and then nothing happens this is the end of due

[33:57.440 --> 34:01.760]  Alright folks Alex Jones here back live and we have a lot of new listeners today
[34:01.760 --> 34:06.520]  let me explain what's happened foreign mega banks have taken over the most of
[34:06.520 --> 34:11.000]  the world because they can issue unlimited currency and credit and then pay
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.200]  our governments off to sign on to that fraudulent derivative debt because that
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.960]  fake paper once it's invested and once it infects the 401ks the pension funds
[34:22.960 --> 34:28.400]  the bond markets now is basically holding us all all hostage and this is how
[34:28.400 --> 34:35.320]  they're consolidating the economy into a top-down organized managed command and
[34:35.320 --> 34:42.240]  control system and they have basically hobbled the public's mind by only
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.080]  teaching you about leftism and right wingism or fascism on the right
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.880]  communism on the left and which you know fascism always becomes authoritarian
[34:51.880 --> 34:56.200]  communism becomes authoritarian because their authoritarian systems designed
[34:56.200 --> 35:02.200]  by the robber barons starting in the 1870s on record I mean they've had the
[35:02.200 --> 35:07.320]  congressional hearings on this they've they've been countless white papers and
[35:07.320 --> 35:13.120]  books written by Helmut Schmidt men in power's political retrospective Carol
[35:13.120 --> 35:16.800]  Quigley's tragedy and hope what I don't know four or five books I've read three
[35:16.800 --> 35:23.840]  of them by Zabigniew Brzezinski all of it and they sell it to every audience they
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.080]  sell it to libertarians one way they're Peter Thiel they sell it to liberals
[35:28.080 --> 35:31.200]  another way they sell it to right wingers another way but really it's all
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.640]  the same poison labeled with different flavors it's grape it's cherry it's
[35:36.640 --> 35:42.440]  coconut it's strawberry it's orange it's lime it's a lemon lime it's it's all
[35:42.440 --> 35:49.000]  those flavors it's raspberry Kool-Aid but it's all the same base poison cyanide
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.680]  Jim Jones handed out a bunch of different flavors there in Guiana but it
[35:52.680 --> 35:59.080]  was all the same thing at the rock bottom at the rock bottom and they are
[35:59.080 --> 36:02.640]  trying to create literally a false political reality with a dumb down
[36:02.640 --> 36:07.200]  population so that the globalist let's look at motive get the life extension
[36:07.200 --> 36:13.640]  technologies and can have their progeny enjoy the resources of the earth and the
[36:13.640 --> 36:18.000]  advanced human development for themselves it is the ultimate act of total
[36:18.000 --> 36:25.200]  domination the culmination of British royalty funding scientists in the 1850s
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.900]  beginning for a political system of total control to end the species as it has
[36:30.900 --> 36:37.760]  been known to artificialize it to hobble it to binary damage it with a
[36:37.760 --> 36:43.800]  poison in the culture of artificial degeneration so that the power structure
[36:43.800 --> 36:50.400]  has to be the artificial gravitational girder or center of the wheel system to
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.720]  unify and control it there everything is about making us dependent on them
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.000]  getting us in the judicial system getting us in the psychiatric system
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.600]  getting us into the criminal justice system getting us into the fraternity
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.400]  into the cult into the guild into the right wing and the the liberal the gay
[37:09.400 --> 37:16.280]  the straight the black the white the raza the Metsha the clan getting you
[37:16.280 --> 37:21.000]  into your group then with key globalist over it at each point in Rothkopf and
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.440]  the Kissinger groups superclass model I had Rothkopf you had to the Kissinger
[37:25.440 --> 37:28.560]  group at the time it wrote superclass five years ago I talk about it so much
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.160]  because I'm like why did you come on the show when I saw your book in the
[37:32.160 --> 37:35.200]  Washington Post because well I know it's a good size show and I said did you
[37:35.200 --> 37:39.240]  think I was Alex S. Jones you know the head of the Shorenstein Center and the
[37:39.240 --> 37:43.400]  former head of the New York Times he goes no I know you were Alex E. Jones he
[37:43.400 --> 37:49.480]  goes I wanted to have you on and try to convince you globalism is good I was
[37:49.480 --> 37:51.800]  talking to him during the few breaks he was on for 30 minutes maybe it was an
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.120]  hour you can go pull up that interview out there and after that we've called him
[37:56.120 --> 37:58.680]  he said no I couldn't convince you you don't understand I don't want to come
[37:58.680 --> 38:02.800]  back on I'm too busy but during the breaks he's like well you're part of the
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.080]  superclass you know you're like a leader of the patriots I mean that's how this
[38:07.080 --> 38:11.800]  works oh I can still be a patriot and be mr. libertarian but then I can kind of
[38:11.800 --> 38:17.680]  do little little favors he's like well that's not how it works this is during
[38:17.680 --> 38:21.280]  the break talking to him he's like you know it's not as bad as you say it's the
[38:21.280 --> 38:27.960]  way it's always been you know it's no big deal it's warm inside come on inside
[38:27.960 --> 38:35.600]  Alex but see that's only the cover story folks it's very dark on the inside of
[38:35.600 --> 38:41.640]  this thing and I'm not bragging about myself I'm not bragging about Alex
[38:41.640 --> 38:47.520]  Jones here I'm saying that I've had top national radio executives try to get me
[38:47.520 --> 38:50.680]  to sell out to the New World Order and it's the same thing globalism is the
[38:50.680 --> 38:55.320]  future you can't stop it Alex you're gonna be a star or be on this crusade and
[38:55.320 --> 38:58.960]  go nowhere I'm gonna give him that speech like four times by four different
[38:58.960 --> 39:05.160]  radio executives Rothkopf was giving me the speech here in three-minute breaks
[39:05.160 --> 39:13.800]  don't you understand folks this is not my opinion about this New World Order but
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.640]  I'll tell you what I found when everybody sold out and I never did this on
[39:18.640 --> 39:24.240]  purpose but when everybody sold out it's lesser and lesser returns to sell out
[39:24.240 --> 39:28.200]  I never sold out because I'm not signing on to corruption and evil and death
[39:28.200 --> 39:32.800]  instruction I have good will for people but I'll use an analogy that I've read
[39:32.800 --> 39:37.800]  in the Wall Street Journal and other places about porn 30 years ago a top
[39:37.800 --> 39:40.720]  porn actress might get paid two three million dollars a year half million
[39:40.720 --> 39:46.080]  dollars per picture now the quality of women is off the chart supermodel level
[39:46.080 --> 39:50.960]  and they're getting paid $500 because there's such a glut every young woman
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.360]  wants to be a star the only place you get called a star a mind control event
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.280]  you're a star being a cop you're a star being a bureaucrat you're a you're a
[39:59.280 --> 40:03.200]  star when you're the manager at McDonald's you have power like a tsa says
[40:03.200 --> 40:09.000]  I have power I have power now the women are paid $500 top stars two thousand
[40:09.000 --> 40:16.600]  three thousand and they've got to do more and more horrible things and I've
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.320]  read where the porn directors and people brag it's been my mission to destroy
[40:20.320 --> 40:26.040]  society and Christianity and of course they're just cogs to the top
[40:26.040 --> 40:30.920]  scientific technocrats they've got their God they've got what they believe in but
[40:30.920 --> 40:35.680]  it's about debasing you so you have no human empathy so that when you're being
[40:35.680 --> 40:40.160]  abused next your neighbors won't won't help you because they've lost their
[40:40.160 --> 40:44.200]  empathy in fact I'm gonna get to the top story here in a moment but yesterday I
[40:44.200 --> 40:52.320]  was driving home and I never do this and I said you know what I'm gonna turn
[40:52.320 --> 40:58.080]  down this street and I'm gonna go to this movie theater and I bet there is a
[40:58.080 --> 41:04.920]  zero dark 30s showing in 10 minutes and I didn't really know movie show times
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.800]  because I went home early yesterday at about three o'clock my kids were gonna
[41:09.800 --> 41:14.280]  be home to about six so I thought you know what even showing right at 3 3 10
[41:14.280 --> 41:22.760]  I'll see it I pull in 3 10 walk in it starts two and a half hour movie and I
[41:22.760 --> 41:26.400]  just knew what the whole thing was gonna be it was a giant torture porn event
[41:26.400 --> 41:31.000]  with powerful sexy women doing the torturing and oh it's so powerful the
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.640]  CIA so cool and they're such great people and they're so good and they're so
[41:35.640 --> 41:40.760]  nice folks they run the giant child kidnapping rings they run the narcotics
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.940]  and I don't just need the solicitor general's hearings in 97 where they
[41:44.940 --> 41:50.320]  confirm they run most the narcotics or that that or that the CIA protects the
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.920]  groups that run the snuff films and all of it and Brzezinski's argument in one
[41:53.920 --> 41:57.960]  of his books he says oh yeah we control organized crime what was the
[41:57.960 --> 42:04.240]  technotronic age I believe wrote that in the 70s he goes yeah well well yeah we
[42:04.240 --> 42:08.620]  yeah yeah the intelligence agencies interpolling Europe CIA here we do
[42:08.620 --> 42:13.040]  control the organized crime and all the vices because then we can control it and
[42:13.040 --> 42:16.720]  limit it by controlling it because it'll always be there it's like a fake
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.800]  libertarian ran corporation statement hey it isn't your libertarian
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.240]  technotronic right to grab five-year-olds out of backyards torture them rape them
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.960]  for six months and blow their heads off because you're into that and then all
[42:28.960 --> 42:34.680]  their movies you know are about demons killing kids and the kids kill their
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.280]  parents and you know all the rest of it and and all this stuff getting you
[42:39.280 --> 42:47.200]  ready for the real deal bathing you waterboarding you and just Satanism just
[42:47.200 --> 42:50.560]  oh yeah we're torturing people's kids to keep you safe for 9-11 the whole movies
[42:50.560 --> 42:55.280]  they killed 3,000 of our citizens so we've got to torture them of course they
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.880]  didn't show the little kids being tortured or how they got KSM to talk and
[42:58.880 --> 43:05.960]  then confess the things he didn't do in the movie as dog collars and people
[43:05.960 --> 43:09.560]  defecating on themselves and I sat there and watched women in the audience it was
[43:09.560 --> 43:14.080]  mainly women because it was a matinee and a late matinee and it was about 10
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.960]  women in there about five men and I sat there people watching and watch the
[43:17.960 --> 43:23.000]  women getting upset but also feeling powerful look how they just tortured him
[43:23.000 --> 43:29.120]  getting off on it I mean it's so sick how they're programming you so this is
[43:29.120 --> 43:34.800]  not the CIA this is foreign governments and I don't even need to know all the
[43:34.800 --> 43:41.080]  congressional hearings and what's admitted in the army reports every person
[43:41.080 --> 43:46.840]  I know who was in the CIA in my extended family that I've talked to and it's like
[43:46.840 --> 43:49.680]  you have family the CIA yeah it's like saying I had family that worked for
[43:49.680 --> 43:55.280]  Frito lay it's a gigantic operation about 50 times bigger than you're even
[43:55.280 --> 44:00.680]  told it is there's CIA in every neighborhood it's nothing it's not like
[44:00.680 --> 44:06.480]  some sex it's like porn stars they're nothing but whores on video because
[44:06.480 --> 44:09.960]  there's a glut it's nothing and they can they recruit all these people that
[44:09.960 --> 44:13.960]  think they're rock stars you go to Walmart or Target and half the toys for
[44:13.960 --> 44:17.840]  kids or how to spy on your parents and how to be a spy priming them right out
[44:17.840 --> 44:24.400]  of high school and they all just get off on how their secret agents they're
[44:24.400 --> 44:30.440]  buying the whole thing it's a joke you're nobody you're nobody nobody and
[44:30.440 --> 44:37.120]  nobody rides for free you're not America you're the sword going right in
[44:37.120 --> 44:47.560]  America's art and it was it was Churchill that said the truth must be
[44:47.560 --> 44:50.680]  guarded by a bodyguard of lies that's another twisted way of saying we've
[44:50.680 --> 44:54.400]  got to be more evil than the evil guys to beat them no that's not how you beat
[44:54.400 --> 44:59.840]  evil you have the moral high ground you have the facts and you work and build up
[44:59.840 --> 45:04.000]  society and create investment and give people their own money back and you take
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.920]  to the stars that's what builds civilizations not a bunch of sickos
[45:08.920 --> 45:14.720]  lying to the public and lying to themselves I'm gonna do my review of
[45:14.720 --> 45:21.400]  the film I am it's already out there online to you can buy it online I'm
[45:21.400 --> 45:25.280]  gonna I'm gonna have to watch it and take notes it was so horrible it was
[45:25.280 --> 45:30.440]  exactly what I knew it would be just a giant fable fiction and I knew from the
[45:30.440 --> 45:34.080]  start at the end she would be there when they got his body and I even saw her
[45:34.080 --> 45:37.480]  in a tent unzipping it because none of us were allowed to see bin lotting's it
[45:37.480 --> 45:40.800]  was all fake you know they killed the seals that were involved almost all of
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.760]  them that didn't fit into the narrative like oh Pat Tillman died charging the
[45:45.760 --> 45:53.080]  machine gun nest oh of course he did with the Easter Bunny and I knew I knew
[45:53.080 --> 45:57.600]  before it started she at the end it would be in the tent and that she would
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.160]  unzip it by herself and she would see bin Laden and then we would all have the
[46:02.160 --> 46:08.040]  collective event of seeing bin Laden I remember how they put out all those fake
[46:08.040 --> 46:13.080]  bin Laden videos and photos of him dead and and we even went and found the
[46:13.080 --> 46:16.520]  original photos and showed it was fake and then I talked to people who have
[46:16.520 --> 46:20.200]  like family and intelligence and stuff and they'd go I'm not gonna show you the
[46:20.200 --> 46:23.760]  photo but it's real we were shown it internally and we're like here you don't
[46:23.760 --> 46:28.320]  have those clearances you were sent it by some of your buddies at you know the
[46:28.320 --> 46:31.960]  different defense contractors I won't say which one and and I said is it this
[46:31.960 --> 46:40.840]  one they're like I'm not gonna talk about it oh see you were shown the real
[46:40.840 --> 46:45.640]  photo uh-huh and the weak-minded public that thinks wrestling is real they all
[46:45.640 --> 46:50.440]  went and a lot of them are gonna think that was real oh zero dark 30 you saw
[46:50.440 --> 46:56.640]  bin Laden's body oh and the woman goes it unzips it and and and there it is and
[46:56.640 --> 47:02.560]  it's so so powerful and so wonderful and all the hot blondes and redheads
[47:02.560 --> 47:09.680]  torturing people oh yeah oh it's so powerful and they get the job done
[47:10.400 --> 47:16.280]  oh and it's all this catty fake trendy yuppie thing all these fake mannerisms
[47:16.280 --> 47:22.280]  pre-programmed all of it I could just see the layers of psych warfare
[47:22.280 --> 47:26.440]  meanwhile the guys up on top they're in power because they like to watch snuff
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.040]  films of kids all day all the big old ugly men that you bow down to and kiss
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.200]  their butt all day all you women in the CIA wonder why none of them are
[47:35.200 --> 47:40.520]  interested in you you've just signed on to pulling toddlers teeth out with
[47:40.520 --> 47:48.280]  pliers you've just signed on to the coldest circle of hell the night circle
[47:48.280 --> 47:52.480]  and again I'm not even demonizing the CIA because it's just a New World Order
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.040]  British banking intelligence it's a private Rothschild intelligence basically
[47:56.040 --> 48:01.240]  a Russell trust intelligence an Illuminati intelligence on record
[48:01.240 --> 48:05.920]  Illuminati founded skull and bones 1832 skull and bones creates the core of the
[48:05.920 --> 48:12.120]  OSS U.S. version for British implantation the two penetrating each other
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.000]  merging the houses that's what Pratt house was meant to do it is well set up
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.600]  in 1922 in New York we are the British Empire we are the New World Order and we
[48:23.600 --> 48:27.520]  pay for it and we get the blame for it and we get all of it and then the good
[48:27.520 --> 48:34.160]  old boys sit around and go yeah we got them Arabs we got them Arabs oil we got
[48:34.160 --> 48:38.120]  them Arabs I'm like hey a Bubba what were you paying before the last go for
[48:38.120 --> 48:46.000]  1991 what were you paying in the second big one in 2003 you're paying about a
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.040]  dollar dollar twenty five dollar thirty dollar forty you like paying four
[48:50.040 --> 48:58.400]  bucks again Saddam's crime was pumping too much oil to pay off his debts his
[48:58.400 --> 49:03.000]  crime was wanting to have a sovereign country his crime was being a CIA high
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.040]  level trainee to be a puppet of Iraq and kicking the CIA out and saying I'm
[49:09.040 --> 49:15.640]  the boss his crime was putting women in college his crime was playing rock and
[49:15.640 --> 49:21.840]  roll music on the radio his crime was not being run by Saudi Arabia and his
[49:21.840 --> 49:27.200]  crime was again the Iran Iraq war they ordered him to launch against Iran that
[49:27.200 --> 49:30.800]  killed several million Iranians and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis that
[49:30.800 --> 49:35.120]  seven eight nine-year war that got him into $40 billion worth of debt he was
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.480]  trying to pay it off and they said hey Saddam we want you to give them these
[49:38.480 --> 49:41.880]  vaccines he said I'm not gonna kill my people not gonna sterilize them and they
[49:41.880 --> 49:50.440]  said well then die punk we took you when you were an army captain at age 20 and
[49:50.440 --> 49:56.080]  trains you for three years in Cairo for your job to break down that country and
[49:56.080 --> 50:03.080]  kill your people and you're gonna do it or you're dead is that clear and by the
[50:03.080 --> 50:07.720]  way the goal they have for America is the exact same goal they have for those
[50:07.720 --> 50:12.440]  Iraqis and that they've got for the Libyans and they've got for the Syrians
[50:12.440 --> 50:17.080]  and they've got for the American people and they've got for the Canadians and
[50:17.080 --> 50:21.480]  they've got for every African every Latin American every Asian everybody on
[50:21.480 --> 50:27.360]  earth is targeted by the new world order and they are not going away they are
[50:27.360 --> 50:32.400]  not standing down they are not backing off they are not quitting and now they're
[50:32.400 --> 50:36.600]  getting ready to downsize the civilian force by a million plus they're getting
[50:36.600 --> 50:40.740]  ready down downsize the armed forces by 200,000 at least and they're going all
[50:40.740 --> 50:44.600]  robots and drones and they're gonna list you as the enemies while praising you
[50:44.600 --> 50:48.200]  that's a that's a high-level psychop veterans are God veterans are God
[50:48.200 --> 50:51.360]  veterans are the best hero ever by the way take their guns they're the terrorists

[54:11.520 --> 54:15.040]  I'm gonna do because I know a lot of people are tuning in because I've asked
[54:15.040 --> 54:17.840]  listeners to call their friends and family I'm gonna go over these letters
[54:17.840 --> 54:20.840]  where they're just saying there's no judge there's no jury we're just gonna
[54:20.840 --> 54:27.440]  say you are now what's the term they use incompetent you know like when you have
[54:27.440 --> 54:31.040]  your 95 year old dad or whatever because you won't stop driving the car you have
[54:31.040 --> 54:34.440]  them declared incompetent make them a ward they're gonna make veterans just in
[54:34.440 --> 54:38.880]  mass wards they're gonna make you serve 5678 tours they're gonna put people on
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.720]  psychotropic that make them go on a wire and then they're gonna use the minority
[54:42.720 --> 54:46.800]  that do bad things it's a small minority veterans still statistically very low
[54:46.800 --> 54:52.240]  crime rate and they're going to take all of your rights while having we salute
[54:52.240 --> 54:57.840]  the troops at the Super Bowl and all those psyops I told you the Mayak and
[54:57.840 --> 55:01.240]  Homeland Security report said veterans the number one terror threat they will
[55:01.240 --> 55:04.840]  attack every city they will attack every department with IEDs that's the
[55:04.840 --> 55:08.200]  manuals and people saw that four years ago and said this can't be real
[55:08.200 --> 55:13.360]  veterans will attack every police department well they're gonna start a
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.960]  civil war they're gonna hunt you down if we let them do this this is outrageous
[55:18.960 --> 55:22.800]  foreign globalists trying to do this then I got all the other news I got
[55:22.800 --> 55:26.800]  Michael Moore saying you shouldn't be able to have any guns get a dog well he
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.400]  has guns on record and five or six bodyguards every time I've seen him I've
[55:30.400 --> 55:35.960]  seen him at the DNC with about let's not exaggerate ten people look like seven
[55:35.960 --> 55:41.080]  more bodyguards three have more entourage what is this about entourage
[55:41.080 --> 55:44.840]  like you haven't arrived you have a big entourage behind you I mean I guess
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.160]  Michael Morris the equivalent of five people himself won't try to be mean it's
[55:49.160 --> 55:54.520]  just it's so hypocritical so we're gonna be talking about that by the way so many
[55:54.520 --> 55:57.960]  times you listen to people you like their music you like their art you like
[55:57.960 --> 56:03.000]  their politics you like what they say and you never imagine you'll ever talk to
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.320]  them and sometimes you talk to them and it's anticlimactic other times it's
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.080]  even better than you thought and I was I was truthful with him I said you know
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.760]  five six seven years ago I disagree with some things you said about the left you
[56:15.760 --> 56:18.480]  know how they should all be thrown in prison because that's tyrannical but
[56:18.480 --> 56:21.680]  now they're saying throw everybody who's a libertarian in prison I understand it
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.640]  was tongue-in-cheek he goes yeah you get it but talk to Michael Savage yesterday
[56:25.640 --> 56:30.960]  and he's on the show next Tuesday next Tuesday with some groundbreaking news
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.680]  and information not just on his new book being censored but so much more this is
[56:35.680 --> 56:41.680]  probably going to be quite a mix quite an explosive mix in a good way because
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.360]  Savage I don't want to say he's reclusive but he doesn't do a lot of media
[56:44.360 --> 56:50.240]  and it's hard to get him on the air and so I am very excited about what is going
[56:50.240 --> 56:54.960]  to be a obviously a newsmaking interview with Michael Savage and the threat he
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.920]  thinks is posed by China infiltrating our government I certainly agree with
[56:58.920 --> 57:05.440]  that but but more he's gonna be almost I think about 40 minutes or so I got to
[57:05.440 --> 57:08.320]  get all that nailed down with the test ISD in line with him and all that having
[57:08.320 --> 57:10.960]  told the producer that I talked to him yesterday afternoon right before his
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.240]  radio show show got it like a 25 30-minute conversation with Michael
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.560]  Savage even smarter in person and because I disagree with some things he said
[57:20.560 --> 57:24.400]  over the years but overall he's a patriot pro-second amendment pro sovereignty
[57:24.400 --> 57:28.520]  been demonized quite a bit banned from going to England but I mean I'm you know
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.360]  it's just it's I can't believe people I get to talk to I mean I'm sitting there
[57:32.360 --> 57:37.160]  for like 25 minutes talking to Michael Savage and he didn't say any of this is
[57:37.160 --> 57:40.640]  off-record but he was saying quite a bit interesting stuff it's just gonna be off
[57:40.640 --> 57:47.640]  record he wants to say it on air he is welcome to but I certainly don't kiss
[57:47.640 --> 57:54.960]  and tell as they say in the journalism business so wow Michael Savage very
[57:54.960 --> 57:58.760]  interesting very very interesting the things we talked about to say the least
[57:58.760 --> 58:02.760]  I mean if that if that was on radio that would be powerful so we'll see what
[58:02.760 --> 58:05.320]  happens next Tuesday and there's some other big stuff gonna happen next week
[58:05.320 --> 58:10.520]  that's even bigger than that kind of guest bigger than Michael Savage if this
[58:10.520 --> 58:15.360]  happens it'll probably be one of the biggest things we ever did and movie
[58:15.360 --> 58:28.360]  grande how do you say dangerous in Spanish Belly grosso movie grande Belly
[58:28.360 --> 58:35.160]  grosso Belly grosso just my life is really like a science fiction movie but

[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:56.920]  India next door or something and you understand if we keep taking all these
[1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:01.400]  people and it lowers the wages it's gonna collapse the economy and that's the
[1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:08.480]  globalist plan it's just so incredible I want to build Mexico up but you don't
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:13.040]  let Mexico an authoritarian country use the US as a steam valve and the
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:18.280]  globalist here want that as part of an North American Union I just have good
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:22.280]  will and know that the globalist are behind all this and it makes me sick so

[1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:06.160]  oh they were just writing about what an incredible manipulator he was and how
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:10.200]  much they loved it but oh you know no Obama's not a puppet master in fact I

[1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:02.640]  started the weekday show is the week night before that where I said I don't
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:06.160]  like stations having to carry brainwashing news so we'll just have
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:10.640]  five minutes where I do the news or cover stuff and then and then all we'll
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:14.680]  have a three minute we'll come in a day after and stations adopt that but they
[1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:18.000]  don't like it so we're gonna leave the whole clock alone except I got to get
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.960]  around to having it reprogrammed John Harmon you should look into that fellow
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:25.080]  running the show right now Minnesota we should look at keeping the exact same
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:28.400]  clock but I'll just do three minutes there until we reprogram it all
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:32.480]  officially with news and then come out at six after don't you think that's the
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:42.680]  way to go buddy okay good yeah we'll get that we'll get that done and then I am

[1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:27.440]  Alex Jones thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen the information I
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:31.360]  have really makes me speechless I knew it was coming but it's moving so fast
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:36.440]  it just blows us away they are sending arbitrary letters to veterans telling
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:41.960]  them they're gonna have to turn their guns in no judge no jury no proof it's
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:45.320]  just like Rahm Emanuel said when he was White House Chief of Staff he said we're
[1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:49.200]  just gonna put whoever we want on a no-gun buy list just like a no-fly list
[1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:55.000]  no judge no jury the ATF is ordering gun shops to file criminal reports on
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.640]  people buying guns so that they have some type of probable cause they're
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:03.440]  claiming it's criminal about two or more rifles or it's suspicious now that's
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:07.960]  outside of law it's already on record that they bought rifles handguns shot
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:14.000]  guns long rifles they do that because under statutory regulations when the
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:19.760]  gun shop reports someone bought the two firearms like it's a criminal report then
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:25.560]  the ATF quote has to act and then they put the gun owner in a database and then
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:29.240]  they have an excuse to come get their records and then basically register you
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:34.520]  and so it's all color of law fraud that's going on but if you go up to
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:41.120]  infowars.com or prisonplanet.com you'll see it linked in red federal
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:45.000]  government moves to disarm veterans and I'm gonna cover this and then I'm gonna
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:50.320]  give the number out I want to hear from veterans specifically and police on this
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:57.800]  subject veterans police active duty only I want to get your quick take on this we
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.280]  knew this was coming for a long time Bill Clinton tried this when he left
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:11.120]  office back in 1999 almost 90,000 I think it was 87,000 troops were told well
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:14.520]  remember in Vietnam when you collapse from heat exhaustion that's now being
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:18.240]  listed in your file as post-traumatic stress you can't own guns no criminal
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:22.320]  record grandfathers you name it I talked to a famous UT football player later
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.160]  became a professional football player he said I could tell the story but not his
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:29.600]  name I was at a birthday party years ago he told me a lot of people would know who
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:33.880]  he is I said his name and he went to buy a 22 for his grandson they said you
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:36.680]  can't buy guns anymore and he went through the thing with lawyers and
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:40.840]  everything they said Vietnam you've got a designation and you can't have guns
[1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:47.520]  anymore that matter of it been 35 40 years this is how this country is now
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.680]  going to be run just like last week and also last year I get a letter saying
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:58.760]  $1,200 in fees somebody put up three signs with infowars.com on them
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:03.280]  homemade you're guilty and I wrote him a letter back and said well what if
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:13.360]  people put Obama signs up do you send him $400 fines per sign and they wouldn't
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:17.440]  respond there's no judge there's no jury there's no citation they say the mayor's
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:21.480]  office you can read the letters and infowars.com has conducted an
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:27.920]  investigation and you will pay or we will put a warrant out for your arrest
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:32.360]  and if you know the law folks there's there's what they're doing is a hardcore
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:37.280]  federal and state felony color of law extortion fraud same thing if I dressed
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:40.740]  up like a cop came to your house and said give me $5,000 you're going to
[1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:45.680]  jail serious felony well when a cop or the government steps out of their
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:49.440]  bounds it's an even more serious felony but Antonio Villa Rigoza you know
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:52.760]  sending people letters you're gonna pay us $1,200 or we're gonna have you
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:59.680]  arrest it no judge no jury no citation no grand jury no indictment no no no
[1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:07.600]  criminal code no court nothing just like the NDAA just like the Patriot Act if
[1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:11.560]  they swore was for al-qaeda only and now they go you know what it is for God
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:16.520]  owners returning veterans libertarians conservatives and born again Christians
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:21.960]  I've got the whole list right here in an incredible article 14 pages long by
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:26.960]  Washington's blog that is the master of aggregating all the proof how many
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:32.760]  rights of Americans really lost and it goes over 14 pages with links to FBI.gov
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:38.360]  that's public and basically every activity is now an act of terrorism you
[1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:41.580]  I'm gonna I'm gonna read some of this after I get into this news and take your
[1:12:41.580 --> 1:12:47.880]  calls but but but but here it is ladies and gentlemen federal government moves
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:51.920]  to disarm veterans it's no secret the Department of Homeland Security
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:56.720]  considers returning veterans a threat to the established order they said as much
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:00.960]  back in 2009 when they wrote in a special report exposed by Alex Jones and
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:04.720]  the alternative media returning veterans post combat skills and
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:10.120]  experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists DHS INA is concerned
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:13.560]  that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:17.600]  order to boost their violent capabilities they go on to say that
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:22.200]  the number one threat following the case of veteran Brandon Robb who was
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:26.440]  abducted for just criticizing Obama and held in a psychiatric ward for Facebook
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:30.520]  post and government considers subversive police in Ohio seized a veterans guns
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:34.320]  after he was adjudicated to be mentally incompetent despite the fact that a
[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:37.880]  veterans administration psychiatric evaluation determined he was not mentally
[1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:42.240]  ill since the veteran is active in the so-called truth movement or patriot
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:48.360]  movement it is assumed involvement this field is part of a reason why he's been
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:52.720]  targeted for psychiatric evaluation Paul Joseph Watson wrote according to
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:56.280]  constitutional attorney Michael Connelly we're going to get on and he has the
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:13:59.960]  official letters the government is now moving to strip veterans it determines
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:04.440]  to be mentally incompetent other second amendment right to own firearms Connelly
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:08.000]  cites a letter sent by the US Department of Veterans Affairs to hundreds
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:13.600]  perhaps thousands it's thousands of America's heroes you're the enemy of
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:16.520]  the foreigners that took this country over a determination of incompetency
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:21.000]  will prohibit you from purchasing possessing receiving or transporting
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.160]  this is from the letter a firearms or ammunition the VA letter states if you
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:28.760]  knowingly violate any of these probations and prohibitions you will be
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:32.720]  fined in prison or both pursuant to the Brady handgun violence prevention act
[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:38.120]  publication L number 103-159 is implemented under 18 United States code
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:43.600]  924-82 now that's a misappropriation of it when Antonio Villara goes to the
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:47.960]  mayor's office and give me $1,200 all arrest you or sue you or give you a bad
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:52.160]  credit report it threatens all three there's no code no nothing so so this
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:57.040]  is even a bigger fraud and again I've confirmed all over the country the
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:01.240]  police show up say you can't be building in that barn well I've always lived here
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:05.120]  well we got horses in there we say it's condemned I see in there you're
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:09.320]  rusted you know well that's not been adjudicated that's not been listen you
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:14.760]  go in there again I'm on arrest you do you understand boy and see they're just
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:21.480]  testing to see what they can do and again people are like why are they doing
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:24.400]  this simultaneously worshipping the veterans well that's to make the
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:28.520]  establishment look good their agenda they use the veterans like wallpaper on
[1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:34.280]  they package it sugar coating on cyanide pill because you can say what you
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:39.840]  want about these wars I know the tropes I'd never been a hind kisser when it
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:43.440]  came to the military until I became older and more sophisticated and found
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:48.320]  out biggest part of my audience is the military because they live in the real
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:51.200]  world folks they see the training for gun confiscation they know about
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:54.200]  government lies and they know I've studied all this and they respect this
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:58.160]  show because they realize I know what I'm talking about they go into classified
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:02.160]  briefings here everything they could see in a video I made 14 years ago because
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:07.160]  I have all the classified sources and and not just classified sources police
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:10.800]  chiefs like LA Philippus who was an army intelligence himself San Antonio police
[1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:16.840]  chief Thomas Sanchez intelligence in Vietnam county manager in Kingsville
[1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:20.640]  Texas they come to him and say we're training for martial law he blows the
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:26.040]  whistle I mean I've talked to hundreds of these people Travis County SWAT team
[1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:29.680]  commander I went and told him what was coming he laughed at me I said all right
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:33.000]  here's my card you call me when they come because I knew they've been going to
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:36.720]  every major city in Texas and I looked at they've been to all the big ones next
[1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:42.640]  had to be Austin and I knew about the program this is a Pentagon infiltration
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:49.040]  of everything and it's not our Pentagon it's far and run the Pentagon's under
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.560]  over the rural affairs commission now with Homeland Security and what do they
[1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:57.960]  train for folks they have rural affairs meetings that are in the news where they
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:01.680]  invite all the old farmers and people in at the local hotel have coffee

[1:23:55.920 --> 1:24:09.960]  preparedness self-reliance and food independence let me break down basically
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:14.080]  what's happened they've taken a Soviet Eastern block takeover model how the
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:19.520]  Soviets would infiltrate and take down a country from within and integrated it
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:23.600]  with Western teaching of how they would counter to try to go into countries and
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:26.840]  keep them from falling to the Soviets or take them over but they're going and
[1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:30.680]  assessing all the police all the military and it's been ongoing for 20
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:35.840]  years but now it's accelerating to the order of 10 and they are going around
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:41.280]  now finding out locally who is gonna not go along with this and again they say
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:47.040]  over-the-top stuff so you'll identify yourself so police that's some good
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:50.640]  intel for you I'm sure you already knew this the common sense if you want to
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:53.960]  stay on the police force act like you hate George Washington and Thomas Jefferson
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:58.360]  and act like you hate freedom if you're in an intelligence unit or a special
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:02.840]  events unit that have been federalized the special response units you're not
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:06.520]  going to get that job unless you just act like a total authoritarian cult
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:10.080]  member but they already they do psychological studies as well I mean
[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:13.280]  they really know who is and who isn't but after they've done that they're now
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:17.920]  expanding to the next group of detectives and managers and captains and
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:21.280]  others and then they're gonna expand as they've done in LA and New York and
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:25.320]  Chicago down to beat cops who are England's already done this they are
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:30.120]  now political enforcers spying sitting in restaurants listening to people it's
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:35.480]  all in the news you'll hear man arrested for racial comment to his wife you're
[1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:38.520]  like well that's racist good arresting you know he said something about foreigners
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:43.760]  it's the end of free speech I mean Michael Savage is banned from entering
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:47.840]  England because he criticized Muslims well I mean isn't that the free speech
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:52.640]  of a European of a Brit of an American whether you agree with a statement or
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:57.200]  not you see that's just an example of this and that's what's now coming here
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:03.040]  and the magnitude let me show you up at info wars.com if you're a TV viewer

[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:46.160]  doing this for 20 years I've been obsessed with this dreaming about it night
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:53.000]  for 17 I know the whole game plan I know it better than the people at the CIA the
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:57.560]  FBI the NSA because 99% of them are compartmentalized there are very few
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:00.600]  people even in the power structure that know how this whole thing's meant to go
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:05.320]  down it's so complex I can't even articulate it to you okay I'm not
[1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:09.640]  bragging about this I know the whole plan because I've probably read 30 bucks
[1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:13.720]  on the Soviets I probably read 10 books on the pre-Soviet era I probably read
[1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:17.680]  15 books on the Zars I probably read a hundred books on the Nazis I probably
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:22.040]  read 50 books on the Vatican I've read 25 or more books on British history on
[1:29:22.040 --> 1:29:26.720]  Roman history on African history I've read probably over a thousand history
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:29.840]  books on these subjects and I know what the globalists are doing and how they've
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:34.200]  integrated all these systems of control you want to start somewhere Heinz

[1:29:52.480 --> 1:30:02.320]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a little over a year ago I
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:06.600]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:10.760]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:14.320]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:18.320]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.840]  painting it'd be like a sinkhole formed out back your house a hundred feet
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:40.920]  deep and you know I'm your neighbor and I call to go hey Sam there's a big hole
[1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:45.000]  in your backyard watch out when you walk out your back door you know Sam's not
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:48.320]  gonna go how dare you fear monger you'll be like wow really that's that noise I
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:55.960]  heard in the night I better go look into this I mean that hole is there and you
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:33:59.840]  can debate how deep it is or who made it or how much worse it's gonna get but
[1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:04.200]  we're in a lot of trouble I mean you add together the two billion plus bullets
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:08.720]  they bought the last year you add the armored vehicles the urban warfare
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:13.160]  training everywhere with the local police helping in the raids I mean this
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:17.080]  is now openly for America for the American people Homeland Security
[1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:20.840]  announced again this year yes the military is gonna respond to domestic

[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:40.600]  district now it's in the Army times it's everywhere and it's wrong and the
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:47.840]  people that are awake are actually our military by and large because they hear
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:52.240]  this show and they know what I'm saying is real and a lot of times they're like
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:55.240]  yes some of this didn't make sense now it all makes sense because I'm not
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:35:00.760]  compartmentalized because I humans act the same and so many of the systems the
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:06.960]  globalists are using are Roman are German are French are British are Russian
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:12.520]  are authoritarian models used before but then overlaid with current

[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:50.880]  calls but I want to say this we're an hour and a half into this broadcast and
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:53.600]  I know the economy shutting down in this country is going to hell in a hand
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:58.840]  basket but we are one of the best and only helps out there there is no I've
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:02.600]  said this many times and actually say this is zero dark 30 because it's true
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:06.680]  they walk into bin Laden unit and I've actually talked to the real folks in
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:10.280]  bin Laden unit were ordered not to kill him over and over again until he died of
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:14.880]  natural kidney failure Colonel Schaefer and others and Steve Pacheneck former
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:21.920]  head psychiatrist of black ops the whole thing I mean it's all fake folks and the
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:26.200]  one of the sub directors walks in and goes listen there is no other secret
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:29.800]  team trying to take out bin Laden this is the only group we're all that's there
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:32.960]  and we're not that good but we're all that's there we've heard me say that a
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:37.960]  hundred times I didn't want to be numero uno I didn't want to be tip of the
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:43.240]  spear but I've got the energy and the will to do it and we now are the biggest
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:48.120]  and really one of the only shows really telling it like it is and it's an
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:52.080]  incredible position of responsibility and I'm not on a power trip over it it's
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:58.040]  the opposite I am humbled to my core and Rich did receive the letter from the VA
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:02.240]  in Keynesia, Connecticut this is out of Washington State saying get ready to
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:08.720]  turn your guns in holy Toledo yeah this is like going to the doctor and they
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.480]  tell you you got cancer I mean this I get a pain not a fear but you know that
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:17.040]  that pain when you get the call your one of your kids is hurt you know you've
[1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:20.400]  we've all gotten that call at work and you're like what is it I don't know your

[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:34.360]  fear it's more of a boom oh man this is this is serious that mmm every day now
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:38.320]  it's mmm for the country oh man they really are gonna hammer down with
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:41.720]  Obamacare and shut down all the jobs and tax the poor people man that's our
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:46.960]  core mmm they really are criminals it's worse than I thought mmm you know it

[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:05.160]  feeling that too and there's a chance we can back these people off but not if we
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:07.960]  don't admit how much trouble we're in okay that's the only thing that's going
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:13.760]  to get this taken care of we got to pray to God to give us guidance as well
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:18.960]  because they can use so many psy ops on us and oh point is I was just in there
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:22.320]  looking at some of the equipment some of the new studios we need to really do
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:26.440]  first-class news the uplinks all the stuff it costs a lot of money to run
[1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:30.600]  this organization I need more personnel I need to pay my personnel I need the
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:35.880]  equipment I need to be able to fight as best I can and that's why it is a war
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:40.680]  bond for the Republic when you go to info wars shop.com or info or store.com
[1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:44.000]  and by appropriate water filters there are the lowest price but let me just get
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.640]  in they should be double price and you should buy them bumper stickers those

[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:13.120]  info war info war store.com we need capital we need capital I'm gonna thank
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:16.080]  everybody that supported us everybody that's gotten the word out for us
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:18.920]  everybody that spread the word about the broadcast all our affiliates are
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:25.680]  sponsors but even though our audience exponentially grows revenue in 2013 is
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:29.320]  down everywhere I know you see the financial papers as well so I know it's
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:32.600]  rough out there but if the people that are still middle-class are wealthy
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:36.400]  because I don't want poor people donating or buying stuff okay I know it
[1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:38.800]  makes you feel good and it's important you want to be part of the effort but
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:44.520]  it's all the tightwads out there that need to get books and videos and Ron Paul
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:48.840]  books father of the tea party and plundered and strategic relocation and
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:53.600]  everything that's available at info warshop.com and get it out to people
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:57.840]  because this is serious business folks if we don't all get aggressive and spend
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:03.240]  time energy and treasure in this fight we're gonna lose it all I'm willing to
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:06.600]  lose my life over this thing I'm not happy about it I'll assure you but there
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:10.520]  is no future we don't beat them I know they can even go out for my family and
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:15.400]  I just you know I don't even pray to God to protect my family actually I do
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:19.920]  sometimes I mainly just pray God whatever your will is just ah yeah please
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:24.160]  help me be more articulate please help others wake up I'm gonna go to your
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:28.680]  calls I'm pretty shook up right now because I knew it was coming they
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:31.520]  announced they were gonna do it and these are not like troops beating their
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:35.640]  wife or troops that got you know caught doing something illegal or this is
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:41.920]  mainline veterans special forces Navy SEALS especially special forces they
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:47.080]  you're the enemy you're a weapon to be decommissioned they're moving to robots
[1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:50.360]  they're moving to drones they don't want you anymore and they're coming after you
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:54.720]  and by the way the Soviets and the Nazis did this after Hitler took over about
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:59.280]  two years later first he called the brown shirts his own his own kind of gang
[1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:06.440]  that took him to power against Rome and then they had crystal night they had
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:09.840]  well that was against Jews they had night of the long knives and then they
[1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:13.800]  had other nights that came a few years later and they they were even arresting
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:19.680]  sergeants from the old Weimar Republic military and the more decorated you were
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:24.840]  the more you were dead Hitler got so paranoid by the end he was just whacking
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:28.920]  everybody listen I'm warning you the Soviets did the same thing mounted the
[1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:35.160]  same thing you do need this is a trap this is a trap you fools all right I
[1:43:35.160 --> 1:43:39.160]  mean this is evil you don't want to be signed on to this okay let's stop right
[1:43:39.160 --> 1:43:42.840]  there and go to your calls rich in Connecticut a vet who said he did receive
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:47.320]  the letter I'm gonna give you our email it's show tips and info wars calm all
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:53.080]  vets blackout your name or cut it out and then mail us your letters so we can
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:57.320]  add them and triple confirm all this rich tell us in Connecticut what you got
[1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:02.680]  in your response to this sir basically when I got the letter from the VA I
[1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:07.480]  honestly I don't really pay attention I I've been a long-time listener this is
[1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:10.080]  my first time calling so I'm a little bit nervous
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:17.880]  anyway um yeah when I received a I don't actually know when I received it back
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:22.480]  off your phone just back off your phone just a bit oh I'm sorry the point is in
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:25.800]  your pile of stuff everybody has that problem in your pile of magazines and
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:32.800]  junk mail you found this go ahead yeah this is after I saw the um on your
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:37.560]  website that people were getting us and I went back through my VA mail usually
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:43.200]  it's just appointments and stuff like that and I had because I'm a hundred
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:52.080]  percent disabled and because of PTSD you know I I got this letter stating that I
[1:44:52.080 --> 1:45:02.720]  was no longer eligible to possess or purchase and by the way PTSD some of it
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:05.800]  is real but the name from a psychologist I've talked to it's pretty much
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:10.960]  most of it's like saying hyper kids have ADHD well no they're drinking soda pop
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:14.760]  and eating junk food all day and bouncing off the walls sugar crashing if I
[1:45:14.760 --> 1:45:18.280]  give my kids sugar they act like satanic demons if I give them healthy food they
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:22.040]  act like angels I mean if I gave my animals my dogs sugar they act like
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:27.880]  maniacs so so the issue is sir you need to fight that I see how they set it up
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:32.400]  we'll give you money if you say you've got a problem and I understand combat
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:35.960]  stress and all that but but I think a lot of it is a hoax I'm not saying in
[1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:40.840]  your case but but please continue well I'm a desert storm veteran I was a
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:46.640]  medic with an infantry unit during desert scar well you probably don't have
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:50.880]  PTSD you probably you were there when chemical detectors went off then yeah
[1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:55.280]  well you got nerve gas buddy you got nerve gas from blowing up chemistry and
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:46:03.360]  other facilities go ahead I'm sorry basically I'm not gonna comply I don't
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:10.000]  I don't I don't give a crap what they say anymore I'm actually you know they
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:14.920]  give you medication that purposely makes you overweight and everything I've been
[1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:21.280]  I have started taking your longevity products the tangy tangerine and stuff
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:30.440]  and that's slim FX is fine direct FX and I've been losing a lot of weight because
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:35.240]  of that and I'm slowly getting off the medication because when I drink the
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:43.480]  tangy tangerine I don't feel like I need the medication I know I started
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:47.240]  taking a few years ago I was so undernourished even though I was eating
[1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:51.160]  healthier food still the soils are depleted that I got high off of it for
[1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:54.240]  like a month and I'm drinking some right now it's funny you brought up the
[1:46:54.240 --> 1:47:00.680]  on tangy tangerine at info or health calm it's just off the chart they just
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:05.920]  had a big Clemson University study about how it kills 95% of cancer cells and
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:09.800]  leaves the healthy cells alone I mean just amazing information and it's
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:13.440]  basically got the research of what Linus Paul and the Nobel Prize winner going
[1:47:13.440 --> 1:47:17.360]  into it along with Dr. Wallach's research and and so much of our problems as I
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:22.000]  just said with ADHD is nutritional kids are eating white bread drinking Coca
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:28.120]  Cola filled with all sorts of chemicals in it and speed caffeine of course you're
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:32.360]  acting like a demon but listen you know these letters are nebulous they're like
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:39.920]  hey you know you may have been ruled incompetent well you're not incompetent
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:45.360]  and so again they're leaving it color of law they're seeing if they can get away
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:47.960]  with this it's like a employee that starts feeling a little bit out of the
[1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:52.240]  cash register and they get away with that a little more a little more a little
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:57.280]  more and they finally get caught so what they're doing is a fraud so I would
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:01.640]  consult with legal counsel that represents veterans let me ask you this
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:08.520]  do you have a criminal record yes I do is it a felony now well then that's a
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:11.760]  non-issue you've got your second amendment they're fraudulently trying to
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:16.520]  apply this do me a favor do you have a scanner to scan that and send it to us
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:26.040]  yeah which the number or they'll give it to me after I'm on a lot sure we can we
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:30.640]  can find we should have a fax number always in hand but we do so few facts
[1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:37.480]  as I don't know if it's hooked up let me do you want our email address well can
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:41.720]  I just send it to one of the editors because it's on the website that if I
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:44.820]  can just send it to one of the editors yeah I just want to know which sure
[1:48:44.820 --> 1:48:50.120]  send it to Curt Nimmo okay it's just show tips everybody's reading that and
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:54.440]  so it has a better chance of getting seen I'm telling you sometimes like some
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:57.800]  famous person will call me and go I've been sitting emails for six months and
[1:48:57.800 --> 1:49:00.800]  then I'll go what's your email and I'll search it and there are all the emails
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:06.200]  and it's just torture because we're trying we're trying to read it all but
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:10.120]  we get like 20,000 emails a day I'm not exaggerating and it's very hard to go
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:13.800]  through them all but everybody just send your letters that you've gotten God
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:17.200]  bless you sir I appreciate your call let's talk to Will in Oklahoma another

[1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:30.160]  other that's what's so diabolical about the following orders of a foreign
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:35.840]  occupying army the globalist the globalist are illegitimate and they're
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:41.560]  now just sending letters to veterans all over the phones are just pouring in the

[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:50.680]  being told yeah come turn your guns in and we're just talking to a gentleman in
[1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:57.040]  Oklahoma will who's a Marine who they experimented with on with the and I
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:00.040]  hear him and it hurts me because he's a smart guy but he's like I can prove they
[1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:03.400]  experimented on me he probably don't even know it was all over the news at the
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:05.960]  time when they were doing these I guess it's three rounds they've done it's
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:09.400]  totally illegal and it's always the doctors that end up saying no at first
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:13.400]  they court martial people and then and then the their lawyers are so dumb they
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:16.760]  don't know what's illegal to give somebody an experimental shot you can't
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:19.800]  make the troops take experimental shots you don't even make them take approved
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:24.200]  shots and they use the troops like guinea pigs and then I've seen them when
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:28.680]  troops are in wheelchairs with legs blown off and their wife is you know a
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:32.440]  teacher or whatever the CPS will come and take their kids we had calls
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:36.880]  yesterday saying well you know you probably got mental problems too since
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:40.840]  your legs are blown off you can't have your three kids and it makes you want to
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:46.840]  cry that while they're praising troops on the news they're targeting them that's
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:52.000]  official I'm not just saying that so will you you have migraines you believe
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:55.800]  from the anthrac shot which is exactly what the kind of stuff it does including

[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:31.880]  always use medical tyranny and the reason I'm jumping in so much when
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:36.960]  there's a caller like this is I know the story and now it's accelerating to tell
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:40.480]  veterans they can't have guns and it's gonna be done with the general public as
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:45.360]  well. What did Alan Dershowitz say he said I believe Alex Jones is mentally ill
[2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:51.520]  he should have his guns taken I'm afraid of that man I have no criminal record
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:59.120]  and almost no misdemeanors. I mean I I'm angry I'm letting my anger be seen to
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:04.120]  try to spur you to get angry to get moving folks but we've got Ronald and

[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:11.920]  we'll finishing up with you how did this end were they able to to get your guns
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:18.160]  well no they weren't in fact you know my wife she yes she takes medications but
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:21.400]  it's none of their business what she takes the medication for and we I
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:25.320]  specifically told them that even though even my wife stepped in instead. Well
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:28.360]  that's why under Obamacare they share it with all the agencies now so they have
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:34.760]  all the medical records. Right well and so anyway so that you know it he says
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:39.120]  well we got to put this up for review and of course the guy left and got my
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:42.760]  letter and mail later on because I kept receipts of everything that I do as far
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:46.880]  as I pay my bills and my main my main thing why I wanted to call you is to
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:52.040]  let these vets know that when they're getting out they need to be very very
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:55.880]  big on the box everything they do when they pay their bills they need to keep
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:01:59.280]  records of it they need to yeah because they're gonna declare you in
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:02.240]  compliment it's like putting you in prison that's why they wanted to say
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:06.840]  your wife was incompetent that they want to list you basically as a terrorist
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:10.460]  God bless you sir I got to jump to the next caller good to hear from you and

[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:18.880]  Green Beret somebody you know was commanding a hundred people and on the
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:24.240]  ball at a thousand percent higher than the gibbering you know VA generally some

[2:02:35.400 --> 2:02:40.320]  in folks will do whatever they're told and so I've talked all the VA people
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:44.160]  about what they witness I heard the same story over and over again and they're
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:47.520]  just totally incompetent they'll cut off the wrong leg you know give them the
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:51.040]  wrong medication but they're gonna come and tell you you're mentally ill you're

[2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:06.400]  more power and call for a bank of the world as they were doing again yesterday
[2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:10.880]  and what funds it carbon taxes and what's the new Secretary of State Kerry
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:15.760]  say in his first speech two days ago we need that carbon tax to save the earth

[2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:42.360]  wanted to intro that they're now sending veterans everywhere letters saying no
[2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:46.080]  more gun rights for you no judge no jury they're not even been designated as
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:50.800]  mentally ill you just heard that bullying story last hour a guy called in
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:55.000]  saying I had PTSD but I started taking beyond Tangierine and now I'm not I'm
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:59.720]  not freaking out well it wasn't PTSD it's it's like you know all these
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:04.960]  behavioral problems the ADHD you get the kids off red dye and sugar and candy and

[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:13.000]  kids processed sugar we're out of the event okay birthday party have a piece
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:16.600]  of cake they're a demon the rest of the day don't ever give them cakes and stuff
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:22.920]  and processed stuff they're angels I mean it is it is like clockwork ADHD give
[2:16:22.920 --> 2:16:26.080]  them give them speed to burn their brain out give them give them give them
[2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:29.800]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors I mean what do you think from what you just
[2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:35.600]  heard again you are a natural drug formulator compounding pharmacist
[2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:39.240]  before that a mainline pharmacist one of the most successful there in Colorado
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:42.320]  Ben Fuchs introducing for those that don't know who he is he works and
[2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:47.400]  advises us at info wars health.com or info wars team.com but what did you
[2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:50.840]  just think of what you just heard there's so many ways you can go with this
[2:16:50.840 --> 2:16:53.840]  first of all post-traumatic stress syndrome is something that we're all
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:16:57.880]  dealing with because we're all being traumatized and we all have stress and
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:01.840]  even though according to the world world health organization there's 12,000
[2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:05.880]  different diseases there's really only one disease and that is the disease of
[2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:10.960]  traumatic stress and what our veterans are experiencing are an exaggerated
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:15.840]  version of what we're all experiencing which is why the single most important
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:19.840]  strategy for restoring yourself back to health and wellness is to tell the body
[2:17:19.840 --> 2:17:24.080]  via nutritional supplementation via oxygenation via correct foods via
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:30.040]  detoxification to tell the body that all is okay that all is right in the world
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:33.880]  when the body perceives that it is under stress there is that there is a
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:38.320]  trauma there's a trauma that's occurring it will begin to shut down growth
[2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:42.800]  processes healing processes and repair processes and if we wanted to design a
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:48.240]  society that was systematically specifically set up to cause stress and
[2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:52.000]  trauma and shut down the growth and repair system we couldn't do a better
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:55.880]  job if we tried to do it intentionally and we very well might be doing it
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:18:00.400]  intentionally fluoride in the water preservatives and foods excitotoxins
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:06.160]  processed foods processed breads and grains purified sugars these all
[2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:10.400]  exacerbate the stress response in the body when the body is under stress it
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:14.080]  doesn't do its best work it doesn't heal it doesn't start with us what would you
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:17.320]  do with vets that they've got on serotonin reuptake inhibitors who are
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:21.760]  not eating good food who are on 700 bucks a month all these special
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.480]  forces heroes who the government hates so much but says they're heroes all day
[2:18:25.480 --> 2:18:29.840]  what would you begin to do if you were one of those guys first and foremost I
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:34.240]  would I would have these people activating their relaxation chemistry the
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:37.840]  body's got two kinds of chemistry it's got relaxation chemistry and it has
[2:18:37.840 --> 2:18:42.120]  stress chemistry and for the vast majority of our chemistry needs to be in
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:46.720]  the relaxation mode the stress mode is only for emergencies so we got to figure
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:50.360]  out not just for our vets for all of us we have to figure out how to access this
[2:18:50.360 --> 2:18:54.640]  relaxation chemistry and the good news is it's not expensive the good news is you
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:58.400]  can do it for free the system won't tell you they overdrive they get into a
[2:18:58.400 --> 2:19:02.560]  stress economy we all do it especially professionals and then they can never get
[2:19:02.560 --> 2:19:05.600]  out of it you've got to learn how to get into a joking economy that's why I do
[2:19:05.600 --> 2:19:09.680]  that sometimes you've got to learn to go out and have fun as well and they
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:13.640]  don't want people to know there's a cure I'll tell you one of the simplest easiest
[2:19:13.640 --> 2:19:17.680]  ways to activate relaxation chemistry the biggest emergency to the body is
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:22.240]  lack of oxygen it's technically called hypoxia low levels of oxygen when the
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:26.360]  body gets low levels of oxygen it feels like it's death is imminent anytime I
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:30.440]  get down I just go out and climb a mountain something as simple as exercise
[2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:34.480]  and deep breathing techniques can send the message the biochemical message to
[2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:37.800]  the body that all is right in the world and can begin to activate the the
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:41.400]  relaxation response and the healing and growth and repair response for folks who
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:45.560]  are dealing with PTSD just experiment try this deep breathing techniques for
[2:19:45.560 --> 2:19:50.120]  60 seconds it won't cost you anything and in 60 seconds your blood pressure will
[2:19:50.120 --> 2:19:53.680]  drop your blood will start to thin you'll get more nutrients to your organs
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:57.440]  and let's all deep breathe during the break let's do it I'm serious folks let's

[2:24:11.400 --> 2:24:20.160]  racial division on MSNBC and see it in all they want us to do is go on killing
[2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:23.520]  one another coming up the next segment I'm gonna hit a few news stories for we
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:27.760]  go back to Ben Fuchs in your calls like Obama administration moves forward on
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:32.480]  climate change without Congress and that means shutting down our power plants
[2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:36.920]  and not letting new ones be opened when you take over a country like a world war
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:41.560]  two that you fly in and bomb the power plants I mean this is folks they're
[2:24:41.560 --> 2:24:44.440]  going to make you poor they're gonna make you go on government assistance so
[2:24:44.440 --> 2:24:49.040]  they can run your life like these veterans and it is just and I see the
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:52.880]  first commenter in this article in US News and World Report that's linked on
[2:24:52.880 --> 2:24:56.200]  drudge how stupid is it to kill off the energy source without a replacement
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:59.040]  liberals never see the big picture when it has to do with technology and
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:05.960]  numbers no it's not about not seeing the big picture they're not liberals they
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:09.920]  the globalists have all moved their investments to China who has no standards
[2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:15.280]  they're increasing the value of their investments by shutting us down just like
[2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:18.840]  General Electric its waivers on all this domestically they can have new
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:23.080]  plants and expand old plants and put out all the CO2 they want but everybody
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:28.360]  else has to cut it in half which is impossible I'm sorry Ben Fuchs going
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:31.160]  back to you brother so for vets out there and then we'll get into all this
[2:25:31.160 --> 2:25:38.120]  other news breathing exercises basic exercise not eating MSG not eating
[2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:42.800]  aspartame I mean it just the whole society's falling apart it's all coming
[2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:47.320]  out even CBS News oh aspartame does give you diabetes you were talking about that
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:51.400]  on the show a month ago Ben you know here's so here's the idea there's this
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:55.760]  notion that's to take care of yourself and to to stay healthy it's gonna cost
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:25:59.240]  you a lot of money it's gonna take a lot of work the message that I want people
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:03.840]  to understand is it is simple and easy to restore your body back to health
[2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:08.760]  because it's in the body's nature to heal every time you cut yourself you are
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:11.880]  witness to this healing process you don't have to think about it you don't have
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:14.880]  to take any special potions you don't need any prescription drugs the skin
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:20.240]  just does its duty it heals itself when you break a bone the place where you
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:24.800]  broke it is stronger after it heals and it was before it broke not only is it in
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:30.120]  the body's nature to heal itself it's in the body's nature to get stronger when
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:33.760]  it is under certain amounts of stress this is how exercise now they're trying
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:37.080]  to get rid of vaginal birth someday it'll be a conspiracy that women ever
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:40.680]  had babies period they'll be grown in tanks let me tell you about the disaster
[2:26:40.680 --> 2:26:45.280]  of cesarean sections when a baby is born he is coated with bacteria and that
[2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:50.280]  bacteria become that baby's personal microbiome for producing vitamins and
[2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:54.560]  detoxifying food and and processing anything that the kid eats for the rest
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:26:58.280]  of his life a baby that's born non-vaginally through cesarean section
[2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:02.600]  is going to be compromised at the digestive system level for life he's
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:05.560]  going to be running higher risks for degenerative disease and this is a
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:08.920]  baby that's going to be forced to interact with the men they don't want
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:12.080]  them getting the colostrum that is every immunity the woman and her entire
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:15.960]  genetic line had an entire vaccination all the way back to the beginning of
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:19.440]  humanity don't get that either that's right and then there are how many babies
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:22.320]  how many mothers are told to give their babies formula because there's not
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:26.520]  enough nutrients in breast milk I just got a Facebook message from a guy who
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:29.680]  said just that he went to the doctor the doctor said well breast milk's okay but
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:33.440]  there's not enough nutrients in it we need to give you a b12 and floor we
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:37.400]  need to give your baby a b12 and fluoride injection folks this is not only
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:43.000]  stupidity and bad science and bad biochemistry is killing us it's costing
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:47.360]  us our quality of life it's so tragic and it's so unnecessary if you do things
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:50.680]  like number one practice deep breathing number two get on a nutritional
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:54.080]  supplement program number three not interacting with the corporate
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:58.280]  domesticating food the food that gets us fat and the food that keeps us dumb
[2:27:58.280 --> 2:28:02.680]  and stupid simple things like that can restore ourselves back to health because
[2:28:02.680 --> 2:28:07.560]  it's the way the body is constructed it's the divine force at work and it
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:14.160]  doesn't need our help it simply needs raw materials to do its work amazing now
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:20.240]  my neck my face my arms my legs have all gotten smaller but I don't follow the
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:25.200]  whole m4s health comm longevity program I'm trying to my belly has stayed the
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:29.280]  same size and a lot of evidence is I guess I'm still eating gluten and I
[2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:32.920]  guess I've got the wheat belly you know the it's a stress response that we're
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:36.360]  talking about to the body is only two kinds of stresses Alex there's the
[2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:39.960]  stress of eating being eaten by a saber-toothed tiger or a lion and there's
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:43.720]  the stress of starvation so what the body will do when it's under stress and it
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:46.600]  doesn't know that there's stress from the government and stress from the IRS and
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:49.640]  stress from our families and stress from our our foods it just thinks we're
[2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:53.760]  going to be eaten by a tiger or we're going to starve so number one it will
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:57.320]  send us out on a one-pointed hunt for food and it'll put that food on our
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:01.520]  bellies it'll store it as fat and it won't allow us to lose it lose that
[2:29:01.520 --> 2:29:05.120]  fat because it thinks a famine is about to approach number two it's going to
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:08.400]  activate the chemistry that will protect us from being eaten by a saber-toothed
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:12.320]  tiger number one it's going to divert blood from the digestive system and from
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:17.800]  from the brain into the legs into the so that we can run and number two it's
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:21.200]  going to clot the blood and it's going to cause hypertension so we don't bleed
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:24.600]  to death and when you think about it all of the diseases that we're suffering
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:28.200]  from all the degenerative diseases that we're suffering from are the result of
[2:29:28.200 --> 2:29:33.120]  lack of circulation stagnation blood clotting obesity and oh by the way you
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:37.240]  can throw in a shrinking of the brain the intellectual centers of the brain
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:42.520]  and a slowing down of the immune system was a big study on that geneticist where
[2:29:42.520 --> 2:29:48.960]  the IQ is dropping across the world it's no surprise no surprise Alex stay

[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:36.440]  the GMO well I mean the general public's eating GMO aspartame artificial
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:42.360]  sweeteners you know the McDonald's food and others has the silicone in it I mean
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:46.760]  what they can get away with putting in food all this is out there now our
[2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:52.440]  longevity is dropping the cancer is exploding the diabetes all of this and
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:57.240]  society's falling apart what would you begin with I'm gonna give you the floor
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:00.520]  right now for the next 10 minutes before we go to calls and news what would you go
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:04.200]  through and what are our biggest health issues and what exactly is wrong with the
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:08.280]  medical model why are we falling apart what can we do about it why do we need
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:12.760]  to supplement what does weight loss occur as a byproduct of supplementation
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:16.680]  what is the problem with fluoride you've got the floor all right the biggest
[2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:20.640]  problem that we're dealing with is what you've been talking about for the last
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:24.480]  couple hours this idea of post-traumatic stress syndrome post-traumatic stress
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:29.600]  syndrome simply means that we're stressed after trauma from birth forward
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:34.520]  the human body is attacked with things like fluoride in the water excitotoxins
[2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:40.400]  in the food nutritionally deficient foods sugar etc etc etc not to mention
[2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:45.800]  pharmaceutical drugs and met deadly medical procedures it's it makes perfect
[2:35:45.800 --> 2:35:48.800]  sense that we would be we would all be dealing with a type of post-traumatic
[2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:53.360]  stress so the first and most important thing we can do if we're dealing with a
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:57.880]  degenerative disease or to prevent degenerative disease is to figure out how
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:02.440]  to tell the body that we are safe that everything is okay from a from a
[2:36:02.440 --> 2:36:06.320]  survival standpoint and the first thing you need to do or we need to do is
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:09.920]  understand the breathing processes we talked about before the biggest
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:15.240]  emergency to the body from a physical standpoint is lack of oxygen over time
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:21.120]  as we are bombarded with stress we begin to contract our body and by the time
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:25.000]  we're in our 20s or 30s we're filled with these microscopic little
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:30.920]  contractions there are pools of hypoxia pools of low oxygen and these pools of
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:35.320]  low oxygen accumulate and the body over time believes that it's about to die so
[2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:38.800]  the first and most important thing we can do to activate the body's relaxation
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:43.520]  chemistry healing chemistry built-in healing chemistry is to deep breathe and
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:46.800]  to blow off carbon dioxide and I want to beat this to death but this is that's
[2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:51.120]  probably the single most important thing we can do the second most important
[2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:55.880]  thing we can do is to figure out how to eat less calories and get more
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:37:00.720]  nutrients the average American diet is the exact opposite it's more calories
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:04.120]  and less nutrients and you and I have talked about this before when the body
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:09.440]  gets calories without nutrients it continues being hungry we have a shutoff
[2:37:09.440 --> 2:37:13.960]  center in our brain an appetite suppressant center in our brain and this
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:17.960]  appetite suppressant center in the brain is dependent on
[2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:23.600]  nutrients and protein and to a certain extent fats as well so making sure that
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:26.520]  you're getting enough protein making sure you're getting enough fats in the
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:30.360]  form of essential fatty acids and saturated fats by the way like coconut
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:35.040]  oil and making sure that you're getting enough micronutrients is the second most
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:38.680]  important strategy that you can use and not only is it an important strategy for
[2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:42.800]  helping turn on the relaxation chemistry but it's a wonderful strategy for
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:47.120]  building your immune system and allowing your body to lose weight naturally in
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:51.280]  fact as you know one of the most common effects of nutritional supplementation
[2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:54.360]  with the beyond tangy tangerine and the young Jebedee products is weight loss
[2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:58.280]  and we don't even talk about weight loss as being a benefit from using the
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:01.760]  beyond tangy tangerine it's just a natural effect of nutritional
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:08.080]  supplementation the third most important strategy that we can use is to refuse to
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:14.200]  interact with the corporate machine that could care less about our health your
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:18.640]  doctor the medical model the corporate medical model corporate food these
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:24.280]  people have no could care less whether we live or die as long as they extract
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:28.240]  our money to refuse to interact with the McDonald's of the world the Taco Bells
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:34.560]  of the world the Kaisers of the world the to refuse to participate in their
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:39.080]  scam is the third most important strategy that we can use and let me tell
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:43.280]  you something when we drive when we pass by McDonald's we don't want to be
[2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:46.940]  driving through we want to be driving by and as we're driving by we want to be
[2:38:46.940 --> 2:38:50.880]  giving them the finger because they are truly the enemy of humanity and if we
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:54.760]  participate in eating the fast food and eating the corporate swill and not
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:58.800]  the supplementing using a nutritional supplement nutritional supplement
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:04.680]  program we are complicit in our own demise the third thing drink more water
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:10.320]  clean water filtered water and stay away from toxic fluoride whether it's in the
[2:39:10.320 --> 2:39:12.920]  form of toothpaste or whether it's in the form of drinking water one of the
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:17.720]  most insidious ways that we pollute that our humanity is being polluted is by
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:22.680]  fluoride in the drinking water for babies if you go to Walgreens or these drugs
[2:39:22.680 --> 2:39:28.280]  right aid is drug stores and convenience stores you'll find nursery
[2:39:28.280 --> 2:39:35.000]  water which is packed with fluoride how a mother can voluntarily give their baby
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:39.560]  toxic fluoride in this in I gotta stop you on this because you're nice and say
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:43.120]  they may be doing it on purpose they're eugenicist I've got all the
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:48.320]  globalist bragging how we deserve it the journal of pediatrics the American
[2:39:48.320 --> 2:39:53.720]  Medical Association the American dental Association were forced six years ago to
[2:39:53.720 --> 2:39:57.920]  say that under five should not drink fluoride and should not brush with
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:02.440]  fluoride because they had to admit the cancer and the dental fluorosis it is a
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:08.160]  fact that it reduces IQ it is and they put huge amounts of three or four parts
[2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:11.760]  per million in that and we forced them what last year to finally cut it from
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:18.400]  1.3 to 0.7 parts per what is it million or billion they had to cut basically in
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:23.440]  half the amount or write a little bit more than half of what they put in the
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:28.360]  water and they're banning it as a pesticide now because it bio accumulates
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:33.600]  I mean this is the ultimate hoax this chemical weapon in the hydrofluorosilic
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:38.560]  acid range which makes the sodium fluoride which you do need a tiny amount
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:43.720]  of hyper poisonous and cumulative and stick in your bones I mean come on
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:47.320]  pharmacist Ben Fugues that's on purpose well you know one of the best ways to
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:50.520]  protect ourselves from fluoride is to make sure you're getting enough
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:53.680]  nutritional supplements especially iodine especially vitamin C and
[2:40:53.680 --> 2:40:57.960]  especially vitamin E and by the way this whole notion of iodized salt and all
[2:40:57.960 --> 2:41:00.960]  we need is a tiny little bit of iodine and in our salt and we won't get
[2:41:00.960 --> 2:41:05.920]  quitter is a another health scam that does this service to the human race
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:10.080]  iodine is not just a thyroid hormone it's a critical hormone for the pineal
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:14.760]  gland which is like a fluoride vacuum cleaner if you're getting fluoride and
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:17.360]  you're giving your kids fluoride and you're not getting enough iodine you
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:22.280]  are guaranteeing that your pineal gland will be shrunken and atrophy like an
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:25.680]  old man by the time you're 10 by the time you were your kid is 10 or 12 years
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:29.840]  old so making sure that you're taking care of nutritional supplements is once
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:33.960]  again one of the best ways to protect yourself against toxicity by the way
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:37.400]  when it comes to water there's not just fluoride in the water Alex there's
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:41.760]  measurable amounts of cardiovascular medications of calcium channel blockers
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:46.400]  and of antidepressants in the winds other psychotropic medications in the
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:50.840]  water I was just reading an article this morning that talked about fish having
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:55.800]  autism genes turned on by being sub by swimming in water that has
[2:41:55.800 --> 2:42:00.680]  antipsychotic and anti medication antidepressant medication in it literally
[2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:06.600]  fish have genes autism genes and those genes get turned on by being by having
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:10.240]  the fish swimming in antidepressant laden water and this is the kind of stuff
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:13.200]  that we're drinking not to mention if you're if you go ahead and voluntarily
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:17.240]  take an antidepressant or or an antipsychotic drug and this whole idea by
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:21.600]  the way of Prozac and serotonin reuptake inhibitors is one of the biggest
[2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:26.240]  scandals in a whole litany of scandals of just a moment because this is so
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:30.360]  incredible last week Melissa Melton on the nightly news covered the London
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:35.280]  Guardian big studies headline fish committing suicide because of serotonin
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:39.040]  reuptake inhibitors in the water they will swim right up to bigger fish and
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:43.360]  be eaten they will swim right up into people's nets and what did they report
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:49.680]  five years ago in a federal study shrimp committing suicide because of Prozac
[2:42:49.680 --> 2:42:57.440]  prozac type drugs but here's the deal they're finding a a generic form of
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:43:02.280]  Prozac in water supplies at levels higher than that should be even for
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:06.720]  runoff bin they're jacking the water with Prozac there it is pharmacological
[2:43:06.720 --> 2:43:10.080]  waste runoff causing shrimp and other marine life to commit suicide now
[2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:14.440]  that's from 2012 you guys have got to pull up I remember the exact headline
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:19.920]  like fish committing suicide on Prozac I mean of course I'm sorry go ahead you
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:24.040]  hit the nail on the head it with those two words of course we cannot expect
[2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:27.760]  anything to be different look if you're on a prescription medication if
[2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:30.840]  anybody out there is on a prescription medication take that medication and
[2:43:30.840 --> 2:43:35.280]  instead of swallowing it chew it let that medication hit your taste buds in
[2:43:35.280 --> 2:43:39.360]  your tongue it will taste like the most toxic repulsive poison you could ever
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:44.280]  imagine and the reason is it is the most toxic repulsive poison that you could
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:47.480]  ever imagine and the fact that you're taking it in small enough doses that
[2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:52.560]  you don't notice a big-time emergency poison response doesn't make that stuff
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:58.120]  less poisonous how can we have a health care system manned by health care
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:04.080]  professionals who are sworn to do no harm that lives and subsists and does its
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:10.000]  work by poisoning people purportedly back to health where does this notion come
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:14.640]  from that we can pharmaceuticalize ourselves back to health and wellness
[2:44:14.640 --> 2:44:18.600]  alex the word pharmaceutical itself farmico comes from the root word for
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:23.760]  what poison you're literally if we are taking these medications and there's
[2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:28.520]  four billion of them prescriptions served every year annually in this
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:32.840]  country alone and untold billions around the world if we voluntarily
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:37.720]  participate in taking these poisons we are complicit in our own demise and
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:41.840]  folks let me tell you something nutrients are what drugs dream they
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:47.200]  could be when a drug goes to bed at night and has a fantasy it fantasizes
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:51.840]  its vitamin C or vitamin E or vitamin A because these substances have the
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:56.400]  medicinal properties of the pharmaceutical agents with zero toxicity
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:00.000]  zippo zero they keep trying to find people who die or have some kind of
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:04.600]  toxic response to nutrients and they can't find them because it never
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:09.640]  happens yet we want to have more and more regulation on nutrients we want to
[2:45:09.640 --> 2:45:14.720]  have in the coming years we probably will have doctors tell us what kind and
[2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:17.680]  how much vitamins and nutrients we could take and let me tell you that's what
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:21.920]  they're pushing through the whole UN deal that that's a codex thing that's
[2:45:21.920 --> 2:45:25.800]  exactly right and in some countries it's already started in Germany and in
[2:45:25.800 --> 2:45:29.600]  Canada and in France you can only get small amounts of vitamin C you can only
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:33.160]  get small amounts of vitamin A and if you want more you got to have a doctor
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:37.160]  officially write you a prescription and while we're on this oh yeah mercs now
[2:45:37.160 --> 2:45:40.640]  coming out just a few days ago officially saying you don't just need

[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:34.880]  cross the point is is that it's the same thing genetically Asians especially

[2:53:02.680 --> 2:53:06.200]  nutritional counseling I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:10.200]  their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage so whether it is poor memory
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:14.240]  or focus lack of creative thinking or more serious matters like inability to
[2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:17.960]  focus speak normally or remember things the emphasis to getting one's brain

[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:41.360]  all right here's how this works for about 12 years I did three hours of radio
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:48.720]  11 to 2 central 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern and then I always had more to cover so
[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:54.880]  for about three years I did a fourth hour and then I did that fourth hour for
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:54:57.960]  couple years I started doing the nightly news and trying to manage all these
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:01.920]  things and I just it was it was taking all my energy so I cut back the fourth
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:07.320]  hour but still stations were carrying it and so I started you know still doing it
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:11.840]  part of the time or at least part of it and XM so we can't carry four hours
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:16.120]  we'll carry your second third and fourth well really that's not the live hour so
[2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:19.680]  XM figured that out and said well we'll try to figure out how to pick up your
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:24.200]  first hour now at 11 a.m. but that hasn't happened yet so people need to let XM know
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:32.880]  you're subscribing on 166 to be able to hear this show and that you want to hear
[2:55:32.880 --> 2:55:36.160]  the first hour but a lot of our affiliates do carry the fourth hour
[2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:39.720]  because they can't carry the first because of shows they already have so
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:45.560]  it's the first hour a lot of times the best my most focused and cogent is then
[2:55:45.560 --> 2:55:48.880]  reared the fourth hour most days but a lot of days I go into that fourth hour
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:52.760]  it's kind of a specialty hour I'm gonna have been fused because the guy's
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:57.880]  amazing and he really knows his stuff cover the gut the heart the skin the
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:02.440]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors first I'm gonna let him have the floor at about
[2:56:02.440 --> 2:56:05.600]  10 minutes into the next hour I'll introduce him and stuff and let him
[2:56:05.600 --> 2:56:10.440]  roll and then if he wants to take calls or something too we could do that I've
[2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:14.580]  got some vets that are holding right now so let's get to them a vet in name
[2:56:14.580 --> 2:56:18.640]  Brian in Pennsylvania said he did receive the letters again if you just

[3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:58.000]  till about 10 at night I felt like I've been run over and it was the end of the
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:02.600]  world driving home and I woke up the next morning feeling like I'd come out of
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:07.400]  a cracker jack box you know like the jack-in-the-box I felt great popping out
[3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:11.680]  of the top it's normal you know they have school kids do you feel depressed ever
[3:01:11.680 --> 3:01:16.200]  do you ever get anxious well you need to go on drugs that's normal it's normal to
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:19.800]  learn how to deal with that stuff I used to have so much anxiety as a kid and
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:23.880]  even as a teenager now I wish I had more anxiety sometimes I'm totally calm
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:28.400]  about stuff behind the scenes really big dangerous stuff I've just learned to
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:32.800]  just deal with it that's part of becoming seasoned and becoming an adult
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:37.880]  they want arrested development let's go to the troops the veterans about the
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:41.440]  official letters being sent out it appears to most veterans saying you can
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:45.560]  no longer own guns no judge no jury you are incompetent you are no longer a
[3:01:45.560 --> 3:01:50.880]  person Jim and Florida what's your quick take on this thanks for holding yeah
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:57.200]  how you doing Alex a good to talk to you brother I've been with you since day

[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:15.240]  give a message to the American public it is not going to happen
[3:02:15.240 --> 3:02:20.160]  you're well every veteran I talked to in their public as well they're not
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:26.280]  turning their guns in they're saying fine you want a war get one yeah I'm I'm
[3:02:26.280 --> 3:02:34.960]  disabled 100% I'm a Marine and I served in Vietnam and that was my wake-up call
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:42.120]  and I've been with you and everybody else since I came back from Vietnam you
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:49.040]  know doing my part so I go out and I have people that approach me and tell me
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:56.920]  their life story that they should never tell anybody okay and and like I say the
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:02.120]  message is it's not going to happen and I want people out here everything Alex
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:08.360]  tells you is the truth okay and you better all pay attention and get up off
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:16.320]  your thing and get involved in the fight burn DVDs pass them out mail them out
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:24.080]  use that email and get in this fight for your freedoms because nobody in their
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:31.320]  right mind is going to relinquish their freedoms that we bought for especially
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:37.120]  the veterans and thank you and your crew and everybody that you have come on your
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:43.720]  show and we pray for you and your family every day wow wow that's humbling man

[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:51.240]  break jam in one more after that from Chad and then that's you know we got
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:54.080]  calls for Ben Fuchs after that that he'll be able to go to after he covers
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:59.480]  some news 800-25 at 99231 one more call from Chad a two-minute report by
[3:03:59.480 --> 3:04:03.160]  Jacari Jackson on the veterans and then I'm going to turn over the next 50
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:06.880]  minutes roughly or so 45 minutes to Ben Fuchs because this medical stuff is
[3:04:06.880 --> 3:04:11.400]  important and we were talking about stuff we're selling as well that's that's
[3:04:11.400 --> 3:04:16.800]  only part of it but that's what funds us so infoworthshealth.com see that's why
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:20.320]  I interrupt sometimes when somebody's talking because I'll know they don't
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:22.720]  know the stuff I know and it's frustrating I want to go let me guess
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:26.240]  and then this happened yeah how'd you know because the globalists are following
[3:04:26.240 --> 3:04:31.600]  handbooks somebody can call me from England or Australia or Germany of what
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:33.960]  they're going through with government and I go and let me guess then this
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:37.680]  happened they're like yeah how do you know that because it's not hard it's an
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:46.560]  it's a playbook it's a manual it's standard operating procedure and they're
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:50.920]  trying to demonize the veterans it is so it just proves how criminal these
[3:04:50.920 --> 3:04:56.200]  people are and we don't want this civil war to take place by the way the
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:04:58.920]  globalist are still going forward with their plans but they're losing right

[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:30.120]  have no second moment right you are the enemy if you don't turn them in a young
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:34.320]  SWAT team is waiting to come and kill you basically and that's what they trained
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:38.280]  for that the vets are the number one enemy and now it's all official Chad in
[3:10:38.280 --> 3:10:43.120]  California you're on the air last caller from the vets hi Alex how you doing
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:48.120]  pretty good all right hey I don't want to pick apart what the federal government
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:53.360]  decides to do I think you do a outstanding job at doing that I haven't
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:58.480]  received my letter yet but I'm anticipating it I'm I am a disabled
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:04.200]  veteran my health is dwindling and I just need a moment an uninterrupted moment
[3:11:04.200 --> 3:11:08.720]  of the air so I can read something that I feel like will touch sure all those
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:14.480]  warplies okay all right it's called in the eyes of a wounded warrior images of
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:19.040]  one hanging his head chaos amongst the living carrying the dead once bitten
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:24.400]  twice shy ready to live and ready to die storming on the inside bullets flying
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:29.320]  where I hide dilated pupils are pounding this filling in my gut tension
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:34.040]  mounting floating metal dropping fire and discriminate blood under the tire
[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:41.120]  these events arranged forever changed welcome back mind re-arranged controlled
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:45.720]  mind blood splatters red cross message loved ones heart shatter happy war
[3:11:45.720 --> 3:11:50.240]  machine pockets got fatter thoughts of the mundane driving pain it's insane
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:56.040]  suit and tie sentence to die for a lie church excuses creating this mess abandon
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:12:01.000]  little boy consciousness penny less well-being thrown in the ditches polluted
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:05.040]  humanity for false riches trading your guilt and shame for camera fame
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:10.280]  manipulated words war is a lame state of mind not a game executive decision to
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:17.800]  kill please forgive me haven't had my will that's it all right well what do you
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:20.120]  think the veterans are going to do is they're told that they are quote
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:24.880]  incompetent and told your wife has to run your finances or maybe she's mentally
[3:12:24.880 --> 3:12:29.640]  ill too and we're going to take your kids and they've done nothing and now
[3:12:29.640 --> 3:12:35.040]  they're the hunted ones in homeland security was always set up for them well
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:40.760]  I think that the first amendment is our freedom of speech a right to assembly and
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:43.920]  if we are taking that if that one is taken away we have the second amendment
[3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:47.880]  and that's what I think about that open like an American also now known as a
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:51.840]  terrorist thank you for the call and again it's it's it's it's former
[3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:55.720]  military mainly their police who are now going to go harass them the military
[3:12:55.720 --> 3:12:59.560]  and then as soon as they're done with you cops are going to take your guns too
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:06.560]  and it's just incredible that I've known for 11 years homeland security was set
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:10.440]  up for the troops I've known that and I've said that I put it in films and I've
[3:13:10.440 --> 3:13:15.000]  warned you and I've broken it down and I've studied authoritarianism I'm not
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:20.560]  patting myself in the back my point is this is real and we have ruthless
[3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:24.360]  globalists that 13 years ago and 99 signed deals that were in Bloomberg a
[3:13:24.360 --> 3:13:27.800]  few years ago in AP where the death benefits of troops where they tell you
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:30.800]  oh sign here to have some of your check taken out for life insurance for your
[3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:34.200]  family they signed a deal with Prudential and others just to take all that money
[3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:39.080]  and they said well we got it what we got the veterans affairs to agree and
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:42.560]  that's why they can say we're gonna hold up your back pay until you agree to say
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:46.280]  you have a psychological problem go on these drugs we're gonna catch you to
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:49.880]  make sure you're on those drugs you're like well I want my 50,000 or I want my
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:53.600]  hundred thousand in some cases you know all the back pay you've been saving or
[3:13:53.600 --> 3:13:58.000]  whatever by the way we're in the military take every dime of it now and don't
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:01.200]  invest in any of their investment deals you're never gonna see it any of it
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:08.000]  okay you understand that and again this is not part of some military butt-kissing
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:11.360]  operation military knows when they're out there doing checkpoints and being
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:14.720]  part of it I'm in their face but it really makes me sick watching the
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:18.160]  military being abused like this while the very people doing it talk about how
[3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:21.280]  much they love the military that's their cover like liberals say they're
[3:14:21.280 --> 3:14:26.600]  liberals they're authoritarian eugenicists who created the Nazis these
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:31.000]  are people that are into how humans work and controlling us and gaming us
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:38.040]  they're con artists with a science plan and a propaganda core but none of their
[3:14:38.040 --> 3:14:43.520]  fancy garbage matters anymore when you know they're the enemy you understand
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:47.160]  that once you understand the score and their tricks they only run about 15
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:52.120]  different tricks you know the play I've seen the card man I know what you're up
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:56.760]  to now I'm turning the rest of this hour over to pharmacist Ben Fuchs who was
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:00.240]  with me as a guest but he's such a good talk show I was joining us via video
[3:15:00.240 --> 3:15:03.640]  Skype I'm gonna turn it over to him but first here's a report Jacari Jackson just
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:06.640]  did that was gonna air on the nightly news tonight but I thought why not just
[3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:10.760]  air this now because it gets into the veteran situation and kind of boils it
[3:15:10.760 --> 3:15:14.480]  all down some of the backstory because you know drudges linked to the article
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:21.400]  about about you know the current thing and which is great our info wars comm
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:25.040]  article that we you know discover what drudge was covering we then wrote an
[3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:29.000]  article just adding some of the history of this to it at info wars comm so go
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:32.160]  check out the drudge report comm link on the left-hand side then go and all the
[3:15:32.160 --> 3:15:35.680]  gun grabbing news then go check out our link with the backstory history on it
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:39.960]  but right now let's go ahead and go to this clip here it is with jacari
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:49.760]  Jackson
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:54.320]  I'm jacari Jackson for the info wars nightly news with all the pro military
[3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:58.360]  coverage in the media it also flies under the radar that veterans are viewed as
[3:15:58.360 --> 3:16:02.560]  the new terror threat we've seen the use of Timothy McVeigh and others used to
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:07.280]  demonize all veterans pushing the image of the angry disgruntled vet charging
[3:16:07.280 --> 3:16:10.720]  them with felonies and labeling them terrorists for doing things such as
[3:16:10.720 --> 3:16:14.360]  investigating surveillance cameras and demanding the rights that they fought to
[3:16:14.360 --> 3:16:18.400]  protect homeland security has lumped servicemen in with quote right wing
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:23.160]  extremist and using what can best be described as bunk science veterans are
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:26.880]  having their right to bear arms taken away even the Boy Scouts have run
[3:16:26.880 --> 3:16:31.760]  simulations on how to brutalize quote disgruntled veterans telling a veteran
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:35.320]  that they are too traumatized by the military experience to own a gun is like
[3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:38.680]  disarming a robbery victim because they are too traumatized by their home
[3:16:38.680 --> 3:16:42.280]  invasion now while I do agree that there are some veterans that may not be the
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:46.440]  most sound of mind and body you can say that of any in the American population
[3:16:46.440 --> 3:16:52.360]  regardless of occupation race sex location or any other of many factors and
[3:16:52.360 --> 3:16:56.600]  it's not always demonizing vets groups have worked behind the scenes to take
[3:16:56.600 --> 3:17:01.080]  away death benefits trample religious freedoms and even charge soldiers for
[3:17:01.080 --> 3:17:04.800]  the medals that they earned we've heard the anecdote that soldiers of old would
[3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:08.040]  roll over in their grays if they had to deal with this kind of treatment but the
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:11.360]  fact is that many veterans roll out of bed every day having to deal with these
[3:17:11.360 --> 3:17:17.720]  same issues I'm jacari Jackson for the info wars nightly news and every night
[3:17:17.720 --> 3:17:21.040]  you get at least 30 minutes of that sometimes two or three hours but we've
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:24.120]  got it cut down to an official 30 minutes for TV and that's enough to go
[3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:27.720]  into overdrive for the prison planet on TV members become a prison planet on TV

[3:18:04.480 --> 3:18:08.120]  most of you guys probably know who I am I've got a radio program called the
[3:18:08.120 --> 3:18:10.640]  bright side on the Genesis Communication Network airs eight to nine
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:15.480]  Pacific time 10 to 11 central time five days a week we talk about the glory and
[3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:20.960]  the greatness of the human body despite the fact that it seems like we are
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:24.720]  falling apart the Americans are the sickest culture in the history of the
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:28.400]  planet despite the fact that we have the highest health care costs and more
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:32.680]  doctors per capita than any other country in the world we're sicker than any
[3:18:32.680 --> 3:18:37.880]  other cut any other culture has ever been but despite that I have hope in the
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:42.040]  in the human body I'm a lover of the human body I've been studying the cells
[3:18:42.040 --> 3:18:46.080]  and studying tissues and studying the organs of the body since 1983 when I
[3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:49.680]  got into pharmacy school and if there's one thing that I've learned it is this
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:55.560]  the human body is a healing system it's a regenerating system it is designed
[3:18:55.560 --> 3:19:00.160]  divinely to heal and renew itself on a moment-to-moment basis and if we are not
[3:19:00.160 --> 3:19:05.520]  accessing this healing power we are doing something wrong and the fact of the
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:09.400]  matter is friends because of this built-in nature because of this built-in
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:15.160]  healing nature of the human body it is not difficult to access it it's not
[3:19:15.160 --> 3:19:19.840]  difficult to access what is already there we simply have to stop doing the
[3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:24.600]  things that cover this up most importantly we have to stop interacting
[3:19:24.600 --> 3:19:31.480]  with the corporate swill that passes for food McDonald's Taco Bell process food
[3:19:31.480 --> 3:19:36.640]  box foods these need to be avoided like the plague there is flat out no way we
[3:19:36.640 --> 3:19:41.920]  are going to be able to access our healing and health greatness as long as
[3:19:41.920 --> 3:19:45.960]  we are interacting with this corporate with this corporate food lifestyle

[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:53.200]  I'm especially interested in talking to you so please hang tight couple things I
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:58.680]  want to say first of all I've been in the skincare business since 1983 I'm a
[3:24:58.680 --> 3:25:01.360]  skincare formulator I formulated products for many years I've helped
[3:25:01.360 --> 3:25:06.440]  people with their skin for many years we spend hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:25:06.440 --> 3:25:09.840]  in skincare on this country in this country and let me tell you something
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:14.080]  people there's not a topical skincare product in the world that can do for your
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:17.640]  eczema they can do for your rosacea they can do for your psoriasis they can do
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:21.160]  for your skin what a good nutritional supplement program can do because the
[3:25:21.160 --> 3:25:25.160]  fact of the matter is if you are dealing with some kind of skin health issue that
[3:25:25.160 --> 3:25:29.480]  is compromising the way you look and the way you appear you are flat out dealing
[3:25:29.480 --> 3:25:33.800]  with some kind of nutritional deficiency and or digestive health issue in fact
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:38.600]  this relationship between the digestive system and the skin is extremely
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:43.880]  intimate when we're a fetus in the womb a tube is formed that becomes our
[3:25:43.880 --> 3:25:49.280]  digestive system over time and within days to weeks the cells of that tube
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:54.080]  flip over and become our skin and from that point forward the skin and the
[3:25:54.080 --> 3:25:59.000]  digestive system are like two peas in a pod they're best friends and anything
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:02.840]  that shows up on anything that any kind of break down on the digestive system is
[3:26:02.840 --> 3:26:06.440]  going to show up on the skin and anything that is showing up on the skin
[3:26:06.440 --> 3:26:11.480]  rest assured has some kind of root cause in the digestive system so if you guys
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:15.280]  are dealing with eczema acne psoriasis any kind of skincare health issue I
[3:26:15.280 --> 3:26:17.880]  want to hear from you when we can help guide you through the process of using
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:21.720]  the beyond tangy tangerine nutritional supplementation in general to take care
[3:26:21.720 --> 3:26:24.080]  of that and by the way if you're interested in purchasing any of the
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:28.920]  products that you hear us talk about info wars dot health for products or you
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:36.040]  could also call 1-888-789-9277 all right so if you're dealing with a skin
[3:26:36.040 --> 3:26:42.440]  carriage skin health issue if you've got rosacea vitiligo acne whatever it is you
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:47.720]  are dealing with the manifestation of a stress response that's secondary to a
[3:26:47.720 --> 3:26:51.520]  digestive system breakdown period end of story and if you go to a dermatologist
[3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:55.320]  and you go to a doctor and he gives you some kind of medicine guess what he's
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:26:59.080]  probably going to give you you're probably going to get a steroid cream why
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:02.800]  are you going to get a steroid cream what is the steroid cream a steroid cream
[3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:07.360]  is a cream that suppresses your immune system the immune system is your defense
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:13.440]  system the immune system is your stress management system the way dermatological
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:17.880]  treatments work the way skincare remedies work is they shut down the body
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:22.720]  stress response system and this is so important to understand because and I've
[3:27:22.720 --> 3:27:25.960]  said this before about the rest of the body but it's true about the skin as
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:31.520]  well our diseases are the manifestation of a long-term activation of the stress
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:36.920]  response system secondary to breakdown in the digestive system reading from one
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:40.840]  of my favorite magazine science news this came out I just got this I just got
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:45.760]  this yesterday I'm always looking for articles that verify some of these ideas
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:50.040]  about health and it's our lack of health and its relationship to the
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:56.400]  digestive system page 10 in science news digestive juices blamed in shock the
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:28:00.240]  nutrient absorbing structures I'm reading here quote the nutrient absorbing
[3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:06.520]  structures in intestines breakdown when an animal is in shock unquote period that
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:13.320]  is all you need to know about health and wellness we go into shock mode we go
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:17.680]  into safe mode we go into stress management mode when our digestive
[3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:22.360]  system breaks down and our digestive system breaks down my friends very early
[3:28:22.360 --> 3:28:26.920]  in life sometimes prenatally for most of us at least it break begins to break
[3:28:26.920 --> 3:28:32.040]  down when we leave the womb this is because when we leave the womb the human
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:37.600]  species the human being is born with a premature digestive tract we got big
[3:28:37.600 --> 3:28:41.080]  heads so we got to come out of the womb early we come out of the womb immature
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:45.480]  and especially at the digestive tract level but no problem nature takes care
[3:28:45.480 --> 3:28:49.320]  of everything this is where breast milk comes in breast milk is specifically
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:52.920]  designed to grow a digestive system by the way I'll tell you about here in a
[3:28:52.920 --> 3:28:56.040]  moment I'll tell you about a great nutritional supplement that you can use

[3:29:00.280 --> 3:29:05.040]  tract but for now I want to say that when we come out of the womb nature has
[3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:10.680]  designed a system where breast milk will grow our digestive tract if we are not
[3:29:10.680 --> 3:29:14.160]  breastfed long enough if we're not breastfed at all or if we're breastfed by
[3:29:14.160 --> 3:29:19.840]  moms who are themselves nutritionally compromised guess what we begin our life
[3:29:19.840 --> 3:29:23.520]  with strike one at the digestive tract level strike two begins when we
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:27.640]  interface when we interface with the standard American diet and by the time
[3:29:27.640 --> 3:29:32.040]  most of us are 10 or 12 years old our lymphatic system which is our poison and
[3:29:32.040 --> 3:29:36.200]  waste control system is so swollen we can't even breathe and we have to have
[3:29:36.200 --> 3:29:39.840]  a surgical procedure to have that lymph removed it's called a tonsillectomy we're

[3:33:31.200 --> 3:33:35.720]  are dealing with a skincare issue you can reverse it too sweet I'm talking
[3:33:35.720 --> 3:33:40.360]  eczema psoriasis acne the beautiful thing about the skin is it regenerates
[3:33:40.360 --> 3:33:45.120]  itself every four to eight weeks which means that whatever your skin condition
[3:33:45.120 --> 3:33:49.920]  is today you can begin the healing process immediately and within four to
[3:33:49.920 --> 3:33:52.960]  eight weeks you don't have to have it any longer but you do have to make some
[3:33:52.960 --> 3:33:56.960]  corrections most especially around digestive health and wellness and
[3:33:56.960 --> 3:33:59.760]  nutritional supplementation if you're interested by the way in purchasing any
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:01.960]  of the young Jebedee products that you've heard us talk about on this
[3:34:01.960 --> 3:34:10.720]  program go to info wars dot health or you can call 1-888-789-9277 all right so
[3:34:10.720 --> 3:34:13.920]  thanks get when you think skin think digestive health when you think
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:19.840]  digestive health think liquid nutrition the less work your digestive system has
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:25.160]  to do the better off it's going to be liquid nutrition allows you to bypass
[3:34:25.160 --> 3:34:31.120]  digestive juices to bypass the chewing up process the grinding process that
[3:34:31.120 --> 3:34:34.320]  occurs in the stomach and it allows your nutrients to go right to work and in
[3:34:34.320 --> 3:34:39.520]  fact this is why liquid nutrients like the beyond tangy tangerine works so
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:43.880]  effectively and work so fast but you don't need need just the beyond tangy
[3:34:43.880 --> 3:34:47.920]  tangerine you can use vegetable juices you can use soups in fact one of my
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:53.200]  favorite nutritional supplements for the skin is a bone soup where you take
[3:34:53.200 --> 3:34:57.840]  chicken carcass or even a whole chicken drop it in a pot of water put a little
[3:34:57.840 --> 3:35:01.680]  apple cider vinegar in there throw some veggies in there and let the soups let
[3:35:01.680 --> 3:35:05.560]  the water simmer until it forms a soupy consistency and the meat falls off the
[3:35:05.560 --> 3:35:10.040]  bone it makes the most delicious soup you've ever had you've ever tasted and
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:14.480]  on top of that the cartilaginous factors the cartilage factors that come out of
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:18.920]  the bone and dissolve into the water are some of the best and most protective
[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:22.760]  skin nutrients you could ever use and on top of all that it's great for your
[3:35:22.760 --> 3:35:25.760]  immune system it's great for your digestive system and it's great for
[3:35:25.760 --> 3:35:30.120]  your joints and it's called bone soup you can make it yourself it's cheap and
[3:35:30.120 --> 3:35:34.000]  tasty you can take the extra the stuff you don't use you can freeze it put it
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:39.120]  in a ice cube tray and make little ice cubes of bone soup ice cubes and then you
[3:35:39.120 --> 3:35:43.480]  can stick them in a in a saucepan and you can make fresh soup whenever you want
[3:35:43.480 --> 3:35:46.360]  or you can put in a microwave in a in a cup of water you can make yourself
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:50.360]  bone soup for lunch another great strategy for the digestive system is the
[3:35:50.360 --> 3:35:54.280]  young Jevvie product called Z radical Z radical is made up of something called
[3:35:54.280 --> 3:35:59.680]  polysaccharides or proteoglycans which are slimy kinds of material one of the
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:03.280]  ways that we get sick and one of the ways that we get into digestive health
[3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:07.920]  issues digestive health issues is by attack from substances that are
[3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:13.520]  produced by plants and bacteria called lectins that's spelled LEC TINS lectins
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:17.720]  are like sticky pods that attach themselves to our digestive tract and
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:21.560]  different parts of the body and can wreak havoc on not just digestive health
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:26.800]  but on urinary tract health on lung health on lectins are responsible for
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:30.800]  cancer lectins are responsible for gluten intolerance one of the neat
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:36.080]  things about the Z radical and its kind of slimy consistency is that slime
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:40.560]  coats these lectins and allows your body to excrete them and they can help improve
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:45.480]  the Z radical can help improve the symptoms of H pylori infection digestive
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:51.400]  distress arthritis and autoimmune diseases women for eons have used things
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:55.280]  like cranberry juice to help dissolve and wash away the bacteria that cause
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:36:59.480]  urinary tract infections and what what they were doing unknowingly is using the
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:04.280]  sugars and cranberry juice to slime away the bacteria the E. coli bacteria that
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:08.680]  cause the urinary tract infection so the Z radical for the digestive system the
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:12.280]  liquid nutrients especially the beyond tangentangerine for the digestive system
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:16.000]  and one more really cool nutritional supplement that you can use for the
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:19.560]  digestive system and for digestive health and also for building muscle and
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:22.360]  also for brain health and also for cardiovascular cardiovascular
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:25.240]  vascular health I'll tell you what that is here in a second but I want to get to
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:30.440]  the phones I take a couple phone calls before we do that dr. Mike I want to
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:33.760]  hear what you have to say dr. Mike and Wyoming what's going on buddy yes hi
[3:37:33.760 --> 3:37:40.240]  dr. few types I've listened to you a couple times on Alex's show and tried
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:46.680]  to call in I have I graduated from UTMB in Galveston and trained out at St.
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:52.000]  Joe's in Phoenix you you say a few things that really kind of discredits
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:56.880]  yourself although I think basically you're selling a good product and I use
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:00.560]  some of them but when you make statements like all diseases are
[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:06.200]  nutrition-based which you've made several times and statements to the effect
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:10.040]  that all physicians are just prostitutes in service to pharmaceutical
[3:38:10.040 --> 3:38:14.880]  industry well I've never I've never said that so I mean I'm interested in what
[3:38:14.880 --> 3:38:17.920]  Jeff said I've never said anything like that but but go ahead I want to hear
[3:38:17.920 --> 3:38:20.920]  Jeff say but don't don't be putting words in my mouth and don't be saying
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:23.960]  that implying that I said things that I didn't say but continue I want to hear
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:27.800]  what Jeff to say what's the title of your book I don't have a book I think
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:32.640]  you're mistaken me for somebody else no maybe maybe I am but thank you're
[3:38:32.640 --> 3:38:35.520]  mistaken oh you're talking about dead doctors don't lies that what you're
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:39.400]  talking about is that your book no it's not my book but I know what you're
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:44.000]  saying listen I don't want to get into a pissing contest here with you doc the
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:47.080]  fact of the matter is I don't not gonna tell you that all any I don't like
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:49.640]  saying the word all I never say the word all because there's always
[3:38:49.640 --> 3:38:55.160]  exceptions however I can tell you that in my experience behind almost almost all
[3:38:55.160 --> 3:39:00.080]  degenerative disease crisis is a problem processing nutrients either at the
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:04.400]  digestive system level or at the intake level do you agree disagree with that
[3:39:04.400 --> 3:39:11.480]  absolutely yeah well hang on hang on tell me what degenerative disease does
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:15.840]  not have at its core some kind of nutrition processing a nutrition
[3:39:15.840 --> 3:39:23.520]  processing issue or absorption issue or intake issue name one let me you cut
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:26.640]  me off but let me let me finish what I had to say you you you've also made a
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:31.120]  statement that that physicians have have virtually no training in I never said
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:34.920]  that you're you think you're confusing you somebody else I'm sorry but you
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:39.520]  did and you know I don't think you're in a position to even make statements like
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:42.680]  that I never said those things you're confusing you somebody else doc listen
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:44.680]  we're not we're not going anywhere thank you so much for your call
[3:39:44.680 --> 3:39:54.160]  I appreciate it a Julian California what's going on yes it is and I'm
[3:39:54.160 --> 3:39:59.600]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs sitting in for Alex is Alex Jones in there now or no Alex
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:02.160]  Jones maybe somewhere but can I help you we're talking about health and
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:06.120]  nutrition for the next 20 minutes or so okay well I was really going to talk to
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:08.980]  Alex Jones an hour since we're talking about health I want to get your take on
[3:40:08.980 --> 3:40:13.560]  anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications here's the deal anti-
[3:40:13.560 --> 3:40:18.880]  anxiety and anti-depressant medication are number one like all pharmaceutical
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:23.200]  medication their poisons number two depression and anxiety are not
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:27.400]  pharmaceutical issues there are the manifestation the psychological
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:33.160]  manifestation the brain manifestation of an activated stress response the body
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:37.240]  basically feels like it's dying now when the body feels like it's dying
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:41.720]  there's only two reasons that the body feels like it's dying number one because
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:44.960]  it thinks it's starving to death and number two it thinks is going to be
[3:40:44.960 --> 3:40:50.280]  eaten by a wild animal the human body doesn't understand 21st century stresses
[3:40:50.280 --> 3:40:54.720]  because the human body is an evolutionary mechanism that has been around for
[3:40:54.720 --> 3:40:58.880]  millions of years the IRS and our dysfunctional families and the police
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:03.600]  state and gluten intolerance these are all very recent phenomena to the human
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:08.480]  body so when we have a stress that is induced by something psychological like
[3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:12.120]  something that's going on in this in this society or a stress from prescription
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:16.720]  drugs or a stress from gluten to the body all it knows is that it's either
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:20.760]  about to die because it's going to be eaten by a tiger or it's about to die
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:26.200]  because it's starving to death so we call depression and we call anxiety or
[3:41:26.200 --> 3:41:30.640]  the psychological manifestations of a body in crisis a body that feels like
[3:41:30.640 --> 3:41:34.520]  it's about to die because it's about to be eaten or it's starving to death so
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:37.560]  what do you do how do you deal with these kinds of things well first of all
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:41.520]  the most important thing to deal with anxiety and depression is to somehow
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:47.400]  send the biochemistry the message that all is okay that your survival is not
[3:41:47.400 --> 3:41:50.320]  at stake and there's several ways to do that one of the simplest and one of the
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:54.720]  easiest is to practice deep breathing techniques deficiencies in oxygen will
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:41:59.160]  trigger this stress response that shows up as anxiety and depression faster than
[3:41:59.160 --> 3:42:02.920]  almost anything because our need for oxygen is such that three minutes without
[3:42:02.920 --> 3:42:07.720]  oxygen and we're dead so as soon as oxygen levels drop and carbon monox carbon
[3:42:07.720 --> 3:42:11.600]  dioxide levels go up our body will initiate the stress response which will
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:16.000]  show up physiologically as hypertension high blood pressure blood clotting a
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:21.600]  digestive distress immune suppression and will show up psychologically mentally
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:26.160]  as depression and anxiety anybody who gets panic attacks or anxiety attacks
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:34.240]  will tell you right before their anxiety attack they go into a deep hyperventilation
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:39.600]  fast breathing this hyperventilation and this fast breathing initiates the
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:43.360]  anxiety and initiates the panic attack if you're dealing with anxiety and panic
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:46.920]  attacks don't take my word for it right before you go into a panic attack you
[3:42:46.920 --> 3:42:50.840]  feel like one's coming on if you're dealing with anxiety practice deep
[3:42:50.840 --> 3:42:54.760]  breathing techniques number one what you'll end up doing is you'll open up
[3:42:54.760 --> 3:42:58.400]  your blood vessels number two you're going to thin your blood so you'll get
[3:42:58.400 --> 3:43:01.800]  more oxygen to tissues and you'll get more nutrients to tissues and number
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:06.840]  three you'll drop your brain wave states from the beta wave state which is a
[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:10.800]  fast-moving state that's involved in problem-solving and distress and you'll
[3:43:10.800 --> 3:43:16.000]  drop it into the hypnagogic states slowly so-called alpha state this is all
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:20.840]  done with something as simple as deep breathing you don't need a doctor for it
[3:43:20.840 --> 3:43:24.600]  you don't need a drug for it you don't need a to interface with the medical
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:28.080]  model at all for it you don't need insurance for it and it'll cost you
[3:43:28.080 --> 3:43:32.220]  zero the next second great strategy and we've been talking about this on the
[3:43:32.220 --> 3:43:35.760]  bright side for helping with depression or helping with anxiety or helping to
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:41.760]  tell the body that all is right in the world is to get yourself out in the sun
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:46.840]  to lay out in the sun without a sunscreen without a sunblock I'm not
[3:43:46.840 --> 3:43:50.640]  telling you to burn burning is never a good thing but if you don't if you're
[3:43:50.640 --> 3:43:54.720]  not going to burn in five or ten minutes get yourself out in the sun number one
[3:43:54.720 --> 3:44:00.320]  the sun stimulates anabolic chemistry that is building chemistry that chemistry
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:06.960]  of joy and happiness is also activated by the sun and on top of all of that when
[3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:11.840]  the sun hits your skin you produce a hormone called serotonin which many
[3:44:11.840 --> 3:44:16.680]  many of you guys have heard of which is converted into melatonin melatonin is a
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:20.960]  powerful relaxing substance and it's an anti-cancer substance and it's an
[3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:24.800]  anti-aging substance and it's wonderful for dealing with anxiety or or
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:28.680]  depression there are two very simple strategies breathing and getting out in
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:33.140]  the sun that can allow you to access the body's relaxation chemistry this
[3:44:33.140 --> 3:44:37.560]  anti-anxiety chemistry for free without having to go to the doctor and without
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:42.320]  having to deal with an insurance program now the third very effective way to deal
[3:44:42.320 --> 3:44:46.400]  with anxiety is to make sure that you're taking care of your nutritional needs and
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:50.680]  to make sure you're eating less calories now these are two very important
[3:44:50.680 --> 3:44:55.360]  strategies they kind of go hand-in-hand but remember this emergency response
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:44:59.960]  that the body has is number one to prevent us from being eaten by a tiger
[3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:05.400]  and number two to help us deal with starvation and famine nutritional
[3:45:05.400 --> 3:45:09.720]  deficiency tells the body that a famine is approaching when we don't get
[3:45:09.720 --> 3:45:13.720]  vitamin C when we don't get vitamin E when we don't get enough essential fatty
[3:45:13.720 --> 3:45:18.280]  acids when we don't get enough protein the body thinks it's dying the body
[3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:22.440]  thinks it's starving the body thinks a famine is approaching and this too will
[3:45:22.440 --> 3:45:26.600]  initiate and activate the stress response which will show up physiologically as
[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:30.360]  weight gain blood clotting hypertension and will show up mentally and
[3:45:30.360 --> 3:45:35.920]  psychologically as depression and anxiety so getting yourself on a
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:39.240]  nutritional supplement program especially one that has concentrated
[3:45:39.240 --> 3:45:43.480]  nutrients that allow your body to access the nutrients without having to
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:47.600]  deal with the digestive process can be a tremendous help for folks dealing with
[3:45:47.600 --> 3:45:51.840]  anxiety so important that you'll notice results really quickly especially in
[3:45:51.840 --> 3:45:55.720]  terms of the water soluble vitamins especially in terms of the B complex
[3:45:55.720 --> 3:46:00.200]  which are water soluble vitamins that are processed out of most foods B complex
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:04.000]  by the way are intimately connected with mental health a guy named Dr. Abram
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  Hoffer wrote a book called ortho molecular psychiatry many years ago we
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:12.720]  talked about using simple plain old niacin vitamin B3 to treat
[3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:17.040]  schizophrenia we treat it very effectively deficiencies in B vitamins
[3:46:17.040 --> 3:46:20.760]  are extremely common one of the main reasons is because we're getting so much
[3:46:20.760 --> 3:46:24.360]  processed food so your third strategy in addition to deep breathing techniques
[3:46:24.360 --> 3:46:28.400]  and making sure that you're getting a copious amounts of sunshine without a
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:32.400]  sunscreen and without burning your third strategy is to get yourself on a
[3:46:32.400 --> 3:46:36.680]  nutritional supplement program one that features the B complex and one that
[3:46:36.680 --> 3:46:40.760]  features liquid nutrition I hope I helped you there Julie any other questions
[3:46:40.760 --> 3:46:49.800]  for me all right one a couple people on hold that I want to get to but before we
[3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:52.600]  do that I want to tell you about a wonderful nutritional supplement that's
[3:46:52.600 --> 3:46:56.000]  super for the digestive system and one we don't really talk about is being
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:59.880]  important for digestive health and that's whey protein whey protein is
[3:46:59.880 --> 3:47:03.880]  obviously an important building protein it's a component of milk it contains
[3:47:03.880 --> 3:47:11.200]  fractions from the milk that are designed to build the baby's digestive tract remember
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:15.680]  the baby is born human babies and mammal babies in general are born with
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:20.920]  premature digestive tract and nature has a system designed to build the
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:26.000]  digestive tract via breast milk well the component in breast milk that has the
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:30.280]  most building properties for the digestive tract is the whey fraction and
[3:47:30.280 --> 3:47:35.640]  especially the whey protein fraction so whey protein is not only a bodybuilder's
[3:47:35.640 --> 3:47:40.360]  favorite food favorite supplement super source of building amino acids but it's
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:45.560]  also critical for digestive health and digestive wellness now not only is it
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:48.160]  important for helping build the digestive tract but there's also
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:54.200]  substances in whey protein that protect the digestive tract especially against
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:47:57.880]  those lectins that we talked about in the last in the last segment lectins are
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:01.720]  the sticky components on bacteria and sticky components that are found in
[3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:05.800]  vegetables that can stick or adhere themselves to the digestive tract whey
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:10.120]  protein has anti-lectin substances that can protect you from these up these
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:13.040]  come these lectin components and vegetables and they can be especially
[3:48:13.040 --> 3:48:17.080]  whey protein can be especially effective if you're dealing with gluten
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:22.240]  intolerance the gluten reaction is a lectin reaction it's a sticky
[3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:25.680]  attachment to the intestine there are ingredients and whey protein that can
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:29.280]  help dissolve that lectin attachment not say a hundred percent of the time it's
[3:48:29.280 --> 3:48:32.480]  going to work but for a lot of folks getting on a whey protein supplement
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:35.680]  can be a wonderful way to deal with gluten intolerance issues as well as
[3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:39.440]  any other lectin issues and the neat thing about whey protein and one of my
[3:48:39.440 --> 3:48:43.080]  favorite things about nutritional supplementation is unlike prescription
[3:48:43.080 --> 3:48:47.400]  drugs that perhaps give you a little bit of purported benefit and a lot of
[3:48:47.400 --> 3:48:51.400]  side effects nutritional supplements give you benefits and instead of side
[3:48:51.400 --> 3:48:55.120]  effects they give you side benefits so if you take your whey protein for your
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:58.360]  digestive system you're going to find that you're building better muscle that
[3:48:58.360 --> 3:49:01.760]  you're eating less food that you got a better immune system and you're
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:06.360]  supporting circulatory system as well circulatory system health as well as
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:09.040]  one of the coolest things about getting yourself on a nutritional supplement
[3:49:09.040 --> 3:49:14.240]  program is you get multiple benefits multiple health benefits rather than
[3:49:14.240 --> 3:49:18.600]  side effects all right if you want to purchase any of the ungevity products go

[3:54:08.000 --> 3:54:12.520]  farmers has been sitting in for the next few minutes for Alex Jones let's see
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:16.800]  fast food linked to asthma risk also from science news I love this magazine
[3:54:16.800 --> 3:54:21.200]  fast food linked to asthma risk surprise surprise a diet high in fast food
[3:54:21.200 --> 3:54:25.240]  seems to increase the risk of asthma this is the deal friends asthma is
[3:54:25.240 --> 3:54:31.120]  another manifestation of the stress response run amok and fast food tells
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:36.320]  the body an emergency has occurred inside inside an emergency is occurring
[3:54:36.320 --> 3:54:40.640]  inside the body and by the way when we eat any food we activate something called
[3:54:40.640 --> 3:54:45.920]  the post-prandial immune system post-prandial means post eating that
[3:54:45.920 --> 3:54:51.120]  means any food that means a good food if we just a salad we will activate
[3:54:51.120 --> 3:54:56.800]  our body's immune system let alone if we start to ingest fast food toxic food
[3:54:56.800 --> 3:55:01.480]  processed food food that's filled with excitotoxins and preservatives this
[3:55:01.480 --> 3:55:07.520]  idea of watching what you eat is so fundamentally important and also eating
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:12.320]  less food practicing something called intermittent fasting every single
[3:55:12.320 --> 3:55:18.480]  study that's been done on longevity has shown that reducing your calories
[3:55:18.480 --> 3:55:22.920]  increases your longevity caloric restriction with adequate nutrition is
[3:55:22.920 --> 3:55:26.520]  the most powerful longevity inducing strategy lifestyle strategy you could
[3:55:26.520 --> 3:55:31.920]  ever use all right real quick Ryan in Colorado cold your friend doesn't have
[3:55:31.920 --> 3:55:35.400]  a colon and you're I'm assuming large intestine and you're wondering about
[3:55:35.400 --> 3:55:39.560]  whey protein correct yeah well you're just talking about whey protein I was
[3:55:39.560 --> 3:55:43.080]  thinking about that that was exactly why I called in but if you could just touch
[3:55:43.080 --> 3:55:46.280]  on that real quick well you're not gonna have to worry about it too much of
[3:55:46.280 --> 3:55:49.320]  without a large intestine whey protein the amino acids and whey protein are
[3:55:49.320 --> 3:55:53.880]  absorbed very effectively I might add in the small intestine so she should be
[3:55:53.880 --> 3:55:58.040]  okay in that regard the most important thing to recognize about whey protein in
[3:55:58.040 --> 3:56:04.640]  my opinion is it is a tremendously usable source of protein and non protein
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:10.320]  factors that help our immune system and help the body grow so that not only are
[3:56:10.320 --> 3:56:13.480]  you getting amino acids not only you're getting the building substances but
[3:56:13.480 --> 3:56:17.680]  you're also getting substances like lactoferrin and and the lacked albumin
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:21.400]  and immune boosting factors that are designed to support the immune system
[3:56:21.400 --> 3:56:25.040]  and prevent you from getting cancer and degenerative disease that's one of the
[3:56:25.040 --> 3:56:29.480]  neatest things about whey protein and it's one of the important distinguishing
[3:56:29.480 --> 3:56:33.720]  features of whey protein that you don't get in other sources of protein as good
[3:56:33.720 --> 3:56:37.120]  as they may be hemp seed protein for example is a wonderful way to get your
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:41.160]  protein but it doesn't have these building factors like the lactoferrin
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:45.240]  and the albumins that are found in whey protein all right well we got a couple of
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:50.280]  a couple of minutes Tim and Georgia what's going on buddy

[3:57:10.720 --> 3:57:15.320]  to what you're talking about here I was diagnosed with chronic panic disorder
[3:57:15.320 --> 3:57:20.320]  from the Navy and it turns out I was also diagnosed at the same time with
[3:57:20.320 --> 3:57:25.960]  infasema okay like it's kind of like a breathing deal with it feeds off one
[3:57:25.960 --> 3:57:30.600]  another and what was the first thing you said Tim I didn't hear what the first
[3:57:30.600 --> 3:57:35.000]  thing you said chronic pain disorder chronic panic disorder oh chronic that
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:38.440]  yes they do they go together this is exactly what I'm telling you when the
[3:57:38.440 --> 3:57:44.440]  body is deprived of oxygen it thinks it's about to die so COPD and emphysema
[3:57:44.440 --> 3:57:49.120]  and breathing problems will initiate panic attacks and anxiety attacks faster
[3:57:49.120 --> 3:57:54.520]  than almost anything else so the two go together number one force yourself if you
