[00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:06.617]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.617 --> 00:00:08.399]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.160]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.721]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:12.622]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:17.486]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:21.550]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:35.836]  Well, I didn't get home until about 12.30 last night, and then I got up at 5 a.m.
[00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:39.497]  to take Jesse Ventura to the airport at 6 a.m.
[00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.677]  for his 7 a.m.
[00:00:40.677 --> 00:00:41.937]  flight.
[00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:45.858]  I just talked to Ted Anderson, who owns Genesis, who was on the same flight back.
[00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:47.399]  They just got back to Minneapolis.
[00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.279]  They were on the same flight on Northwest.
[00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:51.320]  Why is that important?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.061]  Because Ventura said, listen, you gotta have this guy on.
[00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:56.541]  It's a close race for the Senate.
[00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:01.444]  And, uh, you know, he's the only anti-establishment candidate.
[00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:15.507]  It's the guy that, uh, Ventura appointed to the Senate for, like, a month whenever Senator Wellstone died mysteriously in that plane crash.
[00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:26.450]  And, uh, he, of course, was part of the, um, Liberty Rally with Ron Paul, so he's a, uh, he's a Ron Paul supporter and very closely aligned with Ron Paul.
[00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:39.207]  I don't know what time they're coming on today because Ventura's got to get home first, but I think it's around noon or 1230 and it's Ventura's idea to do this, so it will probably happen.
[00:01:39.207 --> 00:01:40.908]  But we won't just be talking about that.
[00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:43.228]  We spent four hours at Willie Nelson's house.
[00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:48.397]  That was an amazing story in and of itself.
[00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:59.702]  We've got close to four hours of interviews with Willie Nelson and I've seen a lot of media and other people out at his place before and never seen him give people tours of his home.
[00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:08.007]  We hung out in his bedroom slash den for about an hour and we talked about everything.
[00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:12.069]  We've got Jesse and Willie on video talking about the New World Order.
[00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:16.234]  Talking about everything under the sun for almost four hours.
[00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:20.475]  We're out there four hours, but I think total it's about three and a half hours of footage.
[00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:23.316]  And I got two guys out here just trying to log the tapes.
[00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:25.097]  Just trying to watch the tapes.
[00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:26.137]  They got in at 9 a.m.
[00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:26.598]  this morning.
[00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:27.698]  They're out there doing a great job.
[00:02:27.698 --> 00:02:35.961]  Jason Burmiss is down here for the week to visit with us and work on some things.
[00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:38.562]  And also the real reason is to get his braces.
[00:02:38.562 --> 00:02:41.583]  Every few months he's got to come out and visit my dad to get his braces worked on.
[00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:48.068]  Uh, but, um, just absolutely amazing.
[00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:57.976]  Because it was an intense four hours out at Willie's place, on the bus, at his little town of Luck, his little town where he shoots movies, with all these old, real western houses they brought in.
[00:02:57.976 --> 00:03:02.520]  Then at his house, and seeing his wild horses, he's got 70-something of them.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.703]  And then, they were running late at the event, with all the other bands.
[00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:10.887]  Willie didn't even get there till after Jimmy Vaughn basically had gone off.
[00:03:11.813 --> 00:03:14.795]  And, uh, we did some live stuff, some live feeds.
[00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:16.335]  Some of them went out, some didn't.
[00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:18.637]  But we didn't... Again, I explain this to people.
[00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:26.841]  We were tagged on because Willie had the idea from a caller on the show to have a whole 9-11 slash event anti-war.
[00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:29.422]  And then he said, no, just come to my event and speak.
[00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.763]  And then it just all was crazy and wild.
[00:03:31.763 --> 00:03:34.485]  And that thing was overflowing with people.
[00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:36.766]  And, uh, Ventura was just having such a great time.
[00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:37.886]  He just said, ah, whatever.
[00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:40.327]  Let's just go do some live feeds over here.
[00:03:40.327 --> 00:03:41.268]  Because they were going to wait.
[00:03:42.362 --> 00:03:48.123]  And I guess then Willie wouldn't have left until after 12.30 or so, just for us to do that in Ventura.
[00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:59.685]  Let me tell you something, hanging out in Ventura for two days, I've been around a lot of quote celebrities and people and they're all interesting folks, but Ventura is a wild man.
[00:03:59.685 --> 00:04:02.186]  I mean, this guy, you think I have energy?
[00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:08.107]  This guy, this guy is just amazing and so interesting.
[00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.281]  And, uh, we shot, like, two hours driving around the car with him.
[00:04:13.281 --> 00:04:16.563]  So we've got almost four hours with Willie and Ventura.
[00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:22.387]  And we've probably got two hours... Wouldn't you say, guys, two hours in the car with Ventura?
[00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.287]  Total?
[00:04:23.287 --> 00:04:29.091]  No, and driving around, I mean, it is just, uh, really interesting footage.
[00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:30.392]  Really powerful, and that...
[00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:34.822]  Is the big event because we're going to put that all out on the web for everybody.
[00:04:34.822 --> 00:04:42.966]  Put it in high quality for folks on PrisonPlanet.tv and it'll immediately, as we request, be ripped to YouTube and Google and the rest of it.
[00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:47.007]  But, uh, the guys are working to get some selects.
[00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:50.609]  20 minutes or so up to date just on YouTube for everybody.
[00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:53.950]  And, uh, then in the next coming days it'll all be up there.
[00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.531]  Okay, the news is really serious.
[00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:57.531]  Let me immediately get into that.
[00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:58.992]  On the other side of this quick break, stay with me.

[00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:10.103]  Longtime survivalist author Ragnar Benson wrote, a survival retreat is a place you go to live, not die.
[00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:15.589]  It is a place out of the mainstream of events that contains the means to survive without outside support.
[00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:22.537]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine, and warmth you prepared for yourself.
[00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:22.637]  It is
[00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:22.817]  I'm good.
[00:05:44.128 --> 00:05:47.809]  Something completely impossible for the average American to do.
[00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:49.770]  Act now before it's too late.

[00:06:01.214 --> 00:06:08.176]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.241]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:16.589]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:26.169]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:33.253]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:33.253 --> 00:06:36.334]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:41.497]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:59.174]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:09.807]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:07:09.807 --> 00:07:17.971]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:20.633]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1%
[00:07:21.493 --> 00:07:22.193]  We're good to go!

[00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.831]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.903 --> 00:08:21.825]  Coming up, later in the shower, I'm gonna air a 10-minute compilation from YouTube.
[00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:31.667]  The New World Order for Complete Idiots, where it just goes through clip after clip after clip after clip of world leaders calling for world government a new world order.
[00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:34.228]  Got some really bad news this morning.
[00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:44.351]  Celica Stillo, the army sniper in Vietnam, the sheriff's deputy, the DEA agent,
[00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:49.853]  Who exposed government narcotics trafficking out of Alopongo.
[00:08:49.853 --> 00:08:56.679]  Down in the different areas of Central and South America, but Alopongo mainly.
[00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:59.461]  They set him up on gun charges.
[00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.823]  Because, you know, he'll go to a few gun shows.
[00:09:01.823 --> 00:09:03.164]  He's a school teacher.
[00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:04.605]  Not now.
[00:09:04.605 --> 00:09:08.648]  And, you know, I've been to the gun show and I've seen him there.
[00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:12.772]  And he'll just sell a few of his books, Powder Burns, and while he's sitting there,
[00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:17.044]  You know, buy, sell, and trade a few guns.
[00:09:17.044 --> 00:09:19.906]  Literally, maybe one or two a month.
[00:09:19.906 --> 00:09:22.367]  That's your so-called Second Amendment.
[00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:28.191]  And they sent in a guy to sell him guns just to sting him, just to set him up.
[00:09:28.191 --> 00:09:31.434]  And he just got sentenced to three years in prison.
[00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:36.337]  Got his email, came in over the weekend.
[00:09:36.337 --> 00:09:41.560]  We had asked him to come on a few months ago to give us updates, but he said he wanted to stay quiet about it until he saw what happened.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.722]  The listeners of this show are unbelievable.
[00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.372]  You are unbelievably wonderful.
[00:09:46.372 --> 00:09:48.872]  You raised $12,000 for him in one interview here.
[00:09:48.872 --> 00:09:56.155]  And that gave him some defense.
[00:09:56.155 --> 00:10:03.297]  And he's a school teacher in South Texas with children.
[00:10:03.297 --> 00:10:08.799]  And you see this over and over and over again with people that blow the whistle.
[00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:11.020]  How they're burned, how they're attacked, how they're set up.
[00:10:13.098 --> 00:10:16.360]  And it's just terrible to have seen this happen.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.224]  So he's scheduled to be on with us coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:10:22.224 --> 00:10:33.572]  I'm so exhausted from only getting about three hours, three and a half hours sleep last night that I was going to have Jason Burmiss sit in for the last two hours today.
[00:10:33.572 --> 00:10:37.394]  But he definitely, while he's here this week, he wants to sit in.
[00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:39.896]  I'm going to have him sit in probably for a whole show or more.
[00:10:41.318 --> 00:10:43.099]  He'll definitely be riding shotgun with us today.
[00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:46.560]  I just got this silly message this morning, and I think I need to interview him.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.301]  Because I know the case better.
[00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:50.962]  But, uh... I don't know.
[00:10:50.962 --> 00:10:51.923]  Let me call him in here.
[00:10:51.923 --> 00:10:54.123]  Hey, Burmas!
[00:10:54.123 --> 00:10:55.624]  He's out there talking to somebody.
[00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:59.926]  Hey, guys, we call Burmas in here.
[00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.246]  Hey, bro, come on in here for a minute.
[00:11:01.246 --> 00:11:02.287]  Let me just ask you a question.
[00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.287]  Sure thing.
[00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:05.468]  Are you familiar with the Celica Stillo case?
[00:11:05.468 --> 00:11:07.209]  Yes, uh, Powder Burns is his book, yes.
[00:11:08.058 --> 00:11:11.180]  Well, he got convicted, I guess, last Friday.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.222]  He emailed us over the weekend.
[00:11:14.222 --> 00:11:21.287]  I know I had you sitting in the last two hours today, but... How many days are you here?
[00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:22.728]  You leave Thursday or Friday?
[00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:26.010]  I leave Thursday morning, so I'll only be here until Wednesday afternoon.
[00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.132]  I think I leave at like 6 or 7 in the morning.
[00:11:29.132 --> 00:11:29.873]  Thursday?
[00:11:29.873 --> 00:11:30.013]  Yeah.
[00:11:32.486 --> 00:11:33.967]  So good to be here, Alex, by the way.
[00:11:33.967 --> 00:11:37.749]  Hey Burbis, just real fast, I want to have you know later about this.
[00:11:37.749 --> 00:11:40.110]  What was it like, four hours at Willie's house, getting the grand?
[00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.270]  It was just awesome, man.
[00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:46.413]  I mean, it's just like, such a humble guy, such an awesome piece of property.
[00:11:46.413 --> 00:11:48.253]  He lives very modestly.
[00:11:48.253 --> 00:11:48.894]  Up on a mountain.
[00:11:48.894 --> 00:11:59.359]  Yeah, and do you know, it just, you know, I'm not saying New York guy, I'm a country guy, and just to see the guy, you know, he doesn't live in a big lavish mansion or whatever, and the room he really likes to hang out with, it is what, like maybe 20 by 40?
[00:12:00.499 --> 00:12:01.760]  You know, that last room he showed us.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.842]  So, it was really cool to be with somebody that younger.
[00:12:03.842 --> 00:12:06.263]  It was his bedroom, there at the little table with the checkers.
[00:12:06.263 --> 00:12:06.824]  No, not that one.
[00:12:06.824 --> 00:12:09.205]  I'm talking about the little den that he took us to later in the day.
[00:12:09.205 --> 00:12:09.926]  Oh, the little side house.
[00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:10.827]  Yeah, the little side house.
[00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:12.027]  It's like, ah, I like to hang out here.
[00:12:12.027 --> 00:12:14.389]  And then the bus is so narrow, and he likes to hang out there.
[00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:17.251]  It just was so cool, and you can see his generosity.
[00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:19.093]  There were a lot of horses out there that he'd rescue.
[00:12:19.093 --> 00:12:22.375]  You could tell they weren't like... That's 70-something rescued Mustangs.
[00:12:22.415 --> 00:12:26.098]  Yeah, yeah, and you could tell that they were rescued horses, that they would have been slaughtered otherwise.
[00:12:26.098 --> 00:12:29.060]  So, you know, he had a great heart and just to hang out with Jesse Ventura, too, man.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:29.700]  I mean, you were there.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.141]  It was great.
[00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:32.102]  The two of them together, it was crazy.
[00:12:32.102 --> 00:12:36.805]  Oh, it was him and, you know, prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv is going to be putting that stuff up.
[00:12:36.805 --> 00:12:37.286]  It's awesome.
[00:12:37.286 --> 00:12:38.967]  I mean, I'd want to be a member.
[00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:39.647]  I wasn't ever.
[00:12:39.647 --> 00:12:42.449]  I mean, this is stuff that if I wasn't there, I'd want to see.
[00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:45.512]  Well, regardless, everybody's going to get to see it.
[00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:48.634]  The members just get it in high quality and I always feel like I'm kind of
[00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:56.513]  Hurting them, not just having it exclusively for them, but I'm happy that folks grab and put it all over the web, because that's our main mission, as long as we can pay the bills, we're happy.
[00:12:56.513 --> 00:13:05.597]  But anyways, we also sent out Jimmy Vaughn's transmission and some live reports from Jesse Ventura and some others.
[00:13:05.597 --> 00:13:08.279]  Now, I'm not sure how many people even saw those.
[00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:14.402]  There were people commenting saying, we didn't see you in Ventura, or we didn't see you guys speaking, and we did a bunch of live reports there, so I'm
[00:13:15.413 --> 00:13:17.817]  But that's all saved on a DVD.
[00:13:17.817 --> 00:13:21.202]  So the thing about live on the web, well we recorded it there.
[00:13:21.202 --> 00:13:28.633]  So regardless, we need to call David because he was out there videoing that with the web stuff.
[00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:30.156]  We need to get that DVD because that
[00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:37.879]  I mean, that way we can just take that and put that on the web and it's so much quicker than having to dump our tapes and go through all that.
[00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:44.002]  Very exciting, you know, you're in a crowd of 5,000 people, Jesse Ventura is there, you were there, the lights are on, we're talking about peace.
[00:13:44.002 --> 00:13:45.303]  I mean, it was awesome, Alex.
[00:13:45.303 --> 00:13:48.104]  It was just so cool to be back there and talk to Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:13:48.104 --> 00:13:49.125]  He was very nice to me.
[00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:50.945]  I mean, just a dream come true day.
[00:13:50.945 --> 00:13:52.806]  I mean, a life experience like no other.
[00:13:52.806 --> 00:13:55.868]  I couldn't trade this in for any vacation in the world, Alex.
[00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:56.488]  Absolutely.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.202]  Again, I'm operating on about three hours sleeper.
[00:14:02.202 --> 00:14:12.809]  Because, well, we left about midnight, and then I went and dropped Inter off at the hotel at the Driscoll, and then we came over to the office and talked about 30 minutes, and I went home.
[00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:15.571]  I got home about 1.15, and then, man, 4.45.
[00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:19.534]  No, no, 4.55.
[00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:24.437]  I slept in the guest bedroom, so I wouldn't wake my wife up, and I don't even know why I'm talking about that right now.
[00:14:24.437 --> 00:14:25.959]  I'm in zombie mode.
[00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:26.379]  But you know what?
[00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:27.840]  A huge weight is off me because
[00:14:28.832 --> 00:14:34.297]  This whole thing was, you know, first it was, you know, Willie O'Hare is like, yeah, I set the venue, you have a huge event.
[00:14:34.297 --> 00:14:36.459]  He goes, well, I'm real busy, just come to this event.
[00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:43.025]  I'm like, you want me to go to the last backyard and have us, you know, be inserted into this and do this with people that are already there.
[00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:46.268]  The thing was basically already sold out, but then it went pretty well.
[00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:48.330]  So it's done and I'm happy.
[00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:54.095]  But, but the, the, the event is going to be these interviews because folks, you know, I don't hype up interviews unless they're really big.
[00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.128]  Amazing stuff.
[00:14:56.128 --> 00:15:00.091]  I mean, amazing, amazing video.
[00:15:00.091 --> 00:15:01.932]  And there were some times we switched the cameras off.
[00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:03.573]  That was even more amazing.
[00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:09.017]  But it was, it was definitely, I mean, something else.
[00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:09.637]  Absolutely.
[00:15:09.637 --> 00:15:19.303]  And you know, just to get an insight, someone who's lived life like Jesse Ventura, I mean, we talked about not only his wrestling career, acting career and governor career, but his music career as well.
[00:15:19.303 --> 00:15:21.225]  And his dealing with Virgin Records.
[00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:22.245]  I mean, it was just so cool.
[00:15:22.245 --> 00:15:23.927]  It was the bodyguard of the Rolling Stones.
[00:15:23.927 --> 00:15:24.207]  Yeah.
[00:15:24.827 --> 00:15:27.510]  Yeah, I mean it was just craziness.
[00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:33.315]  He was telling all these military stories and then telling stories about catching poachers on his little lake.
[00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:35.077]  Yeah, can you imagine Jesse Ventura?
[00:15:35.077 --> 00:15:38.060]  Pulling up with a machine gun.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:44.586]  Yeah, I mean just like you're out there, you're fishing on illegal property and you think you're going to get away with it and all of a sudden this six foot five monster
[00:15:45.186 --> 00:15:45.807]  I think so.
[00:16:05.906 --> 00:16:08.128]  But now he hit placement, did well.
[00:16:08.128 --> 00:16:10.490]  You know, you're not supposed to run for a long time to make it really set right.
[00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.031]  Now it's good.
[00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:13.253]  Now he's about to get back into running and everything.
[00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:14.033]  So that's really great.
[00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:15.975]  I mean, he's just an amazing guy.
[00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.918]  And, well, wait until you see the video, folks.
[00:16:19.725 --> 00:16:24.349]  I mean, you know, us in there arguing about the New World Order, all having heated discussions.
[00:16:24.349 --> 00:16:27.011]  I mean, Willie Nelson, Alex Jones, and Jesse Ventura.
[00:16:27.011 --> 00:16:28.072]  It's quite a mix.
[00:16:28.072 --> 00:16:29.033]  It is quite a mix.
[00:16:29.033 --> 00:16:33.357]  And, you know, just to get Willie Nelson on the record about these global issues is great.
[00:16:33.357 --> 00:16:34.678]  You know, he seemed really informed.
[00:16:34.678 --> 00:16:36.439]  He had the little XM radio going on.
[00:16:36.439 --> 00:16:39.122]  He's like, I listen to Air America, and we're like, yeah, Air America's good.
[00:16:39.122 --> 00:16:43.345]  But, you know, some of the guys he listens to you've had on the show, Alex, people like Mike Malloy, who have brought 9-11 Truth out.
[00:16:44.466 --> 00:16:47.568]  Well, he's very aware of that, and that was very nice to see.
[00:16:47.568 --> 00:16:53.792]  And, you know, Jesse was rocking a shirt yesterday that said Obama, McCain, and anyone else, and he had anyone else checked off.
[00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:58.175]  And a lot of people were making comments while I was, you know, taping you guys, and they saw that shirt.
[00:16:58.175 --> 00:16:59.256]  They're like, anyone else?
[00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:00.517]  I'm a McCain supporter.
[00:17:00.517 --> 00:17:01.978]  I'm an Obama supporter.
[00:17:01.978 --> 00:17:04.119]  And it's nice to see that now he is around that.
[00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:09.123]  Because when you first interviewed him, he's like, watch out, Barack Obama, for an assassination.
[00:17:09.123 --> 00:17:14.246]  But it seems he's kind of gotten beyond that and sees, you know... Well, since then, Obama has said he's for the wiretapping.
[00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:19.249]  Yeah, but I mean, he's hoodwinked a lot of people, Obama, and it's nice to see that he has not hoodwinked Jesse Ventura.
[00:17:19.249 --> 00:17:21.090]  He's left the run for a presidential run open.
[00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:34.717]  In the next four years.
[00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:35.978]  I hope that he runs, folks.
[00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:39.560]  I mean, this guy, I really believe this is the guy that can help save the Republic.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.200]  He's the everyman.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.461]  He may not be right about everything.
[00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:52.768]  I mean, knowing this, actually, you know, because I've been around him a few other times and interviewed him a lot, but being in person with him for two days, driving around, eating with him, hanging out, you guys hanging out with us, at the Driscoll and everywhere else, I mean, he is the real deal.
[00:17:52.768 --> 00:17:52.908]  Yeah.
[00:17:52.908 --> 00:17:54.089]  I mean, he's just a real person.
[00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:58.292]  And you can tell when he gets hyped up because he starts moving around.
[00:17:58.292 --> 00:18:02.575]  I mean, you know, we were having that discussion before and like first half of the day he wasn't moving around a lot.
[00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:06.617]  But when he gets really emotional, you can tell he's very, very... Well, let's just boil it down.
[00:18:06.617 --> 00:18:10.740]  I got to get an interview in the car because you guys were arguing so much back and forth.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:16.264]  So you got Jesse hanging over the seat in the front with me driving through traffic screaming at you guys.
[00:18:16.264 --> 00:18:17.765]  We were talking North American Union.
[00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:19.226]  It got a little heated, you know.
[00:18:19.226 --> 00:18:22.168]  You know, Jesse's an ardent supporter of no borders and
[00:18:23.047 --> 00:18:29.272]  You know, he wants sovereignty, but, you know, in his words, hey, what's wrong with these brown people?
[00:18:29.272 --> 00:18:40.661]  And our whole point is, the globalists, openly in their own documents, and we were sourcing them, say that they want to drive down the wages, break down the cohesion, not just of the U.S., but other nations.
[00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:44.362]  And that national sovereignty is their enemy.
[00:18:44.362 --> 00:18:50.324]  And then also, I'm like, Jesse, I understand you're a nice guy, and you're friendly, and you don't care about what's happening in Mexico.
[00:18:50.324 --> 00:18:53.105]  The point is, their government's taught them this belongs to Mexico.
[00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:54.025]  Gringos are bad.
[00:18:54.025 --> 00:18:56.746]  And, uh, you know, we've educated him a lot.
[00:18:56.746 --> 00:18:59.486]  We're gonna bring him the rest of the way along on that, I guarantee you.
[00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:01.467]  I mean, look how much we've already deprogrammed Jesse Ventura.
[00:19:01.567 --> 00:19:02.147]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:19:02.147 --> 00:19:05.608]  And you know, once he realizes it's more about a consolidation of power.
[00:19:05.608 --> 00:19:09.949]  It's about a North American Union, a European Union, a Pan-American Union, a Eurasian Union.
[00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:12.069]  So they can consolidate into this one world government.
[00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:13.630]  I think he's going to see the bigger picture.
[00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:21.211]  And you did mention to him, and you'll see this on the web soon, Tragedy and Hope, Carol Quigley, the Roundtable Group, Rhodes Scholars.
[00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:23.572]  I think we've got to get him a little acquainted with G. Edward Griffin's work.
[00:19:23.652 --> 00:19:24.973]  You know, maybe that would be good for him.
[00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:30.459]  I think, give him the Creature from Jekyll Island and let him watch the New World Order speech that, uh, he gives that lecture.
[00:19:30.459 --> 00:19:36.826]  I think that would be really good for Jesse to understand that even though that sounds good on the feature, I mean, I'm all for personal freedom across the world.
[00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:40.370]  If tomorrow I could change the world and everybody was free, I'd be all for it.
[00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.192]  But that's not the reality of the situation.
[00:19:42.192 --> 00:19:44.455]  They're going to try to bring this global government in.
[00:19:45.216 --> 00:19:47.360]  Through us consenting to it.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.861]  Exactly.
[00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:49.725]  Hey, Jason Burmiss, thanks for coming in.
[00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:52.672]  I'm going to hit all the hard news when we get back.
[00:19:52.672 --> 00:19:54.396]  It's good having Burmy back in Austin.
[00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:02.441]  I am so frustrated.
[00:20:02.441 --> 00:20:04.782]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:20:04.782 --> 00:20:05.362]  What?
[00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:08.122]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:20:08.122 --> 00:20:09.542]  I read something and forget.
[00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.803]  I forget people's names.
[00:20:10.803 --> 00:20:14.603]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:20:14.603 --> 00:20:16.344]  I... Okay, slow down.
[00:20:16.344 --> 00:20:18.904]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:20:18.904 --> 00:20:26.065]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:20:26.065 --> 00:20:27.666]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:20:27.666 --> 00:20:29.426]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[00:20:29.426 --> 00:20:30.326]  Even entire books.
[00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:30.866]  What?
[00:20:30.866 --> 00:20:31.427]  How?
[00:20:31.427 --> 00:20:34.689]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:20:34.689 --> 00:20:38.453]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:20:38.453 --> 00:20:48.100]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.485]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:54.005]  Wow.
[00:20:54.005 --> 00:20:54.766]  What's the website?
[00:20:55.026 --> 00:20:58.487]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[00:20:58.487 --> 00:21:01.288]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:03.409]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.749]  October 27, 2008.
[00:21:03.749 --> 00:21:05.270]  Gold opened this morning at 714.80.
[00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.971]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for 737.26, 368.63 for half ounce, and 184.31 for quarter ounce.
[00:21:08.971 --> 00:21:09.351]  That's 737.26, 368.63, and 184.31.
[00:21:19.475 --> 00:21:25.041]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:29.325]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[00:21:29.325 --> 00:21:37.173]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:21:37.173 --> 00:21:39.536]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:21:39.796 --> 00:21:43.557]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:21:43.557 --> 00:21:49.780]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.041]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:56.062]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[00:21:56.062 --> 00:21:56.322]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.322 --> 00:21:56.502]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.471 --> 00:22:08.216]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:08.216 --> 00:22:10.858]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:12.419]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:13.219]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:13.219 --> 00:22:14.180]  This is his ammo.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.581]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:17.022]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:17.563 --> 00:22:24.730]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:25.211]  Some U.S.
[00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:31.558]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:35.022]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:35.242 --> 00:22:45.524]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:22:45.524 --> 00:22:46.744]  Fabled enemies.
[00:22:46.744 --> 00:22:54.486]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:54.486 --> 00:22:57.867]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:01.844 --> 00:23:06.748]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[00:23:06.748 --> 00:23:12.233]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[00:23:12.233 --> 00:23:14.515]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[00:23:14.515 --> 00:23:17.217]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[00:23:17.217 --> 00:23:20.220]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.162]  Know how to reach campus security.
[00:23:22.162 --> 00:23:25.705]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[00:23:25.705 --> 00:23:28.027]  And always carry a self-defense device.
[00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:32.071]  This important message is brought to you by Pepperspray.com.

[00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:51.931]  That's 800-908-9988.
[00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:52.592]  This is the end.
[00:24:36.422 --> 00:24:43.546]  I'll never look into your eyes.
[00:24:43.546 --> 00:24:52.731]  Alright, here is the news I need to get to.
[00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:56.193]  Man, this is all super heavy.
[00:24:56.193 --> 00:24:59.275]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend.
[00:25:01.298 --> 00:25:02.659]  What have we been telling you for weeks?
[00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:04.921]  They're hoarding the cash.
[00:25:04.921 --> 00:25:12.145]  They're giving none of it to the public or to Main Street corporations.
[00:25:12.145 --> 00:25:28.316]  The big central banks orchestrated the financial collapse so that they could drive down the economy even more, then claim it was a bailout, give themselves trillions of dollars to buy up the assets while they hyperinflate the currency.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.742]  So they're depressing the price of everything to consolidate it.
[00:25:33.742 --> 00:25:36.583]  Once they own even more, it's gonna go hyperinflationary.
[00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:37.844]  It already is.
[00:25:37.844 --> 00:25:39.845]  On Main Street.
[00:25:39.845 --> 00:25:42.946]  Senator predicts a revolution if banks don't lend.
[00:25:42.946 --> 00:25:49.570]  Dodd highlights rising public anger at credit crunch and says, it looks like the banks are hoarding the cash.
[00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.210]  Of course they are.
[00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.731]  And then, oh look, the market's going down more!
[00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:53.612]  Give us even more!
[00:25:53.612 --> 00:25:55.392]  Oh look, it's going down even more!
[00:25:55.392 --> 00:25:56.293]  Give us even more!
[00:25:58.689 --> 00:26:03.791]  By the way, they're not cutting your interest rates on cars and houses and everything.
[00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:09.473]  People are getting higher and higher interest rates if they try to buy a house or a car.
[00:26:09.473 --> 00:26:12.454]  But, they're talking about cutting it down to 1%?
[00:26:12.454 --> 00:26:15.335]  That's only for the banks.
[00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:20.277]  Perino, the White House Press Secretary, says, we'll just have to trust our Secretary on Banker Takeover.
[00:26:20.277 --> 00:26:22.418]  And, Kurt Nimmo did a great story at Infowars.com.
[00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:29.766]  With all the quotes where they're admitting, and mainstream news is admitting, that the Banker Takeover is pretty much secret.
[00:26:29.766 --> 00:26:33.288]  They're just giving each other hundreds of billions of dollars and it's all secret.
[00:26:33.288 --> 00:26:34.809]  And we'll just need to trust them.
[00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:40.132]  EU calls for New World Governance.
[00:26:40.132 --> 00:26:51.759]  This is a ten minute clip and I would play it, but a lot of it's in French and Spanish and it shows them, but then it cuts back to people in English, including the head of the EU.
[00:26:53.999 --> 00:26:57.201]  Where they're calling it New World Order, New World Governance.
[00:26:57.201 --> 00:26:59.123]  I mean, you get to hear it all.
[00:26:59.123 --> 00:27:00.424]  Wise Up Journal did a report on that.
[00:27:00.424 --> 00:27:03.006]  We have a link to it up on Infowars.com.
[00:27:03.006 --> 00:27:04.887]  EU calls for New World Governance.
[00:27:04.887 --> 00:27:14.634]  I mean, every day I see scores of videos and news articles where they're just openly saying a world government run for and by the banks.
[00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:19.558]  Britain may need 0% interest rate to avoid a depression, leading economists warns.
[00:27:22.662 --> 00:27:24.783]  But again, that's for the banks, not the people.
[00:27:24.783 --> 00:27:28.525]  Bernanke battles big-time economic erosion with new rate cuts.
[00:27:28.525 --> 00:27:29.926]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:27:29.926 --> 00:27:33.067]  And then, getting out of financial news, Syria condemns U.S.
[00:27:33.067 --> 00:27:45.314]  raid as terrible crime, a helicopter attack, blowing up some houses in a village, killing at least eight civilians on a Syrian farm.
[00:27:45.314 --> 00:27:49.496]  I mean, this is the type of just rogue behavior.
[00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:56.879]  Going on that makes us look like absolute demons worldwide.
[00:27:56.879 --> 00:27:58.440]  And then there's all this police state news.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.885]  Police will be able to check the identities of people in the street using mobile fingerprint scanners.
[00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:08.148]  All over.
[00:28:08.148 --> 00:28:10.189]  The U.S., the Western world, period.
[00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:12.531]  They're putting in thumb scanners in the cars.
[00:28:12.531 --> 00:28:16.775]  See, they got your thumbprints when you go get your driver's license.
[00:28:16.775 --> 00:28:19.837]  As I told you under the executive order back in the mid-90s, they were planning.
[00:28:21.044 --> 00:28:21.904]  There it is.
[00:28:21.904 --> 00:28:23.765]  ACL uses two-thirds of the U.S.
[00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:26.225]  population lives in Constitution-free zones.
[00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:33.987]  Before 9-11, we had these Agenda 21 125-mile zones, and because two-thirds of the U.S.
[00:28:33.987 --> 00:28:38.827]  population lives on the coastlines and on the borders, that's two-thirds of the population.
[00:28:38.827 --> 00:28:41.708]  Now, they don't search you when you come across the border, generally.
[00:28:41.708 --> 00:28:45.369]  Reports are coming in that it's at these zones, 50 miles, 100 miles.
[00:28:47.665 --> 00:28:50.626]  You know, past major cities, and they stop and search you.
[00:28:50.626 --> 00:28:56.829]  And again, it's all in the name of stopping the illegal alien invasion when they selectively enforce and don't stop that.
[00:28:56.829 --> 00:29:02.132]  And so, again, they sell it in the name of ending illegal immigration.
[00:29:02.132 --> 00:29:03.633]  It has nothing to do with that.
[00:29:03.633 --> 00:29:12.957]  And, you know, we've protested and covered it and gone out there with our cameras at the FEMA camp in Taylor, Texas, north of Austin, where they take whole immigrant families without
[00:29:13.843 --> 00:29:16.344]  Due process, anything, they're children, all of them.
[00:29:16.344 --> 00:29:19.365]  There's playgrounds behind the barbed wire.
[00:29:19.365 --> 00:29:21.026]  With these kids running around in their uniforms.
[00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:23.267]  There's footage of that in Endgame.
[00:29:23.267 --> 00:29:25.828]  And no, I'm against that.
[00:29:25.828 --> 00:29:28.469]  Due process.
[00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:34.312]  But again, they know how to play psychological games.
[00:29:34.312 --> 00:29:36.492]  That is just some of the news I've got.
[00:29:36.492 --> 00:29:39.894]  We're going to detail more of it on the other side and then play this clip.
[00:29:40.916 --> 00:29:46.840]  Called the New World Order for Complete Idiots, which is extremely powerful.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.601]  Stay with us.
[00:29:47.601 --> 00:29:51.384]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.384 --> 00:29:52.785]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:55.287]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.287 --> 00:29:58.008]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.184 --> 00:30:06.527]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[00:30:06.527 --> 00:30:12.970]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.471]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[00:30:15.471 --> 00:30:20.793]  food supplies are dangerously low and we urge you to protect your family with hemp storable foods today.
[00:30:20.793 --> 00:30:22.214]  Tomorrow may be too late.

[00:30:26.716 --> 00:30:30.998]  This incredible food source is loaded with enzymes so your body can digest the food you eat.
[00:30:31.318 --> 00:30:31.638]  I think so.
[00:31:01.023 --> 00:31:14.172]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:17.994]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:18.774]  We're good to go.
[00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:40.099]  I think so.
[00:32:01.408 --> 00:32:05.229]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:32:05.229 --> 00:32:12.332]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:12.332 --> 00:32:13.792]  Here is why.
[00:32:13.792 --> 00:32:23.636]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:32:24.236 --> 00:32:26.978]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:29.099]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:32:29.099 --> 00:32:30.080]  this fall?
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.980]  Don't wait.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.782]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:33:32.703 --> 00:33:33.783]  We are back live.
[00:33:33.783 --> 00:33:38.524]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:38.524 --> 00:33:52.847]  Jesse Ventura had the idea yesterday to come on the radio today or tomorrow to talk about Dean Barclay, who we appointed to be senator, because the states previously, through the legislatures, appointed senators.
[00:33:52.847 --> 00:33:59.828]  That's because the people were voting in the state, and we control the federal government through the states, and so the senators
[00:34:02.478 --> 00:34:06.480]  We're again elected by the people because they were appointed through the legislature, elected by the people.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.721]  But with the 17th Amendment, that was removed.
[00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:28.011]  But a vestige of that, back in 1913, remained that if a senator died... You always wonder how when a senator dies, or a congressman dies, how suddenly, generally, their wife, or sometimes their chief aide, is the senator or congressman, the house member for the next year, six months, sometimes two, three years,
[00:34:30.546 --> 00:34:40.693]  That's because governors can appoint the senator for the rest of that term, and he appointed Dean Barclay, so you can give him the title senator.
[00:34:40.693 --> 00:34:46.777]  Actually, Barclay called me last week, wanted to get on the show, and I just got busy and didn't get back with him.
[00:34:46.777 --> 00:34:49.719]  He was part of the Campaign for Liberty there at the Ron Paul event as well.
[00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.201]  Great guy, great platform.
[00:34:52.201 --> 00:34:53.582]  And Ventura's really good friends with him.
[00:34:53.582 --> 00:34:57.865]  He started telling me, listen, you've got to get him on, you've got to promote the campaign, it's close.
[00:34:57.865 --> 00:34:59.806]  He's got a chance to beat Franken and the other guy.
[00:35:00.977 --> 00:35:02.999]  Uh, and the senator's a big deal.
[00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:04.860]  So that's an important voice to have.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:11.806]  So, uh, but, but, by a stroke of fate, Ted Anderson this morning, it's, flew out on the same flight, I guess, at 7.30.
[00:35:11.806 --> 00:35:13.787]  Their flight left about 30 minutes late.
[00:35:13.787 --> 00:35:14.688]  It must be a 7 a.m.
[00:35:14.688 --> 00:35:15.789]  flight.
[00:35:15.789 --> 00:35:16.590]  I dropped him off there at 6 a.m.
[00:35:17.805 --> 00:35:28.909]  But Ted was on the same plane with Ventura, so I would have thought Ventura would have already been back, but about 30 minutes ago, right before I went on air, Ted called and was like, hey, we just got off the plane with Ventura, so he's got to get home and I've got to line that up.
[00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:40.713]  So sometime next hour or the hour after that, Ventura is going to be on, talk a little bit about what happened here in Austin as well, great time with Willie, out at his place for four hours, and then some of the live reports we did out there.
[00:35:43.618 --> 00:36:01.444]  The man we've been talking about, Dean Barkley, and then poor Celica Stillo, great patriot, shut up, convicted three years in prison, and so we'll be talking to him coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:36:01.444 --> 00:36:06.045]  All right, let me get into the news here.
[00:36:06.045 --> 00:36:09.886]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend.
[00:36:09.886 --> 00:36:10.727]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:12.378 --> 00:36:15.780]  This is an important article on many facets.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.402]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend.
[00:36:19.402 --> 00:36:23.104]  The revolution issue's a big deal.
[00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:27.566]  And then, uh, the fact that he's talking about banks are not lending.
[00:36:27.566 --> 00:36:32.969]  You see, they're hoarding the cash.
[00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:35.190]  Now, you're gonna pay for that cash with tax money.
[00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.351]  You're gonna have to pay that back.
[00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:39.752]  Because that's how the bankers set it up.
[00:36:39.752 --> 00:36:41.313]  When money's created, they get the interest.
[00:36:42.535 --> 00:36:44.476]  And then you get to pay through inflation.
[00:36:44.476 --> 00:36:47.538]  I mean, who comes up with stuff like this?
[00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:53.562]  I mean, and you try to convince the public that when it's all stated, you know, openly, and they say, oh, there's nothing sophisticated.
[00:36:53.562 --> 00:36:57.084]  There's nobody that knows how to do anything like that in the elite.
[00:36:57.084 --> 00:36:58.565]  They just run things because they're idiots.
[00:36:58.565 --> 00:36:59.966]  That's why they're in power.
[00:36:59.966 --> 00:37:01.707]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:37:01.707 --> 00:37:07.551]  In this hyper competitive world, the elite tells you what they're doing to you in giant white papers and government reports, but
[00:37:08.149 --> 00:37:14.814]  The public just, oh no, they don't know how to wipe their noses or tie their shoelaces.
[00:37:14.814 --> 00:37:17.816]  I more and more just look at the abject denial.
[00:37:17.816 --> 00:37:19.357]  But that denial is starting to go away.
[00:37:19.357 --> 00:37:20.358]  People are getting it.
[00:37:20.358 --> 00:37:22.599]  Senator predicts revolution of banks don't lend.
[00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:27.322]  Dodd highlights rising public anger at credit crunch bailout.
[00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:32.246]  Senator Christopher Dodd has shockingly predicted that public anger at banks' refusal
[00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:41.317]  to disperse credit could lead a revolution, while another analyst says government intervention could mean banks are cut out of the loop entirely.
[00:37:41.317 --> 00:37:45.820]  It turns out they're hoarding.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.604]  It turns out that they're hoarding.
[00:37:49.604 --> 00:37:51.145]  You'll have a revolution on your hands.
[00:37:51.145 --> 00:37:57.750]  People will be so livid and furious that their tax money is going into line the pockets instead of doing the right thing.
[00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:58.731]  They will be held to pay.
[00:37:59.867 --> 00:38:12.651]  Well, that's why they've got the face scanning cameras and the gate cameras of how you walk, and the heat residence cameras, and the plate scanners, and the SWAT teams in the FEMA camps.
[00:38:12.651 --> 00:38:16.733]  The British Ministry of Defense report says they're going to take everything we've got in the U.S.
[00:38:16.733 --> 00:38:22.375]  and England and Europe, and the people are going to rebel, and that the troops are going to have to slaughter us in the streets.
[00:38:22.375 --> 00:38:27.817]  Because they work for the bankers, whether they know it or not.
[00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:28.517]  It turns out
[00:38:30.828 --> 00:38:33.429]  If it turns out they're hoarding, you'll have a revolution on your hands.
[00:38:33.429 --> 00:38:39.072]  People will be so livid and furious that their tax money is going to line the pocket instead of doing the right thing.
[00:38:39.072 --> 00:38:42.834]  There will be hell to pay, Dodd told the New York Times this weekend.
[00:38:42.834 --> 00:38:48.496]  And will the public ever figure out the hyperinflation devaluing their paycheck and their currency?
[00:38:48.496 --> 00:38:51.478]  And they've got to pay it back in tax money?
[00:38:51.478 --> 00:38:54.259]  Do you think they're going to get mad then?
[00:38:54.259 --> 00:38:58.461]  No, they're just going to find out that they weren't given the money that was theirs to begin with.
[00:38:59.653 --> 00:39:03.417]  You know, it's bad enough that it'd be like the bankers loaning us our own money.
[00:39:03.417 --> 00:39:04.818]  That's how the scam works.
[00:39:04.818 --> 00:39:06.019]  And then we have to pay interest on it.
[00:39:06.019 --> 00:39:08.862]  It'd be bad enough if they just gave it to us, because nothing's free.
[00:39:08.862 --> 00:39:11.324]  We're going to have to pay for it.
[00:39:11.324 --> 00:39:15.108]  But instead, you get nothing but slavery.
[00:39:15.108 --> 00:39:18.471]  Let me read Senator Dodd again from the New York Times today.
[00:39:18.471 --> 00:39:20.013]  If it turns out that they are hoarding
[00:39:20.635 --> 00:39:21.996]  You'll have a revolution on your hands.
[00:39:21.996 --> 00:39:30.322]  People will be so livid and furious that their tax money is going to line the pockets, instead of doing the right thing, they will be held to pay, doddle the New York Times this weekend.
[00:39:30.322 --> 00:39:49.275]  Meanwhile, Chief Investment Strategist, Sean Corrigan, from... ...Dopison Commodities Management, told CNBC this morning that the banks may have to be cut out of the loop if the freeze in credit markets continues, forcing governments to act as the lender of last resort.
[00:39:49.275 --> 00:39:50.056]  Corrigan said the
[00:39:50.891 --> 00:40:04.115]  That banking was a business which is desperately in need of a call in the world but nobody wants a bank to go down for fear that they will bring other banks down so we're locked ourselves into this position.
[00:40:04.115 --> 00:40:11.318]  Saying that the big mistake by central banks was the move not to save banking but to save individual banks.
[00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:19.854]  Corrigan stated, ultimately, yes, if the banks don't restart, the authorities will have to start acting as the monetizers of last resort.
[00:40:19.854 --> 00:40:28.579]  They'll have to start dispensing commercial credit between non-financial institutions and cut banking out of the loop, if necessary.
[00:40:28.579 --> 00:40:35.403]  As the George Washington Blogspot documents, the banks have openly stated that they will keep hoarding cash no matter how much money the Fed gives them.
[00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.690]  Well, that's the whole point.
[00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.311]  I told you this years ago.
[00:40:40.311 --> 00:40:41.331]  I told you this months ago.
[00:40:41.331 --> 00:40:43.392]  I told you this weeks ago.
[00:40:43.392 --> 00:40:44.752]  You're not going to get that money.
[00:40:44.752 --> 00:40:47.293]  You're just going to pay to give it to the offshore banks.
[00:40:47.293 --> 00:40:54.195]  You're going to pay so when your city goes bankrupt, they've got lobbyists to come in and pay off your politicians.
[00:40:54.195 --> 00:41:04.158]  Your money's going to come right back to pay off politicians to hand over infrastructure to the bankers so they can triple your tolls on those roads and triple the price of your water and everything.
[00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:08.492]  And there are going to be more cops writing more tickets.
[00:41:08.492 --> 00:41:10.693]  And there's going to be more checkpoints.
[00:41:10.693 --> 00:41:20.719]  And there's going to be more homes being taken, and they're massively increasing the number of IRS enforcers now, and giving them basically Homeland Security Patriot Act powers.
[00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:22.320]  Well, not basically, they are.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:28.083]  That was also in the Banker Bailout Bill, but in previous bills, beefing it up, where they can, they're like CIA agents, just do whatever they want.
[00:41:28.083 --> 00:41:32.185]  Of course, it's all on its face criminal.
[00:41:32.185 --> 00:41:32.826]  It's lawless.
[00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:40.145]  But these people are absolutely out of their minds.
[00:41:40.145 --> 00:41:44.788]  And by out of their minds, I mean out of their minds just ravenously grabbing up everything.
[00:41:44.788 --> 00:41:49.851]  I mean, they consciously know what they're doing, but it's still a form of insanity.
[00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:51.992]  We're going to cover more of this later.
[00:41:51.992 --> 00:42:03.159]  We've got the Treasury Secretary, the White House spokesperson, the White House Press Secretary talking about the Treasury Secretary
[00:42:04.346 --> 00:42:11.491]  And saying, well, we're not allowed to see any of these documents.
[00:42:11.491 --> 00:42:13.572]  But that's okay.
[00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:16.534]  Because we just trust our Treasury Secretary.
[00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:17.695]  Alright, here's this video clip.
[00:42:17.695 --> 00:42:20.717]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:20.717 --> 00:42:21.878]  I sent it to you last week, John.
[00:42:21.878 --> 00:42:22.638]  I forgot the title.
[00:42:22.638 --> 00:42:27.141]  It's New World Order for Complete Idiots.
[00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:29.943]  The Complete Idiot's Guide to the New World Order.
[00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:31.965]  We'll play it and play the last few minutes of the next segment.
[00:42:31.965 --> 00:42:32.365]  Stay with us.
[00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:44.513]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:42:44.513 --> 00:42:51.295]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:42:51.295 --> 00:42:56.317]  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
[00:42:56.317 --> 00:43:01.358]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:43:02.387 --> 00:43:12.716]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[00:43:12.716 --> 00:43:24.186]  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it.
[00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:49.384]  On the outskirts of the National Capitol today, black limousines with darkened windows converged on a hotel where private security guards imposed ironclad control.
[00:43:49.384 --> 00:43:57.547]  The limos carried royalty, political power brokers, and industrial titans to a secret meeting that will last all weekend.
[00:43:57.547 --> 00:44:00.368]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:44:00.368 --> 00:44:03.470]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.831]  The Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:44:10.384 --> 00:44:16.689]  Professor Carol Quigley is allowed to examine the confidential papers and secret records of this network.
[00:44:16.689 --> 00:44:30.020]  Quigley reveals that these men aim to create a world system of financial control in private hands, able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:36.586]  In short, they seek total and quiet control of the entire world.
[00:44:38.172 --> 00:44:44.835]  And the CFR is their most visible conduit for carrying out that agenda.
[00:44:44.835 --> 00:44:47.776]  What I'm about to say is fact.
[00:44:47.776 --> 00:44:52.358]  The secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret.
[00:44:52.358 --> 00:44:56.500]  They have planned and are now leading us into a one world communist government.
[00:44:57.248 --> 00:45:09.441]  CNN has even reported that these individuals have put out the policy reports through the Council on Foreign Relations that writes their scholarly white papers to end the United States, to end Canada, and to end Mexico.
[00:45:09.441 --> 00:45:13.324]  I hate to break it to you, but after two years of denying it and saying that this can't be,
[00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:19.670]  It's the only reason that I have found that explains everything that's going on in our country with a border.
[00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:25.295]  Our country has been sold out in the name of global profits and votes at the ballot box.
[00:45:25.295 --> 00:45:31.080]  This is where the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, or SPP, comes in.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:38.067]  This little agreement, international agreement, cooked up by President Bush, the former President of Mexico, and the Prime Minister of Canada.
[00:45:38.827 --> 00:45:45.052]  Their mission is to blur or completely erase the borders between Canada, U.S.
[00:45:45.052 --> 00:45:45.752]  and Mexico.
[00:45:45.752 --> 00:45:52.777]  The Omero is the proposed new currency for the North American community which is being developed right now between Canada, the U.S.
[00:45:52.777 --> 00:45:57.040]  and Mexico to make a borderless community much like the E.U.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.262]  and the dollar, Canadian dollar, U.S.
[00:45:59.262 --> 00:46:01.823]  dollar and Mexican peso replaced by the Omero.
[00:46:01.823 --> 00:46:03.805]  Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[00:46:04.551 --> 00:46:08.455]  Which critics call nothing more than a North American Union.
[00:46:08.455 --> 00:46:16.883]  It brings open borders, commerce at all costs, and by the way, without the approval of either American voters or the U.S.
[00:46:16.883 --> 00:46:17.203]  Congress.
[00:46:20.386 --> 00:46:22.368]  Well, that would be long, long term.
[00:46:22.368 --> 00:46:26.691]  Even the economy is supporting the so-called globalism, and it's not free trade.
[00:46:26.691 --> 00:46:37.438]  Worse, critics say foreign policy elites are promoting a European-style union, erasing borders between the three countries, and eventually moving to a single North American currency called the AMRO.
[00:46:37.438 --> 00:46:45.104]  It would be a 4,000-mile network of new toll roads, with truck and car lanes, rail lines, pipeline, and utility zones.
[00:46:45.104 --> 00:46:46.545]  Its projected cost?
[00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:47.826]  $183 billion over 50 years.
[00:47:01.832 --> 00:47:06.003]  By default of this agreement, the American Constitution will eventually be obsolete.
[00:47:06.852 --> 00:47:11.673]  You would think that a situation like this would be on the cover of every major newspaper.
[00:47:11.673 --> 00:47:17.135]  That is until you realize that the people who are behind this movement are the same people behind the mainstream media.
[00:47:17.135 --> 00:47:19.936]  And you are not told what you're not supposed to know.
[00:47:19.936 --> 00:47:25.877]  The North American Union is the same concept as the European Union, the African Union, and the soon-to-be Asian Union.
[00:47:25.877 --> 00:47:28.318]  And the same people are behind all of them.
[00:47:28.318 --> 00:47:29.658]  And the time is right.
[00:47:29.658 --> 00:47:35.320]  The North American Union, the European Union, the African Union, and the Asian Union will be merged together.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.003]  Vice President Dick Cheney takes a question from David Rockefeller.
[00:47:40.003 --> 00:47:51.851]  Vice President, I just enjoyed so much your whole speech, but I was particularly pleased that you gave such a strong endorsement for the free trade agreement for all the Americans.
[00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:54.513]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:47:54.513 --> 00:48:00.777]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:04.779]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for reelection back home in Wyoming.
[00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:16.797]  I'm, you know, I've never registered as a Republican, but generally speaking, but I think most Americans now say, um, neither side, they're both selling us out.
[00:48:16.797 --> 00:48:32.729]  I was one who supported Evan Frederick Bush, the authority, if necessary to use force, to venture down the chain.
[00:48:39.068 --> 00:48:41.492]  Well, I have a number of people from whom I get policy.
[00:48:41.492 --> 00:48:43.996]  I'm talking to Frank Gaffney, I talk to Richard Haass.
[00:48:43.996 --> 00:48:49.043]  Richard Haass served under Colin Powell during this Bush administration over at the State Department.
[00:48:49.043 --> 00:48:51.647]  He's now the President of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:49:09.686 --> 00:49:20.510]  They see themselves as a government as opposed to a group of world leaders or people with influence at a global level who are talking about global issues, do they?
[00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.631]  They see themselves as headhunters.
[00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:32.454]  They'll get an up-and-coming politician who they think may be president or prime minister one day, and as globalist, industrialist leaders who believe that politics
[00:49:32.854 --> 00:49:34.615]  Shouldn't be in the hands of the politicians.
[00:49:34.615 --> 00:49:39.276]  People talk to me about, you know, the issue of Republican versus Democrat, as if they don't get it.
[00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.737]  And I say, look, here's the way you get it.
[00:49:41.737 --> 00:49:43.437]  It's organized crime.
[00:49:43.437 --> 00:49:48.799]  All you do is you call the Republicans the Genoveses, and you call the Democrats the Gambinos.
[00:49:48.799 --> 00:49:54.860]  The people at the top, they treat it like a crap game, like it's their crap game, like they're making lots of money.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:50:00.062]  Occasionally, somebody at the table shoots each other, but the moment anything threatens their crap game,
[00:50:00.502 --> 00:50:02.184]  They all unite to protect me.
[00:50:02.184 --> 00:50:06.148]  They're both controlled by the same financial, economic, and corporate interests.
[00:50:06.148 --> 00:50:14.197]  We have before us the opportunity to forge, for ourselves and for future generations, a new world order.
[00:50:14.197 --> 00:50:20.084]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[00:50:21.361 --> 00:50:27.825]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this New World Order.
[00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:29.226]  It used to be more secretive.
[00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:34.629]  You know, the New World Order was talked about 30 or 40 years ago, and nobody would say it out in open.
[00:50:34.629 --> 00:50:36.770]  Now they talk about the New World Order.
[00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.172]  They just think the world would be better off if we had one world government.
[00:50:40.172 --> 00:50:40.652]  I don't.
[00:50:40.652 --> 00:50:43.133]  I mean, I don't even like the size of our federal government, let alone the world.
[00:50:43.133 --> 00:50:44.094]  All right, stay there.
[00:50:44.094 --> 00:50:45.655]  Stay there.
[00:50:45.655 --> 00:50:49.557]  We're going to come back, finish up the last few minutes of this, get into a bunch of other news.
[00:50:50.561 --> 00:51:01.786]  And later we are going to be having Ventura and Dean Barkley pop in about election and a lot more and then Seneca still a convicted three years.
[00:51:01.786 --> 00:51:03.947]  High gasoline prices got you down.
[00:51:03.947 --> 00:51:06.868]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:51:06.868 --> 00:51:12.550]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.
[00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:16.172]  Mechanics charge up to $300 to clean your fuel system.

[00:52:01.224 --> 00:52:07.972]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.972 --> 00:52:10.616]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.616 --> 00:52:12.157]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:12.157 --> 00:52:12.978]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.978 --> 00:52:13.920]  This is his MO.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.341]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:16.563]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.324 --> 00:52:24.470]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.951]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:31.297]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:31.297 --> 00:52:34.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:45.268]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:45.268 --> 00:52:46.508]  Fabled enemies.
[00:52:46.508 --> 00:52:54.274]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:54.274 --> 00:52:57.637]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:06.715 --> 00:53:09.698]  What will you do when it happens?
[00:53:09.698 --> 00:53:14.621]  When you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation and fear?
[00:53:14.621 --> 00:53:21.005]  Or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with Patriotfood.com?
[00:53:21.005 --> 00:53:22.886]  The signs are everywhere.
[00:53:22.886 --> 00:53:24.908]  You have no excuses.
[00:53:24.908 --> 00:53:29.151]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:35.275]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:40.879]  Patriotfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound.

[00:53:44.901 --> 00:53:51.426]  Varieties like dried tomatoes, wild rice blend, beef base, granola, vegetable mix, and much more.
[00:53:51.426 --> 00:53:54.167]  There are just two kinds of people.
[00:53:54.167 --> 00:53:56.169]  Slave and free.
[00:53:56.169 --> 00:53:57.210]  Be ready.
[00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:57.790]  Be free.
[00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:16.480]  Day after day Alone on a hill The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
[00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:49.342]  We've been mainly playing clips of big time presidents, prime ministers calling for a new world order, discussions of it in the news, but there are thousands of clips of
[00:54:49.961 --> 00:55:02.810]  Professors, and university heads, and bankers, and think tanks, and the UN, and the Club of Rome, and the CFR, and Trilateral Commission, and books written by German chancellors and British prime ministers.
[00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:06.333]  I mean, just openly admitting how they run everything, how they do it.
[00:55:06.333 --> 00:55:10.315]  I mean, it's all stated by them.
[00:55:10.315 --> 00:55:13.598]  It's like I read a TV guide here on air every day and tell you what's going to be on TV.
[00:55:13.598 --> 00:55:15.599]  And people are like, oh, is it true?
[00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:16.680]  Or how does he know all this?
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.481]  I mean, it's not even hard.
[00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:19.482]  It's just all admitted.
[00:55:20.222 --> 00:55:21.223]  Let's finish up with this clip.
[00:55:31.944 --> 00:55:50.104]  There's a very, very clear-cut and easily identifiable system in place that puts all of these elements from media control to government control to energy control together into one apparatus working together effectively towards its final goal, which is, you know, global control.
[00:55:51.113 --> 00:55:54.034]  A new world is emerging.
[00:55:54.034 --> 00:55:56.094]  It is a new world order.
[00:55:56.094 --> 00:55:59.835]  It's a phrase that I often use myself, that we needed a new world order.
[00:55:59.835 --> 00:56:10.318]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used, and that is a new world order.
[00:56:10.318 --> 00:56:18.480]  We're inside a cabal, a conspiracy, if you will, to take control of the United States, lead us into a one world government run by them.
[00:56:23.207 --> 00:56:36.692]  All right, folks, while I'm playing that clip, I'm talking to Ventura right now.
[00:56:36.692 --> 00:56:39.773]  Jesse, I'll call you right back.
[00:56:39.773 --> 00:56:46.096]  I'll tell you, folks, I'm in here doing production because I was working out that gift.
[00:56:46.096 --> 00:56:46.256]  It was
[00:56:47.228 --> 00:56:54.994]  So I'm here playing clips and doing production here on the phone while I'm at it.
[00:56:54.994 --> 00:57:03.761]  I need to go ahead and call Ventura back and then call Dean Barkley and I guess go ahead and get those guys on.
[00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:07.764]  We'll go ahead and do it about eight after.
[00:57:07.764 --> 00:57:10.426]  That's why this radio show has such total transparency now.
[00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:16.731]  We don't have time to even cut liners separately from the live show, so we do it on the radio.
[00:57:18.248 --> 00:57:23.270]  Uh, we do behind the scenes now most of the times where we're live on video even during the breaks.
[00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:28.673]  And it's kind of neat though, but people can get an idea of what really goes on around here and how we're flying by the seat of our pants.
[00:57:28.673 --> 00:57:45.059]  I don't know how the idea has gotten out there that I'm like some super mastermind brainiac and we're all slick and all knowing and all controlling the Patriot movement when I'm always actually trying to control, uh, you know, the dog not getting out of the fence and getting run over.
[00:57:45.059 --> 00:57:46.060]  And, uh,
[00:57:48.547 --> 00:58:01.156]  You know, I'm trying to control dealing with my taxes and trying to control dealing with heartburn.
[00:58:01.156 --> 00:58:03.558]  There's so much news and information coming up.
[00:58:03.558 --> 00:58:11.164]  I'm going to go ahead and... I shouldn't have gotten off the phone with Ventura.
[00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:17.195]  I needed to finish that but I was kind of caught there with the clip ending.
[00:58:17.195 --> 00:58:28.006]  So we'll come back and we will get Ventura and them on the show.
[00:58:28.006 --> 00:58:28.907]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:42.777 --> 00:58:46.180]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.385 --> 00:58:53.607]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:58:53.607 --> 00:58:56.129]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:58:56.129 --> 00:58:58.251]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:58.251 --> 00:58:59.812]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:59.812 --> 00:59:01.454]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:59:01.454 --> 00:59:04.416]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:59:04.416 --> 00:59:08.059]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:59:14.127 --> 00:59:17.689]  We've allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:59:17.689 --> 00:59:23.592]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:59:23.592 --> 00:59:26.353]  An inside job?
[00:59:26.353 --> 00:59:28.794]  How dare you?
[00:59:28.794 --> 00:59:34.037]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:36.638]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:59:42.222 --> 00:59:43.224]  Truth Rising.

[00:59:53.938 --> 00:59:56.321]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.321 --> 00:59:59.104]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.649 --> 01:00:06.950]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.730]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.491]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:12.051]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:12.952]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.952 --> 01:00:17.813]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:21.875]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.275 --> 01:01:01.656]  Okay folks we got Jesse Ventura coming up in the next segment and we'll briefly talk about the great time we had here in Austin for almost four hours with Willie Nelson out of his ranch and then some of the live reports we did out there from the event and we're not sure if some of that went out over the web they had kind of a bad internet connection out there but we've got the tapes and it's all going to go on the internet but
[01:01:03.502 --> 01:01:10.408]  We're mainly talking about the election and several other issues and Dean Barkley and the chance he's got to win the Senate up there.
[01:01:10.408 --> 01:01:11.749]  So that is coming up.
[01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:20.016]  And then Celica Stillo, falsely accused and set up by the BATF, you know, the former DEA agent who blew the whistle on government drug dealing.
[01:01:20.016 --> 01:01:22.198]  One of many, but one of the most prominent.
[01:01:22.198 --> 01:01:25.040]  One of the first big ones.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.964]  So he'll be coming up and joining us in about two hours from now.
[01:01:28.964 --> 01:01:31.566]  He was convicted three years in prison.
[01:01:33.101 --> 01:01:36.402]  And so, uh, that is coming up.
[01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:40.302]  Earlier I played a clip of all these world leaders and others calling for a new world order, world government.
[01:01:40.302 --> 01:01:41.523]  It's all over the news today.
[01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:45.444]  But they're just intensifying the call for the bankers to run everything.
[01:01:45.444 --> 01:01:46.484]  They're saying, you don't have a choice.
[01:01:46.484 --> 01:01:49.084]  We'll destroy the economy if you don't give us total power.
[01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:52.665]  And meanwhile, when they're given the total power, they just squeeze even tighter.
[01:01:52.665 --> 01:01:55.086]  They're just completely ruthless.
[01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:57.326]  Uh, so that is, that is coming up.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.523]  But John, pull up Renegades because I need to give you the number for Ventura and line that up.
[01:02:04.523 --> 01:02:05.883]  And let's go out of this break.
[01:02:05.883 --> 01:02:08.324]  We're about a minute with Renegades.
[01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:12.626]  Or we can play that Maddest Hell clip you put together.
[01:02:12.626 --> 01:02:14.867]  Or, you know, one of those.
[01:02:14.867 --> 01:02:16.608]  And in fact, that's probably a good one to play.
[01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.249]  And then we'll get our guest on.
[01:02:19.249 --> 01:02:24.512]  I'm a little bit bumpy today because I went to bed about 1.30 and I got up at 4.55.
[01:02:28.785 --> 01:02:31.447]  Go pick Ventura up and take him to the airport for his flight out at seven.
[01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.648]  They had headwinds, that's why he's late.
[01:02:33.648 --> 01:02:36.670]  And it took him four hours to get back instead of two and a half down here.
[01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.051]  Boy, headwind can really do that.
[01:02:38.051 --> 01:02:38.391]  Uh, John?
[01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:43.495]  Alright, we're gonna go out of break here with Renegades while we get our next guest lined up.
[01:02:43.495 --> 01:02:43.975]  Stay with us.
[01:02:56.531 --> 01:03:07.119]  From Nazareth he came with a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:14.345]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand for that.
[01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:21.871]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[01:03:23.644 --> 01:03:31.535]  Wise men follow him Where he roams again Wise men follow him
[01:03:51.676 --> 01:03:59.338]  When it comes to heroes, Renegade, you're mine.
[01:03:59.338 --> 01:04:16.924]  They railed against the crown, Another ragtag band, Declaring independence.
[01:04:20.134 --> 01:04:26.175]  Ain't their bodies down on a bloody wall?
[01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:30.536]  And liberty for their descendants?
[01:04:30.536 --> 01:04:36.658]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today.
[01:04:36.658 --> 01:04:41.619]  Thanks to the renegades, we're free today.
[01:05:01.488 --> 01:05:01.768]  I think so.
[01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:19.282]  I think?
[01:05:49.002 --> 01:05:53.785]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:53.785 --> 01:05:55.185]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:11.154 --> 01:06:12.715]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:12.715 --> 01:06:13.516]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:13.516 --> 01:06:14.596]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:15.877]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.877 --> 01:06:17.878]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.878 --> 01:06:25.023]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:25.503]  Some U.S.
[01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:31.847]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.847 --> 01:06:35.309]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:45.815]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:45.815 --> 01:06:47.056]  Fabled enemies.

[01:07:10.995 --> 01:07:19.400]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:25.124]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[01:07:27.146 --> 01:07:29.429]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[01:08:01.804 --> 01:08:06.988]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.988 --> 01:08:09.511]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:16.903 --> 01:08:32.654]  I have to say, I admired Jesse Ventura previously, but really getting to spend a few days with him and ride around all over Texas with him and hang out for almost four hours yesterday with Willie Nelson out at his ranch and last night doing live reports from out there at that event.
[01:08:32.654 --> 01:08:36.296]  It had so many bands, so many people crammed into it for the last day at the backyard.
[01:08:36.296 --> 01:08:38.398]  It was just, it was wonderful.
[01:08:38.398 --> 01:08:45.943]  We're going to spend a few minutes on that and Jesse's overall view on the election and the t-shirt he was wearing yesterday that I think said it all succinctly.
[01:08:46.636 --> 01:08:52.638]  Uh, and then we're going to talk about somebody who is actually trying to take action and who was, you know, there at the Ron Paul campaign for liberty.
[01:08:52.638 --> 01:08:56.699]  Uh, somebody who is, uh, you know, uh, pro-liberty, pro-freedom.
[01:08:56.699 --> 01:09:04.562]  The other two are bad to worse with the Republican and the Democrat, uh, that, uh, Dean Barkley, uh, is, uh, running against the Minnesota.
[01:09:04.562 --> 01:09:05.622]  This is a chance to get
[01:09:06.374 --> 01:09:08.255]  Yeah, Alex, I feel like you're in my back pocket.
[01:09:28.607 --> 01:09:31.249]  I've been together with you so much.
[01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:36.153]  No, the flight got delayed a little bit, and so I got into Minneapolis a little later than expected.
[01:09:36.153 --> 01:09:40.456]  I didn't actually touch down on the ground until about a little over an hour ago.
[01:09:40.456 --> 01:09:42.417]  And you had some headwinds, too, didn't you?
[01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:43.338]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:09:43.338 --> 01:09:53.385]  It must have been, because like I said, it got delayed about 15 at Austin, and then it actually ended up a delay of about 40 flying through the air, so there must have been some pretty good winds up there.
[01:09:53.385 --> 01:09:57.488]  I bumped it a little bit, you know, but it's a good flight because you walk away from it.
[01:09:57.888 --> 01:10:02.472]  Well, your flight was 30 minutes early getting here, so I guess you had tailwinds then.
[01:10:02.472 --> 01:10:05.875]  Well, bottom line, you got back safe and we appreciate you coming down.
[01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:13.401]  Hey, you've been on at Willie's Place before, but we got the grand treatment this time.
[01:10:13.401 --> 01:10:14.262]  That was pretty amazing.
[01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:16.071]  Oh, it was a lot of fun.
[01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:19.494]  You know, Willie owns a beautiful ranch down there in Austin.
[01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:21.175]  He sits right on top of the hill.
[01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.937]  The view from his place is just breathtaking.
[01:10:23.937 --> 01:10:32.724]  And his place is very uniquely built, architecturally and all that, so it's a lot of fun to walk around it and see it.
[01:10:32.724 --> 01:10:37.347]  And then, of course, he's got his whole western town out there that you can spend time in.
[01:10:37.347 --> 01:10:39.489]  It's like walking onto the set of Gunsmoke.
[01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:40.950]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:10:57.007 --> 01:11:05.873]  For all the fame and fortune that Willie has, he's still a down-to-earth type guy who really has feelings for the regular human being out there.
[01:11:05.873 --> 01:11:09.575]  You can tell it by what Willie does, you know, with all of his farm aid.
[01:11:09.575 --> 01:11:11.236]  He's always out to help people.
[01:11:11.236 --> 01:11:17.239]  In fact, that's probably one of his problems is he always tries to help people too much.
[01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:22.943]  You know, and he gets caught up in all the things that he's doing all the time, and I'm sure it's difficult to keep it all straight for him.
[01:11:23.763 --> 01:11:27.673]  Yeah, certainly a lot of stuff going on.
[01:11:27.673 --> 01:11:31.322]  Shifting gears into the election overall, tell us about that t-shirt.
[01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:42.603]  Oh, well, I actually got that t-shirt I was wearing in Arizona when I was out there due on 9-11 for the anniversary and out there.
[01:11:42.603 --> 01:11:54.328]  And it's a big red t-shirt and at the top in white lettering it says 2008 election and it's got McCain with a box, Obama with a box, and anyone but with a box.
[01:11:54.328 --> 01:11:58.770]  And on this particular t-shirt, anyone but has the checkmark.
[01:11:59.688 --> 01:12:04.531]  Not Obama and not McCain, anyone but.
[01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:09.795]  And that's kind of how I feel, Alex, because I won't vote Democrat, I won't vote Republican.
[01:12:09.795 --> 01:12:13.778]  They're the ones that have gotten us into this economical mess.
[01:12:13.778 --> 01:12:17.640]  I think I said it before on your show, I'll say it again.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.503]  Nobody in these two parties paid attention to that federal deficit.
[01:12:21.903 --> 01:12:32.232]  They're still not paying attention to that federal deficit, and we cannot have a vibrant economy when you have that type of debt hanging over your head constantly.
[01:12:32.232 --> 01:12:35.535]  They must cut government spending.
[01:12:35.535 --> 01:12:44.083]  They must do that in which to get rid of that debt, and once they get rid of that debt, the economy and the value of the dollar will start coming back.
[01:12:44.855 --> 01:12:45.815]  You've had more time now.
[01:12:45.815 --> 01:12:49.136]  I mean, you were against it from day one, but you've had more time to look at the bailout.
[01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:50.817]  I've got the New York Times.
[01:12:50.817 --> 01:12:51.857]  Senator Dodd today.
[01:12:51.857 --> 01:12:54.618]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend.
[01:12:54.618 --> 01:12:56.499]  That's the New York Times.
[01:12:56.499 --> 01:12:59.640]  He says that they're hoarding the money.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.501]  They're not even giving it out to get the economy going.
[01:13:03.501 --> 01:13:05.102]  Well, then why did we give it to them?
[01:13:06.567 --> 01:13:07.688]  It's unbelievable.
[01:13:07.688 --> 01:13:11.030]  It's our money and it's supposed to come back to us, isn't it?
[01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:13.992]  I mean, I don't understand the whole thing to begin with.
[01:13:13.992 --> 01:13:15.994]  It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.
[01:13:17.407 --> 01:13:18.087]  Absolutely.
[01:13:18.087 --> 01:13:21.409]  I mean, it's confusing because it's our money.
[01:13:21.409 --> 01:13:29.592]  So in other words, we're giving our money to the government, who's giving it to the banks, who then are supposed to give it back to us?
[01:13:29.592 --> 01:13:30.733]  Yeah, let me read the quote.
[01:13:30.733 --> 01:13:33.434]  This is Senator Dodd, New York Times, Sunday.
[01:13:33.434 --> 01:13:36.075]  If it turns out they're hoarding, you'll have a revolution on your hands.
[01:13:36.075 --> 01:13:40.337]  People will be so livid and furious that their tax money is going to line their pockets.
[01:13:40.337 --> 01:13:45.179]  Instead of doing the right thing, they will be held to pay, Dodd told the New York Times this weekend.
[01:13:46.693 --> 01:13:54.035]  Well, you know, Alex, it doesn't surprise me because has George Bush done anything right yet?
[01:13:54.035 --> 01:13:56.696]  Well, he's done stuff right for his buddies, but no.
[01:13:56.696 --> 01:13:59.136]  No, no, no, I mean for the country and his job.
[01:13:59.136 --> 01:14:02.477]  I can't think of one thing that he's done right yet.
[01:14:02.477 --> 01:14:14.060]  So why would I think that all of a sudden he will do something right when he's only got a couple months to go until he jumps ship and leaves us all on this big sinking ship that he put holes into?
[01:14:16.283 --> 01:14:18.043]  I'm laughing, but I'm almost crying here.
[01:14:18.043 --> 01:14:20.804]  No, no, it's pathetic.
[01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:42.770]  You do want to cry about it, but I mean, you know, I urge everybody, people may not be an Oliver Stone fan, but go see the movie W. Because it'll show you really kind of a, in its own way, a bit of a sarcastic look on Bush's life, and you see that everything he did, he left in disarray.
[01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:43.250]  Everything.
[01:14:43.889 --> 01:14:44.910]  Well, he's certainly a puppet.
[01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:48.411]  Before we get into Dean Barclay, I want to get into that in just a minute.
[01:14:48.411 --> 01:14:59.675]  You know, you never said vote for Barack Obama, but I remember about eight months ago here on the show, you said, because he was saying he was going to get us out of the war, he was going to say no to wiretapping, and you said, look out Barack Obama, look out for assassination.
[01:14:59.675 --> 01:15:04.157]  But now it seems you've soured towards him even more in the interviews we did.
[01:15:04.157 --> 01:15:09.239]  Oh, well, because he's already fudging, for lack of a better term.
[01:15:09.859 --> 01:15:18.047]  You know, now it's, well, we're not going to immediately leave Iraq, and now it's, well, you know, we're not going to do this, we're not going to do that.
[01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:25.794]  See, he's getting caught up into the same two-party quagmire, or the two-party dictatorship that we now live under.
[01:15:26.514 --> 01:15:27.676]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:15:44.595 --> 01:15:46.416]  And I hope I can do it.
[01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:54.582]  But all these people that think this massive change is going to take place because you're now going to elect a Democrat.
[01:15:54.582 --> 01:15:56.643]  I got news for you people.
[01:15:56.643 --> 01:16:00.525]  Democrats have been getting elected for a long, long time.
[01:16:00.525 --> 01:16:01.726]  And nothing changes.
[01:16:04.708 --> 01:16:12.875]  That's right, and there's not any hint that we're getting out any sooner or anything of that nature.
[01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:16.819]  It's laughable to the point you'll want to cry.
[01:16:16.819 --> 01:16:19.301]  Now there is a silver lining to all this.
[01:16:19.301 --> 01:16:26.587]  Let's get into Senator, because he was there for a month or so after Wellstone's tragic death in that plane crash.
[01:16:26.587 --> 01:16:31.412]  Dean Barkley, tell us about this guy, and it's a close race, and we're coming down here in the last eight, nine days.
[01:16:32.012 --> 01:16:33.914]  Dean is sitting right now.
[01:16:33.914 --> 01:16:36.896]  Let me put it this way for you and all your listeners, Alex.
[01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:41.079]  There would be no Governor Jesse Ventura without Dean Barclay.
[01:16:41.079 --> 01:16:42.941]  Senator Dean Barclay.
[01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:50.386]  Because he was the guy up here in Minnesota that went out on the line before I ever got involved much in politics.
[01:16:50.386 --> 01:16:56.071]  And he ran and got my party, the Independence Party, the third party movement of Minnesota going.
[01:16:56.591 --> 01:17:09.061]  By gaining, he got enough votes and he busted his butt that he got us, in our state, if you get over 5% of a statewide vote, that then makes you Major Party.
[01:17:09.061 --> 01:17:12.063]  You then achieve Major Party status.
[01:17:12.063 --> 01:17:21.150]  Well, coming along with Major Party status generally means you get to participate in the debates, which is essential.
[01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:24.233]  Like at the national level, they hold the bar there at about 15 or 20%.
[01:17:26.034 --> 01:17:41.359]  To keep any third party from debating, and even when Ross Perot got damned 19.7%, if you remember, they didn't even let him in the debates in 96 after he got one out of five votes, because they raised the bar even higher again.
[01:17:41.359 --> 01:17:49.362]  Well, in Minnesota, fortunately, when you get 5%, if you achieve that, then you're allowed in the debates, pretty much.
[01:17:49.362 --> 01:17:52.203]  There have been exceptions where they have excluded people.
[01:17:53.024 --> 01:18:17.007]  One of them was the reason I named Dean Barclay a senator, because when Senator Wellstone was killed in the plane crash, I was going to name the winner of the election so that they would have seniority, but then when Walter Mondale, the Democrat, came in to replace Wellstone, he would not debate unless our candidate was excluded, and they did it.
[01:18:17.627 --> 01:18:19.009]  So then I got angry.
[01:18:19.009 --> 01:18:20.591]  I thought, how dare them?
[01:18:20.591 --> 01:18:25.396]  How can they exclude the party that the seated governor belongs to?
[01:18:25.396 --> 01:18:28.719]  So that was at the point that I named Dean Barclay the U.S.
[01:18:28.719 --> 01:18:33.585]  Senator, which he was the most productive senator in four weeks in Minnesota history.
[01:18:34.225 --> 01:18:37.966]  For the four weeks that he was in Washington until, you know, the end of the year.
[01:18:37.966 --> 01:18:43.448]  But he is now running, and Alex, he's right in the position I was in.
[01:18:43.448 --> 01:18:46.689]  He's polling a little over 20% with a week to go.
[01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:48.510]  That's right where I was at.
[01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:49.930]  And he needs some funding.
[01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:52.091]  This is a guy, we don't take PAC money.
[01:18:52.091 --> 01:18:54.351]  We don't take special interest money.
[01:18:54.351 --> 01:18:56.112]  We don't have a national party.
[01:18:56.112 --> 01:18:58.793]  So we're at an extreme disadvantage.
[01:18:59.353 --> 01:19:02.574]  And I'm appealing to all your listeners out there.
[01:19:02.574 --> 01:19:05.695]  It's SenatorBarclay.com over the internet.
[01:19:05.695 --> 01:19:08.156]  This is a guy like Dr. Paul.
[01:19:08.156 --> 01:19:09.236]  He's the independent.
[01:19:09.236 --> 01:19:11.617]  He believes in the Constitution.
[01:19:11.617 --> 01:19:13.998]  And we've got to break this two-party.
[01:19:13.998 --> 01:19:15.418]  And he needs to raise about $35,000 to $50,000.
[01:19:17.999 --> 01:19:19.001]  I don't think so.
[01:19:33.857 --> 01:19:44.680]  Yeah, I was talking to him this morning about that, so we have a chance to get him in.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.041]  Because he's already got what, he was telling me like a hundred and something thousand for the TV ads.
[01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:51.162]  He needs another 30 to 40, he'll be able to run the full package.
[01:19:51.162 --> 01:19:58.083]  And I think he said he spent like a hundred thousand and they've spent millions and he's close to being able to beat him.
[01:19:58.083 --> 01:20:00.764]  We're going to come back and talk to Jesse Ventura and Mr. Barkley.
[01:20:01.601 --> 01:20:03.382]  The economy is collapsing all around us.
[01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:04.243]  Banks are closing.
[01:20:04.243 --> 01:20:09.007]  The Federal Reserve continues to pump billions of dollars into the system to try to stop the bleeding.
[01:20:09.007 --> 01:20:10.588]  Know who is to blame.
[01:20:10.588 --> 01:20:12.670]  The Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:15.092]  On November 22nd, the end begins.
[01:20:15.092 --> 01:20:16.433]  Every Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:20:16.433 --> 01:20:17.614]  Every Federal Reserve Office.
[01:20:17.614 --> 01:20:18.814]  38 cities.
[01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:19.655]  One purpose.
[01:20:19.655 --> 01:20:20.456]  End the Fed.
[01:20:20.456 --> 01:20:20.696]  Visit
[01:20:20.896 --> 01:20:23.458]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:25.158]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:20:25.158 --> 01:20:28.320]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:20:44.029 --> 01:20:45.051]  It is liquid.
[01:20:45.051 --> 01:20:46.072]  It is private.
[01:20:46.072 --> 01:20:46.893]  It owes no one.
[01:20:46.893 --> 01:20:48.635]  It cannot go bankrupt.
[01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:50.637]  And it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.360]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:53.941]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:01.633 --> 01:21:03.594]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:21:03.594 --> 01:21:07.075]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:21:07.075 --> 01:21:09.656]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:12.697]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:21:12.697 --> 01:21:18.439]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:21:18.439 --> 01:21:22.340]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:22:01.693 --> 01:22:03.474]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[01:22:03.474 --> 01:22:05.676]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:07.458]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:22:07.458 --> 01:22:08.298]  Sound familiar?
[01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:11.761]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[01:22:31.316 --> 01:22:37.639]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[01:22:37.639 --> 01:22:39.500]  Got the remote!
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.120]  Oh, my keys!
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.481]  There's my wallet!

[01:23:33.818 --> 01:23:35.019]  It's that simple.
[01:23:35.019 --> 01:23:35.739]  Fresh.
[01:23:35.739 --> 01:23:36.599]  Healthy.

[01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:56.127]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, hot on the heels of being down here in Austin.
[01:24:15.697 --> 01:24:17.819]  He told me, look, this guy is great.
[01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:20.881]  This guy, you know, part of the Ron Paul liberty deal.
[01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:21.841]  He was there.
[01:24:21.841 --> 01:24:22.642]  He's a constitutionalist.
[01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:24.483]  He's the guy that got me into government.
[01:24:24.483 --> 01:24:25.924]  He's the guy that lays the trail.
[01:24:25.924 --> 01:24:27.365]  We need to get him in.
[01:24:27.365 --> 01:24:32.689]  And the key here is Jesse Ventura was 10 points behind a week before the election.
[01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:35.752]  He was eight points behind going into the weekend of the election.
[01:24:35.752 --> 01:24:41.135]  And he won because you got 30 plus percent or around 30 percent that are undecided.
[01:24:41.135 --> 01:24:44.378]  This is key and both parties are very unpopular right now.
[01:24:45.298 --> 01:24:52.464]  I want to bring Dean Barkley up to explain how much more money they've spent compared to what he's spent, and some of the things we can do to help him.
[01:24:52.464 --> 01:24:59.270]  But, Governor Ventura, before we bring Senator Barkley in, finish up with the key point.
[01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:05.355]  I mean, you were there, you lived it, about the similarities to your race and his race right now.
[01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:08.302]  Well, the similarities are great.
[01:25:08.302 --> 01:25:14.226]  I mean, our slogan back in 98 was retaliate in 98.
[01:25:14.226 --> 01:25:20.930]  And I would tell you with the way the public sentiment is today, it would be double retaliate in 08.
[01:25:22.173 --> 01:25:28.775]  Because the people today, to me, are twice as angry as they were back in 98 when they elected me.
[01:25:28.775 --> 01:25:34.658]  And they need to act upon that anger, and that anger needs to be shown to the two parties.
[01:25:34.658 --> 01:25:38.159]  You know, this would be a bombshell across the nation.
[01:25:38.159 --> 01:25:47.322]  If Dean Barkley upsets Senator Norm Coleman and comedian Al Franken, it'll be a shockwave the same as mine was.
[01:25:47.322 --> 01:25:49.143]  You all remember when I won back in 98.
[01:25:50.063 --> 01:25:51.343]  How they were so stunned.
[01:25:51.343 --> 01:26:02.086]  I think Dan Rather said it would be more popular to see Fidel Castro riding across the Rocky Mountains or something than Jesse Ventura winning the Governor of Minnesota.
[01:26:02.086 --> 01:26:08.108]  Well, we can do that same type of explosion right now and it'll happen next week.
[01:26:08.108 --> 01:26:15.150]  And believe me, it would be like a hard, hard left jab right to the nose of both of these parties.
[01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:17.812]  Yeah, one senator can do a lot.
[01:26:17.812 --> 01:26:20.335]  I mean, look what one congressman like Ron Paul can do.
[01:26:33.115 --> 01:26:38.876]  Well, especially, Alex, especially in the case of the Senate, because they're very, very close.
[01:26:38.876 --> 01:26:52.078]  Now, it appears the Dems may get a wider margin, but, you know, Dean Barclay going out there would be a very strong power broker, because he would be a bargaining chip for both of these sides, would have to.
[01:26:52.078 --> 01:26:54.519]  He would be a very powerful position to be in.
[01:26:54.519 --> 01:26:55.419]  And he's already been there.
[01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:58.019]  That's the Senate seat that I was going to go for.
[01:26:58.019 --> 01:27:00.460]  Yes, and no doubt you would have wanted to have gone for it, but...
[01:27:01.855 --> 01:27:02.875]  I don't know.
[01:27:02.875 --> 01:27:04.656]  Oh, come on, Ventura.
[01:27:04.656 --> 01:27:09.918]  Hey, I understand you've got a lot of stuff on the burner, and we talked about it, we can't talk about it now, that is going to be even probably more effective.
[01:27:09.918 --> 01:27:11.618]  We're glad Dean's doing it.
[01:27:11.618 --> 01:27:18.280]  Bringing up Dean Barclay, who was appointed Senator for a month in Wellstone's death, so he's been there before.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.822]  Sir, how do we help you, and how do we raise this money to get these ads on?
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.141]  Well, we're at a tipping point right now.
[01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:30.322]  You know, both my opponents have spent over $30 million each.
[01:27:30.322 --> 01:27:31.182]  $30 million.
[01:27:31.182 --> 01:27:35.724]  And I've spent about $50,000 so far, and I'm within range to beat these guys.
[01:27:35.724 --> 01:27:37.205]  We've got to do our TV campaign.
[01:27:37.205 --> 01:27:44.207]  It's going to start running on Thursday, and we need to raise enough money to have the impact, just like Jesse did the last weekend of the campaign.
[01:27:44.207 --> 01:27:48.949]  We ran his ads, and that convinced people that I could win, and we're very, very close right now.
[01:27:49.369 --> 01:27:55.077]  If they want to send money, go to my website, which is www.senatorbarclay.com.
[01:27:55.077 --> 01:27:59.082]  Or if they want to call my office and put a donation that way, the phone number is 763-417-9972.
[01:27:59.082 --> 01:28:01.064]  You know, with another $50,000 or $60,000, I can win this race.
[01:28:01.064 --> 01:28:01.545]  It's winnable.
[01:28:01.545 --> 01:28:02.106]  And Jesse's right.
[01:28:08.073 --> 01:28:10.995]  Uh, this would be a shockwave that Congress would pay attention to.
[01:28:10.995 --> 01:28:13.037]  Say, my God, Barclay's coming here.
[01:28:13.037 --> 01:28:15.618]  If we don't change our ways, maybe we're going to be next.
[01:28:15.618 --> 01:28:17.299]  Well, the bully pulled... Pay attention to this.
[01:28:17.299 --> 01:28:19.441]  Well, the bully pulled, but you would have as well.
[01:28:19.441 --> 01:28:21.843]  And again, here's Ventura still fighting.
[01:28:21.843 --> 01:28:25.965]  I mean, he didn't run, but he's supporting you and you supported him successfully for governor.
[01:28:25.965 --> 01:28:31.129]  So you're about 10 points behind both of these clowns with 30... Now, I've seen some polls.
[01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.569]  Is it 30 or is it 34%?
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:47.380]  Uh, the last poll, the one was at 37, the other one was at 34, and I'm sitting around 20 to 21, 22 somewhere in that range with a huge undecided, just a huge, and both my opponents' negatives are well over 50%.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:47.981]  Nobody likes them.
[01:28:49.563 --> 01:28:58.569]  And I just have to get to the other people that are making up their mind right now of who I am, get my message out, because everywhere I go, people hear me talk, I convert them.
[01:28:58.569 --> 01:29:07.114]  But I've only got about a week to go, and this TV campaign is going to be essential for me to actually tip this one and actually win it, just like Jesse did.
[01:29:07.114 --> 01:29:08.855]  And Texas has a great chance.
[01:29:08.855 --> 01:29:11.737]  I mean, I spent a year and a half down there with Kiki Friedman.
[01:29:11.737 --> 01:29:13.558]  I think Austin is my adopted home.
[01:29:13.558 --> 01:29:14.639]  I love Austin.
[01:29:14.639 --> 01:29:16.160]  But here's your chance.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.301]  I'll say Texas will be my adopted state.
[01:29:19.006 --> 01:29:20.928]  This is good for the entire country.
[01:29:20.928 --> 01:29:23.310]  I mean, we need to change this country.
[01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:24.651]  We're on all over.
[01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:30.435]  We're on in Illinois, California, Kansas, Missouri, Florida, New York.
[01:29:30.435 --> 01:29:33.357]  This would be a strike for the entire country.
[01:29:33.357 --> 01:29:35.819]  We know how rotten politics has gotten.
[01:29:35.819 --> 01:29:38.682]  We know how Congress can't get anything done anymore.
[01:29:38.682 --> 01:29:40.083]  Our country's going to hell.
[01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.424]  Senator Dean Barkley, Governor Jesse Ventura, stay there.
[01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:45.467]  We're going to come back and go to both of you and talk about this. $50,000.
[01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:51.670]  He's only 10 points behind the other two stooges with 37% undecided.
[01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:53.070]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:55.571]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.571 --> 01:30:02.113]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.113 --> 01:30:06.295]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[01:30:06.295 --> 01:30:07.415]  Of course not.
[01:30:07.415 --> 01:30:13.357]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:30:13.996 --> 01:30:19.379]  I'm Walt Augustinowicz, founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information you need to know.
[01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:24.583]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards, because they look physically just like the old card.
[01:30:24.583 --> 01:30:34.429]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card possible, right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing the card.
[01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:37.331]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[01:30:37.811 --> 01:30:43.335]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's why we manufacture the SecureSleeve.
[01:30:43.335 --> 01:30:50.061]  The SecureSleeve is a patent-pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier, preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[01:30:50.061 --> 01:30:54.944]  You can get more information and purchase the SecureSleeve online at idstronghold.com.
[01:30:54.944 --> 01:30:58.147]  That's idstronghold.com, or call us at 800-610-2770.
[01:31:01.781 --> 01:31:05.004]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:31:05.004 --> 01:31:08.466]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:08.466 --> 01:31:11.088]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:11.088 --> 01:31:12.670]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.670 --> 01:31:13.470]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:14.331]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:14.331 --> 01:31:15.852]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.852 --> 01:31:17.193]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.793 --> 01:31:24.975]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.975 --> 01:31:25.455]  Some U.S.
[01:31:25.455 --> 01:31:31.796]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.796 --> 01:31:35.297]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:35.297 --> 01:31:45.800]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.500]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:31:54.766 --> 01:31:58.129]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:07.906]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[01:32:07.906 --> 01:32:21.877]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[01:32:21.877 --> 01:32:25.419]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[01:32:25.419 --> 01:32:29.903]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[01:32:30.163 --> 01:32:32.264]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[01:32:32.264 --> 01:32:35.826]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[01:32:35.826 --> 01:32:42.650]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:49.654]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators by going to ioniczone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[01:32:49.654 --> 01:32:51.215]  That's I-O-N-I-C, zone, dot com, or toll free, 800-549-9535.
[01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:09.685]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:09.685 --> 01:33:14.727]  to 3 p.m., 4 hours, Central Standard Time.
[01:33:14.727 --> 01:33:16.007]  That's noon to 4 p.m.
[01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:17.368]  Eastern.
[01:33:17.368 --> 01:33:19.989]  We are here live.
[01:33:19.989 --> 01:33:23.271]  Simulcasting on a growing, wonderful list of AM and FM affiliates.
[01:33:24.793 --> 01:33:33.868]  Going out on three different satellite systems, global, shortwave, and the number one radio talk show on the internet, on free internet shows, if you go to the Shoutcast Ranking.
[01:33:33.868 --> 01:33:36.853]  There's some music above us, but we're the number one radio talk show.
[01:33:36.853 --> 01:33:37.735]  And we are very honored
[01:33:39.019 --> 01:33:47.662]  To have Senator Dean Barclay there for a month, appointed by the governor after Senator Wellstone's tragic death.
[01:33:47.662 --> 01:33:57.105]  And of course, the dark horse candidate that won, and really changed history in the electoral process, Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:33:57.105 --> 01:33:59.425]  Former Governor Jesse Ventura from Minnesota.
[01:33:59.425 --> 01:34:02.026]  Jesse, we were talking during the break, there's another key point.
[01:34:02.026 --> 01:34:07.268]  Not only is 37 to 34 percent undecided, depending on the poll,
[01:34:08.551 --> 01:34:20.039]  And not only were you 10 points behind, just like Dean is, going in a week and a half before the election, but something else happened that parallels this.
[01:34:20.039 --> 01:34:25.563]  I mean, this is key because folks need to understand, Dean Barclay has a big chance of winning if people take action.
[01:34:25.563 --> 01:34:26.043]  Tell them, Governor.
[01:34:26.896 --> 01:34:41.169]  Well, you know, again, across this whole country right now, to me, if you're angry, and you're angry at the situation that our nation is in today, you have only two people, two entities to blame for that.
[01:34:41.169 --> 01:34:43.631]  That is the Democrats and the Republicans.
[01:34:44.191 --> 01:34:48.053]  Because they're the ones that have put our country in the position it's in today.
[01:34:48.053 --> 01:34:57.519]  They're the ones that are trying to get us out with bailouts and all of this other stuff that they're doing for problems that they created and caused.
[01:34:57.519 --> 01:34:59.120]  And we've got to step forward.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.643]  This is an opportunity to shoot a shot that'll be heard around the world.
[01:35:03.783 --> 01:35:04.584]  We're good to go.
[01:35:30.418 --> 01:35:39.061]  Break down the numbers that you were telling me during the break about how more people voted than they had also guesstimated they would.
[01:35:39.061 --> 01:35:46.304]  Well, what happened in Minnesota going into, and Dean's ahead of this, you were talking going into the final weekend.
[01:35:46.304 --> 01:35:50.646]  Going into the final weekend, I was at, I think, 26 or 27% right in there.
[01:35:50.646 --> 01:35:52.387]  And they anticipated a 50% voter turnout.
[01:35:58.289 --> 01:36:09.572]  Well, they didn't anticipate it ended up 60%, and those were the 10% that took me from 27 to 37, and that's how I won.
[01:36:09.572 --> 01:36:15.914]  Well, right now they're predicting it could be as high as an 80% voter turnout, and everyone remember this.
[01:36:16.614 --> 01:36:20.518]  Traditionally, Minnesota leads the nation in voter turnout.
[01:36:20.518 --> 01:36:23.441]  It's always a battle between us and Maine.
[01:36:23.441 --> 01:36:28.427]  And ironically, when I was governor, there was another independent governor.
[01:36:28.427 --> 01:36:31.090]  His name was Governor Angus King of Maine.
[01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:36.111]  And Angus was actually on his second term when I started my first.
[01:36:36.111 --> 01:36:41.853]  I just got a lot more publicity than he did for whatever, I suppose, my background and all of that.
[01:36:41.853 --> 01:36:50.636]  But notice that the states with the largest voter turnouts are the ones where you get a third candidate elected.
[01:36:50.636 --> 01:36:53.697]  Because these two parties do not want you voting.
[01:36:53.697 --> 01:37:00.519]  They tell you that they do, but the reality is they don't because smaller numbers are easier to control.
[01:37:02.834 --> 01:37:05.235]  Absolutely.
[01:37:05.235 --> 01:37:08.637]  Dean, I mean, obviously you're doing a lot of radio interviews every day.
[01:37:08.637 --> 01:37:10.258]  You're doing some TV.
[01:37:10.258 --> 01:37:11.518]  These TV ads are key.
[01:37:11.518 --> 01:37:23.444]  People need to go to SenatorBarclay.com, www.SenatorBarclay.com or just Google Dean Barclay and you'll find his site that way.
[01:37:23.444 --> 01:37:25.165]  Or you can call the
[01:37:26.326 --> 01:37:28.668]  Senator Dean Barkley headquarters at 1-763-417-9972.
[01:37:28.668 --> 01:37:28.748]  1-763-417-9972.
[01:37:28.748 --> 01:37:35.273]  You know, he supported Ron Paul, he broke all those records, woke up tens of millions of people in the New World Order.
[01:37:45.354 --> 01:37:48.316]  But, you know, at the end of the day, he failed there in the big presidential run.
[01:37:48.316 --> 01:37:51.078]  But this is a state run for senator.
[01:37:51.078 --> 01:37:56.423]  This is a battleground that Governor Ventura and Dean Barclay that trailblazed for the governor.
[01:37:56.423 --> 01:38:03.029]  This is a chance for the American people to send a message that we are sick and tired of both parties.
[01:38:03.029 --> 01:38:03.729]  So here's that number 763-417-9999.
[01:38:07.627 --> 01:38:10.310]  And Alex, if I can throw in there, remember, in Dean and I's candidacies,
[01:38:19.873 --> 01:38:25.935]  Most of our contributions are $50 and $100, $20, $25.
[01:38:25.935 --> 01:38:30.657]  We welcome that because we don't spend like these other two parties do.
[01:38:30.657 --> 01:38:34.318]  We don't win elections by money, we win them with ideas.
[01:38:34.318 --> 01:38:39.140]  But certainly you have to have some money in which to get your ideas out there.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:42.962]  Well, the mainstream media is even admitting the public is close to physical revolution.
[01:38:42.962 --> 01:38:46.463]  Police are saying they're getting ready for riots after the elections.
[01:39:03.071 --> 01:39:05.832]  There's open talk of martial law in Congress.
[01:39:05.832 --> 01:39:08.333]  Third parties are only going to get stronger and stronger.
[01:39:08.333 --> 01:39:10.914]  Independent parties are only going to get stronger and stronger.
[01:39:10.914 --> 01:39:16.015]  But if we have this loser attitude and decide that we can't take action, they're going to win.
[01:39:16.015 --> 01:39:17.496]  And Governor Ventura, while you were here,
[01:39:19.798 --> 01:39:21.318]  And then we're going to go to Senator Barkley.
[01:39:21.318 --> 01:39:42.365]  You eloquently spoke to the fact that what's killing us is that Americans have been voting like it's a horse race for the horse they think is going to win, or, you know, kind of like these fans who get on the bandwagon for a football team once it's assured they're going to win, instead of ideas, and then that allows the corporate-controlled media to dominate and only show the two parties.
[01:39:42.365 --> 01:39:43.745]  Can you say that in your own words?
[01:39:44.577 --> 01:39:47.998]  Well, for me, it's vote your heart and conscience.
[01:39:47.998 --> 01:39:49.678]  It's as simple as that.
[01:39:49.678 --> 01:39:56.480]  Don't go into that election booth thinking, well, everyone's voting for so-and-so, so I want to be on the winning side.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.600]  That's the wrong attitude to take.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:11.543]  Go into that booth and pick out the person that you most want to do that job, and if you vote your heart and your conscience, you can walk out of that booth with your head held high, knowing that you're a patriotic American.
[01:40:11.983 --> 01:40:15.947]  And that you're doing what our forefathers had in mind to begin with.
[01:40:15.947 --> 01:40:17.428]  You know, let's remember something.
[01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:23.234]  They didn't have in mind career politicians way back in the day when they formed our country.
[01:40:23.234 --> 01:40:26.958]  They didn't believe people would go out and make a career of getting elected.
[01:40:27.598 --> 01:40:32.242]  They believe that you'd come from the private sector, you'd go serve, and then imagine.
[01:40:32.242 --> 01:40:38.947]  When you're done, go back to what you used to do, or go on to a new career in the private sector, is what I usually do.
[01:40:38.947 --> 01:40:47.633]  But again, this is an opportunity, Alex, for America, for all the angry people out there, to strike out and send a message.
[01:40:47.633 --> 01:40:50.135]  Send an independent senator to Washington.
[01:40:50.135 --> 01:40:53.057]  That'll shake them up more than anything they can imagine.
[01:40:54.837 --> 01:40:58.018]  www.senatorbarkley.com.
[01:40:58.018 --> 01:41:02.159]  Barkley is B-A-R-K-L-E-Y.
[01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:06.480]  We're going to get links up later today up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:12.982]  I want to get one of our writers to do a story about this and this important campaign.
[01:41:12.982 --> 01:41:15.363]  How much attention have you been getting, Senator Barkley?
[01:41:16.297 --> 01:41:17.338]  I've been getting attention.
[01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:18.419]  It's unbelievable.
[01:41:18.419 --> 01:41:19.720]  I mean, it's been non-stop.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.022]  I've been going all over the state of Minnesota.
[01:41:22.022 --> 01:41:25.426]  I just got a major endorsement from one of the major papers up at St.
[01:41:25.426 --> 01:41:26.186]  Cloud.
[01:41:26.186 --> 01:41:27.347]  I couldn't have written a better one.
[01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:36.936]  Like I say, everyone who hears me speak and talk about my vision of where this country needs to go and the problems we're facing and how bad things have gotten.
[01:41:36.936 --> 01:41:39.139]  We just need to quit these bad habits.
[01:41:39.887 --> 01:41:47.511]  You know, Ben Franklin said it very well when he said, you know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.
[01:41:47.511 --> 01:41:49.872]  This country's got to change its direction.
[01:41:49.872 --> 01:41:51.252]  And this could be the first step.
[01:41:51.252 --> 01:41:54.234]  I mean, you can have a revolution in this country by voting the right way.
[01:41:54.790 --> 01:42:05.278]  I mean, you know, if you like what you got, well fine, pick the Democratic or Republican, but if you want someone who's going to change the direction this country's heading, like Ron Paul wanted to do, here's your chance.
[01:42:05.278 --> 01:42:06.739]  This would be the first step.
[01:42:06.739 --> 01:42:11.562]  This wouldn't just be for Minnesota, this is for the entire country to say, hey, we've had it.
[01:42:12.779 --> 01:42:18.565]  You know, quit doing what you're doing and start solving these problems and quit fighting or you're going to lose your job.
[01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:23.690]  And I guarantee the only thing that Democrats and Republicans pay attention to is power.
[01:42:23.690 --> 01:42:31.718]  And until we start sending people to Washington that consider themselves to be Americans first and members of a political party second, nothing's going to ever change.
[01:42:31.718 --> 01:42:33.000]  So this could be the first step.
[01:42:35.308 --> 01:42:37.969]  Absolutely, Senator.
[01:42:37.969 --> 01:42:40.370]  I couldn't say it more eloquently myself.
[01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:41.770]  You're ready for the job.
[01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:45.111]  I give you my stamp of approval.
[01:42:45.111 --> 01:42:46.192]  No, I'm ready for it, too.
[01:42:46.192 --> 01:42:48.433]  I mean, we've got a lot of work to do in this country.
[01:42:48.433 --> 01:42:51.194]  We can do anything we want if we just set our mind to it.
[01:42:51.194 --> 01:42:57.916]  These problems can all be solved at the end of the world, but we've got to change the system that's destroying us.
[01:42:57.916 --> 01:43:01.057]  How much more are we going to take before we're going to wake up and start voting the right way?
[01:43:02.122 --> 01:43:04.423]  Well, I mean, it's good news that folks are upset.
[01:43:04.423 --> 01:43:06.664]  We're getting record voter turnout.
[01:43:06.664 --> 01:43:09.165]  And it's a process of them fully waking up.
[01:43:09.165 --> 01:43:11.706]  So at first, they just disengaged from the system.
[01:43:11.706 --> 01:43:16.548]  Now they're coming back to it in droves and they're going to find out, like Ventura said, the governor, that it's a fraud.
[01:43:16.548 --> 01:43:19.209]  Then they're going to come to the third parties, to the independents.
[01:43:19.209 --> 01:43:20.709]  That's already happening.
[01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:23.410]  And so this wave is only building now.
[01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:24.831]  And people have no excuse.
[01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:26.752]  They can't just sit there and suck their thumbs.
[01:43:26.752 --> 01:43:28.533]  No matter where you live in the United States, if you're a U.S.
[01:43:28.533 --> 01:43:29.573]  citizen, you can donate.
[01:43:30.718 --> 01:43:47.107]  I am going to go online today, and I'm going to donate money to the Barclay campaign, and I think everybody out there should do it, because, you know, this is a good shot we've got here to have somebody with a bully pulpit, somebody who can be a swing vote, you know, an independent, even in the House is a big deal.
[01:43:47.107 --> 01:43:49.608]  And a lot of attention gets paid to them.
[01:43:49.608 --> 01:43:54.370]  In the Senate, this will be just a huge deal, and it's...
[01:43:56.284 --> 01:44:13.148]  So important that people get involved right now, because we've got, what, eight, nine days, this money will come in, this ad package being produced, done by tomorrow, ready to hit TV, you know, that punch right to the nose, like Jesse Ventura said, we need to get you elected, Senator Barkley.
[01:44:13.148 --> 01:44:15.569]  So again, 763-417-9972 is the number for the campaign office, 763-417-9972.
[01:44:15.569 --> 01:44:16.789]  Well, I've got some good news, too.
[01:44:16.789 --> 01:44:17.889]  Our website is being swamped right now.
[01:44:24.418 --> 01:44:27.802]  And so if people can't get through, or if we crash, we'll be back up.
[01:44:27.802 --> 01:44:36.112]  So don't give up if you can't get through, because right now my webmaster is telling me we're just being inundated now with support, and I thank you for doing it.
[01:44:36.112 --> 01:44:42.420]  Well, Alex, you're a man of your word, because you told me that yesterday, what would happen.
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:43.802]  Well, I know how great my listeners are.
[01:44:44.674 --> 01:44:46.296]  No kidding.
[01:44:46.296 --> 01:44:49.959]  You're tapped right into your listeners and I'm so happy.
[01:44:49.959 --> 01:44:52.341]  I mean, this is outstanding.
[01:44:52.341 --> 01:44:54.643]  Well, you've got some true Americans out there now.
[01:44:54.643 --> 01:44:56.785]  We can't take this country back, but we have to start.
[01:44:57.870 --> 01:45:02.712]  Well, folks, if the site does completely crash, we have millions of listeners.
[01:45:02.712 --> 01:45:05.893]  The key here is the phone number 763-417-9972.
[01:45:05.893 --> 01:45:13.495]  And, Senator, I do hope you have quite a few people there to answer the phones because they'll get calls.
[01:45:13.495 --> 01:45:16.396]  I mean, different stations air this throughout the day and throughout the night.
[01:45:16.936 --> 01:45:20.277]  And then some in the morning, so you're going to get calls for the next 24 hours.
[01:45:20.277 --> 01:45:26.440]  Right, and we can take credit card information right over the phone and then do a donation that way so we can get it in time for the TV spots.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:35.583]  Hey, listen, the reason I'm behind you is I've seen your stances, your policies, very close to Ron Paul, very close to what Ventura stood for as well, and I know you were a trailblazer.
[01:45:35.583 --> 01:45:38.244]  I know you've already been to the Senate as an appointment for a month.
[01:45:38.844 --> 01:45:41.405]  And so it's just right to send you there instead of the other guys.
[01:45:41.405 --> 01:45:43.626]  I mean, the other guys are total jokers.
[01:45:43.626 --> 01:45:45.767]  You know, one of them's a total establishment insider.
[01:45:45.767 --> 01:45:54.750]  Franken's basically a socialist who didn't even really live in Minnesota, been in New York, you know, doesn't even have a Minnesota driver's license until he got back.
[01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:56.711]  And you know, you're there.
[01:45:56.711 --> 01:45:57.351]  You're there fighting.
[01:45:57.351 --> 01:45:58.752]  You helped get Ventura elected.
[01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:02.255]  You know, you've paid your dues.
[01:46:02.255 --> 01:46:04.837]  You know, you've made your bones in this fight.
[01:46:04.837 --> 01:46:07.899]  And regardless of whether you win, lose, or draw, we're taking action.
[01:46:07.899 --> 01:46:08.859]  We're not sitting on our butt.
[01:46:08.859 --> 01:46:12.382]  Look, when I asked Ventura, you know, when Willie invited, he said, hey, I have Ventura down.
[01:46:12.782 --> 01:46:19.306]  You know, I mean, Ventura Cain, you know, he's a go-getter taking action while he's shooting, you know, all these pilots for TV and all this other stuff.
[01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:22.608]  He came down here just because we asked him to come down here.
[01:46:22.608 --> 01:46:29.112]  And so that's why, also, I mean, a lot of life is just taking action, folks, and not sitting there on your butt questioning.
[01:46:29.112 --> 01:46:31.373]  A lot of people want to do it perfect, or they want a silver bullet.
[01:46:31.933 --> 01:46:36.415]  Or they want to have some, you know, magic master plan given to them to fix things.
[01:46:36.415 --> 01:46:43.437]  A lot of it is just getting up off our butts and taking action with the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and just throwing ourselves against the machine.
[01:46:43.437 --> 01:46:46.158]  Governor Ventura?
[01:46:46.158 --> 01:46:47.598]  Yes, Alex.
[01:46:47.598 --> 01:46:50.179]  I mean, can you speak to just taking action?
[01:46:50.179 --> 01:46:56.301]  Well, you know, it's a case of if, you know, if not you, then who?
[01:46:56.301 --> 01:47:00.022]  If you sit back and wait for everybody else to do it, nothing's going to happen.
[01:47:00.728 --> 01:47:09.455]  But if you step forward, and it requires all of us in our own way, in our own small way, this is the greatest country in the world.
[01:47:09.455 --> 01:47:12.117]  Without a doubt.
[01:47:12.117 --> 01:47:13.658]  But it may not be.
[01:47:13.658 --> 01:47:19.823]  The direction that we're heading now, we are not going in the direction of being the greatest country in the world.
[01:47:19.823 --> 01:47:22.365]  But we don't need to let that happen.
[01:47:22.365 --> 01:47:24.227]  And it's all our choice.
[01:47:24.227 --> 01:47:27.769]  We can bitch, we can complain, we can do all of those things.
[01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:31.372]  But, truthfully, you've got to be people of action.
[01:47:31.372 --> 01:47:34.154]  You've got to step forward, do what you can do.
[01:47:34.154 --> 01:47:41.378]  I mean, if it's only $10, hey, if that's all you can afford to send to a campaign, that's enough.
[01:47:41.378 --> 01:47:46.661]  Or if you've got family in Minnesota, you're from Minnesota, call all your friends and family.
[01:47:46.661 --> 01:47:52.605]  Get up off your butt, call 15, 20, 30 people and tell them, vote for Senator Dean Barclay.
[01:47:52.605 --> 01:47:57.008]  Vote for Dean Barclay and tell them, SenatorBarclay.com, www.SenatorBarclay.com.
[01:47:58.616 --> 01:48:00.017]  SenatorBarclay.com.
[01:48:00.017 --> 01:48:01.277]  I mean, that is powerful.
[01:48:01.277 --> 01:48:06.700]  People in Minnesota, I know Ted's given to the campaign, the owner of Genesis based up there in Burnsville.
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:09.281]  That's what it's all about here.
[01:48:09.281 --> 01:48:17.585]  But, you know, in the final equation, there is a sleeping giant that's rising and the people are beginning to resist.
[01:48:17.585 --> 01:48:26.829]  Senator Barclay, Ron Paul on this radio show has called for criminal indictments by grand jury at the state level of Paulson, of Fed,
[01:48:28.769 --> 01:48:37.792]  Secretary of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, what would you do about this bailout and all the corruption we see if you were able to get into the Senate?
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.920]  Well, I think we're going to put an end to it.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.421]  You know, I found out a simple fact a couple days ago.
[01:48:42.421 --> 01:48:50.804]  Do you know that these same Wall Street banks that just got bailed out are projecting to spend over $70 billion in bonuses by the end of the year?
[01:48:50.804 --> 01:48:52.344]  I mean, what gives here?
[01:48:52.344 --> 01:48:53.685]  I mean, this is insanity.
[01:48:53.685 --> 01:48:55.505]  We should have an investigation.
[01:48:55.505 --> 01:48:59.307]  If I'm in the Senate, I'll try to get in the clinic and investigate what happened here.
[01:48:59.307 --> 01:49:00.247]  What really happened?
[01:49:00.854 --> 01:49:02.375]  Uh, who was asleep at the switch?
[01:49:02.375 --> 01:49:05.256]  I think there should be some heads to roll here.
[01:49:05.256 --> 01:49:11.137]  And my God, if you're running for re-election after you were in charge of all this happened, why in the world would you ever re-elect someone?
[01:49:11.137 --> 01:49:14.038]  If they'd been on the board of directors, they'd be indicted right now.
[01:49:14.038 --> 01:49:15.539]  Not seeking re-election.
[01:49:15.919 --> 01:49:22.726]  I mean, it's just incredible the amount of mismanagement that we've seen the last 10 years in Congress.
[01:49:22.726 --> 01:49:25.488]  It's time for people to, like I said, here's their chance.
[01:49:25.488 --> 01:49:26.409]  Send me there.
[01:49:26.409 --> 01:49:28.832]  I will make a ruckus, I promise you.
[01:49:28.832 --> 01:49:31.034]  I haven't taken one dime from Wall Street.
[01:49:31.034 --> 01:49:38.421]  You know, Norm Coleman, one of my opponents, has taken $3 million from the banking sector alone, and he's going to go back and fix this?
[01:49:38.421 --> 01:49:39.182]  Give me a break.
[01:49:39.582 --> 01:49:40.643]  What would you do about Dean?
[01:49:40.643 --> 01:49:43.426]  You know what else is interesting about him too, Dean?
[01:49:43.426 --> 01:49:46.549]  Our illustrious current senator?
[01:49:46.549 --> 01:49:48.772]  He's supposed to be a Republican, right?
[01:49:48.772 --> 01:49:52.235]  That stands for private business and all of that.
[01:49:52.235 --> 01:49:58.161]  This guy has been cashing government checks for 32 years.
[01:49:58.161 --> 01:49:59.683]  He's never worked for the private sector.
[01:50:00.333 --> 01:50:04.678]  He has not worked in the private sector in 32 years.
[01:50:04.678 --> 01:50:06.480]  It's time to move him in.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:14.168]  It's time for him to live those ads he has on TV where he tells all of us that he feels our pain.
[01:50:14.168 --> 01:50:19.794]  Well, how could he possibly feel our pain when he's cashing a government check for 32 straight years?
[01:50:19.794 --> 01:50:21.896]  Yeah, it's time to put him out to pasture.
[01:50:21.896 --> 01:50:22.437]  That's right.
[01:50:24.128 --> 01:50:25.149]  Unbelievable.
[01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:32.975]  Let us find out what a real job is like, where you might have to actually go out and earn a living, which all of us have to do.
[01:50:32.975 --> 01:50:36.978]  When we get back, we're going to ask Senator Dean Barclay.
[01:50:36.978 --> 01:50:38.979]  He was there for a month, appointed by Ventura.
[01:50:38.979 --> 01:50:40.921]  In a close race, he can win.
[01:50:40.921 --> 01:50:41.741]  SenatorBarclay.com.
[01:50:41.741 --> 01:50:44.683]  We're going to ask him what he would do on the Iraq War.
[01:50:44.683 --> 01:50:46.244]  What his plan for that is.
[01:50:46.244 --> 01:50:47.145]  A senator can do a lot.
[01:50:47.145 --> 01:50:48.746]  Have a lot of press conferences.
[01:50:48.746 --> 01:50:50.408]  Raise a lot of ruckus.
[01:50:50.408 --> 01:50:51.288]  Very, very powerful.
[01:50:51.288 --> 01:50:52.069]  We need to get him in there.
[01:50:53.012 --> 01:50:55.273]  That's why we're spending time on this today.
[01:50:55.273 --> 01:50:56.833]  SenatorBarclay.com.
[01:50:56.833 --> 01:51:02.095]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.095 --> 01:51:05.556]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:51:05.556 --> 01:51:09.798]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:51:09.798 --> 01:51:21.222]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:51:21.462 --> 01:51:32.227]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:51:32.227 --> 01:51:40.432]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:51:40.432 --> 01:51:47.295]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and
[01:51:47.295 --> 01:51:52.857]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:52:10.026 --> 01:52:11.367]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:11.367 --> 01:52:17.712]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:18.408 --> 01:52:27.295]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:27.295 --> 01:52:34.400]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.442]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:37.442 --> 01:52:43.347]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:43.347 --> 01:52:45.929]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:46.409 --> 01:52:52.335]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:52:52.335 --> 01:52:55.398]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:52:55.398 --> 01:53:00.303]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:01.946 --> 01:53:07.814]  You invest, you buy insurance, you wear your seatbelt, you do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:08.655]  But why?
[01:53:08.655 --> 01:53:09.917]  Just in case?
[01:53:09.917 --> 01:53:13.001]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?
[01:53:13.001 --> 01:53:15.624]  Preparation starts at survivalgearsource.com.

[01:53:42.681 --> 01:53:44.082]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[01:54:07.554 --> 01:54:09.655]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:38.019 --> 01:54:40.562]  We are talking to former Governor Jesse Ventura, also.
[01:54:40.562 --> 01:54:43.466]  He's in two of my favorite movies, Predator and The Running Man.
[01:54:43.466 --> 01:54:49.993]  I remember being a little kid, man, and liking Ventura more than Schwarzenegger on those shows.
[01:54:49.993 --> 01:54:51.075]  Just the character, man.
[01:54:51.075 --> 01:54:51.976]  He's great on screen.
[01:54:53.217 --> 01:55:10.446]  Uh, and uh, but then all the other things he's done, Navy SEAL, he was even a rock star, even got on the charts with Warner, you know, in a big CD, and he's done so much, and of course Governor of Minnesota, and we've got Senator Dean Barclay, who I'm going to keep a few minutes to the next hour so he can actually, you know, go through his platform.
[01:55:10.446 --> 01:55:19.411]  He's anti-New World Order, he's anti-war, and we're going to talk about that, but just give us the brief take on it before we say bye to Ventura, Senator Barclay.
[01:55:20.308 --> 01:55:23.711]  On the Iraq War, I mean, it's the biggest mistake since Vietnam.
[01:55:23.711 --> 01:55:25.132]  We were lied to in Vietnam.
[01:55:25.132 --> 01:55:27.273]  We were lied to in this war.
[01:55:27.273 --> 01:55:34.678]  We've now spent five and a half years, over $600 billion that we don't have, and over 4,300 American lives have been lost.
[01:55:34.678 --> 01:55:36.099]  It's time to get out of that war.
[01:55:36.099 --> 01:55:42.564]  I won't vote for a single spending bill authorizing that war without a firm timetable.
[01:55:42.564 --> 01:55:48.448]  I think we can get out within six months, and we have to get out of there and let Iraq determine its own future now.
[01:55:48.448 --> 01:55:49.729]  What about the New World Order?
[01:55:50.794 --> 01:55:58.257]  Oh my God, I mean, you know, we spend more on our military budget right now than all the other military budgets combined in the world.
[01:55:58.257 --> 01:56:00.278]  And I'm still waiting for the peace dividend.
[01:56:00.278 --> 01:56:02.079]  20 years ago, we ended the Cold War.
[01:56:02.079 --> 01:56:04.020]  It's insane what we're doing.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:11.103]  $11 trillion in debt, and we want to be the world's policeman in this new world order about world government and giving up our sovereignty.
[01:56:11.103 --> 01:56:13.304]  You know, we've got to put a stop to this insanity.
[01:56:13.424 --> 01:56:18.849]  We're going to talk more about that with you, Senator, when I keep you for five more minutes or longer, if you like, on the other side.
[01:56:18.849 --> 01:56:22.132]  But in closing, we've got about three minutes left here in this hour.
[01:56:22.132 --> 01:56:25.074]  Governor Ventura, again, it was great having you down here in Austin.
[01:56:25.074 --> 01:56:28.998]  You're even more amazing when you get to spend a few days with you, not just a little while.
[01:56:28.998 --> 01:56:32.601]  Your closing comments on Senator Barclay and what we're doing here.
[01:56:33.381 --> 01:56:37.464]  Well, again, Alex, thank you very much for giving us the time today.
[01:56:37.464 --> 01:56:41.848]  You're a patriot also in what you do, and a great American.
[01:56:41.848 --> 01:56:51.795]  And you're out there every day on the battle line talking what you're talking, and you've got to keep it up, because always remember, our First Amendment rights are always in jeopardy.
[01:56:51.795 --> 01:56:57.439]  They're always trying to shut people up, and they don't want people talking about things that make them uncomfortable, Alex.
[01:56:57.959 --> 01:56:59.640]  And you're a person that gets out there.
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:00.881]  You've got courage.
[01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:03.662]  You talk about the stuff that makes them uncomfortable.
[01:57:03.662 --> 01:57:05.724]  So you keep up the good work, too.
[01:57:05.724 --> 01:57:08.285]  And I have all the faith in the world in your listeners.
[01:57:08.285 --> 01:57:10.086]  I think we're going to step forward.
[01:57:10.086 --> 01:57:12.167]  We're going to get Senator Barclay elected.
[01:57:12.167 --> 01:57:15.549]  And they're going to hear a shot heard around the world again, just like in 98.
[01:57:17.070 --> 01:57:22.491]  In fact, it could be, you know, I'm heading off to work on my surfing down in Mexico.
[01:57:22.491 --> 01:57:25.152]  That's the thing I'm trying to conquer next is the waves.
[01:57:25.152 --> 01:57:35.794]  And I'll tell you what, knowing that Dean Barclays is going to be in Washington, I'll surf a lot better and I'll enjoy those waves much more when I come back in the spring.
[01:57:35.794 --> 01:57:36.454]  Oh my God.
[01:57:36.454 --> 01:57:38.975]  And while you're at it, you're helping GM redesign the Hummer.
[01:57:41.086 --> 01:57:43.048]  Well, I don't know about that.
[01:57:43.048 --> 01:57:45.390]  I can sure go down there and blow them up now and then.
[01:57:52.342 --> 01:57:54.183]  Anyway, Alex, I'm going to run.
[01:57:54.183 --> 01:57:55.704]  Take care of Senator Barclay.
[01:57:55.704 --> 01:57:56.224]  Good luck.
[01:57:56.224 --> 01:57:59.426]  We'll keep pounding out there next Tuesday.
[01:57:59.426 --> 01:58:04.508]  We're going to send an independent to Washington and scare the hell out of them.
[01:58:04.508 --> 01:58:05.408]  Thank you, Jesse.
[01:58:05.408 --> 01:58:06.589]  Jesse, one last question.
[01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:07.910]  We're talking during the break.
[01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:10.211]  I'm exhausted today with three hours sleep.
[01:58:10.211 --> 01:58:13.152]  You were telling me that sometimes you don't even sleep.
[01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:18.975]  No, well, you know, remember when you go through Navy SEAL training, they keep you awake for a week so you get used to it.
[01:58:20.304 --> 01:58:24.187]  Yeah, I mean, you had so much energy this morning at 5.45 when I picked you up.
[01:58:24.187 --> 01:58:25.268]  You were like a jumping jack.
[01:58:25.268 --> 01:58:28.050]  And me, I was like driving down the road, falling asleep.
[01:58:28.050 --> 01:58:30.712]  Governor, it was a great adventure having you down here, and we love you.
[01:58:30.712 --> 01:58:31.473]  Take care.
[01:58:31.473 --> 01:58:32.133]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:32.133 --> 01:58:34.135]  Same to you, and we'll see you in Dallas.
[01:58:34.135 --> 01:58:34.395]  Hopefully.
[01:58:34.395 --> 01:58:34.795]  Bye-bye.
[01:58:34.795 --> 01:58:35.316]  That's right.
[01:58:35.316 --> 01:58:37.157]  We'll talk about that later.
[01:58:37.157 --> 01:58:38.278]  A little secret.
[01:58:38.278 --> 01:58:39.699]  Alright, we'll be right back with the Senator.
[01:58:39.699 --> 01:58:43.061]  Stay with us.

[01:58:51.869 --> 01:58:58.637]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.637 --> 01:59:01.280]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:02.822]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:02.822 --> 01:59:03.623]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:03.623 --> 01:59:04.584]  This is his ammo.
[01:59:04.584 --> 01:59:06.006]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:06.006 --> 01:59:07.568]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:07.968 --> 01:59:15.137]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:15.137 --> 01:59:15.597]  Some U.S.
[01:59:15.597 --> 01:59:21.965]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:21.965 --> 01:59:25.429]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:25.649 --> 01:59:35.935]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:35.935 --> 01:59:37.155]  Fabled enemies.

[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:48.262]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:54.384 --> 01:59:56.786]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.786 --> 02:00:06.071]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.071 --> 02:00:07.392]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.392 --> 02:00:09.153]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.153 --> 02:00:10.895]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.895 --> 02:00:12.496]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.496 --> 02:00:13.376]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.376 --> 02:00:18.239]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.239 --> 02:00:22.362]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.737 --> 02:00:27.680]  The more I learn about this Gene Barkley, the more I like him.
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:31.483]  Anti-New World Order, anti-global government.
[02:00:31.483 --> 02:00:33.284]  Get us out of the war, day one.
[02:00:33.284 --> 02:00:39.469]  Try to arrest the bankers, end the bailout, banker takeover.
[02:00:39.469 --> 02:00:45.553]  And, uh, I got home last night, I like won, I went and Googled him, and I'd heard about him, and Ted had told me I ought to have him on last week.
[02:00:45.553 --> 02:00:47.495]  He recommended it, I just never got around to it.
[02:00:47.495 --> 02:00:52.478]  He told me how great he was, and part of the, you know, at the Ron Paul Liberty meeting and everything.
[02:00:52.478 --> 02:00:52.959]  And, uh,
[02:00:53.706 --> 02:00:56.787]  And I went and pulled up that he was, you know, that 34% are undecided.
[02:00:56.787 --> 02:00:59.707]  He was talking about 37% undecided.
[02:00:59.707 --> 02:01:01.888]  The good chance he's got a winning and people take action.
[02:01:01.888 --> 02:01:04.628]  I just wish I'd have known about this months ago.
[02:01:04.628 --> 02:01:08.629]  But Ventura's been so busy shooting three different pilots that I haven't talked to him much.
[02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:13.170]  And there's so much going on to even focus on Minnesota politics, but that's national because it's a senator.
[02:01:13.170 --> 02:01:15.271]  So we're going to keep him with us for another 20 minutes.
[02:01:15.271 --> 02:01:16.471]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[02:01:16.471 --> 02:01:17.571]  And you know, I don't screen calls here.
[02:01:18.231 --> 02:01:22.256]  But specifically, when we have a special guest on a certain issue, you can only call in on that issue.
[02:01:22.256 --> 02:01:23.958]  And we do that about once a week or so.
[02:01:23.958 --> 02:01:25.099]  Maybe every two weeks.
[02:01:25.099 --> 02:01:25.700]  Not very often.
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:27.662]  The point is, only for Senator Barkley.
[02:01:27.662 --> 02:01:30.205]  And you can ask him about any of his policies or bring up any issues with that.
[02:01:30.205 --> 02:01:30.585]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:30.585 --> 02:01:30.625]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:36.112 --> 02:01:41.621]  He was a Senator appointed by Governor Ventura when Wellstone died for a month, so that's why he has the title Senator.
[02:01:41.621 --> 02:01:43.223]  We want to send him there officially.
[02:01:43.223 --> 02:01:45.467]  Okay, we got about three minutes until we break in this quick segment.
[02:01:45.467 --> 02:01:46.970]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[02:01:46.970 --> 02:01:49.434]  Tell us about your platform, Senator Dean Barclay.
[02:01:50.273 --> 02:01:52.033]  Well, my platform is pretty simple.
[02:01:52.033 --> 02:01:53.814]  I'm a fiscal conservative.
[02:01:53.814 --> 02:01:58.195]  I think that our country is going down the tube with an $11 trillion debt.
[02:01:58.195 --> 02:02:01.036]  How much more are we going to put in our... It's not our kids anymore.
[02:02:01.036 --> 02:02:02.156]  Now it's our grandchildren.
[02:02:02.156 --> 02:02:04.377]  We're going to settle with this atrocious debt.
[02:02:04.377 --> 02:02:08.318]  We've got our economy now based upon the goodwill of China to buy our bonds.
[02:02:08.318 --> 02:02:12.959]  What would Thomas Jefferson think that our whole economy now is based on China buying bonds?
[02:02:12.959 --> 02:02:16.820]  I mean, the position that they put ourselves in is just incredible.
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:17.860]  I mean, I can't believe it.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:20.461]  But I'm a social... I'm a social moderate.
[02:02:20.461 --> 02:02:23.262]  I believe the government should stay out of our personal life, too.
[02:02:23.262 --> 02:02:27.524]  You know, you have the right to be stupid, and as long as you aren't hurting anyone else, you know, leave us alone.
[02:02:27.524 --> 02:02:33.427]  So I guess I'm the true conservative on both the social issues and the spending issues.
[02:02:33.427 --> 02:02:34.427]  What would you call that?
[02:02:34.427 --> 02:02:36.708]  Kind of a little L libertarian?
[02:02:36.708 --> 02:02:39.009]  Yeah, I'd say a little L libertarian.
[02:02:39.009 --> 02:02:42.190]  I score very well on the libertarian test.
[02:02:42.190 --> 02:02:43.531]  We have a libertarian party here.
[02:02:44.142 --> 02:02:49.607]  I think that we have to do a little bit more than just build roads and protect our borders, but not much.
[02:02:49.607 --> 02:02:51.168]  I think we need a limited government.
[02:02:51.168 --> 02:02:52.389]  We need a smaller government.
[02:02:52.389 --> 02:02:54.210]  Our government is too large.
[02:02:54.210 --> 02:03:00.235]  And we know we're going to have to start having the debate of... You know, we're $11 trillion in debt, folks.
[02:03:00.235 --> 02:03:05.360]  I mean, we have to start having the debate of what we can stop doing, not new things we're going to do for people.
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:06.961]  How are you on the Second Amendment?
[02:03:06.961 --> 02:03:11.725]  How are you on the... What's your... I call the Second Amendment the ultimate guardian of all the others.
[02:03:13.797 --> 02:03:18.459]  And so you're for Vermont-style carry nationwide?
[02:03:18.459 --> 02:03:23.361]  I think people, I mean, thank God the Supreme Court said it's just not to protect our hunting rights.
[02:03:23.361 --> 02:03:40.329]  Everyone in this country has the right to carry arms, and yes, we have to make sure that convicted felons and mentally ill people do not get their hands on them, but beyond that, no, that's our right to have, and we can collect guns, we can have as many guns, not the type, but the government shouldn't say what kind of guns you can have.
[02:03:40.329 --> 02:03:42.470]  We have the right to carry arms.
[02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.710]  We do.
[02:03:43.297 --> 02:03:47.799]  And that was a right given to us, and we've got to protect it as strong as the First Amendment.
[02:03:47.799 --> 02:03:51.000]  So you'd repeal a lot of the federal gun laws as a senator?
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.060]  You'd try that?
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:53.821]  Yes.
[02:03:53.821 --> 02:03:54.561]  That's exciting.
[02:03:54.561 --> 02:03:55.261]  Continue.
[02:03:55.261 --> 02:04:00.843]  Where do you stand on... I mean, we'll be specifically on the war.
[02:04:00.843 --> 02:04:03.344]  What would your plan be to get us out of there?
[02:04:03.344 --> 02:04:07.946]  Well, one thing is that, you know, that Congress has the ability to end that war by stopping the funding.
[02:04:08.396 --> 02:04:11.298]  I mean, they're the ones that have to put the funding bills in.
[02:04:11.298 --> 02:04:17.501]  I would not vote for one new spending authorization for Iraq without a firm-tied table for withdrawal.
[02:04:17.501 --> 02:04:19.622]  Now, everyone wants us out of Iraq.
[02:04:19.622 --> 02:04:21.603]  Even the Iraqi government wants us out.
[02:04:21.603 --> 02:04:23.224]  The only one dragging their feet is Bush.
[02:04:23.948 --> 02:04:30.434]  And it's time to sit down and say, okay, how much time does it really take to safely get our troops out of there?
[02:04:30.434 --> 02:04:36.300]  I think if we could do it within six months to a year, the very most, is to get our troops out of that country.
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:37.421]  We never should have been there.
[02:04:37.421 --> 02:04:38.742]  We've done enough.
[02:04:38.742 --> 02:04:43.006]  I don't want to lose one more American soldier to that battle anymore.
[02:04:43.006 --> 02:04:44.107]  We've done our part.
[02:04:44.107 --> 02:04:45.789]  We put that country back together.
[02:04:46.289 --> 02:04:49.174]  Now it's time for them to determine what they want for themselves.
[02:04:49.174 --> 02:04:50.437]  We believe in self-determination.
[02:04:50.437 --> 02:04:57.189]  But the bankers are making hundreds of billions a year in no-bid weapons contracts and $15 million blue $5 tarps.
[02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:58.871]  We'll be right back with Senator Dean Barkley.
[02:05:01.989 --> 02:05:05.953]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.
[02:05:05.953 --> 02:05:14.340]  AlkaVision GreenShield Green Drink is a specifically formulated nutritional supplement, which provides many nutritional elements that are missing from our modern diet.
[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:18.603]  GreenShield helps neutralize acid in your body and maintains a healthy pH balance.
[02:05:18.603 --> 02:05:22.927]  And having the proper pH balance has been known to balance blood sugar levels.
[02:05:22.927 --> 02:05:24.288]  Something we can all benefit from.
[02:05:24.588 --> 02:05:30.272]  Green Shield combines the perfect blend of powerful whole food vegetables, immune-boosting herbs and grasses.
[02:05:30.272 --> 02:05:36.036]  Green Shield does not contain algae, mushrooms or fungi, has no preservatives, artificial colors or flavors.
[02:05:36.036 --> 02:05:38.898]  The powder mixes easily with water and tastes great.
[02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:44.661]  Drinking Green Shield strengthens the immune system and boosts energy, relieves fatigue and stress without the use of stimulants.
[02:05:55.409 --> 02:05:58.170]  It is a big idea.
[02:05:58.170 --> 02:05:59.471]  A new world order.
[02:05:59.471 --> 02:06:08.295]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:06:08.295 --> 02:06:14.198]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:14.198 --> 02:06:17.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.401]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:27.490]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:06:30.504 --> 02:06:35.968]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:06:35.968 --> 02:06:39.830]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:42.392]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:06:42.392 --> 02:06:43.553]  Most people have no idea.
[02:06:43.553 --> 02:06:44.333]  They're not after money.
[02:06:44.333 --> 02:06:45.634]  They have all the money they need.
[02:06:45.634 --> 02:06:46.595]  They're after power.
[02:06:46.595 --> 02:06:47.756]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:06:59.283 --> 02:07:00.284]  You have been warned.
[02:07:01.264 --> 02:07:09.987]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:07:09.987 --> 02:07:15.968]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[02:07:15.968 --> 02:07:22.430]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:07:23.070 --> 02:07:26.472]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:07:26.472 --> 02:07:28.913]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:07:35.496 --> 02:07:39.038]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[02:08:02.768 --> 02:08:09.210]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.210 --> 02:08:14.512]  Jason Burmess is going to be riding shotgun the last hour and 40 minutes, so like a stillo.
[02:08:14.512 --> 02:08:22.154]  Speaking of guns, former DEA agent who witnessed government narcotics trafficking set him up on a gun charge.
[02:08:22.154 --> 02:08:27.916]  He was a schoolteacher and he was selling guns illegally for selling a friend a gun.
[02:08:29.361 --> 02:08:32.544]  And then buying some guns from an informant who kept pushing them on him.
[02:08:32.544 --> 02:08:35.145]  It's like Ruby Ridge, what they did there.
[02:08:35.145 --> 02:08:37.407]  It's just amazing.
[02:08:37.407 --> 02:08:38.768]  That's coming up.
[02:08:38.768 --> 02:08:41.510]  I want to take your phone calls for Senator Dean Barkley.
[02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:43.191]  He was there appointed for a month.
[02:08:43.191 --> 02:08:46.194]  When Senator Wellstone died, he's trying to go back there.
[02:08:46.194 --> 02:08:50.397]  And it's senatorbarkley.com.
[02:08:50.397 --> 02:08:51.538]  Drugs!
[02:08:51.538 --> 02:08:55.140]  I mean, the CIA, six months ago, a plane crashed in Mexico with 3.3 tons.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:55.420]  CIA aircraft.
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:04.649]  In fact, it was the well-known plane used to carry people for torture to black op camps in Europe.
[02:09:04.649 --> 02:09:07.394]  What would you do with the phony war on drugs?
[02:09:07.394 --> 02:09:09.518]  The bigger it gets, the more drugs we have on the streets.
[02:09:10.330 --> 02:09:13.692]  Well, I said the war on drugs has been a miserable failure.
[02:09:13.692 --> 02:09:14.693]  It has never worked.
[02:09:14.693 --> 02:09:18.716]  Every time you make something illegal, you just create a whole different class of criminals.
[02:09:18.716 --> 02:09:20.557]  We haven't learned anything from prohibition.
[02:09:20.557 --> 02:09:25.920]  We have to stop putting addicted people into jails and give them the treatment that they need.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.062]  We need to legalize, we need to regulate, and then we can tax it.
[02:09:29.062 --> 02:09:32.164]  Maybe that can help us balance our budget.
[02:09:32.164 --> 02:09:35.667]  Well, you know, heroin, cocaine, and everything was sold at every major
[02:09:37.048 --> 02:09:46.598]  Pharmacy in the nation, and there were people that were addicted to it, but I've seen all the different numbers from the time much lower, about a third of what it is today.
[02:09:46.598 --> 02:09:53.645]  And you know, if you dig around in the countryside or the city anywhere, you find all the old lodnum bottles and things, which was opium.
[02:09:54.225 --> 02:09:55.946]  And some people did get on it.
[02:09:55.946 --> 02:10:00.028]  But you didn't have these feds sneaking around looking in your windows.
[02:10:00.028 --> 02:10:01.989]  You didn't have them shipping in to make the profits.
[02:10:01.989 --> 02:10:03.710]  You didn't have the police being corrupted by it.
[02:10:03.710 --> 02:10:05.871]  And only a third as many people would go.
[02:10:05.871 --> 02:10:07.232]  I mean, what was snake oil?
[02:10:07.232 --> 02:10:08.272]  It'll cure all your ails.
[02:10:08.272 --> 02:10:08.813]  You're depressed?
[02:10:08.813 --> 02:10:10.013]  Drink this cocaine.
[02:10:10.013 --> 02:10:13.575]  Drink this... I think Coca-Cola had cocaine in it at one point.
[02:10:13.715 --> 02:10:15.036]  We did until the mid-30s.
[02:10:15.036 --> 02:10:16.636]  It had a lot of cocaine in it.
[02:10:16.636 --> 02:10:20.738]  In fact, the secret ingredient in coke, this is admitted, is denatured.
[02:10:20.738 --> 02:10:22.079]  It's like decaffeinated coffee.
[02:10:22.079 --> 02:10:25.260]  It's de-coconated cocaine.
[02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:30.162]  And that's where they quote have their secret ingredient plant is in Columbia.
[02:10:31.205 --> 02:10:37.867]  Well, we've got to stop making people make bad choices and get themselves addicted criminals.
[02:10:37.867 --> 02:10:38.888]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:10:38.888 --> 02:10:40.088]  Our prisons are full of them.
[02:10:40.088 --> 02:10:41.708]  And it's because they're addicted.
[02:10:41.708 --> 02:10:45.610]  Let's treat the addiction and let's quit making criminals out of everybody.
[02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:47.170]  People are going to get addicted.
[02:10:47.170 --> 02:10:49.051]  They are going to make bad choices.
[02:10:49.051 --> 02:10:52.652]  We shouldn't have to have them resort to a life of crime in order to do it.
[02:10:52.652 --> 02:10:54.212]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[02:10:54.212 --> 02:10:56.053]  This war on drugs has never worked.
[02:10:56.053 --> 02:10:58.954]  Anyone living on the Texas border knows how bad it is down there.
[02:10:58.954 --> 02:10:59.794]  It's a war zone.
[02:11:00.294 --> 02:11:04.376]  Well, the war on drugs started back in the 30s and it officially kicked off in the 80s, and when you make something, you know,
[02:11:19.422 --> 02:11:19.863]  I think so.
[02:11:44.353 --> 02:11:45.136]  What would you do?
[02:11:45.136 --> 02:11:48.911]  I've been advocating my position for 16 years ever since I got into politics in 1992.
[02:11:51.681 --> 02:11:54.943]  Ventura says you were instrumental in getting him to run.
[02:11:54.943 --> 02:11:58.066]  Tell us a little bit about your history with the Governor Ventura.
[02:11:58.066 --> 02:12:02.349]  Well, Jesse was the honorary chair of my 1996 run for U.S.
[02:12:02.349 --> 02:12:03.129]  Senate of Minnesota.
[02:12:03.129 --> 02:12:10.575]  I was trying to get the Independence Party major party status, which means I had to run for the Senate and get 5% of the vote, which I did.
[02:12:10.575 --> 02:12:14.657]  But he walked my hometown, Annandale, Fourth of July parade in 1996.
[02:12:14.657 --> 02:12:17.800]  I noticed that everybody was cheering for him and ignoring me.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.841]  And I turned to him and said, you know, the wrong guy's running.
[02:12:20.841 --> 02:12:21.741]  You're gonna run next.
[02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:24.481]  Well, he laughed at me, but I worked on him for a year.
[02:12:24.481 --> 02:12:25.962]  I recruited him to run for governor.
[02:12:25.962 --> 02:12:27.942]  I ran his campaign, and we shocked the world in 1998.
[02:12:27.942 --> 02:12:33.583]  So, uh, we showed that it could be done, and, uh, I'm right on track where we were ten years ago.
[02:12:33.583 --> 02:12:40.424]  This campaign is almost exactly where Jesse's was, except the people are much more upset right now, and they have every right to be.
[02:12:40.424 --> 02:12:43.765]  They've just seen their 401Ks disappear because of government.
[02:12:44.345 --> 02:12:46.406]  And I think the timing is right.
[02:12:46.406 --> 02:12:47.627]  This is going to happen again.
[02:12:47.627 --> 02:12:49.248]  Now let's be clear.
[02:12:49.248 --> 02:12:53.411]  I can wave the path and they can run it two years from now.
[02:12:53.411 --> 02:12:54.631]  We can keep on doing that.
[02:12:54.631 --> 02:12:55.152]  Let's be clear.
[02:12:55.152 --> 02:12:56.453]  You're only ten points behind.
[02:12:56.453 --> 02:12:57.873]  Same place Ventura was.
[02:12:57.873 --> 02:12:58.074]  Exactly.
[02:12:58.074 --> 02:12:58.594]  Same place.
[02:13:00.875 --> 02:13:03.098]  But even more undecided than you had back in the 90s.
[02:13:03.098 --> 02:13:05.540]  More undecided than there's going to be.
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:09.565]  About 20% more voters show up than they did for Ventura in the 98.
[02:13:09.565 --> 02:13:13.329]  He had a 60% they're predicting and 80% in Minnesota.
[02:13:13.329 --> 02:13:15.351]  So this thing is just completely up in the air.
[02:13:15.351 --> 02:13:19.155]  And if I can get this TV campaign funded, I'm going to win this thing.
[02:13:19.795 --> 02:13:21.017]  You know, I'll be shameless.
[02:13:21.017 --> 02:13:22.639]  I'll give you the plug for the website again.
[02:13:22.639 --> 02:13:24.962]  It's SenatorBarclay.com.
[02:13:24.962 --> 02:13:28.206]  Or if they want to call the office, our phones are busy right now, so keep trying it.
[02:13:28.206 --> 02:13:28.407]  763-417-9972.
[02:13:28.407 --> 02:13:29.688]  And just do your part.
[02:13:29.688 --> 02:13:32.332]  Like Jesse said, whether it's just $5, it'll all add up.
[02:13:35.897 --> 02:13:39.860]  That's the point I wanted to make.
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:46.166]  Your competitors, the two establishment whores, that's what they are, they have raised $30 million.
[02:13:46.166 --> 02:13:51.271]  You have spent $50,000 and you're within 10 points of beating them.
[02:13:51.271 --> 02:13:56.076]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the example of ideas over fluff and garbage.
[02:13:57.817 --> 02:14:00.140]  Hey Alex, this is Eric from the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:00.841]  Senator Barclay.
[02:14:00.841 --> 02:14:04.224]  Yeah, I just wanted to chime in and tell all my fellow listeners
[02:14:19.770 --> 02:14:21.270]  I'm from Minnesota.
[02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:25.171]  Out there in Minnesota, we've got a whole lot of Swedes and a whole lot of Norwegians.
[02:14:25.171 --> 02:14:35.674]  So if you like the idea of sending an angry Viking up to the Senate, we've got to back this guy.
[02:14:35.674 --> 02:14:38.555]  Okie dokie, as they say in Minnesota.
[02:14:38.555 --> 02:14:41.976]  Is this Eric Nordstrom that did the Ron Paul money bomb and then did mine?
[02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:45.721]  I wanted to talk to him more, yeah.
[02:14:45.721 --> 02:14:48.122]  Well, we should have done a money bomb for you, you know.
[02:14:48.122 --> 02:14:52.424]  I mean, it was his idea and then people saying, you're having a money bomb, you're having a money bomb.
[02:14:52.424 --> 02:14:55.406]  And then suddenly all this money came in and we're using that for the new TV studio.
[02:14:55.406 --> 02:14:58.027]  We'll soon give folks a tour of.
[02:14:58.027 --> 02:15:00.228]  But wow, we should have done a money bomb.
[02:15:00.228 --> 02:15:03.630]  I just really didn't know that much about you, Mr. Barkley.
[02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:04.891]  I wish I would have gotten involved earlier.
[02:15:05.778 --> 02:15:07.320]  Well, it's better late than never.
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:08.080]  We still have time.
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.763]  We still have eight days to go before the election.
[02:15:10.763 --> 02:15:13.866]  And I could say the next three days is when I need to raise the money.
[02:15:13.866 --> 02:15:18.230]  And if I can do it, like I said, Jesse, this will be a huge message.
[02:15:18.230 --> 02:15:19.271]  Let's be clear.
[02:15:19.271 --> 02:15:25.096]  Regardless the TV ads are going to run, just your political experts are telling you you need this extra amount to really be effective.
[02:15:26.244 --> 02:15:27.926]  Yeah, I think I do.
[02:15:27.926 --> 02:15:31.570]  Unfortunately, many, many Minnesotans get their messages from television.
[02:15:31.570 --> 02:15:33.552]  Television is expensive.
[02:15:33.552 --> 02:15:45.884]  I mean, I'm still going to be outspent $400 to $100, but if I can get enough TV ads on the air, we've got the buys already scheduled to go out, we believe we'll get enough coverage that we will then close the deal on this race.
[02:15:46.244 --> 02:15:51.465]  But I'm right now about $30,000-$40,000 short, which is just a pittance compared to what they're doing.
[02:15:51.465 --> 02:15:56.486]  If I can raise $30,000-$40,000 in the next few days, I think this right can be won.
[02:15:56.486 --> 02:15:57.926]  Well, I think it's going to happen here.
[02:15:57.926 --> 02:15:59.126]  We have the best audience in the world.
[02:15:59.126 --> 02:16:00.587]  Eric in Wisconsin.
[02:16:00.587 --> 02:16:01.807]  Eric, you're on the air.
[02:16:01.807 --> 02:16:03.107]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:16:03.107 --> 02:16:04.668]  Good.
[02:16:04.668 --> 02:16:10.549]  I called in before when Jesse Ventura was on the show, and you guys really got me motivated.
[02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:11.969]  I did some research.
[02:16:13.135 --> 02:16:17.156]  We have a candidate here, and I'm in Wisconsin, so I'm just over the river from you.
[02:16:17.156 --> 02:16:18.476]  Oh, those cheese heads, that's okay.
[02:16:18.476 --> 02:16:20.576]  We love cheese heads, too.
[02:16:20.576 --> 02:16:23.537]  Well, you know what?
[02:16:23.537 --> 02:16:41.200]  Setting the football aside, Kevin Barrett's running for Congress over here, and I met him recently, and I'm helping him with his campaign, and we did a video shoot on YouTube where Kevin Barrett actually gave Ron Kind his pink slip, wearing a V for Vendetta mask.
[02:16:42.028 --> 02:16:42.488]  We're good.
[02:16:42.488 --> 02:16:44.849]  Fire out the website, then.
[02:16:44.849 --> 02:16:49.612]  His website is Kevin Barrett for Congress.us.
[02:16:49.612 --> 02:16:50.452]  Okay, I'm gonna jump.
[02:16:50.452 --> 02:16:52.854]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:52.854 --> 02:16:54.655]  Let's talk to Matt in New York.
[02:16:54.655 --> 02:16:55.335]  You're on the air, Matt.
[02:16:56.219 --> 02:16:56.839]  Alex, you there?
[02:16:56.839 --> 02:16:57.319]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:57.319 --> 02:16:57.900]  Hey, Alex.
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:16:58.820]  Hey, Senator Barclay.
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:01.361]  It's Matt from MobilizeThePeople.com.
[02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:04.582]  Alex, I want to thank you for waking me up a few years back.
[02:17:04.582 --> 02:17:07.223]  You've definitely set the example on the bar pretty high.
[02:17:07.223 --> 02:17:12.265]  It's actually refreshing to hear from representatives like Senator Barclay on your show.
[02:17:12.265 --> 02:17:19.327]  Alex, Thomas Jefferson once prophetically said that every government degenerates when trusted to the rules of the people alone.
[02:17:19.327 --> 02:17:22.428]  The people themselves, therefore, are only safe depositories.
[02:17:23.428 --> 02:17:28.911]  How do you guys, Senator Barkley especially, how do you feel about that?
[02:17:28.911 --> 02:17:30.212]  Jefferson was a wise man.
[02:17:30.212 --> 02:17:37.656]  Jefferson also said that having a revolution every generation would be good for our democracy.
[02:17:37.656 --> 02:17:39.437]  I think the time is right for that.
[02:17:42.151 --> 02:17:44.932]  Nourished from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[02:17:44.932 --> 02:17:57.777]  Yeah, I recently spoke with Chuck Schumer over here in New York, and I was asking about the Federal Reserve, and to be quite honest, these incumbent politicians, they have absolutely no answers, no responses.
[02:17:57.777 --> 02:18:00.138]  Either they're clueless, or they just don't want to acknowledge it.
[02:18:00.138 --> 02:18:01.059]  No, they aren't clueless.
[02:18:01.059 --> 02:18:03.079]  They're bought and paid for the New World Order.
[02:18:03.079 --> 02:18:04.180]  Gotta jump, Matt.
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:05.861]  Wayne in Mississippi.
[02:18:05.861 --> 02:18:08.602]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:18:08.602 --> 02:18:09.002]  Hello?
[02:18:09.002 --> 02:18:09.282]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:10.174 --> 02:18:11.135]  How you doing, sir?
[02:18:11.135 --> 02:18:11.315]  Good.
[02:18:11.315 --> 02:18:13.176]  Thanks for what you're doing, man.
[02:18:13.176 --> 02:18:16.439]  Well, I'm a RAC vet, and I got a couple questions to ask you.
[02:18:16.439 --> 02:18:17.200]  Okay, sir.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:17.520]  Go ahead.
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.401]  Alright, man.
[02:18:19.401 --> 02:18:22.784]  What are you gonna plan to do about the VA system?
[02:18:22.784 --> 02:18:27.048]  And what are you gonna do about clarifying the casualty report over there?
[02:18:27.048 --> 02:18:29.430]  Because what they flash on CNN ain't true.
[02:18:29.430 --> 02:18:29.890]  That's right.
[02:18:29.890 --> 02:18:33.493]  If you die out of country, they don't count it as a death, so it's really close to 18,000, not 5,000.
[02:18:33.493 --> 02:18:34.033]  Correct, sir?
[02:18:34.033 --> 02:18:34.414]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:39.317 --> 02:18:41.559]  Absolutely, what we're going to do with our veterans.
[02:18:41.559 --> 02:18:47.605]  We have 700 foreign military bases, we have troops in Germany and Japan that we don't need.
[02:18:47.605 --> 02:18:55.952]  If we cut those costs, we'll actually have more than enough money to adequately care for those who have given their lives and they've become wounded and coming back.
[02:18:55.952 --> 02:18:58.635]  We have an obligation to make sure our vets are taken care of.
[02:18:58.635 --> 02:19:00.917]  What about an investigation on the casualty reports?
[02:19:01.417 --> 02:19:03.038]  Well, that's the first time I've heard that.
[02:19:03.038 --> 02:19:07.661]  I'm sorry, but I certainly would take a look at that if they're underestimating or underreporting casualties.
[02:19:07.661 --> 02:19:11.203]  You know, it's just another one of the lies that led us into this, and we have to undercut that.
[02:19:11.203 --> 02:19:15.826]  Well, it's like not letting people photograph the coffins or the funerals.
[02:19:15.826 --> 02:19:17.267]  Yeah, they don't see you.
[02:19:17.267 --> 02:19:20.049]  If you die in Iraq, it counts.
[02:19:20.049 --> 02:19:23.051]  But if you die in Rammstein, or you die back in the U.S.
[02:19:23.051 --> 02:19:25.533]  a month later, a week later, a day later, it doesn't count.
[02:19:25.533 --> 02:19:27.414]  No, they're just trying to sanitize war, aren't they?
[02:19:28.382 --> 02:19:29.682]  You know, it's just incredible.
[02:19:29.682 --> 02:19:38.785]  I mean, uh... No, if you got shot in Iraq, that's a pretty... No, I'll be honest, the first time I heard that, and then you die in a hospital outside of Iraq, that doesn't count.
[02:19:38.785 --> 02:19:41.126]  But do we know what the real death toll is?
[02:19:41.126 --> 02:19:45.267]  Yeah, it's around 18,000, according to sources in any major institutions.
[02:19:45.267 --> 02:19:45.627]  You know what?
[02:19:45.987 --> 02:19:51.533]  I know you've got a lot of other interviews coming up, but can we do five more minutes on the other side so we can finish up with these calls?
[02:19:51.533 --> 02:19:52.133]  Sure.
[02:19:52.133 --> 02:19:53.214]  Okay.
[02:19:53.214 --> 02:19:56.217]  Former Senator Dean Barkley, he was there appointed for a month.
[02:19:56.217 --> 02:19:58.960]  He's the guy that got Jesse Ventura into politics.
[02:19:58.960 --> 02:19:59.641]  He's a great guy.
[02:19:59.641 --> 02:20:00.502]  We need to get behind him.
[02:20:00.502 --> 02:20:01.323]  Close race in Minnesota.
[02:20:02.063 --> 02:20:06.949]  Phase one of the insider's plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:20:06.949 --> 02:20:14.417]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[02:20:14.417 --> 02:20:16.059]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[02:20:16.059 --> 02:20:16.800]  Their next engineered
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:17.040]  We're good.
[02:20:35.506 --> 02:20:35.666]  Let's go!
[02:21:02.137 --> 02:21:08.908]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.908 --> 02:21:11.551]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:11.551 --> 02:21:13.094]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:13.094 --> 02:21:13.895]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.895 --> 02:21:14.756]  This is his MO.
[02:21:14.756 --> 02:21:16.278]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:16.278 --> 02:21:17.881]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:18.241 --> 02:21:25.391]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:25.391 --> 02:21:25.872]  Some U.S.
[02:21:25.872 --> 02:21:32.240]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:35.685]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:35.925 --> 02:21:46.212]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:46.212 --> 02:21:47.433]  Fabled enemies.
[02:21:47.433 --> 02:21:54.958]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:54.958 --> 02:21:58.561]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:01.974 --> 02:22:04.075]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:04.075 --> 02:22:04.415]  October 27, 2008.
[02:22:04.415 --> 02:22:05.495]  Gold opened this morning at $714.80.
[02:22:05.495 --> 02:22:08.656]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $737.26, $368.63 for half ounce, and $184.31 for quarter ounce.
[02:22:08.656 --> 02:22:09.416]  That's $737.26, $368.63, and $184.31.
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:25.705]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:22:25.705 --> 02:22:29.989]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[02:22:29.989 --> 02:22:37.837]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:22:37.837 --> 02:22:40.199]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:22:40.459 --> 02:22:44.223]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:22:44.223 --> 02:22:50.469]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:53.713]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.713 --> 02:22:56.736]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[02:22:56.736 --> 02:22:56.996]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.996 --> 02:22:57.176]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.350 --> 02:23:12.097]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism, comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[02:23:12.097 --> 02:23:15.820]  Her face was every face I've ever known.
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.841]  Her face was my own face.
[02:23:17.841 --> 02:23:22.464]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.
[02:23:22.464 --> 02:23:25.066]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[02:23:25.066 --> 02:23:28.068]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping, and more.
[02:23:28.068 --> 02:23:31.250]  The enemy of my enemy is my ally.
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:35.480]  Jason Bernes in studio with us.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:37.281]  He'll be with us for the rest of the broadcast today.
[02:23:37.281 --> 02:23:38.981]  He's still coming up.
[02:23:38.981 --> 02:23:44.602]  Talking to Dean Barkley, SenatorBarkley.com.
[02:23:44.602 --> 02:23:45.723]  Number to their campaign, 763-417-9972.
[02:23:45.723 --> 02:23:45.803]  763-417-9972.
[02:23:45.803 --> 02:23:47.403]  Your chance to be part of history.
[02:23:47.403 --> 02:23:47.663]  Take action.
[02:23:58.131 --> 02:23:58.952]  Will it fix everything?
[02:23:58.952 --> 02:24:02.374]  Probably not, but we know if we sit on our butts, it'll only get worse.
[02:24:02.374 --> 02:24:04.816]  Think of how bad it would be if we weren't taking action.
[02:24:04.816 --> 02:24:07.479]  So taking action is half the battle.
[02:24:07.479 --> 02:24:08.940]  I've got unlimited calls to take.
[02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:12.443]  We've got to let our guests go here in about five minutes.
[02:24:12.443 --> 02:24:15.345]  Let's talk to AJ in Minnesota.
[02:24:15.345 --> 02:24:18.347]  AJ in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:24:18.347 --> 02:24:21.470]  Yes, hey Alex Dean, it's a pleasure to be with you fine gentleman today.
[02:24:22.519 --> 02:24:27.803]  Before I get to my question here, I just wanted to say, Alex, I tuned in on the web to the concert last night and it was fantastic.
[02:24:27.803 --> 02:24:29.424]  I appreciate you getting that organized.
[02:24:30.171 --> 02:24:30.952]  You bet, you bet.
[02:24:30.952 --> 02:24:48.550]  Well really, what it was, is Willie invited us to that concert and then we did some live feeds, but the whole thing was going late, it was overfilled, a whole lot of stuff went on, but we are going to have videos of us there doing interviews and doing live feeds, and some of the feeds didn't go out, but we have recordings from there, so the stuff where the web was going out on us, we're going to get up.
[02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:49.771]  But go ahead and ask your question, sir.
[02:24:49.771 --> 02:24:51.092]  Great, I'll check for it.
[02:24:51.092 --> 02:24:52.974]  Yeah, my question was to both of you.
[02:24:54.947 --> 02:25:00.649]  I don't know if you were aware of the End the Fed campaign that's being organized for November 22nd.
[02:25:00.649 --> 02:25:01.149]  Yes, I know.
[02:25:01.149 --> 02:25:03.510]  Genesis is promoting that.
[02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:04.531]  Oh, sure.
[02:25:04.531 --> 02:25:05.671]  Running ads for it.
[02:25:05.671 --> 02:25:08.292]  Obviously, you're in support of it, Alex.
[02:25:08.292 --> 02:25:09.413]  Senator, if you were aware of that.
[02:25:09.413 --> 02:25:13.494]  Yeah, there's demonstrations everywhere to end the private Federal Reserve.
[02:25:13.494 --> 02:25:16.055]  Are you aware of that New World War Operation, Senator?
[02:25:16.055 --> 02:25:16.656]  No, I haven't.
[02:25:16.656 --> 02:25:17.596]  I'm not aware of that.
[02:25:17.596 --> 02:25:22.858]  But I have as many questions as anyone of what the Federal Reserve, why it was created in the first place.
[02:25:23.382 --> 02:25:27.763]  Why we gave up our currency and our treasury to a private institution.
[02:25:27.763 --> 02:25:38.545]  And I certainly am very interested in that position that you're taking, and I certainly will listen to your arguments as to why we think the Federal Reserve has to go.
[02:25:38.545 --> 02:25:40.386]  Alright, anything else, AJ?
[02:25:40.386 --> 02:25:41.306]  What's that?
[02:25:41.306 --> 02:25:44.786]  Anything else from Minnesota?
[02:25:44.786 --> 02:25:46.987]  No, that should be it.
[02:25:46.987 --> 02:25:51.048]  I plan to be out there at our regional branch here in Minneapolis on the 22nd.
[02:25:52.555 --> 02:26:03.964]  Anybody that's listening, I encourage you to get out there and support us.
[02:26:03.964 --> 02:26:07.187]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:26:07.187 --> 02:26:13.091]  Alex, I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for opening up my eyes to what's going on in this country today.
[02:26:13.091 --> 02:26:21.638]  My question, or comment really, to the Senator is this is the first time ever I've heard of a Senator that's running for President
[02:26:22.168 --> 02:26:26.612]  Sit and talk on a regular talk show where people can actually ask them a question.
[02:26:26.612 --> 02:26:28.614]  They're running for Senate now.
[02:26:28.614 --> 02:26:29.095]  Pardon me?
[02:26:29.095 --> 02:26:31.657]  Running for Senate, yes.
[02:26:31.657 --> 02:26:34.540]  I mean, it's just nice to have that today.
[02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:37.622]  It really is.
[02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:44.709]  It's just nice for the average person to be able to reach out to a politician.
[02:26:45.151 --> 02:26:47.113]  Well, I have to wait in the long line.
[02:26:47.113 --> 02:26:47.733]  Absolutely.
[02:26:47.733 --> 02:26:48.734]  Appreciate it.
[02:26:48.734 --> 02:26:50.996]  And one thing I wanted to tell you, Alex.
[02:26:50.996 --> 02:26:54.600]  I live in a small community here in New Jersey.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:58.383]  And believe it or not, I walked into a store that I always go in.
[02:26:58.383 --> 02:26:59.964]  It's a pharmacy.
[02:26:59.964 --> 02:27:03.708]  And believe it or not, the employees have a thumb scan on the register here now.
[02:27:04.537 --> 02:27:04.837]  No, no.
[02:27:04.837 --> 02:27:07.678]  Thumb scanners to buy and sell going in everywhere.
[02:27:07.678 --> 02:27:10.939]  This is the control grid to shut down any underground economy.
[02:27:10.939 --> 02:27:12.500]  This is total enslavement.
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:14.180]  Appreciate your call.
[02:27:14.180 --> 02:27:17.141]  I take it you're not for Big Brother either, Senator Barkley?
[02:27:17.141 --> 02:27:22.583]  No, I read George Orwell in 1984 and I think that we're there.
[02:27:22.583 --> 02:27:26.385]  Well, in closing, overall, what do you think of the election this year?
[02:27:26.385 --> 02:27:28.345]  Just the presidential one.
[02:27:28.345 --> 02:27:29.526]  Well, I think we've got
[02:27:30.948 --> 02:27:33.448]  I don't know, you know, who I'm going to vote for yet.
[02:27:33.448 --> 02:27:37.389]  I was hoping that Ron Paul would have run as an independent.
[02:27:37.389 --> 02:27:40.530]  We'd have a real choice in the election by now.
[02:27:40.530 --> 02:27:41.430]  Well, he's endorsed.
[02:27:41.430 --> 02:27:43.050]  He's endorsed.
[02:27:43.050 --> 02:27:47.951]  Of course, Chuck Baldwin had a Constitution Party much better than Bob Barr.
[02:27:47.951 --> 02:27:50.952]  Okay, well, you know, we do have Barr.
[02:27:50.952 --> 02:27:52.212]  We do have choices.
[02:27:52.212 --> 02:27:56.793]  I urge people to educate themselves and take a look at who you really want.
[02:27:56.793 --> 02:27:58.273]  I mean, the horse race between
[02:27:59.928 --> 02:28:09.955]  And Obama, you know, that's not the only race going on out there, so, you know, go out and find out what these alternatives are, and if you don't like the Democrat or Republican, we'll send a message.
[02:28:09.955 --> 02:28:11.315]  Let's cram one more in.
[02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:13.657]  Jose from New York, go ahead.
[02:28:13.657 --> 02:28:14.818]  Hi Alex, hi.
[02:28:14.818 --> 02:28:20.921]  First time caller and listener for at least a year now, and I too am glad that you opened my eyes to it.
[02:28:20.921 --> 02:28:26.325]  Also an EMT in New York City and New York State.
[02:28:26.325 --> 02:28:28.006]  A question for the Senator.
[02:28:30.594 --> 02:28:34.134]  I just wanted to know, did you hear of the Codex Elementaris?
[02:28:34.134 --> 02:28:36.695]  I haven't heard of that issue, so I don't want to pretend I know.
[02:28:36.695 --> 02:28:36.755]  No.
[02:28:36.755 --> 02:28:36.935]  We're not.
[02:28:51.653 --> 02:28:53.135]  Well, sir, it's been an amazing interview.
[02:28:53.135 --> 02:29:02.025]  Let me get you back up once the ads are running, maybe Friday or something, as we go into the last days of this key election for a quick update.

[02:29:12.954 --> 02:29:13.255]  You bet.
[02:29:13.255 --> 02:29:15.598]  It was great having you here and we will talk to you very soon.
[02:29:15.598 --> 02:29:16.819]  I'll say bye to you here off air.
[02:29:16.819 --> 02:29:18.682]  We'll be right back with Jason Burman, Soto Costello.
[02:29:18.682 --> 02:29:19.102]  Stay with us.
[02:29:19.102 --> 02:29:19.423]  More calls.

[02:29:39.421 --> 02:29:40.922]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:29:40.922 --> 02:29:45.185]  Well, thank you for, uh, for giving me the opportunity to, uh, to speak to you, uh, your listeners.
[02:29:45.185 --> 02:29:45.505]  You bet.
[02:29:45.505 --> 02:29:47.847]  It was great having you here, and we will talk to you very soon.
[02:29:47.847 --> 02:29:49.048]  I'll say bye to you here off-air.
[02:29:49.048 --> 02:29:50.288]  We'll be right back with Jason Burma.
[02:29:50.288 --> 02:29:51.329]  Still, though, stay with us.
[02:29:51.329 --> 02:29:52.010]  More calls.

[02:30:53.384 --> 02:30:53.604]  That's 239-628-3708.
[02:30:53.604 --> 02:30:54.004]  Call today!
[02:31:07.919 --> 02:31:09.100]  It's an inside job!
[02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:10.281]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:31:10.281 --> 02:31:11.983]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:31:11.983 --> 02:31:14.826]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged?
[02:31:14.826 --> 02:31:18.709]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.A.
[02:31:18.709 --> 02:31:28.178]  Farm... The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[02:31:28.178 --> 02:31:33.083]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:31:36.819 --> 02:31:39.260]  How dare you?
[02:31:39.260 --> 02:31:44.502]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:31:44.502 --> 02:31:47.143]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:31:47.143 --> 02:31:53.726]  And if the government has not told the truth, in 5 years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:31:58.809 --> 02:32:01.290]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:06.401]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[02:32:06.401 --> 02:32:07.881]  The banks are crashing.
[02:32:07.881 --> 02:32:09.481]  The stock market's a mess.
[02:32:09.481 --> 02:32:11.141]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[02:32:11.141 --> 02:32:13.082]  There's the lending crisis.
[02:32:13.082 --> 02:32:17.743]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[02:32:17.743 --> 02:32:19.323]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[02:32:19.323 --> 02:32:21.283]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[02:32:21.283 --> 02:32:22.083]  I don't know what to say.
[02:32:22.083 --> 02:32:22.884]  What can you do?
[02:32:22.884 --> 02:32:23.744]  Do what you can do.
[02:32:23.744 --> 02:32:24.344]  That's what you do.
[02:32:24.344 --> 02:32:25.484]  You do what you can do.
[02:32:25.484 --> 02:32:27.284]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[02:32:27.284 --> 02:32:29.065]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[02:32:29.065 --> 02:32:29.625]  I can read it.
[02:32:29.625 --> 02:32:30.345]  I can go to eFoods.
[02:32:38.479 --> 02:32:42.161]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the rest of the broadcast.
[02:32:42.161 --> 02:32:48.485]  This man, here on your screen, Jason Burmas, is riding shotgun with us.
[02:32:48.485 --> 02:32:50.166]  Burmas, you lived down here for what, five months?
[02:32:50.166 --> 02:32:51.147]  About four.
[02:32:51.147 --> 02:32:52.427]  About four, four and a half, yeah.
[02:32:52.427 --> 02:32:59.071]  Yeah, it was really great having you down here, and it's like old times to have you back, and we're just now about to move the next week or so out of this office.
[02:32:59.071 --> 02:33:04.315]  We're building the radio studio and the TV studio, and it's trying to save money and order stuff.
[02:33:04.935 --> 02:33:11.519]  You know, off eBay and stuff for the parts, because we couldn't afford it if we bought even the low-grade stuff for real TV studios.
[02:33:11.519 --> 02:33:14.260]  On radio, we've got some decent equipment, but that's getting built up.
[02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:14.921]  That's happening.
[02:33:14.921 --> 02:33:16.682]  Have we given you a tour of the new office yet?
[02:33:16.682 --> 02:33:22.065]  Yeah, I was actually down there the last day that I was here, before I flew out.
[02:33:22.065 --> 02:33:25.847]  I went down there and I was with Tim's sister and I got the whole tour, the whole place.
[02:33:25.847 --> 02:33:26.567]  It's exciting, Alex.
[02:33:26.567 --> 02:33:27.688]  But now it's all filled up.
[02:33:27.688 --> 02:33:29.429]  Yeah, it's like 7,800 square feet.
[02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.709]  This is 2,200.
[02:33:29.709 --> 02:33:31.370]  Yeah, I haven't been in here in a while.
[02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:32.711]  We're crammed in here like sardines.
[02:33:33.511 --> 02:33:35.872]  And we have another little satellite office because this wasn't big enough.
[02:33:35.872 --> 02:33:36.752]  We're getting rid of both of these.
[02:33:36.752 --> 02:33:37.952]  We just got rid of the other one.
[02:33:37.952 --> 02:33:39.193]  We're getting rid of this one.
[02:33:39.193 --> 02:33:41.373]  And thanks to everybody's support out there.
[02:33:41.373 --> 02:33:52.297]  I want to go to phone calls and talk about all the insane news here today, but I was going to have you just do the show today, but then Ventura's like, let's get Dean on.
[02:33:52.297 --> 02:33:53.817]  Let's try to help him.
[02:33:53.817 --> 02:33:54.577]  And so I came in.
[02:33:54.577 --> 02:33:55.438]  I'm not trying to be a wimp.
[02:33:55.438 --> 02:33:56.658]  I'm not like Ventura, man.
[02:33:56.658 --> 02:33:58.839]  Three hours sleeping for two days of tiring shooting.
[02:33:59.818 --> 02:34:01.459]  I'm fried right now.
[02:34:01.459 --> 02:34:03.560]  I mean, I am just really tired right now.
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:05.221]  How good does it feel to get that response?
[02:34:05.221 --> 02:34:08.823]  I mean, he said his phone's off the hook, the website's all over the place.
[02:34:08.823 --> 02:34:10.944]  You might help this guy win a one-in-a-hundred election.
[02:34:10.944 --> 02:34:13.426]  You know, I mean, we only have two senators per state.
[02:34:13.426 --> 02:34:14.366]  This is a huge election.
[02:34:14.366 --> 02:34:17.708]  To get an independent on the Senate floor would be very big.
[02:34:17.708 --> 02:34:19.109]  So I hope this continues all day.
[02:34:19.109 --> 02:34:24.272]  I know you're rebroadcast all day on AM and FM, shortwave, of course, on the Internet.
[02:34:24.272 --> 02:34:25.333]  I don't want people to let up.
[02:34:25.333 --> 02:34:26.774]  You know, let's get this guy elected.
[02:34:26.774 --> 02:34:28.875]  At least we'll have one win in this election season.
[02:34:29.355 --> 02:34:30.696]  Well, it's the will to resist.
[02:34:30.696 --> 02:34:49.204]  I mean, it's all, and of course there's election fraud, but I found with Minnesota, and I've studied the states, we've had all the voting experts on, Florida's real bad, California's real bad, New York, New Hampshire, all those key states, but Minnesota has some electronic machines, some fraud, but the people are so involved there with, you heard him, 80-something percent highest voter turnout in the country on average.
[02:34:49.204 --> 02:34:50.264]  I mean, they're really active there.
[02:34:50.264 --> 02:34:52.905]  They've had a lot of problems putting in their fraudulent systems.
[02:34:52.905 --> 02:34:56.647]  That's why we've been seeing some independents and people get in there.
[02:34:56.647 --> 02:34:56.927]  But hey,
[02:34:58.308 --> 02:35:04.592]  The problem is we have three cameras that shot about three-and-a-half hours of footage at Willie's house.
[02:35:04.592 --> 02:35:08.775]  We were there about four, but we shot for three-and-a-half hours.
[02:35:08.775 --> 02:35:11.477]  We had some behind-the-scenes discussions we didn't want to tape.
[02:35:11.477 --> 02:35:22.384]  So imagine, we have all those tapes, then we have about two hours to tape per camera, three cameras, with Ventura driving around in the days he was here, day-and-a-half he was here, or a little more than day-and-a-half.
[02:35:22.384 --> 02:35:24.025]  Point is, it came in Saturday, left today.
[02:35:24.965 --> 02:35:27.347]  All this going on, that we're going to get this up for everybody.
[02:35:27.347 --> 02:35:30.129]  People are like, oh yeah, interesting, Willie Nelson and Ventura and Alex Jones.
[02:35:30.129 --> 02:35:32.891]  No, there's some incredible stuff.
[02:35:32.891 --> 02:35:35.713]  Now, some of it was off-record, we're not going to get into.
[02:35:35.713 --> 02:35:37.354]  I guess the camera's rusted, it doesn't matter.
[02:35:37.354 --> 02:35:40.216]  But without getting into too much of what's going on and some of the things Ventura and I are
[02:35:40.736 --> 02:35:45.818]  Absolutely, and to have Willie Nelson sit there with an independent like Jesse Ventura and really a maverick like yourself
[02:36:00.465 --> 02:36:03.307]  And discuss the issues that still matter.
[02:36:03.307 --> 02:36:05.349]  9-11 still matters.
[02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:06.830]  This presidential election still matters.
[02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:09.873]  Talk about the bailout with us and that criminal enterprise.
[02:36:09.873 --> 02:36:13.756]  We talked about farming and how they've made that into a criminal enterprise.
[02:36:13.756 --> 02:36:16.217]  So, you know, it was just so awesome, Alex.
[02:36:16.217 --> 02:36:17.118]  I mean, this is an icon.
[02:36:17.118 --> 02:36:19.080]  This is somebody who's not going to be around forever.
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:21.081]  I mean, Willie's 75 years old, you know.
[02:36:22.202 --> 02:36:25.946]  We will make these interviews live on forever, and that's what's great about what we do.
[02:36:25.946 --> 02:36:32.112]  You know, our work will live on far beyond, you know, Alex Jones, Jason Bermas, Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson.
[02:36:32.112 --> 02:36:39.359]  And to have somebody with that much influence, I mean, you saw those people going crazy for him last night when he was on stage, 6,000 people roaring for Willie Nelson.
[02:36:39.359 --> 02:36:39.600]  Well, it's...
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:44.085]  More like probably 60 million worldwide that listen to what he has to say.
[02:36:44.085 --> 02:36:47.328]  So I'm so stoked what we've been able to accomplish in the last two days.
[02:36:47.328 --> 02:36:51.253]  I'm so excited to put this out for other people to listen to, to other people to see.
[02:36:51.253 --> 02:36:54.416]  And when you see, again, how this man lives, you won't believe it.
[02:36:54.416 --> 02:36:55.077]  I mean, it's
[02:36:55.097 --> 02:36:57.098]  He's got all these hills and mountains all around him.
[02:36:57.098 --> 02:36:57.499]  He's up on top of it.
[02:37:16.971 --> 02:37:22.572]  Yeah, yeah, and it's, you know, like you said... The point is, it's always great to be up on a big vista with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura.
[02:37:22.572 --> 02:37:29.714]  Yeah, and Nelson talking about how, you know, again, at that age, how he's on 200 venues a year, live, and then working even more than that.
[02:37:29.714 --> 02:37:31.035]  And making two or three movies a year.
[02:37:31.035 --> 02:37:31.755]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:31.755 --> 02:37:36.236]  And he's even built his own little, kind of like, western studio place.
[02:37:36.236 --> 02:37:44.018]  It's kind of like, you're going into one of those old villages, and then he's got... They built it in the 70s, and because it's old churches and real old buildings, they brought in from all over Texas.
[02:37:44.878 --> 02:37:47.019]  It's like you're in the real deal with the weeds growing up.
[02:37:47.019 --> 02:37:48.539]  I mean, it's not like it's even a fake town.
[02:37:48.539 --> 02:37:51.100]  Yeah, Jesse Ventura said it was like being in Gunsmoke.
[02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:54.341]  He was just waiting for somebody to walk out of the saloon and take out their six-shooter.
[02:37:54.341 --> 02:37:56.221]  So, I thought that was great.
[02:37:56.221 --> 02:37:58.682]  You know, it was just an incredible time.
[02:37:58.682 --> 02:38:02.103]  We're sitting there, we're looking at the red-headed stranger poster.
[02:38:02.103 --> 02:38:06.164]  We're looking at just Willie throughout the years in the background, and he doesn't really care about himself.
[02:38:06.164 --> 02:38:07.945]  I mean, he's just listening to a little radio.
[02:38:08.585 --> 02:38:09.807]  Hanging out behind the bar.
[02:38:09.807 --> 02:38:11.528]  It was just the coolest thing ever.
[02:38:11.528 --> 02:38:13.911]  I mean, how about the shot of him on the lawnmower?
[02:38:13.911 --> 02:38:14.932]  You know, he just did that.
[02:38:14.932 --> 02:38:16.914]  He just suddenly jumps out of the truck.
[02:38:16.914 --> 02:38:18.835]  Me and Willie riding around in his truck.
[02:38:18.835 --> 02:38:20.237]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:20.237 --> 02:38:22.779]  And he looked like he was having a grand old time.
[02:38:22.779 --> 02:38:28.285]  You see the last video he shot with Woody Harrelson was all up at his house, and he has a little track race.
[02:38:28.285 --> 02:38:29.506]  We even got to meet some of his family.
[02:38:29.506 --> 02:38:30.687]  They were very nice people.
[02:38:30.687 --> 02:38:30.887]  I mean,
[02:38:31.568 --> 02:38:33.328]  What an experience, folks.
[02:38:33.328 --> 02:38:34.209]  I mean, what an experience.
[02:38:34.209 --> 02:38:45.531]  And the way Jesse was mobbed when we actually went to the backyard in the back, I mean, you couldn't walk five feet without somebody coming up to Ventura and being, oh, Jesse, can I get a, I need a, I need a picture right now, Jesse, I love what you do.
[02:38:45.531 --> 02:38:49.292]  And I mean, just as an indicator of how far our movement's gone, we were mobbed by the people.
[02:38:49.292 --> 02:38:51.012]  Not just in the front, but in the backstage.
[02:38:51.012 --> 02:38:52.993]  Oh yeah, there were plenty of people coming up to you.
[02:38:52.993 --> 02:38:53.573]  Myself included, yeah.
[02:38:54.113 --> 02:38:55.153]  Alex, I love what you do.
[02:38:55.153 --> 02:38:55.814]  Thank you so much.
[02:38:55.814 --> 02:38:57.814]  It shows we're really having an effect.
[02:38:57.814 --> 02:38:59.234]  And the thing is, people have to get ready to win.
[02:38:59.234 --> 02:39:11.778]  You have to get ready for us to get Best Actress this year, and German defense ministers, and an Italian former president, and Hollywood people, and Bruce Willis, and Rick Linklater, and Naomi Wolf, all these mainline liberals.
[02:39:11.778 --> 02:39:13.418]  We have to be ready to win.
[02:39:13.418 --> 02:39:15.359]  We have to be ready to wake up conservatives and liberals.
[02:39:15.359 --> 02:39:17.960]  We have to be ready to have icons come to our aid.
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:22.623]  You know, that's showing their courage to speak out.
[02:39:22.623 --> 02:39:26.185]  And I have to say, you know, some of Willie's folks are scared of what he's doing with us.
[02:39:26.185 --> 02:39:30.649]  You know, he's been death-threatened quite a bit for coming on this show, and he hasn't given in to it.
[02:39:30.649 --> 02:39:34.052]  But, you know, some of the people around him don't like it.
[02:39:34.052 --> 02:39:35.633]  And so that's something that has to be understood, too.
[02:39:35.633 --> 02:39:41.538]  There are people out there that are doing everything they can to stop this information from coming out.
[02:39:41.538 --> 02:39:43.940]  We've been getting a lot of death threats here at the office lately.
[02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:45.040]  I don't know.
[02:40:02.694 --> 02:40:03.735]  That's the key.
[02:40:03.735 --> 02:40:08.118]  Also the live little speeches we did there, some of the reports we did from the venue.
[02:40:08.118 --> 02:40:09.418]  So that is all coming up.
[02:40:09.418 --> 02:40:12.560]  Burmish, you never turn your cell phone off when you come into the studio.
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:12.821]  I try.
[02:40:12.821 --> 02:40:14.582]  But you're like holding it instead of turning it off.
[02:40:14.582 --> 02:40:17.323]  Just take it out and turn it off.
[02:40:17.323 --> 02:40:18.364]  Turning it off, sir.
[02:40:18.364 --> 02:40:21.086]  I know it's radical to say turn your cell phone off.
[02:40:21.086 --> 02:40:21.946]  Hey, look at mine.
[02:40:21.946 --> 02:40:23.547]  It's turned off.
[02:40:23.547 --> 02:40:24.288]  See, mine's busted.
[02:40:24.288 --> 02:40:24.888]  It's hard to turn it off.
[02:40:24.888 --> 02:40:25.509]  Alright, there we go.
[02:40:25.509 --> 02:40:25.829]  Got it done.
[02:40:28.972 --> 02:40:29.893]  Oh, boy.
[02:40:29.893 --> 02:40:32.935]  You've got my cell phone, good sir.
[02:40:32.935 --> 02:40:35.877]  Put these on both sides of my head and cook my brain.
[02:40:35.877 --> 02:40:39.840]  How about Jesse Ventura refusing to carry a cell phone?
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:40.360]  I love the government.
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:42.162]  I love the New World Order.
[02:40:42.162 --> 02:40:44.543]  Ah, the government's good, they never lie.
[02:40:44.543 --> 02:40:45.964]  Everything's fine.
[02:40:45.964 --> 02:40:51.088]  Sure, they're talking about martial law all over the news and rioting and police state, but it's safe.
[02:40:51.088 --> 02:40:52.209]  Oh, the government loves me.
[02:40:54.390 --> 02:40:57.972]  I'm going to keep this for the duration of the broadcast.
[02:40:57.972 --> 02:41:00.873]  Like the teacher, I'm going to sit it right over here.
[02:41:00.873 --> 02:41:03.274]  You want this.
[02:41:03.274 --> 02:41:05.855]  Take me and strike me down with it.
[02:41:05.855 --> 02:41:07.195]  All of your power.
[02:41:07.195 --> 02:41:08.856]  It's hard not to be hooked in, Alex.
[02:41:08.856 --> 02:41:15.859]  I mean, I guess I kind of envy Ventura because he won't carry around a cell phone, but how is anyone going to get in touch with that man while he's down in Mexico?
[02:41:15.859 --> 02:41:16.839]  I guess it's just not going to happen.
[02:41:16.839 --> 02:41:17.379]  That's the plan.
[02:41:17.379 --> 02:41:18.640]  Yeah, I know that is the plan.
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:19.500]  Good for him.
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:20.641]  I can't leave society.
[02:41:20.641 --> 02:41:21.361]  I know where he lives now.
[02:41:21.821 --> 02:41:22.322]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:41:22.322 --> 02:41:26.325]  We talked about his whole deal and, dude, again, just awesome.
[02:41:26.325 --> 02:41:32.970]  I mean, Jesse Ventura's talking about how he's powering his whole home down there by solar energy, you know, getting off the grid.
[02:41:32.970 --> 02:41:34.731]  And again, people say, oh, who cares about celebrities?
[02:41:34.731 --> 02:41:35.812]  Well, the point is, the culture does.
[02:41:35.812 --> 02:41:36.413]  They're mad with it.
[02:41:36.413 --> 02:41:37.494]  They're obsessed with it.
[02:41:37.494 --> 02:41:44.199]  And to have big celebrities coming out for 9-11 Truth, coming out against the war, coming out against the New World Order, that is the shift in society.
[02:41:44.199 --> 02:41:45.480]  And the establishment is scared.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:48.883]  And then, to find out that, you know, Jesse Ventura is so real, too.
[02:41:49.383 --> 02:41:54.890]  I mean, I know a lot of celebrities and these are two super genuine guys compared to most celebrities.
[02:41:54.890 --> 02:41:56.732]  I mean, just so real.
[02:41:56.732 --> 02:41:58.334]  And it's not just one time.
[02:41:58.334 --> 02:41:59.936]  You know, they didn't just come on your show one time.
[02:41:59.936 --> 02:42:01.959]  They keep pressing the issue.
[02:42:01.959 --> 02:42:04.782]  And there continues to be other people that aren't just celebrities.
[02:42:04.782 --> 02:42:05.243]  For instance,
[02:42:06.384 --> 02:42:06.765]  Who is it?
[02:42:06.765 --> 02:42:10.849]  The Japanese parliamentary member, what is it, Fujita, I believe his name is?
[02:42:10.849 --> 02:42:11.130]  Yeah.
[02:42:11.130 --> 02:42:19.459]  He just went again and did a 25-minute speech before Parliament on 9-11 Truth, and he keeps pressing that issue in Japan, and that is very important.
[02:42:19.459 --> 02:42:21.021]  And he's one of the top leaders in his party.
[02:42:21.141 --> 02:42:22.722]  That's right, and it's the opposition party.
[02:42:22.722 --> 02:42:29.846]  It's one of the two main parties over there, and for him to get up in front of those politicians and say what he's saying is so beneficial to our movement.
[02:42:29.846 --> 02:42:35.610]  It gives us a global credibility that we're going to need to topple these tyrants, you know?
[02:42:35.610 --> 02:42:39.032]  We need more people in governments around the world to start talking about this.
[02:42:39.032 --> 02:42:41.473]  We need more celebrities to start talking about this.
[02:42:41.473 --> 02:42:49.038]  We need more mainline talk show hosts to start talking about this stuff, and I think Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson, Charlie Sheen,
[02:42:49.318 --> 02:42:52.959]  Rosie O'Donnell, these are great ways to get it out, because they do have that influence.
[02:42:52.959 --> 02:43:00.980]  And it creates a big media circus, which then people hear about 9-11 Truth, they hear about government-sponsored terror, and by expose, well that was seven years ago.
[02:43:00.980 --> 02:43:09.081]  If we don't expose 9-11, at least in the public mind, you know, much less convictions, then they will continue to carry it out over and over again.
[02:43:09.081 --> 02:43:10.802]  They continue to use it to take your freedoms.
[02:43:10.802 --> 02:43:13.842]  That's right, and it's not like 9-11 is an isolated incident.
[02:43:13.842 --> 02:43:17.783]  We know the 7-7 bombings in Europe, in London,
[02:43:19.062 --> 02:43:23.847]  Head drills going on at the same exact time of the same exact train stations being blown up.
[02:43:23.847 --> 02:43:25.249]  I mean, is that a coincidence, Alex?
[02:43:25.249 --> 02:43:27.031]  Of course it's not a coincidence.
[02:43:27.031 --> 02:43:33.759]  And the real key to that not being a coincidence, and this being more state-sponsored terror to control people, to instill fear in people,
[02:43:34.259 --> 02:43:36.662]  To grab onto your liberties and freedoms.
[02:43:36.662 --> 02:43:54.142]  You had a member of these drills, a member of Visor Consultants, Peter Power, someone who was not in the loop, getting on Sky Television and the BBC, and new listeners can check this out, saying that the hair on the back of his neck is standing up right now because at the exact same time they were running drills of blowing up the exact same train stations.
[02:43:54.562 --> 02:43:58.945]  And the BBC kind of follows up on it and goes, that is an incredible coincidence!
[02:43:58.945 --> 02:44:01.367]  He's like, yes, it is an incredible coincidence!
[02:44:01.367 --> 02:44:16.637]  And then last year, because of people like you and myself, We Are Change, which is now a global institution, I mean, if you want it, you got it, you can go up to a politician, you can go up to somebody who is a corporate entity, you can go up to one of these elites and ask a question.
[02:44:16.637 --> 02:44:20.760]  We Are Change Ireland, in a country far, far away, finds Peter Powers,
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:26.863]  Asks him who he's going to run the drills for, who he was running the drills for, and the man walks into a closet, Alex.
[02:44:26.863 --> 02:44:28.144]  He walks not into another room.
[02:44:28.144 --> 02:44:28.864]  He was hiding.
[02:44:28.864 --> 02:44:30.045]  In a closet!
[02:44:30.045 --> 02:44:35.628]  If that doesn't scream guilt, and that's just, those are just two instances that we can prove in the last two years.
[02:44:35.628 --> 02:44:48.196]  By the way, Nis has had to admit now that the North Tower didn't fall into the South Tower, didn't knock out 25 to 30 percent of it, but Jesse's doing, well I don't want to get into it, the point is he's going around confronting all these people, and they're still just spewing the same bull.
[02:44:48.536 --> 02:44:49.036]  That's right.
[02:44:49.036 --> 02:44:49.416]  That's right.
[02:44:49.416 --> 02:44:50.537]  It's the same talking point.
[02:44:50.537 --> 02:44:52.578]  Man, I know so much I can't talk about here.
[02:44:52.578 --> 02:44:54.699]  Well, you know, I mean, I still... A lot of exciting stuff.
[02:44:54.699 --> 02:44:56.900]  I still get those talking points, too.
[02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:00.582]  Oh, 25% of the back face of World Trade Center 7 was scooped out.
[02:45:00.582 --> 02:45:01.783]  And we have video.
[02:45:01.783 --> 02:45:02.443]  And it's not!
[02:45:02.443 --> 02:45:04.184]  We have video inside the building!
[02:45:04.184 --> 02:45:05.965]  And now NIST has retracted that.
[02:45:05.965 --> 02:45:06.845]  Yeah, they absolutely have.
[02:45:06.845 --> 02:45:13.728]  And now these big firms, institutions, and big architecture institutes are coming out and saying, we've read your report, this is impossible.
[02:45:13.728 --> 02:45:14.149]  Yeah.
[02:45:14.149 --> 02:45:16.490]  I mean, again, the debunkers
[02:45:17.785 --> 02:45:21.708]  Count on people being stupid and not looking deeper.
[02:45:21.708 --> 02:45:26.131]  They just count on putting out disinformation and that isn't working anymore.
[02:45:26.131 --> 02:45:28.332]  No, that's absolutely right.
[02:45:28.332 --> 02:45:31.054]  Let me give you an example of what they do.
[02:45:31.054 --> 02:45:34.036]  They just make a claim that is completely untrue and then run with it.
[02:45:34.036 --> 02:45:40.801]  For instance, one of the big debunkers claims is that the military drills that morning immediately ended as soon as the real attacks happened.
[02:45:41.081 --> 02:45:41.941]  And they just spew this.
[02:45:41.941 --> 02:45:43.162]  They give no evidence.
[02:45:43.162 --> 02:45:44.703]  But we have the NORAD tapes, Alex.
[02:45:44.703 --> 02:45:46.964]  These drills went on all morning long.
[02:45:46.964 --> 02:45:49.225]  At least through Flight 93 going down.
[02:45:49.225 --> 02:45:53.828]  And then when they called into Cheyenne Mountain, it took another 20 to 25 minutes for them to shut these drills down.
[02:45:53.828 --> 02:45:54.808]  That's all morning.
[02:45:54.808 --> 02:45:56.669]  That's not 845 they stopped.
[02:45:56.669 --> 02:46:03.212]  But that doesn't matter, because whenever I talk to a debunker, they say right away, Oh, well they put those drills on hold at 845.
[02:46:03.212 --> 02:46:03.613]  That ended.
[02:46:03.613 --> 02:46:04.513]  That's not real.
[02:46:04.513 --> 02:46:06.214]  There was no hijacking drills that morning.
[02:46:06.474 --> 02:46:15.679]  When you can look at the NORAD games, Vigilant Guardian, Vigilant Warrior, Apollo Guardian, Global Guardian, and they're running live hijack drills.
[02:46:15.679 --> 02:46:27.805]  They're running a mass Armageddon exercise where E4Bs, in other words, mobile command centers for the quote-unquote shadow government or continuity of government program, just happen to be on the scene of the attacks.
[02:46:27.805 --> 02:46:33.148]  Now Burmese, I want to add something here before we get into some other news and take phone calls before Celica Stello joins us.
[02:46:33.988 --> 02:46:36.509]  You're wanting to do a radio show again.
[02:46:36.509 --> 02:46:40.231]  You've been so busy making Fabled Enemies that you quit your Genesis show for a while.
[02:46:40.231 --> 02:46:44.713]  And we're moving into the other studio, but I don't have the people hired to do the video in.
[02:46:44.713 --> 02:46:46.574]  You're going to do a show over Genesis.
[02:46:46.574 --> 02:46:48.535]  I have no desire to get involved with the radio network.
[02:46:48.535 --> 02:46:49.836]  I'm so tired of people telling me that.
[02:46:49.836 --> 02:46:50.616]  There's no way!
[02:46:51.096 --> 02:46:55.700]  I would try to get involved in managing all those personalities and dealing with all of it, but I want to get your show back on Genesis.
[02:46:55.700 --> 02:47:01.905]  It will also be streamed on PrisonPlanet.tv, and so look for that in the next few months.
[02:47:01.905 --> 02:47:03.006]  You're building your studio.
[02:47:03.006 --> 02:47:06.689]  You're going to have a nice little area there and do a two-hour show.
[02:47:06.689 --> 02:47:10.613]  We're not sure about what time to do it.
[02:47:10.613 --> 02:47:18.339]  We had talked about this in the past, so Jason Bermas will be coming back on the airwaves in the next few months, but let's not procrastinate forever and then not have it happen.
[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:26.004]  The other variant of that, it's also going to be on the web at PrisonPlanet.tv and you're building a TV studio.
[02:47:26.004 --> 02:47:28.125]  The screens behind you, you know, video feeds.
[02:47:28.125 --> 02:47:29.646]  I'm very, I'm blessed, Alex.
[02:47:29.646 --> 02:47:38.291]  And then our new studio, you know, not just for the TV show I'm going to do nationally, that's only one hour a week starting, then also do, you know, web reports from the nice setup and everything.
[02:47:38.291 --> 02:47:40.272]  But we're going to have a studio for radio.
[02:47:40.272 --> 02:47:46.836]  It's got little robotic cameras and a big back screen and curtains and just going to have a podium too where I can give speeches or have announcements.
[02:47:47.276 --> 02:47:48.557]  I mean, it's pretty kick-butt.
[02:47:48.557 --> 02:47:53.401]  I really believe we're going to give the mainstream media a hell of a run for their money, and they're not even going to see it coming.
[02:47:53.401 --> 02:47:54.482]  I mean, I really do.
[02:47:54.482 --> 02:48:00.847]  I mean, our studios are going to look slick, hopefully our presentation is going to be bigger than ever, and more people are going to be pulled into this, Alex.
[02:48:00.847 --> 02:48:02.648]  I mean, you've done so much already.
[02:48:02.648 --> 02:48:08.673]  And folks, we would do this faster, but when you're busy working 16, 17 hours, I mean, more or less.
[02:48:08.673 --> 02:48:10.234]  Hell, last night I got up at 7.
[02:48:11.235 --> 02:48:15.499]  When we had breakfast with Inter, we went there and got ready and met him for breakfast at 9.
[02:48:15.499 --> 02:48:20.263]  But I got up at like really 6.30, left the house at 7, came and met with you guys at 8.
[02:48:20.263 --> 02:48:24.427]  And then last night I dropped him off at 12.30 and we came back here to the office to work some more.
[02:48:24.427 --> 02:48:25.928]  Then I went home.
[02:48:25.928 --> 02:48:26.509]  A 20 hour day?
[02:48:26.509 --> 02:48:27.389]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:27.389 --> 02:48:30.012]  And then I couldn't help myself, I had to go look up
[02:48:30.852 --> 02:48:34.294]  This Dean Berkley, a Berkley candidate on the web.
[02:48:34.294 --> 02:48:37.515]  I mean, literally, we're burning with the passion for liberty and freedom.
[02:48:37.515 --> 02:48:39.096]  And people ask how we can work so much.
[02:48:39.096 --> 02:48:40.036]  Because we have passion.
[02:48:40.036 --> 02:48:41.917]  And folks, you've got that same passion.
[02:48:41.917 --> 02:48:43.898]  You've just got to put it into effect in small ways.
[02:48:43.898 --> 02:48:44.438]  It will build.
[02:48:44.438 --> 02:48:47.480]  Whether you're a radio show online that has 10 listeners or a million, you know.
[02:48:49.144 --> 02:48:53.306]  The point is taking action or using AXS TV or Micro-FM.
[02:48:53.306 --> 02:48:56.648]  More people need to put up Micro-FM and put on some of these networks.
[02:48:56.648 --> 02:48:59.930]  I mean there's so much, but you were talking about something when I interrupted you.
[02:48:59.930 --> 02:49:00.830]  No, that's okay Alex.
[02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:04.252]  I mean, again, I really think we're going to give the mainstream media a run for their money.
[02:49:04.252 --> 02:49:05.573]  I think we're going to be slick.
[02:49:05.573 --> 02:49:12.937]  You've done such a great job with your PrisonPlanet.tv fourth hour on the air show in the last, what's only been on, what about six, seven months, not even?
[02:49:13.137 --> 02:49:13.437]  Yeah.
[02:49:13.437 --> 02:49:14.477]  I mean, that's so huge.
[02:49:14.477 --> 02:49:18.878]  I mean, you see it every day and it's getting 10, 15, 20,000 hits on YouTube.
[02:49:18.878 --> 02:49:19.839]  That's awesome.
[02:49:19.839 --> 02:49:20.479]  Yeah, let's explain.
[02:49:20.479 --> 02:49:22.819]  The members get the live stream and the higher quality.
[02:49:22.819 --> 02:49:23.820]  Without it, we couldn't operate.
[02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:26.620]  You folks aren't just getting the higher quality streams and videos.
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:28.201]  You are making it possible here.
[02:49:28.201 --> 02:49:31.301]  And then we love the members ripping and getting it all over the map.
[02:49:31.301 --> 02:49:33.142]  But the great guy over at the Alex Jones Channel,
[02:49:34.122 --> 02:49:34.843]  Which is not us.
[02:49:34.843 --> 02:49:36.284]  I mean, we're not control freaks.
[02:49:36.284 --> 02:49:38.687]  He tried to, you know, give us the channel and we were like, you know.
[02:49:38.687 --> 02:49:43.372]  But the more I think about it, maybe we should, just so some other cretin doesn't get in and attack us, because, you know, that's how it works.
[02:49:43.372 --> 02:49:49.458]  But the guy's real nice, but this morning I got an email, literally no sleep, three and a half hours, I'm in here stumbling around before the show, like an hour before.
[02:49:50.138 --> 02:49:55.181]  And we see his email saying, hey guys, you know, you didn't post my latest videos.
[02:49:55.181 --> 02:49:57.482]  I mean, yeah, it's just Kurt Nemo over at InfoWars.
[02:49:57.482 --> 02:49:58.803]  We're overwhelmed.
[02:49:58.803 --> 02:50:04.846]  And that's what I feel bad about, is that our own supporters, people that email me, and I'm not bashing him, he's a great guy.
[02:50:04.846 --> 02:50:05.686]  He works so hard.
[02:50:05.686 --> 02:50:07.727]  He posts like 10, 15 videos a day.
[02:50:07.727 --> 02:50:09.909]  And thank you, Alex Jones Channel guy.
[02:50:09.909 --> 02:50:12.270]  I don't even have time to call him up on the phone and thank him.
[02:50:12.270 --> 02:50:14.431]  I don't have time to hardly see my family anymore.
[02:50:14.431 --> 02:50:16.792]  And I'm going to say this, we're almost done with the studios.
[02:50:16.792 --> 02:50:18.013]  I'm going to have to take some time off.
[02:50:18.513 --> 02:50:19.494]  Just to be with my family.
[02:50:19.494 --> 02:50:23.377]  My children are getting big and I'm seeing them two hours a day.
[02:50:23.377 --> 02:50:26.219]  I'm kind of tired today, so I'm just kind of brainstorming and babbling.
[02:50:26.219 --> 02:50:27.900]  The point is to all of you, we appreciate you.
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:29.641]  We just can't respond to the emails and everything.
[02:50:29.641 --> 02:50:30.202]  There's not many of us.
[02:50:30.202 --> 02:50:34.245]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[02:50:34.245 --> 02:50:39.248]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings accounts?
[02:50:39.248 --> 02:50:44.252]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[02:50:45.393 --> 02:50:45.833]  I think so.
[02:51:15.333 --> 02:51:16.734]  It's a question of when.
[02:51:16.734 --> 02:51:22.037]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.

[02:51:25.139 --> 02:51:27.581]  1-866-323-5665.
[02:51:27.581 --> 02:51:36.807]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:36.807 --> 02:51:38.488]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:40.981]  But who is the enemy?
[02:51:40.981 --> 02:51:41.782]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:41.782 --> 02:51:42.782]  This is his M.O.
[02:51:42.782 --> 02:51:44.123]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:51:44.123 --> 02:51:46.124]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:51:46.124 --> 02:51:53.289]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:51:53.289 --> 02:51:53.769]  Some U.S.
[02:51:53.769 --> 02:51:59.433]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:00.113 --> 02:52:03.994]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:03.994 --> 02:52:14.096]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:14.096 --> 02:52:15.316]  Fabled enemies.

[02:52:29.958 --> 02:52:31.639]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:52:31.639 --> 02:52:33.381]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:52:33.381 --> 02:52:41.207]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:52:41.207 --> 02:52:44.389]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:53:21.922 --> 02:53:22.883]  Never sung along to this song.
[02:53:22.883 --> 02:53:23.083]  Stingray!
[02:53:23.083 --> 02:53:23.303]  Stingray!
[02:53:47.117 --> 02:53:51.281]  The last bumper music was Jimmy Vaughn.
[02:53:51.281 --> 02:53:54.083]  I got to see him play it live last night on the stage, Alex.
[02:53:54.083 --> 02:53:54.884]  How great was that?
[02:53:54.884 --> 02:53:56.965]  I know we're going to put some of that up there too, Jimmy Vaughn.
[02:53:56.965 --> 02:53:58.987]  Yeah, we did an interview with him in Ventura.
[02:53:58.987 --> 02:53:59.707]  Yeah.
[02:53:59.707 --> 02:54:00.488]  He was a really nice guy.
[02:54:00.488 --> 02:54:02.470]  Yeah, they're great, great people.
[02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:06.493]  And his wife, Robin.
[02:54:06.493 --> 02:54:09.235]  Oh my goodness.
[02:54:09.235 --> 02:54:10.496]  We got Celica Stillo coming up.
[02:54:10.496 --> 02:54:11.477]  That really bums me out.
[02:54:11.477 --> 02:54:12.418]  We'll have him on at the 8 after.
[02:54:13.593 --> 02:54:15.994]  Set up by the Feds.
[02:54:15.994 --> 02:54:17.234]  Three-year conviction.
[02:54:17.234 --> 02:54:18.695]  Is that what they just sent us?
[02:54:18.695 --> 02:54:22.256]  Yeah, I got that fun email this morning.
[02:54:22.256 --> 02:54:24.037]  It's hard enough just to read all these emails.
[02:54:24.037 --> 02:54:26.038]  And Trey's in there reading them as fast as he can.
[02:54:26.038 --> 02:54:29.939]  Aaron's in there trying to read them in between web mastering and posting videos.
[02:54:29.939 --> 02:54:30.800]  And doing everything else.
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:32.340]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:33.881]  I was trying to explain before the break.
[02:54:33.881 --> 02:54:36.182]  We are limited.
[02:54:36.182 --> 02:54:39.003]  I mean, there's one, two, three
[02:54:41.843 --> 02:54:47.810]  There's really three people who full-time or even part-time deal with video here.
[02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:52.335]  And then I've got, in this office, two people that can do web stuff.
[02:54:52.335 --> 02:54:54.138]  And then I've got the two Watsons.
[02:54:54.138 --> 02:54:54.798]  And we've got Kurt.
[02:54:55.700 --> 02:55:01.421]  And I mean, in the bigger office, we can now get a few extra people to try to go over all this stuff.
[02:55:01.421 --> 02:55:05.702]  I'm just, all the time I get emails going, when I email my senator, I get a response back.
[02:55:05.702 --> 02:55:07.002]  I'm not getting a response back from you folks.
[02:55:07.002 --> 02:55:08.202]  We don't have it.
[02:55:08.202 --> 02:55:13.523]  Now, I'll say this, we have another Bonnie Bomb called, answer all the emails, respond to all the phone calls, Bonnie Bomb.
[02:55:13.523 --> 02:55:16.504]  But in a way, I don't think that's, I mean, I know I'm missing a lot of calls.
[02:55:16.504 --> 02:55:21.925]  I mean, when Charlie Sheen tried to get in contact with me, he tried to get in contact with me for a month, until we finally got his email and saw it.
[02:55:25.663 --> 02:55:29.464]  You know, it's the same thing with so many other people that I've missed.
[02:55:29.464 --> 02:55:32.845]  I mean, I've run into celebrities that are like, I tried to contact you three years ago.
[02:55:32.845 --> 02:55:34.206]  You know, so we do need to be able to go through everything.
[02:55:34.206 --> 02:55:36.006]  But at the same time, I don't even know why I'm getting off into this.
[02:55:36.006 --> 02:55:37.687]  It's just I make the point time and time again.
[02:55:37.687 --> 02:55:39.748]  I see so many people get mad that we can't respond.
[02:55:39.748 --> 02:55:42.709]  Or we can't cover every event.
[02:55:42.709 --> 02:55:44.729]  They think it's like a conspiracy.
[02:55:44.729 --> 02:55:46.550]  You know, folks, I am literally...
[02:55:47.689 --> 02:55:48.989]  Dizzy right now, I'm so tired.
[02:55:48.989 --> 02:55:52.870]  Yeah, I mean, I just got an email the other day about this Rothschild situation.
[02:55:52.870 --> 02:56:00.311]  Apparently one of the younger Rothschilds wrote a big letter to the editor in Europe accusing the shadow chancellor over there and Mendelsohn.
[02:56:00.311 --> 02:56:01.112]  Yeah, that's in the press.
[02:56:01.112 --> 02:56:04.152]  Yeah, of taking illegal contributions from this Russian billionaire.
[02:56:04.152 --> 02:56:06.212]  And the guy's like, well, why aren't you guys covering it?
[02:56:06.212 --> 02:56:07.073]  It sounds suspicious to me.
[02:56:07.073 --> 02:56:11.353]  I'm like, look man, there's only the BBC America in this, in this network.
[02:56:11.353 --> 02:56:12.434]  No, you just told us.
[02:56:12.434 --> 02:56:13.154]  Yeah, you just told us.
[02:56:13.154 --> 02:56:14.354]  We don't see that in our media.
[02:56:14.454 --> 02:56:21.801]  In fact, we need you to email us stories and links and news, because there are probably a tenth of my emails are, why are you covering this up?
[02:56:21.801 --> 02:56:28.046]  It's something that happened two hours ago, or a day ago, and I'm like, uh... Sometimes it could be a week and we miss it.
[02:56:28.046 --> 02:56:28.987]  I mean, we're not perfect.
[02:56:28.987 --> 02:56:31.249]  We're human beings like everybody else, Alex.
[02:56:31.249 --> 02:56:34.812]  I mean, we're not perfection, you know, and we need more people.
[02:56:34.812 --> 02:56:35.673]  We're far from it.
[02:56:35.673 --> 02:56:36.994]  Are you kidding?
[02:56:36.994 --> 02:56:37.775]  Far from it.
[02:56:37.775 --> 02:56:40.097]  Look at these eyes.
[02:56:40.097 --> 02:56:40.638]  Far from...
[02:56:42.992 --> 02:56:43.932]  Far from perfection.
[02:56:43.932 --> 02:56:47.653]  I was basically going through clouds of smoke yesterday.
[02:56:47.653 --> 02:56:52.154]  It wasn't any second-hand willy weed.
[02:56:52.154 --> 02:56:53.335]  I'm just joking.
[02:56:53.335 --> 02:56:54.995]  I'm just joking.
[02:56:54.995 --> 02:57:00.957]  I'm just joking.
[02:57:00.957 --> 02:57:02.757]  You know how it is when you're out at the willy land.
[02:57:02.757 --> 02:57:04.818]  I mean, how cool is it that he hangs out on this tour bus?
[02:57:04.818 --> 02:57:06.498]  I mean, he's literally, you know, you hear that.
[02:57:06.498 --> 02:57:08.278]  No, he walked on the bus and nothing was going on.
[02:57:08.278 --> 02:57:09.219]  It was like layers.
[02:57:12.626 --> 02:57:13.707]  It's just crazy to me, man.
[02:57:13.707 --> 02:57:16.449]  I mean, it's literally like an old smoke-filled bar, but it wasn't cigarettes.
[02:57:16.449 --> 02:57:18.852]  And it wasn't even really a decked-out bus, you know, Willie?
[02:57:18.852 --> 02:57:21.274]  Willie, again, just totally honest.
[02:57:21.274 --> 02:57:22.756]  It looked like my grandmother's kitchen.
[02:57:22.756 --> 02:57:24.297]  Yeah, it's like salt to the earth.
[02:57:24.297 --> 02:57:25.118]  Like, yeah, literally.
[02:57:25.118 --> 02:57:27.160]  Like his house is just one big kitchen.
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:28.662]  Everybody really lives in their kitchen.
[02:57:28.662 --> 02:57:28.782]  Yeah.
[02:57:28.942 --> 02:57:31.585]  And if I ever had the money for a really big house, that's what I'd have.
[02:57:31.585 --> 02:57:35.050]  I'd have a house with a huge kitchen, built on the living room.
[02:57:35.050 --> 02:57:36.872]  Yeah, and it was a gorgeous house.
[02:57:36.872 --> 02:57:37.793]  Again, very modest.
[02:57:37.793 --> 02:57:38.914]  I'd never seen that construction.
[02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:43.801]  People will see little clips of it, but they actually had like cut wood trees in the cement.
[02:57:43.801 --> 02:57:46.043]  It was really... Yeah, that's the German style.
[02:57:46.043 --> 02:57:46.904]  Very cool.
[02:57:46.904 --> 02:57:47.685]  Yeah, those are really great.
[02:57:48.652 --> 02:57:50.193]  Alright, we have really babbled here.
[02:57:50.193 --> 02:58:01.757]  You know, you ought to go, because I'm going to have Costello on for about 30 minutes with us, you ought to go pull, later during the break, I want you with us, you ought to go pull that particular Rothschild story, because I saw that, I think yesterday morning, I never got to it.
[02:58:01.757 --> 02:58:06.019]  This is the first time I've been back on air, so we'll cover that too coming up.
[02:58:06.019 --> 02:58:07.340]  I've got a bunch of other news, stay with us.

[02:59:50.825 --> 02:59:53.847]  We've got someone like Estello coming up, and we've got Jason Bermas riding shotgun.
[02:59:53.847 --> 02:59:56.308]  This will be a big news blitz I haven't covered yet.
[02:59:56.308 --> 03:00:00.489]  At the end of the show I covered some of it, but about two-thirds of the stack is still here.
[03:00:00.489 --> 03:00:02.750]  Vital info on a host of issues.
[03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:04.851]  One of these articles alone I could spend all day.
[03:00:04.851 --> 03:00:08.073]  The mainstream news now admitting everything we warned them about for the last 13 years.
[03:00:09.093 --> 03:00:13.535]  It's all Pentagon design, face scanning, retina scanning, thumb printing everywhere to buy and sell.
[03:00:13.535 --> 03:00:15.175]  It's going to go in everywhere.
[03:00:15.175 --> 03:00:17.516]  The license plate scanners are following you.
[03:00:17.516 --> 03:00:19.036]  They want you to know now.
[03:00:19.036 --> 03:00:24.398]  Your walk, AI computer systems watching everything you do from the time you leave your home, everything you purchase.
[03:00:24.398 --> 03:00:25.799]  I mean, just no Fourth Amendment.
[03:00:25.799 --> 03:00:27.239]  Total microscope.
[03:00:27.239 --> 03:00:28.139]  Total tyranny.
[03:00:28.139 --> 03:00:32.501]  While the government makes everything they do, like the criminal banker takeover, bailout, secret.
[03:00:33.021 --> 03:00:37.366]  And the White House Press Secretary says, well, we just need to trust our Treasury Secretary.
[03:00:37.366 --> 03:00:40.690]  I mean, folks, it is just, they are going for broke, Burmese.
[03:00:40.690 --> 03:00:44.274]  Yeah, and they're integrating new systems all the time.
[03:00:44.274 --> 03:00:48.899]  You know, I have my little price chopper card to get my discount because I can't get anything on sale anymore.
[03:00:48.899 --> 03:00:49.780]  They can make you carry the cart.
[03:00:49.780 --> 03:00:54.325]  They actually use that to war game to figure out what people can't, it's a complex algorithm to screw you.
[03:00:54.545 --> 03:00:58.006]  And even better now, Alex, they have now teamed up with Sunoco.
[03:00:58.006 --> 03:01:02.307]  So now when I use my card, I get 10, 20, 30 cents off gas.
[03:01:02.307 --> 03:01:03.808]  So now they get me twice.
[03:01:03.808 --> 03:01:06.288]  Alright, now if I go shopping... They're linking databases.
[03:01:06.288 --> 03:01:07.809]  Absolutely linking databases.
[03:01:07.809 --> 03:01:08.929]  And how can you not do it?
[03:01:08.929 --> 03:01:10.850]  I mean, you know you're going to shop there anyway.
[03:01:10.850 --> 03:01:11.990]  You know gas is over $3 a gallon.
[03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:13.151]  How can you not do it, Marmos?
[03:01:13.151 --> 03:01:14.691]  You're so worldly.
[03:01:14.691 --> 03:01:17.272]  I know it's tough, but... You just buy into everything they do.
[03:01:17.272 --> 03:01:21.613]  I'm saying, for the average person, groceries have gone up, gas has gone up.
[03:01:21.633 --> 03:01:23.334]  Because they know how to grit us now.
[03:01:23.334 --> 03:01:27.157]  It's all psychological system, warfare system to destroy us.
[03:01:27.157 --> 03:01:29.498]  And I know, and I get caught up in these systems.
[03:01:29.498 --> 03:01:35.883]  I mean, Alex, my two choices in my town is I can go to the Walmart, which is total Chinese slave labor.
[03:01:35.883 --> 03:01:37.304]  Everybody should go out and see Walmart.
[03:01:37.304 --> 03:01:39.965]  The high cost, the low price is a real eye-opener.
[03:01:39.965 --> 03:01:41.326]  You live in rural upstate New York.
[03:01:41.326 --> 03:01:43.288]  Yeah, or I can go to Price Chopper.
[03:01:43.288 --> 03:01:44.688]  Now, I can either
[03:01:45.549 --> 03:01:57.764]  Give my money to these slave masters at Walmart, or I can give my money to these new control masters at Price Chopper, who are now not only tracking what I eat and buy... Well, if you're going to do it, you should at least give them this info name.
[03:01:57.764 --> 03:01:58.204]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:01:58.204 --> 03:01:59.446]  I don't use my own card, actually.
[03:01:59.446 --> 03:02:01.368]  I use one of my college friends' little card.
[03:02:02.259 --> 03:02:02.819]  That is true.
[03:02:02.819 --> 03:02:15.146]  Now let me tell you, when I found this out 11 years ago in federal documents, we covered them on air at the time, I don't even remember what they were now, but you can go pull it up, you'll find that everything I tell you is documented, but today my memory's not working too well.
[03:02:15.146 --> 03:02:19.528]  The point is, it said they're going to have a national sales tax, but they're going to keep the income tax, they're just going to rename it.
[03:02:19.528 --> 03:02:22.350]  So all these fair tax, fair tax, yeah folks, just wait.
[03:02:22.350 --> 03:02:22.850]  Fine.
[03:02:22.850 --> 03:02:24.451]  Believe that I'm lying and just find out.
[03:02:25.271 --> 03:02:25.751]  You want it?
[03:02:25.751 --> 03:02:26.051]  Fine.
[03:02:26.051 --> 03:02:26.952]  Just, you know what?
[03:02:26.952 --> 03:02:27.552]  Have it.
[03:02:27.552 --> 03:02:29.333]  I told you the banks were hoarding all the money.
[03:02:29.333 --> 03:02:30.333]  Now it's mainstream news.
[03:02:30.333 --> 03:02:31.294]  You're not going to get any of it.
[03:02:31.294 --> 03:02:33.154]  All you're going to get is a barrel in the mouth from some idiot.
[03:02:33.154 --> 03:02:34.855]  And that's New York Times today, by the way.
[03:02:34.855 --> 03:02:35.495]  Yeah, I know.
[03:02:35.495 --> 03:02:38.737]  But the point here is, is that, I don't even care anymore.
[03:02:38.737 --> 03:02:39.717]  Why should I tell them?
[03:02:39.717 --> 03:02:46.680]  The point is, they're getting you ready to show your ID and thumbprint to buy and sell for a national sales tax, because it's going to be graduated.
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:48.581]  They're going, oh, it's fair if you're poor, you won't pay.
[03:02:49.241 --> 03:03:00.690]  That's only at first, and they're going to track everything you do, then they're going to have social workers come after you saying you're eating unhealthy food, environmental police, it's going to be carbon credits, it's all official, it's all... it's hell, okay?
[03:03:00.690 --> 03:03:01.271]  It's hell.
[03:03:01.271 --> 03:03:08.317]  And that'll even tie into Codex Alimentarius, which you discussed really briefly earlier, where they're literally trying to now regulate what we eat.
[03:03:08.877 --> 03:03:10.938]  You know, there's no end to it, Burma!
[03:03:10.938 --> 03:03:11.798]  There isn't an end.
[03:03:11.798 --> 03:03:22.882]  And Codex Alimentarius, I encourage people out there to go look into it, because there really has not been a mainstream work, or even a non-mainstream work, an alternative work that's gone big.
[03:03:22.882 --> 03:03:25.003]  And this is something people need to know about.
[03:03:25.003 --> 03:03:27.203]  They're trying to put this legislation through in 2011 or 2012 at the latest.
[03:03:29.444 --> 03:03:32.667]  And I think it's scary that the government's... Well, a lot of that's red herring.
[03:03:32.667 --> 03:03:35.730]  They're already putting in Codex Alimentarius under other names.
[03:03:35.730 --> 03:03:37.672]  They're already cracking down on vitamin makers and others.
[03:03:37.672 --> 03:03:41.836]  Of course, there's a few bad apples, a few bad examples, but they won't even regulate vitamin C and stuff.
[03:03:41.836 --> 03:03:43.738]  They're already doing it at the state level.
[03:03:43.738 --> 03:03:44.699]  They're threatening
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:49.942]  Well, we're at the tip of the spear, Alex, and we just gotta keep pressing forward, man, and trying to take this Goliath down.
[03:04:09.329 --> 03:04:10.190]  We don't have a choice.
[03:04:10.190 --> 03:04:14.254]  They're building a psychological, technological, enslavement grid.
[03:04:14.254 --> 03:04:16.717]  They say that's what it is.
[03:04:16.717 --> 03:04:18.779]  And... Katie, bar the door.
[03:04:18.779 --> 03:04:20.981]  Because, I mean, these people are a bunch of eugenicists.
[03:04:20.981 --> 03:04:22.042]  Look at Paulson.
[03:04:22.042 --> 03:04:23.784]  He's the Nature Conservancy former head.
[03:04:23.784 --> 03:04:25.005]  He admits he's anti-human.
[03:04:25.005 --> 03:04:26.687]  I mean, they hate us, man.
[03:04:26.687 --> 03:04:28.409]  They hate us!
[03:04:28.409 --> 03:04:30.071]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:30.071 --> 03:04:32.053]  Ask yourself, is there a natural way to...
[03:04:34.088 --> 03:04:34.809]  Oh, God.
[03:04:34.809 --> 03:04:41.892]  Well, we're at the tip of the spear, Alex, and we just gotta keep pressing forward, man, and trying to take this Goliath down.
[03:04:41.892 --> 03:04:46.815]  We don't have a choice, and they're building a psychological, technological enslavement grid.
[03:04:46.815 --> 03:04:49.276]  They say that's what it is.
[03:04:49.276 --> 03:04:53.539]  And they bar the door, because, I mean, these people are a bunch of eugenicists.
[03:04:53.539 --> 03:04:54.599]  Look at Paulson.
[03:04:54.599 --> 03:04:56.320]  He's the Nature Conservancy former head.
[03:04:56.320 --> 03:04:58.061]  He admits he's anti-human.
[03:04:58.061 --> 03:04:59.242]  I mean, they hate us, man.
[03:04:59.242 --> 03:05:00.923]  They hate us.
[03:05:00.923 --> 03:05:01.583]  We're at work.
[03:05:02.569 --> 03:05:14.472]  Ask yourself, is there a natural way to detoxify your body, lower blood pressure, remove heavy metals and sediment buildup in your body, alkalize and balance your pH level, and lower those cravings for junk food all at once?

[03:05:58.910 --> 03:06:05.793]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[03:06:05.793 --> 03:06:09.275]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:09.275 --> 03:06:11.937]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:11.937 --> 03:06:13.477]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:13.477 --> 03:06:14.258]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:14.258 --> 03:06:15.238]  This is his MO.
[03:06:15.238 --> 03:06:16.639]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:16.639 --> 03:06:18.080]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:25.765]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:25.765 --> 03:06:26.245]  Some U.S.
[03:06:26.245 --> 03:06:32.609]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:32.609 --> 03:06:36.112]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:36.112 --> 03:06:46.598]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:46.598 --> 03:06:47.319]  Fabled Enemies.
[03:06:47.799 --> 03:06:58.961]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[03:07:05.095 --> 03:07:06.877]  Here's a startling fact.
[03:07:06.877 --> 03:07:08.918]  The New World Order wants you dead.
[03:07:08.918 --> 03:07:10.940]  Chemicals and toxins are in the air.
[03:07:10.940 --> 03:07:12.081]  Bio-warfare.
[03:07:12.081 --> 03:07:14.203]  Drugs and unknown substances.
[03:07:14.203 --> 03:07:15.924]  Foods with no vitamins.
[03:07:15.924 --> 03:07:17.926]  Fast food for obesity.
[03:07:17.926 --> 03:07:19.607]  Fluoride in our water!
[03:07:19.607 --> 03:07:20.568]  How do we fight back?
[03:07:21.008 --> 03:07:22.169]  What do we do?
[03:07:22.169 --> 03:07:23.729]  Make a life change decision.
[03:07:23.729 --> 03:07:25.010]  Get ahead of the curve.
[03:07:25.010 --> 03:07:26.711]  Get the T dot com.
[03:07:26.711 --> 03:07:29.772]  That's get the T dot com.
[03:07:29.772 --> 03:07:32.853]  Cleanse your body and internal organs.
[03:07:32.853 --> 03:07:34.814]  Lose weight and receive more energy.
[03:07:34.814 --> 03:07:39.456]  Get aboard the life change boat and say no to losing their job.
[03:07:39.456 --> 03:07:41.437]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[03:07:41.437 --> 03:07:42.537]  Banks are going bust.
[03:07:42.537 --> 03:07:45.098]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[03:07:45.098 --> 03:07:46.719]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[03:07:46.719 --> 03:07:49.260]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[03:07:50.928 --> 03:07:51.769]  We know.
[03:07:51.769 --> 03:07:53.450]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[03:07:53.450 --> 03:07:54.892]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[03:07:54.892 --> 03:08:04.441]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[03:08:04.441 --> 03:08:06.483]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[03:08:07.108 --> 03:08:08.049]  They're crazy.
[03:08:08.049 --> 03:08:11.452]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[03:08:11.452 --> 03:08:18.417]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[03:08:18.417 --> 03:08:22.961]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[03:08:22.961 --> 03:08:24.042]  Just leave us alone.
[03:08:24.042 --> 03:08:26.284]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[03:08:26.284 --> 03:08:27.365]  I want you to get mad!
[03:08:28.564 --> 03:08:29.645]  I don't want you to protest.
[03:08:29.645 --> 03:08:30.686]  I don't want you to riot.
[03:08:30.686 --> 03:08:33.989]  I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[03:08:33.989 --> 03:08:38.633]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[03:08:38.633 --> 03:08:41.616]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[03:08:41.616 --> 03:08:43.738]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[03:08:43.738 --> 03:08:46.561]  My life has value!
[03:08:46.561 --> 03:08:50.024]  I want you to get up now.
[03:08:50.024 --> 03:08:52.106]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[03:08:53.377 --> 03:09:03.800]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as bad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:07.121]  I want you to get up right now.
[03:09:07.121 --> 03:09:17.504]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'm as bad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[03:09:25.553 --> 03:09:34.166]  I'm as fine as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[03:09:34.166 --> 03:09:37.752]  Well, I wish we could have him on under better circumstances.
[03:09:37.752 --> 03:09:39.414]  You know, again, our listeners.
[03:09:40.646 --> 03:09:41.446]  We didn't used to do it a lot.
[03:09:41.446 --> 03:09:43.367]  We do it more and more trying to help people in distress.
[03:09:43.367 --> 03:09:49.251]  He raced quite a bit for his defense but not enough and obviously it was a rigged game.
[03:09:49.251 --> 03:09:52.993]  So now I guess he's going to try to appeal or going away for three years.
[03:09:52.993 --> 03:09:57.255]  So look at Stello who was an Army sniper in Vietnam.
[03:09:57.255 --> 03:09:58.416]  He was then a Sheriff's Deputy.
[03:09:59.452 --> 03:10:19.979]  uh... down on the border he then was a DEA agent uh... you know the head guy down there over quite a few uh... in central south america and mexico witnessed government drug dealing and shipping narcotics in the united states of alopengo and others and uh... selly uh... likes to go to gun shows and sell his book powder burns but I remember going back uh... must have been like
[03:10:21.604 --> 03:10:28.687]  Now, when I first interviewed Shelly and talked to her about eight years ago, and then Kevin Booth made the Drug War film, it's been on national television, and they really got mad.
[03:10:28.687 --> 03:10:30.768]  They even mentioned that when they set him up and arrested him.
[03:10:30.768 --> 03:10:33.149]  Oh, the guy on TV.
[03:10:33.149 --> 03:10:39.851]  That's been, won a bunch of awards, been on Showtime, and incidentally we have that video available on DVD at InfoWars.com, American Drug War.
[03:10:39.851 --> 03:10:41.492]  It's two hours long with three hours of extra.
[03:10:41.492 --> 03:10:44.813]  It's really like five hours, five hour film.
[03:10:44.813 --> 03:10:47.334]  But Shelly got shut up.
[03:10:47.334 --> 03:10:48.135]  So Shelly, why don't you
[03:10:48.895 --> 03:10:54.397]  Well, you know, from the get-go, Alex, I knew that I hadn't done anything illegal, and I complained to the agents about it.
[03:11:18.126 --> 03:11:19.147]  And so forth.
[03:11:19.147 --> 03:11:22.928]  And my attorney brought this to the attention of the U.S.
[03:11:22.928 --> 03:11:23.829]  Attorney's Office.
[03:11:23.829 --> 03:11:25.990]  And they said, no, no, no.
[03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.690]  He's guilty.
[03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:28.171]  He's going to do this and that.
[03:11:28.171 --> 03:11:36.675]  Well, bottom line, Alex, seven months later, on October 1st, the government dismissed my case.
[03:11:36.675 --> 03:11:37.976]  Completely.
[03:11:37.976 --> 03:11:39.877]  Under Polk v. U.S.
[03:11:39.877 --> 03:11:42.318]  And I wasn't a prohibited person.
[03:11:42.318 --> 03:11:44.119]  And what I was doing was not against the law.
[03:11:45.896 --> 03:11:53.401]  When I went up there before to get my charges dropped, well, Lord and behold, a U.S.
[03:11:53.401 --> 03:11:57.885]  prosecutor comes out with two new charges.
[03:11:57.885 --> 03:12:03.869]  And it's selling guns without a license, and then evading and selling licenses without a license.
[03:12:03.869 --> 03:12:08.412]  So it really is double jeopardy because, I mean, it's not the classic double jeopardy, but it is.
[03:12:08.412 --> 03:12:11.995]  You're found not, it's thrown out, and so they just slap more on you.
[03:12:12.662 --> 03:12:13.742]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[03:12:13.742 --> 03:12:18.284]  They realized they made a mistake, and basically what happened, they weren't about to let me go.
[03:12:18.284 --> 03:12:21.364]  Well, let's go back to the original case, how they set you up.
[03:12:21.364 --> 03:12:23.425]  I mean, you're not some big gun dealer.
[03:12:23.425 --> 03:12:25.245]  You're allowed to have private sales.
[03:12:25.245 --> 03:12:26.186]  Well, exactly.
[03:12:26.186 --> 03:12:31.807]  You know, I was at the gun shows, and I was, you know, doing like what half of the vendors do at the gun shows, you know.
[03:12:31.807 --> 03:12:34.748]  Well, it's like you told me about four years ago when I saw you at the gun show.
[03:12:34.748 --> 03:12:37.709]  I said, oh, last time I didn't see you selling guns, and you had two or three on the table.
[03:12:38.129 --> 03:12:45.851]  You said, yeah, I can't even afford to drive around Texas a few times a month as a school teacher, the gas, to sell five or six books.
[03:12:45.851 --> 03:12:50.952]  So just to be here and educate the public, you know, I might sell and trade as a collector.
[03:12:50.952 --> 03:12:52.492]  I mean, you're a gun guy.
[03:12:52.492 --> 03:12:54.073]  Your dad was a World War II hero.
[03:12:54.073 --> 03:12:57.414]  You're a cop, a sniper, a DEA guy.
[03:12:57.414 --> 03:12:59.794]  I mean, you know, we're allowed to go and sell guns here.
[03:12:59.794 --> 03:13:00.854]  I mean, come on.
[03:13:00.854 --> 03:13:01.354]  Exactly.
[03:13:01.354 --> 03:13:07.436]  So anyway, Alex, to make a long story short, I left the courtroom on the 1st and I called my mom.
[03:13:08.035 --> 03:13:09.816]  Just 84 years old, Alex.
[03:13:09.816 --> 03:13:15.000]  And, you know, she said, you know, son, you probably could beat this case if you wanted to, but you know what?
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.022]  It's going to take forever and I don't have that long.
[03:13:17.022 --> 03:13:20.885]  And if you do lose, you know, you'll be going away for about seven years.
[03:13:20.885 --> 03:13:23.346]  So I won't be around and I want you to be out.
[03:13:23.346 --> 03:13:26.509]  So I went back in there and I pled guilty to the two counts.
[03:13:26.509 --> 03:13:28.450]  It was a five year count each.
[03:13:28.450 --> 03:13:31.672]  So that was it, you know.
[03:13:31.672 --> 03:13:35.836]  And then I come up to sentences on the 22nd of this month and
[03:13:37.108 --> 03:13:46.333]  I put my letters in like everybody else has, professors, law enforcement guys, professors, you name it.
[03:13:46.333 --> 03:13:51.396]  I put about eight letters in there, a character reference, which were great.
[03:13:51.396 --> 03:14:01.262]  I went up there and the judge said that he was going to sentence me to the minimum of the guidelines for 37 months.
[03:14:01.262 --> 03:14:04.984]  He didn't take it for granted my post-traumatic stress disorder or anything else like that.
[03:14:05.697 --> 03:14:09.779]  You know, and I wrote him a letter also and I said, you know, whatever it is, it is.
[03:14:09.779 --> 03:14:14.362]  And, you know, I need to, uh, uh, if you're going to sentence me, then fine.
[03:14:14.362 --> 03:14:17.143]  And I argued my points.
[03:14:17.143 --> 03:14:19.905]  I had five issues I needed to argue on him and I did.
[03:14:19.905 --> 03:14:27.549]  And, um, basically he, um, he objected to all of them and sentenced me to 37 years.
[03:14:27.549 --> 03:14:32.852]  I mean, to 37 months in a, um, uh, medical facility, Alex.
[03:14:33.927 --> 03:14:41.448]  So I'll be in a medical facility somewhere for three years, and I'm trying to get my attorney.
[03:14:41.448 --> 03:14:44.489]  Well, thank God you're not going to be in general population.
[03:14:44.489 --> 03:14:47.149]  Well, that's the big plus on it, Alex.
[03:14:47.149 --> 03:14:52.330]  And you know, the thing about it is I got to appeal my sentence, and I got ten days to do that.
[03:14:52.330 --> 03:15:00.012]  And if anybody can help me, just go to my email address, which is powderburnsatprodigy.net, and I'll email you right back.
[03:15:01.843 --> 03:15:12.870]  I believe in the judicial system, and for some reason, I got nothing.
[03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:15.772]  I'm 59 years old, Alex.
[03:15:15.772 --> 03:15:17.353]  Never been in trouble before in my life.
[03:15:17.353 --> 03:15:24.017]  20 years of federal law enforcement, being a teacher, being an activist, being everything that I could have done for my country.
[03:15:26.215 --> 03:15:26.835]  I got 37 months.
[03:15:26.835 --> 03:15:27.235]  I know Alex.
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:57.063]  No, Selly, we appreciate you, but I want to try to explain something to people here.
[03:15:57.063 --> 03:16:06.407]  Selly sounds very resigned now to this, and you know, he's a real man and a real hero and a patriot, but he's not even telling you today what he told you six months ago or five months ago here on the show.
[03:16:06.407 --> 03:16:09.309]  He was clearly set up, just like Randy Weaver,
[03:16:10.349 --> 03:16:14.851]  This person kept coming to him saying, please buy these thirteen guns or whatever the number was.
[03:16:14.851 --> 03:16:17.392]  Please, please, please, I'll give you a deal almost for nothing.
[03:16:17.392 --> 03:16:18.272]  And Sully needs money.
[03:16:18.272 --> 03:16:20.813]  I mean, Sully's living in a trailer, taking care of his kids.
[03:16:20.813 --> 03:16:23.354]  A school teacher in South Texas makes almost nothing.
[03:16:23.354 --> 03:16:24.554]  He's medically disabled.
[03:16:24.554 --> 03:16:27.895]  You know, he's been in all this combat over and over again.
[03:16:27.895 --> 03:16:31.657]  And I mean, I happen to know, you know, Sully doesn't have a lot of money.
[03:16:31.657 --> 03:16:35.958]  And so, you know, well yeah, I'll take these guns and sell them.
[03:16:35.958 --> 03:16:37.819]  You know, that's totally legal, but it's how they
[03:16:38.499 --> 03:16:39.660]  Yeah, well basically, that's what it was.
[03:16:39.660 --> 03:16:40.600]  You know, the guy who sold me the guns,
[03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:06.531]  It was an individual who did the straw purchases.
[03:17:06.531 --> 03:17:14.917]  You know, Alex, he was never arrested until a few months ago because I threatened to address the issue with the judge, and they went out and arrested him.
[03:17:14.917 --> 03:17:20.441]  But I don't know if they'll dismiss the case on him now or not.
[03:17:20.441 --> 03:17:27.807]  You know, I would feel that they probably would do that because he set me up and got me.
[03:17:27.807 --> 03:17:31.410]  But, you know, he's the individual who actually did the straw purchases.
[03:17:32.077 --> 03:17:32.898]  And not me.
[03:17:32.898 --> 03:17:35.440]  And he sold them to me and I just sold the guns.
[03:17:35.440 --> 03:17:53.973]  And bottom line is, I beat him on the first thing and now I need to go back and file the appeal on my sentencing, which is... You know, I had two hours' argument with the judge and he gave me, I think, some pretty good leeway on evidence for appeal.
[03:17:53.973 --> 03:18:01.339]  And if I do appeal that, I'll probably go down to maybe ten levels on the federal guidelines, which means I would qualify for probation.
[03:18:01.690 --> 03:18:02.591]  Well, let's be clear here.
[03:18:29.841 --> 03:18:31.001]  And I've looked at these cases.
[03:18:31.001 --> 03:18:35.882]  Normally somebody is selling a couple of, quote, guns that were straw purchased at gun shows.
[03:18:35.882 --> 03:18:36.602]  You hadn't even done that.
[03:18:36.602 --> 03:18:38.022]  You had them at your house.
[03:18:38.022 --> 03:18:38.323]  Right.
[03:18:38.323 --> 03:18:42.943]  I mean, you're talking about maybe probation, maybe plea bargain down to nothing.
[03:18:42.943 --> 03:18:46.904]  I mean, hardcore murderers are spending, you know, a couple years in prison.
[03:18:46.904 --> 03:18:49.484]  Home invasion people are spending six months a lot of times.
[03:18:49.484 --> 03:18:54.425]  But here you are with this sparkling record, commendations from President George H.W.
[03:18:54.425 --> 03:18:55.125]  Bush.
[03:18:55.125 --> 03:18:56.866]  It's like they threw the book at Campos and
[03:18:58.226 --> 03:19:09.617]  The problem with that, Alex, to me this is a death sentence because of my health issues.
[03:19:09.617 --> 03:19:11.859]  Whether it's one year or two years or three years.
[03:19:11.859 --> 03:19:16.503]  I went up there and I looked for a headstone already.
[03:19:16.503 --> 03:19:18.165]  And I went up there and I did my obituary.
[03:19:18.772 --> 03:19:20.897]  Because I don't think I'm going to survive those three years.
[03:19:30.510 --> 03:19:31.751]  On September 11, 2000.
[03:19:31.751 --> 03:19:33.532]  They almost kill them in prison.
[03:19:33.532 --> 03:19:35.233]  They love burning cops, man.
[03:19:35.233 --> 03:19:42.037]  The problem with that, Alex, that I will... To me, this is a death sentence because of my health issues.
[03:19:42.037 --> 03:19:44.798]  Whether it's one year or two years or three years, you know.
[03:19:44.798 --> 03:19:48.921]  I went up there and I looked for a headstone already.
[03:19:48.921 --> 03:19:50.582]  And I went up there and I did my obituary.
[03:19:51.162 --> 03:19:53.923]  Because I don't think I'm going to survive those three years.
[03:19:53.923 --> 03:19:55.423]  You have a lot of medical problems.
[03:19:55.423 --> 03:19:56.844]  If you want to talk about those, people know.
[03:19:56.844 --> 03:19:58.544]  We can talk about them on the other side.
[03:19:58.544 --> 03:20:02.906]  Be right back with some of Costello and Jason Berman.
[03:20:02.906 --> 03:20:08.627]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:20:08.627 --> 03:20:09.968]  And we knew what to do.
[03:20:09.968 --> 03:20:11.948]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:20:11.948 --> 03:20:18.290]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:20:19.002 --> 03:20:27.888]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:20:27.888 --> 03:20:34.972]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:20:34.972 --> 03:20:38.034]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:20:38.034 --> 03:20:43.218]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:20:43.918 --> 03:20:46.999]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:20:46.999 --> 03:20:52.921]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:20:52.921 --> 03:20:55.962]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:20:55.962 --> 03:21:00.883]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:21:02.287 --> 03:21:04.389]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.729]  October 27, 2008.
[03:21:04.729 --> 03:21:05.811]  Gold opened this morning at $714.80.
[03:21:05.811 --> 03:21:08.974]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $737.26, $368.63 for half ounce, and $184.31 for quarter ounce.
[03:21:08.974 --> 03:21:09.775]  That's $737.26, $368.63, and $184.31.
[03:21:20.465 --> 03:21:26.027]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[03:21:26.027 --> 03:21:30.288]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[03:21:30.288 --> 03:21:38.131]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[03:21:38.131 --> 03:21:40.492]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[03:21:40.772 --> 03:21:44.536]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[03:21:44.536 --> 03:21:50.782]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[03:21:50.782 --> 03:21:54.025]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[03:21:54.025 --> 03:21:57.048]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[03:21:57.048 --> 03:21:57.308]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:57.308 --> 03:21:57.489]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:02.569 --> 03:22:06.273]  Everyone knows that Omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:22:06.273 --> 03:22:12.020]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:22:12.020 --> 03:22:16.345]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:22:16.345 --> 03:22:17.306]  Nature's Gem.
[03:22:17.506 --> 03:22:18.787]  Premium Omega-3.
[03:22:18.787 --> 03:22:30.172]  Unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around.
[03:22:30.172 --> 03:22:38.876]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flax seeds by size and weight, keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of Omega-3.
[03:22:38.876 --> 03:22:42.238]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[03:22:42.238 --> 03:22:43.999]  Nature's Gem Golden Flax is pure,
[03:22:44.279 --> 03:22:44.639]  We're good to go.
[03:23:03.226 --> 03:23:06.909]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?
[03:23:06.909 --> 03:23:08.591]  Then do something about it!
[03:23:08.591 --> 03:23:14.196]  Fuel Saver's Fuel Conditioner lets you drive further on each gallon of fuel, completely safe for all engines.
[03:23:14.196 --> 03:23:23.685]  Just add a small squeeze of product to your tank each time you fill up to improve your fuel economy 10% to 20% or more, saving you $0.35 to $0.80 on every gallon.
[03:23:23.685 --> 03:23:25.026]  Each little 2-ounce squeeze bottle
[03:23:25.026 --> 03:23:26.507]  Well, Shelly's a great guy.
[03:23:26.507 --> 03:23:30.390]  He was just thanking the listeners to me during the break without the $5,000 or whatever it was.
[03:23:30.390 --> 03:23:31.331]  I'm surprised it wasn't more.
[03:23:45.657 --> 03:23:45.837]  I think?
[03:24:00.987 --> 03:24:17.955]  When the stupid state policeman here in Texas doesn't know that Danny Romero that does his website for him and Celica Stillo and all the people that are exposing the phony drug war are just out there taking a risk to do that.
[03:24:17.955 --> 03:24:20.276]  The website of course is PowderBurns.com
[03:24:22.445 --> 03:24:32.656]  Yeah, PowderBurns.org, and I take a risk saying this, I take a risk doing this here on air.
[03:24:32.656 --> 03:24:37.342]  The other people, like Danny and others that have supported, Sully, take a risk, Sully.
[03:24:38.042 --> 03:24:40.064]  You know, took a huge risk and got all sorts of threats.
[03:24:40.064 --> 03:24:45.068]  I remember you, two years ago on the show, saying, I've had threats, they're telling me they're going to set me up.
[03:24:45.068 --> 03:24:50.472]  And we're going to keep you over and talk about your appeal and how folks can help you and the medical issues.
[03:24:50.472 --> 03:24:55.637]  But, I mean, I want people to understand what you've gone through in this saga, exposing government drug dealing.
[03:24:55.637 --> 03:24:56.677]  Celica Stillo.
[03:24:56.677 --> 03:25:03.483]  Yeah, well, you know, I've exposed it from the get-go, from the human rights violations by the CIA down in Central America.
[03:25:04.170 --> 03:25:07.111]  And a lot of people will say, well, that happened back in the 80s.
[03:25:07.111 --> 03:25:09.311]  Why is the issue still going on?
[03:25:09.311 --> 03:25:22.494]  Well, what a lot of people don't realize, Alex, is the same people that were at the White House at that time period are still working at the White House, like Negro Ponte and Abrams and other people there.
[03:25:22.494 --> 03:25:24.855]  They're still running this administration.
[03:25:24.855 --> 03:25:29.276]  And it's very important because they're using the same blueprints that they used back in the 80s.
[03:25:30.769 --> 03:25:31.069]  I think so.
[03:25:55.146 --> 03:25:55.647]  I don't know.
[03:26:13.906 --> 03:26:17.127]  And thank God I didn't get hurt.
[03:26:17.127 --> 03:26:21.248]  You're saying the police, when they threw you back in there, let you keep your knife?
[03:26:21.248 --> 03:26:30.189]  Yes, not only that, they let me keep my $200 I had in my pocket and I was not given my medication.
[03:26:30.189 --> 03:26:33.370]  Although they did have my medication, but they didn't give it to me.
[03:26:33.370 --> 03:26:42.752]  So I felt that I was being set up to get whacked or killed or whatever because this is a federal facility.
[03:26:43.263 --> 03:26:45.704]  I mean, how is it possible that they didn't search me?
[03:26:45.704 --> 03:26:54.669]  And I kept waiting for them to, you know, search me and do everything they had to do, but I just... And I called them several times and they just kept saying, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:26:55.239 --> 03:26:57.860]  Oh, you told him, take my knife!
[03:26:57.860 --> 03:27:04.641]  Well, I didn't want to say that because then the other guys would have probably tried to rush me, tried to get the knife from me, you know?
[03:27:04.641 --> 03:27:05.502]  Oh, I understand.
[03:27:05.502 --> 03:27:09.963]  Yeah, tell us about the second arrest, because the judge throws out the first one.
[03:27:09.963 --> 03:27:12.263]  Explain why that setup was thrown out.
[03:27:12.263 --> 03:27:18.505]  Well, it was set up because there's a case law called Polk v. U.S.
[03:27:18.505 --> 03:27:23.446]  and they basically charged me with the wrong count and my attorney beat that and
[03:27:24.248 --> 03:27:33.913]  Uh, finally they told them that they were going to have to dismiss the case, but, uh, they would not dismiss my case until I pled out to the two new counts.
[03:27:33.913 --> 03:27:41.276]  So it was, uh, I didn't even have time to, uh, to read the whole, uh, agreement that I was, that I was playing out to.
[03:27:41.276 --> 03:27:51.121]  And, uh, um, and the reason that I, one of the other reasons that I pled out was because the youth attorney told me, if you plead out to this, you will not lose your benefit.
[03:27:51.121 --> 03:27:52.582]  And then he addressed the court.
[03:27:53.157 --> 03:28:07.181]  Because the judge wanted to find out why the case was being dismissed and I was being charged with the other two and he stood up and he told the judge, you know, he's taking this plea because he won't lose his benefits with, you know, on this plea.
[03:28:07.679 --> 03:28:21.365]  Well, I just want to thank everybody that has helped you, all the listeners, Ted Anderson having you on, Kevin Booth exposing all the information that you brought forward, Danny Romero doing your website, everybody, but especially the listeners.
[03:28:21.365 --> 03:28:24.746]  When we come back, we've got a long segment, I want Burmese people to pop in.
[03:28:24.746 --> 03:28:28.488]  I want to talk about how people can write letters to the appeals court.
[03:28:29.288 --> 03:28:32.751]  Yes sir, it's Powder Burns, plural with an S, Powder Burns at Prodigy, P-R-O-D-I-G-Y dot net.
[03:28:53.777 --> 03:28:56.059]  Or you can call me at 956-345-5770.
[03:28:56.059 --> 03:28:58.061]  Once again, 956-345-5770.
[03:28:58.061 --> 03:29:16.056]  Alright, we're going to come back and get more into the case and where this is going, and then talk about government narcotics trafficking with that CIA aircraft a few months ago crashing with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine on a CIA aircraft.
[03:29:16.056 --> 03:29:17.097]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:17.097 --> 03:29:17.598]  Stay with us.
[03:29:17.598 --> 03:29:18.699]  Shelley Costello is our guest.
[03:29:20.219 --> 03:29:21.620]  We're on the march.
[03:29:21.620 --> 03:29:23.021]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:36.095 --> 03:29:48.178]  All right, we're going to come back and get more into the case and where this is going and then talk about government narcotics trafficking with that CIA aircraft a few months ago crashing with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine on a CIA aircraft.
[03:29:48.178 --> 03:29:49.478]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.478 --> 03:29:49.998]  Stay with us.
[03:29:49.998 --> 03:29:52.599]  Stella Costello is our guest.
[03:29:52.599 --> 03:29:53.559]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.559 --> 03:29:56.499]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.499 --> 03:29:59.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:04.395 --> 03:30:10.040]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:12.702]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[03:30:12.702 --> 03:30:16.345]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[03:30:16.345 --> 03:30:27.594]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size, and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[03:30:27.774 --> 03:30:31.236]  We offer a real solution using real science.
[03:30:31.236 --> 03:30:35.339]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[03:30:35.339 --> 03:30:38.821]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[03:30:38.821 --> 03:30:41.083]  Laser technology at its best.
[03:30:41.083 --> 03:30:44.285]  To receive an information packet, call our treatment center at 501-255-7000.
[03:30:46.587 --> 03:30:47.688]  We're good to go.
[03:31:02.598 --> 03:31:05.823]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[03:31:05.823 --> 03:31:09.307]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:31:09.307 --> 03:31:11.971]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:11.971 --> 03:31:13.513]  But who is the enemy?
[03:31:13.513 --> 03:31:14.314]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:14.314 --> 03:31:15.235]  This is his MO.
[03:31:15.235 --> 03:31:16.697]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:16.697 --> 03:31:17.258]  We have to look to...
[03:31:17.498 --> 03:31:17.758]  Some U.S.
[03:31:17.758 --> 03:31:20.862]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:31:32.635 --> 03:31:36.136]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:36.136 --> 03:31:38.936]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:32:02.532 --> 03:32:05.633]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:32:05.633 --> 03:32:11.135]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:32:11.135 --> 03:32:16.857]  Even a fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:32:16.857 --> 03:32:18.338]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:32:18.338 --> 03:32:27.241]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:32:27.521 --> 03:32:46.035]  I know we've got phone calls holding and somebody's going to leave us here in about 10 minutes.
[03:32:46.035 --> 03:32:47.055]  We'll go to your calls.
[03:32:47.055 --> 03:32:50.958]  Burmish, you want to run out and find that Rothschild clip you keep talking about so John can play it?
[03:32:50.958 --> 03:32:51.939]  You reminded me about that.
[03:32:54.935 --> 03:33:02.481]  Sally, what was it like to learn that another CIA aircraft crashed in Mexico with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine?
[03:33:02.481 --> 03:33:04.202]  And, of course, that means it's coming directly from the source.
[03:33:04.202 --> 03:33:09.085]  It turned out it was one of the torture aircraft the CIA was using for kidnapped people in the U.S.
[03:33:09.085 --> 03:33:12.288]  to fly them out of the country and fly drugs back in.
[03:33:12.288 --> 03:33:19.333]  I mean, did that surprise you to see that add to the list of hundreds of times that they've been caught with the cocaine and heroin in their hands?
[03:33:19.935 --> 03:33:23.717]  Well, no, not at all, because that's how they support their covert operation.
[03:33:23.717 --> 03:33:26.318]  That's how they did it in Central America.
[03:33:26.318 --> 03:33:31.341]  You know, they ran those drugs from South America into the U.S.
[03:33:31.341 --> 03:33:32.802]  for guns and brought them back.
[03:33:32.802 --> 03:33:39.465]  And, you know, you go back to the Vietnam War, Alex, you know, when they were smuggling heroin in body bags.
[03:33:39.465 --> 03:33:46.209]  So, you know, there have always been consistency in the evidence of our government being complicit in drug trafficking.
[03:33:46.209 --> 03:33:47.770]  So it didn't surprise me at all when I
[03:33:48.237 --> 03:33:48.397]  I don't
[03:34:04.524 --> 03:34:07.948]  Whether Mexico or Central America or back to Iraq.
[03:34:21.300 --> 03:34:35.260]  You also talked about thousands being killed every few months in Mexico, total drug war with CIA and bank-backed government, at war with real cartels that you said, from memory, about 20% of the business is theirs, 80% U.S.
[03:34:35.260 --> 03:34:35.460]  government.
[03:34:37.663 --> 03:34:40.945]  Yeah, what's coming in the future, Alex, is they're going to start taking out a lot of federal agents.
[03:35:07.485 --> 03:35:09.407]  For example, ATF.
[03:35:09.407 --> 03:35:20.396]  ATF has gone rogue warriors in the border here, and they're just arresting people, leaving the gun shows in this mess.
[03:35:20.396 --> 03:35:28.002]  And what's going to happen is they're going to start taking these guys out, because they buy the weapons here in the U.S.
[03:35:28.002 --> 03:35:29.603]  And you know what, Alex?
[03:35:29.603 --> 03:35:32.446]  The majority of the weapons are going into Mexico.
[03:35:32.446 --> 03:35:33.967]  They're going to the military.
[03:35:34.996 --> 03:35:40.901]  Because the military has now built what is known as paramilitary, just like they did in Colombia.
[03:35:40.901 --> 03:35:42.702]  They're building them in Mexico.
[03:35:42.702 --> 03:35:44.364]  So they're mercs.
[03:35:44.364 --> 03:35:48.187]  They're going out and having scrimmages with the cartels.
[03:35:48.187 --> 03:35:52.870]  So they need the weapons for their own organization.
[03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:54.732]  And basically that's what they're doing.
[03:35:54.732 --> 03:36:01.838]  Just remember that the military's got those 50 cals and so forth, and they're nothing compared to the cartels.
[03:36:02.994 --> 03:36:07.075]  The military is heavily, heavily involving drug trafficking to the U.S.
[03:36:07.075 --> 03:36:16.998]  and, you know, they ship, you know, a lot of weapons and a lot of money into Mexico via the border.
[03:36:16.998 --> 03:36:20.079]  And, of course, there's no exception.
[03:36:20.079 --> 03:36:31.183]  There's a couple of ATF agents that are on the payroll, a couple of, one FBI, I think, and several DEA agents who've been working for the cartels for many, many years, and they're still doing it.
[03:36:31.183 --> 03:36:32.283]  So they get intelligence.
[03:36:32.779 --> 03:36:38.743]  They know what's coming down the pipeline and who's being targeted and so forth.
[03:36:38.743 --> 03:36:47.448]  So, you know, it's very well organized, but there's a lot of competition and a lot of freelancers, and that's when people are getting whack.
[03:36:53.364 --> 03:36:54.385]  We just lost him.
[03:36:54.385 --> 03:36:58.486]  Let's get him back on the line there.
[03:36:58.486 --> 03:37:00.026]  That's why they don't want him out.
[03:37:00.026 --> 03:37:06.228]  By the way, he's been on Frontline, he's been on Nightline, he's been on Dateline.
[03:37:06.228 --> 03:37:07.769]  You can go to his website and see all those clips.
[03:37:12.421 --> 03:37:37.902]  It's just amazing that he's done all of this, went public, and he was there with Oliver North as they were loading the cocaine on the planes in El Pongo, and then I could have Terry Reid on, who was CIA, at MENA with Bill Clinton and all them, and he's there just kind of running, keeping the aircraft in order, he'd done that and been a pilot, he was one of the trainers for the new CIA guys, and he was watching the cocaine land on the other end.
[03:37:39.008 --> 03:37:40.489]  And this is pure cocaine.
[03:37:40.489 --> 03:37:42.870]  I mean, it's coming directly from the source.
[03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:46.212]  And what they do in Colombia is, and this is even on our news, the U.S.
[03:37:46.212 --> 03:37:49.674]  spray planes in the war on drugs only spray the communist-owned coca.
[03:37:50.558 --> 03:37:51.879]  They don't spray this side.
[03:37:51.879 --> 03:38:03.368]  And I've talked to, and it's been in the news as well, but a lot of troops separately, not just in the news, have been in Afghanistan where it's eight-fold what it was in 2001, and it's about double the previous record.
[03:38:03.368 --> 03:38:05.149]  It was only four-fold the previous record.
[03:38:05.149 --> 03:38:06.570]  So it's eight times.
[03:38:06.570 --> 03:38:10.433]  Heroin is just flooding Europe, flooding Asia, flooding the United States.
[03:38:10.433 --> 03:38:11.113]  Super cheap.
[03:38:11.113 --> 03:38:12.815]  Get everybody addicted.
[03:38:12.815 --> 03:38:15.337]  Just like the British brought down China that way.
[03:38:15.337 --> 03:38:19.320]  And I've talked to the troops who were there, and they say, yeah, we go and we guard
[03:38:20.367 --> 03:38:20.827]  Absolutely.
[03:38:20.827 --> 03:38:23.269]  You know, we go, I mean, Mexico and Colombia and Peru and Bolivia
[03:38:47.086 --> 03:38:56.692]  I remember at one time or another, we had the best satellite photos of all the coca plantations, the hectares and so forth, and we never sprayed them.
[03:38:56.692 --> 03:39:07.658]  We only sprayed a small amount to put on a Doc and Pony show, and every year we have a bigger production of cocaine coming into the U.S., and then heroin in Afghanistan, the same thing.
[03:39:07.658 --> 03:39:15.103]  Now we control Afghanistan, and we've got the biggest production harvest of heroin coming into the U.S., so it's going to tell you that
[03:39:15.874 --> 03:39:20.298]  The United States government is incomplicit in the drug trade.
[03:39:20.298 --> 03:39:21.759]  Simple as that.
[03:39:21.759 --> 03:39:25.663]  I mean, how much more obvious selling Estella does it have to get for people?
[03:39:25.663 --> 03:39:33.730]  Well, basically what happens now, Alex, it's now one in three of the immediate families are either using or selling drugs.
[03:39:33.730 --> 03:39:37.614]  So it's affecting the families and it's destroying the families.
[03:39:37.614 --> 03:39:40.076]  And basically that's why we have a lot of
[03:39:41.342 --> 03:39:48.746]  One parent family, you know, and their parents are going to jail, and their brothers and uncles are going to jail.
[03:39:48.746 --> 03:39:54.049]  I knew gorgeous girls, smart, you know, best in school, turned into total crack whores.
[03:39:54.049 --> 03:39:58.192]  You know, I knew, I had great friends, handsome, smart football players, ruined.
[03:39:58.192 --> 03:40:09.198]  And the amount of poison that's in illegal drugs, when you decriminalize it, all that poison isn't added to them, like the methamphetamine, it's the poison in it to make it, because they're using other ingredients.
[03:40:10.439 --> 03:40:15.163]  I mean, before drugs were illegal, this country was a lot better, weren't they?
[03:40:15.163 --> 03:40:16.804]  I mean, bottom line, Sully.
[03:40:16.804 --> 03:40:17.444]  Exactly.
[03:40:17.444 --> 03:40:18.866]  And, you know, we're continuing.
[03:40:18.866 --> 03:40:21.428]  That's why, you know, just remember one thing, Alex.
[03:40:21.428 --> 03:40:30.656]  We spend billions of dollars in forced countries like Colombia and Peru or Afghanistan to try to stop this so-called war on drugs.
[03:40:30.656 --> 03:40:31.636]  And it doesn't work.
[03:40:31.636 --> 03:40:32.857]  It has never worked.
[03:40:32.857 --> 03:40:35.079]  Law enforcement has never worked.
[03:40:35.079 --> 03:40:38.242]  We've got over 40 years of experience that has not worked.
[03:40:38.740 --> 03:40:45.085]  So the answer and the solution has got to be education, prevention and treatment.
[03:40:45.085 --> 03:41:04.041]  As a member of LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, we need to educate the public that we've got to do something to stop prohibition, especially on marijuana and so forth, because it's hurting a lot of people and our civil liberties are being stamped on.
[03:41:05.742 --> 03:41:06.983]  You're absolutely right, Shelly.
[03:41:06.983 --> 03:41:07.783]  Jason, jump in there.
[03:41:07.783 --> 03:41:08.484]  Jason Burrus.
[03:41:08.484 --> 03:41:29.775]  Yeah, you know, we were talking about the drug war with Jesse Ventura and it just made me think to make the point that they do like people convicted of smaller crimes, these smaller drug crimes, even marijuanas, criminalized, to put people in the system into their privatized prisons so they can work for AT&T or Sprint for 39 cents an hour at slave wages and not have to outsource to third world countries.
[03:41:29.775 --> 03:41:32.117]  So, for them, you know, it's a win-win.
[03:41:32.117 --> 03:41:33.958]  They're smuggling the stuff in dirt cheap,
[03:41:34.398 --> 03:41:40.244]  They're making a premium on it, and then the people that use it go to their privatized prisons to work slave labor for them.
[03:41:40.244 --> 03:41:41.886]  This system has to change, Alex.
[03:41:41.886 --> 03:41:45.249]  And then all these good old boys go, good, make them criminals work!
[03:41:45.249 --> 03:41:46.510]  But it's, it's, it's dry.
[03:41:46.510 --> 03:41:49.473]  I mean, you think somebody in India getting two bucks an hour is taking your job.
[03:41:49.473 --> 03:41:51.976]  You think somebody in Mexico making two bucks an hour is taking your job.
[03:41:51.976 --> 03:41:55.699]  Or here in the U.S., for four bucks, you know, some illegal immigrant.
[03:41:55.699 --> 03:41:56.600]  Well, forget them.
[03:41:57.521 --> 03:42:04.988]  The real threat to our jobs, and is the 4 million behind bars, another 4 million in the system, working for slave labor.
[03:42:04.988 --> 03:42:07.851]  And they make people work in these prisons.
[03:42:07.851 --> 03:42:13.156]  And people don't know, they're doing a lot of the telemarketing, they're booking flights for people.
[03:42:13.156 --> 03:42:15.038]  They are taking over the industries right now.
[03:42:16.132 --> 03:42:22.154]  Absolutely, and it's just incredible that the general populace is totally and completely ignorant to this fact.
[03:42:22.154 --> 03:42:30.137]  They really need to get involved and see what these private institutions are doing, how they interact with one another, and really how it is a control grid for the common man.
[03:42:30.137 --> 03:42:37.360]  You know, I had a couple friends, unfortunately, this year succumb to heroin addiction and have to go to rehab, and they're still struggling with it.
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:41.061]  These are people I would have never thought, Alex, and it's just crazy to me.
[03:42:41.061 --> 03:42:42.341]  And, you know, we're not out there to help them.
[03:42:42.341 --> 03:42:43.802]  We're really out there to imprison them.
[03:42:45.253 --> 03:42:49.915]  Well, I mean, the people shipping it in are the ones that are running the police, and there's no doubt of that.
[03:42:49.915 --> 03:42:50.656]  Everybody knows it.
[03:42:50.656 --> 03:42:51.456]  We're just tired of it.
[03:42:51.456 --> 03:42:53.557]  We're tired of your criminal activities.
[03:42:53.557 --> 03:42:57.139]  That's why I tell young people, don't ever use drugs that first time.
[03:42:57.139 --> 03:43:00.040]  And I'm not talking about a few beers or, you know, even somebody smoking marijuana.
[03:43:00.040 --> 03:43:02.981]  The problem is, that brings you into cultures.
[03:43:02.981 --> 03:43:06.203]  It is a gateway to the stronger drugs.
[03:43:06.203 --> 03:43:11.105]  And what kills more people is prescription drugs and the Ritalin and the Prozac than all illegal drugs combined.
[03:43:11.105 --> 03:43:11.905]  You can look at those numbers.
[03:43:11.905 --> 03:43:12.626]  It's just staggering.
[03:43:13.566 --> 03:43:15.228]  But, you know, alcohol is very dangerous.
[03:43:15.228 --> 03:43:17.290]  Cigarettes are dangerous.
[03:43:17.290 --> 03:43:19.492]  You know, thank God I never got into hard drugs.
[03:43:19.492 --> 03:43:21.934]  I tried them once or twice and always hated the way they made me feel.
[03:43:21.934 --> 03:43:23.976]  But I've struggled with alcohol, cigarettes.
[03:43:23.976 --> 03:43:27.319]  I mean, I have a serious issue with those because, I mean, I'm like a ping-pong.
[03:43:27.319 --> 03:43:29.381]  Not a lot of alcohol, but drink a few beers, smoke cigarettes.
[03:43:29.381 --> 03:43:30.282]  It's not good for me.
[03:43:30.282 --> 03:43:32.103]  You know, I get off of it, get back on it.
[03:43:32.103 --> 03:43:34.546]  So, I mean, imagine going to prison for cigarettes and beer.
[03:43:35.106 --> 03:43:48.792]  You know, but I mean, that's basically, because cigarettes affect the same areas of the brain and has the, you know, in a CAT scan, or a scan of the brain, it lights up the same areas as cocaine and heroin.
[03:43:48.792 --> 03:43:51.794]  Do we put cigarette smokers in prison?
[03:43:51.794 --> 03:43:52.674]  Sally?
[03:43:52.674 --> 03:43:53.314]  Yeah.
[03:43:53.314 --> 03:43:57.136]  You know, it's just, it's amazing how they're doing this.
[03:43:57.136 --> 03:44:03.679]  And you know, one of the things I think that you might have missed, Alex, is the fact that once you're a convicted felon, you don't vote.
[03:44:04.966 --> 03:44:10.308]  So that's a good way of trying to suppress a lot of the people from voting.
[03:44:10.308 --> 03:44:15.170]  They're also destroying the economy, so everybody's got to join the military, because that's all that's left is government jobs.
[03:44:15.170 --> 03:44:20.731]  That's all there's left, and a lot of people are getting hurt by going into the military.
[03:44:20.731 --> 03:44:25.773]  And remember, they're looking for survival, and hoping that they won't get hurt.
[03:44:25.773 --> 03:44:30.875]  And once they do get hurt, they lose a limb or something, then they know they commit suicide.
[03:44:31.144 --> 03:44:36.908]  Well, Selly, let's give out, you're saying the best place for people is to email you at this address.
[03:44:36.908 --> 03:44:39.570]  Right, at PowderBurnsAtProdigy.net.
[03:44:39.570 --> 03:44:51.299]  You can send me your donations there, because I do need to pay my attorney now, and I have to pay for that appeal on the sentencing, so if you please could help, and I would certainly appreciate it.
[03:44:51.299 --> 03:44:58.645]  And once again, you can go straight to my email address at PowderBurnsAtProdigy.net, or you can call me at 956-345-4000.
[03:45:01.087 --> 03:45:02.669]  I certainly do appreciate that the judge did give me that.
[03:45:25.165 --> 03:45:34.808]  Well, they know they're sending an innocent person to jail for fake gun laws put into place by the drug-dealing government, so they can imprison American citizens and have a reason to harass us.
[03:45:34.808 --> 03:45:37.749]  You know, Alex, I might be incarcerated, but I'll never be silent.
[03:45:37.749 --> 03:45:42.971]  You know, I'll do my activism from inside, and then when I get out, I'll do the same thing.
[03:45:42.971 --> 03:45:49.473]  I'll continue to educate the public, and basically that's the big answer to a lot of our problems.
[03:45:49.473 --> 03:45:52.134]  People are not aware of what's going on, whether it's
[03:45:52.970 --> 03:46:01.375]  with a drug issue or suppression of other stuff, but we need to educate the public and you're certainly doing a great job on that.
[03:46:01.375 --> 03:46:05.618]  Well, Sully, stay in touch with us as this unfolds and develops and thanks for getting in touch with us.
[03:46:05.618 --> 03:46:06.098]  Okay.
[03:46:06.098 --> 03:46:07.699]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[03:46:07.699 --> 03:46:09.280]  You bet.
[03:46:09.280 --> 03:46:10.541]  Sully, you still there?
[03:46:10.541 --> 03:46:10.941]  Okay, great.
[03:46:10.941 --> 03:46:11.261]  He's gone.
[03:46:11.261 --> 03:46:11.802]  I thought he hung up.
[03:46:13.140 --> 03:46:14.901]  Yeah, and again, when it rains, it pours.
[03:46:14.901 --> 03:46:18.303]  This day is like, help this senator out, you know, help Celica Stillo out.
[03:46:18.303 --> 03:46:20.664]  You know, that's so many people.
[03:46:20.664 --> 03:46:21.424]  We try to help.
[03:46:21.424 --> 03:46:24.826]  We try to be a platform and we ask the listeners for a lot.
[03:46:24.826 --> 03:46:33.691]  You know, I only ask the listeners to support our sponsors and get our books and videos because this is not cheap doing this and operating here.
[03:46:33.691 --> 03:46:36.513]  And I want to get into this Rothschild news and a few other news stories at the end of the show.
[03:46:36.513 --> 03:46:39.014]  It looks like we're not going to have time to get to those calls.
[03:46:39.014 --> 03:46:40.715]  And Burmese, let's just set this up now.
[03:46:42.438 --> 03:46:50.903]  Let's have you fill in a full day one day this week, and then maybe one or two hours the other day.
[03:46:50.903 --> 03:46:56.967]  Because I've got so much to get done, plus you're one of the few people out there who can really actually do the show well.
[03:46:56.967 --> 03:47:06.232]  We've had a lot of people fill in and do the show, have done a great job, but you hold the internet numbers for use as a gauge at the closest to what I'm able to hold them at, and we use that as a gauge.
[03:47:07.153 --> 03:47:19.164]  For the listeners, so that's certainly good to have you when you are here in town, and I can't wait to hear your studio set up up there in upstate New York, because then you can fill in on this show.
[03:47:19.164 --> 03:47:23.588]  And then maybe I'll have you some days when I'm out of town, and maybe Bob Dacey together or something.
[03:47:23.588 --> 03:47:26.310]  Go back and forth, that's a good mix.
[03:47:26.310 --> 03:47:30.434]  Speaking of funding, our sponsors are how we pay for this show.
[03:47:31.875 --> 03:47:38.442]  And we're going to go to break here in a minute, come back and hit a few final news stories, but I want to tell you on air about who does make this show possible.
[03:47:38.442 --> 03:47:43.307]  This is what supports us, and we appreciate you doing that, especially in these hard times.
[03:47:43.307 --> 03:47:45.670]  But the other thing is, I only get sponsors I believe in.
[03:47:47.023 --> 03:47:52.785]  And we have four big sponsors, eFoods Direct, Cola Blue, New Vitality, and Food Shortage USA.
[03:47:52.785 --> 03:47:54.186]  Let me tell you about eFoods Direct.
[03:47:54.186 --> 03:47:58.387]  They are the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[03:47:58.387 --> 03:48:00.588]  They are where I have chosen to get my storable foods.
[03:48:02.609 --> 03:48:04.671]  Bought food for other family that couldn't afford it.
[03:48:04.671 --> 03:48:06.072]  Yes, I really believe all this.
[03:48:06.072 --> 03:48:26.910]  I really believe they're setting up a depression and see it's all happening and I really believe the new world order is poisoning and killing us and see I happen to have the documents so I don't trust them and I know I'll never stand in a bread line because I have my own bread and I'm not going to the Superdome and I'm not going to a FEMA camp and it's my job to take care of my family so I've got food that'll last more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years climate controlled, high quality, freeze-dried and
[03:48:27.971 --> 03:48:31.633]  Also, dehydrated, so it's jam-packed in the cans.
[03:48:31.633 --> 03:48:34.994]  It's condensed, so a lot fits in a small place.
[03:48:34.994 --> 03:48:35.414]  800-409-5633.
[03:48:35.414 --> 03:48:35.514]  800-409-5633.
[03:48:35.514 --> 03:48:36.114]  Call and get a free...
[03:48:41.997 --> 03:48:45.719]  Brochure, a free catalog, or a free audio CD about what they have to offer, 800-409-5633.
[03:48:45.719 --> 03:48:52.604]  And Steve Schenck, the owner of the company, also has his own show from 6 to 8 p.m.
[03:48:52.604 --> 03:48:56.086]  Sunday nights after my Sunday, abbreviated two-hour program.
[03:48:56.086 --> 03:48:58.147]  You can also go to efoodsdirect.com.
[03:48:58.147 --> 03:49:01.069]  Then there's also a Cola Blue.
[03:49:01.069 --> 03:49:04.131]  This is the amazing atmospheric water generator.
[03:49:06.151 --> 03:49:08.133]  By the way, Willie has his own brand of these.
[03:49:08.133 --> 03:49:08.713]  They're really neat.
[03:49:08.713 --> 03:49:10.154]  Ventura couldn't believe it.
[03:49:10.154 --> 03:49:13.637]  Seven gallons or more, but in the desert about three gallons.
[03:49:13.637 --> 03:49:15.478]  A day with the basic unit.
[03:49:15.478 --> 03:49:17.700]  Very affordable atmospheric water generator for your home.
[03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:19.021]  Pays for itself in one year.
[03:49:19.021 --> 03:49:21.702]  If you buy your water from the store, pure clean water without the fluoride.
[03:49:22.948 --> 03:49:26.169]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air, 7.5 gallons a day.
[03:49:26.169 --> 03:49:28.591]  Rate tasting pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:49:28.591 --> 03:49:29.651]  Neutral pH.
[03:49:29.651 --> 03:49:32.312]  Then it goes through five other filters, so it's no fluoride.
[03:49:32.312 --> 03:49:33.473]  866-585-4044, 1-866-585-4044, or acolablue.com.
[03:49:33.473 --> 03:49:36.874]  I've had four hours to plug my sponsors, and I'm just so focused on the info.
[03:49:43.797 --> 03:49:45.138]  Never really plug the videos anymore.
[03:49:45.138 --> 03:49:46.559]  I need to plug Fabled Enemies.
[03:49:46.559 --> 03:49:47.379]  This week you can do it.
[03:49:47.379 --> 03:49:48.000]  That's a good film.
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:49.020]  Needs to get out there.
[03:49:49.020 --> 03:49:50.581]  But again at Coloblue.com.
[03:49:50.581 --> 03:49:53.944]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E-D-O-T-C-O-M.
[03:49:53.944 --> 03:49:58.226]  And in closing here with the sponsors, Food Shortage USA.
[03:49:58.226 --> 03:49:58.927]  Fabulous folks.
[03:49:58.927 --> 03:50:02.389]  They tell you how inexpensively in your own home to store food.
[03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:07.793]  They tell you the secrets to doing that.
[03:50:08.886 --> 03:50:11.428]  And it's FoodShortageUSA.com.
[03:50:11.428 --> 03:50:12.869]  FoodShortageUSA.com.
[03:50:12.869 --> 03:50:14.470]  Go check it out.
[03:50:14.470 --> 03:50:15.871]  They're not even selling food.
[03:50:15.871 --> 03:50:17.652]  It's literature and videos and materials.
[03:50:17.652 --> 03:50:18.353]  Learn that.
[03:50:18.353 --> 03:50:19.293]  FoodShortageUSA.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:50:19.293 --> 03:50:19.393]  877-327-0365.
[03:50:19.393 --> 03:50:20.194]  FoodShortageUSA.com.
[03:50:20.194 --> 03:50:20.894]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:20.894 --> 03:50:22.476]  I'm going to skip this break.
[03:50:30.641 --> 03:50:38.303]  You know what, we've had so much time here that I haven't even gotten to this and I don't want to not spend time on FoodShortageUSA.com, at least for the internet audience.
[03:50:38.303 --> 03:50:40.284]  I'm going to give them an extra plug here.
[03:50:40.284 --> 03:50:41.844]  Just great materials.
[03:50:41.844 --> 03:50:48.186]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family to prepare for the road ahead.
[03:50:48.186 --> 03:50:52.727]  The website reveals a step-by-step way for the average guy to get prepared for what's ahead.
[03:50:52.727 --> 03:50:58.509]  I think the best part about the system is it gets you off the food grid even if you don't have a lot of money to spend on this site.
[03:50:58.829 --> 03:51:01.251]  Again, it's FoodShortageUSA.com.
[03:51:01.251 --> 03:51:02.071]  It's not too late.
[03:51:02.071 --> 03:51:05.273]  You can still prepare by learning how to make your own survival foods.
[03:51:05.273 --> 03:51:07.155]  And you can do this for pennies a day.
[03:51:07.155 --> 03:51:08.255]  Our pennies on the dollar.
[03:51:08.255 --> 03:51:12.458]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:51:12.458 --> 03:51:17.782]  Hold off on that Rothschild thing until we get back to the full audience here at the end.
[03:51:17.782 --> 03:51:19.543]  A little bit dingy today.
[03:51:19.543 --> 03:51:23.285]  I had like three and a half hours sleep after two wild days with Jesse Ventura.
[03:51:23.285 --> 03:51:26.427]  And an afternoon with Willie Nelson.
[03:51:26.427 --> 03:51:28.249]  And an evening that was quite insane.
[03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:37.476]  You know, I got to this top story at the start of the show, and I really can't do justice to it.
[03:51:37.476 --> 03:51:42.600]  Senator predicts a revolution if banks don't lend, and Senator says that basically they're hoarding all the money.
[03:51:42.600 --> 03:51:47.343]  Senator Dodd, same thing we've said, that's in the New York Times, and Paul did a great story on it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:51:47.343 --> 03:51:48.264]  Burmish, your take on this?
[03:51:48.584 --> 03:51:50.465]  Well, obviously, I mean, what did they say?
[03:51:50.465 --> 03:51:58.992]  They gave their first $25 billion to Chase Manhattan, but they have no interest whatsoever in loaning out any of that money, and all they're going to do is recapitalize themselves.
[03:51:58.992 --> 03:52:00.673]  Well, that's not a shocker.
[03:52:00.673 --> 03:52:01.274]  You know, I know.
[03:52:01.274 --> 03:52:01.754]  Let's be clear.
[03:52:01.754 --> 03:52:02.775]  Gave them the money.
[03:52:02.775 --> 03:52:04.496]  These aren't just regular Federal Reserve loans.
[03:52:04.496 --> 03:52:05.437]  It's just, here, have it.
[03:52:05.437 --> 03:52:07.298]  Yeah, this is not a loan, folks.
[03:52:07.298 --> 03:52:11.782]  We gave them this money, and Chase Manhattan is not going down.
[03:52:11.782 --> 03:52:13.003]  Me and you both know that, Alex.
[03:52:13.003 --> 03:52:13.863]  This is a rock and roll.
[03:52:13.863 --> 03:52:14.664]  It's the kingpin.
[03:52:14.884 --> 03:52:15.284]  Yeah!
[03:52:15.284 --> 03:52:16.205]  They're running the whole show!
[03:52:16.205 --> 03:52:16.806]  Yeah, exactly!
[03:52:16.806 --> 03:52:19.608]  They're the biggest of the banks.
[03:52:19.608 --> 03:52:21.009]  They're not going anywhere.
[03:52:21.009 --> 03:52:23.411]  They're the last people that need this $25 billion.
[03:52:23.411 --> 03:52:27.695]  Why didn't that $25 billion, Alex, go to the local banks that do have a shot at going out?
[03:52:27.695 --> 03:52:29.536]  Going to the people that really need it the most.
[03:52:29.536 --> 03:52:30.777]  It didn't go there, did it?
[03:52:30.777 --> 03:52:32.719]  It went to this empire!
[03:52:32.719 --> 03:52:36.482]  And, you know, uh... I can't remember his name, but there's... It's also international.
[03:52:36.482 --> 03:52:37.503]  Most of it's going offshore.
[03:52:37.503 --> 03:52:38.403]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:52:38.403 --> 03:52:40.025]  And their tie, I think it's, uh...
[03:52:41.004 --> 03:52:46.125]  Man, I can't remember the name, but he's basically saying, yeah, we're going to recapitalize our banks.
[03:52:46.125 --> 03:52:48.325]  We really can't give out any new loans.
[03:52:48.325 --> 03:52:49.946]  I wouldn't expect that to happen.
[03:52:49.946 --> 03:52:52.846]  In fact, I would expect less loans to be going out.
[03:52:52.846 --> 03:52:53.666]  So here's how it works.
[03:52:53.666 --> 03:52:55.506]  We're going to get $5 trillion of your money.
[03:52:55.506 --> 03:52:57.707]  That's what they're admitting, and it's not $700 billion.
[03:52:57.707 --> 03:53:01.748]  We're going to get, you've heard Ron Paul say that, it's in Bloomberg as well, $5 trillion.
[03:53:01.748 --> 03:53:05.628]  And you can't even see who we're giving it to or see the secret contracts.
[03:53:05.628 --> 03:53:10.389]  And we're also paying around brokerage firms hundreds of billions of dollars at the end of the day to hand out the trillion.
[03:53:10.589 --> 03:53:17.846]  And not only will there never be any oversight over this bill, but it will never be able to be reviewed by any agency, anytime, anywhere, ever.
[03:53:17.846 --> 03:53:20.031]  And if Congress doesn't like it, they tell them publicly.
[03:53:20.908 --> 03:53:23.049]  North Com and the military standing by.
[03:53:23.049 --> 03:53:27.250]  You're going to stand here while we take all your money and destroy your future, and you're going to pay it all back in taxes.
[03:53:27.250 --> 03:53:34.152]  They get the money, we pay for it, and the tax man... I mean, there's more cops, more checkpoints, more tickets, more IRS grabbing houses.
[03:53:34.152 --> 03:53:37.473]  They are just going to squeeze us and squeeze us and squeeze us and squeeze us.
[03:53:37.473 --> 03:53:37.834]  That's right.
[03:53:37.834 --> 03:53:43.355]  They basically threaten members of Congress with mass bank closures, the little guys, and then that would create riots.
[03:53:43.355 --> 03:53:44.496]  We're going back to the full audience.
[03:53:44.496 --> 03:53:44.816]  Go ahead.
[03:53:44.816 --> 03:53:45.016]  Here we go.
[03:53:47.799 --> 03:53:49.020]  Strange days are here.
[03:53:49.020 --> 03:53:51.042]  Finish up with what you were talking about, the banks.
[03:53:51.042 --> 03:54:01.353]  Yeah, I was just mentioning how, you know, they threaten members of Congress by saying all these small banks are going to go under, we're going to have riots in the streets, we're going to have to put the military on the streets and declare martial law, no big deal.
[03:54:01.353 --> 03:54:04.176]  So please pass this bailout so we don't have to strong-arm you.
[03:54:04.676 --> 03:54:06.698]  You know, but that is a strong-arm tactic.
[03:54:06.698 --> 03:54:08.979]  It's unbelievable we stood up for it, Alex.
[03:54:08.979 --> 03:54:13.603]  It's unbelievable that not one person in the mainstream media even reported on that.
[03:54:13.603 --> 03:54:23.390]  Thank God for C-SPAN, because without it, we wouldn't even know these members of Congress had been threatened in private meetings.
[03:54:23.390 --> 03:54:26.072]  Well, maybe they're with Al-Qaeda.
[03:54:26.072 --> 03:54:29.375]  You don't let the bankers have everything, you're with Al-Qaeda, boy.
[03:54:30.424 --> 03:54:32.645]  You don't get rid of America, you're not patriotic!
[03:54:32.645 --> 03:54:40.109]  You know, and speaking of bankers... Yeah, let's get into the... Yeah, this is a good transition, because the Rothschild family is one of these massive banking families.
[03:54:40.109 --> 03:54:43.090]  And here it is, The Telegraph, one of the biggest papers in London.
[03:54:43.090 --> 03:54:44.111]  Let me see it, I'll show folks.
[03:54:44.111 --> 03:54:44.251]  Yep.
[03:54:44.251 --> 03:54:51.554]  The Telegraph, this isn't... I'm not reading this off Prison Planet or InfoWars.com, this is mainline media.
[03:54:51.554 --> 03:54:54.896]  And let me just read the first couple paragraphs and we'll get into it and why it's important.
[03:54:55.652 --> 03:54:56.573]  Okay.
[03:54:56.573 --> 03:55:09.169]  Rather than the eclectic group of rich at play, the shadow chancellor, this is the shadow chancellor in Europe, was unwittingly made privy to closely guarded relationship between Mendelssohn and the Rothschild family that spanned nearly two decades.
[03:55:09.169 --> 03:55:12.954]  By the way, news, the media a decade ago would say the Rothschilds didn't exist.
[03:55:13.454 --> 03:55:18.076]  Yeah, and now they're saying, oh, well, they have a two-decade relationship with the Parliament.
[03:55:18.076 --> 03:55:19.717]  You know, absolutely.
[03:55:19.717 --> 03:55:31.343]  During this time, their business and personal lives had become entwined many times, including on this occasion with their mutual friend, the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, and had forged a far stronger bond.
[03:55:31.783 --> 03:55:35.345]  Yes, but it turns out every time they bust an oligarch, it's really a Rothschild front in Russia.
[03:55:35.345 --> 03:55:38.846]  Yeah, yeah, with university chum and host Nathaniel Rothschild.
[03:55:38.846 --> 03:55:44.469]  Now, why am I getting into this other than the fact that they're showing that the Rothschilds and the government have a huge relationship?
[03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:48.911]  Well, it was Nathaniel Rothschild that rolled on this shadow chancellor.
[03:55:48.911 --> 03:55:49.631]  Why?
[03:55:49.631 --> 03:55:53.653]  Now, what he's saying is, and John Harmon's got the clip, I don't know if we're actually going to be able to get to it.
[03:55:53.653 --> 03:55:54.493]  How long is that clip, Harmon?
[03:55:54.493 --> 03:55:55.094]  About five minutes.
[03:55:56.014 --> 03:56:09.044]  But it basically states that Rothschild wrote in to one of the main papers, a letter to the editor, said that this billionaire in Russia was giving Mendelsohn and the Shadow Chancellor illegal funds, and he's trying to burn them.
[03:56:09.044 --> 03:56:10.385]  Why is he trying to burn them?
[03:56:10.385 --> 03:56:12.726]  Well, we know because the oligarchs were fronts for the Rothschilds.
[03:56:12.726 --> 03:56:17.310]  It's come out in the financial times of London, and so they're now, might be losing some control, probably trying to burn him.
[03:56:17.310 --> 03:56:17.750]  Exactly.
[03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:20.372]  It makes me think that the Shadow Chancellor... Well, we know that's happened before.
[03:56:20.372 --> 03:56:22.574]  Yeah, is probably going against one of their policies.
[03:56:22.574 --> 03:56:24.275]  And now... No, these guys fight with each other.
[03:56:24.315 --> 03:56:24.996]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:56:24.996 --> 03:56:27.517]  Hey, is that clip up on InfoWars?
[03:56:27.517 --> 03:56:30.179]  We'll post that Rothschild clip.
[03:56:30.179 --> 03:56:33.441]  I got Aaron out there editing all this Willie video that's going up.
[03:56:33.441 --> 03:56:38.025]  Oh, look for that this evening to go viral at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:56:38.025 --> 03:56:38.905]  You know what?
[03:56:38.905 --> 03:56:41.327]  When you fill in on the show tomorrow or Wednesday, play the clip.
[03:56:41.327 --> 03:56:43.929]  Yeah, we will definitely play that clip.
[03:56:43.929 --> 03:56:45.510]  Yes, John Harmon will have it.
[03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:47.071]  The great guy over at GCN.
[03:56:49.580 --> 03:56:50.121]  I love John.
[03:56:50.121 --> 03:56:51.604]  He does a great job for this network.
[03:56:51.604 --> 03:56:52.446]  Everybody here does a bad job.
[03:56:52.446 --> 03:56:53.488]  And Paul's got a nickname.
[03:56:53.488 --> 03:56:54.310]  What is it?
[03:56:54.310 --> 03:56:55.833]  Hoosh?
[03:56:55.833 --> 03:56:56.294]  Hoosh?
[03:56:56.294 --> 03:56:57.837]  Burmy?
[03:56:57.837 --> 03:56:58.177]  Harmy?
[03:56:59.312 --> 03:57:00.533]  What about Jacobson?
[03:57:00.533 --> 03:57:02.214]  What about Robbie?
[03:57:02.214 --> 03:57:04.735]  Robbie?
[03:57:04.735 --> 03:57:07.857]  We've got to give Ventura... Ventura?
[03:57:07.857 --> 03:57:09.358]  I don't want to give him a nickname.
[03:57:09.358 --> 03:57:13.521]  He'll probably end up in my bedroom at 3 in the morning staring at me like a CL1.
[03:57:13.521 --> 03:57:20.946]  Some of the stuff he's like, if you tell anybody what I've told you, just remember I will be in your bedroom years from now and you don't expect it.
[03:57:20.946 --> 03:57:22.527]  We don't get angry, we get even.
[03:57:23.047 --> 03:57:24.248]  And we take our time.
[03:57:24.248 --> 03:57:26.109]  It doesn't have to be today, Alex.
[03:57:26.109 --> 03:57:27.530]  It doesn't have to be tomorrow.
[03:57:27.530 --> 03:57:30.572]  It could be a week, a month, or a year from now.
[03:57:30.572 --> 03:57:33.313]  You know how I deal with poachers?
[03:57:33.313 --> 03:57:36.475]  You know how I deal with poachers on my little lake?
[03:57:36.475 --> 03:57:42.279]  I strap my 9mm to my side and I go right up to them, Alex, and I let them know, this is a private lake.
[03:57:42.279 --> 03:57:44.901]  Who gave you permission to go here?
[03:57:44.901 --> 03:57:46.742]  And you know what happens if they give me crap?
[03:57:48.638 --> 03:57:51.741]  I take their bike, Alex, and I bring it to the police.
[03:57:51.741 --> 03:57:53.303]  I take their crap.
[03:57:53.303 --> 03:57:54.905]  I take them to the police myself.
