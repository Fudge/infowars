[00:00.000 --> 00:14.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.440 --> 00:32.740]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well I didn't get home till
[00:32.740 --> 00:39.280]  about 12 30 last night and then I got him 5 a.m. to take Jesse Ventura to the airport at 6 a.m.
[00:39.280 --> 00:45.720]  for a 7 a.m. flight I just talked to Ted Anderson loans Genesis who was on the same flight back
[00:45.720 --> 00:51.240]  they just got back to Minneapolis they were on the same flight on Northwest why is that important
[00:51.240 --> 00:58.920]  because Ventura said listen you got to have this guy on it's a close race for the Senate and you
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.960]  know he's the only anti-establishment candidate it's the guy that Ventura appointed the Senate
[01:04.960 --> 01:16.520]  for like a month whenever Senator Wellstone died mysteriously in that plane crash and he of course
[01:16.520 --> 01:25.440]  was part of the Liberty Rally with Ron Paul so he's a he's a Ron Paul supporter and very closely
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.240]  aligned with Ron Paul I don't know what time they're coming on today because Ventura's got
[01:30.240 --> 01:36.680]  to get home first but I think it's around noon or 12 30 and it's been tourists I did to do this so
[01:36.680 --> 01:42.400]  I'm it it will probably happen but we won't just be talking about that we spent four hours out at
[01:42.400 --> 01:49.880]  Willie Nelson's house and that was an amazing story in and of itself we've got close to four
[01:49.880 --> 01:55.120]  hours of interviews with Willie Nelson and I've seen a lot of media and other people out at his
[01:55.120 --> 02:01.600]  place before and never seen him give people tours of his home we hung out in his bedroom slash
[02:01.600 --> 02:11.120]  Dan for about an hour and talked about everything we've got Jesse and Willie on video talking about
[02:11.120 --> 02:16.600]  the New World Order talking about everything under the Sun for almost four hours we're out there
[02:16.600 --> 02:21.520]  four hours but I think total it's about three and a half hours of footage and I got two guys out
[02:21.520 --> 02:26.560]  here just trying to log the tapes just trying to walk to the tapes they got in at 9 a.m. this morning
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.840]  they're out there doing a great job Jason Bermas is down here for the week to visit with us and
[02:32.840 --> 02:39.360]  work on some things and also the real reason is to get his braces every few months he's got to come
[02:39.360 --> 02:48.520]  out of his my dad to get his braces worked on but just absolutely amazing so I because it was an
[02:48.520 --> 02:54.120]  intense four hours out at Willie's place on the bus at his little town of luck as little town
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.840]  reshoots movies with all these old real western houses they brought in then at his house then
[02:58.840 --> 03:04.560]  seeing his wild horses he's got 70 something of them and then they were running late at the event
[03:04.560 --> 03:10.520]  with all the other bands Willie didn't even get there till after Jimmy Vaughn basically had gone
[03:10.520 --> 03:16.840]  off and we did some live stuff some live feeds some of them went out some didn't but we didn't
[03:16.840 --> 03:21.360]  again I explain this to people we were tagged on because Willie had the idea from a caller on
[03:21.360 --> 03:29.000]  the show to have a whole 9-11 slash event anti-war and then he said no just come to my event and
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  speak and then it just all was crazy and wild and and that thing was overflowing with people and
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.320]  Ventura was just having such a great time he just said ah whatever let's just go do some live feeds
[03:39.320 --> 03:45.200]  over here because they were gonna wait and I guess then Willie wouldn't have to laugh after after
[03:45.200 --> 03:50.080]  you know 12 30 or so just for us to do that Ventura me tell you something hanging out with Ventura
[03:50.080 --> 03:55.280]  for two days I've been around a lot of quotes celebrities and people they're all you know
[03:55.280 --> 04:02.560]  interesting folks but but Ventura is a wild man I mean this guy you think I have energy this guy
[04:02.560 --> 04:12.960]  this guy is just amazing and so interesting and and we shot like two hours driving around the car
[04:12.960 --> 04:19.480]  with him so we've got almost four hours of Willie and Ventura we probably got two hours wouldn't
[04:19.480 --> 04:25.880]  you say guys two hours in the car with Ventura turtle no and driving around I mean it is just
[04:25.880 --> 04:32.440]  really interesting footage really powerful and that is the big event because we're gonna put

[11:45.120 --> 11:50.720]  property he lives very modestly up on a mountain yeah and you know it just you know I'm not saying
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.280]  New York guy I'm a country guy and just to see the guy you know he doesn't live in a big lavish
[11:55.280 --> 12:00.320]  mansion or whatever and the room he really likes to hang out with and is what like maybe 20 by 40
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.320]  you know that last room he showed us so it was really cool to be somebody that other bedroom
[12:04.320 --> 12:07.600]  there at the little table with the checkers you know not that one talking about the little
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.600]  den that he took us to later all the side house yeah the little side house like I like to hang
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.520]  out here and then the bus is so narrow and he likes to hang out there it's just was so cool
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.200]  and you can see his generosity there were a lot of horses out there that he'd rescue you could
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.760]  tell they weren't like that 70 something rescued mustangs yeah yeah and you could tell that they
[12:23.760 --> 12:26.880]  were rescued horses that they would have been slaughtered otherwise so you know he had a great
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.320]  heart and just to hang out with Jesse Ventura too man I mean you were there it was great I mean
[12:30.320 --> 12:34.400]  two of them together and it was crazy oh it was it was a ham and you know prismplanet.com and
[12:34.400 --> 12:38.640]  prismplanet.tv is going to be putting that stuff up it's it's awesome I mean I'd want to be a member
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.880]  I wasn't ever I mean this is stuff that I if I wasn't there I'd want to see oh regardless
[12:42.880 --> 12:47.200]  everybody's gonna get to see it yeah the the the the members just get in the high quality
[12:47.200 --> 12:51.360]  and I always feel like I'm kind of hurting them not just having this closely for them but I'm
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.040]  happy that folks grab and put all the web because that's our main mission as long as we can pay
[12:55.040 --> 13:02.800]  the bills we're happy but anyways and we also sent out Timmy Vaughn's transmission and some live
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.320]  reports from Jesse Ventura and some others now I'm not sure how many people even saw those
[13:08.320 --> 13:12.480]  some people commenting saying we didn't see you in Ventura or we didn't see you guys speaking
[13:12.480 --> 13:18.160]  and we did a bunch of live reports there so I'm but but that's all saved on a DVD so the thing
[13:18.160 --> 13:25.760]  about live on the web well we recorded it there so regardless that we need to call David because
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.960]  he was out there video on that with the web stuff we need to get that DVD because that had a line
[13:30.960 --> 13:34.400]  audio well yeah I mean that way we can just take that and put that on the web and it's so much
[13:34.400 --> 13:38.480]  quicker than having to dump our tapes and go through all that but um very exciting you know
[13:38.480 --> 13:42.880]  you're in a crowd of 5,000 people Jesse Ventura is there you're there the lights are on we're
[13:42.880 --> 13:46.720]  talking about peace I mean it was it was awesome Alex it was just so cool to be back there I
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.520]  talked to Jimmy Vaughn he was very nice to me I mean just a dream come true day I mean a life
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.400]  experience like no other I couldn't trade this in for any vacation in the world Alex absolutely
[13:57.120 --> 14:04.800]  um just uh again I'm I'm operating on about three hours sleep here because what we left about
[14:05.520 --> 14:09.920]  midnight and then I went and dropped and turned off the hotel at the Griskell and then we came
[14:09.920 --> 14:14.400]  over here to the office and talked about 30 minutes and I went home I got home about 115
[14:14.400 --> 14:22.240]  and then man 445 no no 455 I slept in the guest bedroom so I wouldn't wake my wife up
[14:22.240 --> 14:26.080]  and uh and I don't even know why I'm talking about that right now I'm in zombie mode but you know
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.920]  what a huge weight is off me because this whole thing was you know first it was you know Willy
[14:31.920 --> 14:36.080]  on air he's like yeah I set the venue have a huge event he goes well I'm real busy just come to this
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.480]  event I'm like you want me to go to the last backyard and have us you know be inserted into
[14:40.480 --> 14:44.240]  this and do this with people that are already there the thing was basically already sold out
[14:44.240 --> 14:50.560]  but then it went pretty well so it's done and I'm happy but but the the event is going to be these
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.000]  interviews because folks you know I don't hype up interviews unless they're really big amazing stuff
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.080]  I mean amazing amazing video and then there were some times we switched the cameras off that was
[15:02.080 --> 15:09.440]  even more amazing uh but uh but it was it was definitely I mean something else absolutely
[15:09.440 --> 15:14.560]  and you know just to get an insight someone who's lived life like Jesse Ventura I mean we talked about
[15:14.560 --> 15:19.280]  not only his wrestling career acting career and governor career but his music career as well and
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.440]  his dealing with virgin records I mean it was just so cool it was a bodyguard of the rolling
[15:23.440 --> 15:29.440]  stones yeah yeah yeah I mean it was just craziness I mean he was telling all these uh all these
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.520]  military stories and then telling stories about catching poachers on his little lake yeah can
[15:33.520 --> 15:39.600]  you imagine Jesse Ventura pulling up with a machine gun yeah I mean just like you're out there
[15:39.600 --> 15:42.800]  you're fishing on you know illegal property and you think you're gonna get away with it and all
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.360]  of a sudden this six foot five monster comes up to you and you're like oh my god this is Jesse
[15:47.360 --> 15:51.360]  right there and he's like what are you doing here and it's just you know it was some people were
[15:51.360 --> 15:56.080]  saying you know Jesse when I first met him about two years ago was so skinny and perfect shape for
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.560]  his age you know look told and then now he's gained some weight and stuff well Jesse nine months ago
[16:00.560 --> 16:05.120]  had a hip replacement yeah and so he's been back in the U.S. and he hadn't been able to jog or anything
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.520]  but now he did hip placement did well you know you're not supposed to run for a long time to
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.120]  make it really set right now it's good now he's just about to get back into running and everything
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.160]  so that's really great I mean I he's just an amazing guy and uh well wait till you see the
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.680]  video folks I mean you know us in there arguing about the new world order all having heated
[16:23.680 --> 16:28.240]  discussions I mean Willie Nelson Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura it's quite a mix I mean it is
[16:28.240 --> 16:32.320]  quite a mix and you know just to get you know Willie Nelson on the record about these global
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.640]  issues is great you know he seemed really informed he had the little XM radio going on he's like I
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.480]  listened to Air American we're like yeah America's good but you know some of the guys you listen to
[16:40.480 --> 16:44.640]  you've had on the show Alex people like Mike Malloy who have brought 9-11 truth out so Willie's
[16:44.640 --> 16:49.440]  very aware of that and that was very nice to see and you know Jesse was rocking a shirt yesterday
[16:49.440 --> 16:54.240]  that said Obama McCain and anyone else and he had anyone else checked off and a lot of people
[16:54.240 --> 16:58.480]  were making comments uh well I was you know taping you guys and they saw that shirt they're like
[16:58.480 --> 17:03.280]  anyone else on the Kane supporter I'm an Obama supporter and it's nice to see that now he is
[17:03.280 --> 17:08.000]  around that because when you first interviewed him he's like watch out Barack Obama for an
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.400]  assassination but it seems he's kind of gotten beyond that and sees you know well since then
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.880]  Obama has said he's for the wiretapping without warrants and since then oh maybe we need to go
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.440]  ahead and stay in Iraq yeah exactly so that's why Ventura when he was saying you know in the war
[17:21.440 --> 17:25.920]  and do all this oh well maybe he's good but as soon as he backed off on that yeah but I mean he's
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.240]  hoodwinked a lot of people Obama and it's nice to see that he has not hoodwinked Jesse Ventura
[17:30.240 --> 17:35.840]  he's left the run for a presidential run open in the next four years I hope that he runs folks
[17:35.840 --> 17:39.680]  I mean this guy I really believe this is the guy that can help save the republic he's the
[17:39.680 --> 17:43.200]  everyman he may not be well I mean I mean knowing this actually you know because I've been around
[17:43.200 --> 17:47.280]  a few other times and interviewed him a lot but being in person with him for two days driving around
[17:47.280 --> 17:51.840]  eat with him hanging out you guys hanging out with us at the Driscoll anywhere else I mean he is
[17:51.840 --> 17:57.040]  the real deal yeah I mean he's just a real person and uh and you can tell when he gets hyped up
[17:57.040 --> 18:00.320]  because he starts moving around I mean you know we were having that discussion before and like
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.640]  first half of the day he wasn't moving around a lot but when he gets really emotional you can tell
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.480]  he's very very let's just boil it down I gotta hardly get an interview in the car because
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.560]  you guys were arguing so much you know I can forward so you got Jesse hanging over the seat
[18:12.560 --> 18:17.360]  in the front with me driving through traffic screaming at you guys we were talking North American
[18:17.360 --> 18:22.000]  Union it got a little heated you know you know Jesse's an ardent supporter of no borders and
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.040]  you know we talk well I mean I mean he wants sovereignty but you know in his words
[18:27.040 --> 18:33.200]  hey what's wrong with these brown people and our whole point is the globalist openly in their own
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.440]  documents and we were sourcing them say that they want to drive down the way just break down the
[18:37.440 --> 18:44.000]  cohesion not just of the US but other nations and that the national sovereignty is their enemy
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.840]  and I mean and then also I'm like Jesse I understand you're a nice guy and you're
[18:47.840 --> 18:51.360]  friendly and you don't care about what's happening in Mexico the point is their government's taught
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.880]  them this belongs to Mexico gringos are bad and uh you know we've educated him a lot we're going
[18:56.880 --> 19:00.320]  to bring him the rest of the way along on that I guarantee I mean look how much we've already
[19:00.320 --> 19:04.320]  de-programmed Jesse Ventura oh absolutely and you know once he realizes it's more about a
[19:04.320 --> 19:08.720]  consolidation of power it's about a North American Union a European Union a Pan American Union
[19:08.720 --> 19:12.560]  Eurasian Union so they can consolidate into this one world government I think he's going to see
[19:12.560 --> 19:17.840]  the bigger picture and you did mention to him and they'll see this on the web soon tragedy and hope
[19:17.840 --> 19:22.240]  Carol Quigley the round table group road scholars I think we got to get him a little acquainted
[19:22.240 --> 19:26.320]  with G Edward Griffin's work you know that would be good for him I think give him the creature from
[19:26.320 --> 19:30.560]  Jekyll Island and let him watch the New World Order speech that uh he gives that lecture I think
[19:30.560 --> 19:34.160]  that would be really good for Jesse to understand that even though that sounds good on the future
[19:34.160 --> 19:38.320]  I mean I'm all for personal freedom across the world if tomorrow I could change the world and
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.400]  everybody was free and be all for it but that's not the reality of the situation they're going
[19:42.400 --> 19:48.960]  to try to bring this global government in through us consenting to it exactly hey Jason Burmese

[24:15.680 --> 24:21.360]  This is the end, my only friend
[24:21.360 --> 24:33.440]  This is the end, oh my love, this is the end of everything that stands

[24:49.440 --> 24:54.160]  All right, here is the news I need to get to, man this is all super heavy
[24:56.080 --> 24:59.200]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend
[25:01.120 --> 25:04.800]  What have we been telling you for weeks? They're hoarding the cash
[25:04.800 --> 25:09.840]  They're giving none of it to the public or to main street corporations
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.840]  The big central banks orchestrated the financial collapse
[25:15.840 --> 25:20.720]  So that they could drive down the economy even more than claim it was a bailout
[25:20.720 --> 25:23.920]  Give themselves trillions of dollars to buy up the assets
[25:25.920 --> 25:28.320]  While they hyper-inflate the currency
[25:29.840 --> 25:32.640]  So they're depressing the price of everything to consolidate it
[25:33.520 --> 25:36.480]  Once they own even more, it's going to go hyper-inflationary
[25:36.480 --> 25:38.400]  It already is on main street
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.800]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.640]  Dodd highlights rising public anger at credit crunch and says
[25:47.360 --> 25:50.240]  It looks like the banks are hoarding the cash, of course they are
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.920]  And then oh look, the market's going down more, give us even more
[25:53.920 --> 25:56.080]  Oh look, it's going down even more, give us even more
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.600]  By the way, they're not cutting your interest rates on cars and houses and everything
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.920]  People are getting higher and higher interest rates if they try to buy a house or a car
[26:07.920 --> 26:11.600]  But they're talking about cutting it down to 1%
[26:12.240 --> 26:13.520]  That's only for the banks
[26:15.200 --> 26:17.280]  Perino, the White House press secretary says
[26:17.280 --> 26:20.160]  We'll just have to trust our secretary on banker takeover
[26:20.160 --> 26:22.720]  And curtain them on a great story at infowars.com
[26:23.840 --> 26:27.040]  With all the quotes where they're admitting, the mainstream news is admitting
[26:27.040 --> 26:29.600]  That the banker takeover is pretty much secret
[26:29.600 --> 26:31.760]  They're just giving each other hundreds of millions of dollars
[26:31.760 --> 26:34.720]  And it's all secret and they just say we'll just need to trust them
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.000]  E.U. calls for new world governance
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.280]  This is a 10 minute clip
[26:42.240 --> 26:46.720]  And I would play it, but a lot of it's in French and Spanish
[26:47.280 --> 26:49.760]  And it shows them, but then it cuts back to people in English
[26:50.560 --> 26:51.760]  Including the head of the E.U.
[26:53.840 --> 26:57.040]  Where they're calling it new world order, new world governance
[26:57.040 --> 26:58.240]  I mean, you get to hear it all
[26:58.960 --> 27:00.240]  Wiseup Journal did a report on that
[27:00.240 --> 27:02.880]  We have a link to it up on infowars.com
[27:02.880 --> 27:04.800]  E.U. calls for new world governance
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.000]  I mean, every day I see scores of videos and news articles
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.760]  Where they're just openly saying a world government running for and by the banks
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.440]  Britain may need 0% interest rate to avoid a depression leading economists warns
[27:22.480 --> 27:24.000]  But again, that's for the banks, not the people
[27:24.640 --> 27:28.400]  Bernanke battles big time economic erosion with new rate cuts
[27:28.400 --> 27:29.200]  We'll be getting into that
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.760]  And then getting out of financial news
[27:31.760 --> 27:34.720]  Syria condemns U.S. raid as terrible crime
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.560]  A helicopter attack
[27:37.680 --> 27:39.360]  Blowing up some houses in a village
[27:41.360 --> 27:45.200]  Killing at least eight civilians on a Syrian farm
[27:46.960 --> 27:49.440]  I mean, this is the type of just rogue behavior
[27:50.640 --> 27:53.920]  Going on that makes us look like absolute demons worldwide
[27:56.720 --> 27:58.320]  And then there's all this police state news
[27:58.320 --> 28:01.680]  Police will be able to check the identities of people in the street
[28:01.680 --> 28:03.280]  Using mobile fingerprint scanners
[28:04.560 --> 28:05.440]  All over
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.080]  The U.S., the western world period
[28:10.080 --> 28:12.320]  They're putting in thumb scanners in the cars
[28:12.320 --> 28:13.760]  See, they got your thumb prints
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.560]  When you go get your driver's license
[28:16.560 --> 28:19.760]  As I told you under the executive order back in the mid 90s, they were planning
[28:20.880 --> 28:21.680]  Here it is
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.080]  ACL uses two-thirds of the U.S. population lives in Constitution-free zone
[28:26.080 --> 28:31.920]  Before 9-11, we had these agenda 21, 125 miles home
[28:32.560 --> 28:36.480]  And because two-thirds of the U.S. population lives on the coastlines
[28:36.480 --> 28:38.640]  And on the borders, that's two-thirds of the population
[28:38.640 --> 28:40.960]  Now, they don't search you when you come across the border generally
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.560]  Reports are coming in that it's at these zones, 50 miles, 100 miles
[28:47.520 --> 28:50.400]  You know, past major cities and they stop and search you
[28:50.400 --> 28:54.080]  And again, it's all in the name of stopping the illegal alien invasion
[28:54.080 --> 28:56.640]  When they selectively enforce and don't stop that
[28:56.640 --> 29:00.880]  And so, again, they sell up the name of
[29:00.880 --> 29:03.520]  Indian illegal immigration has nothing to do with that
[29:03.520 --> 29:05.120]  And you know, we've protested and covered it
[29:05.120 --> 29:07.760]  And gone out there with our cameras at the FEMA camp
[29:08.480 --> 29:11.040]  In Taylor, Texas, north of Austin
[29:11.040 --> 29:14.320]  Where they take whole immigrant families without due process
[29:14.320 --> 29:15.680]  Anything, their children, all of them
[29:16.480 --> 29:18.560]  There's playgrounds behind the barbed wire
[29:19.200 --> 29:21.040]  With these kids running around in their uniforms
[29:21.040 --> 29:22.240]  There's footage of that in Endgame
[29:22.240 --> 29:24.480]  And, no, I'm against that
[29:25.680 --> 29:26.480]  Due process
[29:28.320 --> 29:31.360]  But again, they know how to play psychological games
[29:34.160 --> 29:36.320]  That is just some of the news I've got
[29:36.320 --> 29:38.880]  We're going to detail more of it on the other side

[32:20.560 --> 32:24.080]  In an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the US
[32:24.080 --> 32:26.800]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe
[32:26.800 --> 32:29.440]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the US this fall?

[33:29.120 --> 33:35.440]  We are back live, thank you for joining us
[33:38.320 --> 33:41.440]  Jesse Ventura had the idea yesterday to come on the radio there tomorrow
[33:43.600 --> 33:46.320]  Talk about Dean Barkley who he appointed to be senator
[33:46.320 --> 33:47.760]  Because the states previously
[33:48.560 --> 33:50.320]  To the legislatures appointed
[33:52.080 --> 33:55.360]  Senators that's because the people were voting in the state
[33:55.360 --> 33:57.760]  And we control the federal government through the states
[33:57.760 --> 33:59.760]  And so the senators
[34:02.240 --> 34:04.320]  Were again elected by the people because they were appointed
[34:04.320 --> 34:06.240]  Through the legislature elected by the people
[34:06.240 --> 34:08.560]  But with the 17th amendment that was removed
[34:08.560 --> 34:13.040]  But a vestige of that back in 1913 remained
[34:13.040 --> 34:14.560]  That if a senator died
[34:15.600 --> 34:18.480]  You always wonder how when a senator dies or congressman dies
[34:18.480 --> 34:20.160]  How suddenly generally their wife
[34:20.720 --> 34:23.920]  Or sometimes their chief aide is the senator or congressman
[34:23.920 --> 34:26.640]  The house member for the next year six months
[34:26.640 --> 34:28.000]  Sometimes two three years
[34:30.320 --> 34:32.960]  That's because governors can appoint
[34:33.760 --> 34:35.840]  The senator for the rest of that term
[34:35.840 --> 34:38.720]  And he appointed Dean Barkley so you can give him the title senator
[34:39.360 --> 34:42.000]  And he actually Barkley called me last week
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.640]  Wanted to get on the show and I just got busy and didn't get back with him
[34:46.720 --> 34:49.600]  He was part of the campaign for liberty there at the Ron Paul event as well
[34:49.600 --> 34:50.880]  Great guy, great platform
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.440]  And Ventura's really good friends with him
[34:53.440 --> 34:55.040]  He was trying to tell me listen you got to get him on
[34:55.040 --> 34:56.640]  You got to promote the campaign it's close
[34:57.680 --> 34:59.840]  He's got a chance to beat Franken and the other guy
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.800]  And the senator's a big deal
[35:02.800 --> 35:04.240]  So that's an important voice to have
[35:06.160 --> 35:09.120]  But by a stroke of fate Ted Anderson this morning
[35:09.120 --> 35:12.240]  It's flew out on the same flight I guess it's 730
[35:12.240 --> 35:13.680]  Their flight left about 30 minutes late
[35:13.680 --> 35:14.880]  It was be of 7am flight
[35:15.520 --> 35:16.960]  I dropped him off there at 6am
[35:17.680 --> 35:20.160]  But Ted was on the same plane with Ventura
[35:20.160 --> 35:22.400]  So I would have thought Ventura would already been back
[35:22.400 --> 35:24.160]  With about 30 minutes to go right before I went on air
[35:24.160 --> 35:26.640]  Ted called like hey we just got off the plane with Ventura
[35:26.640 --> 35:28.720]  So he's got to get home and I got to line that up
[35:28.720 --> 35:30.720]  So sometime next hour or the hour after that
[35:32.080 --> 35:33.680]  Ventura is going to be on
[35:33.680 --> 35:36.000]  Talk a little bit about what happened here in Austin as well
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.040]  Great time with Willie
[35:37.040 --> 35:38.400]  Had his place for four hours
[35:38.400 --> 35:40.640]  And then some of the live reports we did out there
[35:41.760 --> 35:45.680]  But man we'll be talking about Dean Barkley
[35:45.680 --> 35:47.520]  And then poor Selicastillo
[35:47.520 --> 35:51.280]  Great patriot set up convicted three years in prison
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.760]  And so we'll be talking to him coming up in the fourth hour today
[36:01.280 --> 36:03.200]  All right let me get into the news here
[36:05.920 --> 36:09.760]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend
[36:09.760 --> 36:11.360]  Prisonplanet.com
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.480]  This is an important article on many facets
[36:15.680 --> 36:18.160]  Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend
[36:18.160 --> 36:21.760]  The revolution issues a big deal
[36:22.960 --> 36:26.000]  And then the fact that he's talking about banks are not lending
[36:27.360 --> 36:27.840]  You see
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.360]  They're hoarding the cash
[36:32.720 --> 36:35.040]  Now you're going to pay for that cash with tax money
[36:35.040 --> 36:36.000]  You're going to pay that back
[36:37.120 --> 36:38.560]  Because that's how the bankers set it up
[36:39.520 --> 36:41.280]  When money's created they get the interest
[36:42.320 --> 36:44.240]  And then you get to pay for inflation
[36:44.240 --> 36:46.640]  I mean who comes up with stuff like this
[36:46.640 --> 36:49.360]  I mean and you try to convince the public
[36:49.360 --> 36:51.520]  That when it's all stated you know openly
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.360]  And they say oh there's nothing sophisticated
[36:53.360 --> 36:55.440]  There's nobody that knows how to do anything like that
[36:55.440 --> 36:56.880]  In the elite
[36:56.880 --> 36:58.400]  They just run things because they're idiots
[36:58.400 --> 36:59.760]  That's why they're in power
[36:59.760 --> 37:00.640]  Yeah that's right
[37:01.520 --> 37:02.880]  In this hyper competitive world
[37:02.880 --> 37:04.640]  The elites tells you what they're doing to you
[37:04.640 --> 37:07.280]  And giant white papers and government reports
[37:07.280 --> 37:09.680]  But the public just oh no they
[37:09.680 --> 37:12.320]  They don't know how to wipe their noses or tie their shoelaces
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.600]  I'm more and more just look at the abject denial
[37:17.600 --> 37:19.200]  But that denial is starting to go away
[37:19.200 --> 37:20.160]  People are getting it
[37:20.160 --> 37:22.560]  Senator predicts revolution and banks don't lend
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.480]  Dodd highlights a rising public anger at credit crunch bailout
[37:27.120 --> 37:30.080]  Senator Christopher Dodd has shockingly predicted
[37:30.080 --> 37:34.000]  That public anger at banks refusal to disperse credit
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.520]  Could lead to revolution
[37:35.520 --> 37:37.600]  While another analyst says government intervention
[37:37.600 --> 37:41.120]  Could mean banks are cut out of the loop entirely
[37:41.120 --> 37:43.040]  It turns out that they're hoarding
[37:45.600 --> 37:47.680]  It turns out that they're hoarding
[37:49.440 --> 37:51.040]  You'll have a revolution on your hands
[37:51.040 --> 37:53.600]  People will be so livid and furious
[37:53.600 --> 37:56.080]  That their tax money is going to line the pockets
[37:56.080 --> 37:57.520]  Instead of doing the right thing
[37:57.520 --> 37:58.640]  There will be hell to pay
[37:59.680 --> 38:01.840]  Well that's why they've got the face scanning cameras
[38:01.840 --> 38:05.200]  And the gate cameras of how you walk
[38:05.200 --> 38:07.120]  And the heat resonance cameras
[38:07.120 --> 38:09.280]  And the plate scanners
[38:09.280 --> 38:11.360]  And the SWAT teams in the FEMA camps
[38:12.400 --> 38:14.480]  The British Ministry of Defense report says
[38:14.480 --> 38:16.000]  They're going to take everything we've got
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.840]  In the US and England and Europe
[38:17.840 --> 38:18.960]  And the people are going to rebel
[38:18.960 --> 38:21.200]  And that the troops are going to have to slaughter us in the streets
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.680]  And because they work for the bankers
[38:23.680 --> 38:24.720]  Whether they know it or not
[38:27.600 --> 38:28.400]  It turns out
[38:30.640 --> 38:31.760]  If it turns out they're hoarding
[38:31.760 --> 38:33.280]  You'll have a revolution on your hands
[38:33.280 --> 38:35.040]  People will be so livid and furious
[38:35.040 --> 38:36.880]  That their tax money is going to line the pockets
[38:36.880 --> 38:38.880]  Instead of doing the right thing
[38:38.880 --> 38:40.000]  There will be hell to pay
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.760]  Dodd told the New York Times this weekend
[38:42.560 --> 38:44.960]  And will the public ever figure out the hyperinflation
[38:44.960 --> 38:47.280]  Devaluing their paycheck and their currency
[38:48.240 --> 38:49.920]  And they've got to pay it back in tax money
[38:51.280 --> 38:53.040]  Do you think they're going to get mad then?
[38:54.080 --> 38:55.760]  No, they're just going to find out
[38:55.760 --> 38:57.200]  That they weren't given the money
[38:57.200 --> 38:58.480]  That was theirs to begin with
[38:59.520 --> 39:01.360]  You know, it's bad enough that it
[39:01.360 --> 39:03.280]  It'd be like the bankers loaning us our own money
[39:03.280 --> 39:04.640]  That's how the scam works
[39:04.640 --> 39:05.920]  And then we have to pay interest on it
[39:05.920 --> 39:07.520]  And it'd be bad enough if they just gave it to us
[39:07.520 --> 39:08.800]  Because then nothing's free
[39:09.440 --> 39:10.960]  We're going to have to pay for it
[39:10.960 --> 39:13.280]  But instead, you get nothing but slavery
[39:14.880 --> 39:17.680]  Let me read Senator Dodd again from The New York Times today
[39:18.240 --> 39:19.920]  If it turns out that they are hoarding
[39:20.480 --> 39:21.920]  You'll have a revolution on your hands
[39:21.920 --> 39:24.160]  People will be so livid and furious
[39:24.160 --> 39:26.400]  That their tax money is going to line the pockets
[39:26.400 --> 39:27.840]  Instead of doing the right thing
[39:27.840 --> 39:28.800]  There will be hell to pay
[39:28.800 --> 39:30.160]  Dodd told the New York Times this weekend
[39:30.160 --> 39:32.160]  Meanwhile, Chief Investment Strategist
[39:32.160 --> 39:33.120]  Sean Corrigan
[39:34.400 --> 39:34.720]  From
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.560]  Dipas in Commodities
[39:39.600 --> 39:41.200]  Management told CNBC this morning
[39:41.200 --> 39:44.000]  That the banks may have to be cut out of the loop
[39:44.000 --> 39:45.680]  If the freeze and credit markets continues
[39:45.680 --> 39:48.320]  Forcing governments to act as the lender of last resort
[39:49.120 --> 39:52.000]  Corrigan said that banking was a business
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.040]  Which is desperately in need of a coal in the world
[39:55.040 --> 39:58.240]  But nobody wants a bank to go down for fear
[39:58.240 --> 40:00.880]  That they will bring other banks down
[40:00.880 --> 40:02.960]  So we're locked ourselves into this position
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.400]  Saying that the big mistake by central banks
[40:06.400 --> 40:09.200]  Was the move not to save banking
[40:09.200 --> 40:11.280]  But to save individual banks
[40:12.080 --> 40:13.840]  Corrigan stated ultimately yes
[40:13.840 --> 40:15.680]  If the banks don't restart
[40:15.680 --> 40:17.920]  The authorities will have to start acting
[40:17.920 --> 40:19.680]  As the monetizers of last resort
[40:19.680 --> 40:21.840]  They'll have to start dispensing commercial credit
[40:21.840 --> 40:23.840]  Between non-financial institutions
[40:23.840 --> 40:25.120]  And cut banking out of the loop
[40:26.800 --> 40:27.600]  If necessary
[40:28.320 --> 40:30.400]  As the George Washington blogspot documents
[40:30.400 --> 40:31.920]  The banks have openly stated
[40:31.920 --> 40:33.360]  That they will keep hoarding cash
[40:33.360 --> 40:35.360]  No matter how much money the Fed gives them
[40:36.960 --> 40:38.400]  Well that's the whole point
[40:38.400 --> 40:40.160]  I told you this years ago
[40:40.160 --> 40:41.200]  I told you this months ago
[40:41.200 --> 40:42.320]  I told you this weeks ago
[40:43.200 --> 40:44.640]  You're not going to get that money
[40:44.640 --> 40:47.120]  You're just going to pay to give it to the offshore banks
[40:47.120 --> 40:48.240]  You're going to pay
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.240]  So when your city goes bankrupt
[40:50.240 --> 40:51.840]  They've got lobbyists to come in
[40:52.400 --> 40:54.080]  And pay off your politicians
[40:54.080 --> 40:55.200]  Your money's going to come right back
[40:55.200 --> 40:56.400]  To pay off politicians
[40:56.400 --> 40:58.320]  To hand over infrastructure to the bankers
[40:58.320 --> 41:00.400]  So they can triple your tolls on those roads
[41:00.400 --> 41:02.800]  And then triple the price of your water
[41:02.800 --> 41:04.080]  And then everything
[41:05.120 --> 41:06.480]  And there are going to be more cops
[41:06.480 --> 41:07.520]  Writing more tickets
[41:08.320 --> 41:09.920]  And there's going to be more checkpoints
[41:10.480 --> 41:12.400]  And there's going to be more homes being taken
[41:12.400 --> 41:13.840]  And they're massively increasing
[41:13.840 --> 41:15.520]  The number of IRS enforcers now
[41:15.520 --> 41:16.800]  And giving them basically
[41:17.360 --> 41:18.400]  Homeland security
[41:19.040 --> 41:20.560]  Patriot Act powers
[41:20.560 --> 41:22.080]  Well not basically they are
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.600]  That was also in the banker bailout bill
[41:23.600 --> 41:25.120]  But in previous bills beefing it up
[41:25.120 --> 41:26.960]  Where they can, they're like CIA agents
[41:26.960 --> 41:28.000]  Just do whatever they want
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.480]  Of course, it's all on its face criminal
[41:32.000 --> 41:32.800]  It's lawless
[41:34.320 --> 41:37.200]  But these people are absolutely out of their minds
[41:40.000 --> 41:40.960]  And by out of their minds
[41:40.960 --> 41:42.000]  I mean out of their minds
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.200]  Just rather than us
[41:43.200 --> 41:44.560]  We're grabbing up everything
[41:44.560 --> 41:46.160]  I mean they consciously know what they're doing
[41:46.160 --> 41:47.840]  But it's still a form of insanity
[41:49.760 --> 41:51.520]  We're going to cover more of this later
[41:51.520 --> 41:53.920]  When we've got the treasury secretary
[41:53.920 --> 41:58.000]  The White House spokesperson
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.960]  The White House press secretary
[42:00.960 --> 42:03.120]  Talking about the treasury secretary
[42:04.160 --> 42:08.400]  And saying, well, we're not allowed to see
[42:08.400 --> 42:09.520]  Any of these documents
[42:11.360 --> 42:12.240]  But that's okay
[42:13.440 --> 42:16.320]  Because we just trust our treasury secretary
[42:16.320 --> 42:17.520]  All right, here's this video clip
[42:17.520 --> 42:19.280]  It's up on prisonplanet.com
[42:20.480 --> 42:21.760]  I sent it to you last week, John
[42:21.760 --> 42:22.480]  I forgot the title
[42:22.480 --> 42:24.560]  It's New World Order for Complete Idiots
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.600]  The Complete Idiots Guide to the New World Order
[42:29.600 --> 42:31.120]  And we'll play it and play the last few minutes
[42:31.120 --> 42:56.880]  In the next segment, stay with us
[42:56.880 --> 43:01.360]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society
[43:02.160 --> 43:03.360]  And we are as a people
[43:04.160 --> 43:08.800]  Apparently and historically opposed to secret societies
[43:08.800 --> 43:11.600]  To secret oaths and to secret proceedings
[43:12.560 --> 43:16.320]  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive
[43:16.320 --> 43:19.600]  And unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts
[43:19.600 --> 43:27.360]  Far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it
[43:38.880 --> 43:41.040]  On the outskirts of the National Capitol Day
[43:41.040 --> 43:43.280]  Black limousines with darkened windows
[43:43.280 --> 43:46.480]  Converged a hotel where private security guards
[43:46.480 --> 43:49.040]  Invose the iron flag control
[43:49.040 --> 43:52.480]  The limous carry royalty, political power brokers
[43:52.480 --> 43:55.360]  And industrial tightens to a secret meeting
[43:55.360 --> 43:57.360]  That will last all weekend
[43:57.360 --> 43:59.680]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group
[44:00.240 --> 44:02.560]  Could their objective be world domination?
[44:03.680 --> 44:05.760]  The Council on Foreign Relations
[44:10.240 --> 44:12.960]  Professor Carol Quickley is allowed to examine
[44:12.960 --> 44:17.040]  The confidential papers and secret records of this network
[44:17.040 --> 44:20.080]  Quickley reveals that these men aim to create
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.120]  A world system of financial control in private hands
[44:23.680 --> 44:26.720]  Able to dominate the political system of each country
[44:26.720 --> 44:28.720]  And the economy of the world as a whole
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.040]  In short, they seek total and quiet control
[44:35.360 --> 44:36.560]  Of the entire world
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.120]  And the CFR is their most visible conduit
[44:41.120 --> 44:42.800]  For carrying out that agenda
[44:44.640 --> 44:46.240]  What I'm about to say is fact
[44:47.600 --> 44:50.160]  The secret organizations of the world power elite
[44:50.160 --> 44:51.360]  Are no longer secret
[44:52.240 --> 44:54.240]  They have planned and are now leading us
[44:54.240 --> 44:56.480]  Into a one-world communist government
[44:57.120 --> 45:00.240]  CNN has even reported that these individuals
[45:00.240 --> 45:02.000]  Have put out the policy reports
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.600]  Through the Council on Foreign Relations
[45:03.600 --> 45:05.360]  That writes their scholarly white papers
[45:05.360 --> 45:09.200]  To end the United States, to end Canada, and to end Mexico
[45:09.200 --> 45:11.280]  I hate to break it to you, but after two years
[45:11.280 --> 45:13.360]  Of denying it and saying this can't be
[45:14.160 --> 45:16.160]  It's the only reason that I have found
[45:16.160 --> 45:17.920]  That explains everything that's going on
[45:17.920 --> 45:19.440]  In our country with a border
[45:19.440 --> 45:21.760]  Our country has been sold out in the name
[45:21.760 --> 45:24.560]  Of global profits and votes at the ballot box
[45:25.120 --> 45:27.680]  This is where the Security and Prosperity
[45:27.680 --> 45:30.320]  Partnership of North America or SPP comes in
[45:30.960 --> 45:33.440]  This little agreement, international agreement
[45:33.440 --> 45:36.480]  Cooked up by President Bush, the former President of Mexico
[45:36.480 --> 45:38.080]  And the Prime Minister of Canada
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.560]  Their mission is to blur or completely erase
[45:42.560 --> 45:45.440]  The borders between Canada, U.S. and Mexico
[45:45.440 --> 45:47.840]  The UNARO is the proposed new currency
[45:47.840 --> 45:49.520]  For the North American community
[45:49.520 --> 45:51.360]  Which is being developed right now
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.600]  Between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico
[45:53.600 --> 45:56.800]  To make a borderless community much like the EU
[45:56.800 --> 45:59.440]  And the dollar, Canadian dollar, U.S. dollar
[45:59.440 --> 46:01.680]  And the Mexican peso replaced by the UNARO
[46:01.680 --> 46:03.760]  Security and Prosperity Partnership
[46:03.760 --> 46:07.600]  Which critics call nothing more than a North American Union
[46:08.240 --> 46:11.040]  It brings open borders, commerce at all cost
[46:11.600 --> 46:14.720]  And by the way, without the approval of either
[46:14.720 --> 46:17.280]  American voters or the U.S. Congress
[46:17.280 --> 46:19.600]  I think they're important to me like the euro, dollar, you mean?
[46:20.240 --> 46:22.160]  Well, that would be a long, long term
[46:22.160 --> 46:25.440]  Even the economists supporting the so-called globalism
[46:25.440 --> 46:26.560]  And it's not free trade
[46:26.560 --> 46:28.880]  Worse, critics say foreign policy elites
[46:28.880 --> 46:31.360]  Are promoting a European-style union
[46:31.360 --> 46:33.680]  Erasing borders between the three countries
[46:33.680 --> 46:36.480]  And eventually moving to a single North American currency
[46:36.480 --> 46:37.200]  Called the AMERA
[46:37.200 --> 46:40.640]  Via a 4,000-mile network of new toll roads
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.200]  With trucking, car lanes, rail lines, pipeline and utility zones
[46:45.200 --> 46:50.160]  It's projected cost $183 billion over 50 years
[47:01.680 --> 47:03.040]  By default of this agreement
[47:03.040 --> 47:06.000]  The American Constitution will eventually be obsolete
[47:06.800 --> 47:08.720]  You would think that a situation like this
[47:08.720 --> 47:11.520]  Would be on the cover of every major newspaper
[47:11.520 --> 47:14.560]  That is until you realize that the people who are behind this movement
[47:14.560 --> 47:17.040]  Are the same people behind the mainstream media
[47:17.040 --> 47:19.120]  And you are not told what you're not supposed to know
[47:19.760 --> 47:22.960]  The North American Union is the same concept as the European Union
[47:22.960 --> 47:25.760]  The African Union and the soon-to-be Asian Union
[47:25.760 --> 47:28.080]  And the same people are behind all of them
[47:28.080 --> 47:31.840]  And, at the time is right, the North American Union, the European Union
[47:31.840 --> 47:35.760]  The African Union and the Asian Union will be merged together
[47:35.760 --> 47:39.840]  Vice President Dick Cheney takes a question from David Rockefeller
[47:39.840 --> 47:43.920]  Vice President, I just put so much your whole speech
[47:43.920 --> 47:48.240]  But I was particularly pleased that you gave such a strong endorsement
[47:48.240 --> 47:50.800]  For the free trade agreement for all the Americans
[47:51.680 --> 47:54.400]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations
[47:54.400 --> 47:57.680]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time
[47:57.680 --> 48:00.400]  And was actually a director for some period of time
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.720]  But I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming
[48:07.360 --> 48:10.880]  I'm, you know, I've never registered as a Republican, but generally speaking
[48:10.880 --> 48:16.560]  But I think most Americans now say, on either side, they're both selling us out
[48:16.560 --> 48:33.520]  I was one who supported an incredible push to get authority, if necessary, to use force
[48:33.520 --> 48:34.800]  And to down the drain
[48:38.880 --> 48:41.360]  Well, I have a number of people from whom I get to policy
[48:41.360 --> 48:43.680]  I'm talking to Frank Gaffney, I talk to Richard Haas
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.840]  And Richard Haas served under Colin Powell during this push administration
[48:47.840 --> 48:48.880]  Over at the State Department
[48:48.880 --> 48:51.520]  He's now the President of the Council on Foreign Relations
[49:09.200 --> 49:12.480]  I actually had the idea of a one-world community, a new world order
[49:12.480 --> 49:13.760]  You know, they see that
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.600]  They see themselves as a government as opposed to a group of well-leaders or people with influence
[49:17.600 --> 49:20.400]  At a global level who are talking about global issues, do they?
[49:20.400 --> 49:22.480]  They see themselves as headhunters
[49:22.480 --> 49:28.240]  They'll get an up-and-coming politician who they think may be President or Prime Minister one day
[49:28.240 --> 49:32.720]  And as globalist, industrialist leaders who believe that politics
[49:32.720 --> 49:34.480]  Shouldn't be in the hands of the politicians
[49:34.480 --> 49:38.240]  People talk to me about, you know, the issue of Republican versus Democrat
[49:38.240 --> 49:39.120]  Is if they don't get it
[49:39.120 --> 49:40.800]  And I say, look, here's the way you get it
[49:40.800 --> 49:42.800]  It's organized crime
[49:42.800 --> 49:46.160]  All you do is you call the Republicans, the Genoveses
[49:46.160 --> 49:48.480]  And you call the Democrats, the Gambinos
[49:48.480 --> 49:51.680]  The people at the top, they treat it like a crap game
[49:51.680 --> 49:52.880]  Like it's their crap game
[49:52.880 --> 49:54.400]  Like they're making lots of money
[49:54.400 --> 49:57.120]  Occasionally somebody at the table shoots each other
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.160]  But the moment anything threatens their crap game
[50:00.160 --> 50:02.000]  They all unite to protect it
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  They're both controlled by the same financial, economic and corporate interests
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.520]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations
[50:12.160 --> 50:13.360]  A new world order
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations
[50:21.200 --> 50:23.840]  When we are successful, and we will be
[50:24.720 --> 50:27.680]  We have a real chance at this new world order
[50:27.680 --> 50:29.120]  It used to be more secretive
[50:29.120 --> 50:32.640]  You know, the new world order was talked about 30 or 40 years ago
[50:32.640 --> 50:34.480]  And nobody would say it out and open
[50:34.480 --> 50:36.640]  But now they talk about the new world order
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.080]  Or they just think the world would be better off if we had one world order
[50:40.080 --> 50:43.280]  I don't, I mean, I don't even like the size of our federal government, let alone the local government
[50:43.280 --> 50:44.080]  All right, stay there
[50:45.280 --> 50:48.080]  Stay there, we're gonna come back, finish up the last few minutes of this
[50:48.080 --> 50:49.520]  Get into a bunch of other news
[50:50.400 --> 50:55.680]  And later we are gonna be having Navintura and Dean Barkley pop in about election
[50:56.640 --> 51:00.960]  And a lot more, and then Selik Estella convicted three years

[52:01.040 --> 52:04.320]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[52:04.320 --> 52:07.760]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[52:07.760 --> 52:09.840]  The enemies struck America on September 11th
[52:10.400 --> 52:12.000]  But who is the enemy?
[52:12.000 --> 52:12.800]  Bin Laden
[52:12.800 --> 52:13.920]  This is his ammo
[52:13.920 --> 52:15.120]  We have to look to the Middle East
[52:15.120 --> 52:17.200]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[52:17.200 --> 52:22.560]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[52:22.560 --> 52:24.320]  Inside the United States
[52:24.320 --> 52:27.280]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[52:27.280 --> 52:30.480]  Very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:31.120 --> 52:34.880]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[52:34.880 --> 52:36.720]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[52:36.720 --> 52:38.720]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[52:38.720 --> 52:40.160]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[52:40.160 --> 52:41.840]  The Israeli intelligence network

[54:04.640 --> 54:06.000]  Day after day
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.760]  Alone on a hill
[54:11.360 --> 54:13.760]  The man with the foolish grin
[54:13.760 --> 54:16.880]  Is keeping perfectly still
[54:18.080 --> 54:21.040]  But nobody wants to know him
[54:21.040 --> 54:23.600]  They can see that he's just a fool
[54:24.880 --> 54:27.600]  And he never gives an answer
[54:27.600 --> 54:30.960]  But the fool on the hill
[54:30.960 --> 54:34.320]  Sees the sun going down
[54:34.320 --> 54:37.600]  And the eyes in his head
[54:37.600 --> 54:41.360]  See the world spring round
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.240]  We've been mainly playing clips of big time presidents,
[54:44.240 --> 54:47.200]  prime ministers calling for a new world order or discussions up in the news,
[54:47.200 --> 54:53.840]  but there are thousands of clips of professors and university heads and bankers and think tanks
[54:53.840 --> 54:58.400]  in the UN and the club of Rome and the CFR and trilateral commission
[54:59.120 --> 55:02.640]  and books written by German chancellors and British prime ministers.
[55:02.640 --> 55:06.640]  I mean, just openly admitting how they run everything, how they do it.
[55:06.640 --> 55:08.320]  I mean, it's all stated by them.
[55:08.320 --> 55:13.440]  Yeah, it's like I read a TV guide here on there every day and tell you what's going to be on TV
[55:13.440 --> 55:16.560]  and people are like, oh, is it true or how does he know all this?
[55:16.560 --> 55:19.360]  I mean, it's not even hard. It's just all admitted.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.200]  Let's finish up with this clip.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  Within the next four years, we will see the emergence of a new international order.
[55:30.000 --> 55:39.600]  But there's a very, very clear cut and easily identifiable system in place that puts all of these
[55:39.600 --> 55:45.040]  elements from media control to government control to energy control together into one apparatus
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.000]  working together effectively towards its final goal, which is global control.
[55:50.880 --> 55:55.840]  A new world is emerging. It is a new world order.
[55:55.840 --> 55:59.680]  It's a phrase that I often use myself that we needed a new world order.
[55:59.680 --> 56:04.400]  There is a chance for the president of the United States to use this disaster
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.840]  to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used, and that is a new world order.
[56:09.840 --> 56:15.840]  They're inside a cabal conspiracy theory to take control of the United States,
[56:15.840 --> 56:18.320]  lead us into a one-world government run by them.
[56:19.680 --> 56:22.800]  Americans in the park expect their salvation from government
[56:22.800 --> 56:29.760]  instead of recognizing government as the most dangerous threat they'll face in their lives.
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.240]  All right, folks. While I'm playing that clip, I'm talking to Ventura right now.
[56:36.480 --> 56:37.600]  Jesse, I'll call you right back.
[56:39.600 --> 56:45.440]  I tell you, folks, I'm in here doing production because I was working out that guest.
[56:45.440 --> 56:51.280]  It was so I'm here playing clips and doing production here on the phone while I'm at it.
[56:54.800 --> 56:58.160]  I need to go ahead and call Ventura back and then call Dean Barkley,
[56:58.160 --> 57:00.080]  and I guess go ahead and get those guys on.
[57:03.680 --> 57:05.360]  We'll go ahead and do it about eight after.
[57:07.520 --> 57:10.320]  That's why this radio show has such total transparency now.
[57:10.320 --> 57:16.720]  We don't have time to even cut liners separately from the live show, so we do it on the radio.
[57:18.320 --> 57:22.480]  We do behind the scenes now. Most of the times we're live on video, even during the breaks.
[57:23.120 --> 57:26.800]  And it's kind of neat, though, but people can get an idea of what really goes on around here
[57:26.800 --> 57:28.480]  and how we're flying by the seat of our pants.
[57:28.480 --> 57:30.480]  I don't know how the idea has gotten out there.
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.840]  I'm like some super mastermind brainiac and we're all slick and all-knowing and
[57:35.840 --> 57:41.200]  all-controlling the Patriot movement when I'm always actually trying to control
[57:42.320 --> 57:44.960]  the dog not getting out of the fence and getting run over.
[57:48.560 --> 57:57.680]  I'm trying to control dealing with my taxes and trying to control dealing with heartburn.
[58:01.040 --> 58:03.040]  There's so much news and information coming up.
[58:03.040 --> 58:11.280]  I'm going to go ahead and I shouldn't have gotten off the phone with Ventura because
[58:12.160 --> 58:15.840]  I needed to finish that, but I was kind of caught there with the flip ending.
[58:15.840 --> 58:32.640]  So we'll come back and we will get Ventura and them on the show. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[58:32.640 --> 58:48.160]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.280 --> 58:56.240]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[58:56.240 --> 58:58.560]  9-11 was an inside job.
[58:58.560 --> 59:01.360]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.680]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you,
[59:05.680 --> 59:08.480]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.P.R.?
[59:17.520 --> 59:22.480]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:23.680 --> 59:27.200]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:27.200 --> 59:33.840]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:33.840 --> 59:36.560]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:36.560 --> 59:42.080]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[59:42.080 --> 59:48.160]  Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:48.160 --> 59:58.320]  It's now time to take the revolution at the next level.
[1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:30.320]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:44.960]  Okay, folks. We've got Jesse Ventura coming up in the next segment.
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:49.920]  And we'll briefly talk about the great time we had here in Austin for almost four hours with
[1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:53.840]  Willie Nelson out of his ranch and then some of the live reports we did out there from the event.
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:57.440]  And we're not sure if some of that went out over the web. They had kind of a bad internet connection
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:03.760]  out there, but we've got the tapes and it's all going to go on the internet. But we're mainly
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:08.560]  talking about the election and several other issues and Dean Barkley and the chance he's got
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:15.040]  to win the Senate up there. So that is coming up and then Celica Stillo falsely accused and set up
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:19.840]  by the VATF, you know, the former DEA agent who blew the whistle on government drug dealing,
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:25.840]  one of many, but one of the most prominent, one of the first big ones. So he'll be coming up and
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:34.480]  joining us in about two hours from now. He was convicted three years in prison. And so that is
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:39.360]  coming up. Earlier, I played a clip of all these world leaders and others calling for a new world
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:43.520]  order, world government. It's all over the news today, but they're just intensifying the call
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:46.800]  for the bankers around everything. And they're saying, you don't have a choice. We'll destroy
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:50.560]  the economy if you don't give us total power. And meanwhile, when they're given the total power,
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:57.280]  they just squeeze even tighter. They're just completely ruthless. So that is coming up.
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:03.600]  But John, pull up renegades because I need to give you the number for Ventura and line that up.
[1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:07.120]  And let's go out of this break. We're about a minute with renegades,
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:15.360]  or we can play that Mattis Hell clip you put together, or one of those. And in fact,
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:19.680]  that's probably a good one to play. And then we'll get our guest on. I'm a little bit
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:27.520]  a little bit bumpy today, because I went to bed about 130. And I got up at 455.
[1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:32.080]  Go pick Ventura up and take him to the airport for a slide out at seven. They had headwinds.
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:36.480]  That's why he's late. And it took him four hours to get back instead of two and a half down here.
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:41.520]  Boy, headwind can really do that. John, we're going to go out of break here with renegades
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:51.360]  while we get our next guest lined up. Stay with us.
[1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:21.360]  Others couldn't stand for that. Cross was a solution, but it rose again.
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:34.480]  Wise men followed him, but it rose again. Wise men followed him. Thank God for the renegades.
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:54.320]  Wise men followed him, but it rose again. Wise men followed him. Thank God for the renegades.
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:16.880]  They railed against the crowd. Another red tag bet. Declaring independence.
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:31.920]  Ain't their bodies there? Only bloody war and liberty for their descendants.
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:41.920]  Thanks to the renegades. We're free today. Thanks to the renegades. We're free today.
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:50.560]  Thank God for the renegades. And the lights they need for our hero.
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:05:11.200]  Thank God for the renegades. And the lights they need for our hero.
[1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:39.200]  Thanks to the renegades. We're free today.
[1:05:50.560 --> 1:06:07.040]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:13.360]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:17.680]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:21.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:26.720]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:33.600]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:39.280]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:43.520]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:49.200]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com,
[1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:54.560]  or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:06:54.560 --> 1:07:14.240]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:29.200]  I am blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:32.720]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:35.920]  healthier I feel. I recommend part and body extract to everyone.
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:41.600]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative

[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:23.840]  Previously, we are really getting to spend a few days with him, and ride around all over
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:27.120]  Texas with him and hang out for almost four hours yesterday with Willie Nelson out at his
[1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:33.520]  ranch. Last night doing a live report about there at that event that had so many bands,
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:38.400]  so many people crammed into it, the last day at the backyard. It was wonderful.
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:42.960]  We'll spend a few minutes on that, and Jesse's overall view on the election and the t-shirt
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:47.600]  he was wearing yesterday that I think said it all succinctly. Then we're going to talk about
[1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:52.160]  somebody who is actually trying to take action and who was there at the Ron Paul campaign for
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:59.200]  liberty, somebody who is pro-liberty, pro-freedom. The other two are bad to worse with the Republican
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:05.520]  and the Democrat that Dean Barkley is running against the Minnesota. This is a chance to get
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:12.000]  the guy that got Jesse Ventura into politics, a guy that according to what Jesse's been telling
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.800]  me is just the best thing since sliced bread into the Senate. It's a close race. We're going to be
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:22.480]  talking about that in a few minutes, but first off, governor, I just dropped you off at 555 at
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:27.360]  the airport, and here we are again. Yeah, Alex, I feel like you're in my back pocket.
[1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.600]  I've been together with you so much. No, the flight got delayed a little bit, and so I got
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:38.080]  into Minneapolis a little later than expected. I didn't actually touch down on the ground until
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:43.280]  about a little over an hour ago. And you had some headwinds too, didn't you? Yeah, I think so. It
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:48.640]  must have been because, like I said, it got delayed about 15 at Aston, and then it actually ended up
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:53.040]  at the lay of about 40 flying through the air, so there must have been some pretty good winds up
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:57.040]  there. Well, your flight was a little bit, you know, but it's a good flight because you walk away
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:01.680]  from it. Well, your flight was 30 minutes early getting here, so I guess you had tailwinds then.
[1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:06.640]  Well, bottom line, you got back safe, and we appreciate you coming down. Hey, what was that?
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:12.160]  I mean, you've been on at Willie's place before, but we got the grand treatment this time.
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:18.320]  Yeah. That was pretty amazing. Oh, it was a lot of fun. You know, Willie owns a beautiful ranch
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:23.760]  down there in Austin. He sits right on top of the hill, a view from his place is just breathtaking,
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:30.560]  and you know, and his place is very uniquely built, so architecturally and all that, so it's a lot
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:35.200]  of fun to walk around it and see it, and then of course he's got his whole western town out there
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:39.440]  that you can spend time in. It's like walking onto the set of Gunsmoke,
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:46.240]  and so going to Willie's is always an adventure. You know, he's a terrific guy and one heck of
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:51.040]  a talent. Of course, I'm speaking in a choir because, you know, everybody in Texas knows that
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:56.080]  well and around the country knows it well, but he's just a basic guy. What I love about Willie's,
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:02.720]  for all the fame and fortune that Willie has, he's still a down-to-earth type guy who really has
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:08.080]  feelings for the regular human being out there, and you can tell it by what Willie does, you know,
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:14.320]  with all of his farm-aid. He's always out to help people. In fact, that's probably one of his problems
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:19.040]  is he always tries to help people too much, you know, and he gets caught up in all the things
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:22.880]  that he's doing all the time, and I'm sure it's difficult to keep it all straight for him.
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:29.280]  Yeah, certainly, certainly a lot of stuff going on. Shifting gears into the election
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:35.840]  overall, tell us about that t-shirt. Oh, well, I actually got that t-shirt I was wearing in
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:43.360]  in Arizona when I was out there due to 9-11 for the anniversary out there, and it's a big red
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:49.680]  t-shirt at the top, the white lettering. It says 2008 election, and it's got McCain with a box,
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:56.560]  Obama with a box, and anyone but with a box. And on this particular t-shirt,
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:02.480]  anyone but has the check mark, not Obama and not McCain, anyone but.
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:09.680]  And that's kind of how I feel, Alex, because I won't vote Democrat. I won't vote Republican.
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:15.280]  They're the ones that have gotten us into this economical mess. I think I said it before on
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:21.760]  your show. I'll say it again. Nobody in these two parties paid attention to that federal deficit.
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:27.360]  They're still not paying attention to that federal deficit, and we cannot have a vibrant
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:34.400]  economy when you have that type of debt hanging over your head constantly. They must cut government
[1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:40.720]  spending. They must do that in which to get rid of that debt, and once they get rid of that debt,
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.840]  the economy and the value of the dollar will start coming back. You've had more time now. I mean,
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:49.520]  you were against it from day one, but you've had more time to look at the bailout. I've got the New
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:55.680]  York Times, Senator Dodd today. Senator predicts revolution if banks don't lend. That's the New
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:00.800]  York Times. He says that they're hoarding the money. They're not even giving it out to get
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:08.640]  the economy going. Well, then why did we give it to them? It's unbelievable. It's our money,
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:13.600]  and it's supposed to come back to us, isn't it? I mean, I don't understand the whole thing to begin
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:20.160]  with. It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Absolutely. And I mean, it's confusing because
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:25.920]  it's our money. So in other words, we're giving our money to the government who's giving it to
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:31.120]  the banks who then are supposed to give it back to us. Yeah, let me read the quote. This is Senator
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:35.920]  Dodd, New York Times Sunday. If it turns out they're hoarding, you'll have a revolution on your hands.
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:40.400]  People will be so livid and furious that their tax money is going to line their pockets instead
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:45.120]  of doing the right thing. They will be held to pay. Dodd told the New York Times this weekend.
[1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:52.240]  Well, you know, Alex, it doesn't surprise me because has George Bush done anything right yet?
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:58.640]  Well, he's done stuff right for his buddies, but no. No, no, no. I mean, for the country and in his
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:04.240]  job, I can't think of one thing that he's done right yet. So why would I think that all of a
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:10.080]  sudden he will do something right when he's only got a couple months to go until he jumps ship
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:17.360]  and leaves us all on this big sinking ship that people hold into. I'm laughing, but I'm almost
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:24.480]  crying here. No, it's pathetic. You do want to cry about it. But I mean, you know, I urge everybody
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:32.880]  that people may not be an Oliver Stone fan, but go see the movie W because it'll show you really
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:39.280]  kind of a, in its own way, a bit of a sarcastic look on Bush's life. And you see that everything
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:45.200]  he did, he left in disarray. Everything. Yeah, well, he's certainly a puppet. Before we get
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:49.600]  into Dean Barkley, I want to get into that in just a minute. You know, you never said vote for
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:53.120]  Barack Obama, but I remember about eight months ago here on the show, you said, because he was
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:56.640]  saying he was going to get us out of the war. He was going to say no to wiretapping. And you said,
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:01.760]  look out, Barack Obama, look out for assassination. But now it seems you've soured towards him
[1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:08.480]  even more in the interviews we did. Oh, well, because he, he's already punching the lack of
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:14.800]  better term. You know, now it's well, we're not going to immediately leave Iraq. And now it's well,
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:20.240]  you know, we're not going to do this. We're not going to do that. See, he's getting caught up into
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:27.440]  the same two party quagmire or the two party dictatorship that we now live under. And, and
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:34.480]  all I, I'll be the first one. And I hope that I'm Alex, I hope I can say I'm wrong. I hope I can
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:40.320]  come on your show a year or two from now and say, you know, I was wrong, Alex, because I'll admit
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:46.240]  when I'm wrong, I have no problem with that. I'm not a perfect person. And I hope I can do it.
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:52.080]  But I, all these people that think this massive change is going to take place because you're
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:58.400]  now going to elect a Democrat. I got news for you people. Democrats have been getting elected
[1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:04.560]  for a long, long time and nothing changes. They've been in there since 2006. The war's still going.
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:10.960]  That's right. And there's not any hint that we're getting out any sooner or anything of that nature.
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:17.680]  You know, it becomes, it's laughable to the point you want to cry. Now, there is a silver,
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:22.320]  there is a silver lining to all this. Let's get into Senator because he was there for a month or so
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:28.240]  after Wellstone's tragic death and that plane crash. Dean Barkley, tell us about this guy and
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:32.960]  it's a close race and we're coming down here in the last eight, nine days. Dean is sitting right
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:37.920]  now. Dean, let me put it to this way for you and all your listeners, Alex. There would be no
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:44.880]  Governor Jesse Ventura without Dean Barkley, Senator Dean Barkley, because he was the guy up
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:50.160]  here in Minnesota that went out on the line before I ever got involved much in politics.
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:56.480]  And he ran and got my party, the independence party, the third party movement of Minnesota going
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:03.120]  by gaining, he got enough votes and he busted his butt that he got us in our state. If you get over
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:11.920]  5% of the statewide vote, that then makes you major party. You then achieve major party status.
[1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:17.520]  Well, coming along with major party status generally means you get to participate in the
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:24.640]  debates, which is essential. Like at the national level, they hold the bar there at about 15 or
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:32.880]  20% to keep any third party from debating. And even when Ross Perot got damned 19.7%, if you
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:38.640]  remember, they didn't even let him in the debates in 96 after he got one out of five votes because
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:43.840]  they raised the bar even higher again. Well, in Minnesota, fortunately, when you get 5%,
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:50.560]  if you achieve that, then you're allowed in the debates pretty much. There have been exceptions
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:55.360]  where they have excluded people. But that's good. One of them was the reason I named Dean
[1:17:55.360 --> 1:18:00.880]  Barkley a senator because when Senator Wellstone was killed in the plane crash,
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:06.720]  I was going to name the winner of the election so that they would have seniority,
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:12.000]  but then they, when Walter Mondale, the Democrat, came in to replace Wellstone,
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:18.880]  he would not debate unless our candidate was excluded and they did it. So then I got angry,
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:24.720]  I thought, how dare them? How can they exclude the party that the seated governor belongs to?
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:30.400]  So that was at the point that I named Dean Barkley the US senator, which he was the most
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:36.240]  productive senator in four weeks in Minnesota history for the four weeks that he was in Washington
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:42.400]  until, you know, the end of the year. But he is now running and Alex, he's right in the position
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:48.320]  I was in. He's polling a little over 20% with a week to go. That's right where I was at.
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:53.120]  And he needs some funding. This is a guy, we don't take PAC money. We don't take special
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:59.200]  interest money. We don't have a national party. So we're at an extreme disadvantage.
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:05.600]  And I'm appealing to all your listeners out there. It's Senator Barkley.com over the internet.
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:10.800]  This is a guy like Dr. Paul. He's the independent. He believes in the Constitution.
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:18.800]  And we've got to break this two party and he needs to raise about 35,000 to 50,000 by Wednesday.
[1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:24.160]  Because he's got the TV ads and to explain it's a three way race. He's only like five points
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:29.680]  behind. Well, no, he's about 10 behind, but that don't mean nothing in the last week,
[1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:34.800]  because there's 30% of Minnesotans that still say they're undecided.
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:38.240]  Yeah, I was talking to him this morning about that. So we have a chance to get him in.
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:44.480]  Yes, we do. If people will step forward, this is a critical event if they can help Dean out.
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:47.360]  Because he's already got what he was telling me like a hundred and something thousand for the
[1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:52.640]  TV ads. He needs another 30 to 40. He'll be able to run the full package. And I think he said he
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:58.000]  spent like a hundred thousand and they spent millions and he's close to being able to beat him.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:00.720]  We're going to come back and talk to Jesse Ventura and Mr. Barkley.
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:05.600]  The economy is collapsing all around us. Banks are closing. The Fed Reserve continues to pump

[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:05.680]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national

[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:11.840]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, hot on the heels of being down here in Austin,
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:20.880]  told me, look, this guy is great. This guy, you know, is part of the Ron Paul Liberty deal. He
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:24.960]  was there. He's a constitutionalist. He's the guy that got me into government. He's the guy that
[1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:30.880]  lays the trail. We need to get him in. And the key here is Jesse Ventura was 10 points behind
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:35.520]  a week before the election. He was eight points behind going into the weekend of the election
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:40.320]  and he won because you got 30 plus percent or around 30 percent that are undecided.
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:46.880]  This is key and both parties are very unpopular right now. I want to bring Dean Barkley up to
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.680]  explain how much more money they've spent compared to what he spent and some of the things we can
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:58.080]  do to help him. But Governor Ventura, before we bring Senator Barkley in, finish up with the
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:04.960]  key point. I mean, you were there. You lived it about the similarities to your race and his race
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:13.360]  right now. Well, the similarities are great. I mean, our slogan back in 98 was retaliate in 98.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:20.720]  And I would tell you with the way the public sentiment is today, it would be double retaliate
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:26.880]  in 08 because the people today, to me, are twice as angry as they were back in 98 when
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:33.200]  they elected me. And they need to act upon that anger and that anger needs to be shown to the
[1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:40.320]  two parties. You know, this would be a bombshell across the nation. If Dean Barkley upset Senator
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:47.520]  Norm Coleman and comedian Al Franken, it will be a shockwave the same as mine was. You all
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:53.520]  remember when I won back in 98, how they were so stunned. I think Dan Rather said it would be
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:59.760]  more popular to see Fidel Castro riding across the Rocky Mountains or something than Jesse
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:06.400]  Ventura winning the governor of Minnesota. Well, we can do that same type of explosion right now
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:13.360]  and it'll happen next week. And believe me, it would be like a hard, hard left jab right to the
[1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:19.120]  nose of both of these parties and it would cause their eyes to glass and they wouldn't know what
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:24.400]  hit them if we can do this. If we could elect Dean Barkley and send him as the new U.S. Senator
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:28.800]  from Minnesota, an independent. Yeah, one senator can do a lot. I mean, look what one congressman
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:36.800]  like Ron Paul can do and Ventura. Well, especially Alex, especially in the case of the Senate,
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:42.160]  because they're very, very close. Now, it appears the Dems may get a wider margin, but
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:47.680]  you know, Dean Barkley going out there could would be a very strong power broker because
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:53.280]  he would be a bargaining chip for both of these sides would have to, he would be a very powerful
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:58.320]  position to be in. And he's already been there. The Senate seat that I was going to go for. Yes,
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:03.360]  and no doubt you would have one of you to go on for it, but. Well, I don't know. Oh, come on,
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:07.200]  Ventura. Hey, but I understand you got a lot of stuff on the burner and we talked about,
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:10.800]  we can't talk about now that is going to be even probably more effective. We're glad Dean's doing
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:16.640]  it. Bringing up Dean Barkley, who was appointed Senator for a month and Wellstone's death. So
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:23.600]  he's been there before. Sir, how do we help you and how do we raise this money to get these ads
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:28.400]  on? Well, we're at a tipping point right now. You know, both my opponents have spent over $30
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:34.320]  million each, 30 million. And I've spent about $50,000 so far and I'm within the range to beat
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:38.960]  these guys. We've got to do our TV campaign. It's going to start running on Thursday and we need
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:44.000]  to raise enough money to have the impact. Just like Jesse did the last weekend of the campaign,
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:49.120]  we ran his ads and that convinced people that I could win and work very, very close right now.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:55.200]  If they want to send money, go to my website, which is www.SenatorBarkley.com. Or if they
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:28:02.720]  want to call my office into a donation that way, the phone number is 763-417-9972. You know,
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:07.440]  with another $50,000 or $60,000, I can win this race. It's winnable. And Jesse's right.
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:11.920]  Uh, this would be a shockwave that Congress would pay attention to. Say, my God,
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:15.360]  Barkley's coming here. If we don't change our ways, maybe we're going to be next.
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:19.200]  Well, the bully pulled back into this. Well, the bully pulled, but you would have as well.
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:23.040]  And again, here's Ventura still fighting. I mean, he didn't run, but he's
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:27.680]  supporting you and you supported him successfully for governor. So you're about 10 points behind
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:32.160]  both these clowns with 30. Now I've seen some polls. Is it 30 or is it 34%
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:40.240]  The last poll, the one was at 37. The other one is at 34. And I'm sitting around 20 to 21.
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:46.720]  22 somewhere in their range with a huge undecided, just a huge, and both my opponent's negatives
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:51.920]  are well over 50%. Nobody likes them. And I just have to get to the other people that are making
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:56.560]  up their mind right now of who I am. Get my message out there. Because everywhere I go,
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:29:01.680]  people hear me talk, I convert them, but I've only got about a week to go. And this TV campaign
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:06.880]  is going to be essential for me to actually tip this one and actually win it just like Jesse did.
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.520]  And Texas has a great chance. I mean, I spent a year and a half down there with Kinky Freedman.
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:17.040]  I think Austin is my adopted home. I love Austin, but here's your chance. I'll say Texas will be
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:22.720]  my adopted state. This is good for the entire country. I mean, this, we need to change this
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:29.280]  country. We're all over. We're on in, you know, Illinois, California, Kansas, Missouri, Florida,
[1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:35.680]  New York. This would be a strike for the entire country. We know how rotten politics has gotten.
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:39.920]  We know how Congress can't get anything done anymore as our country's going to hell.
[1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:43.920]  Senator Dean Barclay, Governor Jesse Ventura, stay there. We're going to come back and go to both
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:49.920]  of you and talk about this. $50,000. He's only 10 points behind the other two students with 37%
[1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:58.240]  undecided. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:06.080]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:10.480]  Of course not. But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:14.880]  and circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing. I'm Walt Augustino. It's

[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:29.040]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card

[1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:34.640]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[1:31:34.640 --> 1:31:40.160]  detained. From Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:44.400]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government,

[1:32:06.800 --> 1:32:13.520]  at $299. Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:18.800]  alike to sterilize homes and cars making them free from bacteria, moles, viruses, and complete
[1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:23.840]  removal of secondhand smoke. Pet owners, you name it. What else can three oxygen atoms, in other
[1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:29.200]  words, ozone do? Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after
[1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:34.400]  operations. And have you ever heard of ozone therapy? Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:40.080]  ozone therapy. Ozone therapy is used among other things to raise the body's oxygen level, which
[1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:45.520]  study suggests boosts the immune system. You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone

[1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:14.960]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., four hours, central standard time,
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:21.920]  that's noon to 4 p.m. Eastern. We are here live. Simulcasting on a growing wonderful list of
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:27.760]  AM and FM affiliates, going out on three different satellite systems, Global, Shortwave,
[1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:32.880]  and the number one radio talk show on the internet, on free internet shows, if you go to the
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:36.640]  shout-cast ranking. There's some music above us, but we're the number one radio talk show.
[1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:44.000]  And we are very honored to have Senator Dean Barkley there for a month appointed by the governor
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:50.640]  after Senator Wellstone's tragic death. And of course, the dark horse candidate that won
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:55.680]  and really changed history in the electoral process, Governor Jesse Ventura,
[1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:00.880]  former Governor Jesse Ventura from Minnesota. Jesse, we're talking during the break. There's
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:07.200]  another key point. Not only is 37 to 34% undecided, depending on the poll,
[1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:13.520]  and not only were you 10 points behind just like Dean is going in a week and a half before the
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:21.680]  election, but something else happened that parallels this. I mean, this is key because
[1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:25.600]  folks need to understand, Dean Barkley has a big chance of winning and people take action. Tell
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:33.520]  them, Governor. Well, again, across this whole country right now, to me, if you're angry and
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:39.520]  you're angry at the situation that our nation is in today, you have only two people, two entities
[1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:45.520]  to blame for that. That is the Democrats and the Republicans, because they're the ones that have
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:50.480]  put our country in the position it's in today. They're the ones that are trying to get us out
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:55.920]  with bailouts and all of this other stuff that they're doing for problems that they created
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:02.720]  and caused. And we've got to step forward. This is an opportunity to shoot a shot that'll be heard
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:08.640]  around the world to steal the crochet. Because trust me, if Dean Barkley gets elected up here,
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:14.560]  it will grab headlines just as much as whichever one of these two wins the presidency. I know
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:20.640]  I've been there. I remember 98 like it was like yesterday. You know, when I won that election
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:25.920]  and the same thing will happen in this one. If an independent beats these two parties,
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:30.720]  it will scare the bejesus out of them. That's the best way I can put it.
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:35.520]  Break down the numbers that you were telling me during the break about how more people voted
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:42.000]  than they had also guesstimated they would. Well, what happened in Minnesota going into
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:48.080]  and Dean's ahead of this, you were talking going into the final weekend. Going into the final weekend,
[1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:58.400]  I was at 20, I think 26 or 27% right in there. And they anticipated a 50% voter turnout. Well,
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:07.440]  they didn't anticipate it ended up 60%. And those were the 10% that took me from 27 to 37.
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:14.240]  And that's how I won. Well, right now they're predicting it could be as high as an 80% voter
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:20.320]  turnout. And everyone remember this that traditionally Minnesota leads the nation in voter turnout.
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:27.120]  It's always a battle between us and Maine. And ironically, when I was governor, there was another
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:33.360]  independent governor. His name was Governor Angus King of Maine. And Angus was actually on his
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:39.120]  second term when I started my first, I just got a lot more publicity than he did for whatever
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:45.760]  I suppose my background and all of that. But but notice that the states with the largest voter
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:52.240]  turnouts are the ones where you get a third candidate elected, because these two parties do
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:58.480]  not want you voting. They tell you that they do. But the reality is they don't because smaller
[1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:07.680]  numbers are easier to control. Absolutely. Dean, I mean, obviously you're doing a lot of radio
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:13.040]  interviews every day. You're doing some TV. These TV ads are key people need to go to
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:21.120]  Senator Barkley.com www.dean or www.Senator Barkley.com or just Google Dean Barkley,
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:28.080]  and you'll find his site that way. Or you can call the Senator Dean Barkley headquarters
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:41.840]  at 1763-417-9972 1763-417-9972. You know, he supported Ron Paul. He broke all those records,
[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:46.400]  woke up tens of millions of people in the New World Order. But you know, at the end of the day,
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:51.360]  he failed there in the big presidential run. But this is a state run for Senator. This is a
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:56.240]  battleground that Governor Ventura and Dean Barkley that trailblazed for for the governor.
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:02.880]  This is a chance for the American people to send a message that we are sick and tired of both parties.
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:09.680]  So here's that number 763-417-9972. And that again, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:15.840]  is Senator Dean Barkley, Senator Barkley.com. And Alex, if I can throw in there, remember,
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:26.080]  in Dean and I's candidacies, most of our contributions are 50 and 100 dollars, 20 bucks, 25 bucks. We
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:31.920]  welcome that because we don't spend like these other two parties do. We don't win elections
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:37.840]  by money. We win them with ideas, but certainly you have to have some money in which to get your
[1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:44.560]  ideas out there. And that's how we win. So I want to tell people any, any amount will be
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:50.640]  greatly appreciated from a third party candidate. If you can only send 20 dollars, believe me,
[1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:55.040]  we'll give you a pat on the back, shake your hand and thank you and a look right in the eye.
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:59.040]  Well, the mainstream media is even admitting the public is close to physical revolution.
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:03.840]  Police are saying they're getting ready for riots after the elections. There's open talk of
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:08.720]  martial law in Congress. Third parties are only going to get stronger and stronger. Independent
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:12.880]  parties are only going to get stronger and stronger. But if we have this loser attitude
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:17.200]  and decide that we can't take action, they're going to win. And Governor Ventura, while you were
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:23.520]  here, and then we're going to go to Senator Barkley, you eloquently spoke to the fact
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:28.000]  that what's killing us is that Americans have been voting like it's a horse race for the horse
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:33.120]  they think is going to win or, or, or, or, you know, kind of like these fans who get on the
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:38.560]  bandwagon for a football team. Once it's assured they're going to win instead of ideas. And then
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:42.800]  that allows the corporate controlled media to dominate and only show the two parties. Can you
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:48.800]  say that in your own words? Well, for me, it's vote your heart and conscience. It's as simple as
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:54.480]  that. Don't go into that election booth thinking, well, everyone's voting for so-and-so, so I want
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:59.920]  to be on the winning side. That's the wrong attitude to take. Go into that booth and pick
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:05.760]  out the person that you most want to do that job. And if you vote your heart and your conscience,
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:11.840]  you can walk out of that booth with your head held high knowing that you're a patriotic American
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:16.880]  and that you're doing what our forefathers had in mind to begin with. You know, let's remember
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:22.080]  something. They didn't have in mind career politicians way back in the day when they formed
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:26.880]  our country. They didn't believe people would go out and make a career of getting elected.
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:32.240]  They believed that you'd come from the private sector, you'd go serve and then imagine when
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:37.040]  you're done, go back to what you used to do or go on to a new career in the private sector
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:43.520]  is what I usually do. But again, this is an opportunity, Alex, for America, for all the
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:50.160]  angry people out there to strike out and send a message, send an independent senator to Washington.
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:52.960]  That'll shake them up more than anything they can imagine.
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:41:03.440]  www.SenatorBarkley.com. Barkley is B-A-R-K-L-E-Y. We're going to get links up later today
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:08.480]  up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. And I want to get one of our writers to do a story
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:15.360]  about this and this important campaign. How much attention have you been getting, Senator Barkley?
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:20.960]  I've been getting attention. It's unbelievable. I mean, it's been nonstop. I'm going all over
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.040]  the state of Minnesota. I just got a major endorsement from one of the major papers up at
[1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:30.320]  St. Cloud. I couldn't have written a better one. Like I say, everyone who hears me speak and talk
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:35.680]  about my vision of where this country needs to go and the problems we're facing and how bad things
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:41.680]  have gotten. And we just need to quit these bad habits. I mean, Ben Franklin said it very well
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:46.640]  when he said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:51.040]  a different result. This country's got to change its direction. And this could be the first step.
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:54.880]  I mean, you can have a revolution in this country by voting the right way. I mean,
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:59.600]  if you like what you got, well, fine. Pick the Democrat or Republican. But if you want someone
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:04.560]  who's going to change the direction this country is heading like Ron Paul wanted to do, here's
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:08.800]  your chance. This would be the first step. This wouldn't just be for Minnesota. This is for the
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:15.600]  entire country to say, hey, we've had it. Quit doing what you're doing and start solving these
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:19.840]  problems and quit fighting or you're going to lose your job. And I guarantee the only thing that
[1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:26.080]  Democrats and Republicans pay attention to is power. And until we start sending people to Washington
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:30.800]  that consider themselves to be Americans first and members of a political party second, nothing's
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:38.880]  going to ever change. So this could be the first step. Absolutely. Dean, I couldn't say it more
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:45.520]  eloquently myself. You're ready for the job. I give you my stamp of approval. No, I'm ready
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:49.440]  for it too. I mean, now we've got a lot of work to do in this country. We can do anything we want
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:53.920]  if we just set our mind to it. These problems can all be solved. It isn't the end of the world,
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:58.640]  but we've got to change the system that's destroying us. How much more are we going to
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:03.200]  take before we're going to wake up and start voting the right way? Well, I mean, it's good news
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:08.400]  that folks are upset. We're getting record voter turnout. And maybe it's a process of them fully
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:12.800]  waking up. So at first, they just disengaged from the system. Now they're coming back to it in
[1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:16.400]  droves and they're going to find out, like Ventura said, the governor, that it's a fraud,
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:20.480]  then they're going to come to the third parties, to the independence. That's already happening.
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:25.440]  And so this wave is only building now. And people have no excuse. They can't just sit there and
[1:43:25.440 --> 1:43:28.800]  suck their thumbs. No matter where you live in the United States, if you're a U.S. citizen,
[1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:35.600]  you can donate. I am going to go online today and I'm going to donate money to the Barclay campaign.
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.920]  And I think everybody out there should do it because, you know, this is a good shot we've
[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:43.520]  got here to have somebody with a bully pulpit, somebody who can be a swing vote, you know,
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:49.760]  an independent, even in the house is a big deal. And a lot of attention gets paid to them. In the
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:58.960]  Senate, this will be just a huge deal. And it's so important that people get involved right now
[1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:04.320]  because we've got, what, eight, nine days, this money will come in, this ad package being produced,
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:09.520]  done by tomorrow, ready to hit TV, you know, that punch right to the nose, like Jesse Ventura
[1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:17.760]  said, we need to get you elected, Senator Barclay. So again, 763-417-9972 is the number for the
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:23.600]  campaign office 763. Well, I've got some good news too. Our website is being swamped right now.
[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:29.200]  And so people can't get through or if we crash, we'll be back up. So don't, don't give up if
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:33.360]  you can't get through. Because right now my webmaster is telling me we're just being inundated
[1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:38.640]  now with support. And I thank you for doing it. Well, Alex, you're a damn, you're a man in your
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:43.760]  word because you told me that yesterday what would happen. Well, I know how great my listeners are.
[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:50.640]  No kidding. You've got, you're tapped right into your listeners and I'm so happy. I mean,
[1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:55.680]  this is outstanding. Well, you've got some true Americans out there and we can't take this country
[1:44:55.680 --> 1:45:01.120]  back, but we have to start. Well, folks, if the site does completely crash, we have millions of
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:09.760]  listeners. The key here is the phone numbers 763-417-9972. And Senator, I do hope you have
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:13.840]  quite a few people there to answer the phones because they'll get calls. I mean, different
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:18.000]  stations air this throughout the day and throughout the night and at some in the morning. So you're
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.320]  going to get calls for the next 24 hours. Right. We can take credit card information right over
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:26.240]  the phone and then do the donation that way so we can get it in time for the TV spots.
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:30.320]  Hey, listen, the reason I'm behind you is I've seen your stances, your policies,
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:34.560]  very close to Ron Paul, very close to what Ventura stood for as well. And I know you
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:38.640]  were a trailblazer. I know you've already been to the Senate as an appointment for a month.
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:42.240]  And so it's just right to send you there instead of the other guys. I mean, the other guys are
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:47.120]  total jokers. You know, one of them is a total establishment insider. Franken's basically a
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:51.760]  socialist who didn't even really live in Minnesota, been in New York, you know,
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:56.560]  doesn't even have a Minnesota driver's license till he got back. And, you know, you're there.
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:01.600]  You're there fighting. You helped get Ventura elected. You know, you've got, you've paid your
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:06.160]  dues, you know, you've made your bones in this fight. And regardless of whether you win, lose,
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:09.920]  or draw, we're taking action. We're not sitting on our butt. Look, when I asked Ventura,
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:13.920]  you know, when Willie invited, he said, Hey, I have Ventura down. You know, I mean, Ventura came,
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:18.160]  you know, he's a go getter taking action while he's shooting, you know, all these pilots for TV
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:22.400]  and all this other stuff. He came down here just because we asked him to come down here.
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:27.520]  And so that's why also, I mean, a lot of life is just taken action folks and not sitting there
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:31.680]  on your butt questioning a lot of people want to do it perfect. They want a silver bullet
[1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:36.240]  or they want to have some, you know, magic master plan given to them to fix things.
[1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:40.160]  A lot of it is just getting up off our butts and taking action with the Bill of Rights,
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:44.000]  the Constitution and just throwing ourselves against the machine. Governor Ventura.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:49.280]  Yes, Alex. I mean, can you speak to just taking action?
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:57.440]  Well, you know, it's a case of if, you know, if not you, then who? If you sit back and wait
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:03.120]  for everybody else to do it, nothing is going to happen. But if you step forward and it requires
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:09.760]  all of us in our own way, in our own small way, this is the greatest country in the world without
[1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:16.880]  a doubt. And it, but it may not be the direction that we're heading now. We are not going in the
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:21.600]  direction of being the greatest country in the world, but we don't need to let that happen.
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:27.680]  And it's all our choice. We can bitch, we can complain, we can do all of those things.
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:34.000]  But truthfully, you've got to be people of action. You've got to step forward, do what you can do.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:41.120]  I mean, if it's only $10, hey, if that's all you could afford to do to a campaign, that's enough.
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:46.480]  Or if you've got family in Minnesota, you're from Minnesota, call all your friends and family,
[1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:53.040]  get up off your butt, call 15, 20, 30 people and tell them vote for Senator Dean Barkley. Vote for
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:48:01.200]  Dean Barkley and tell them senator Barkley.com, www.SenatorBarkley.com. I mean, that is powerful.
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:05.360]  People in Minnesota, I know Ted's given to the campaign, the owner of Genesis based up there
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:11.040]  in Burnsville. That's what it's all about here. But you know, in the final equation,
[1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:16.800]  there is a sleeping giant that's rising and the people are beginning to resist.
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:23.280]  Senator Barkley, Ron Paul on this radio show has called for criminal indictments by
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:31.600]  grand jury at the state level of Paulson, of Fed Secretary, of the chairman of the Federal Reserve,
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:35.680]  Ben Bernanke. What would you do about this bailout and all the corruption we see
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:37.760]  if you were able to get into the Senate?
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:41.840]  Well, I think we're going to put an end to it. You know, I found out a simple fact a couple of
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:46.640]  days ago. Do you know that these same Wall Street banks that just got bailed out are projecting
[1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:52.480]  to spend over $70 billion in bonuses by the end of the year? I mean, what gives here? I mean,
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:56.880]  this is insanity. We should have an investigation. If I'm in the Senate, I'll try to get that in
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:01.920]  the clinic and investigate. Oh, what happened here? What really happened? Who was asleep at the
[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:06.560]  switch? I think there should be some heads to roll here. And my God, if you're running for
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:10.320]  reelection after you were in charge, all this happened, why in the world did you ever reelect
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:14.800]  someone? If they'd been on the board of directors, they'd be indicted right now. Not seeking
[1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:19.680]  reelection. I mean, it's incredible. It's just incredible the amount of mismanagement that we've
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:25.360]  seen the last 10 years in Congress. And it's time for people to, like I said, here's their chance.
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:30.640]  Send me there. I will make a ruckus. I promise you, I mean, I haven't taken one dime from Wall
[1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:35.440]  Street. You know, Norm Coleman, one of my opponents, has taken $3 million from the banking
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:40.400]  sector alone. And he's going to go back and fix this. Give me a break. What would you do about
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:45.760]  these? You know what else is interesting about him, too, Dean, our illustrious current senator?
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:51.520]  He's supposed to be a Republican, right? That stands for private business and all of that.
[1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:59.600]  This guy has been cashing government checks for 32 years. He's never worked with a private sector.
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:06.960]  He has not worked in the private sector in 32 years. It's time to move him in. It's time to
[1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:14.160]  him for him to live those ads he has on TV, where he tells all of us that he feels our pain. Well,
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:19.600]  how can he possibly feel our pain when he's cashing the government check for 32 straight years?
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:26.560]  Yeah, it's time to put him out to pasture. That's right. Unbelievable. Let's find out what a real
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:32.800]  job is like, where you might have to actually go out and earn a living, which all of us have to do.
[1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:37.760]  When we get back, we're going to ask Senator Dean Barkley. He was there for a month to point
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:42.880]  about Ventura. In a close race, he can win Senator Barkley.com. We're going to ask him
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:46.960]  what he would do on the Iraq war, what his plan for that is. The senator can do a lot,
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:51.520]  have a lot of press conferences, raise a lot of ruckus, a very, very powerful. We need to get
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:57.200]  him in there. That's why we're spending time on this today. Senator Barkley.com. Stay with us.

[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:07.920]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra,
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:14.000]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:22.160]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EVA director on the
[1:52:22.160 --> 1:52:28.960]  AT made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:34.240]  of 9-11 truth, as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:38.400]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off,
[1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:44.240]  and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency

[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:40.800]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. We are talking to former Governor Jesse Ventura also.
[1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:45.440]  He's in two of my favorite movies, Predator and the Running Man. I remember being a little kid, man,
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:51.120]  and liking Ventura more than, you know, Schwarzenegger on those shows. Just the character, man. He's
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:58.320]  great on screen. But then all the other things he's done, Navy Seal. He was even a rock star. He even
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:02.640]  got on the charts with one or, you know, in a big CD. And he's done so much in, of course,
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:06.560]  Governor of Minnesota. And we've got Senator Dean Barkley. I'm going to keep a few minutes
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:11.920]  into the next hour so he can actually, you know, go through his platform. He's anti-New World Order.
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:17.680]  He's anti-war. And we're going to talk about that. But just give us the brief take on it
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:22.800]  before we say bye to Ventura, Senator Barkley. On the Iraq War. I mean, it's the biggest mistake
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:28.080]  since Vietnam. We were lied to in Vietnam. We were lied to in this war. We've now spent five
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:34.240]  and a half years, over $600 billion that we don't have. And over 4,300 American lives have been
[1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:40.640]  lost. It's time to get out of that war. I won't vote for a single spending bill authorizing that
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:45.520]  war without a firm timetable. I think we can get out within six months. And we have to get out of
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:51.520]  it and let Iraq determine its own future now. What about the New World Order? Oh my God. I mean,
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:56.640]  you know, we spend more on our military budget right now than all the other military budgets
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:00.640]  combined in the world. You know, I'm still waiting for the peace dividend. 20 years ago,
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:05.840]  we ended the Cold War. It's insane what we're doing. $11 trillion in debt. And we want to be
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:11.040]  the world's policeman in this New World Order about world government and giving up our sovereignty.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:16.080]  You know, we've got to put a stop to this insanity. We're going to talk more about that with you,
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:19.280]  Senator, when I keep you for five more minutes or longer, be like on the other side. But in closing,
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:23.840]  we've got about three minutes left here in the shower. Governor Ventura, again, it was great
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:27.280]  having you down here in Austin. You're even more amazing when you get to spend a few days with
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:32.400]  the United States a little while. Your closing comments on Senator Mark Lee and what we're doing
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:38.320]  here. Well, again, Alex, thank you very much for giving us the time today. You're a patriot,
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:44.720]  also, in what you do, and a great American. And you're out there every day on the battle line,
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:49.680]  talking what you're talking, and you got to keep it up, because always remember, our First Amendment
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:54.320]  rights are always in jeopardy. They're always trying to shut people up, and they don't want
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:58.880]  people talking about things that make them uncomfortable, Alex. And you're a person that
[1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:03.920]  gets out there. You got courage. You talk about the stuff that makes them uncomfortable. So you
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:08.480]  keep up the good work, too. And I have all the faith in the world and your listeners. I think
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:12.880]  we're going to step forward. We're going to get Senator Barkley elected, and they're going to
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:19.600]  hear a shot heard around the world again, just like a 98. In fact, it could be, you know, I'm
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:24.400]  heading off to work on my surfing down in Mexico. That's the thing I'm trying to conquer next is
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:29.600]  the waves. And I'll tell you what, knowing that Dean Barkley is going to be in Washington,
[1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:35.600]  and I'll surf a lot better, and I'll enjoy those waves much more when I come back in the spring.
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:38.960]  Oh, my God. And while you're at it, you're helping GM redesign the Hummer.
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:45.440]  Well, I don't know about that. I can sure go down there and blow them up now and then.
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:48.800]  Now, you were telling the story about telling them how to make a better battery. That was a
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:54.720]  funny story in the car. All right, we'll go. Anyway, Alex, I'm going to run. Take
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:58:00.160]  Senator Barkley. Good luck. We'll keep pounding out there next Tuesday. We're going to send an
[1:58:00.160 --> 1:58:04.720]  independent to Washington and scare the hell out of them. Thank you, Jesse.
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:09.040]  You bet. Jesse, one last question. We're talking around the break. I'm exhausted today with three
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:14.320]  hours sleep. You were telling me that sometimes you don't even sleep. No, well, you know,
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:18.960]  remember when you go through Navy SEAL training, they keep you awake for a week so you get used to it.
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:24.400]  Yeah, I mean, you have so much energy this morning at 5.45 when I picked up you were like
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:28.960]  a jumping jack and me. I was like driving on the road, falling asleep. Governor, it was a great
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.960]  adventure having you down here and we love you. Take care. Thanks, Alex. Same to you and we'll
[1:58:32.960 --> 1:58:38.320]  see you in Dallas, hopefully. That's right. We'll talk about that later. A little secret. All right,
[1:58:38.320 --> 1:58:48.640]  we'll be right back with the senator. Stay with us. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:57.520]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:58:57.520 --> 1:59:02.640]  this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.640 --> 1:59:07.840]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:12.080]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:59:12.080 --> 1:59:16.880]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[1:59:16.880 --> 1:59:23.680]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:29.360]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:59:29.360 --> 1:59:33.600]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:39.360]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:20.480]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:28.560]  Alex Jones. The more I learn about this, Dean Barkley, the more I like it. Anti-New World
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:35.520]  Ant Order, Anti-Global Government. Get us out of the war day one. Try to arrest the bankers.
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:42.160]  In the bailout, banker takeover. And I got home last night like one. I went and googled.
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:45.360]  He might not have heard about him. Ted had told me, I ought to have him on last week.
[2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:48.880]  He recommended it. I just never got around to it. He told me how great he was and part of the,
[2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:54.480]  you know, at the Ron Paul Liberty meeting and everything. And I went and pulled up that he
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:01:00.160]  was, you know, the 34% around the side. He was talking about 37% on the side of the good chance.
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:03.200]  He's got a winning of People Take Action. I just wish I'd known about this months ago.
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:07.600]  But Ventura has been so busy shooting three different pilots that I haven't talked too
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.240]  much to. And there's so much going on to even focus on Minnesota politics. But that's national
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:15.520]  because it's a senator. So we're going to keep him with us for another 20 minutes. We're going
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:18.880]  to take your phone calls. And you know, I don't screen calls here. But specifically,
[2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:22.400]  when we have a special guest on a certain issue, you can only call in on that issue. And we do
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:26.880]  that about once a week or so, maybe every two weeks. Not very often. The point is, only for
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:30.400]  Senator Barkley, they could ask him about any of his policies or bring up any issues with that.
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:39.680]  1-800-2599-231-800-2599-231. He was a senator appointed by Governor Ventura when Wellstone died
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:43.040]  for a month. So that's why as the title senator, we want to send him there officially.
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:45.920]  Okay, we got about three minutes till we break in this quick segment. We're going to come back
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:51.280]  and take calls. Tell us about your platform, Senator Dean Barkley. Well, my platform is pretty
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:57.520]  simple. I'm a fiscal conservative. I think that our country is going down the tube, the $11 trillion
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:01.360]  dollar debt. How much more are we going to put in there? It's not our kids anymore. Now it's our
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:05.680]  grandchildren. We're going to settle with this atrocious step. We've got our economy now based
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:10.560]  upon the goodwill of China to buy our bonds. What would Thomas Jefferson think that our whole economy
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:16.640]  now is based on China buying bonds? I mean, the position that they put ourselves in is just incredible.
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:21.520]  I mean, I can't believe it. But I'm a social moderate. I believe the government should stay
[2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:25.600]  out of our personal life, too. You know, you have the right to be stupid. And as long as you're
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:29.680]  hurting anyone else, you know, leave us alone. Well, I guess I'm the true conservative on both
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:36.000]  the social issues and the spending issues. What would you call that kind of little L libertarian?
[2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:41.200]  Yeah, I'd say a little L libertarian. I score very well on the libertarian test.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:46.960]  We have a libertarian party here. I think that we have to do a little bit more than just build roads
[2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:51.840]  and defect our borders, but not much. I think we need a limited government. We need a smaller
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:57.280]  government. Our government is too large. And we know we're going to have to start having the debate
[2:02:57.280 --> 2:03:01.440]  of, you know, we're 11 trillion dollars in debt, folks. I mean, we have to start having the debate
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:06.320]  of what we can stop doing. That new things we're going to do for people. How are you on the second
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:11.680]  amendment? How are you on the second amendment of the ultimate guardian of all the others?
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:17.280]  And so your four Vermont style carry nationwide.
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:22.160]  I think people, I mean, thank God the Supreme Court said it's just not to protect their
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:28.160]  hunting rights. Everyone in this country has the right to carry arms. And yes, we have to make sure
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:33.280]  that convicted felons and mentally ill people do not get their hands on it, but beyond that,
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:37.680]  no, that's our right to have it. We can collect guns. We can have as many guns, not the type,
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:41.840]  but the government shouldn't say what kind of guns you can have. We have the right to carry
[2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:46.480]  arms. We do. And that was a right given to us. And we've got to protect that as strong as the
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:52.000]  first amendment. So you'd repeal a lot of the federal gun laws as a senator. You try that.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:04:00.720]  Yes. That's exciting. Continue. Where do you stand on, I mean, specifically on the war?
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:04.960]  What would your plan be to get us out of there? Well, one thing is that, you know,
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:09.280]  that Congress has the ability in that war by stop the funding. I mean, they're the ones that have
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:14.400]  to put the funding bills in. Like I said, I would not vote for one new spending authorization
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:20.320]  for Iraq without a firm type table for withdrawal. Now, everyone wants us out of Iraq. Even the Iraqi
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:25.280]  government wants us out. The only one dragging their feet is Bush. And it's time to sit down
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:30.080]  and say, okay, how much time does it really take to safely get our troops out of there?
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:35.120]  I think we could do it within six months to a year. The very most is to get our troops
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  out of that country. Never should have been there. We've done enough. I don't want to,
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:43.920]  I don't want to lose one more American soldier to that battle anymore. We've done our part.
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:48.560]  We've put that country back together. Now it's time for them to determine what they want for
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:52.240]  themselves. We believe in self-determination. But the bankers are making hundreds of billions
[2:04:52.240 --> 2:04:58.080]  a year in no bid weapons contracts and $15 million blue $5 tarps. We'll be right back with Senator
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:05.680]  Dean Bartley. Drinking a chlorophyll rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.

[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:19.360]  Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%

[2:08:02.640 --> 2:08:10.400]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Jason Burmas is going to be
[2:08:10.400 --> 2:08:17.120]  riding shotgun the last hour and 40 minutes selling a Castillo. Speaking of guns, former DEA
[2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:23.200]  junior witness government narcotics trafficking set him up on a gun charge as a school teacher
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:30.640]  and he was selling guns illegally for selling a friend a gun and then buying some guns from an
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:37.280]  informant who kept pushing them on him. It's like Ruby Bridge, what they did there. It's amazing
[2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:41.680]  that's coming up. I want to take your phone calls for Senator Dean Barclay. He was there
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:46.320]  appointed for a month when Senator Wellstone died. He's trying to go back there and it's
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:55.520]  senatorbarclay.com. Drugs. I mean the CIA six months ago, a plane crashed in Mexico with 3.3
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:02.400]  times. CIA aircraft. In fact, it was the well-known plane used to carry people for torture to
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:08.080]  black ops camps in Europe. What would you do with the phony war on drugs? The bigger it gets,
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:13.520]  the more drugs we have on the streets. Well, I said the war on drugs has been a miserable failure.
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:17.680]  It has never worked. Every time you make something illegally, just create a whole different
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:21.840]  class of criminals. We haven't learned anything from prohibition. We have to stop putting
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:26.480]  addicted people into jails and give them the treatment that they need. We need to
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:30.640]  legalize. We need to regulate and then we can tax them. Maybe that can help us balance our budget.
[2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:38.800]  Well, you know heroin cocaine and everything was sold at every major pharmacy in the nation.
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:43.200]  And there were people that were addicted to it, but I've seen all the different numbers from the
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:49.200]  time much lower, about a third of what it is today. And you know, if you dig around in the
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:54.080]  countryside or the city anywhere, you find all the old Lodinum bottles and things, which was opium,
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:59.200]  and some people did get on it. But you didn't have these feds sneaking around,
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:01.840]  looking in your windows, you didn't have them shipping in to make the profits.
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:05.760]  You didn't have the police being corrupted by it and only a third as many people would go.
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:09.760]  I mean, what was snake oil? It'll cure all your ails. You're depressed. Drink this cocaine.
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:13.360]  Drink this. I think Coca-Cola had cocaine in it at one point.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:18.080]  It did until the mid 30s. Yeah, it had a lot of cocaine in it. In fact, the secret ingredient
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:24.000]  coke, this is admitted, is denatured. It's like decaffeinated coffee. It's de-coconated cocaine.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:30.160]  And that's where they, quote, have their secret ingredient plant is in Colombia.
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:36.800]  And so, yeah. Well, we got to stop making people that make bad choices and get themselves addicted
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:41.600]  criminals. It doesn't make any sense. Our prisons are full of them, and it's because they're addicted.
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:46.400]  Let's treat the addiction and let's quit making criminals out of everybody. People are going to
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:51.280]  get addicted. They are going to make bad choices. We shouldn't have to have them resort to a life
[2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:55.840]  of crime in order to do it. It makes absolutely no sense. This war on drugs has never worked.
[2:10:55.840 --> 2:11:00.480]  Anyone living on the Texas border knows how bad it is down there. It's a war zone. And that's
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:07.600]  because we've made it illegal and we've made a lot of bad people very wealthy by making criminals
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:11.520]  out of this. And we've got to come to a grip and say, hey, this isn't working, folks. Let's try
[2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:16.160]  something else. Well, the war on drugs started back in the 30s and it officially kicked off in
[2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:22.400]  the 80s. And when you make something, you know, cost hundreds of times what it should, it creates
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:25.680]  larger criminal elements. The government is laundering the money. The banks are laundering
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:29.360]  money. That's why it's actually working very well for their aims. And that's why you got
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:34.160]  crackheads, carjacking people and robin folks, where they should be at treatment facilities.
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:37.680]  And the establishment knows that and they're totally intellectually bankrupt. They've been
[2:11:37.680 --> 2:11:41.680]  caught hundreds of times shipping in the drugs. And, you know, we've got to turn this around
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:47.360]  and we've got to stop it. What would you do? I've been advocating a position for 16 years.
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:53.680]  Ever since I got into politics in 1992. Ventura says you were instrumental in getting him to
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:11:58.800]  run. Tell us a little bit about your history with the governor of Ventura. Well, Jesse was the
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:04.400]  honorary chair of my 1996 run for U.S. Senate Minnesota. I was trying to get the independence
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:09.280]  party major party status, which means I had to run for the Senate and get 5% of the vote,
[2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:15.600]  which I did. But he walked my hometown Anandale Fourth of July parade in 1996. I noticed that
[2:12:15.600 --> 2:12:19.600]  everybody was cheering for him and ignoring me. And I turned to him and said, you know,
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:24.000]  the wrong guy's running. You're going to run next. Well, he laughed at me. But I worked on him for
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:28.640]  a year. I recruited him to run for governor. I ran his campaign and we shocked the world in 1998.
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:33.440]  So we showed that it could be done. And I'm right on track where we were 10 years ago.
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:39.040]  This campaign is almost exactly where Jesse's was, except that people are much more upset right
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:44.160]  now. And they have every right to be there. Just in their 401Ks disappear because of government.
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:49.680]  And I think the timing is right. This is going to happen again. And then I can, I can, I can,
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:12:54.480]  I can blaze the path and then they can run that two years from now. We can keep on doing that.
[2:12:54.480 --> 2:12:58.480]  Let's be clear. You're only 10 points behind. Same place Ventura was, but even more,
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:04.320]  but even more undecided than you had back in the 90s. And so
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.880]  decided, and there's going to be about 20% more border show up than they did for Ventura than
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:14.720]  98. He had a 60% they're predicting an 80% in Minnesota. So this thing is just completely
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:19.040]  up in the air. And if I can get this TV campaign funded, I'm going to win this thing.
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:23.280]  You know, I'll be shameless. I'll give you the plug for the website again. It's senator
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:27.920]  Barkley.com. Or if they want to call the office, our phones are busy right now. So keep trying.
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:32.480]  It's seven, six, three, four, one, seven, nine, nine, seven, two. And just do your, like Jesse
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:36.960]  said, whether it's just $5, it'll all add up. You know, there's a small price.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:41.840]  That's the point I wanted to make. Your competitors, the two establishment whores,
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:49.920]  that's what they are. They have raised 30 million. You have spent 50,000 and you're within 10 points
[2:13:49.920 --> 2:13:56.480]  of beating them. Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, this is the example of ideas over fluff and garbage.
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:02.880]  And if you want that gun grabber or you want that neocon in power, then, you know, don't get
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:07.440]  involved here. Let's go ahead and take some calls. Eric in Kansas, then Eric in Wisconsin,
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:12.800]  then others. Go ahead. You're on the air, Eric. Hey, Alex. This is Eric from the info wars money
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:18.960]  bomb. Senator Barkley. Yeah. I just wanted to chime in and tell all my fellow listeners,
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:23.760]  I'm from Minnesota. Out there in Minnesota, we've got a whole lot of Swedes and a whole lot of
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:31.440]  Norwegians. Yeah. So if you like the idea of sending an angry Viking up to the Senate, we've
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:38.000]  got back this guy. Thank you. They all keep talking as they say in Minnesota. Yeah, sure.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:41.920]  You bet. Is this, is this Eric Nordstrom that did the Ron Paul money bomb and then did mine?
[2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:47.840]  Oh, I wanted to talk to him more. Yeah. Well, we should have done a money bomb for you. You know,
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:51.200]  I mean, it was his idea and the people saying, you're having a money bomb, you're having a
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:54.880]  money bomb. And then suddenly all this money came in and we're using that for the new TV
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:15:00.720]  studio will soon give folks a tour of, but wow, we should have done a money bomb. I just really
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:04.880]  didn't know that much about you, Mr. Barkley. I wish I would have gotten involved earlier.
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:09.600]  Well, it's better late than never. We still have time. We still have eight days to go before the
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:14.400]  election. And I could say the next three days is when I need to raise the money. And if I can do
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:19.760]  it, like I said, Jesse, this will be a huge message. I don't think you can do it. Regardless,
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:24.160]  the TV ads are going to run. Just your political experts are telling you you need this extra amount
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:29.840]  to really be effective. Yeah, I think I do. I think I need, unfortunately, many, many Minnesotans
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:34.320]  get their messages from television. Television is expensive. I mean, I'm still going to be
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:39.920]  outspent 400 to one, but if I can get enough TV ads on the air, we've got the buys already
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:45.280]  scheduled to go out. We believe we'll get enough coverage that we will then close the deal on
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:50.720]  this race. But I'm right now about $30,000, $40,000 short, which is just a pittance compared
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.200]  to what they're doing. But if I can raise $30,000 to $40,000 in the next few days, I think this
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:15:59.120]  race can be won. I think it's going to happen here. We have the best audience in the world.
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:05.840]  Eric in Wisconsin. Eric, you're on the air. How's it going, Alex? Good. I called in before when
[2:16:06.800 --> 2:16:11.920]  Jesse Ventura was on the show, and you guys really got me motivated. I did some research,
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:16.240]  and we have a candidate here. I'm in Wisconsin, so I'm just over the river from you.
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:19.440]  All those cheese ads. That's okay. We love cheese ads, too.
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:28.160]  Well, you know what? When setting the football thing aside, Kevin Barrett's running for Congress
[2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:34.880]  over here, and I met him recently, and I'm helping him with his campaign. We did a video
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:40.400]  shoot on YouTube where Kevin Barrett actually gave Ron Kynes his pink slip, wearing a V for
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:49.440]  Vendetta mask. Well, good. Fire out the website then. His website is heavenbarrettforcongress.us.
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:54.800]  Okay. I'm going to jump. I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Matt in New York. You're on the
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:59.200]  air, Matt. Alex, you there? Yes, sir. Hey, Alex. Hey, Senator Barkley. It's Matt from
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:04.640]  MobilizeThePeople.com. Alex, I want to thank you for waking me up a few years back. You've
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:08.640]  definitely set the example on the bar pretty high. It's actually refreshing to hear from
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:14.000]  representatives like Senator Barkley on your show. Alex, Thomas Jefferson once prophetically
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:19.120]  said that every government degenerates when trusted to the rules of the people alone.
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:24.400]  The people themselves, therefore, it's only safe depositories. How do you guys, Senator Barkley,
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:30.880]  especially how do you feel about that? Well, I'm Jefferson with the wise men. Jefferson always
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:36.480]  said, he also said that having a revolution every generation would be good for a democracy.
[2:17:36.480 --> 2:17:40.800]  Yeah. I think the time is right for that. The three of liberty must be
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:46.240]  nourished from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. Yeah. I recently spoke
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:50.640]  with Chuck Schumer over here in New York, and I was asking him about the Federal Reserve,
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:56.240]  and to be quite honest, these incumbent politicians, they have absolutely no answers,
[2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:00.000]  no responses. Either they're clueless or they just don't want to acknowledge.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:04.080]  No, they act clueless. They're bought and paid for the New World Order. Got to jump, Matt.
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:11.120]  Wayne in Mississippi. Go ahead, you're on the air. Hello? Yes, sir. How you doing, sir? Good.
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:16.240]  Thanks for what you're doing, man. Well, I'm a rack vet, and I got a couple of questions to ask you.
[2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:21.680]  Okay, sir. Go ahead. All right, man. What are you going to plan to do about the VA system?
[2:18:22.560 --> 2:18:26.880]  And I want to, what are you going to do about clarifying the casualty report over there?
[2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:31.440]  Because what they flash on CNN ain't true. That's right. If you die out of country,
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:37.200]  they don't count it as a death, so it's really close to 18,000, not 5,000. Correct, sir? Yes, sir.
[2:18:38.800 --> 2:18:41.360]  Well, I absolutely want what we're going to do with our veterans. I mean,
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:45.840]  we're going to say that we have 700 foreign military bases. We have troops in Germany and
[2:18:45.840 --> 2:18:50.720]  Japan that we don't need. If we cut those costs, we like to have more than enough money to adequately
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:55.760]  care for those who have given their lives, and they've become wounded and coming back.
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:59.920]  We have an obligation to make sure our vets are taken care of. What about an investigation on the
[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:04.160]  casualty reports? Well, that's the first time I've heard that. I'm sorry, but I certainly would take
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:08.000]  a look at that. If they're underestimating or underreporting casualties, you know, it's just
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:11.840]  another one of the lies that led us into this, and we have to undercut for that. Well, it's not
[2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:17.600]  letting people photograph the coffins or the funerals. Yeah, they don't see you. If you die
[2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:23.440]  in Iraq, it counts. But if you die in Romstein, or you die back in the U.S., a month later,
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:27.360]  a week later, a day later, it doesn't count. Oh, they're just trying to sanitize war, aren't they?
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:33.200]  Yeah, you know, it's just incredible. I mean, no, if you got shot in Iraq, I, that's a
[2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:36.720]  pretty, no, I'll be honest. The first time I heard that, and then you're dying in a hospital
[2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:40.960]  outside of Iraq, that doesn't count. But do we know what the real death toll is?
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:45.920]  Yeah, it's around 18,000, according to sources, you know, major institutions. You know what,
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:49.440]  I know you've got a lot of other interviews coming up, but can we do five more minutes on
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:54.480]  the other side so we can finish up with these calls? Sure. Okay. Former Senator Dean Barkley,
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:58.720]  he was there appointed for a month. He's the guy that got Jesse Ventura into politics.
[2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:25.200]  He's a great guy. We need to get behind him.
[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:51.200]  We need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to
[2:20:51.200 --> 2:21:17.200]  get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind
[2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:43.200]  him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:21:43.200 --> 2:22:09.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to
[2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:35.200]  get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:23:01.200]  him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:23:01.200 --> 2:23:27.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:53.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:23:53.200 --> 2:24:19.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:24:19.200 --> 2:24:45.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:25:11.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:37.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:26:03.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:29.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:55.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:27:21.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:47.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:28:13.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:39.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:29:05.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:31.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:57.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:29:57.200 --> 2:30:23.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:30:23.200 --> 2:30:49.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:30:49.200 --> 2:31:15.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:31:15.200 --> 2:31:41.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:31:41.200 --> 2:32:07.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:33.200]  we need to get behind him,
[2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:59.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:32:59.200 --> 2:33:25.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:33:25.200 --> 2:33:51.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:33:51.200 --> 2:34:17.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:43.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:34:43.200 --> 2:35:09.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
[2:35:09.200 --> 2:35:35.200]  we need to get behind him, we need to get behind him,
