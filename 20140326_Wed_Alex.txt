[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:24.920]  Texas Alex Jones that's right cheerleaders your doctor and big brother
[00:24.920 --> 00:29.560]  we'll punch it up on screen here you can see what the drug reps are out there
[00:29.560 --> 00:34.760]  doing that's right ladies and gentlemen big karma infiltrating at every level
[00:34.760 --> 00:41.000]  paying out the cash bonuses the trips and more and I say that's about what the
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.440]  drug rep I saw look like and people are watching on screen and she was wearing a
[00:44.440 --> 00:48.280]  short skirt whole nine yards not quite that outfit but it was extremely
[00:48.280 --> 00:51.920]  leading and obvious what was going on and I was reminded wait I've read about
[00:51.920 --> 00:55.160]  this before but then when you come face to face with it it's crazy
[00:55.160 --> 00:57.800]  Weldon Henson's gonna come in here and overdrive and talk about what
[00:57.800 --> 01:01.080]  Loyal Silver did for him but you've been developing this already for years you
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.880]  let us private label it in fours life comm tell us how you use and what the
[01:06.880 --> 01:12.440]  lung shield does more healthy lung function I mean obviously you know like
[01:12.440 --> 01:15.640]  we talked about we don't have that but here's how you use it what you do is you
[01:15.640 --> 01:19.240]  take it's in a spray bottle which Nant which puts it in an aerosol just like
[01:19.240 --> 01:22.600]  they're doing in the in the chemtrails but this way you'll be able to absorb it
[01:22.600 --> 01:27.120]  really good and for adults what I use is six sprays just like this and then take
[01:27.120 --> 01:30.400]  three quick breaths like this
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.400]  and so you get some through your in my mouth and then other restaurants it's
[01:38.400 --> 01:42.600]  completely safe to use I've been using it for you so soothing when I had that
[01:42.600 --> 01:45.840]  chest cold and we had the stuff before came out oh it's great soothing on the
[01:45.840 --> 01:49.520]  throat is soothing in the lungs and it you know there's other things that you
[01:49.520 --> 01:52.640]  could do you don't really throw out lungs yeah you want to support your lung
[01:52.640 --> 01:55.600]  strong horse it is strong you know that's gonna be the peppermint in the
[01:55.600 --> 01:58.960]  menthol which actually breathe I didn't even know but athletes are actually
[01:58.960 --> 02:02.320]  using it now and they're saying because it opens up everything in the bronchi
[02:02.320 --> 02:05.320]  isn't they're getting better times and they're you know when they're working
[02:05.320 --> 02:09.600]  out athletes are working out that are using it but we all need the bottom line
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.240]  is we all need lung support and one of the reasons I'm working you know closely
[02:13.240 --> 02:18.000]  with you Alex is because we need to get this information out there and by
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.560]  people supporting and actually purchasing good products through your
[02:21.560 --> 02:24.960]  through info wars life I mean that supports the organization I mean that
[02:24.960 --> 02:28.360]  gives you the the ability to get this information out the more people it's my
[02:28.360 --> 02:34.120]  dream to to I see every single day the sickness of people that people have the
[02:34.120 --> 02:38.480]  contamination and the toxins that are being put in the food supply and sprayed
[02:38.480 --> 02:44.920]  in the air and and being put upon people and to cause disease so you need to be
[02:44.920 --> 02:48.000]  able to support your lungs and this is a good way to do it now other ways that
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.120]  you can do in your house put some plants in your rooms at your house that's
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.560]  going to increase the oxygen levels get rid of all the chemicals that you have
[02:54.560 --> 02:59.000]  inside your house that you're breathing in all the time you know stop smoking
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.560]  look at it look at the ingredients on everything that you know if you paint
[03:02.560 --> 03:06.640]  your walls make sure you use VOC free paint look check your house for mold and
[03:06.640 --> 03:10.680]  mildew it's about taking away the things don't go outside on the days or wear a
[03:10.680 --> 03:14.480]  mask when you go outside on the chemtrail days you know do some things
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.120]  also to avoid taking those toxins and breathing those toxins in on a regular
[03:20.120 --> 03:25.040]  basis but I personally and my kids have bottles of this next to their bed and
[03:25.040 --> 03:28.000]  they use it because they're exposed to all kinds of things all the kids are in
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.080]  school these days are sick and they're all coughing and everything else because
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.040]  their immune system so shut down because they were vaccinated but you have to it's
[03:36.040 --> 03:42.040]  not if or when you are being attacked with your respiratory systems I mean I
[03:42.040 --> 03:46.600]  agree folks and your purchase supports the broadcast lung cleanse info wars

[03:59.320 --> 04:02.520]  was kind of his idea and Anthony's to try out he said I probably not gonna
[04:02.520 --> 04:05.360]  endorse and I'm sure I'll do something to come on it's it's herbs some real
[04:05.360 --> 04:08.480]  vitality you know he was already a power lifter he came back three players so

[04:20.800 --> 04:26.480]  mean Shane literally is freaking out behind the scenes he literally wasn't a
[04:26.480 --> 04:29.400]  depressed person before but he was kind of down during the winter and stuff and
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.240]  he just literally now he does take a lot more than what you're supposed to but
[04:33.240 --> 04:38.160]  the point is it's real and and I mean herbs are powerful folks and with all
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.400]  the estrogens and things out there these aren't fake steroids these just allow
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.720]  your body to release the hormones they need and block the estrogen mimicry so
[04:46.720 --> 04:49.440]  first he got really big on it then he wanted to rip up with it which you
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.120]  never been able to do he did that see the video and info wars calm video

[08:12.240 --> 08:16.000]  also begs for money every week every few weeks I'll have a guest in where it's
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.720]  interesting info but we also interspersed products we're selling that we believe
[08:19.720 --> 08:26.120]  are really high quality and help people and that's how we fund our operation
[08:26.120 --> 08:30.400]  through free association you check it out you buy it you test it if you like

[08:38.400 --> 08:44.040]  system water filters we sell or whether it's all these products months ago when
[08:44.040 --> 08:51.280]  we had the testers and the lung cleanse was in testing Weldon got the tester
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.120]  bottles because he's over the shopping cart and all that Weldon Henson Air Force
[08:54.120 --> 08:58.560]  veteran friend of mine country music singer here very successful we don't
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.480]  get too successful and leave us the point is is that but the broken spoke last
[09:03.480 --> 09:07.680]  night which I could have come out the point is is that he just separately said
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.320]  you know this lung cleanse got me through the allergies like nothing before this
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.480]  year this stuff's real see it's the testimonials of our own people folks and
[09:15.480 --> 09:18.720]  the testimony you've heard from listeners about the nascent iodine is
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.320]  proprietary or the supermell vitality or the fluoride shield this is real stuff
[09:23.320 --> 09:29.760]  we've now got six products out in infowarslife.com so the lung cleanse is
[09:29.760 --> 09:33.400]  here but Weldon I wanted you well first I guess since you brought that up tell
[09:33.400 --> 09:36.680]  us about the lung cleanse what it did for you it just won the shopping cart
[09:36.680 --> 09:39.480]  today but you were using it months ago when we were approving it and everything
[09:39.480 --> 09:43.360]  and it was an unlabeled bottles and then give us your take on the colloidal
[09:43.360 --> 09:46.600]  silver because I was doing a gestalt of the story you told me the other day I
[09:46.600 --> 09:49.960]  didn't get it all entirely right about how you went into the VA and the
[09:49.960 --> 09:53.080]  antibiotics weren't helping and then what you did and what works so tell that
[09:53.080 --> 09:56.840]  story well first off you know when we were first thinking about doing the lung
[09:56.840 --> 10:01.440]  cleanse doctor group sent us some test bottles and then he said you know I told
[10:01.440 --> 10:04.600]  him about how the Cedar gets me over here in Austin he said well you know you
[10:04.600 --> 10:09.760]  can use it as that you know Fran and histamine as well so we did that and after
[10:09.760 --> 10:12.540]  five years of dealing with Cedar allergies that got me through it every day
[10:12.540 --> 10:18.000]  you know just take five or six sprays worked fine how much did it help you well
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.920]  I could breathe through my nose that was those phenomenal I mean you said it
[10:21.920 --> 10:26.960]  could help helps you get through it I mean was it a 20% better 50% better well
[10:26.960 --> 10:30.800]  it was just a matter of you know usually during January with the Cedar allergies
[10:30.800 --> 10:34.280]  I can't breathe through my nose at all and can't sleep and I just I would say
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.720]  80% better it was just as a routine daily thing to use something good going in
[10:39.720 --> 10:44.360]  your lungs rather than that wicked Cedar yeah amazing now tell us about the
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.920]  strep in your lungs that has killed members of my family you name it running
[10:48.920 --> 10:53.960]  rampant across Texas and the rest of the country and and the VA all of it what
[10:53.960 --> 10:58.000]  did the silver do tell that story well yeah I mean I didn't even tell Alex this
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.880]  story he actually walked in when me and Anthony were talking about it you know I
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.360]  had come down with the little strep throat you know so I went to the VA and
[11:06.360 --> 11:10.640]  that's a antibiotics and that took forever by the way and just to get some
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.800]  antibiotics from them so I just started taking the cloto silver we hadn't even
[11:14.800 --> 11:17.800]  had it for sale yet we did you know we had it all ready to go and I was just
[11:17.800 --> 11:21.160]  like you know what Anthony was like man this will really help you out so I drank
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.840]  a bottle of it over about a day and a half maybe two days I was wrong it was a
[11:24.840 --> 11:29.440]  bottle yeah I drank a bottle well it was getting real bad you know I was just
[11:29.440 --> 11:32.320]  you know you know how it is when the when the strep throat's first hitting you
[11:32.320 --> 11:35.520]  know the bacteria you just can't swallow and your throat just literally feels
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.160]  like it's they're eating you yeah oh yeah absolutely so I was just like man
[11:40.160 --> 11:42.680]  you know these antibiotics aren't working and the VA you know there's not
[11:42.680 --> 11:46.720]  really helping me and Anthony was like you just just drink some of this cloto
[11:46.720 --> 11:49.560]  silver I was like alright I'll give it a go because you were telling me you went
[11:49.560 --> 11:52.560]  in first and stuff they gave you didn't work then then you were waiting to get
[11:52.560 --> 11:55.600]  another appointment it was seven days you were saying so that so you were off
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.480]  antibiotics hadn't worked the silver knocked it out absolutely what did the
[11:59.480 --> 12:04.200]  silver do I mean what did it feel like well and just because I felt the
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.240]  antibiotics when they've worked before yeah where where you can actually like
[12:07.240 --> 12:11.760]  seven hours in feel it start going away but it burns worse at first did it do
[12:11.760 --> 12:15.360]  like that or was it different than antibiotics no it was actually a little
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.600]  different I mean I drank half the bottle the first day and I would say within a
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.440]  couple hours all of a sudden I could I didn't have those symptoms as bad I mean
[12:23.440 --> 12:26.960]  the symptoms were barely there that I had the strep throat barely and then by the
[12:26.960 --> 12:30.400]  time I woke up the next day it did I mean I was still a little drained of
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.160]  energy you know because when you get strep throat I mean you feel bad but I
[12:34.160 --> 12:42.160]  mean I felt felt felt good Dr. Group what does silver do well silver is just a
[12:42.160 --> 12:46.200]  it's just a potent antimicrobial what it does is it just bonds on this on the
[12:46.200 --> 12:51.560]  certain receptor sites and kind of swallows out and it works on the
[12:51.560 --> 12:56.360]  respiratory system of the viruses and the bacteria and everything so basically
[12:56.360 --> 13:00.200]  they can't breathe they just go into as asphyxiation and they can't take any
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.400]  nutrients in and they can't they just can't survive so just completely shuts
[13:04.400 --> 13:09.480]  them down that's what it does and so they die and this is layman turns but I've
[13:09.480 --> 13:12.600]  heard the smaller it is the better because you go right through their their
[13:12.600 --> 13:16.880]  cell wall and really kill them yes back to have a cell wall cell membrane you
[13:16.880 --> 13:20.240]  know every colloidal silver product out there is usually a certain type of
[13:20.240 --> 13:24.880]  nanometer size or in the atomic level it just depends on you know you might if
[13:24.880 --> 13:28.680]  you can come in if you can come in contact with a bacteria or a fungus or
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.200]  something like that directly with the silver it's not that important on the
[13:32.200 --> 13:38.640]  size of course you do want a colloidal size but you know there are certain
[13:38.640 --> 13:42.600]  ways which you can even enhance the colloidal silver by by even mixing a
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.800]  tiny bit of 3% food grade hydrogen I mean 3% hydrogen peroxide that's
[13:46.800 --> 13:51.120]  distilled water and that'll even cause the silver to become a smaller particle
[13:51.120 --> 13:55.040]  size why are they backing off harassing colloidal silver is because I go to
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.680]  Walgreens or CVS and there's all these silver products now the hospitals are
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.640]  using it I mean I guess we're starting to win with the fact hey the antibiotics
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.240]  ain't working you know we need something different here yeah that I don't care the
[14:07.240 --> 14:10.240]  antibiotics work I'll take those but that's why it's a good investment to
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.040]  stock up on physical silver because actually we are running out of so the
[14:14.040 --> 14:20.240]  actual physical silver supply it is being it is being accepted by the medical
[14:20.240 --> 14:23.480]  community more there's more studies that have come out on it and the
[14:23.480 --> 14:26.760]  pharmaceutical companies jumped on it with all the band-aids with that silver
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.120]  there's silver in clothing now there's still there's more the silver and main
[14:31.120 --> 14:35.640]  line water filters the whole hospital system is taking it on now and the in
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.200]  American Medical Association is endorsing it and it's being taught to
[14:39.200 --> 14:44.560]  doctors so now it's not as conspiracy I was about to say when I was in the
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.080]  hospital with my uncle I was looking at the new gauze and the band-aids and
[14:49.080 --> 14:53.040]  things you know in the containers and it had you know the names of such and such
[14:53.040 --> 14:58.280]  silver so I guess it's we're winning yeah they we won I mean it's you know
[14:58.280 --> 15:01.440]  that's why they're not coming down on it is hard right now for people like us
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.000]  that are selling it because it's already in the mainstream and the
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.840]  pharmaceutical companies are making money off of it now so you know they saw
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.480]  it was good they knew they could make a lot of money on it and you're seeing
[15:10.480 --> 15:13.280]  that not only with silver but the pharmaceutical companies are buying up
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.120]  all the the herbal manufacturing companies right now they know that we're
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.000]  making a transition into more natural medicine and they're buying up all the
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.520]  the big companies we get offers for our company you know seven times over gross
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.800]  income five times over gross income a year from all these these people on
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.280]  Wall Street that are represented these brokers that are the representatives for
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.800]  pharmaceutical companies they know it's a big money making well look at how they
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.160]  come out with their own prescription fish oil is three times more right their
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.920]  own prescription vitamin C they just don't want the competition no I mean the
[15:46.920 --> 15:49.520]  thing that the mistake that they're making though is they're coming out with
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.000]  synthetic vitamins they're coming out there they're trying to synthesize
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.320]  vitamins in the lab and and and it's actually causing more illness which they
[15:57.320 --> 16:00.960]  don't care because then they'll give you prescription medications like vitamin
[16:00.960 --> 16:06.240]  E, DL, alpha-tocopherol, succinate or you know the synthetic forms of the B
[16:06.240 --> 16:09.320]  vitamin and then they'll have studies about how vitamins don't help but the
[16:09.320 --> 16:13.000]  study is the synthetic I always notice that exactly that's exactly my dad sees
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.640]  those like in you know the reader's digest he goes look son it's the
[16:16.640 --> 16:20.720]  synthetic and then they'll pull up a study showing me the raw that's getting
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.600]  off the chart great right I mean did they still sell and promote the
[16:24.600 --> 16:28.600]  synthetic brand and they know that still 80% of the vitamins that are bought
[16:28.600 --> 16:35.840]  probably even more than that are bought through drug stores, wholesale stores,
[16:35.840 --> 16:40.080]  grocery stores that means that like 80-90% of the people out there they're
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.640]  buying Flintstone vitamins and all these crappy you know over the you know these
[16:44.640 --> 16:48.400]  drugstore vitamins and everything most of those are made by the
[16:48.400 --> 16:52.320]  pharmaceutical companies. Well look listen if their drugs will work I'm all
[16:52.320 --> 16:58.120]  for them my issue is if the antibiotics are starting to not work they better come
[16:58.120 --> 17:01.640]  up with something else and the question is will the germs get immune to silver?
[17:01.640 --> 17:06.840]  The germs will not as far as I don't know if they if they've bioengineered
[17:06.840 --> 17:09.600]  something I mean I wouldn't put it past them you know with everything that
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.200]  they're doing but as of today I don't think that there's any bugs that are
[17:14.200 --> 17:17.880]  resistant to silver and especially I don't think they'll ever be resistant to
[17:17.880 --> 17:21.520]  anasein iodine you know years ago when they didn't weren't even using silver a
[17:21.520 --> 17:27.160]  lot they would just give people about a hundred milligrams of anasein iodine or
[17:27.160 --> 17:30.760]  an iodine supplement and that would completely wipe out any type of germs
[17:30.760 --> 17:33.760]  or infections well everybody knew that like for so you wouldn't get blood
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.000]  poisoning though as they put iodine on the top of it in fact here is my
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.280]  survival shield nasin iodine which is its own type that we have it so popular
[17:44.280 --> 17:47.600]  that helps find the operation and I'm just so glad people have used this and
[17:47.600 --> 17:52.280]  they've enjoyed it we've had such rave reviews because everything Dr. Grips help
[17:52.280 --> 17:58.480]  develop a hmm has just done wonders when I still am overweight and I was healthy
[17:58.480 --> 18:02.120]  as I used to be because I've just been treating myself like crud for years but
[18:02.120 --> 18:07.400]  everybody in person but also someone on TV and see the physical difference that
[18:07.400 --> 18:11.320]  I look a lot younger and I feel a lot better and I have to get less sleep now
[18:11.320 --> 18:15.760]  everything look I mean you can go online and just look at a multitude of
[18:15.760 --> 18:18.960]  different nutraceutical products that are out there and there's going to be one
[18:18.960 --> 18:22.440]  big difference between the standard nutraceuticals or the crappy stuff you
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.320]  get at drugstores and the stuff that you're selling you look at the product
[18:26.320 --> 18:30.000]  reviews you can't hide stuff online anymore people are going to write about
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.240]  it they're going to write about your customer service all we've gotten is
[18:33.240 --> 18:37.360]  positive reviews I've never heard of that quickly that is unheard of in the
[18:37.360 --> 18:41.760]  nutraceutical industry unheard of and these this is stuff that actually works
[18:41.760 --> 18:45.200]  this is stuff that you get because we don't suppose the positive reviews half
[18:45.200 --> 18:49.520]  of them because those people write in making medical claims and the FDA and
[18:49.520 --> 18:52.520]  the government doesn't want people to find out I mean here's the deal here
[18:52.520 --> 18:57.200]  those all the time Alex of course we do the year I'm on the air you know here's
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.600]  the difference say with supermail vitality or with the fluoride shield or
[19:01.600 --> 19:08.000]  with a survival shield we go and get the most expensive best process strongest
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.480]  concentrate we want to be the crème de la crème we want to be the Ferrari of
[19:14.480 --> 19:19.760]  supplements but at a low price the Ferrari for the price of a Ford that's
[19:19.760 --> 19:24.440]  my goal and that's why Dr. Group and and my dad working with us now it all
[19:24.440 --> 19:27.800]  just merges and then again Weldon's running around with rave reviews I mean
[19:27.800 --> 19:31.320]  I remember him telling me you got to get this stuff you gotta put this out you
[19:31.320 --> 19:35.040]  got to get group to let you put it out this this lung cleanse months ago you
[19:35.040 --> 19:37.800]  were ranting at me about how good it was and I just kind of ignored you because

[23:04.800 --> 23:08.800]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[23:08.800 --> 23:12.280]  the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out
[23:12.280 --> 23:16.600]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for

[24:07.760 --> 24:13.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[24:13.120 --> 24:22.960]  oh that music is so beautiful and as we wind on down the road our shadows are
[24:22.960 --> 24:32.120]  taller than our souls that's poetry right there I can't help but just crank it
[24:32.120 --> 24:48.040]  up and as we wind on down the road our shadows taller than our souls
[24:48.040 --> 24:55.440]  oh you know this is real folks this isn't a fake radio show and let me tell
[24:55.440 --> 24:59.760]  you most of them are fake this is real I really believe the globalists are
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.880]  thinking about setting off nicks inside the United States and I've been telling
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.480]  that for a long time to bring in martial law
[25:10.400 --> 25:18.480]  our shadows there was a lady
[25:18.480 --> 25:34.760]  I mean what do we do what do we do as a society as a civilization as things just
[25:34.760 --> 25:41.160]  degenerate that's a big question and you know covering this news every day does
[25:41.160 --> 25:48.400]  get to me because of the seriousness of the entire situation and how delusional
[25:48.400 --> 25:52.920]  and mentally ill the general public is getting I'm seeing phenomenons that are
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.600]  just incredible where people are can breaking down completely and going off
[25:57.600 --> 26:06.760]  into their own fantasy lands now and not even aware of what's going on in their
[26:06.760 --> 26:12.120]  own lives they just believe everything's alright or they believe
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.120]  because their control freaks that that gives them power over everybody or they
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.160]  believe it's okay to shoot a homeless man a bunch of times in the back and then
[26:20.160 --> 26:23.840]  say that it's okay because they said they're okay and no grand jury dare
[26:23.840 --> 26:29.400]  indict God government and they just say it's okay to throw nuclear reactors in
[26:29.400 --> 26:32.880]  the ocean I mean we told you that radiation levels all over the west
[26:32.880 --> 26:36.440]  coast are on average at least double what they should be according to background
[26:36.440 --> 26:41.320]  radiation and in some areas 14 times higher and we went out with our
[26:41.320 --> 26:46.040]  reporters and made dinosaur media cover at the San Francisco Chronicle the
[26:46.040 --> 26:55.520]  Sacramento be the other publication San Jose Mercury news here it is today this
[26:55.520 --> 27:01.880]  is out of Reuters US Navy to test homes for radiation on San Francisco Island
[27:01.880 --> 27:06.480]  US Navy plans to test hundreds of homes for radiation in a remote San Francisco
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.440]  neighborhood after an object containing radium was found beneath an unoccupied
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.720]  residence in the area last fall city officials said Tuesday that is not what's
[27:17.720 --> 27:21.400]  causing radiation and to be up all over the area by the way folks in the coming
[27:21.400 --> 27:26.280]  weeks Navy officials not servants will begin surveying about 600 homes on
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.800]  Treasure Island a man-made landmass in San Francisco Bay that once served as a
[27:30.800 --> 27:36.720]  naval base said Bob Beck director with the city's Treasure Island Development
[27:36.720 --> 27:42.760]  Authority a full plan for the survey is still being developed but officials will
[27:42.760 --> 27:47.840]  likely use handheld scanning devices on the ground floors of homes to detect
[27:47.840 --> 27:52.240]  possible radioactivity underneath them in the event of a radiological survey of a
[27:52.240 --> 27:56.920]  housing unit reveals health concern the Navy will take immediate action plans to
[27:56.920 --> 28:02.080]  protect the residents yes so what do we do everybody's asking about radiation
[28:02.080 --> 28:05.680]  being up all over the coast line of San Francisco what do we do well we just go
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.080]  find one hot spot make it all about that that's what went on the board meeting I'd
[28:10.080 --> 28:18.240]  say 98% chance that's a standard deal standard sigh up continuing but we are
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.240]  forcing him to cover it and I guess that's what matters here it is a NASA
[28:21.240 --> 28:26.040]  funded study industrial civilization headed for irreversible collapse and
[28:26.040 --> 28:32.520]  there is another report out on that today NASA doesn't think the world is
[28:32.520 --> 28:36.480]  ending and journalists should stop implying that says international
[28:36.480 --> 28:40.320]  business times and they try to spin back the article well NASA in the British
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.600]  Ministry of Defense and the Defense Department say they believe there will
[28:43.600 --> 28:48.840]  be a massive reduction in standard of living and that quote we are unsustainable
[28:48.840 --> 28:52.360]  and and the industrial civilizations we know will collapse I don't know from
[28:52.360 --> 28:55.720]  looking at all the numbers if that's completely accurate but it does lean that
[28:55.720 --> 29:01.200]  way especially when agenda 21 is modeling the world under UNESCO as the
[29:01.200 --> 29:06.640]  global treaty to implode economies to make the population poor to live off
[29:06.640 --> 29:11.280]  government handouts produced by the largest of factory farming and factory
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.320]  production of bobbles which are then sold as the signants of success and
[29:15.320 --> 29:20.200]  societal wealth not actual property and family and not being in debt they're
[29:20.200 --> 29:23.920]  getting rid of all the old symbols of true independence and replacing them with
[29:23.920 --> 29:31.240]  well I'm part of a group I'm that's my value or I'm part of a you know a club
[29:31.240 --> 29:37.280]  or or or I'm a trendy or or I get government handouts I'm part of that
[29:37.280 --> 29:41.680]  group they're taking all the real rights and replacing them with foe rights that
[29:41.680 --> 29:46.800]  the trendies grovel like sycophantic baby birds as the poison is vomited in
[29:46.800 --> 29:52.720]  their filthy mouths we ride back we're on the march the empires on the run Alex
[29:52.720 --> 29:56.920]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.320 --> 30:03.320]  why does the United States in the largest percentage of GDP in the world on
[30:03.320 --> 30:07.480]  healthcare why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest

[33:39.120 --> 33:54.160]  I'm a fire starter and that's my goal we have to want to get people out of their
[33:54.160 --> 34:01.160]  doldrum out of their trance to realize that we're under attack and of all my
[34:01.160 --> 34:05.200]  foibles the reason we've been successful as I do my research I know what I'm
[34:05.200 --> 34:10.040]  talking about the final equation and I'm real and I'm passionate and I'm here to
[34:10.040 --> 34:16.880]  wake people up you can say what you want about our 19 years on air 17 plus
[34:16.880 --> 34:22.480]  syndicated and if you talk to somebody about the neural order out there on
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.200]  average they will say Alex Jones is the person that woke me up or got me
[34:27.200 --> 34:31.960]  thinking even most of my detractors say that and I would just say judge a tree
[34:31.960 --> 34:37.120]  by its fruits what have we done in the balance of our work it's wake people up
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.080]  and sometimes it's a train wreck ladies and gentlemen but sometimes it takes a
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.880]  train wreck to get people out of their comas and the brainwaves are lowering
[34:45.880 --> 34:51.400]  the IQs are lowering people on average are in a highly suggestible near
[34:51.400 --> 34:57.600]  trance state medically on record look it up look it up just type in brainwaves
[34:57.600 --> 35:03.360]  lowering television makes people more suggestible you'll get BBC you'll get
[35:03.360 --> 35:08.680]  MIT you'll get University of Texas DARPA psychology department funded
[35:08.680 --> 35:16.440]  programs the system knows this because they're the authors of it and if you
[35:16.440 --> 35:19.400]  ever seen children watching television after a few minutes they're drooling
[35:19.400 --> 35:22.760]  their mouths are open you're sitting there talking to them going honey honey
[35:22.760 --> 35:27.040]  honey it's lunch it's lunch and like you look at your wife and you go we better
[35:27.040 --> 35:32.320]  not let them watch television but then you still want to take them to a movie
[35:32.320 --> 35:37.920]  you still want to let them watch the Olympics or whatever and then there's
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.960]  all the social engineering during the commercials it's a mind fog and the mind
[35:43.960 --> 35:49.720]  fog is increasing and so I can't get mad at people it's just extremely
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.160]  frustrating ladies and gentlemen to be crazed for liberty and to be totally
[35:55.160 --> 35:59.320]  freaked out and I want people's prayers for America for the world and for
[35:59.320 --> 36:03.240]  sanity and and and for myself to have sanity because even in my private life
[36:03.240 --> 36:07.160]  over the years I don't use a lot of profanity I have a large vocabulary and
[36:07.160 --> 36:11.240]  don't need to but I've caught myself in private being more profane I've caught
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.920]  myself on air with mild stuff on air I should be more gentlemanly to control
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.200]  myself to not let because we've all got to hold it together folks I mean the
[36:20.200 --> 36:27.520]  missing nuke story is real and you saw them then start firing the entire upper
[36:27.520 --> 36:32.840]  brass over the nukes and large swaths of the mid and low level right down to
[36:32.840 --> 36:37.680]  launch officers and then announcing you know nukes are gonna hit the the east
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.320]  coast right where we said they went I mean that's scary folks I woke up at
[36:42.320 --> 36:47.480]  about four in the morning last night in the dark with the French Bulldogs
[36:47.480 --> 36:52.320]  nungled up next to me captain and I literally got up and went in the
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.960]  kitchen and got a glass of filtered water and I just sat there in the dark
[36:56.960 --> 37:04.040]  leaning over the kitchen sink going oh my heavenly father this is all real it's
[37:04.040 --> 37:11.680]  all real my wildest analysis my gut analysis of this all along has been
[37:11.680 --> 37:18.840]  right on and I am exposing people that are smuggling nukes out of Dias Air
[37:18.840 --> 37:23.240]  Force Base I'm exposing people that run child kidnapping rings worldwide they
[37:23.240 --> 37:31.100]  they launder 500 billion a year in drug money in the US publicly in the big six
[37:31.100 --> 37:36.240]  banks and no one gets in trouble they own the Congress they own most of police
[37:36.240 --> 37:40.600]  they own the FBI and the Justice Department the Justice Department got
[37:40.600 --> 37:44.400]  caught shipping guns in the Mexico the false flag the Second Amendment the
[37:44.400 --> 37:49.840]  government got caught running al Qaeda in Egypt and Libya and Syria they're
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.960]  putting cancer viruses in vaccines hepatitis in many of the vaccines they're
[37:55.960 --> 38:00.000]  they're they're creating the new flu the year before and it even comes out in
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.480]  the medical studies that they released the H1N1 a year before it came out five
[38:04.480 --> 38:09.720]  years ago and this stuff comes out and I'm I've got medical doctors telling me it
[38:09.720 --> 38:17.200]  a year before it comes out in the news I mean imagine they know MSG brain damages
[38:17.200 --> 38:26.520]  children they know it rewires their brains and we just let everybody eat it
[38:26.520 --> 38:31.000]  now there's four of scientists will create a new deadly flu strain just to
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.000]  prove they can no that's not why they're doing it H1N1 was a simulant that
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.080]  they released the year before that this came out in the EU this was
[38:41.080 --> 38:48.200]  declassified I had the head of the EU program on I had steak knife on and
[38:48.200 --> 38:52.960]  other British commandos who staged terror attacks the blame it on the IRA and
[38:52.960 --> 38:58.360]  then one of them was killed the week after he was on I had the DC Matamon and
[38:58.360 --> 39:02.920]  they killed her right after it you know how many people I've had on they've
[39:02.920 --> 39:09.280]  killed I'm not sitting here saying oh wow Alex you're amazing that's not what
[39:09.280 --> 39:14.120]  I'm saying I'm saying most people could not handle what I can handle and you know
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.440]  I can handle it because I was a maniac before I knew all this stuff and so I'm
[39:19.440 --> 39:27.640]  already crazy folks so you know what are they gonna do to me I get it the
[39:27.640 --> 39:31.920]  average and by crazy you know I'm already wild minded enough and primitive
[39:31.920 --> 39:36.800]  enough that I can handle this stuff the average person I get it cannot handle
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.120]  it and that's why evil worldwide always takes over because the average person
[39:41.120 --> 39:44.760]  just wants to go home and eat dinner and hang out with their kids and watch a
[39:44.760 --> 39:49.480]  movie or go out and tend their sheep if it was 5,000 years ago and they just
[39:49.480 --> 39:53.280]  want to go down and talk to the town elders and sit around and look at the
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.560]  sunset I get it you don't want to hear about what's happening off in Rome a
[39:57.560 --> 40:04.200]  thousand miles away if you you know lived up in Austria what's Austria today
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.520]  the Austria Goths but you better care because they're gonna come and take your
[40:08.520 --> 40:14.680]  family and make you slaves you know if you go back 2,000 plus years ago 2,060
[40:14.680 --> 40:21.280]  years ago when Caesar's forces were taking over those areas and so I know
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.960]  what they're doing I sit here and I watch a real horror movie every day a
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.600]  science fiction takeover with the robot cars and the robot aircraft and
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.080]  they're openly in all the publications saying again I go back to one I've
[40:35.080 --> 40:40.080]  mentioned a probably 500 times Bill Joy owner of Sun Microsystems top
[40:40.080 --> 40:46.360]  engineer says I went to a globalist meeting with 200 and something top
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.840]  leaders and we made the decision to kill everybody you know we could just let
[40:51.840 --> 40:55.680]  you have fun and play in the future but that hurts the environment so you know
[40:55.680 --> 41:00.440]  that the consensus is we'll just get rid of humanity and he put that in wired
[41:00.440 --> 41:08.240]  magazine back in what was it 2,000 the April issue and it's so frustrating I
[41:08.240 --> 41:13.760]  mean it's so frustrating when when when it's just all a big game like yesterday
[41:13.760 --> 41:19.760]  I was driving home and they had every trailer pulled over almost causing wrecks
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.200]  everywhere causing traffic in Austin Texas and you know by the time I saw a
[41:24.200 --> 41:29.240]  fifth white trailer pulled over and and and motorcycle cops running around like
[41:29.240 --> 41:32.560]  it was the end of the world and almost getting run over and walking out in
[41:32.560 --> 41:37.320]  traffic and blocking people to chase down the next yellow rider trucks white
[41:37.320 --> 41:43.560]  moving trucks u-hauls big double trailers semis pulling trailers and of course
[41:43.560 --> 41:46.600]  the cops were told I'm sure well we've got a Homeland Security tip there could
[41:46.600 --> 41:49.560]  be a weapon I don't think it was a drug tip because they were running around like
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.480]  they were saving the world and of course they do that to get everybody used to
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.320]  just running random checkpoints it's a drill the cops don't even know it's a
[41:59.320 --> 42:02.480]  drill I could tell by looking at them in the eyes in traffic watching these
[42:02.480 --> 42:06.800]  crazed police and their cruisers pulling people over and unmarks and just
[42:06.800 --> 42:11.440]  freaking out all over Austin because I drove from work through it for like 45
[42:11.440 --> 42:18.240]  minutes of traffic watching it and dodging police I personally saw them
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.840]  almost have two wrecks and you go why are you bringing that up it's just because
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.560]  I know how the programming works the threat fusion center tells them we think
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.960]  there could be a truck bomb I bet that's what it was or they thought it was a
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.160]  really big bust if you're gonna be famous when you find it it's a hundred
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.960]  kilos of cocaine you know that some cowboy got through the border and didn't
[42:40.960 --> 42:44.640]  pay their cut to El Hefe I mean I don't know but I but the way they were
[42:44.640 --> 42:49.680]  acting they were told we've got a terror threat of 5,000 pounds of plastic
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.000]  explosive they're gonna blow the Capitol up I mean I don't know but the police
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.760]  that kids can a cop call in the skies your voice maybe even tell the folks
[42:58.760 --> 43:02.640]  to answer the phone if you want to go on air what it was maybe I want to put you
[43:02.640 --> 43:04.760]  on air cuz I can tell if it's a cop in Austin
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.160]  I wouldn't get up in the phones up but I do kind of want to know can somebody
[43:08.160 --> 43:12.400]  Austin tell me what that was yesterday it was like a I know what you call it
[43:12.400 --> 43:15.400]  was like a checkpoint where they shut the highway down it was police on exit
[43:15.400 --> 43:20.120]  roads and and and and and the highway running around looking in the back
[43:20.120 --> 43:23.520]  slamming it and running and then and then pulling out in traffic and running
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.480]  to the next white trailer how many you know any trailers there are and they
[43:27.480 --> 43:29.720]  obviously didn't have a license plate number they didn't have a gender they
[43:29.720 --> 43:33.000]  were pulling over orange ones white ones mainly white ones and it was just
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.840]  ridiculous meanwhile the government's run by people that put cancer viruses in
[43:39.840 --> 43:45.240]  almost all the vaccines on record I mean we're being murdered in mass and the
[43:45.240 --> 43:49.000]  Obama says a nuke is gonna you know go off in New York and that's his number
[43:49.000 --> 43:55.720]  one fear when there's missing nukes and when the years before they had the
[43:55.720 --> 43:59.560]  cruise missiles that came up missing remember that
[44:01.920 --> 44:06.480]  oh I bet he's worried that would make his approval rating go from 30 points up
[44:06.480 --> 44:11.280]  to you know 99 did people be so scared and in militant enthusiasm from the
[44:11.280 --> 44:15.280]  psychology you get to attack the Russians or whoever you blame for it the
[44:15.280 --> 44:20.000]  Iranians you get to take liberties you get to pose as a savior they'll have
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.520]  Obama out there you know on the blast zone edge saying whoever did this was
[44:24.520 --> 44:30.040]  gonna pay and people say Alex we know you said this was coming but shut up
[44:30.040 --> 44:35.120]  about this on air we're gonna take you off the local stations but I mean when
[44:35.120 --> 44:37.600]  they do that I won't even be there when they said a nuke off that mean they'll
[44:37.600 --> 44:41.960]  just send a hit team over to kill me oh Alex Jones was found dead in his car
[44:41.960 --> 44:47.160]  he shot himself he'd been depressed never never will I kill myself never
[44:47.160 --> 44:51.720]  never never never I don't particularly want to go through a bunch of pain if I
[44:51.720 --> 44:55.960]  ever get cancer really sick but to get the word out I will accept Darth Vader
[44:55.960 --> 45:02.120]  level medical care I will take maximum I will I will go the whole nine yards I
[45:02.120 --> 45:06.800]  will I want every bit of life kicking and screaming and clawing will you drag
[45:06.800 --> 45:09.600]  me out of this world because not because I even want to stay in this world
[45:09.600 --> 45:14.000]  but because I want to stay in the fight on top of a heap of enemies clubbing
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.600]  their heads in in the info war I am not gonna bow down to these scum I'm gonna
[45:19.600 --> 45:23.320]  get my whole person over to the fight and Lord knows it's ugly but it's the
[45:23.320 --> 45:27.480]  best I can give it's all I can give and people need to find the animating
[45:27.480 --> 45:31.120]  contest of liberty they need to find their spirit and understand we're under
[45:31.120 --> 45:35.200]  an attack and not want to be part of it anymore and to tell the system we know
[45:35.200 --> 45:40.720]  what you're up to you're not protecting us you're feeding on us it's like a god
[45:40.720 --> 45:44.200]  protect some pigs he's got he's gonna slaughter at Christmas time you know
[45:44.200 --> 45:49.840]  slaughter in the fall for Christmas hams you don't protect us you squat on us
[45:49.840 --> 45:57.760]  and all of you that work for the system 99.99999999999 a real number we've
[45:57.760 --> 46:01.480]  done of the elite versus the seven and a half billion was point zero zero zero
[46:01.480 --> 46:07.120]  zero zero eight nine zeros and a point four two or something I remember I mean
[46:07.120 --> 46:10.320]  that's how many superclass there are in the globalist own words the Kissinger
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.640]  Institute the Kissinger group six thousand openly say they own us and
[46:14.640 --> 46:18.960]  we're a bunch of cattle slobs well you're sure help and turn people into
[46:18.960 --> 46:23.240]  cattle but let me tell you something jack I'm not cattle and I'm not here to be
[46:23.240 --> 46:28.080]  to be fed on by you people and by the way I've looked at you and what the art
[46:28.080 --> 46:32.120]  you're into and what you elites are into you people are ugly you people are
[46:32.120 --> 46:37.640]  stunted you people are mentally ill you are certainly not meant to run the whole
[46:37.640 --> 46:42.600]  show and that's why you've got to do it from stealth because you're the opposite
[46:42.600 --> 46:46.560]  of chivalry you're the opposite of honor you're the opposite of everything good
[46:46.560 --> 46:58.440]  you are coward filthy jealous envious grasping selfish scum and there are a
[46:58.440 --> 47:02.320]  lot of beautiful good people out there and it makes me sick to see them in a
[47:02.320 --> 47:08.840]  trance a literal medical trance the general public are in medical trances
[47:08.840 --> 47:15.400]  I was watching ESPN this morning with a sound off and they had some music video
[47:15.400 --> 47:19.320]  about basketball players and it was them on the bus everyone worshipping them
[47:19.320 --> 47:23.400]  but almost like in a martial law type deal and then I was reading the closed
[47:23.400 --> 47:27.120]  captioning of the music and how how great they are and everyone worshipping
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.600]  signed my ticket and it's been for the fans to all watch that and think this
[47:31.600 --> 47:37.280]  pumped up arrogant narcissist person with this look of sublime pleasure that
[47:37.280 --> 47:44.040]  they're being worshipped that's totally abnormal he's then going into the
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.040]  basketball thing but the weak-minded sit there and watch that in a trance and
[47:48.040 --> 47:53.960]  believe that's God believe that is unattain him they believe that is the
[47:53.960 --> 48:00.480]  ultimate in society and civilization so that their literal spirit is bound to
[48:00.480 --> 48:06.120]  worshipping rock stars worshipping hip-hop people worshipping sports people
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.280]  when I mean I worship the creator not the creation but if at least the ancients
[48:11.280 --> 48:16.080]  you know looked at the night sky and comments and the beauty and the sound
[48:16.080 --> 48:22.240]  of a babbling brook and the animus worship that they worship the woman's
[48:22.240 --> 48:31.880]  power to create a baby they worshiped life they worshiped male vero power they
[48:31.880 --> 48:41.240]  worshipped being honorable and strong not not facsimile mindless garbage designed
[48:41.240 --> 48:47.000]  to absolutely put a spell on people that's what it is I put a spell on you
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.880]  to where they don't even know that they're on a planet hurtling through deep
[48:51.880 --> 48:56.120]  space orbiting a Sun they don't even know they're sitting on the ruins of
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.840]  fantastic life that came before us they don't even understand the mysteries of
[49:00.840 --> 49:06.280]  the universe and the time-space continuum and the interdimensional layers and
[49:06.280 --> 49:12.960]  just the trillions of galaxies and the untold incredible gift of
[49:12.960 --> 49:15.680]  consciousness
[49:18.520 --> 49:22.960]  they're dead already the system killed them from birth if they couldn't
[49:22.960 --> 49:27.520]  physically abort them they set them in front of television to become matrix
[49:27.520 --> 49:32.880]  heads who plug in an interface with a false reality controlled by a bunch of
[49:32.880 --> 49:37.840]  sycophantic narcissist psychopaths eugenicists control freaks who get to
[49:37.840 --> 49:44.200]  then sit there and take our species and literally sabotage it vandalize it
[49:44.200 --> 49:51.840]  mutate it destroying our actual DNA wrecking the global biosphere DNA in a
[49:51.840 --> 49:58.440]  giant act of mass sacrifice of the planet a huge planetary sacrifice is
[49:58.440 --> 50:04.080]  Satan's goal to destroy the planet after squeezing every ounce of torture and
[50:04.080 --> 50:09.360]  pain out of it on a mass scale just as a Jeffrey Dahmer for days leans over their
[50:09.360 --> 50:13.680]  victim chain down torturing them doing the most horrible things to them the
[50:13.680 --> 50:18.840]  devil takes thousands of years to slowly build a system to wreck everything and
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.440]  to feed and suck off the human suffering of the babies and the innocence of the
[50:23.440 --> 50:28.400]  women and the destroyed dreams and the wrecked civilizations and the sunken
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.440]  treasure of humanity never to be fully realized sucking out the very essence of
[50:34.440 --> 50:40.360]  God's incredible creation made in his image sacrificing God's creation in a
[50:40.360 --> 50:46.200]  vain attempt to pull down the mighty foundations of the creator of all the

[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:07.120]  Jacari Jackson Jacari is just a great reporter and here is his report GoPro
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:16.360]  superman we'll come back with a ton of breaking news after that
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:33.920]  superman
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.960]  looks pretty cool doesn't it the things we can do with modern technologies
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.680]  such as the drone that made that viral YouTube video but just like much of our
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:53.200]  modern technologies drones are ripe for abuse when is a drone picture a benefit
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.040]  to society when does it become stalking when does it invade privacy how close to
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.680]  a home can a drone go I'm in my home and there's a demonstration out front I go
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.080]  to peek out the window and there's a drone facing me well whoever was running
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:14.160]  it turned it around quickly and it crashed I'm not sure why anyone would
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.200]  want to peek in the window of senator Feinstein but regardless I'm glad the
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.320]  senator is at least speaking out about the issue of privacy she had previously
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.080]  said that it's okay to spy on US citizens and may now be rethinking her
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.560]  choice of words don't get me wrong though there are plenty of harmless uses
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:37.040]  for a drone such as land surveying or making YouTube videos but when does that
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.160]  become a violation of someone's privacy for example is it an illegal search and
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.720]  seizure if police fly a drone over someone's property the mayor of Seattle
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.600]  seems to think so but there are plenty of other cities that would disagree
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:56.240]  deputies can fly this 50-pound shadow Hawk unmanned helicopter a powerful
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.880]  camera on the front is controlled with this game-like console and the
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.960]  manufacturer says this one's even designed to carry weapons you have a
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.040]  stun baton where you can actually engage somebody had altitude with the
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.480]  aircraft and a stun baton stun baton essentially disable a suspect if one of
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:16.280]  these things quote malfunctions and hits an unintended target who if anyone
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.720]  will be held accountable not to mention the weirdos who use drones as high-tech
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:29.080]  peeping toms and now for the two big words predator drones you will never see
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:35.360]  it coming we've seen how inaccurate lethal drones have been overseas they've
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.520]  even killed US citizens so why on earth would anyone want to bring these things
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:45.880]  to the states it is great to see American machines helping to promote
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:56.000]  peace abroad so then tell me why can we use these machines here why is America so
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.160]  robo phobic so in closing if you're innocently filming a class project or
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.240]  trying to find the best place to install a pool on your land then go ahead but
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.560]  remember while we're busy watching YouTube videos they're busy watching us
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:18.800]  you can find more reports at info wars calm and the big issue the rest of the
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.800]  story is it's about an autonomous army that the globalist control cutting the
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.200]  general public in humanity out of the equation they've been trying for

[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.280]  escalation by the Russians so far they've been grabbing their own bases but
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.720]  now they're saying that ships that were docked in that area of the Ukraine are
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.880]  theirs and I guess that's part of the ongoing sanctions war Russian citizens
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:33.280]  are now boycotting US companies and EU companies in their own boycott this is
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.960]  only gonna hurt the people on both sides and they've kicked the Russians
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.840]  obviously two days ago out of the G8 which is a new Cold War kickoff for
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:48.720]  everybody to know in its invasion annexation of Crimea now Crimea voted

[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.160]  there folks but this is the key of post so it's from their perspective in its
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.680]  invasion annexation of Crimea Russia has seized 51 vessels belonged to the
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.920]  Ukrainian Navy according to information compiled by Dmitry Tomokchuk
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.320]  director of the Center for Military and Political Research in Kiev among the
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.280]  Ukrainian vessels reportedly captured by the Russians are the submarines

[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.760]  stocks of petroleum products in Ukraine will last 28 29 days said at today's
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.320]  press conference the Minister of Energy and coal industry speaking on the
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:53.320]  situation with oil then ensure there is a quiet stable that's quoted from them
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:58.360]  so it sounds like Babel I translated into Egypt into English suddenly it's not
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:05.400]  English it's Egypt today oil reserves will last 28 29 days he said at the same
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:11.000]  time the minister noted the significant risk reduction in the supply and rising
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.960]  gas prices as of March 25th 2014 in Ukraine underround gas storage facilities
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:24.520]  located only had 7 billion cubic meters of gas which sounds like a lot but it's
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:30.160]  not and again this is translated from Ukrainian folks it's why it sounds like
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.920]  I'm reading this wrong so I keep backing up thinking I'm reading it wrong but
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.360]  it's just translated into English so it doesn't sound right up there can be
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:44.520]  about 2 billion is not the quantity that scares experts it would be possible to
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:51.440]  hold only a week it all deepens on what kind of regime will be whether we can
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:59.720]  take 20 million cubic meters meters of gas to reserve and so on we have come
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.520]  to a planet to eat your women and children think you tell that was
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:11.000]  computer translated wow Ukrainian court bans Russian TV broadcast the majority
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.560]  of Ukrainian providers have stopped broadcasting for main Russian TV channels
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.440]  in a move that Russian Foreign Minister calls a violation of international
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.360]  obligations and an attack on media freedom it certainly can be considered
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.280]  only in terms of an attack on democratic freedoms and a violation of
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.200]  international obligations by Ukraine the Ministry's Commissioner on Human
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:39.080]  Rights told RAI RIA Novostok and it goes on from there so there is some of the
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:45.840]  news on that front another article out of the New Eastern Outlook linking
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.480]  through the Reuters and others deals with the recent attacks by Turkish Air Force
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.760]  on targets over the Syrian border to back up the terror groups they've been
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.520]  training in Turkey to infiltrate into the country backing al-Qaeda tensions have
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.120]  risen once again along the Syrian Turkish border as Turkey downs a Syrian
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.760]  warplane and terrorists backed by Turkish troops storm across the border and
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.360]  down Syria's western coast into the province Turkey's renewed vigor appears
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.120]  to be part of a result of pressure placed on Turkey's Prime Minister US backed
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.480]  mobs who have been taking to the streets for four months seeking his ouster
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.840]  citing Reuters and AFP RT's article Turkey down Syrian jet near border for
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.520]  airspace violation it just goes on that they were trying to stop planes giving
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.880]  air support to Syrian forces and again I'm not rooting for the Syrian forces but
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.800]  I am I mean they didn't attack anybody they didn't start the war three years
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:50.480]  ago our degenerate evil Banker run government has been openly on record
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:54.720]  funding al-Qaeda's the main force to blow up churches kill people in mass it
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.280]  is a serious war crime by any Geneva Convention common sense Magna Carta
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:05.840]  Bill of Rights Constitution Monroe doctrine any way you look at it it is so
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:15.280]  evil that we are involved in this it is the absolute final signpost on a
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:23.680]  bankrupt morally evil completely amoral out-of-control military policy of the
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.520]  globalists that run this country and are using our military and our lives and our
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.120]  money to carry out this type of evil garbage and I gotta say I commend our
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.440]  military from the grassroots enlisted to the non-commissioned to the officers
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:41.320]  right at the top they said we are not gonna train any more al-Qaeda at these
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:49.960]  bases inside Western Iraq to infiltrate into into Syria it had been mainly
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.240]  British and South African and other special forces and Qatari and Saudi
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.640]  Arabian training the al-Qaeda forces and the last straw was when they ordered
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:06.000]  us special forces this is about six months ago to go in and train them and
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.600]  they're and I've been I've confirmed this but also saw some inklings in the
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:16.440]  news there was basically a quiet stand down by the military because the these
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.720]  al-Qaeda people are so arrogant and so out of control they're basically like
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.320]  pirates that just wanted to excuse to rob and loot and kill they come from all
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.120]  over the world but mainly Saudi Arabia is the center of it that they openly
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.640]  brag remember on the BBC in the video when they were in Libya and they had
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.920]  signs up they taken Libya they taken Tripoli they kill Qaddafi supposedly and
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.640]  they said they said look
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.200]  they had signs but we're also saying in English we have taken Tripoli today
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:52.760]  tomorrow Damascus the capital of Syria and then next America and they're now in
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.800]  the news he in the BBC in Reuters in AFP saying we're going to attack Europe now
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.600]  with the weapons we've gotten Syria and the weapons we got in Benghazi so finally
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:10.600]  our military finally it was just given so many illegal evil orders they said
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.800]  no we're not going to train these guys because the word is and well they've
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.200]  bragged in the newspapers that yes I am here killing Libyans and I'm killing
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:22.560]  Syrians but I I want to kill Americans after and I will kill Americans after
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.360]  I'm done with Assad and the military sits there going we're training and giving
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:33.600]  weapons to people that literally killed US soldiers in Iraq and again it was bad
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.440]  that we were in Iraq to begin with but the point is we're now arming the people
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.800]  that were killing our troops in Iraq I mean it's just so over the top folks
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:50.120]  that the military said no the evil of the globalist is going so far now that
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.240]  the military is saying no
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.560]  and it's very very frustrating it's now admitted if you go back years ago they
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.800]  would debate it it's now admitted that 60 plus percent of the main battle force
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.920]  is al-Qaeda and the council on fine relations wrote an article a few years
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.200]  ago saying quote why we need al-Qaeda in Syria and they are now the main force
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.920]  and so Ted Cruz ran Paul after my shelf in the drudge report in countless others
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.080]  world that daily documented that our government was running al-Qaeda then
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.200]  that gave the moral and research support to good Republicans that are good not
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:32.360]  the establishment ones to go out and tell the truth so that we could get out
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:38.360]  of bed with these people and then we go further and the TSA who today is calling
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.160]  to have armed agents at the airport now so I guess they can shoot you if you make
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:48.200]  a joke they'll arrest you if you make a joke well I guess now in this running
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:55.520]  man's scenario that you know we can tell them hey we're sick of being told that
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:02.920]  we're terrorists and that we're all suspects in this country when openly you
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:08.320]  have been demonizing patriots and making us the new terror threat this is a
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.680]  fraud we reject it we're forcing a national debate about this that you're
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.400]  switching from al-Qaeda to domestic groups and saying you believe domestic
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.280]  groups are about to blow up federal buildings attack schools and shopping
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.840]  malls in all your drills and they're going to link up with Muslim extremists
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.120]  that is asinine you're the ones linked up with Muslim extremists that's in the
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.280]  army work all the documents look it up type in army trains to take on tea
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.240]  party you'll get washed in times Forbes who covered it after we got the
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.840]  documents and they say right there the tea party links up with Muslim extremists
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:47.600]  folks the tea parties one sin in my view is that they are Islamophobic and I'm
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.760]  not saying Islam doesn't have some serious issues that it's being radicalized
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.360]  across the board but you know it's wrong to say all Islam is basically wants to
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.000]  kill Westerners and you know aren't tolerant Muslims are tolerant most
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  Muslim groups are tolerant worldwide but the problem is Saudi Arabia is on
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.520]  showing the radical Muslims and our government's open in the door for them
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.360]  but but separate from that the reason I raise that the tea party is not in bed
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.920]  with al Qaeda and everybody knows that's ridiculous and it's not gonna fly
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:22.240]  that dog is not gonna hunt and continuing with the dog analogies to the
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.240]  police and military do you really have a dog in the fight with homeland security
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:31.480]  now saying domestic grips and political speech of the target you really want to
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.840]  sign on to this you really cuz I mean that by every yardstick historically is
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.200]  becoming bad guys and I think the answer is the average cop I talked to is
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.120]  appalled and freaked out and knows we're in trouble so that's good so let's not

[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.600]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:22.000]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.080]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point

[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:56.720]  toll rises it's now up to 63 dead and is reportedly spreading into nearby
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.800]  countries this is a big deal because Ebola is about the nastiest thing
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.840]  naturally occurring out there in many scientists think it was manufactured in
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:12.720]  a laboratory Ebola victims facing 90% death risk drugs start to emerge though
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.720]  to treat it and to give you some chance that is certainly good news speaking of
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.600]  90% kill rates they've got different mouse pox's designed for humans that
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.480]  kill 98% in the university studies and guess what they published online eight
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:33.400]  years ago it's about eight nine years ago it's a big controversy how to
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:40.200]  create it so that any university level laboratory could make it that's always a
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:45.280]  good idea huh well dr. Pionk at UT says the airborne Ebola will soon be
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.880]  released and he works in the biology department and on his official website
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.120]  he talks about how he loves Lucifer in a druidic outfits but I mean a guy that
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.840]  loves Lucifer talks about the airborne Ebola killing everyone I pointed that
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.440]  out and the FBI did do their job and go visit him and he he promised that he
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:08.840]  didn't mean that two years ago and look that up if you want I thought it was
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:14.040]  interesting you know he works with that stuff and he says 90% of us need to die
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:18.800]  I had his graduate students who were doctors now threatened me and we published
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.160]  some of their letters and linked to their graduate papers we went and did
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.560]  research on them where they they said that they want to kill everyone and that
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.720]  he didn't go far enough that mr. Jones you have to admit they said in the email
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:35.720]  one of them that we are a disease and a parasite and we've got to be exterminated
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:45.400]  I mean I mean come on everybody knows that so pray for the folks out in Africa
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:52.120]  in Guiana dealing with that Chileans are worried over the string of 300 quakes
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.560]  in the north Gerald Salente barely got out of a hotel it was in a mega quake
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.760]  he was there in that big one well the three in our earthquakes have shaken
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.680]  Chile's far northern coast this past week keeping people on the edge as
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.640]  scientists say there is no way to tell if the unusual string of tremors is a
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.720]  harbinger of impending disaster the unnerving activity began with a strong
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:19.120]  magnitude 6.7 quake on March 16th that caused more than 100,000 people to
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.720]  briefly evacuate low-lying areas although no tsunami materialized and there was
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:29.840]  little physical damage from the shaking here's another headline there's a lot
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.280]  of articles about superbugs now why you're always sick we overuse the
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.440]  antibiotics and there's new superbugs both viral and bacterial because we're
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:43.360]  creating them or say don't tell you that about a month ago Sharon Gilbert was
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:49.560]  hit with a runny nose sore throat and a cough the whole snotty works a few weeks
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.640]  later she thought she's recovered then her husband Derek got sick again
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.440]  suddenly she was sick as well that's partly because the common cold can last
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:02.280]  longer than many people think up to two weeks from the primary symptoms perhaps
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.240]  weeks through that no folks there's all these articles about why you're staying
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.240]  sick longer it's because we're unhealthy folks and the GMO has been a long cold
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:16.760]  winter I mean back when we had a mini ice age in the 1600s in Europe there were
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.920]  all sorts of plagues then many plagues because it would stay cold right through
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:29.480]  into May frozen sometimes and that's when the viruses in the bacteria just
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.760]  spread like wildfire in the closed quarters people don't get vitamin D
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.880]  from Sun you run out of that with it in two to three months without Sun that's
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.800]  why people in Northern Clines have white skin and less melanin because you need
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.560]  more of it of course Cass Sunstein and his paper so they want to outlaw
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.760]  conspiracy theories he said number one that humans need Sun I'm not kidding
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.600]  he wants the regulations are look it up says that you should not be able to say
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.360]  that Sun is needed it's universally known that by all medical doctors that you
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.800]  need some Sun the calculations vary for your type of skin but if you've got a
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:14.360]  really sensitive skin you then need to take vitamin D but doesn't matter to
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:19.600]  them Cass Sunstein doesn't want you getting Sun and it's true the Sun will
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:25.040]  kill you but not having it will kill you quicker killing yourself to live I mean
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.680]  if I'm down or tired I just can go out get some Sun even winter Sun I'm
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:33.600]  energized because folks plants are the only thing that needs Sun understand
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:39.080]  that we need Sun and more of it and I'll just say it right now I love the Sun
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:44.960]  and I love being sun kissed there's no better feeling than swimming two miles
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:49.600]  hot sunny day in a lake and then get down with your backburned we're on the March

[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:55.400]  good telephones which is very rare nowadays 800-259-9231 again I think it
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:01.120]  bears more than just one day of talk Obama's number one threat he says to
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:08.080]  America is a bomb going off in Manhattan in the middle of New York City
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:15.120]  that would make Obama a dictator instantly so if that happens and they've
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.560]  been making the preparation for a dictatorship of the bureaucracy they
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:24.600]  may not want Obama to be that guy maybe the next guy I mean if a nuke went off
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.520]  in New York and Rand Paul wasn't involved they could nuke and then have such
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:35.000]  a crisis going that Rand Paul would be impeached if he didn't come out and
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.800]  agree with the Pentagon and whoever they blamed and then he would be offered
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:46.720]  martial law powers to save America and he would be assassinated if he didn't
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.080]  agree to become dictator and I'm not saying that's gonna happen with Rand Paul
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.240]  but he could end up being president because a good chance of it being
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.080]  president thank you there's a good chance of it being the next president
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:59.360]  there's that much of a wave of libertarianism I'm saying the mind of the
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.560]  wicked New World Order is they're not gonna give up their main hydrohead the
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:09.000]  US that they've captured I mean it's the big one taken down the world for them
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.240]  because we had the moral high ground we had the free market we had the wealth
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.440]  we had the fighters we had the dedicated military people we were the best we
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.320]  were exceptional Putin says yeah last year stop saying you're exceptional so
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.560]  it's okay for you to do all this well we're still exceptional exceptionally
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.840]  evil exceptionally overrun with corrupt people exceptionally decadent we
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:33.400]  drink more liquor on average than the Russians do now we're drinking ourselves
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:39.200]  of death and I'm not up on some high horse folks let's get all that straight
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.040]  but I can recognize what's wrong with our society
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:50.880]  and half the time when I go off on some tangent I don't even know where it started
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:36:01.040]  the point is is I want to hear from you 800-259-9231 and you know I wake up at
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.000]  three four in the morning freaked out about the fact that if I was the New
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.560]  World Order I'd set off a nuke in New York City and I've been saying that for
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:15.200]  about five years and I just keep it keeps the brain is an electrochemical
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.760]  computer with the unconscious the subconscious and the conscious the
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.520]  subconscious is incredibly powerful probably some scientists think a hundred
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.080]  times more powerful than the conscious minds the conscious is focused by the
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.960]  cerebral cortex and it's tiny you've got a general attempt at the subconscious
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:35.480]  to be able to access that and I'm able to access my subconscious by
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.960]  understanding the archetypes but hardly anybody's in contact with their
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:46.960]  with their unconscious only in a dream state you access that but top cops
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:54.560]  throughout the ages who are known as great great investigators can't tell you
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:58.800]  why they know who did it and like every time are right and those guys come along
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.440]  through history they do not want those people now in law enforcement those
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.680]  people are always out there naturally and now they're phasing a mountain going
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.360]  for folks with below 100 IQs because smart people have empathy smart people
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:14.600]  will buck orders that are obviously wrong smart people don't want their kids
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:20.240]  growing up in a corrupt society so they won't take the payoff more often than
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:27.240]  people that have low IQs smart people are more honorable generally because they
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:35.280]  have an idea of what's really valuable in this world but when you sit here and
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:42.920]  you look at how corrupt our society has become it is just a nightmare situation
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:50.720]  and I naturally can study all the data all the dots and then not even know why
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.920]  I go on air and say they might in fact I think they're thinking about New King
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.400]  New York City so they can attack and blame the Iranians and the Russians while
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.120]  clamping down domestically and then now they're hyping it and some would say no
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.080]  they're getting talking points from you I've had people tell me that stop the
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:12.000]  scenario should come up with oh give me a break that's a no-brainer because I
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.680]  can then say at a conscious level I don't know why I'm saying that but then I
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.040]  can walk it back well no I know their history I know what they've done in the
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:27.400]  past I know what they've hyped I know what they've done I know what would what
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:32.640]  is ingrained in the archetypal fears from the Cold War duck and cover I know
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.040]  about the missing nukes it only takes a small team to plant the bomb it's easily
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.160]  deniable very small teams very compartmentalized you can jacket it
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.480]  whatever isotope you want to frame whoever you want and then just thousands
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.520]  of other points come in I could sit here for literally 12 hours with a taper
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.760]  quarter going the crew's seen this when we're doing stuff I said it for an hour
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:56.320]  and just spew the reasons that's the problem my conscious brain has to go to
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.080]  the next area and go data retrieves data retrieves why do I think that this
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.760]  instead I can just go they're gonna nuke New York if I was them I'd nuke New
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.720]  York that's like that's like a detective hunch because you just got all the data
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.480]  it's not a hunch you've already got all the data and you bam sandwich it in it's
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:17.600]  like top profilers that are able to actually after tracking somebody for
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.800]  years actually pick the next area they're gonna kill and be waiting for
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:26.840]  because you get in the mind of the enemy and that's what's so horrible is that I
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:33.400]  mean I know what these people are thinking is horrible it's horrible and it
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:38.160]  just goes on and on and on and on and I don't know if they're gonna set nukes
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.240]  off in New York they might hit Dallas they might hit Denver they might hit
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:49.320]  Cleveland and why do I say that one time I saw Gary Hart and Warren Revin about
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:56.400]  a year after 9-11 on hardball again the same place they announced 9-11 in July of
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:02.320]  2001 they announced the attack somebody's got to dig the tape up they said
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:06.880]  other things about the change in America and of course Chris Matthews is high
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.560]  level worked in multiple administrations kind of a Carl Rove type for
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.320]  Democrats they got really exciting was thank you what is this announcement and
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:19.280]  it was all a tell to the establishment with very thinly veiled heading up the
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.200]  Council on Foreign Relations reorganization plan Hart-Rubin Commission
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:28.280]  under the Rand Corporation directives but prepared by Council on Foreign
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.000]  Relations to reorganize America into an authoritarian police state you can go
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.120]  read the report issue 10 months before 9-11 and Gary Hart two days of 9-11
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.000]  said we're gonna use this disaster to bring in a new world order while
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.840]  chairing the Hart-Rubin Commission at the Council on Foreign Relations headquarters
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:50.920]  in New York City at Pratt House it was on C-SPAN and they're on the show and he
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.400]  says there's gonna be big buildings they're gonna be coming down there's
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.440]  gonna be army on the streets this is gonna be the change this is gonna be
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:04.400]  the beginning and Rudman's look at him like oh man this is hardcore and they're
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.680]  very proud of themselves because I guess their plan got adopted by the PNAC
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.480]  plan they merged those two plans the Hart-Rubin Commission with the PNAC
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.480]  new American Century plan and they were just publicly announcing it to the
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.680]  establishment and I went on there the next day and I said they're gonna blow
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.840]  up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden because I've
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.960]  already seen all the pieces and when they did that I knew about globalist
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:33.960]  bragging I just learned about that after I don't already been on air six seven
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:40.560]  years at that point and six seven years so I clicked and went with my gut on that
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:43.800]  and then they did it of course I didn't have enough power to stop them I said
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:46.120]  call the White House tell them don't blow the World Trade Center up and rest of
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.880]  it that's all on record just video that audio that this time I saw about a year
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:57.120]  or maybe it's two years it's 2003 and I saw the Hart-Rubin Commission on there
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:04.160]  again and they said the terrorists are going to nuke New York Dallas Cleveland or
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:12.280]  Denver and of course when they nuke those cities no one is is gonna go back and
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:15.840]  say why did those two guys say that on there because that was a message to the
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:22.200]  establishment get out of those cities probably 10 years before they do it I
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:26.440]  guess it's 10 or 11 years now I mean you start learning these are psychopath gang
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:32.400]  leaders literally ringwraiths giving orders over television to each other
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:36.240]  that's why they have the Pentagon reading newspaper articles and op-ed pieces
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:43.200]  and ads for code words for crime groups and others that really goes on people
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.040]  pay to have things put in the newspaper because the operative doesn't even know
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:51.520]  who's hiring them and they'll have people working in a news agency who the
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.320]  news doesn't even know they're an operative writing an article to give
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.920]  orders the best place to give orders doesn't play me and I sit here now and
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:02.000]  I see them giving orders all the time I can't even watch the news when a
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.600]  globalist is on because a lot of times they start giving orders and I'm trying
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.600]  to figure out exactly who the orders are to I mean I cannot run a giant counter
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.800]  intelligence operation by myself is what I'm saying I've come to that
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.920]  realization I literally have the mental tools to understand these people and
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:22.040]  fight them but it's no one could do this by themselves and I'm not it's just
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:28.400]  freaking me out I mean I know this is real I wish it wasn't real I wish it
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:36.280]  wasn't happening but it is I told you they had hubs in all the buildings all
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.520]  the all the telecommunications buildings in 1996 to grab all your data I
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.840]  didn't have a hunch on that I was pointed out by engineers what was in the
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.600]  telecommunications act and and all I'm trying to tell new listeners is this
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:58.160]  stuff is real the information unfolding is real and I can be wrong about little
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.240]  things here and there and in my interpretation might not be correct in
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.720]  the final equation all I know is in the general direction I'm going we're dead
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:12.880]  on and I know there are a lot of good people in the system but I don't know
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:19.920]  what to do okay all I know is I told you if they start hyping nukes going off in
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:25.920]  Manhattan I probably said this 300 times the last five years if they start
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:32.760]  saying get ready for nukes to go off they're getting ready and are seriously
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:40.320]  thinking about doing it and the targets are Manhattan Dallas Cleveland and
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.880]  Denver now they may change and hit something else but people that I saw
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:51.720]  publicly call the 9-11 attack said that and they did what they said they would
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.320]  do the first time
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:09.440]  Gary Hart wrote a letter to Ahmed Denizied Denizod you can pull a letter up
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.560]  he published it having a post saying our government stage Gulf of Tonkin the USS
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:22.200]  May in 1898 and other events we Oklahoma City I think he said in there we will we
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:25.560]  will do that again and go to war with you don't just think because 80 plus
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:29.640]  percent of Americans don't want war with you that we won't attack you and blow
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:34.560]  your country off the face of the math of you don't do what you're told we are
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.560]  changed reporters this is all on video you type up we are change talk to Gary
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:42.560]  Hart they talk to him and they go what about your letter about false flags he
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:46.600]  was never wrote such a letter they pull the letter out he begins sweating and
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.000]  stuttering because you're not supposed to know this stuff you're like an animal
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.800]  he publishes a public letter called unsolicited advice the government of
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:58.600]  Iran saying we will stage terror attacks and blame you in the one of the biggest
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:04.920]  online newspapers in the world and when confronted by people wearing sunglasses
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:09.160]  like they live he literally freaks out and starts gulping and sweats starts
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:13.560]  coming out profusely and he looks like a sketchy that's had his cloak pulled off
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:18.920]  of him or something I mean he looks completely whacked out of his mind and
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:25.400]  starts stuttering you know they've got the video up on screen that's their
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:33.480]  guys names Matt LaPace they're asking the questions and he denies it at first
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:39.360]  just like they say there's no penalty well the penalty starting no there's not
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:49.480]  liar hey you said I can keep my doctor I never said that I'm gonna go to your
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:52.040]  phone call so I haven't got to the news I haven't plugged anything I'm gonna be
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:57.080]  able to finance this place but oh by the way you heard me talk about super bugs
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.520]  I'm not supposed to frustrate he denied he wrote a letter saying we stayed
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:04.920]  terror attacks to us because he thinks we're animals hey we're not animals
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:10.200]  jerk we see you up there on television going nooks are gonna go up in these
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:16.440]  cities that's how you conquer America you set one nuke off you said five nukes
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:19.880]  off do you ever think of that it's not just outside powers that might want to
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:23.920]  fully take over and become god kings you ever think it might be this dirtbag
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:30.680]  government you think it's fun getting on air and talking like this you think I
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:36.160]  like absolutely put myself in the furnace in the fiery furnace because
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.640]  that's what I'm doing and I'm not a hero folks I want to survive it's normal to
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:46.200]  want to fight tyranny you know there's super bugs going around you know there's
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.480]  chest and bacterial pneumonia that people are getting four or five times over again
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.560]  when they use antibiotics the antibiotics are ceasing to work I've had a lot of
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:56.800]  family I've had crew Weldon Henson in our office we should have him do a
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.920]  testimonial I just thought of this he took multiple rounds of antibiotics from
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:05.200]  the VA would not knock out his bacterial infection as long as I think he was to
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.080]  pneumonia yet he drank and I'm not saying do this because it is toxic in
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.440]  large levels and we do not even recommend you take this on a regular basis
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.760]  like most of the little silver makers do because we made it so strong it's
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.560]  survival super survival type silver it's the strongest we could get
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.160]  manufactured by the third largest laboratory in the United States the
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.640]  electrical process is patented and nobody has got silver this strong it took a
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:37.280]  six months to get it produced it's silver bullet and Weldon I think he
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.880]  said he drank half a bottle over four days and it knocked it out now again it's
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:48.120]  silver you need to put the the pioneer people he's put silver dollars in their
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.760]  milk to keep it better longer and you put a silver dollar on a baby's belly when
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.240]  it was born because it was known that it it warded off germs they didn't know why

[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.360]  been no shortage of controversy during President Obama's tenure operation
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:51.680]  passenger is internal revenue service the National Security Administration and
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.760]  Benghazi to name a few it is clear that this administration has made many
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:59.520]  questions that the leadership standards that are expected from the executive
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:03.720]  branch of the United States to impeach because the letter wanted to impeach
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:09.640]  Obama and many other leaders to impeach means to accuse of wrongdoing the
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.680]  Constitution allows the House of Representatives to impeach a president
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:19.000]  for treason bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors this is a high
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.960]  standard that is not met by sharp disagreement on policy no matter how
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:27.400]  deeply or sincerely felt you should know that if and when there is an
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:31.920]  appropriate time no I get it so they're talking about maybe they'll impeach him

[01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:02.600]  ability of the American people so why are the social engineers adding it to the
[01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:06.720]  water symbol dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.840]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the

[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:44.360]  impeachment if a movement starts to do that well Ted Cruz Rand Paul and others
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:51.040]  have basically said that people get behind them they will move for impeachment
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.840]  and it needs to happen and I know there's more people involved in bad then
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:04.120]  than just folks like Obama but you have to bring someone down on the government
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.400]  so the other ones don't think they can engage in criminal activity with

[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:51.880]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:56.080]  floor. Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation

[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.080]  intelligence. Luke Falls flag. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:08.640]  achievement today in our nation's effort to defeat Carlisle flag.
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.160]  Alabama is taking responsibility for shooting down a US helicopter more than
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:17.360]  30 people were killed and reports this morning that most of them are US Navy
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:23.280]  SEAL. There may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down and use the use
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:27.520]  for the excuse to accelerate the next war. There's one thing that has unified
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.040]  Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between is that we all hated the bank
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:36.280]  bailout. The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:42.240]  buying spree. It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. Today it
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:47.600]  is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million. They
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:51.520]  estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.920]  reeducations and when I say eliminate I need kill. I'm here to warn people you
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:02.400]  keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game. It's not a game. It's one of the lines of the
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:08.040]  information war. It's Alex Jones. That's right ladies and gentlemen we're
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:11.720]  having a powerful transmission today exposing the globalist. Obama has been
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:15.600]  warning saying his biggest threat, his biggest concern is a mushroom cloud over
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:19.200]  New York City. Someone's smuggling a nuke in and that means the Russians of the
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:24.120]  Iranians. What about the globalist that have captured the country who set up a
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:28.120]  police state and are preparing for a massive disaster to seize total control
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:32.200]  and shut down their political enemies once and for all and capture America?
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:39.960]  Would someone attack their own power structure to seize total control and to
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:49.240]  basically become above the law? That is the larger question and here is Obama
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:54.920]  again a few days ago talking about just this entering the idea of just a
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:59.680]  phantom nuke threat. Not even saying who's behind it but don't you worry he's
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:04.760]  gonna protect you from it a by taking your rights away and b if it happens
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:09.800]  well you know he's gonna have to really take everybody's rights to keep and
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:14.840]  safe next time and do whatever he wants and take your pension funds of course as
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:23.280]  well. So let's go ahead and go to that clip. And so my response then continues to
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:28.880]  be what I believe today which is Russia's actions are a problem. They don't
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:34.480]  pose the number one national security threat to the United States. I continue
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:40.840]  to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:46.880]  nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan which is part of the reason why the
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.400]  United States. And that's at the Hague and he also said something true in that
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:58.520]  speech which is very rare. Very rare. He said Russia is a regional power and is
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:08.960]  being dealt major defeats. Yes NATO with the EU went in when they wouldn't join
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.040]  the EU to be signed on to all their debts and looted on record. They went in and
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:17.440]  hired a bunch of thugs all over the government take 93% of the country. The
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:21.480]  Russians grabbed what was historically theirs used to be part of Russia and they
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:25.440]  totally they were making deals business deals with Ukraine peaceably and was
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:29.880]  really helping Russia major defeat of Russia. The media spends it all Putin
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:34.840]  just got shown. Yeah or you know they spent it you know Putin just showed
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.440]  Obama. See I have trouble even joking and telling a lie because I meant to say
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:44.080]  oh my gosh Putin's really showing Obama and I said who Putin's really getting
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:48.600]  shown because Putin's really getting shown and it's not that I romanticize
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:51.920]  the Russians it's that they're surrounded the globalists are trying to
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:58.520]  bring them down and compared to the people running our country and compared
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:02.720]  to the globalist compared to the communist Chinese I mean Russia is very
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.880]  mild. I've said on a scale of zero being neutral to this country's well-being in
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:12.080]  our national security and and the providence of our republic and the
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.760]  world. Russia is about a one threat. China is about a seven. The New World
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:22.440]  Order's at 11. They're 110%. They are over the top and they're over the top
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:27.080]  with a wall of lies on purpose to condition you to accept lies. We have a
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:32.320]  Harry Reid clip that's coming up. Harry Reid, people aren't educated on how to
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:39.240]  use the internet. The Democratic senator, that's an oxymoron, said that
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:43.880]  healthcare.gov has never been broken, never had a problem and and and Obamacare
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:47.720]  works great. As Ellen DeGeneres said, it works wonderful. Everyone loves it. We
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.160]  should be thankful to their leader. Close quote. Harry Reid, and they're grabbing
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:14:05.480]  the clip right now, Harry Reid said that well I mean why quoting? We actually have
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.320]  the clip. There are some people who are not like my grandchildren who can handle
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.640]  everything so easily on the internet and these people need a little extra time.
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:21.320]  It's not the example they gave us a 63-year-old woman came in to the
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:26.040]  store and she said I almost got it every time I just about got there it would
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:30.440]  cut me off. We have a lot of people just like this now through no fault of the
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:36.640]  internet because people are not educated how to use the internet. So this is not
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:42.040]  anything. So there you go. We repeated that a couple times. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:47.400]  this is unprecedented. It's not any fault of the internet. What does that even
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:52.920]  mean? The internet. It's tubes, groups of tubes. It's not any fault of the
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:56.680]  internet as Rick Perry would call it or Bush would call it. It's the fault. People
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:59.720]  don't know how to use it. No, they went on the site that was meant to data mine
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:03.440]  them and have them waive their rights so the IRS could take their bank accounts.
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:11.360]  And that's what it's for. And that's it. And all you Obama people, he'll be you
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:16.880]  know into the next election, the 2014 election by the time the screw job hits
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:22.200]  you. So until then they're telling you there is no $5,000 tax even though it's
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:27.600]  in the law and they hire the 17,000 agents and it's going forward. Now shifting
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:33.080]  gears to some really exciting news. Dr. Edward Group is our guest. He's one of
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:38.480]  the top supplement developers in the country and he's also a very articulate
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:45.760]  super Uber informed person and I won't go over all of his laurels but he's a
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:49.400]  doctor of chiropractic from Texas Chiropractic College, diplomat of the
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:52.760]  American Clinical Board of Nutrition. It's a nutritionist, diplomat of the
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:55.640]  American Board of Functional Medicine, diplomat of the Chiropractic Board of
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:59.880]  Clinical Nutrition, naturopathic physician, certified clinical
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:03.720]  nutritionist, holistic health practitioner, certified clinical herbalist,
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:08.360]  alternative medical practitioner, works in major hospitals, MD Anderson you name
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.960]  it down in Houston. So he's a prestigious guy and you know my dad's an
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:18.520]  oral surgeon and a dentist and also as one of his degrees in biology and he's
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:22.000]  amazed at how much Group knows because my dad now works with us. He's developed
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.120]  stuff that's been approved by the FDA on the pharmacological side but from herbs.
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.720]  He's come to work with us at m4warslife.com and we will be talking
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:33.880]  about some m4wars life products probably five minutes in the next hour. We're
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:38.000]  going 20 minutes into overdrive. The main reason he's here is because he's so
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.440]  knowledgeable on just a host of issues and so this is the report he wrote up
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:45.840]  for a whole article for us about what he wants to cover today and I'm going to try
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:51.520]  to let him get into it all. Geoengineering, covert bioengineering through the food
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:57.240]  supply which is now admitted, toxins in the air, tobacco smoke, VOCs, mold, mildew,
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:02.120]  dust mites and pet danners, some of the big killers out there and the reason the
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:05.880]  lung problems are going from you know number 10 in the cause of death to
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:09.560]  number 8 now to an even higher level. We're going to get to that in a moment.
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:14.880]  Shocking facts about toxic air. We're going to get into just the whole
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:17.960]  laundry list because I've been talking to them on the phones. They said let's
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:20.560]  just do a show about this. I'm like everybody I know is having respiratory
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:25.120]  problems and I have family dying from it. Two people, my uncle and my cousin and
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:30.960]  we're very healthy. My uncle especially. You know, great health, better shape than
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:38.160]  I was at 68. You know, I'm 40 and people I know that the hospitals are full of
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:41.280]  respiratory problems all over the country and the deaths and it's in the news
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:44.960]  that the drugs aren't working anymore. The big farm of drugs aren't working and
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.400]  so obviously in the middle of that, Weldon Henson, we ought to later in the
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.800]  first 20 minutes of the next hour drag Weldon if he'll do it in here and get
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.120]  him to tell me the story he told me last week. This stuff hides in plain view Dr.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:02.040]  Grip. We're going to skip this network break. Hides in plain view that Weldon's
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:05.040]  like, yeah, I went to the VA, put me on two different things, antibiotics. I couldn't
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:07.680]  get rid of this, you know, this strep in my lungs. That's what it is. Killing
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.040]  everybody. Bacteria. He said, I drank a half bottle of this and you were correcting
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:15.000]  me. I just want to correct this before we get into the whole lung thing. I'm just
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.480]  saying we put on the bottle. Nobody else has a cloyal silver. We did. We put on the
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:24.200]  bottle. Do not use regularly because, you know, it is basically like a, you know,
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:27.920]  metal based antibiotic where they used to put it in the milk jugs for the babies.
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:31.360]  They used to put it in the milk jugs, the pioneers, you know, the silver dollars.
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:34.520]  They put on the baby's stomach when they're born and the old timers just
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:38.440]  knew for thousands of years. Silver is a way to not get infected and die. They
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:41.680]  didn't know what was doing it. They just knew it was doing something. Now you go to
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:46.680]  hospitals. They're using this type of stuff. We got the lab that is the
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:51.720]  strongest in the country and they said this is the, it's the third biggest maker
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:55.160]  in the country that we had private label what I labeled silver bullet, the
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:01.560]  m4slife.com product. And this is the strongest batch they've ever made because
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:07.200]  we made a huge batch. We took a bunch of batches to make it and it is as strong as
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.640]  it gets. We've got all the numbers up on m4slife.com but you were correcting me.
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:17.360]  I mean, obviously if you drink enough cloyal silver with the wrong stuff in it,
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.080]  it could precipitate out a little bit of blue in your nose and things. But you were
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:25.600]  explaining to me that is mass loads of it before that happens. I'm just, obviously
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:28.360]  if you're going to end up dying from it, not having the right antibiotics or being
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:32.720]  sick, anything's good. But silver, we're going to skip this network break network.
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:41.720]  We're going to skip this network break. Thank you. But Dr. Group, explain to me
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:45.920]  cloyal silver and this particular type from m4slife.com. Then I want to get
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:49.160]  into the geoengineering, the bioengineering, the toxins in the air.
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:54.520]  All of it. Well, cloyal silver is an amazing antimicrobial compound. It's been
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:58.760]  used for a long time, like you said. And the difference is really on how you make
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:02.560]  the silver. I mean, if you make it with tap water, let's say, if there's any salts
[02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:06.440]  in the water, you can end up with silver nitrates or silver nitrates. And that's
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:09.760]  the classic blue man that you see that was being interviewed all over the
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:13.640]  media and everything. So it combines what things, it creates like a rust. Yeah, you
[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:19.120]  would have to, if you do silver, right? I mean, I've drank a half a gallon of silver
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:26.000]  done like a 10 parts per million silver for probably 10, 15 days. I mean, this is
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.720]  30 parts per million. Yeah, that's 30 parts per million. So, I mean, now they
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:33.080]  have silver all the way up to 200 parts per million. But really in the studies,
[02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:36.920]  they say that anywhere from 10 to 30 parts per million is going to be a really
[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:42.560]  good amount to take. You know, but how safe is silver? I mean, it's great to use
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:47.200]  on skin as well. Well, I mean, Henson went in the VA and it wasn't helping him
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:50.480]  two different antibiotics and he drank a half bottle this knocked it out. Right.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:54.560]  When I was, when we were seeing patients with all different types of, you know,
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:59.480]  microbial infestations and all different kinds of things, we would use silver
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:04.960]  and have them sometimes drink 16 ounces a day, 16 ounces a day for seven days and
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:07.720]  then back it up. So, but that's under doctor's care. That's under doctor's care,
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:10.120]  though. We're not telling folks to do that. That's under doctor's care. And I mean,
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:15.440]  that's, you know, obviously in a situation you want to get advice from your.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.680]  So, that wasn't even a lot. Well, then drinking half a bottle. What I'm saying is
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:22.480]  it's complete. If it's done correctly, it's completely safe to use. I mean, and
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:27.600]  the guy actually had come out and they've proved that he did that on purpose
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:32.360]  for media attention and he turned himself blue and he produced the silver the wrong
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:37.040]  way and he drank, I think, 32 ounces to 64 ounces of the wrong type of silver
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:41.200]  every single day. There's been a big push against silver, too, for years and
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:44.640]  years and years that trying to, the government trying to shut down anybody
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:48.520]  that's producing silver because they know how effective it is. Man, man with blue
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:54.200]  skin dies in 62. Unlikely, his condition was responsible LA Times. Yeah, I didn't
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:59.280]  even know he died, but it doesn't surprise me. But anyway, it's completely safe to
[02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:03.040]  take. It's one of the things that I highly recommend. I mean, I've had it for
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:06.640]  years. As a matter of fact, the FDA came in my office and rated my office years
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:09.520]  ago and that's one of the things they made me get rid of and they literally
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:13.680]  told me one of the reasons we rated your office is because you're selling and
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:17.640]  promoting colloidal silver. I mean, it was one of the things that was targeted by
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:22.160]  the FDA because it was a threat to the pharmaceutical companies and the threat
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:26.600]  for doctors visits because it worked so good in the body. Well, all I know is
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:30.800]  if the antibiotics stop working, I mean, what am I going to give my kids? I mean,
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:35.040]  right. That's why silver iodine, I mean, iodine is non-resistant. You could take
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:39.080]  any virus, any bacteria, any organism that's harmful to the body and it's
[02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:43.880]  non-resistant to iodine. It's non-resistant to silver, too. At least I've never heard
[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:49.400]  of any organism being resistant, developing resistance to iodine. How
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:55.280]  much colloidal silver do you take? If I get sick, I'll take, I'll drink 16 ounces,
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:58.920]  either eight to 16 ounces a day for at least the first three days. But I tell
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:01.520]  you what else I do. If I have a respiratory problem, that's a 10 parts per
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:05.120]  million. That's a 10 parts per million, yes. At 30 parts per million, then what
[02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:11.440]  would you do? 20 ounces? Probably 10 ounces, 5 ounces. Even 8 ounces, you know.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:14.920]  Another good thing with silvers is safe for children to take, too. I mean, you
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:18.280]  don't want to give, a lot of times they put children on these antibiotics. I mean,
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:21.680]  like what we're going to be talking about today is the respiratory illnesses, the
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:25.880]  fact that respiratory disease and respiratory death has gone from the
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:30.240]  eighth leading cause of death now to the third leading cause of death. Well, I'm
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:33.240]  getting where I'm obsessed with this because it's killing people I know.
[02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:37.800]  Everybody's sick with it. The antibiotics aren't working. Right. Well, because
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:41.080]  they're spraying all the stuff in the air, number one, and then people are living
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:44.960]  in toxic homes and they're working in toxic environments and their immune
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:50.000]  system is already overloaded with all the amount of toxins in the food and the
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.680]  drinks that they're taking. That is just, you're just one breath away from having
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:57.240]  some sort of a respiratory illness. But I was going to tell your listeners also
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:01.640]  that what I did, used to do that works really good, is also you can nebulize
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:05.120]  silver and actually breathe it right into the lungs and it's actually safe to do
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:12.200]  as well. And we have a sponsor, the folks that do that, the silver lungs. We're the
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:15.040]  people that hail it. And of course we have one here at the office and I've got
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:19.040]  one at home, but Rob do just swears by it. Yeah, I mean, right now with what they're
[02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:22.840]  putting in the air and with the, when you look at the aluminum nanoparticles
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:26.240]  that they're aerolizing, all the stuff that's going in the chemtrails now
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:29.480]  they're finding all different types of E. coli, they're finding blood cells in
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:32.280]  there, they're finding all different types of... Yeah, I've seen that in the news
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.240]  where they're finding that and the soil's getting to be heavy aluminum. Yeah,
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:41.120]  listen to this, 200 species, living species right now, are going extinct
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:45.160]  every single day. It's not in the news, nobody knows about it. The only reason I
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:49.000]  know about it is because I work with it since we have an organic farm. We're
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:54.560]  losing trees everywhere, plants are dying everywhere. Oh, I know. 200 species a day.
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:25:00.400]  It's a 100,000% increase since they started geoengineering and weather
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:04.440]  modification and dumping aluminum. And they admit they're doing it, just the
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.680]  details are classified and the general public, people say, hey, sports center's
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:13.840]  on. I'm like, there's a giant secret project spraying us. Right, all over the
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:16.880]  world. I mean, look at the satellite maps, you're seeing all these chemtrails
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:21.720]  being sprayed everywhere. NASA admits the Earth is now, was 20, 30% darker from
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:25.640]  persistent contrails. Well, you'll see one plane that isn't spraying, doesn't
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:29.080]  stay one right by it leaves it. It's being added to the jet fuel. The
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:32.960]  companies don't even know. It's literally being aerosolized out of the jet
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:36.920]  engines. When you take in nanoparticles of aluminum and it was in an aerosol
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:40.680]  state in the air and you breathe it through your nose, it's been studied and
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:45.000]  documented that it goes along the olfactory nerve and it gets deposited in
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  two parts of the brain, the memory part of the brain and the emotional part of
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.760]  the brain. Now, if you take a child whose brain is just, you know, they don't have a
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:56.360]  lot of bones. They don't have a lot of the mucous membrane set up yet and you
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.040]  put high levels of nanoparticles of aluminum and not only that barium and
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.160]  strontium and all the other crap that they're putting in spraying on us. What
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:08.480]  do you think happens to that child? Well, if it goes into the memory part of the
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:13.320]  brain and the emotional part of the brain, it dumps you down and not only that,
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:18.200]  guess what? It goes to the emotional part of the brain, which gives you symptoms
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:25.320]  of ADD, ADHD, autism, depression, anxiety. So they can then diagnose you with the
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:29.880]  psychotropic drugs that they're doing testing now on. And by the way,
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:33.640]  even Time Magazine a month ago came out and admitted that children are
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:37.400]  becoming brain damage and lower IQs and they listed environmental talks and
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:42.320]  chief among them fluoride. They admitted and had the Harvard study in time. How
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:47.520]  did that get out? Well, what happens is, you know, talking about us breathing all
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:50.800]  this stuff in is what you mentioned, all this aluminum and all these particles
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:54.000]  are going on to the ground and killing all the plants because plants have a
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:00.720]  mechanism, especially trees, where they protect their own DNA. So if they sense
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:05.760]  high levels of aluminum in the soil, they will stop sucking up the nutrients. They
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:09.760]  will literally kill themselves because they don't want to damage the whole
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:13.360]  history and the lineage. Now what they're doing is they're blaming all these tree
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:16.640]  deaths on the beetles and all that stuff. Well, of course the beetles are going to
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:20.480]  attack the trees. If the trees have no immune system left, if the trees
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.560]  have an immune system, then they secrete natural compounds from the trees
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:31.040]  to prevent insect damage. But with the spray, with all the GMOs, all the roundup,
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:34.280]  all the other stuff and all the chemicals and the high levels of aluminum in the
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:39.520]  soil, the trees are creating self-death. Well, that's like Oakville all over
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:42.680]  Central Texas killing the beautiful oaks. That Oakville's always been there. It's
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:46.280]  killing everything now. And people out like in Fredericksburg, now all the
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:51.240]  trees are basically dying. But in East Texas, the pine trees are dying. In the
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:55.520]  middle of nowhere and all the farmers are like, the crops don't grow anymore. But
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.600]  don't worry, Monsanto's coming out with aluminum resistant crops. There'll be no
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:04.560]  discussion of why is there more aluminum. No discussion of why is there more
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:08.600]  breast cancer. We'll just try to treatment for breast cancer. We'll find a crop
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.680]  that can grow in aluminum. And all the mercury that's being released into the
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:16.600]  air, the mercury vapors and the mercury that's being coming over here from
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:20.160]  China. That's right. Our power plants don't release the mercury. They're being
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:24.200]  shut down. The jet stream directly from China dumps in over Texas. That's right.
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:27.920]  And when you mix mercury and aluminum together, it causes violent reactions in
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:32.320]  the brain. So, I mean, it's just another reason why that you need to, it's another
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:35.480]  area that you need to look at is respiratory. I mean, allergies are
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:39.040]  through the roof. Asthma is through the roof. My grandmother is from Texas,
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:43.680]  obviously, but lived in Austin. Never had allergies. Has horrible ones now. Well,
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:47.320]  the thing is, you're not supposed to develop allergies when you're 89 years
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:51.280]  old. No, and look at all the kids that have allergies and asthma. I mean, kids are
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:54.800]  dying and people are dying because they're taking their, it's another
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:59.640]  reason why inhalers, they try to put inhalers on you, which have steroids in
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:03.720]  them, which automatically decrease your immune system by 50%. But more people are
[02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:08.400]  dying now because they don't have their inhalers with them. 10-year-old girls,
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:12.440]  13-year-old girls, little kids, they're out in the, you know, at the mall
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:15.880]  somewhere, they forget the inhaler. And no one's asking, why is everybody dying?
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:19.360]  And why has it gone from number eight cause of death to number three? No
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:22.600]  discussion why breast cancer is up multi-thousand percentage points. No
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:26.800]  discussion because they're killing us, folks. They're killing us by design. And
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.840]  then, meanwhile, don't want you to have colloidal silver. And, you know, I'm sorry,
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:35.520]  folks. I'm going to have colloidal silver. I'm going to use it. And we'll see if we
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:37.960]  can drag Weldon in here, but I want to get into your points. You've got this big
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:41.800]  report here. They don't know, you know, they don't want people to know how to
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:44.920]  protect their respiratory system. I want to come back with Dr. Ribba to talk about
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:51.160]  bioengineering, not just geoengineering. We're on the march. The Empire's on the
[02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:57.200]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:04.840]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:09.880]  replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:14.200]  the world. Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride. Ladies and
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:18.840]  gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:24.280]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine. It's the good halogen on the
[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:29.960]  periodic table. And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:34.240]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine. Bottom line,
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:40.400]  iodine is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the
[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:44.880]  answer for myself and my family. You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine

[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:05.240]  message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:10.000]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:15.160]  societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:18.920]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at
[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:24.520]  InfoWarsShop.com. These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:11.920]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:18.800]  network. Again, we've come out with our own proprietary state-of-the-art produce
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:23.040]  one of the best laboratories in the country, Loyal Silver. It's $19, very
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:26.320]  fairly price helps fund the operation. But I'm not here to pitch a bunch of stuff
[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:30.280]  today. We're getting into a lot of key information and it's Silver Bullet
[02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:36.040]  Colloidal Silver, 30 parts per million. And again, we just put warnings on the
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:38.400]  bottle and stuff even though group doesn't think that's necessary just to
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:42.040]  be totally covered because nothing's perfect. But I know it's better than the
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:45.600]  kidney failure people are getting with these new antibiotics. I mean my uncle
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:48.120]  trying to keep him alive. They put him on antibiotics that shut his kidneys off.
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:52.440]  Total kidney failure. With the antibiotics the hospital put him on and the stuff
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:55.440]  they put my dad on to get rid of his pneumonia. And I told my dad take the
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:59.280]  silver, take the silver. He's now doing it and it's working. They said we call
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:04.960]  these kidney tamers. And I know people that have been on multiple regimens and
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:08.480]  it's not helping them. But you've agreed to tell your FDA story because you were
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:12.640]  explaining. I was like during the break I said look I go into CVS and they've got
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:17.240]  silver they're selling now for the mouth and topical and band-aids. I said they
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:20.400]  didn't used to have that. What happened? And you said well no. The FDA tried to
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:24.600]  shut it down in 2002. I remember the push. Try to intimidate people because big
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:29.080]  pharma openly said do this. They failed because I've been in hospitals now
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:31.600]  they're bringing the colloidal silver out. They don't call it that. They call it
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:36.240]  you know silver emulsions and silver IVs. So that's good news that we're
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:40.000]  winning the fight on the silver front because we're running out of antibiotics.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.800]  And I'm not saying antibiotics were always bad. They're obviously overused.
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:48.760]  Recap what you told me. Well what I was telling you is I was one of the biggest
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:53.680]  suppliers of colloidal silver back in the early you know 2019 99 all the way up
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:58.120]  to 2002 whenever they did do that push and my office actually got raided by the
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:01.720]  FDA and I was told that one of the reasons they came in and rated me was
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:06.120]  because of the I was selling colloidal silver. Now I mean we didn't really have
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:10.880]  we didn't have any claims saying this cures this this cures you this don't use
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:14.200]  this instead of an antibiotic or anything. But they just wanted to take away
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:17.680]  everybody out. There's a lot of information. Silver works on a lot of
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:21.000]  other things. I mean eye infections. I mean there's a whole list of things
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.600]  silver's been tested against. You know so I didn't even sell silver and I had to
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:30.800]  take it down and then I didn't even pop it back up until years later. And still
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:34.200]  they come in my the FDA still comes in my office probably once or twice a year
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:38.320]  trying to harass me about different things. And now what I do is I just you
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:41.800]  know at first I used to be scared about it but now I've learned how to deal with
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:46.280]  the FDA and we just immediately go get video cameras. I come take them back and
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:49.440]  sit them in an inner room back in the back let them know they're being filmed
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:53.280]  let them know they're taped and and then just kind of you know ask them a bunch
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:56.520]  of questions why are you here what are we doing wrong state for the camera this
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:01.000]  that and usually they get flustered because they send a you know not a high
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.080]  level FDA personnel out there maybe they'll send too. And they're not as
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:11.760]  apt to you know be so aggressive with me anymore since I kind of take the take
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:15.680]  the first now they're sending them out in uniform though and sometimes people
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:20.280]  with guns yes that's under Obama so they're really mad folks are learning
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:25.160]  about vitamin C, colloidal, silver, herbs, organics they they're trying to shut
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:28.360]  them organic farms. Look at what they've done out in California harassing
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:33.120]  organic co-ops I mean you'd think this stuff was PCP. There's a naval program
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:37.040]  right now where they actually train naval officers in FDA and the naval
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:43.360]  officers are now going out to inspect facilities and issue the military
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:47.880]  military yes totally illegal posse comma tops yes that's what that's what's
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:52.560]  happening right now because we're the enemy yeah we're the enemy but think
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:55.080]  about this I mean you know how many times have we talked about all the
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:58.840]  toxins in the food and the beverages and all that stuff well they know that the
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:03.640]  body has a higher defense mechanism with the enzymes that we naturally
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:07.120]  secrete and the acid in the stomach to try to buffer some of these chemicals
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:12.440]  out but they also know that the fastest way to get something into the body in
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:16.280]  the bloodstream is through you breathing because you take 35,000 breasts every
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:19.760]  single day and the oxygen content on the earth is declining and declining and
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:23.320]  declining and they're doing that on purpose through geoengineering is ripping
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:27.520]  holes in the ozone layer the ozone is just 03 it's completely natural and
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:31.440]  safe it's in the 60s they detonated the Pentagon over a hundred high altitude
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:36.520]  nukes quote this is even in mainline documentaries like Trinity that's
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:40.840]  voiced over and hosted by William Shatner trying to ignite the atmosphere
[02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:45.400]  or blow holes in it that's a great idea let's get rid of the atmosphere it's
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:50.120]  not the CFCs that are the fluorocarbons that are destroying the ozone layers the
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:54.800]  geoengineering and it's the why do they want to do it articles well they
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:58.560]  weather modifications been going started around World War two so they're doing it
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.360]  for multiple reasons they're doing it for weather modification number one so
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:07.440]  they can can you know they can control droughts you know they have the CME the
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:13.120]  Chicago mercantile exchange which they they hedge bets on the on what's going
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:16.760]  to be produced what's not going to be produced as far as derivatives are
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:19.920]  concerned so that that's another money-making scheme which they use
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.520]  geoengineering for population control is the other one because the more people
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.000]  that are sick they know these things are going to go straight into the blood
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  stream they know if you have they know the pharmaceuticals are going to be
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.880]  able to get sell you more asthma allergy medications they know it's going to
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:39.040]  cause psychotic behavior depression anxiety stress they could sell you more
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:42.560]  psychotropic drugs they know you're going to have more problems so it's another
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:47.480]  way to control the population and bring money into the pharmaceutical conglomerate
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:54.120]  and then they want to they want this to work into the agenda 21 situation
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:39:03.040]  because they want people they want to be able to claim this global warming which
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:07.440]  they've been working so hard to do for all these years you know even though it's
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:11.200]  backfiring on them I mean they want to and they're even using this polar
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:15.000]  vortex scenarios and everything and they're using these ice nucleations and
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:18.480]  these chemtrails right now where they can actually create snow at 60 degrees
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:22.520]  that's why you're seeing 80 degree weather and then two days like in
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.120]  Atlanta was 80 degrees and two days later it's snowing because they can use
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:30.160]  these ice nucleation techniques in the in the can by the way in the United Arab
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:32.960]  Emirates and and all over they admit they've got all this they're publicly
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:38.240]  doing it right here they go oh nothing's going on yeah here and here's another
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:45.120]  thing that's happening I mean all the pilots and the I have so many airline
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:48.160]  people that work for the airline stewardesses and stuff like that that
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:51.040]  are called my office all the time and they're chronically sick as a matter of
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:55.400]  fact there's one airline that contacted me that wanted me to help their employees
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:00.200]  because they're in a major airline major airline they probably the biggest they
[02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:04.280]  probably one of the biggest ones and their liability their medical insurance
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:08.840]  expenses were in two years went from like 200 and something million all the
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:13.520]  way up to 800 million because all the airline personnel are getting sick
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:17.240]  well we found out that you know what happens when you're flying and even
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:20.360]  per even people that are frequent fliers are having the same problems
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:26.440]  respiratory illnesses and stuff because 50% of that air that they take in that
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:31.440]  they put inside the cabin comes from outside air so if you're taking in all
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:34.760]  the aluminum particles and they're actually found phthalates which are
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:38.520]  endocrine disruptors to in chemtrails right now and the stroetium and the
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:43.240]  barium and all these different disruptors guess what if you fly you're
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:47.720]  breathing that stuff in those aluminum nanoparticles as you fly and all the
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:51.960]  staff and the airline pilots now are coming down ill and they're coming down
[02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:55.760]  with psychological disorders and by the way this isn't your opinion no
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:01.080]  respiratory deaths from number eight to number third cause of death cancers in
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:05.440]  children are up 10,000 percent people can pull this up diabetes 3,000 percent
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:13.000]  type 2 suddenly the hospitals are full of people that quote get sick children and
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.320]  get type 1 and my dad was saying it's really a viral pancreatitis that a lot
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:24.360]  of times the the the pancreas comes back but Dell Children's Center when my
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:30.360]  buddy's daughter got sick three years old took her in it was full the nurse
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:33.240]  said we've never been this full they're all coming down with type 1 they go
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:39.960]  it's genetic it's but the virus triggers it what's going on there because no one's
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:45.720]  making an issue about diabetes being connected to viruses attacking the
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:48.920]  pancreas and they don't even want you to know that it usually comes back my dad
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:51.880]  was saying he was showing me medical literature online this has been well
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:56.720]  known for 50 years they just go no go on the insulin now which then shuts down
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:02.440]  the pancreas it's diabolical but the but the doctors just do it they just do
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.280]  it it's like a long time ago in order to diagnose somebody with high cholesterol
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:09.680]  you had to take a blood reading one month take one the next month take one the
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:12.840]  next month and average them all together over a three-month period of time and
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:16.760]  then you would come up with a cholesterol level which normal cholesterol
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:24.400]  used to be 200 plus your 200 plus your age could be a normal cholesterol level
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:28.320]  but now they've keeps lowering the level of cholesterol and they put you on
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.520]  cholesterol medications after one reading one blood reading of high
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:37.120]  cholesterol but to get to your point yes because nobody had none of the doctors
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:40.720]  addressed the root cause of the problem and they don't look in the right areas
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:43.640]  because all the pharmaceutical companies come in there and say okay if you have
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:47.040]  this number on your blood work prescribed this if you have this prescribed
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:52.440]  this so but what we have is just disease we have a lowered immune system in
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:58.760]  everybody because if you if you have a strong immune system and your pH levels
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:02.760]  in your body are correct disease can't manifest in your system you know your
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:06.240]  body's own immune system will attack those viruses will attack that extra
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:10.160]  bacteria and all that but when you get overloaded with all those bacteria is the
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:15.840]  fungus which is another big huge problem right now everybody has yeast and
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:19.320]  fungus and bacteria and microbes in their system that needs to be addressed
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:23.760]  and it goes back to the old saying you know you need to detoxify your body on
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:27.000]  a regular basis that's right let me expand on this my grandmother again
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.320]  who's in pretty good health for a nine years old still cognitively they're
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:37.360]  sharp you name it my only grandparents alive she went into her doctor at the
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.080]  hospital she goes to see one that you know at a hospital and he sends her over
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:47.240]  for test and she says oh I forgot an eight sugar today I can't do the diabetes
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:51.640]  test she's never had diabetes has good you know blood levels the test comes out
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:55.000]  and shows high sugar even though she wasn't supposed to have had any sugar
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.560]  when she took the sugar you know that test for the name of it my dad described
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:02.400]  it all to me he got real mad about even wrote an article for the website about
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:09.000]  it and he went and found out about it and they gave her a diabetes medication
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.400]  that day super high-powered pill where it put her almost into a coma for like a
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:16.400]  day because it knocked her blood sugar down to absolutely nothing and she
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:19.960]  couldn't even basically talk my dad reverse engineered the whole deal and
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:23.440]  went and looked at the law the regulations everything and said you're
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:28.640]  not supposed to do that until you've done other tests multiple times it puts
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:32.840]  them on diabetes medication because it can shut their pancreas down and he
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:35.800]  went to show them the literature you're supposed to do this test where they
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:39.800]  slice up the red blood cells for a month you know they take a blood draw it'll
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:42.800]  have a month of blood cells in it that's along a blood cell last for it's cut
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:47.040]  into platelets they cut them up and then they get the average of it he told me
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:49.520]  the name of the test he wrote an article about it again for m4s.com for
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:55.160]  folks that want technicals I forget the exact name of it but the point is is that
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:01.080]  he went and had that done and she had actually low blood sugar and he seriously
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:04.800]  thinking about suing the doctor but the doctor's defense was we go off these
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:13.240]  computers now and and the national you know system and Obamacare we go off that
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:18.000]  system now and it tells us do this and my dad said you might as well just shoot
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:23.040]  old ladies in the head she doesn't have diabetes she doesn't have type 1 she
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:29.520]  doesn't have type 2 they literally knew that she'd eaten and shouldn't do the
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:34.800]  test they literally still did it and then put her on something that almost
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:39.880]  killed her that's America now dr. group that's how crazy it is when you go to
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:44.320]  these hospitals that's that's the reason why medical mistakes are the number one
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:47.280]  leading cause of death and they've been the number one leading cause of death
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:52.880]  but this wasn't even a mistake big pharma big pharma they would classify it as a
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:56.400]  mistake but I mean no that that was not a mistake at all I mean I was in a
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:02.480]  clinic picking up some medications a clinic built on to a pharmacy that also
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:05.520]  has natural supplements that itself's picking some stuff up for family and I
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:11.080]  saw this woman that looked like you know a beauty queen in a short skirt and the
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:16.240]  glasses on and I said who is that and they said oh that's the drug reps they're
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.200]  in here all the time and then they went on to tell me because the guy knew me he
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:24.160]  goes listen I'll let you in on the big secret they can't really give us trips
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:31.440]  and goods and Rolexes anymore but if you buy their drugs you get a date they
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:38.840]  what big pharma basically has hookers now out as their reps can you believe
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:42.720]  that yeah I can believe that for sure I mean this is this is this not
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:48.560]  diabolical it is it is but I mean it's just like it's you know in fact I came
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:55.840]  out the news guys search sales companies using women's sex to sell or sales
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:47:00.200]  women using sex to sell go ahead I'm sorry no I mean I I don't see you know
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:03.680]  why they wouldn't do that I mean they pull out every every string that they
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:08.320]  have but when you look at the mechanism of causing disease I mean not only is it
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:12.040]  the chemtrails that were for the respiratory because they know how how
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.280]  powerful that respiratory tract admission is I mean they know that you're
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:18.200]  going to breathe it in it's going to come right into your system but then you
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:21.880]  got all the other chemicals to I mean the smoking I mean now they have the
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:25.560]  e-cigarettes which they put the propylene glycol in which is just anti-free so
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:29.440]  when you combine let's say what you're breathing in from chemtrails then you
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:33.400]  combine all the household chemicals the mold the mildew the dust mites the
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:38.320]  dander all the chemicals and heavy metals you're exposed to the paint fumes
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:42.600]  most people live in an extremely toxic house because everything is built green
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:47.360]  now and everything is so come you know airtight that there's the inside air is
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:50.920]  10 times worse than the outside air so when you're sitting in there if you're
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:55.600]  sleeping on a memory foam mattress where you're breathing in fire retardants and
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:59.840]  VOC's and in all this outgassing all day long with your toxic chemicals the
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.200]  phthalates you see you have smoke you have mold and mildew you have pet dander
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:08.720]  you know all this stuff combined is going into your bloodstream and all it's
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.840]  doing is just reducing your immune system even more and you know what I found
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:18.720]  is that oh look at it there it is give me an RX cheerleaders pep up drug sales I
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:23.680]  was saying I'm not saying she's a hooker that's a New York Times article she
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.720]  became a drug salesperson but but I'm telling you I've seen articles where some
[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:34.120]  of the women anyways I'm sorry because they know that sex sells I mean you
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:38.160]  know and they have to it's a game what they have to they want to get in there
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:42.120]  and sell that their drugs to the SOP so the doctors will prescribe more of them
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:45.720]  they it's a money game I mean they want to make more money so of course they're
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:50.960]  gonna do whatever they want to do but what I'm what I want people to understand
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:56.160]  is that there's ways to clean up your lungs and you have to protect your lungs
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.840]  here it is TBS news which are you Pfizer sales reps discuss having sex with
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:08.120]  doctors I told you literally though dude I mean I know like you know number 10
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:13.560]  street walkers when I see them I mean this country is unbelievable man it is
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:20.200]  unbelievable I mean it's we have we have people that are sick that are dying
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:25.960]  every single day because and we've got beautiful women selling Ritalin making
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:29.600]  sure the doctors put the kids on Adderall that's I mean how do you stop a
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:33.440]  woman that looks like Marilyn Monroe to have him the doctor want to meet that
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:38.880]  quota yeah and then if I mean literally that's like how the the the the the
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:41.840]  Nazis you know had both the Kennedy brothers having sex with his blonde
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:46.360]  bombshell Nazi operative that got declassified in World War two they had
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:49.960]  to actually send them overseas to get them away from her I mean that the drug
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:55.240]  reps are literally using sex operatives how do you deal with that kind of power
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:50:00.760]  but they got the FDA coming after us it doesn't stop there because it also you
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:04.600]  know look if you send out a bunch of prostitutes to sell your drugs and you

[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:19.840]  father then they go through a divorce what happens then they both get
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:23.000]  stressed out they could put it put on psychotrophic drugs it's not just one

[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:43.600]  empty as my conscience by the way I mean I remember hearing this and I'd
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:46.400]  forgotten I'd even seen news articles years ago but when you see it for
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:51.160]  yourself the drug reps now I've been told are almost all super hot women and
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:56.680]  then the down and dirty is is that a large percentage of them end up with
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:00.200]  the doctors that do the best oh there's a little there's some dates on the side
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:06.800]  and again ladies and gentlemen that that is so criminal to be doing that and
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:11.120]  it's just like the police are also taking sex for favors but here's the CBS
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:17.400]  news Pfizer sales reps discuss having sex with doctors sales reps at Pfizer are
[02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:21.920]  using a cafe farmer bulletin board to discuss whether it is common for their
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:25.080]  colleagues to sleep with doctors when they are trying to persuade to write
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:31.480]  prescriptions and it goes on to say they brag about it but I'm telling you the
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:35.120]  companies are doing it on purpose it's organized and they have articles oh it's
