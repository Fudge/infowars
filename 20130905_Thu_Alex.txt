[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:26.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.880 --> 00:31.680]  My friends, a few weeks ago, I told you that I believed history was in the making.
[00:31.680 --> 00:38.840]  A total collapse, a route in confidence that the people have in the ruling establishment
[00:38.840 --> 00:43.400]  of kleptocratic control freak monopoly men.
[00:43.400 --> 00:48.360]  And that is indeed happening right now, in fact, even more accelerated than I said it
[00:48.360 --> 00:50.120]  perhaps could be.
[00:50.120 --> 00:54.880]  Just a few days ago, it was 50-50 if the House of Representatives would vote to authorize
[00:54.880 --> 00:55.880]  the war.
[00:55.880 --> 00:59.000]  I have multiple political break-downs here.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.640]  It looks like it's going to be an absolute route that Obama won't lose the vote by 20
[01:04.640 --> 01:06.720]  votes, as they were saying yesterday.
[01:06.720 --> 01:08.200]  It may be 50.
[01:08.200 --> 01:18.360]  It may be 100 bipartisan coming together against the madness of fighting on the side of Al-Qaeda
[01:18.360 --> 01:25.440]  and Jihadi rebels who were blowing up churches and beheading Christian Orthodox priests.
[01:25.440 --> 01:31.920]  And now, finally, the mainstream media is showing soldier executions from months ago,
[01:31.920 --> 01:39.000]  going, well, it is soldiers, and oh, it's only one warlord.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.440]  Instead of showing the churches being blown up, the children being killed, the people
[01:42.440 --> 01:45.720]  being forced to be suicide bombers, they're trying to address it because they've acted
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.200]  like it hasn't been going on, and they know the alternative media and the real press has
[01:50.200 --> 01:51.760]  been covering it.
[01:51.760 --> 01:55.520]  And you have got all these Democrats coming out now saying we shouldn't be on the side
[01:55.520 --> 01:56.520]  of Al-Qaeda.
[01:56.520 --> 01:57.520]  Not just Republicans.
[01:57.520 --> 02:02.600]  You've got Lloyd Doggett in Texas, literally an Obama minion coming out against it.
[02:02.600 --> 02:09.440]  You've got Pelosi saying she doesn't know if there's the votes in the House.
[02:09.440 --> 02:10.960]  This is a big deal.
[02:10.960 --> 02:16.520]  Now, Obama says he's going to go ahead with it anyways.
[02:16.520 --> 02:22.360]  Now, you notice they said this Saturday, in fact, we need to put a compilation of these
[02:22.360 --> 02:23.640]  lives together.
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.560]  Last year, in August, saying red line, any chemical use.
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.080]  Now, yesterday, saying he never said that.
[02:31.080 --> 02:36.960]  Last Saturday, saying there will never be any boots on the ground, tailored, specific,
[02:36.960 --> 02:37.960]  surgical.
[02:37.960 --> 02:46.040]  Now, it's, of course, we've got to have boots on the ground, unbelievable.
[02:46.040 --> 02:53.400]  And there is now just a route of this president, but here is the $64 trillion question.
[02:53.400 --> 02:58.200]  Will they allow the complete implosion of Obama and the globalist agenda?
[02:58.200 --> 03:01.640]  Because this big loss of confidence in the establishment is going to affect Republican
[03:01.640 --> 03:03.800]  establishment as well.
[03:03.800 --> 03:11.920]  The Republican blue bloods have circled the wagons, disgustingly, around Obama.
[03:11.920 --> 03:15.440]  But you've also got even people like Mitch McConnell saying he doesn't know if he'll support
[03:15.440 --> 03:18.000]  it, who is definitely an insider.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.280]  So this is unbelievable.
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.960]  This is beyond Nixonian collapse.
[03:24.960 --> 03:32.120]  And I'm telling you right now, we better be wargaming this collectively on the radio
[03:32.120 --> 03:39.120]  together, listeners, other pundits, other smart people out there.
[03:39.120 --> 03:42.440]  I'd like to see what Drudge, who always seems to have the finger out on the pulse, what
[03:42.440 --> 03:43.800]  does Drudge think they're going to pull?
[03:43.800 --> 03:46.320]  Maybe his Twitter, maybe he'll tell us.
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.600]  I need to come to understanding myself, got a lot of ideas, and put it out on my Twitter
[03:52.600 --> 03:59.280]  at RealAlex Jones, and do articles about it, and move one step ahead of, okay, total collapse
[03:59.280 --> 04:01.240]  and confidence for these criminals.
[04:01.240 --> 04:03.960]  That's a really positive thing.
[04:03.960 --> 04:07.040]  Little man behind the curtain, Toto pulls the curtain back.
[04:07.040 --> 04:08.040]  That's now happened.
[04:08.040 --> 04:14.480]  Now, they're standing there butt naked with their hand in the cookie jar, pants down around
[04:14.480 --> 04:17.920]  their ankles, caught doing the deed.
[04:17.920 --> 04:20.720]  The question is, what are they going to do now?
[04:20.720 --> 04:24.800]  Because it's not like you just pull the curtain back and, you know, there's Jeffrey Dahmer,
[04:24.800 --> 04:30.400]  Barack Obama, New World Order, you know, John McCain, these sicko, lying, freak, corrupt
[04:30.400 --> 04:32.320]  bastards.
[04:32.320 --> 04:34.920]  Now the curtain has literally fallen.
[04:34.920 --> 04:45.320]  I mean, this morning I was jogging, and I had to actually stop and actually sit down.
[04:45.320 --> 04:51.600]  Because it was hitting me that history is happening, and I'm not even responding to it correctly.
[04:51.600 --> 04:54.920]  I mean, this is the time that tries men's souls.
[04:54.920 --> 04:56.400]  This is the best of times.
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.760]  This is the worst of times.

[08:00.480 --> 08:19.160]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[08:19.160 --> 08:25.160]  We have communicated in no uncertain terms with every player in the region that that's
[08:25.160 --> 08:26.960]  a red line for us.
[08:26.960 --> 08:29.360]  I didn't set a red line.
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.680]  The world set a red line.
[08:33.680 --> 08:38.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have just a lot of trouble dealing with the level of lying I'm
[08:38.800 --> 08:39.800]  saying.
[08:39.800 --> 08:46.320]  What Obama said on Saturday that there would be no boots on the ground when there's already
[08:46.320 --> 08:51.840]  boots on the ground for two and a half years, Western commandos and contractors, lazing
[08:51.840 --> 09:01.920]  targets and basically giving insight and tutelage to the al-Qaeda forces that have started the
[09:01.920 --> 09:11.320]  war with Syriam and then they have the nerve to call the rebels activist and protesters.
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.640]  The activists and protesters blew up some more churches yesterday and shelled Christian
[09:15.640 --> 09:22.680]  villages and chopped off more Christians' heads and what is it, over two million people
[09:22.680 --> 09:30.680]  fled Syria already the last year, that's AP numbers, mainly Christians and Muslim minorities
[09:30.680 --> 09:34.800]  knowing that the jihadis are going to chop their heads off.
[09:34.800 --> 09:40.920]  And then we get to have Obama up there saying we will share in the moral responsibility
[09:40.920 --> 09:46.360]  for anyone who's hurt in this crisis when they're the ones that started it and then
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.760]  the Secretary of State Kerry, Rubberface or whatever you want to call him, Frankenstein,
[09:52.760 --> 10:00.360]  he gets up there and says, well he said quote, anyone against this intervention will be responsible
[10:00.360 --> 10:07.200]  for further atrocities when they are the authors of the entire thing that's happened
[10:07.200 --> 10:11.440]  over there, the disaster.
[10:11.440 --> 10:18.000]  Now you heard Obama on Saturday, we played the clip on Monday, I shot a video about it
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.520]  on Saturday where he said there will be no boots on the ground, this will be limited
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.160]  and surgical, now they're saying, oh the resolution is unlimited, we can attack anybody in the
[10:28.160 --> 10:34.280]  world we want, we need 75,000 troops on the ground, the Pentagon comes out and says we
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.320]  were told to have 75,000 troops ready, what do you think they have amphibious Marine Corps
[10:39.320 --> 10:47.080]  groups off the coast for, they have amphibious delivery ships, the big ships that just gorge
[10:47.080 --> 10:53.640]  the amphibious landing craft, the propeller driven, the hovercraft all of it, the attack
[10:53.640 --> 10:59.600]  helicopters, the tanks, the armored vehicles, they're all waiting with now six missile cruisers
[10:59.600 --> 11:05.920]  and aircraft carriers arriving all there, of course they plan to invade the place, you
[11:05.920 --> 11:11.520]  hear Kerry go, well if the country implodes, then we don't want that to happen of course
[11:11.520 --> 11:14.800]  we're only trying as hard as we can, but if it implodes because the plan is to break it
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.360]  in three parts at least, well two they'll take the three, three is their goal.
[11:20.360 --> 11:24.480]  And the Council on Foreign Relations puts out the battle plan, Wesley Clarks talked about
[11:24.480 --> 11:30.080]  it repeatedly, this is all on record for over a decade, the plan for Syria, and then they
[11:30.080 --> 11:38.680]  sit there acting like oh Jeepers, Creepers, Jimity Crickets, Alice, you know we are really
[11:38.680 --> 11:44.440]  concerned about the children and the nerve gas and we reported on this back in March,
[11:44.440 --> 11:53.860]  we reported on it yesterday, it's now McClatchy News today, Russia says it's compiled a 100
[11:53.860 --> 12:03.680]  page report blaming Syrian rebels for chemical weapons attack, ladies and gentlemen, this
[12:03.680 --> 12:12.920]  is what we're dealing with, this article right here from McClatchy, Russia says it has compiled
[12:12.920 --> 12:18.800]  a 100 page report blaming Syrian rebels for chemical weapons attack, Russia says it has
[12:18.800 --> 12:22.560]  compiled a 100 page report detailing what it says is evidence that Syrian rebels not
[12:22.560 --> 12:32.000]  forces loyal to President Bashar Assad were behind a deadly sarin gas in the suburb of
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.760]  Aleppo earlier this year, yeah that's the big one we've been reporting on.
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.880]  In a statement posted on the Russian Foreign Ministry website Wednesday, yes we covered
[12:42.880 --> 12:48.360]  it yesterday, Russia said the report had been delivered to the United States in July, yes
[12:48.360 --> 12:54.080]  we covered it then as well and includes detailed scientific analysis of samples that Russian
[12:54.080 --> 13:01.120]  technicians collected at the site of the alleged attack, well folks the Turks caught them last
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.280]  year and this year with nerve gas sneaking back and forth across the border, the Al Qaeda
[13:05.280 --> 13:13.880]  forces, so there's that, Russia warns of nuclear disaster in Syria if it is attacked and admit
[13:13.880 --> 13:22.320]  what the Israelis have said for a long time, Russian designed and built many research reactors,
[13:22.320 --> 13:26.800]  at least one, there are a lot of these research reactors folks, they've got two in Austin,
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.880]  Texas, just to give you, we're supposedly not on the map of nuclear sites, we have two
[13:30.880 --> 13:36.240]  of the things, one at the pickle center and one under the UT tower, by the way that's
[13:36.240 --> 13:46.480]  leaking according to my information, whatever it's good for you, Ann Coulter said, if a warhead
[13:46.480 --> 13:52.560]  by designer by chance were to hit the miniature neutron source reactor near Damascus the consequences
[13:52.560 --> 13:58.880]  could be catastrophic, Russian Foreign Minister Spokesman Alexander Lukashev stated according
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.480]  to Russia today, so there you go, that's CBS News reporting on that, brutality of Syrian
[14:04.480 --> 14:11.600]  rebels posing dilemma in the West, the New York Times says, and they're finally showing
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.640]  videos that we have up on info wars.com of soldiers being shot, soldiers being beheaded,
[14:17.640 --> 14:24.480]  but that's nothing folks, they're throwing kids off roofs, beheading a priest, a Christian
[14:24.480 --> 14:31.360]  priest, it just goes on and on, by the way I tweeted last night at real Alex Jones
[14:31.360 --> 14:38.600]  at Breitbart story, where they were shelling from a monastery, a Christian village, and
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.360]  burning it to the ground, and there's videos and photos of this, and I saw on Twitter Obama's
[14:43.360 --> 14:51.280]  supporters, I followed back to their Twitter sites last night, they were all big Democrats,
[14:51.280 --> 14:57.600]  and they said, aha, Breitbart, you mean BS, you right wingers, you're scum, you can go
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.040]  read the tweet telling me that I'm a big liar and stuff, but I'm just a liberty lover, as
[15:02.040 --> 15:04.760]  I've always said, it's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong, it's about
[15:04.760 --> 15:12.560]  freedom versus tyranny, it's about libertarian versus authoritarian, and I go to these Democrats,
[15:12.560 --> 15:22.560]  Twitter sites, and they're on my site saying I'm wrong, nobody's killing Christians, me
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.840]  of people are just scum, all because it's Obama, like these Democratic Congress people,
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.680]  they're saying they're gonna vote for the war in loyalty to Obama, that's like you're
[15:32.680 --> 15:37.840]  gonna line people up and shoot them in concentration camps in loyalty to Hitler, and then they
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.520]  made fun of me on there, and again, I don't mind being made fun of, you don't freak me
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.920]  out the way you think you do, calling me a redneck, calling me a racist, all this stuff
[15:47.920 --> 15:54.160]  like they're doing on my Twitter feed, it freaks me out that you're so bad, and you're
[15:54.160 --> 16:02.400]  so dumbed down, and you're so unreachable, that you're so lost that you'll do anything
[16:02.400 --> 16:07.440]  for Obama, as we pointed out in Austin, Texas, and in Los Angeles with our man on the street
[16:07.440 --> 16:13.280]  interviews, you nine out of ten Austinites in trendy areas, if you say we're gonna take
[16:13.280 --> 16:16.920]  all the guns and put gun owners in FEMA camps, nine out of ten, sign it, if you say we're
[16:16.920 --> 16:22.680]  gonna kill babies at age three for Obama, people sign it, if you say we're going to
[16:22.680 --> 16:27.000]  set up checkpoints and we're gonna search everybody's homes without warrants for Obama,
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.560]  nine out of ten, sign it, we're gonna ban water for the environment, Obama said they
[16:31.560 --> 16:38.400]  sign it, and they just sit there calling me racist because I'm against murdering a bunch
[16:38.400 --> 16:43.800]  of innocent Syrians, I don't even, it's, but I understand it, you're unelectual, dumbed
[16:43.800 --> 16:50.520]  down, buffoons, and that's your intellectual response, is to call me a redneck, call me
[16:50.520 --> 16:57.840]  a racist, call me stupid, say I'm full of baloney because you intellectually can't come
[16:57.840 --> 17:05.280]  to grips with what's going on, and you know what, you are getting to me, but not in the
[17:05.280 --> 17:09.520]  way you think, I'm really sad that you're so pathetic, and I'm really worried about
[17:09.520 --> 17:12.360]  this country and our whole future, now let me give you the good news before I get back
[17:12.360 --> 17:17.640]  into the incredible Syria developments, this is a total collapse of the establishment,
[17:17.640 --> 17:20.760]  the bad news is they're gonna try to strike back, and I'm gonna open the phones up today
[17:20.760 --> 17:25.200]  and get your take on, if you agree with me on that, and what do you think that staged
[17:25.200 --> 17:26.200]  event will be?
[17:26.200 --> 17:29.960]  They're gonna try to change the subject now, because they tried to change the subject from
[17:29.960 --> 17:35.520]  the seven scandals with this new Syria thing, but that didn't work, so they're gonna try
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.320]  to change the subject, and it's gonna have to be big, because there's a total sea change,
[17:40.320 --> 17:46.640]  a turning of the lake, a flipping here, a flash point, I mean, you're living history
[17:46.640 --> 17:50.600]  right now, and by the way, I was the first to say it two weeks ago, not bragging, I
[17:50.600 --> 17:56.640]  can feel it in my gut and see it politically, but in my gut, it's just unbelievable, okay,
[17:56.640 --> 18:00.240]  now you see everybody else saying it, because it's happening, okay, it's happening right
[18:00.240 --> 18:06.080]  now, but let me tell you something, I think I'm gonna start staying up here about 17 hours
[18:06.080 --> 18:11.960]  today actually, until this is all played out, because this is like war room stuff, I'm telling
[18:11.960 --> 18:19.200]  you right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're going to pull something very, very soon, guarantee,
[18:19.200 --> 18:23.000]  and it may be a new big chemical attack or something, it may be, they'll have rebel
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.400]  forces fire missiles out of Syria into Israel, with medium range, anybody ever think about
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.400]  that?
[18:30.400 --> 18:34.000]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff going on right now, and believe me, they've got
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.120]  a bunch of plans laid out at the White House, and at the National Security Council, right
[18:39.120 --> 18:44.000]  now, and the heavy hitters are deciding which button to push, they're gonna push one of
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.600]  the buttons, unless we get the word out about false flag, like our lives depend on it, but
[18:49.600 --> 18:56.360]  here's the deal, I don't think this new staged event is going to work either, but they may
[18:56.360 --> 19:01.040]  not care, they may just move ahead, and use the emergency alert system to take over the
[19:01.040 --> 19:05.720]  media, to shut down talk radio, they may start staging domestic stuff, they may blow stuff
[19:05.720 --> 19:10.480]  up and say the patriot movement, they may try to assassinate Obama in some staged event
[19:10.480 --> 19:11.480]  with some patsy.
[19:11.480 --> 19:16.520]  I mean, let me tell you, I can literally tell you what's going on in the White House, historically
[19:16.520 --> 19:19.240]  by studying the criminology of these people.
[19:19.240 --> 19:26.280]  They are in meetings right now while Obama is at the G20 in St. Petersburg.
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.600]  The heads of the National Security Council are in there right now with their psych warfare
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.400]  chiefs, and they've got probably 20 different plans on the table, looking at which ones
[19:34.400 --> 19:35.400]  they're gonna play.
[19:35.400 --> 19:40.200]  They've got the cards in their hand, and they're looking at what they're gonna play, because
[19:40.200 --> 19:43.240]  their whole house of cards is coming down, let me tell you why.
[19:43.240 --> 19:48.480]  It's now safe to talk about the NSA, the New World Order, the secret arrest, the torture,
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.920]  the checkpoints, everybody's starting to speak out, so it makes it safe for everybody.
[19:52.920 --> 19:59.800]  The NRA suing the NSA for creating a secret gun registry, folks, it's on, it's on!

[22:56.920 --> 23:00.000]  Better prepared than scared.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.400]  Is hurricane and wildfire season again?
[23:02.400 --> 23:07.360]  My two thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their
[23:07.360 --> 23:10.120]  lives that the disaster won't get them.
[23:10.120 --> 23:15.080]  Hundreds of you helped E-Foods Direct ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[23:15.080 --> 23:17.240]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[23:17.240 --> 23:21.840]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take
[23:21.840 --> 23:23.680]  care of those who really can't.
[23:23.680 --> 23:28.400]  The new Justin Case Pack from E-Foods Direct is the big brother to the seven-day emergency
[23:28.400 --> 23:31.880]  pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[23:31.880 --> 23:36.480]  It contains a two-month supply for one person, or a one-month supply for two adults, or a
[23:36.480 --> 23:38.840]  two-week supply for a family of four.
[23:38.840 --> 23:42.920]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[23:52.320 --> 24:10.360]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, e-foodsdirect.com, slash Alex.
[24:10.360 --> 24:14.640]  All right, let me try to break this down clearly.
[24:14.640 --> 24:18.640]  I know most of you understand this probably better than I do.
[24:18.640 --> 24:27.320]  Historically, tyrannies look invincible, and they tell everybody, oh, there's no depression,
[24:27.320 --> 24:32.960]  oh, this isn't a war, oh, our dear leader is infallible, oh, no one will ever defeat
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.680]  them, the elite is invincible.
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.840]  Until finally, people underground criticize the system, point out its lies, point out
[24:42.840 --> 24:43.920]  its fraud.
[24:43.920 --> 24:49.360]  We've always got maybe 30%, 40% of the population that'll go with the establishment view because
[24:49.360 --> 24:55.760]  they are so dumbed down and cowardly and don't respect themselves, so they feel powerful
[24:55.760 --> 24:58.440]  when they go with the establishment.
[24:58.440 --> 25:04.000]  But finally, when they see the mass of the public wake up, they will then join with the
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.200]  public as well.
[25:06.200 --> 25:12.280]  And so suddenly, you will have the vast majority of people turning against the system and believing
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.800]  nothing it says.
[25:16.800 --> 25:23.920]  And generally, historically, propagandists that run the systems, if you study Joseph
[25:23.920 --> 25:28.720]  Goebbels and others, they will actually intensify the line.
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.360]  So I never said there was a red line, even though he gave a press conference saying,
[25:33.360 --> 25:37.640]  America, and I have set specific red lines that we've told everybody in the region and
[25:37.640 --> 25:38.640]  our allies.
[25:38.640 --> 25:39.640]  This is it.
[25:39.640 --> 25:40.640]  It's in stone.
[25:40.640 --> 25:42.640]  Across it, it's on.
[25:42.640 --> 25:45.040]  One year later, I never said that.
[25:45.040 --> 25:49.160]  How dare you say I said that?
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.360]  Five days ago, Saturday, we will never have boots on the ground.
[25:53.360 --> 25:55.720]  You have my firm pledge.
[25:55.720 --> 26:07.600]  Four days later, yesterday, of course, we need boots on the ground, 75,000 ribs.
[26:07.600 --> 26:13.200]  But now coming out that Obamacare is not going to just double, but in many states, triple
[26:13.200 --> 26:15.200]  your premium.
[26:15.200 --> 26:18.960]  There is no free health care.
[26:18.960 --> 26:20.880]  There was free health care under charity before.
[26:20.880 --> 26:21.880]  It's all gone.
[26:21.880 --> 26:23.680]  It's going to be gone now.
[26:23.680 --> 26:25.800]  The free health care will now be gone.
[26:25.800 --> 26:27.120]  You will now not get the surgery.
[26:27.120 --> 26:28.480]  You'll get a cane for your knee.
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.480]  You will not get eye surgery.
[26:29.480 --> 26:30.480]  You'll get a cane again.
[26:30.480 --> 26:31.480]  It's all on record.
[26:31.480 --> 26:36.240]  You're going to lose everything, written by foreign banks, everything.
[26:36.240 --> 26:43.800]  New story out, up on infowars.com, up on dredgerport.com, the examiner out of Washington, warning
[26:43.800 --> 26:48.920]  DC cops under orders to arrest tourists with empty bullet casings.
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.600]  People wear empty bullet casings around their necks or they have them on their key chain
[26:52.600 --> 26:53.600]  or whatever.
[26:53.600 --> 26:56.040]  You're going to jail and the police have been ordered.
[26:56.040 --> 26:58.320]  You be on the lookout for tourists that don't know.
[26:58.320 --> 27:02.240]  We want to fill our jails with the scum Americans.
[27:02.240 --> 27:06.600]  Let me tell you, when you're in DC, the cops go out of their way and I videotaped this
[27:06.600 --> 27:08.680]  and put the videos out there on YouTube.
[27:08.680 --> 27:10.760]  They'll see a little kid with a camera.
[27:10.760 --> 27:13.960]  They'll walk over and say, you know you're not allowed to have that.
[27:13.960 --> 27:16.440]  Start screaming at the parents because they've been given orders.
[27:16.440 --> 27:18.960]  You let the public know they're scum.
[27:18.960 --> 27:22.960]  It came out in the Washington Times about six years ago that people that parked their
[27:22.960 --> 27:27.960]  cars legally, police and tow trucks that off duty own the tow truck companies.
[27:27.960 --> 27:29.040]  They're just mafia.
[27:29.040 --> 27:35.200]  They pull up in uniform and we're taking cars in one case when the news caught them at McDonald's
[27:35.200 --> 27:41.400]  legally parked going in to eat the GMO stuff and you come out and the cops and the purses
[27:41.400 --> 27:42.400]  are, what are you doing?
[27:42.400 --> 27:44.280]  And the cops get out and put a gun to your head.
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.480]  They're nothing but bandits folks and they're going to rule this country.
[27:48.480 --> 27:49.480]  It's theirs now.
[27:49.480 --> 27:51.400]  They're going to take your pensions.
[27:51.400 --> 27:55.120]  They're going to pull your wife over and take the money out of her purse.
[27:55.120 --> 28:00.760]  They're going to take it all in Chicago, in New York, in DC, in LA, everywhere the New
[28:00.760 --> 28:02.440]  World Order is in control.
[28:02.440 --> 28:06.600]  They're going to take, there's a new video out of a cameraman on a street corner and
[28:06.600 --> 28:07.600]  the cop walks up.
[28:07.600 --> 28:12.520]  It's on infowars.com and says, I'm going to smash your teeth in with that camera.
[28:12.520 --> 28:13.520]  And you know what?
[28:13.520 --> 28:14.520]  All of the country, they do.
[28:14.520 --> 28:16.400]  They show you who you are.
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.640]  Just like they're going to show everybody that they run Alcada and they run the chemical
[28:20.640 --> 28:24.200]  attacks and they run the whole thing right now.
[28:24.200 --> 28:25.800]  They're going to show you.
[28:25.800 --> 28:30.760]  Of course, the truth is everybody's just waking up and we're going to show the New World Order.
[28:30.760 --> 28:33.080]  You thugs thought Americans were cowards.
[28:33.080 --> 28:36.560]  Let me give you a little real insight on the American people.
[28:36.560 --> 28:38.520]  The American people haven't been cowards.
[28:38.520 --> 28:42.840]  They've been too busy working, paying the private federal reserve via the IRS.
[28:42.840 --> 28:46.920]  They've been too busy drugged up on all the GMO and the fluoride in the water.
[28:46.920 --> 28:50.360]  They haven't been, they haven't been afraid of all your intimidation.
[28:50.360 --> 28:52.920]  They've been too busy or too lazy.
[28:52.920 --> 28:57.920]  But now you're going to shove people around a little too much, aren't you?
[28:57.920 --> 29:00.320]  But I mean, that's what I'm talking about.
[29:00.320 --> 29:03.680]  Is people are waking up and saying, no, look at this right here.
[29:03.680 --> 29:09.040]  But when you go into D.C., folks, you're there to be preyed upon by a criminal kleptocracy.
[29:09.040 --> 29:11.720]  Do you understand that?
[29:11.720 --> 29:15.080]  And they'd have the whole country like D.C. if they could.
[29:15.080 --> 29:21.920]  A bunch of criminals paid for by taxpayer money with armed guards, in armored fortresses
[29:21.920 --> 29:24.000]  with a disarmed slave population.
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.680]  Remember the famous video came out last year?
[29:25.680 --> 29:29.400]  A family asked the police politely for directions, tourist.
[29:29.400 --> 29:30.400]  And the cop goes, pull over.
[29:30.400 --> 29:34.680]  I'm going to arrest you for asking me directions.
[29:34.680 --> 29:38.640]  I mean, it's not like New York where they say, am I a phone book and yell at you?
[29:38.640 --> 29:39.640]  They go, you know what?
[29:39.640 --> 29:44.080]  I'm going to take your whole family to jail and CPS is going to take your kids.
[29:44.080 --> 29:46.480]  But sir, I just asked directions politely.
[29:46.480 --> 29:50.040]  You pull over scum right now.
[29:50.040 --> 29:53.760]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:53.760 --> 30:00.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.720 --> 30:05.440]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[30:05.440 --> 30:08.520]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[30:08.520 --> 30:14.080]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[30:14.080 --> 30:16.040]  It all comes down to one thing.
[30:16.040 --> 30:17.680]  We are what we eat.
[30:17.680 --> 30:22.320]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[30:22.320 --> 30:26.560]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[30:26.560 --> 30:29.120]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[32:01.240 --> 32:03.640]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[32:03.640 --> 32:08.560]  By two thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their
[32:08.560 --> 32:11.360]  lives that the disaster won't get them.
[32:11.360 --> 32:16.280]  Hundreds of you helped E-Foods Direct ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[32:16.280 --> 32:18.440]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[32:18.440 --> 32:23.040]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take
[32:23.040 --> 32:24.880]  care of those who really can't.
[32:24.880 --> 32:29.600]  The new Justin Case Pack from E-Foods Direct is the big brother to the seven-day emergency

[33:01.120 --> 33:07.560]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[33:07.560 --> 33:11.720]  Government is the problem.
[33:11.720 --> 33:16.840]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be
[33:16.840 --> 33:19.400]  managed by self-rule.
[33:19.400 --> 33:27.440]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[33:27.440 --> 33:33.040]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:33.040 --> 33:43.600]  Hello, me, meet the real me, and my misfits waive life, a dark black past is my most valued
[33:43.600 --> 33:44.600]  possession.
[33:44.600 --> 33:50.600]  Wow, we're getting a little bit of a confession here from John Kerry coming in.
[33:50.600 --> 33:55.880]  No, actually, that's Dave Mustaine.
[33:55.880 --> 33:57.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[33:57.680 --> 34:01.040]  Here's some of the headlines up on infowars.com.
[34:01.040 --> 34:04.600]  Report China sends warships to the coast of Syria.
[34:04.600 --> 34:09.240]  Russia warns of nuke disaster if Syria attacked.
[34:09.240 --> 34:13.200]  Atrocities committed by Syrian protesters, as CNN calls them.
[34:13.200 --> 34:15.360]  Chopping people's heads off is protesting.
[34:15.360 --> 34:18.240]  Is this what we fight for?
[34:18.240 --> 34:25.800]  We've got a movie star coming out, Ms. Milano doing a fake sex tape.
[34:25.800 --> 34:27.240]  Fushing the Syrian war.
[34:27.240 --> 34:31.880]  Man, those fake liberals in Hollywood are the scum of the planet.
[34:31.880 --> 34:37.600]  Continuing the Syrian war, what you're not being told by zero hedge, Pentagon knew in
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.240]  2012 it would take 75,000 ground troops to secure serious chemical weapons facilities,
[34:43.240 --> 34:44.240]  bare minimum.
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.680]  John Kerry steals Wolfowitz's lines for Syria war.
[34:48.680 --> 34:56.320]  Two members of Congress join 14 others in saying that we need to impeach Obama and two
[34:56.320 --> 35:01.280]  other members join them in saying that we don't want to be al-Qaeda's air force.
[35:01.280 --> 35:04.600]  So that line is definitely getting picked up.
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.800]  And some of the news up on drudgerport.com, Russia claims 100 page report blaming Syrian
[35:09.800 --> 35:11.560]  rebels for chemical weapons attack.
[35:11.560 --> 35:12.720]  I mentioned that.
[35:12.720 --> 35:13.880]  It's out of McClatchy.
[35:13.880 --> 35:15.520]  I'm not tooting our horn.
[35:15.520 --> 35:20.880]  Back in March, the Russians put out a smaller report that this is based on.
[35:20.880 --> 35:22.800]  It was sent to the United States in July.
[35:22.800 --> 35:24.200]  We covered it again.
[35:24.200 --> 35:26.120]  We covered this again yesterday.
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.200]  Now it's national news with McClatchy mirroring our report.
[35:30.200 --> 35:34.240]  By the way, I noticed trolls in our article saying we were liars yesterday.
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.600]  We're not lying about any of this.
[35:37.600 --> 35:40.040]  People want to sit there and claim we're making stuff up.
[35:40.040 --> 35:45.040]  By the way, I was thinking this morning, I didn't really get scared, but I realized
[35:45.040 --> 35:46.800]  how much danger I'm probably in.
[35:46.800 --> 35:50.200]  So we need your prayers.
[35:50.200 --> 35:57.520]  That we broke two days ago now on Tuesday evening, it's now Thursday morning or Thursday
[35:57.520 --> 36:01.520]  afternoon and sometimes hours.
[36:01.520 --> 36:08.360]  Our source at the Air Force base in West Texas.
[36:08.360 --> 36:11.680]  That a bunch of nuclear warheads that weren't supposed to even be on the base under treaty
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.960]  since the mid eighties were loaded on trucks and driven out and they asked the truck driver,
[36:17.960 --> 36:18.960]  where's this going?
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.640]  Because everybody was so freaked out and they said, South Carolina.
[36:23.640 --> 36:30.920]  And I mean, that's a real source known by us that was in charge of something.
[36:30.920 --> 36:31.920]  I'll just leave it at that.
[36:31.920 --> 36:32.920]  Okay.
[36:32.920 --> 36:34.400]  I mean, I'm sure the government's got everything tapped.
[36:34.400 --> 36:36.120]  We were told this over the phone and by tech.
[36:36.120 --> 36:38.200]  So the government even knows who it is.
[36:38.200 --> 36:42.520]  And the whole point is, they had the whole Minot-North Dakota deal where the cruise missiles
[36:42.520 --> 36:43.520]  came up missing.
[36:43.520 --> 36:47.800]  They had a whole congressional investigation and a bunch of people on the base got killed
[36:47.800 --> 36:50.080]  who were witnesses that saw it.
[36:50.080 --> 36:53.480]  And I mean, our source is not lying.
[36:53.480 --> 36:55.800]  And they were told they were nuclear weapons.
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.560]  I mean, I'm saying to myself, let's just say they were different warheads, maybe they
[36:59.560 --> 37:00.560]  were mistaken.
[37:00.560 --> 37:03.120]  You know, I don't want to believe this myself.
[37:03.120 --> 37:10.360]  I don't want to be the one breaking this and that's why I had to, I was jogging down the
[37:10.360 --> 37:11.360]  hiking bike trails.
[37:11.360 --> 37:15.440]  I had to just sit down for a minute and just think I was like, man, I don't like being
[37:15.440 --> 37:16.440]  in this position.
[37:16.440 --> 37:19.720]  And I don't mean to sit here and talk about myself on the show.
[37:19.720 --> 37:25.960]  It's just that this is fantastical that our governments hijacked by ruthless, crazy banks.
[37:25.960 --> 37:30.000]  They run al-Qaeda, they're shelling Christian villages as we speak.
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  The leftists are attacking me saying I'm racist because I'm covering it and calling me redneck,
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.640]  which is really racist.
[37:38.640 --> 37:42.280]  You've got Obama running around saying he never said there were red lines saying there'll
[37:42.280 --> 37:45.680]  be no boots on the ground when Kerry says, yeah, they need authorization because that
[37:45.680 --> 37:46.680]  may be needed.
[37:46.680 --> 37:52.760]  If Syria implodes when they're trying to implode it, the NSA spying on everyone, I told you
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.680]  years ago, the NSA spying on gun owners creating databases.
[37:57.680 --> 38:04.280]  Now the NRA has evidence of a suing over it, according to the Hill newspaper.
[38:04.280 --> 38:12.520]  NRA joins ACL lawsuit, ACL lawsuit claims NSA starting gun registry.
[38:12.520 --> 38:15.800]  Well, of course they have a gun registry.
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.600]  And of course they spy on everybody.
[38:21.600 --> 38:28.720]  And of course the DEA is in the NSA when you're on the phone talking about marijuana.
[38:28.720 --> 38:31.480]  Of course it's all illegal, of course they don't get warrants.
[38:31.480 --> 38:38.680]  They are a criminal group, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:38.680 --> 38:44.520]  And then we have the spectacle of Barack Obama in Sweden yesterday before he got on
[38:44.520 --> 38:51.360]  a plane and flew into St. Petersburg in Russia with a G20 summit and a reporter who obviously
[38:51.360 --> 38:54.480]  is starstruck and really thinks this is a liberal God.
[38:54.480 --> 38:59.000]  They're so liberal in Sweden and they mean well.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.640]  They would put their kids in a garbage disposal, they were told to do it and told it was liberal.
[39:03.640 --> 39:05.960]  She's like, what about the dilemma?
[39:05.960 --> 39:12.560]  You have spoken for peace and in the war how you do it all.
[39:12.560 --> 39:24.720]  You've got Obama up there on the podium, I mean Obama is a front man reading off a teleprompter
[39:24.720 --> 39:32.360]  meant to sell the idea that he's a peace prize winner given a peace prize when he never had
[39:32.360 --> 39:37.720]  done anything for peace ever.
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.800]  And now they have orchestrated the Arab Spring to put radicals in every secular country and
[39:42.800 --> 39:49.200]  wreck them so they can slaughter Christians and Muslim minorities.
[39:49.200 --> 39:51.560]  I mean they really do it, that's what they want to do.
[39:51.560 --> 39:53.600]  That's who these control freaks are folks.
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.240]  They want to ban Christianity, Germany's banned homeschooling since World War II under Hitler
[39:58.240 --> 40:02.880]  and arrest people and takes their kids and drugs them.
[40:02.880 --> 40:08.040]  And when you flee to America and try to get political asylum, Eric Holder puts you on
[40:08.040 --> 40:14.880]  a plane back to Berlin to be arrested.
[40:14.880 --> 40:21.040]  These people are evil, I mean we're not just saying that, they're bad, they hate you.
[40:21.040 --> 40:23.200]  They hate private property not in their hands.
[40:23.200 --> 40:26.840]  They hate the fact you're armed and don't live in a crime syndicate like they do where
[40:26.840 --> 40:31.100]  you're fed on and the criminals then rob your house and pay loot to the police who then
[40:31.100 --> 40:32.920]  fence the money up.
[40:32.920 --> 40:39.680]  Bloomberg and all these people, the evidence-overwhelming folks, they're all part of it.
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.160]  They're criminals, they don't want you being armed, they don't want low crime rates.
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.960]  They live in armored compounds with 15 bodyguards.
[40:46.960 --> 40:49.240]  They enjoy you living in fear.
[40:49.240 --> 40:53.600]  They enjoy women being raped every night, walking back from work in New York and can't
[40:53.600 --> 40:54.800]  protect themselves.
[40:54.800 --> 40:57.360]  They love it and they're going to keep doing it.
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.440]  They are criminals, criminals are criminals because they have criminal mindsets.
[41:02.440 --> 41:09.560]  They are master criminals filled with criminal energy and it's going to take liberty energy
[41:09.560 --> 41:15.680]  and true warrior energy who values honor and who values goodness.
[41:15.680 --> 41:21.080]  We have to smash these cockroaches and to do that first you've got to stand up and say,
[41:21.080 --> 41:24.720]  I don't care what you do to me, you maggots.
[41:24.720 --> 41:30.400]  I know you're the scum of the earth and I'm coming after you with the pen which is mine
[41:30.400 --> 41:34.600]  here in the sword and we are going to lay waste to you frauds.
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.080]  So do whatever you're going to do, we're committing and it's a good feeling to be driving this
[41:39.080 --> 41:40.080]  train.
[41:40.080 --> 41:46.560]  You're driving your train out there as well of resistance and just to slam down the lever
[41:46.560 --> 41:52.360]  and just say, I'm going full speed ahead into the enemy and just sit there hopping around
[41:52.360 --> 41:57.520]  in the carriage of that thing with bloodshot eyes staring out the front visor and that's
[41:57.520 --> 41:59.360]  what life's all about ladies and gentlemen.
[41:59.360 --> 42:05.680]  We're going to ram these people down, we're going to run over them.
[42:05.680 --> 42:10.360]  Now if people are freaked out by this folks, you're freaked out by the spirit of liberty.
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.320]  Paul Revere and others wrote all up and down the colonies saying get your firearms and
[42:14.320 --> 42:17.400]  get ready to kill people.
[42:17.400 --> 42:20.520]  That's what to arms to arms the red coats are coming means.
[42:20.520 --> 42:25.240]  Get your guns get ready to kill people like oh what a great patriot.
[42:25.240 --> 42:32.360]  I get up there with Piers Morgan and say you're on notice boy we're done you want to enslave
[42:32.360 --> 42:37.160]  us don't say you care about the kids this is about enslaving us under the UN treaties
[42:37.160 --> 42:43.520]  and if you try to take our guns 1776 will commence again because that's what's going to happen.
[42:43.520 --> 42:47.320]  You think you're going to have some civil war and pain us as terrorists and you're just
[42:47.320 --> 42:49.640]  going to walk all over us buddy.
[42:49.640 --> 42:54.880]  I'm calling you out and I'm marking you as an enemy if all this stuff goes down.
[42:54.880 --> 43:01.040]  You think you people are just going to pull some type of commie red car takeover and we're
[43:01.040 --> 43:03.680]  just going to sit here and take it.
[43:03.680 --> 43:07.600]  You think you're going to run all kind of and murder Christians worldwide and we're going
[43:07.600 --> 43:15.640]  to sit there and not speak out against it.
[43:15.640 --> 43:26.840]  You think we're just going to stand down.
[43:26.840 --> 43:32.800]  You think that we're just going to go along with all of this if you think that you've
[43:32.800 --> 43:41.280]  got another thing coming and people say man this guy gets crazed I am crazed.
[43:41.280 --> 43:45.040]  I know we're fighting tyrants I know they're killers we're breaking news about missing
[43:45.040 --> 43:46.880]  nuclear weapons folks.
[43:46.880 --> 43:51.760]  You think this is fun this is not a game and people need to get that through their heads
[43:51.760 --> 43:58.160]  but I have chosen not to be a coward I have chosen to not crouch down and lick the hands
[43:58.160 --> 43:59.160]  that feed us.
[43:59.160 --> 44:01.160]  I don't want to be fed by the new world order.
[44:01.160 --> 44:05.960]  The war has already begun the globalists are exterminating innocent people from Africa
[44:05.960 --> 44:13.000]  to Latin America for UN carbon sinks taking over their property to give it to big agribusiness.
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.600]  They are involved in forced sterilization extermination programs worldwide of course
[44:17.600 --> 44:22.160]  they lie to you of course they put poison in your water.
[44:22.160 --> 44:25.240]  You've always been the globalist enemies of America and the reason America's haven't
[44:25.240 --> 44:29.040]  woken up sooner is they've been chemically lobotomizing us.
[44:29.040 --> 44:36.240]  We've been under chemical warfare and so now I ask all the listeners out there this question
[44:36.240 --> 44:41.160]  they're going to stage something will it be a fake assassination attempt on Obama will
[44:41.160 --> 44:45.920]  it be another big nerve gas attack they stage will it be launching medium range missiles
[44:45.920 --> 44:52.720]  out of Syria at Israel saying that Assad did it will it be setting off an atomic bomb in
[44:52.720 --> 45:00.160]  a major US city a low yield weapon so they can bring in the whole martial law group will
[45:00.160 --> 45:06.320]  it be going ahead and just invading and using that crisis as a political distraction will
[45:06.320 --> 45:12.080]  it be a mass shooting blamed on a militia group working with jihadists I mean we can
[45:12.080 --> 45:16.000]  see that script being pushed we know what they're going to do we know they're different
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.160]  avenues they're different battle plans because they war game those and they push those narratives
[45:22.160 --> 45:28.160]  out there so the public has already been acclimatized to it so you'll buy the story when it happens
[45:28.160 --> 45:35.680]  a self-fulfilling prophecy a revelation of the method an externalization of the hierarchy
[45:35.680 --> 45:42.560]  a subconscious scott com syndrome stimuli to scare your subconscious that knows they're
[45:42.560 --> 45:49.840]  the ones behind it when they get up there and tell these lies that are so obvious and
[45:49.840 --> 45:54.400]  admit the NSA spying on you and all this they want to scare everybody so everybody goes
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.000]  oh my gosh they are the terrorist oh my gosh they do run al-qaeda oh my gosh they're we
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.280]  better shut up we better keep our heads down they might come get us they're going to get
[46:02.280 --> 46:07.680]  everybody if we don't stand up against us okay they're going to get everybody if we
[46:07.680 --> 46:13.040]  don't stand up against the new world order and we the people have to come together against
[46:13.040 --> 46:22.960]  this the globalist are fundamentally against us they're already putting sodium fluoride
[46:22.960 --> 46:28.920]  in the water they're already putting the GMOs by designing the foods the the the the hidden
[46:28.920 --> 46:33.360]  viruses that have been identified all the rest of it just makes me sick i mean we are
[46:33.360 --> 46:41.600]  living in an absolute science fiction movie and they are waging war on us a tiny kleptocratic
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.080]  group that think they're playing god that see the general public as a scourge that is
[46:46.080 --> 46:52.880]  infested the earth and they are waging war on us and so many yuppies out there think
[46:52.880 --> 46:58.720]  that there are too many people so like you're part of the establishment because you tacitly
[46:58.720 --> 47:05.280]  buy into this whole thing and feel like you're a member of the establishment that is not
[47:05.280 --> 47:14.880]  how this works you have already been targeted many people out there listening to me are
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.120]  going to end up getting diagnosed with terminal cancer in the near future your neighbors your
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.280]  friends your family are because we're under attack they've already gotten a lot of us
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.360]  they've already they've already assaulted us over and over again through the water through
[47:28.360 --> 47:32.920]  the food that's what these cowards do they don't stand up and fight us they do it incrementally
[47:32.920 --> 47:38.240]  they do it in the dark they creep around and they want to just tell us be calm and go back
[47:38.240 --> 47:43.960]  to sleep and or be a member of the establishment play ball there's no playing ball with these
[47:43.960 --> 47:54.360]  exterminist it's us or them let's go to this clip I was mentioning of Obama yesterday being
[47:54.360 --> 48:01.280]  asked by a reporter in Europe about his peace prize which is such a sick joke now which they
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.360]  knew full well what Obama was planning was just a continuation of the globalist takeover
[48:05.360 --> 48:14.480]  program and that's part of the sick joke war is peace that's what this is let's go to the
[48:14.480 --> 48:22.800]  clip Mr. President you've given very eloquent talks about the moral force of non-violence
[48:22.800 --> 48:28.400]  I was wondering could you describe the dilemma to be a Nobel Peace Prize winner and getting
[48:28.400 --> 48:36.560]  ready to attack Syria and also in what way did the talk that they had today with Prime
[48:36.560 --> 48:45.360]  Minister Reinfeldt move the world a step closer to resolving the climate crisis I would refer
[48:45.360 --> 48:55.600]  you to the speech that I gave when I received the Nobel Prize and I think I started the
[48:55.600 --> 49:05.400]  speech by saying that compared to previous recipients I was certainly unworthy but what
[49:05.400 --> 49:15.920]  I also described was the challenge that all of us face when we believe in peace but we
[49:15.920 --> 49:26.600]  confront a world that is full of violence and occasional evil war is peace that's enough
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.280]  for him becomes what our responsibility now remember they think you're so dumb that they
[49:30.280 --> 49:34.880]  don't they don't think that you know that they started the war with Syria injecting
[49:34.880 --> 49:40.240]  rebels and they call activist I saw CNN again yesterday called them protesters and activist
[49:40.240 --> 49:46.320]  with tanks and rocket launchers and any aircraft missiles okay so so I want to open the phones
[49:46.320 --> 49:51.200]  up now and in the next hour we'll go to your phone calls do you think I'm right this is
[49:51.200 --> 49:54.600]  a collapse in confidence in them I mean I know I'm right but what's your take on that
[49:54.600 --> 49:59.960]  and how big this is a b what do you think the false flag is going to be because there's
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.600]  no way you can see it in their body language you could see it they're freaked out they
[50:04.600 --> 50:10.240]  know the world sees exactly who they are but they're still in control of the banking system
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.640]  they're in control of the private Federal Reserve they're in control of the infrastructure
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.920]  they've got their media takeover systems in place they've got paramilitary troops trained
[50:18.920 --> 50:24.680]  in every city to take on the American people I mean they they are the global occupiers
[50:24.680 --> 50:30.080]  they are the foreign banker takeover armies who wear our flag on their shoulder they are
[50:30.080 --> 50:37.720]  the infiltrator they are the enemy they are the you know terminators might as well be space

[55:07.440 --> 55:12.080]  they think we're animals the globalists are in charge because they sit there and manipulate
[55:12.080 --> 55:15.720]  us and you know we act like dumb animals well guess what we're not dumb animals and we're
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.920]  waking up to what's going on and we're upset about it and we see the piles of steaming degeneracy
[55:21.920 --> 55:27.200]  that are the senators and other supporting war and we know who they are and now they've
[55:27.200 --> 55:31.480]  gone from not having the votes in the house to if they might lose by 100 votes now it's
[55:31.480 --> 55:37.560]  being reported so then Obama says you'll go ahead with it see charity is like a juggernaut
[55:37.560 --> 55:42.640]  that has momentum but once it goes into mud and if it ever stops folks it ain't getting
[55:42.640 --> 55:51.080]  out the new world orders never stopped in the last hundred years or so and always if
[55:51.080 --> 55:54.240]  they start to stop they'll stay something even bigger to get them out of it so let me tell
[55:54.240 --> 56:00.240]  you we're not winning this thing we're in the fight but we are winning the awakening

[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.760]  collapse in the establishment's credibility one of the greatest diplomatic meltdowns for the new
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:48.680]  world order ever and that now no one believes what they're basically saying and just two three days
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:54.440]  ago they were 20 votes short in the house to get a war resolution that's passed out of the senate
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.680]  committee going to the full senate rand paul saying he's going to fill a blaster god blessing
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.840]  isn't it good to have a few patriots up there we've got
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:10.840]  uh now some estimates are 100 votes short in the house so obama says well i'll just go ahead
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:16.040]  without congressional approval but at least we force them to talk about the constitution
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.960]  and congressional approval and if this war criminal is going to do it he's going to do it on
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.880]  his own and you've got thousands of military going public saying they will not serve over there as
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:31.080]  the air force for al qaeda as the ground troops for al qaeda and the russians have released a full
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:37.000]  report to the world that they released back in july but an expanded report from the march chemical
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.600]  weapons attack um they're in syria that was documented to be the rebels and there's video of
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:50.680]  the rebels in that case as well bragging they launched the chemical attack then an ap reporter
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:56.840]  not the ap a reporter that reports for the ap separately published an article that went worldwide
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:03.080]  last week that they talked to all these people over there who said yeah no we launched the chemical
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:10.520]  attack well of course they did but listen russia says it's compiled a 100 page report blaming syria
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:17.800]  rebels for a chemical weapons attack going back to the march attack so they say that makes them the
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:26.040]  main suspects this time that is out of mclancy continuing russia warns of nuclear disaster
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.920]  if syria is attacked saying there is a small experimental nuclear reactor a neutron source
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:38.920]  reactor or msnr saying they've got at the university of texas and austin outside demascus the rebels
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.320]  have been trying to take over and we have fox news reporting finally what we've been talking about
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:50.520]  for two and a half years on a daily basis rebels took a hilltop monastery put everybody to the
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:11:01.240]  sword reportedly and began shelling ap's reporting began shelling the christian town well what are
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:08.120]  they going to get an aclu award for that al qaeda link syrian rebels fight army near christian village
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.640]  and the army is apologized they they they the al qaeda forces are too well trained by the us and
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:18.520]  nato and uh they're they're beating the army there right now so they're gonna they're gonna be able
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.560]  to slaughter all the christians so big victory for obama you have another peace prize for that one
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:29.960]  and there's videos of the syrian soldiers they're capturing should we play this because we have a
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:36.600]  family viewing audience of them chopping their heads off because you know they have some news
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.120]  footage where it doesn't show them being chopped off they have others where it shows them chopping
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:45.080]  them off and throwing them off roofs you know what the media is showing is them preparing to
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:49.560]  chop their heads off um there's a whole bunch of these videos you know what you can go find them
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.680]  if you want to look at on the point is now the ap now fox news now it's all being uh reported on
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:05.000]  it here's the new york times on that subject brutality of syrian rebels posing dilemma for
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.560]  the west well let me just give the rebels a peace prize and it makes it okay new york times reports
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.760]  kary portrait of syrian rebels at odds with intelligence reports when kary said uh in his
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:20.360]  testimony on the last two days to the senate and the house uh the house yesterday sent it on tuesday
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.080]  is that there's no al-qaeda connections no
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.080]  there's nothing going on here
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.880]  continuing uh and by the way that's roiders now saying kary's not telling the truth
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:40.600]  uh continuing opposition to syria war goes all the way to the pentagon now there's more and more
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.520]  people in the pentagon going public saying they'll support it and general dempsi the chairman joint
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.720]  chiefs said months ago it's a bad idea but you know so what obama in his speech said dempsi said it
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:55.480]  was a good idea he said the chairman meaning the chairman of the joint chief says this is doable
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.800]  and is the right thing to do of course dempsi didn't ever say that but so what hey if you're
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:06.040]  gonna tell one lie why not tell a thousand my wife had a bag of potato chips last night and

[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:33.640]  just in case you missed it we played this last hour here is obama back in august of last year
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:41.000]  saying that he had set a red line clearly and then now he's saying he never said that so here's
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:48.920]  both those clips we have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:57.880]  on the ground that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.920]  moving around or being utilized that would change my calculus that would change my equation
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.640]  first of all i didn't set a red line the world set a red line
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.440]  there you go so there he is a few days ago he didn't set a red line now here's the bottom
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.080]  line if you just joined us i believe this is a total collapse of confidence in them i don't believe
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:25.080]  that i know that it is seismic it is historical it is ground shaking the empire will strike back
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.120]  the question now to listeners all the way into the next hour when larry pratt joins us at the
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:36.600]  bottom of the hour with some key second amendment updates the big 64 trillion dollar question here
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:45.240]  is what are they going to do to haul their bacon will they launch an attack out of syria or give
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:50.440]  medium-range missiles to rebels they fire at israel to then blame on Assad will they launch
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:55.160]  another chemical attack they've done it at least three times now and been caught that's now mainstream
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:02.120]  news uh will they attack a super bowl and say Assad did it will they attack and say the patriots
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.080]  did it to get a diversion going uh will they set up a small nuke will they release a bio weapon
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:12.840]  and say it's some new sarge deal i mean let me tell you something their whole agenda everybody
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:19.000]  starting to speak out against them and so they know that makes it safer for other people to
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.680]  and more whistleblowers and everything they fear and the nra suing the nsa for secret anti gun
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.440]  databases gun owner databases and everybody starts waking up and everybody gets past their fear
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:37.000]  it's over for them folks it's chelchescu type stuff like in romania you don't know about the
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.080]  fall of chest chescu look it up it's fall of the soviet union i've been saying for two weeks folks
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.480]  this is like the fall of the soviet union now it may not happen this month or even next year but let
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:53.400]  me tell you all the king's horses and all the king's men are not going to be able to put the
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:27:01.720]  new order back together again the egg fell off it hit the cracks are all in it the yoke's starting
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:08.120]  to drip out it's falling apart right now they're not putting it back together again
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.080]  they're not going to be able to do it i've looked at every angle they are in deep trouble
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:21.240]  they are in deep trouble and i'm telling you the talking points you see everywhere
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:25.080]  are our talking points because we just go with the truth and what's really happening
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:31.400]  and the fact that we're at the core of this resistance is is is so historical and it's
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:39.320]  incredibly dangerous so as i said please pray for us because history is happening right now and
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.760]  this is another testament to what good men can do standing up to tyranny and what good women can do
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:49.640]  and i want to salute our audience our affiliates our sponsors everyone that's helped us you're
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:56.280]  all part of this in fact you can enjoy being part of it in in in it's not a dangerous position as
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:04.360]  people like i am in or ran paul are in or matt drudge is in or pat bucanon is in the system
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:11.560]  does not like leaders who are not evil and who cannot be bought so i want you to understand
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:16.920]  the playing field here if we didn't do all that to get ran paul in and we didn't do all the things
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.320]  we've done we would have nobody up there to point out the discrepancies let's go to one call
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.360]  we're going to break eric in new york what do you think about a false flag do you think confidence
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.960]  is collapsing in the establishment hey alex yeah man i definitely think so and i just wanted to
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:37.080]  raise one question i want to know who's going to take over syria after the obama administration
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:41.400]  gets us thought out because they haven't really uh they're going to give the north and the south
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:47.800]  to al-qaeda and then they're going to break up one of the areas to the curds they're in the east
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:54.600]  and they're going to get part of it to turkey i mean they want up to five parts a minimum of two
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.560]  it'll probably end up being broken in three and they will exterminate christians from end to end
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.920]  and it'll never end and they'll maybe have hollywood will have maybe have a celebration
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:10.200]  on tv or something about it i don't know okay and um what do you think about pakistan and india
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:15.720]  well what there are two oh yeah that could be the trigger uh the and again i'm not on the side of
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.880]  india or pakistan i'm on the side of all those people that live in those countries those humans
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:24.440]  that are genetically pretty much the same people the west is trying to get india to start stuff with
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:29.960]  pakistan continually so yeah that could be a big flashpoint boom they've moved the big fleets to asia
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:35.800]  exactly well the middle east sets off watch what happens in asia absolutely that's what our high
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:40.440]  level sources have been saying for about four years very well said eric great point yeah well you
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.800]  never know what card they're gonna pull but they're gonna pull something probably be another chemical

[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:41.640]  western side of the nation the russians have been massing in the last month troops all along
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:50.200]  their border near syria and moving obviously other weapon systems into the area and the news of
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:56.600]  india is reporting pakistani jets leave for war games in china getting into what the last caller
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:03.320]  was bringing up they could try to start a war over there as a political diversion this is what corrupt
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:08.360]  governments and empires do they start wars and then if that war is not going good they start another
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:14.840]  war that is historically the pattern and if you look at the pattern it's very serious and now
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.000]  pelosi says they don't think they have the democratic votes no kidding you don't have the republican
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:30.280]  votes now i saw an article yesterday what was it out of the hill where they had 498 phone calls at
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:41.160]  one congressperson's home home district office 498 calls to two in fact i actually have the
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:49.640]  article on my phone let me see here i'll actually pull up that article itself so i can tell the crew
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:35:02.600]  about it and actually get them to actually get them to pull it up just absolutely amazing that
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:10.040]  things like that are going on and you've got unprecedented resistance to what these tyrants
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:16.600]  are up to and they trot out movie stars like malano says for the children let's attack syria
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:21.480]  when the west started this war for two and a half years i mean that's what's so rich about this
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:29.400]  is that the system engineered this started it and then grandstand is the saviors and then
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:35.640]  carrie and obama both say if anything else bad happens it's those of you that don't let us bomb
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:47.320]  the country it's your fault and they've only gotten away with this because people weren't
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:55.800]  paying attention well guess what ladies and gentlemen folks are now paying attention big time
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.920]  world net daily is now reporting on it i saw this last night now it's calls to congress
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:11.480]  499 to one against the syria war americans are slamming at least 22 members of congress with
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.520]  thousands of phone calls and emails urging lawmakers not to approve a military strike on syria
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:24.760]  by a margin of as much as 499 to one as the national debate rages on twitter representative
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:31.240]  jim mcdermott of washington tweeted calls and emails from my constituents are 100 to one against
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:37.080]  getting involved in syria the american people are speaking a lives of comings said 99 percent of the
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:50.760]  calls to his office andy harris says constituents are 523 to 4 and and how they do that is they go
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:56.280]  through a roster of 20 members of congress and how many calls they're getting four versus against
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:02.040]  and it's 499 to one is what the math comes out to so that means there'll probably be a strike
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:09.800]  then if it's 499 to one see that's an awakening right there but i think this is so massive now
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:16.120]  that the house will vote and it'll be a 50 or more against it they'll lose by 50 or more votes
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:21.320]  maybe even 100 this is a landslide against them and i think they're going to state something
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:26.440]  and say well i have to do it i'm a leader and then the media will go he went against it as part of
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.480]  being a leader give him another peace prize to bring peace to syria that's what he said he said
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:35.640]  well i got the peace prize didn't say i deserved it but you know and being in for true peace is
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:40.920]  stopping violence and evil when it pops up occasionally i played that clip last hour
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:47.720]  i mean here's evil really popping up on the podium i mean this is it dressed to the nines
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:56.600]  this is evil everything it does pure evil this agenda here's its front man its figurehead
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:02.440]  its mast head its logo obama the trendy hi
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.800]  all right i said to go to your calls i'm hogging the air time here
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.960]  tom in new york do you think this is a major defeat forum do you agree with that
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:19.720]  a and b more importantly do you think they're going to stage something to pose as our saviors
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:28.280]  um no actually i uh i believe uh just too much the lighting uh uh
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:34.760]  you know uh shine on the uh you know the issue and i think they're going to back off on it
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.920]  uh at least immediately might try to uh wait a month or two and then start something else
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:50.360]  but uh you know i was listening to the uh uh the debate yesterday with carry albama
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:58.040]  uh they were talking about the 1925 uh treaty and uh i was wondering if uh you've ever heard
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:08.840]  of the uh incident in 19 uh somewhere in the late 90s with uh uh well the countries are now
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:15.160]  pushing for a war over there uh where they had launched their own chemical attacks against
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:22.040]  al-qaeda and uh sot arabia uh i think a couple of folks have been written about the uh the incident
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:29.960]  al-qaeda was poised to take over in sot arabia they're uprising in the late 90s and the only
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.240]  way they were able to break it up was with the french special forces going in there with chemical
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:42.520]  weapons which they uh you know apparently succeeded in uh and wiping out al-qaeda but uh
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:54.040]  yes i was aware i was aware of those um uh developments and look the sunshine project in 1999
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:40:01.480]  based in austin texas was able to get a declassified marine corps document that was then reclassified
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:06.120]  the sunshine project was threatened you can pull these up still on google wayback machine though
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.240]  or the google archive i don't know why the marine corps threatened them because they didn't even get
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:14.920]  it off the the google system and we've done reports on this and i had the director of the
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.720]  sunshine project on at the time we should get them back on it's now defunct but the government shut
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:24.600]  it down it's kind of like a proto wiki leaks but but this was declassified they reclassified it
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:30.520]  and said it was improperly classified that they have a program with helicopters pre-positioned
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:36.760]  around the us with opiate knockout gases that they estimate will kill more than 10% of the
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:40.920]  population because you'll have car wrecks fires they fly over and spray you with this stuff and
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:46.600]  it knocks everybody out but but beyond that that they have chemical weapons if those don't work
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:51.320]  and people ask how's the government going to defeat us how's homeland security if we were ever
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:56.120]  really about to take dc back or take colorado springs back from the new world order they will
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:01.400]  nerve gases i mean that is the plan the nerve gases for us and this is stuff where it doesn't
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:06.520]  matter if you have a gas mask whatever you're dead and that's why they're so arrogant but
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.720]  the military would probably say no to doing that that's why they'll use foreigners or contractors
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:19.560]  but even beyond that they want to go to drones because the drone won't won't refuse orders
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.960]  so yes sir i am familiar with what you're bringing up i appreciate your call tom again i want to
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.840]  hear from listeners what do you think they may stage you know i that's what i said is what tom said
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:36.680]  if the globalists are smart they'll back off leave this alone and try it again later but
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:44.040]  that's not how they've been operating but they may pull back and wait and stage something down the
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:51.240]  road oh solid chemicals again come on we got to do something steam in florida you're on the air
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:59.000]  what do you think's going on yeah how else uh okay a few things here um first of all thinking back
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:06.360]  to your uh bombshell documentary obama deception if you remember topfully had mentioned about the
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:12.120]  big new brzezinski uh one of obama's chief advisors and his inbred hatred for russia
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:21.080]  and so you know obama was having military outposts and such set up around russia and so first of
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:27.880]  all i'm thinking that you know the deal with syria this is a little fish that they're going after
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:34.920]  yeah it's part of what uh uh pastor uh i can't remember the pastor's name um thank you will you
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:43.320]  know yeah that talked about what his uh globalist uh men had you know mr axe and ken flan had said
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:48.600]  it's following out what basically they've said about the middle east and but what i'm saying is
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:55.160]  that these globalists they have a bigger fish to fry and that's russia and the other thing is
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:01.800]  if people want a good insight into the mindset of these globalists i'd really highly recommend
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:06.840]  and i don't know if you've got to interview these people doubts uh kathiel brine's and mark
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.440]  still a bombshell book the transformation of america yeah just answer your question i have
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:17.000]  i have interviewed them i don't think they can prove their story one way or the other so i don't
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.480]  go there but we know the types of things they talk about do go on that's been declassified i
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:27.160]  appreciate your call i mean there's i mean there's dr ewing cameron and jolly and west and the mk
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:33.800]  altar hearings and foster kids grabbed and and and electro shocked and reprogrammed and soldiers
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.360]  i mean the stuff you see in the boron movies i mean that's basically real in fact they even
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.400]  have the viruses they inject you with that are designed to reprogram certain areas of the brain
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:48.920]  to eat certain areas of the brain uh that basically are there as a governor so a guy that can only
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:54.840]  bench press 300 pounds the governor's gone they can now bench press 600 pounds you know the governor's
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:44:01.240]  gone you can now walk you know 100 miles whereas before you could only you know walk 50 miles i mean
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:08.360]  that newborn movie it doesn't have met daemon and it has the other guy the guy from hurt locker i
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:14.040]  went saw it i'm like this is like real i mean i just unbelievable based on the ludlum books but
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:20.840]  but modernized i gotta see that movie again it's unbelievable how accurate it is that's exactly
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.800]  the kind of stuff going on so i'm gonna do a mind control show i'll do it not on people that claim
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:32.040]  they were under it no offense to them i'm gonna i mean it's just like wallowing in all the admissions
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:39.320]  i mean we're drowning in thousands of admissions and the scientists that would run it would then
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:46.600]  have sex with the kids and that all came out just a bunch of perverts and brain chips in people in
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.160]  the 60s all just huxley before he died admitted that they already had silicon chips in people's
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.320]  brains before those were supposedly even invented i mean ladies and gentlemen it's way they're 30
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:59.560]  years beyond what we even know that's why they're so arrogant it's why they act like they're not
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:05.960]  humans because they're like they're like advanced next level civilization psychopaths that hoarded
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.280]  all the technology and got it and now they've got like space-based weapons platforms and
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.320]  bio weapons that kill 100 of the people and public stuff that kills 98 percent and fish
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:21.960]  and fusion bombs and black hole bombs and any matter bombs you go read the literature they've
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:27.080]  got i mean it's just like nope i mean it's just it's it only god can save us at this point i mean
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:34.600]  i'm gonna but god wants us to act against the evil like in the fiery furnace or in the lion's den
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.920]  that's when god then gives the providence you've got to have the courage and say i stand against
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:44.280]  the evil then god activates that's and that's historical ladies and gentlemen you don't believe
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:51.000]  in god the force of the universe it's there okay and you've got to say i'm doing the right thing
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.840]  come hook or crook i'm not backing down this is it i'm all in i'm committed and now when you do that
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:03.240]  the world just goes it opens up and you're like wow that's when the universe opens up and the
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.280]  globalists are just focused on their little evil system to control i mean of course any of us who
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:14.440]  were smart could go be evil and be incredibly successful being bad but you're committing
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.640]  a crime against your own progeny against yourself it's it's you know these elite groups that think
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:24.360]  their families will be sheltered from all the stuff they've done it's not going to happen again i want
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:30.280]  to ask the listeners this question right now and we got loaded phone lines here what do you think
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.880]  the false flag will be to change the subject or do you think they won't do it and yes of course this
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:41.320]  is about russia not that russia's perfect it's just a block not fully controlled by the dominant
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.760]  globalist but it's not just syria being a little fish though this could start nuclear war
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:54.120]  do i have to walk through it again folks syria gets attacked syria attacks israel i ran attacks
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:47:03.000]  israel israel responds this is on the low end of damage the straight of or mousse is blocked by
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:09.160]  30 or 40 sunken ships they've got ready tankers the forces that go in and clog it or attack
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:15.720]  all hell breaks loose on the sewers canal by egypt and israel the gaza stuff starts
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:20.840]  so everybody starts attacking radical groups use the use the excuse to it's like when there's a
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:24.120]  you know bank robbers will start a fire on one end of town to go rob the bank on the other end
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:30.120]  all the crazies who are really controlled by no one they're just a loud end the jihadis will go crazy
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:35.240]  in saudi arabia and the globalist plan to just sit back and let this conflagration start going
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.560]  and then use that as the political distraction to do whatever they want us forces are massing in
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.800]  the middle east right now so they pulled them out of afghanistan and iraq to a great extent
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:48.840]  to get them ready in jordan and israel and other areas us troops have been massing in turkey
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:55.000]  they've been massing for months they've got missile cruisers nuke subs b1 bombers b2 bombers
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:02.840]  aircraft carriers diego garcia loaded with nuclear weapons just on national guard on alert nuke's
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:10.680]  getting moved around wrath of god type stuff cats and dogs living together as they say in ghost
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:18.280]  postures but it's not funny it's not funny and maybe it won't happen i hope it doesn't
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:22.920]  and then if it doesn't look oh i thought there was going to be a nuclear war alex no there could be
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:32.520]  chris in iowa what's your view on all this sir yeah um i've just got a uh an observation that i
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:35.880]  think really much applies to what's going on and i wanted your advice with something serious
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:42.040]  as far as i grew up in a college town uh i was sitting in a university of iowa last three four
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:46.600]  maybe even five years i've noticed um there's tons and tons of asian people moving in and
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:51.240]  i really like asian people so i keep you know keep it on out but then just last year i noticed one
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:57.400]  uh he totally looked military at a silver star a gold ring around it on a beret and he was just
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.960]  walking through but i think he was reconning reconning the place and like he was saying that
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:07.080]  the gold was pretty much run or own the colleges and if they were going to do like an invasion like
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.360]  i've been seen on the internet and stuff wouldn't that be the way to do it what they do is they get
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:17.800]  us into a bigger war then they start blowing stuff up domestically and then claim that the
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:22.440]  patriot movement's working with the foreign enemy and then they order the swat teams go out and you
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.640]  know pick up this first list of people kill them if they if they resist they'll have another list
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.080]  they send in mercs to to be killed and it'll be lots of people that work for the system
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:38.600]  it'll be lots of people that serve them but who know where the bodies are buried or old scores
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:43.320]  and i mean you'll see news suddenly you'll see new news anchors on a lot of the shows
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.960]  the globalist will probably well i mean they'll kill if they actually go with that plan which
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:56.360]  is in the cards i don't know they're gonna do it they will kill large percentages of people you
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:03.000]  see on television in a day they will wipe out many many members of the establishment uh who
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.360]  think they're part of the establishment that's because the establishment's always really targeting
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:11.800]  the establishment first then they'll try to wipe out people like alex jones we'll hear ron paul you
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:18.120]  know had a stroke or whatever and you know he'll and and there was a fire at his house you know
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:23.000]  i mean just you know stuff like that it that's how they do it they'll send storm troopers out
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.440]  night of the long knives to kill everybody does that answer your question well kind of it was more
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:33.080]  less it kind of looks like there'd be an inside job as far as letting china invade but like they've
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.800]  been kind of slowly doing it over the years was more less where they kind of look like to me well
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.320]  i mean americans have been so fluoridated and brainwashed a lot of them don't know how to run
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:47.960]  equipment so uh i mean they bring in folks from china because they work hard and are smart um but
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:52.440]  the globalists have a double deal with china they have given them the panamon canal
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:58.840]  and yes china is the retreat route for the roth child's rockefellers uh george soro san others

[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:27.000]  here's another big question i could throw out to the listeners on syria
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:33.160]  you've got thousands of military personnel coming out some of them that are getting ready to come
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:40.440]  on the show publicly and saying we're not going to fight for al-qaeda in syria people we fought
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:46.120]  what's going to happen when they implode syria go ahead with a strike and then go oh my goodness
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:49.960]  the chemical weapons are in danger that are legally and lawfully there we've got to send in
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:55.800]  75 000 troops to pentagon once i wonder how our military is going to like going in fighting side
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:02.360]  by side with al-qaeda with al-qaeda flags and then turning it over to them i guess the military
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:07.400]  instead of breaking you know following orders they'll just commit suicide why why not speak out
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:12.520]  and make the new rule orders life a living hell politically instead of blowing your head off me
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:18.760]  i guess they find people that follow orders so you kill yourselves for obama
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:25.800]  how about you make their life a living hell politically how about you work 18 hours a day
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:28.840]  against them instead of shoving a gun in your mouth and blowing in your brains out
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.400]  i don't think you're cowards folks but i think that's the wrong way out
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:39.720]  why don't you realize you've been conning and been working for evil as i know a lot of you do and

[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:15.960]  you're wrong the weight comes off your shoulders that's all god wants you to do and we don't believe

[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:39.000]  all right we're now well into the third hour going back to your phone calls larry pratt's
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.400]  coming up with a quick update on all these extra judicial gun confiscations going on outside of
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:54.520]  law and how law law recently passed the vetter amendment states that that's illegal and we'll
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:09:01.240]  also get his take on the whole situation in Syria and what that means to the world by the way for
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:05.640]  the average authoritarian yuppie out there that thinks they're liberal you know as long as they're
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:12.040]  wearing a trendy superhero shirt or something oil prizes will explode if there's a war over there
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:17.560]  it will undoubtedly in every major study they had out even last week that this will increase
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:23.160]  civilian casualties it's about wrecking another sovereign nation saudi arabia once control
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:28.600]  of the country they're offering to pay for it saudi arabia took it over in 1918 before and
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:34.840]  this is just nothing but a bunch of power grabbing and elements of israel are supporting this as well
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:40.920]  because they want to go after iran supporters but then now they're aiding al-qaeda it is totally
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:51.480]  immoral and it's extremely evil and you've got chinese ships going into the region now russian
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:57.480]  is sending more ships i mean this is really escalating fast okay and they wouldn't have moved
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:03.320]  b1 and b2 bombers into the theater with nukes and we know the jet aircraft left the last two weeks
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:08.600]  unless they were planning something big now we may be able to back them off but you got all the u.s
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:15.080]  military saying we're not going to aid boots on the ground going into that country so what's
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:19.080]  going to happen because the plan is to implode the country kerry said open if it imploded we'd
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:26.120]  have to invade with boots on the ground that's always been the plan because then they're going
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.760]  to double cross al-qaeda and only give them part of the country and then they and then our troops
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:36.760]  will be fighting them i mean this is so sick this is so macchiavelli and it's not being done for some
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:42.760]  greater good that's even a lie it'd be bad enough if we claim well it's for the greater good we've
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:49.720]  made the calculation no it's done to bring in evil it's done to give al-qaeda a new stronghold
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.440]  to then menace the west and the politicians think we're dumb and won't put put two and two together
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:11:00.120]  and go oh give my rights up because of al-qaeda when they're the ones running them and it's a
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:04.600]  political diversion from all the scandals that the french government has and the u.s government
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:12.120]  has notice the more scandal-ridden a government is the more they're for this because the the the
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:17.080]  french president obama all these guys are just puppets so so they're also cheerleading for it
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:22.040]  because they're being told this will haul your butt out of the fire i mean that's not denied
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.360]  they have all these congress people saying that you've got chris matthew saying that yesterday
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:32.440]  this is outrageous it's it's that's why i'm so angry you think i'd be happy that everything
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.440]  we've talked about is now being admitted for credibility issues i could care less about
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:42.520]  credibility i care about having a future it makes it worse that it's all admitted it's just ridiculous
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:49.720]  how out in the open this all is i need to stop ranting let me just calm down oh come in here
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:56.040]  and try to be calm sometimes i just carry saying it's our fault if anybody gets killed now when
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:04.280]  they started this whole thing i mean it's not an act by the way when i'm doing this on air i
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:14.760]  cannot be angry anymore i've been so angry i'm so angry that i'm just really having trouble doing
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:20.040]  this radio show i'm having trouble working on obama deception too i'm having trouble messing
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:25.880]  with all the other little side issues that going around here because it's like it's like all these
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:30.360]  people not my crew but just the general public are just going on about their business talking about
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:36.280]  the nfl and stuff and it's like the whole world's going to hell in a handbasket these are the type
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:41.000]  of things that happen before a world war before world war one before world war two all the different
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.280]  sides are lining up all the same i've studied so much history and and that's why all the other
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:51.480]  historians are freaking out because folks it's in the air okay i mean horrible stuffs in the air
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:59.640]  and the good news is people sense that not just intellectually but people sense that
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:07.400]  somebody's you know they're having 500 to one phone calls 498 to two phone calls these congress
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:23.960]  people are marking this down you've got 500 to one 500 to one 500 to one against all this
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:32.520]  now scroll down more in the article to the 500 to one there it is 523 to four
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:42.360]  oh man all right i said i'd go to your calls i want your take on all this gene in florida
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:49.240]  you're on the air go ahead um okay first alex i do believe there's a definite possibility of
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:55.960]  another false flag but isn't it possible too that we've already had the false flag and i think this
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:04.440]  may be the real thing here that they will do this and strike Damascus and Damascus to be leveled
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  yeah i mean my gut tells me they're going to pull something like another chemical
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.320]  or they'll launch a missile out of syria and say Assad didn't hit israel well do you remember
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:21.960]  how you you were saying that you feel in your gut something's going to happen on 9 11
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:30.760]  i i'm i'm with you on that i definitely think something is going to happen on 9 11 and also
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:37.640]  because of that 9 11 is considered to be the first day of creation according to the Hebrew
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:43.240]  calendar the Hebrews and the egyptian caustics so every yeah we had callers asking why 9 11 is
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.120]  such a big day for the new world order you're right and that's why they chose 9 11 as you call
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:53.080]  the government it helps you you've got the two towers they're the two pillars it it gets into
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.960]  Babylon miss your religion egyptian egyptian stuff i just i don't get into all that because
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:03.320]  i don't think our new listeners can handle all that but go ahead oh well don't you i think it's
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:07.400]  about time our new listeners start because i don't think we're going to have a choice here pretty
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:14.040]  soon the satanic side is definitely rearing its ugly head and when you can see all of this uh
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:20.280]  uh 9 11 is showing up over and over and over i i do believe you're right about something happening
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:27.080]  on 9 11 if you take oklahoma city you take and you add the date when you're through with it that
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:32.600]  comes to 11 we know i mean i mean number one look look at april 19th april 20th is like
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:37.720]  ha holy days and satanic rituals and and yeah look at all that's happened on april 19th
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:42.600]  i mean over and over and yeah there's certain dates in history and even historians have meant
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:47.640]  that where big things happen look i'm just saying look at how Benghazi happened on 9 11
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.800]  here's a couple of things that i think you you and your listeners might find interesting
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:16:01.160]  when i just said oklahoma city the date it adds up to 11 the date on laco adds up tonight
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:07.800]  okay so we have two major events there that are pointing towards
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:15.240]  11 the portfolio spill when you add up the date you have nine and you had 11 lives lost
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:23.080]  so i think we're definitely going on to something here and another thing i wanted to add to you
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:29.400]  you were talking about Fukushima nuclear earlier here in the united states we have a plan called
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:38.920]  Palo Verde and it's out in arizona we have three reactors there there is no water source except
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:44.840]  for the wastewater from phoenix and this whole thing is considered to be on the 33rd degree
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:50.120]  parallel and it's i'm not sure i don't have to tell you about the 33rd degree parallel but as
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:56.200]  far as everybody else out there um there is a lot happening on the 33rd degree parallel
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:01.560]  damascus is on the 33rd degree parallel beirut is on absolutely the the globalists admit they
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:07.000]  build their their their cities on these key parallels and it doesn't mean it's even real
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.920]  they believe in it believe me i've been to bohemian grove they believe in it thank you for the call
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:16.200]  i snuck into bohemian grove the only press reporter in modern times there's been a few
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:21.160]  employees that got video out of it and by the way i wouldn't advise employees to shoot video we've
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:26.680]  learned that anybody that signs an agreement with them and then releases video gets set up and put
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:32.840]  in present i've known two people that's happened to the globalists have weird rules i was able to
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:39.480]  sneak in get out the only reporter to ever do it they broke into our mail three times to steal it
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:43.720]  when it was going to the media i got some death threats but i was okay because i didn't make any
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:50.280]  agreements before i snuck in there in fact if you notice whenever i confront um the presidential
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:57.160]  advisor to five administrations uh david gergen saw him at the r and c talked to him he said you
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:01.320]  made an agreement not to talk about that i went no i didn't he goes oh you're the one that crashed
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:10.200]  it he gets so angry and that whole fake act to be a nice guy leaves him oh it doesn't even
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:17.960]  matter i don't want to get off all into it the point is is that um i was there with the initiates
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:24.040]  as they watched it and they took it deadly serious when these old men were were were literally crazed
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:31.400]  while they did the mock effigy of burning a child let's go to christ in new york christ

[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:52.520]  in region three on the east coast and um this article from the sleuth journal is basically
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:58.760]  talking about how un peacekeepers began training the fourth week of july and will complete their

[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:45.160]  or they just show up in california and take somebody's gun saying their semi auto they're
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:51.800]  illegal even though the person bought them legally and lawfully at a gun show i mean it's it's it's
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:58.760]  it's being done under federal grants and i know that a law was passed and signed by george w
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:03.080]  bush something positive we could say because of pressure because of the gun confiscations in
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:08.520]  katrina in new orleans and i know that gunners of america spearheaded getting that amendment
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:12.680]  passed so i wanted to get larry to tell us about that law that no one seems to know about
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:17.480]  because we get the calls every day people having their guns taken we get sent the the information
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:27.320]  the police won't say why they're taken this is really illegal and i wanted to uh then find out
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:35.720]  from layering uh exactly uh where all this is going so we're getting him on isd and he just
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:41.640]  dropped off when we get him back on uh we will uh we will we will go to larry pratt uh let's go
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:49.960]  ahead and talk to chris um in new york uh chris uh what's your take on false flags and what may be
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:56.760]  staged um well like i was saying earlier definitely seems like uh fema is preparing for
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:03.960]  something maybe uh merce coronavirus outbreak or something like that and uh it definitely seems
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:08.840]  like you know they're going to use this false flag as a distraction from syria so that they
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:14.840]  can go ahead with their plans there seems like the globalists are very set on attacking syria
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:20.760]  iran and the rest of them over there so it definitely seems like another false flag's coming
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:28.920]  um also an unrelated note uh it's becoming harder and harder to buy ammo in new york state um a
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:35.000]  friend of mine basically has a nine millimeter carbine that was bought perfectly legally and now
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.280]  when he goes to buy a nine millimeter ammo they tell him that he has to show a police id or a permit
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:46.600]  well that's right all over the country that's why i want to get larry pratt on by by fiat
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:51.720]  they're not selling you ammo or they're or they're putting down your license or
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:57.640]  the feds are visiting people that buy even 500 rounds of ammo it's all to create the perception
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:06.920]  you're criminal you're bad that's how authoritarianism begins uh gold mines are getting rated without
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:12.120]  warrants and then they go we just came in black uniforms armored vehicles just to talk to you
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.560]  you're not against us talking to you are you that's in the news today and people are like well
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.480]  what's with the armored vehicles and stuff what do you got a problem with that i mean it's it's all
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:28.520]  about just being occupied and also getting all their goons uh basically accustomed to all of that
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:34.840]  so yes uh but i will dig up the news articles on that later in the next segment and get into the
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:44.200]  fema region um three uh mass drills uh that are taking place uh on the west coast and yeah
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:51.400]  they're announcing riot police a national guard uh you know preparing for a disaster and they're
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:56.200]  calling it a drill but they've never had drills like this they've had little mini drills where
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:03.720]  they'll shut down a highway or uh run a checkpoint or and then tell people it's real but just more
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:08.120]  and more it's the acclimation that's what all the military drills are about and again a lot of this
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:14.520]  is about foreign military operations because again they'll use the foreign military operation to bring
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:20.040]  in the crisis to then say you can't ask questions here all this is happening and then they can get
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:24.680]  their gun confiscation through then they can have the bank holiday in the bail in where you got to
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:31.240]  pay money to goldman sacks and jp morgan in bank of america and wells fargo this has all been done
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:38.920]  in other areas over and over and over again this is how tyrants not just the globalist here but
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:46.920]  communists in the past and and fascists and other authoritarians they use wars and domestic crises to
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:52.360]  do this because then you're in control of everything the globalists just don't want to take over the
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:57.640]  other sovereign nations that are left not saying iran's good or siri is good i don't like any of
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:02.360]  these big governments they're all out of control but it's the globalists that are here in america
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:07.400]  that are taking all of my rights it's the globalist that are here in america
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:12.840]  that are taking all of my liberties it's the globalist here that are assaulting the family
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:21.160]  and assaulting homeschoolers and and assaulting us with gmo and assaulting us uh with all these other
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:32.360]  things that's what's going on that's what's happening here and as a culture as a society
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:37.240]  we need to realize we're occupied by the new world order and they're very bad people
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:43.480]  and they want to make us poor by design so that we can be controlled as a permanent peasant class

[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:46.040]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live and we do have larry pratt ahead of gunners of america
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:53.320]  gun owners dot org on the isd in line with us to talk about the law that no one seems to know about
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:58.760]  saying the feds or local police cannot confiscate your guns without a warrant or without the uh
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:05.320]  specifics but all over the country they're taking legal lawful guns we see the articles every two
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:09.320]  days or so where somebody puts a gun in their car to go to the shooting range a neighbor sees
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:14.440]  that cops come the guns legal they still take it i had two people walking to me this week on the
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:22.120]  street who have property outside austin in one case it's a hundred acres they're shooting totally
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:29.240]  legal the cops came and said it's still an aggressive display still frighten people
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:35.000]  terroristic carrying the gunshots we're taking your guns you're going to jail that's in texas folks
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:40.440]  you can't shoot on a hundred acre farm okay i mean the middle of nowhere when mills the police
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:45.800]  are coming so it's all part of this intimidation under federal grants of gun owners and i want
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:49.720]  to people to know about the legal teeth that larry pratt and gunners of america
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:53.800]  helped get in place what was it five years ago how long ago did that law get passed sir
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:35:01.960]  it was following hurricane katrina and louisiana was ground zero for gun confiscation and precisely
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:07.400]  the time when people needed their guns the most the cops were coming around to take them
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:15.400]  and the problem is they knew where the guns were they knew who had the guns because they'd
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:20.600]  gone to the gun stores compile the list from the purchase records that are required to be kept
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:25.960]  by the federal government unconstitutionally and they knew exactly where to go to make their
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:34.680]  surgical strikes now the as a result of that david vidder senator from louisiana got enacted a law
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:42.120]  that keeps the federales from doing that and a couple of states also did the same after a disaster
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:47.960]  you cannot go and grab people's guns but let's look at a couple of things it means that
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:53.480]  whether they have a centralized registry or not and i would argue they do but whether they do or
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:59.640]  not effectively there is a gun registry all it takes is a little extra shoe leather and
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:05.720]  they can go to the various gun stores of an area and they'll have a list of almost everybody
[02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:11.800]  that has a gun unless somebody bought a gun or got a gun as a gift from dad or a neighbor or
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:17.960]  something like that it's going to be a matter of record and that's why we fought so hard
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:26.200]  against the to me bill because it was going to expand to private transactions the requirement
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:31.720]  that a background check be done and after the nsa scandal has broken i don't think too many people
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:37.960]  are going to doubt they're not going to suspect that i'm paranoid by maintaining that of course
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:42.840]  the federal government has illegally kept a record of gun owners alex if they want to know
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:48.440]  what you're saying to aunt susie on the telephone don't you think they might want a list of the
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:55.480]  guns even more well it's gun owners of america of course uh that's helped push the nra as even um
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:01.400]  you know folks on our show have talked about who are nra board members it it has been gun owners
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:06.760]  of america as ted newton has said that it's helped push the nra to be more hardcore what do you make
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:13.400]  of the hill article today nra joins acl lawsuit claims nsa starting gun registry well it came out
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:19.720]  that the dea has access to it along with 2000 corporations they're all spying on us they're
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:28.440]  all spying on us and it is just so absolutely out of control that we've got to get the house to act
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:34.920]  the house can do something that would be effective the house was given by the founders this body that's
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:41.720]  elected every two years and therefore hopefully is the closest to the people they can simply say
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:48.760]  none of these funds may be used for and then fill in the blank now what we're most concerned about
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:56.040]  at the very moment is that by the end of the month there will have to be a continuing resolution
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:03.080]  passed by the congress this will continue the funding of the congress pretty much at the level
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:11.480]  of the previous fiscal year but the fight has to be made over defunding obama care the republicans
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:19.560]  in the house have to originate a continuing resolution that specifically defunds the implementation
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:26.280]  and operation of obama care if they do that the senate may or may not concur and the president
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:34.440]  might veto the bill if the senate did concur but here's the deal that would mean that the government
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:40.840]  would no longer be able to operate by borrowing they could only operate on what tax revenues
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:45.720]  are coming in well that's 57 percent of what they are spending in other words they borrow
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:54.760]  43 percent every day every month throughout the year the government would certainly not stop operating
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:39:00.840]  the social security checks which are mechanized and digitized anyway could continue going out
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:06.120]  without probably the presence of a human being because it's all programs and computers so some
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:12.520]  of those so-called essential functions of federal government would not be affected only if somebody
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:17.720]  is diabolical as our president were to issue an order saying oh we don't have the money to run
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.480]  the electricity for the computers that are generating the social security checks so therefore
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:26.440]  they're not going to be able to go out does that sound preposterous well think of some of the other
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:31.320]  things the president has done when given a choice he'll kick you right where it hurts the worst
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:39.080]  so we think that the fight has to be made the republicans have to realize that they some of
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:47.080]  their leaders have been peddling a lie starting with john bainer they say well listen to remember
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:51.960]  what happened in 1995 when we shut the government down under clinton well once again the government
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:58.760]  didn't shut down it slowed down and yes i do remember what happened i was here and i remember
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:05.960]  that the polls were in favor of the republicans until gingrich went wobbly and started to cave in
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:11.720]  and of course he's an establishment cfr guy he played that perfectly and then betrayed the contract
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:17.560]  absolutely but the climate today is even more hardcore yes i want to shift gears now with you
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:22.280]  larry pratt head of governors of america if you just joined us to the geopolitical i know you've
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:28.920]  traveled the world and have been involved advising congress on events for decades and now the world
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:32.600]  is waking up to what you and i've been talking about for two and a half years our government under
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:39.480]  obama had been gauzy a year ago september 11th but but before that funding al-qaeda to overthrow
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:46.280]  libya trying to overthrow syria trying to overthrow our ally mubarak in egypt now the military speaking
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:52.520]  out now you've got the ted cruise saying our military is not the air force for al-qaeda that's a
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:59.560]  quote you've got a very good phrase by the way that is really spot on what's happening absolutely so
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:06.520]  now that you've got a rand paul rand paul now that you've got pat you can and now that you've got
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:12.040]  matt drudge coming out i've never seen real conservatives libertarian types really shine
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:17.400]  like this i'm very proud the warmongering left of course loves it but now you've even got pelosi
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:24.680]  saying the left's turning against him obama admits a slime ball a matthew's admits that this is to
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:30.680]  haul his butt out of the fire so they're not even denying it and the flop flopping of it's a red line
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:35.640]  we never said red liner we don't need boots on the ground yes we do i believe republicans cave on
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:42.840]  this this is something where the polls i've seen 80 percent of our fellow americans think it's nuts
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:49.160]  to go into syria we have no discernible national interest in that country whatsoever
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:55.080]  yet it's horrible what's happening but just as bad as the government is behaving to its enemy so
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:42:00.040]  the al-qaeda opposition is behaving to the government oh they're clearly worse it's it's all
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:07.400]  terrible and uh but you're right the al-qaeda guys are worse they're more aggressive uh
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:13.640]  asad is happy to just butcher his own people he's not looking for foreign conquest he's not a threat
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:21.000]  to the united states why in the world are we bothering him why well i i knew the answer to
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  my question it's because the president has uniformly supported the worst of the worst
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:33.560]  wars every chance he got al-qaeda muslim brotherhood over mubarak same thing in tunisia
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:41.880]  and now we're seeing it played out again in syria the guy is not naive the guy is not incompetent
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:47.880]  he's doing exactly what he intends to do which is to diminish the the ability of the united
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:54.280]  states to operate in the world scene and to pull us down many pegs i really know that what you're
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:58.440]  saying is true now and i was even in doubt of this a few years ago because why would the establishment
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:03.480]  allow america to be so damaged they're globalists they want to move everything to china they want
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:09.320]  to move it more towards the eu uh they they're they're shutting down our power plants our gold
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:16.360]  mines everything they do is to wreck america they really do hate america and even if they run it
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:21.560]  they'll run in the ground to get at middle america and the and the and the bitter clingers but let me
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:27.160]  bring this up to you larry pratt let me ask you this question i see this is a collapse though that
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:33.080]  you have the left and right coming together against this war some polls like reuters nine percent
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:40.280]  support the war congress is saying they're getting 500 to two 500 to one uh calls against the war
[02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:46.280]  versus pro and nobody's believing obama and now his support's draining in congress i see this is
[02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:53.160]  almost a chelchescu moment well we haven't gotten there yet because we've got democrats saying well
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:59.000]  yes i know my folks are against it but uh i've got to go with my president on this one in other
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:07.560]  words his reputation bailing him out of his own muck is more important to them so far than what the
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:14.280]  people are saying back home now i've never seen numbers like the ones you just pointed to uh 500
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:21.320]  to two is stunning uh that means there's hardly anybody in the country with a brain that thinks
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:28.040]  we ought to be in syria and if they go in anyway and if the republicans like baner who i think is
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:34.600]  compromised and that's why he folds like a suit i could go into that too we have time uh i think
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:42.120]  he's going to fold on this and the question will be how many in the caucus that almost revolted
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:46.600]  against him when he was reelected how many of them are going to say that's it john we're not going
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.040]  with you well they're already men they don't have the votes let me give you the headlines it's uh
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:54.520]  weekly standard first broke yesterday now more numbers are out world net daily we're the latest
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:45:00.360]  in about 30 minutes going up on info wars dot com there's more info out congress calls to congress
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:06.520]  499 to one against syrian wars the world net daily headline then they have the press releases by
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:16.360]  20 members of congress about the calls they're getting 100 to 1 uh 99 to 1 523 to 4 uh you know
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:25.000]  because they keep a tally uh 1000 calls to my office five are for the war uh that's republican
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:31.560]  out of west virginia shelby uh this is this is what they're saying uh republican and democrats
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:40.520]  are getting 100 to 1 125 to 1 it's it's it's 99 plus percent against it larry so if the congress
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:50.920]  supports the president on this i think that gives us a wonderful opportunity to see people like
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:58.360]  bevin who's running against mcconnell uh really pick up he's got money he's a wealthy businessman
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:05.320]  and he's got the tea party endorsement they all coalesced behind him which is uncommonly smart
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:12.520]  for people on our side kudos to the people in kentucky uh you've got three uh substantial
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:19.320]  conservatives running against lindsay grahamnesty uh there might be other conservative challengers
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:26.120]  now come out against these pathetic republicans and take them on in the primaries well that was
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:29.800]  my next question you've got a really i'm not kissing your hand it's just true for folks that
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:34.520]  are just out tuning in larry pratt's got his ear really to the ground there in dc the word i get
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:40.440]  and what i see happening is actually a libertarian revolution taking over the republican party all
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:46.120]  the stars are real libertarians all the stars are are anti-fraudulent war all the stars are
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:52.040]  pro-constitution pro-gun the old republicans are running the others are you know are compromised
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:58.200]  as you said clearly with with blackmail and nsa garbage uh the nra is growing backbone i mean
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:06.040]  i see a american revolution happening that'll make what barry goalwater tried to do look tame
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:13.320]  and also there's a lot of conservative people of faith primarily evangelicals but also catholics
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:20.600]  and jews who are really i think more stirred up than they were in 2010 uh hey we sent you guys
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:25.880]  there to fix the problem and it sure kind of looks like you're part of the problem now yourself
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:32.680]  well said in closing larry pratt uh what do you expect to happen in 2014 currently unless
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:36.760]  obama gets a big war which will up the democratic party's ratings they believe i don't think that's
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:43.000]  gonna work this time but i mean i i think we're gonna see a tea party uh surge in the house
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:48.120]  what do you see i think so and if the republicans support the president there's going to be primary
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:56.440]  action galore i think if they vote for a continuing resolution that refunds obama care uh i think that
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:03.560]  would stoke the fires even more because this is a real absolutely valid opportunity to kill
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:10.200]  obama care by the end of the month to to put in that continuing resolution no funds to be used
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:16.680]  for obama care in any way period paragraph and if they don't do those two things which are
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:24.440]  are absolutely red hot button issues then i i think some of these incumbents are in for some
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:30.840]  rude surprises well said larry pratt thank you so much for spending time with us last 60 second
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:37.560]  comment uh the examiner out of washington is carrying this story dc cops under orders for
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:42.680]  arrest tourists with empty bullet cases you can bind 711 you know the necklace that's an empty
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:48.280]  bullet casing and they've been given the order to harass and grab as many visitors as they can
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:53.880]  dc won't let little kids videotape to capital i've been in there what's wrong with the dc police
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:59.240]  they're like something out of north korea well they have a woman i'm pretty sure liberal police
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:05.400]  chief and uh you know it starts from the top uh the council hires uh the kind of chief they want
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:11.640]  and she's very politically correct and i don't know that this really reflects the way many of
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:16.760]  the officers feel but they will be told to follow orders if they want to continue working there
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.880]  so if you're wearing a bullet casing around your neck or it's on your key ring the cops
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:25.400]  going to follow orders and take you to jail for something that's been thrown out of the supreme
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:31.080]  court even if it was a real bullet i mean i i i i mean it's incredible it's incredible well

[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:15.080]  government drills before it's been going on since the 40s when the cold war started up in about 47
[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:20.280]  some say it started when the atomic bombs got dropped on hereshima and nakasaki
[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:25.400]  in japan but now when they have these drills i've been to them we've had reporters on that
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:31.080]  have been to them i mean these aren't drills they set up checkpoints they search everybody
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:36.600]  and this is a multi-state fema region three what is that five states
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:44.280]  five states and the new york times says his worries over the power grid rise yeah because
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:49.000]  they're turning off so many of our power plants i love how they always oh we don't know why the
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:55.960]  power is going on all the time a drill will simulate a knockout blow and all the big power
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:54:59.800]  commissions told him he turned off hundreds of power plants we're gonna have blackouts people
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:04.120]  are gonna go bankrupt so now they go we've got to have a martial law drill because of the power grid
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:10.440]  as the electric grid as government and private experts describe it is the glass jaw of american
[02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:15.800]  industry that's why they spend all their time sabotaging it if an adversary lands a knockout
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:20.200]  blow the globalists that run us this is the adversary telling us about themselves they fear
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:26.680]  it could black out vast areas of the continent for weeks interrupting that could be the false
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:33.960]  flag folks interrupt supplies of water gasoline diesel fuel and fresh food shut down communications
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:38.760]  and create disruptions on a scale that was only hinted at by hurricane sandy in the tax of 911
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:42.840]  that's why thousands of utility workers business executives that's in for guard
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:50.200]  national guard officers fbi anti-terrorism experts and other officials from government
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:55.880]  agencies in the united states canada and mexico oh they're going to be there helping
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:03.480]  are preparing for an emergency drill in november that runs right in to october
[02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:07.800]  that will simulate physical attacks and cyber attacks that could take down large sections
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:11.880]  of the power grid and they're actually putting cyber security in to shut all this down so they
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:17.560]  can and this is probably just a test of how to shut us down i mean all i mean that's on record
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:21.800]  the globalists put a grid in to take over all the radio tv shut down all the power plants
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:26.680]  shut down all the private power plants all the city on power plants just in total this is the
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:31.480]  occupation force and now they're they're going oh we're checking for saboteurs well they're the
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:37.720]  saboteurs and you can go to the n-e-r-c north american electric reliability corporation report
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:43.560]  uh on part of this grid they're going to have riot police out checkpoints uh all over the east
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:50.600]  coast uh all the way into west virginia so uh be sure and enjoy that uh callers were asking
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:55.320]  if it's real i i get we get emails calls every couple minutes basically here at the office about
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:57:02.520]  this and you know what i'll get i'll do a whole report tomorrow sometime in the three hours
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:09.320]  on this drill and probably nothing's going to happen the point is is that this is a takeover
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:15.400]  drill just like everything else is so uh we'll uh and by the way you know we told you they were

[03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:49.160]  you've been one guy the one person in this country who's been so stentorian in your views
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:55.720]  against this whole um uh false flag operation your analysis has been trenchant and thorough
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:01:03.560]  and you've it is because of your unstinting uh commitment to the truth and and and and i think
[03:01:04.280 --> 03:01:11.000]  and and people better um listen to you i know you have a great audience around the world
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:19.720]  but what you do is really in the in in the interest of humanity and thank you just a quick point please
[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:28.600]  you know i i hope we can uh apply a full full full court press and and and and emphasize
[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:33.640]  that this is a false flag and if this is the nation that talks about democracy ad nauseam
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:38.040]  then are they going to listen to the overwhelming number of people who are against this
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:45.240]  how big a deal do you think it is to have 500 to one people calling congress against this i mean
[03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:52.760]  that tells me america is actually waking up well it's going to boil over if these if these
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:02:00.280]  politicians don't listen to us and and uh and you know the one area you've also really excelled in
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:07.160]  is appealing to the arm services people when they start sharing those placards and as those numbers
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:13.880]  swell then we've reached the tipping point my friend i agree with you and then they've got
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:20.040]  these movie star women out there pushing the war trying to use sex to sell war it's so sick
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:26.120]  well i don't take any more of your time thank you so much for the courtesy and you are a great
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:32.440]  human being first and and a great american well you're very sweet sir but i just try to i just
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:37.400]  want to survive and uh half the time i'm just burned out and exhausted and it's unlistensable
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:42.280]  but you know what i'm trying to tell the truth and so if god's with us who can be against us i
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:47.320]  think it comes down to that in the final equation let's talk to bruce in canada bruce you're on

[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:13.400]  term false flag itself and how it's uh seems to be breaking into the mainstream media bit and how
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:17.960]  important i think that is uh i mean the reason i think it's important is when i first heard about
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:23.240]  you in 2005 uh you were talking about that a lot and you were explaining what it is it's a military
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:31.720]  tactic cia tactic and uh we're citing uh references about how this has had uh been the case how these
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:37.720]  have been pulled off by historically now the other day i heard denis kasanich uh actually used the
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:44.760]  word itself uh when he was asked about uh what happened in syria and uh he actually used the
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:50.360]  term false flag oh yeah ron paul's using it pat bue canons using it rush calls it frame up
