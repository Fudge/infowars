[00:57.960 --> 01:02.160]  about all the different economic developments that have taken place
[01:02.160 --> 01:09.200]  Rob Dew who I sent out of town last minute Tuesday night was the producer
[01:09.200 --> 01:14.400]  that set up Dave Mustaine and he'll probably be on today they said they
[01:14.400 --> 01:18.160]  were he was excited to come on but we may have had some scheduling snafus we

[01:38.080 --> 01:43.960]  got more congressman coming up next week probably Grayson again just
[01:43.960 --> 01:49.920]  incredibly important radio show every day it gets more intense here is what
[01:49.920 --> 01:55.320]  we have on our plate Barack Obama and the mainstream corporate media and
[01:55.320 --> 02:01.280]  Israel and England are all beating the drum that Iran now has secret nuclear
[02:01.280 --> 02:07.280]  facilities and weapons same lie they used seven years ago on Iraq they are
[02:07.280 --> 02:10.760]  now pushing it big time even though the CIA's own report says that they were
[02:10.760 --> 02:14.880]  left alone to do whatever they wanted it would still be another seven years till
[02:14.880 --> 02:20.440]  they got a primitive a bomb of course the US helped give Pakistan nukes but
[02:20.440 --> 02:24.440]  nobody's worried about that this is just a pretext to attack Iran over their
[02:24.440 --> 02:28.680]  oil supply and notice that right as they're beating the drums and right as
[02:28.680 --> 02:35.520]  Israel saying they're getting ready to strike Iran as early as the winter 2009
[02:35.520 --> 02:42.160]  into the end of winter 2010 anytime the next four to five months notice that
[02:42.160 --> 02:47.520]  suddenly they have bomb plots they foiled in Dallas Texas and also in
[02:47.520 --> 02:51.600]  Illinois and then it turned out they've charged some people in New York with
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.240]  lying to federal officials they can't even charge them with terrorism it's
[02:55.240 --> 02:59.480]  come out over and over again that they framed people set people up the modus
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.560]  operandi with the 93 World Trade Center bombing as the FBI cooked the bomb
[03:04.560 --> 03:11.720]  train the drivers the group was led by a federal informant who then said thought
[03:11.720 --> 03:14.520]  that they were setting him up that it wasn't a sting if they were really gonna
[03:14.520 --> 03:18.480]  bomb the building he recorded the FBI and gave a press conference on the
[03:18.480 --> 03:22.760]  courthouse steps releasing the tapes to the media it's in the New York Times the
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.040]  FBI cooked a bomb train the drivers through a mod salon and he blew the
[03:27.040 --> 03:36.120]  whistle on them and remember in 2006 in the Florida Miami reported bombings with
[03:36.120 --> 03:39.480]  Muslim black extremists turned out they weren't Muslims they were Christians
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.760]  they were street kids potheads the FBI gave them hundreds of thousands of
[03:43.760 --> 03:47.920]  dollars rented out a warehouse told them they'll give them more money and more
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.480]  marijuana they dress up and camouflage and make videos and shoot video of the
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.040]  federal building so they were led by a black FBI informant posing as a
[03:58.040 --> 04:02.560]  rastafarian and it's just the same thing with two years ago with the Muslim
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.520]  kids in Toronto and the Royal Mount of Police delivering ammonium nitrate to
[04:06.520 --> 04:12.080]  their door fertilizer this is the exact same thing and notice the feds like to
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.880]  do this in clusters like oh my gosh look there's bomb plots everywhere oh my gosh
[04:15.880 --> 04:20.440]  Iran may be behind it oh my gosh Iran's with al-Qaeda Iran is Shiite the
[04:20.440 --> 04:26.560]  opposite group of the Sunni-based Wahhabi is based on al-Qaeda and actually
[04:26.560 --> 04:30.960]  al-Qaeda mainstream news works for the CIA and is trying to destabilize and
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.960]  attack Iran also hundreds go to Google type in New World Order hundreds of
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.120]  news articles saying a world government the end of the dollar is being formed at
[04:40.120 --> 04:45.120]  the G20 right now and the even bigger more important news military police
[04:45.120 --> 04:50.700]  kidnap G20 protesters shove him into unmarked car and snatch and grab a
[04:50.700 --> 04:54.200]  preliminary viewing the video it looks staged to me will tell you what's

[08:18.400 --> 08:29.240]  from austin texas alex jones world government is openly being announced
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.200]  and formed in front of our very eyes barack obama has engaged in high treason
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.200]  and become the first u.s. president chair the u.n. security council the u.n.
[08:38.200 --> 08:41.640]  security council is the most powerful body the only body with real power in the
[08:41.640 --> 08:48.720]  u.n. the secretary general chairs the general assembly of all the different
[08:48.720 --> 08:55.320]  third world countries that have no power only the g20 finance ministers have
[08:55.320 --> 09:00.200]  the real power in the governmental systems of the nation states but the
[09:00.200 --> 09:05.840]  security council and its rotating 15 member board is the true power in the
[09:05.840 --> 09:14.760]  united nations and president obama has violated article 1 section 9 of the u.s.
[09:14.760 --> 09:20.840]  constitution taking his seat on the rotating board every 15 months he is
[09:20.840 --> 09:25.520]  now saying he will chair it for the month-long duration of the month-long
[09:25.520 --> 09:30.320]  term and he has to swear an oath to the u.n. charter to do that that is in
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.400]  complete contravention to our bill of rights our constitution the declaration
[09:34.400 --> 09:38.840]  of independence and his oath of office we're going to be discussing that i
[09:38.840 --> 09:48.560]  have a huge stack of news here today where they are openly announcing world
[09:48.560 --> 09:57.040]  government the new world order just absolutely amazing we have israel saying
[09:57.040 --> 10:00.400]  they're getting ready to hit iran we see media hype and propaganda about how they
[10:00.400 --> 10:06.000]  have hidden nukes and hidden facilities we're seeing a complete replay of 2002
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.640]  into 2003 with a strike six and a half years ago on iraq we have military
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.400]  police kidnapping g20 protesters not just one but one on video but other
[10:17.400 --> 10:21.400]  confirmed reports anyone that even spoke out against it or videotaped it was
[10:21.400 --> 10:26.880]  then arrested by riot police and drug away this is right out of malice china
[10:26.880 --> 10:35.480]  or soviet russia and then we have the newspaper revitalization act with the
[10:35.480 --> 10:39.240]  rock obama saying he wants it to pass to federalize the major newspapers
[10:39.240 --> 10:42.960]  openly a violation of the first amendment they're taking over the
[10:42.960 --> 10:45.880]  churches to the faith-based initiatives in the clergy response teams are taking
[10:45.880 --> 10:48.960]  over the newspapers they're taking over the auto industry they're taking over
[10:48.960 --> 10:53.280]  the banking industry that they want to take over health care 20% of what's
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.280]  left of the economy you think the insurance companies and hospitals do a
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.440]  sorry job sometimes their their angels compared to the government that's why
[11:02.440 --> 11:05.360]  the insurance companies are actually lobbying in many cases for this
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.440]  government takeover because then they're gonna have liability protection so
[11:09.440 --> 11:27.800]  that is all coming up today as well I also want to get into the fact that
[11:27.800 --> 11:34.600]  these bomb plots in Dallas and in Illinois are classically staged to
[11:34.600 --> 11:44.400]  hype all this iran fear we are also going to get into this piece of
[11:44.400 --> 11:51.240]  propaganda spanking lowers a child's IQ researchers say and we have caught these
[11:51.240 --> 11:54.680]  different government researchers and university researchers will remember the
[11:54.680 --> 12:04.200]  five years ago a big illinois chicago study came out saying that the founding
[12:04.200 --> 12:11.880]  fathers didn't like guns and only 10% of the colonists own guns and then other
[12:11.880 --> 12:16.840]  researchers like John lot the professor went and researched it and found it was
[12:16.840 --> 12:23.280]  all a lie and the professor was disbarred there needs to be an investigation of
[12:23.280 --> 12:30.760]  this study because I'll guarantee you that the higher IQ families lied when
[12:30.760 --> 12:34.400]  they were asked in the survey in the study if they spank their children
[12:34.400 --> 12:37.840]  knowing that it's not illegal to spank your children it's just illegal to hurt
[12:37.840 --> 12:44.800]  them physically and that they would have their children taken and I've seen this
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.720]  in polling science studies when when the media calls up a household and ask the
[12:49.720 --> 12:53.520]  controversial question they found that depending on the question around half of
[12:53.520 --> 12:59.000]  people will lie and go with what they believe the politically correct answer
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.560]  is and the margin of error in the study is more than five percent and so the
[13:06.560 --> 13:10.120]  whole thing is a fraud but it's in the Los Angeles time spanking lowers the
[13:10.120 --> 13:15.040]  child's IQ researchers say being spanked as a child is linked to having a lower
[13:15.040 --> 13:19.400]  IQ according to a study presented today at the International Conference on
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.520]  Violence Abuse and Trauma in San Diego that's a UN NGO sponsored event and
[13:25.520 --> 13:29.760]  again the UN has openly stated hundreds of times they want to end the family
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.240]  they want no authority of the parents over the children and even if you don't
[13:33.240 --> 13:36.960]  spank your children they routinely take them for bruises on their knees of
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.160]  playing in the playground I know parents here in Austin whose children at
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.920]  school fall off a jungle gym and break their finger or arm CPS goes ahead and
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.560]  takes them it just goes children fall off the front porch knock a tooth out
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.360]  something that happened to me they try to take your children your child is it
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.240]  playing in a tree falls out dislocates their shoulder they take them they are
[14:00.240 --> 14:03.120]  hunting your children they're doing everything they can to set the precedent
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.680]  to take them as John P. Holder and White House science are his own government
[14:06.680 --> 14:15.560]  policy textbook states states openly that they want to take basically all
[14:15.560 --> 14:18.880]  children globally and raise them government dormitories China is the
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.400]  model the first country in the last 30 years to attempt this of course they
[14:24.400 --> 14:30.280]  started with 2,000 families now it's 20 plus thousand in England at birth or if
[14:30.280 --> 14:34.240]  you're on welfare or in the government system involved in their secure start
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.720]  they don't call it head start over there that 20,000 homes and growing they want
[14:38.720 --> 14:44.200]  to double it again by next year it'll be 40,000 have cameras in every room in the
[14:44.200 --> 14:47.800]  house in the kitchen in the bedrooms in the bathrooms government bureaucrats
[14:47.800 --> 14:54.120]  watch you 24 7 making you quote eat proper meals go to sleep on time and that
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.320]  you don't raise your voice to your children of course the government can
[14:57.320 --> 15:00.880]  lock them up in little prison cells the government can abuse them can rape them
[15:00.880 --> 15:05.720]  five times more likely in US average is even higher in England for the government
[15:05.720 --> 15:09.800]  to abuse children than any other group but they're all above the law and held
[15:09.800 --> 15:14.080]  to a different lower standard parents are hold held to a bizarre standard of no
[15:14.080 --> 15:19.040]  yelling no spanking no nothing and so the cameras will be going in your homes
[15:19.040 --> 15:22.920]  Houston police chief two years ago called for cameras and everyone's homes in
[15:22.920 --> 15:27.120]  Houston they are now taking warrantless checkpoints taking blood at
[15:27.120 --> 15:37.480]  checkpoints it just goes on and on and on and on everywhere with the different
[15:37.480 --> 15:45.120]  things that they are doing I sound a bit distracted here I had a giant stack on
[15:45.120 --> 15:54.520]  my desk with about 15 articles or so that I printed up where the mainstream
[15:54.520 --> 16:02.520]  media is calling for world government I also had a print up here of all of my
[16:02.520 --> 16:15.200]  YouTube clips that I was going to be playing now that's not it that's the
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.120]  YouTube stack oh it doesn't matter we can go to Google and type in New World
[16:20.120 --> 16:24.560]  Order and they're all print up I have two of them here USA Today Obama set stage
[16:24.560 --> 16:31.720]  for New World Order Obama now president of the world I've got all of that the
[16:31.720 --> 16:34.440]  producers have begged me to clean the desk off every day but end up doing it
[16:34.440 --> 16:37.720]  about every week there's literally probably a thousand or more articles
[16:37.720 --> 16:43.400]  sitting here on my stack Sarkozy's called for a new order basically every
[16:43.400 --> 16:47.560]  world leader we know of Gordon Brown Sarkozy the Brazilian president they've
[16:47.560 --> 16:53.800]  all called for a new order and they've described what that new world order is
[16:53.800 --> 17:02.880]  and they say it's a banking dictatorship over the planet the only person the
[17:02.880 --> 17:11.680]  only world leader to slam it was the president of the Czech Republic Vakhov
[17:11.680 --> 17:16.240]  Klaus and he slammed global government and said we don't want global
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.640]  governance that it will ruin our society and I've got that in my stack from
[17:21.640 --> 17:30.840]  Wednesday this is very bizarre but I will no doubt find it during the break I
[17:30.840 --> 17:35.560]  had it when I started the show but we're gonna go over all of this today one of
[17:35.560 --> 17:44.120]  the other huge huge huge huge issues that we're going to be covering today is
[17:44.120 --> 17:52.720]  military police kidnapped G20 protester shove him into unmarked car and this is
[17:52.720 --> 17:59.040]  on video now we've got scores I mean scores of videos of police coming up to
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.280]  women doing nothing and Billy clubbing them in the head or tackling them for
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.000]  some reason they love to attack women we've got video of the sound cannons
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.320]  firing at people that is right out of a sci-fi nightmare sci-fi dystopic movie
[18:12.320 --> 18:17.720]  black armored vehicles police and military police and black uniforms
[18:17.720 --> 18:21.560]  broadcasting this is an unlawful assembly you must disperse and then
[18:21.560 --> 18:25.480]  firing rubber bullets and beanbags at people and tear gas and sound cannons
[18:25.480 --> 18:30.960]  and then military just pulling up in unmarked cars jumping out in military
[18:30.960 --> 18:35.080]  uniforms and grabbing peaceful protesters and slamming them into cars and
[18:35.080 --> 18:40.840]  dragging them away but I see the officers the military men smiling and we
[18:40.840 --> 18:46.160]  saw this in Ottawa in 2008 at the SPP security prosperity partnership summit
[18:46.160 --> 18:52.120]  and it did and I said that's fake that is a provocateur staging stuff for the
[18:52.120 --> 18:57.640]  media and then the police stage arrest of them and well it will probably end up
[18:57.640 --> 19:00.880]  getting contacted by the person and some people listen to the show if they're
[19:00.880 --> 19:05.880]  not a fed but preliminarily I will give you the preliminary judgment this is
[19:05.880 --> 19:13.840]  staged now why would they be staging the arrest again unmarked champagne crown
[19:13.840 --> 19:21.000]  Vic pulls up three military MPs pile out they grab the guy and it looks like the
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.080]  urban warfare drills I've been to where they hire actors to scream and yell and
[19:25.080 --> 19:32.280]  say oh no not the camp why would they be staging snatching grabs now it may be
[19:32.280 --> 19:35.960]  real either way it's bad they're either training everybody to accept snatching
[19:35.960 --> 19:39.440]  grabs of military or it really happened and the reports are pouring in that know
[19:39.440 --> 19:44.240]  the military is arresting people for no reason but this looks stage now I can't
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.640]  play the audio so I have to go to it once we go live at prison planet TV and
[19:47.640 --> 19:51.480]  I'll talk over it with play-by-play because there's so much profanity as

[29:26.680 --> 29:31.040]  cannon hitting him hard because the cops have been trained zero tolerance the
[29:31.040 --> 29:35.840]  city code under Pennsylvania Patriot Act that's what they call it there says

[34:50.040 --> 34:54.680]  ago when he got going his father talk about a devil is looking guy with his
[34:54.680 --> 34:58.280]  big beard you can pull up the Rockefeller family history online look at
[34:58.280 --> 35:02.600]  him he was a snake oil salesman that made a whole bunch of money sell an
[35:02.600 --> 35:08.440]  opium as a cure all in bottles and then he was the first snake oil salesman to
[35:08.440 --> 35:13.560]  not just send out a wagon himself and go town to town he thought I'll franchise
[35:13.560 --> 35:17.560]  this I'll have warehouses all over the east and the west as the railroads
[35:17.560 --> 35:24.240]  expanded and he thought of branding and banners and the name of his company and
[35:24.240 --> 35:29.800]  he sent out thousands of wagons on the trains to go to even the smallest town
[35:29.800 --> 35:37.000]  selling snake oil and they made tens of millions of dollars in 1840s 50s and
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.120]  60s money and then when he died he gave John D every centella of it and John D
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.560]  struck oil and created a monopoly over that with standard oil and John D then
[35:47.560 --> 35:52.720]  hired Pickerton security to go out to small towns where people set up gold
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.040]  mines and they would walk in blow the sheriff's head off kill the mayor burn
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.280]  the town down and bring in different mercenary forces now that's who set up
[36:02.280 --> 36:08.040]  the new world order they sent out wagons with opium and they got everybody
[36:08.040 --> 36:12.560]  addicted to drugs and they got filthy rich off that and then they went out and
[36:12.560 --> 36:16.560]  took the gold mines and took the coal mines and they went out at gunpoint and
[36:16.560 --> 36:20.680]  took the silver mines and they went out and took over the oil fields and they
[36:20.680 --> 36:27.120]  rule this planet with the Queen of England and the Rothschilds period because
[36:27.120 --> 36:33.000]  John D's daddy I forget his name give me a favor pull up John D Rockefeller the
[36:33.000 --> 36:40.440]  first father it'll pull up I forget his name John D Rockefeller's father I
[36:40.440 --> 36:43.600]  forget his name we go live at prison planet on TV next hour we'll have that
[36:43.600 --> 36:46.680]  and have his name for after the name escapes you at the time but that's the
[36:46.680 --> 36:49.440]  history of it I've studied it read several books on it and it's on the
[36:49.440 --> 36:54.520]  Rockefeller's own family website I've got a PBS documentary about the Rockefellers
[36:54.520 --> 36:59.320]  made 15 their years ago or so I guess early 90s more than that now and they
[36:59.320 --> 37:05.240]  just brag about the whole thing and all the famous cases you ever seen that
[37:05.240 --> 37:12.360]  Clint Eastwood movie it's not High Plains Drifter but it's a similar one it's the
[37:12.360 --> 37:18.120]  one where he goes into little town and the local gold mining company brings in
[37:18.120 --> 37:21.920]  the regulators to start killing all the gold miners who won't hand over their
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.640]  land that is based on a whole bunch of true stories they did that in Oklahoma
[37:26.640 --> 37:31.520]  and Colorado they did that in Texas they did that in California and they just
[37:31.520 --> 37:34.720]  walk right up to little kids and put a gun right to their head in a famous case
[37:34.720 --> 37:38.640]  in Colorado that happened in the last century they came into a gold mining
[37:38.640 --> 37:43.080]  town wrote down the families burned it down shot little kids in the back killed
[37:43.080 --> 37:50.240]  hundreds there's just too many cases of this and that's all they are they're
[37:50.240 --> 37:56.000]  they're they're snake oil salesman that took that money and then learned how to
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.720]  create monopolies and learned how to hire mercenaries and what are they doing
[37:59.720 --> 38:02.640]  today with the mercenaries with black water and all the rest of these
[38:02.640 --> 38:06.960]  companies what are they doing to our nation what have they turned us into they
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.720]  own the private prisons they own the banks that launder the drug money they
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.600]  control the conduits that ship the drugs in they own it and run it and
[38:15.600 --> 38:22.120]  dominate it all and if you look at David Rockefeller he has funded hundreds of
[38:22.120 --> 38:30.040]  groups calling for world government he makes George Soros look like a small
[38:30.040 --> 38:34.680]  time amateur at running groups and Soros funds hundreds of groups on record
[38:34.680 --> 38:42.560]  billions and billions a year and this is how they dominate our planet this is
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.680]  how they operate this is how they get their job done and now they've come in
[38:47.680 --> 38:51.240]  to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and they're openly announcing that in the next two
[38:51.240 --> 38:54.880]  years they're going to go ahead and scrap the dollar and when we lose the
[38:54.880 --> 38:58.360]  dollars the World Reserve currency that's all we've got left that's our
[38:58.360 --> 39:01.840]  export is dollars that we don't really make anything we don't really do
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.680]  anything except military and propaganda and now we're going to lose the dollar
[39:05.680 --> 39:09.600]  and on it they're going to have a new global system that regulates all the
[39:09.600 --> 39:13.560]  sub-currencies and sets the interest rates and the currency rates and they're
[39:13.560 --> 39:18.200]  openly announcing in the news in thousands of articles thousands of
[39:18.200 --> 39:26.360]  articles today not hundreds thousands today and thousands yesterday and
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.440]  thousands the day before and thousands of articles a day before that they say
[39:31.440 --> 39:37.560]  we're setting up a new order and what is that and they brag Obama says at the
[39:37.560 --> 39:41.960]  UN that a unipolar world is over but the American Empire is over that's right
[39:41.960 --> 39:46.080]  we have served our purpose to empower the world government Empire now we
[39:46.080 --> 39:50.320]  recede into history we are looted we become a third world police state that
[39:50.320 --> 39:56.160]  just supplies military hardware and troops and Europe and China become the
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.480]  center of the new world order along with Russia and the global taxation system
[40:00.480 --> 40:06.840]  with the carbon tax is now being erected and set up and they explain that
[40:06.840 --> 40:10.560]  that is what it means the group of 20 rich and developing countries is to take
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.480]  on a new role as caretaker of the global economy oh they'll be the caretaker the
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.320]  London telegraph says giving rising stars such as China and India more say
[40:19.320 --> 40:26.520]  in world affairs and Obama now chairs you see the 15 member rotating security
[40:26.520 --> 40:31.960]  council has always had the US ambassador to the UN sharing it when it falls to
[40:31.960 --> 40:37.240]  the United States every 15 months because article one section nine states
[40:37.240 --> 40:40.000]  the president can't serve a foreign government or corporation or swear and
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.920]  oath any other group or take a title of nobility can't take a job as the
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.960]  chairman of the East India Company can't take a job can't become knighted by the
[40:49.960 --> 40:53.600]  throne and all of its duties can't be part of another government can't be a
[40:53.600 --> 40:57.400]  minister in the Austrian or the Chinese government and you certainly can't be a
[40:57.400 --> 41:05.560]  minister in the G 20 you certainly that and again that's the governmental chairs
[41:05.560 --> 41:09.480]  of the banking system of the nation states and you certainly can't as a
[41:09.480 --> 41:15.800]  president be seated as the chairman of the UN Security Council and its 15
[41:15.800 --> 41:22.360]  members but president Obama did it and he's now being called the president of
[41:22.360 --> 41:32.080]  the world that's what they're doing and he's setting the precedent and that's
[41:32.080 --> 41:34.600]  why and later we're gonna play the video of this when we're live at
[41:34.600 --> 41:40.720]  prisonplanet.tv but play the audio for radio listeners that's why whenever
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.960]  Obama two days ago gabbled in the UN Security Council Henry Kissinger that
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.480]  was there and Obama thanked him with his mouth hanging open Susan Rice US
[41:52.480 --> 41:57.600]  ambassador the UN was in ecstasy behind him Rahm Emanuel was in ecstasy some of
[41:57.600 --> 42:01.720]  them general James L. Jones the head of the National Security Council the
[42:01.720 --> 42:09.840]  Northcom dictatorship Rice was shaking Rice was in ecstasy they in fact they
[42:09.840 --> 42:13.640]  admitted on CNN and Fox that everyone was twittering in the chamber and
[42:13.640 --> 42:19.120]  freaking out over him quote becoming president of the world and then a new
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.120]  world order had been born and Obama didn't look too excited when he was
[42:23.120 --> 42:29.920]  sworn in or gave a speech to be US president January 21st of 2009 but when
[42:29.920 --> 42:37.520]  Obama gaveled his voice was shaking he radiated a hitlerian type energy that
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.600]  dictator energy I've seen out of Mao Stalin and Hitler and he truly blazed
[42:42.600 --> 42:48.240]  with the demoniac glow go watch it for yourself I mean this was at every
[42:48.240 --> 42:51.360]  instinctive and political and intellectual level in my soul and heart
[42:51.360 --> 42:57.440]  and mind and intellect this really shook me in the last two days to watch this he
[42:57.440 --> 43:02.080]  is the prototype of things to come but they're openly announcing world taxes
[43:02.080 --> 43:05.400]  world regulation shutting down our economy kids
[43:05.400 --> 43:09.120]  tattling on their parents' climate cops writing their parents tickets from the
[43:09.120 --> 43:12.920]  public school the public schools becoming the spy bases to take over the
[43:12.920 --> 43:20.920]  communities it is all happening what you're seeing is the complete destruction
[43:20.920 --> 43:24.840]  and fall the republic now we can use this against them though like judo
[43:24.840 --> 43:28.120]  they're openly announcing world government openly announcing world
[43:28.120 --> 43:32.720]  taxation openly announcing no free speech in major u.s. cities when any big
[43:32.720 --> 43:37.680]  event happens sound canning nine-year-old children in their front yards and
[43:37.680 --> 43:40.960]  neighborhoods driving down empty streets announcing no one's allowed to be on
[43:40.960 --> 43:45.840]  the streets that is classical martial law invoking the patriot act of
[43:45.840 --> 43:48.840]  pennsylvania that's the code they're invoking pennsylvania was chosen for
[43:48.840 --> 43:53.360]  this meeting because it has the most draconian state laws remember back in
[43:53.360 --> 43:57.040]  2003 they passed the pennsylvania patriot act that has the sneak and peeks the
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.920]  secret arrest the snatch and grabs and the military is now snatching and
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.520]  grabbing just pulling up and randomly it appears grabbing peaceful protesters
[44:05.520 --> 44:10.320]  off the streets but the police and the military are laughing and it looks
[44:10.320 --> 44:14.880]  completely staged but just setting that precedent of snatching grabs they pull
[44:14.880 --> 44:19.120]  up in a van or a car grab you by your shoulders and drag you screaming into
[44:19.120 --> 44:25.800]  the vehicle it is unspeakably evil and they're setting these beta test
[44:25.800 --> 44:29.840]  precedent just like they did in 99 with seattle saying no free speech allowed in
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.560]  the city after they had 50 hired anarchist stage attacks on police and
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.400]  that was all declassified run by the delta force the FBI the secret service
[44:37.400 --> 44:41.800]  the g-20 admits and Pittsburgh admits that the secret service and army are
[44:41.800 --> 44:46.080]  running this operation look at my reporters defense link puts out a
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.200]  press release says that media can come talk to them where they're massing at
[44:50.200 --> 44:53.480]  the National Guard Armory they pull up the front gate say hi we're from info

[44:56.720 --> 45:02.320]  10 in Austin and the radio and they told him that they laughed at him came
[45:02.320 --> 45:05.160]  back said we want to talk to your boss then they got me on the phone then they
[45:05.160 --> 45:09.120]  laughed at us and get out of here maybe come back tomorrow then they call the
[45:09.120 --> 45:12.160]  police and say people are at our perimeter sneaking around they ran from
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.240]  us we got their plate number the police call us up on the cell phone they got
[45:16.240 --> 45:21.480]  from the rent car company posing as an animal rental car person and say we
[45:21.480 --> 45:24.280]  know you're terrorist you're never gonna get off the terrorist watch list in
[45:24.280 --> 45:29.960]  your life laughing about it this is the new secret police America nine-year-olds
[45:29.960 --> 45:35.440]  being hit with sound cannons by police and black uniforms in the army here
[45:35.440 --> 45:40.920]  seeing in crowing and but at the same time whitewashing like oh for a day no
[45:40.920 --> 45:45.240]  he's not head of the United Nations for a day and if you study the U.N. power
[45:45.240 --> 45:49.840]  structure the secretary general is the head of the general assembly but the
[45:49.840 --> 45:56.720]  180 plus nations in it only 15 have voting power the real government it's
[45:56.720 --> 45:59.800]  not the shadow government because but it is you don't really hear about it in the
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.960]  media much but you notice one veto of one security council member can override
[46:04.960 --> 46:10.760]  the entire general assembly it's the real power and Barack Obama is now the
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.400]  president of the U.N. he's now the chairman of the U.N. Security Council
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.960]  here is singing in celebrating Barack Obama calls some usually dull
[46:19.960 --> 46:24.160]  diplomats to come to life in the historic United Nations Security Council
[46:24.160 --> 46:29.560]  Obama's U.N. debut created a stir even in a room packed with heads of state and
[46:29.560 --> 46:36.680]  government and for a couple of hours you could say Mr. Obama was president of
[46:36.680 --> 46:40.760]  the world flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.N. Ambassador
[46:40.760 --> 46:45.960]  Susan Rice Mr. Obama used the United States one month council presidency to
[46:45.960 --> 46:49.960]  drive approval of a resolution aimed at putting more teeth into curbing the
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.600]  spread of nuclear weapons prior to now there have been only four such security
[46:54.600 --> 46:58.440]  council summits I called for this one so that we may address at the highest
[46:58.440 --> 47:02.160]  level a fundamental threat to the security of all peoples and all nations
[47:02.160 --> 47:07.560]  the spread and use of nuclear weapons the resolution calls for tighter
[47:07.560 --> 47:12.360]  controls on nuclear materials to prevent military usage or theft the U.S.
[47:12.360 --> 47:16.880]  wants the resolution to provide momentum for action on nukes oh yeah let's stop
[47:16.880 --> 47:20.680]  right there is diplomat how did they sell the League of Nations after the
[47:20.680 --> 47:24.720]  Rothschilds and Rockefellers and others British intelligence on record stage
[47:24.720 --> 47:31.760]  the assassination of the Archduke start world war one they said we have to have
[47:31.760 --> 47:34.200]  this to end war then they got their League of Nations and they staged
[47:34.200 --> 47:37.480]  world war two telling Hitler to go ahead and invade that's now been
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.600]  declassified then setting him up I'm saying he's good it's just the fact they
[47:41.600 --> 47:45.760]  set him up that's why the deputy furor Rudolph has flew into England with the
[47:45.760 --> 47:49.440]  treaty saying look we signed a secret treaty the king of England had to
[47:49.440 --> 47:54.960]  advocate he'd been a Nazi but now they've always pushed the UN oh we got to
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.120]  have a world government global governance to stop a nuclear war all the
[47:58.120 --> 48:02.120]  globalists give nukes out to everybody they gave it to Russia they gave it to
[48:02.120 --> 48:05.520]  China on record they gave it to Pakistan they gave it to South Africa they gave
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.440]  it to Israel and now we got to have a world government to stop nukes
[48:10.440 --> 48:14.320]  spreading so that's just the front but the real power they want is financial
[48:14.320 --> 48:20.920]  now here he is Obama this is directly from the UN gabbling in the Security
[48:20.920 --> 48:29.960]  Council as the president of the world here it is that's the UN intro
[48:29.960 --> 48:47.840]  the 6191st meeting of the Security Council is called to order the
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.800]  provisional agenda for this meeting is before the council in document s slash
[48:52.800 --> 49:02.960]  agenda slash 6191 which reads quote maintenance of international peace and
[49:02.960 --> 49:10.560]  security nuclear proliferation and nuclear disarmament unless I hear any
[49:10.560 --> 49:19.520]  objection I shall consider the agenda adopted agenda is adopted I wish to
[49:19.520 --> 49:27.520]  warmly welcome the distinguished heads of state and government the general the
[49:27.520 --> 49:33.120]  secretary general the director general of the IAEA ministers and other
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.440]  distinguished representatives present in the Security Council chamber your
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.640]  presence is an affirmation of the importance of the subject matter to be
[49:41.640 --> 49:47.480]  discussed the Security Council summit will now begin its consideration of item
[49:47.480 --> 49:54.360]  two of the agenda all right you can go watch hours of it online at the UN if
[49:54.360 --> 50:00.280]  you want that's directly from the United Nations what we just played now he is
[50:00.280 --> 50:04.800]  the president of the world and that's how this six system works with the 15
[50:04.800 --> 50:07.480]  members they each get to be president of the world and that's how they consider
[50:07.480 --> 50:13.200]  themselves that's what they are openly announced as and coming up in 15 months
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.800]  again he will be the president of the world one more time and in all the
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.040]  financial times of London headlines and a whole bunch of others they say this is
[50:21.040 --> 50:24.680]  cementing world government that Obama is bringing the US into world government
[50:24.680 --> 50:28.840]  that he is relinquishing US control over the world government it's well known the
[50:28.840 --> 50:34.720]  US runs the world government right now and it was the Pentagon in 1946 that
[50:34.720 --> 50:38.680]  created the United Nations at the Presidio Naval Base in San Francisco the
[50:38.680 --> 50:43.120]  Rockefellers put the money up for it there to lease the base and in New
[50:43.120 --> 50:52.880]  York and so this is a horrible day for our nation our military our government
[50:52.880 --> 50:56.160]  our traders they've totally sold us out and they're gonna steal everything
[50:56.160 --> 51:02.040]  that's even nailed down you got that when you hear the words water
[51:02.040 --> 51:06.480]  purification what comes to mind if it's Berkey water purification systems this
[51:06.480 --> 51:10.880]  message is for you did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains

[55:13.400 --> 55:17.480]  nightmare Stalin was a nightmare Mao was a nightmare they were all funded by
[55:17.480 --> 55:22.240]  these people Pol Pot all of them we have the government documents we have the
[55:22.240 --> 55:25.480]  proof it isn't just a world government that's gonna tax you and run your life
[55:25.480 --> 55:31.440]  with Tobin taxes and money transfer taxes and carbon taxes world government
[55:31.440 --> 55:35.040]  is only the tool as John P. Holder and White House science are says the
[55:35.040 --> 55:44.080]  planetary regime is the tool to kill you and the reason they may succeed is
[55:44.080 --> 55:51.480]  because it's so bold it's so off the charts it's so outrageous it's so criminal
[55:51.480 --> 55:56.800]  it's so corrupt that they would openly in the last year still over 50 trillion
[55:56.800 --> 56:01.760]  worldwide 23.7 trillion and again that's a two month old number it'll be 28
[56:01.760 --> 56:08.160]  trill following the trend next 28 trill plus I was underestimate what it's gonna
[56:08.160 --> 56:12.560]  be next time they announce it every two months we're due to hear 23.7 trillion
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.240]  almost two months ago we're due to hear the new number and I cringe and they
[56:17.240 --> 56:21.200]  just are openly stealing every treasury blind openly deploying police and
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.120]  military on the streets everywhere openly coming in with tyranny now if we
[56:26.120 --> 56:30.800]  speak out and point out that it's just a group of private bankers doing this we
[56:30.800 --> 56:34.160]  can start reversing it that's why one of our biggest hopes is Ron Paul's
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.320]  resolution to audit these people because we're starting the process and
[56:37.320 --> 56:41.480]  beginning to really draw blood in the fight really beginning to land some
[56:41.480 --> 56:45.240]  strong punches on the enemy that people are now going wait banks run the
[56:45.240 --> 56:48.760]  country private banks control the government all over the world people
[56:48.760 --> 56:52.840]  are finding out as the in the fed movement goes global and they're
[56:52.840 --> 56:55.440]  starting to get scared that's why they're accelerating their program right
[56:55.440 --> 56:59.680]  now they were trying incremental but they were starting to fail they realized
[56:59.680 --> 57:04.600]  they're now behind the eight ball this is red level emergency this is real
[57:04.600 --> 57:11.240]  got up and get educated about this stuff I know that you want to rationalize and
[57:11.240 --> 57:15.360]  tell yourself this isn't true because it's scary but listen it is real we've
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.800]  proven it's real in in-game and terror storm and the Obama deception and all
[57:19.800 --> 57:23.280]  the mainstream news is now confirming everything we told you but they put their
[57:23.280 --> 57:32.240]  own sick spin on it and support us that's why the establishment with the
[57:32.240 --> 57:35.920]  mainstream media and alternative media attacks Ron Paul attacks me attacks
[57:35.920 --> 57:40.960]  anybody that they know is effectively countering them to try to get everybody
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.000]  fighting with each other with divide and conquer instead of identifying the new
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.200]  world order Ron Paul isn't the one raising your taxes Ron Paul isn't the one
[57:48.200 --> 57:52.280]  bringing in a world carbon tax Ron Paul isn't the one taking over our economy
[57:52.280 --> 57:58.960]  Alex Jones now that's me I'm not the one that runs your life I'm not the one
[57:58.960 --> 58:01.480]  that's putting cancer viruses in the vaccine to try to make you take them
[58:01.480 --> 58:05.520]  and so when the feds try to get us all in fighting realize that that's their
[58:05.520 --> 58:09.640]  attempt with Co and tell pro and they also use just the general public's
[58:09.640 --> 58:14.120]  jealousy of anybody successful to play us off against each other you ever seen
[58:14.120 --> 58:17.240]  crabs in a bucket if you're crab fishing at the beach put three or four in the
[58:17.240 --> 58:20.040]  bucket they could climb out if they worked with each other but any crab that
[58:20.040 --> 58:24.280]  tries to climb out they all run over and pinch him and dragging down if we
[58:24.280 --> 58:28.040]  don't get over the crab in the bucket syndrome
[58:29.600 --> 58:33.640]  well you're gonna see what's gonna happen but we are mounting a successful
[58:33.640 --> 58:37.880]  offensive against the enemy we'll be right back with reports from the G20 from

[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:49.160]  president Obama has been announced as president of the world at the UN and
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:54.160]  illegally taken the chairmanship of the UN Security Council the only true
[1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:57.760]  governing body in the UN that has power the general assembly is a puppet
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:02.720]  powerless assembly and the assembly admits that he's now more powerful in
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:06.840]  the UN secretary general he is now more powerful in the US president he holds
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:14.120]  the dual post Jason Douglas is with us live from protest in day two of the
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:19.440]  opening announcement for world government and the end of the dollar Jason
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:24.120]  Burmese is at another location we'll go to both of them after the break when we
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:29.120]  go live at prisonplanet.tv with a complete report Jason Douglas what are
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:33.320]  you witnessing right now right now I'm in the middle of the United Field
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:40.360]  Workers Union and there are so many groups here all very distrustful that
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:44.120]  what's happening with the current state of the world we are just marching off
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:50.360]  the UPenn campus I would estimate there's about 10,000 plus people here
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:55.800]  it's still very peaceful you know people just speaking their minds and marching
[1:01:55.800 --> 1:02:00.200]  forward can you use the sound cannons on us again
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:05.200]  well just to be clear how this works the city has said no protest allowed no
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:09.840]  permits being issued no First Amendment and so right at the time the police are
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:15.400]  about to engage the peaceful people 10 to 15 hired federal agents dressed as
[1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:20.760]  anarchists will tump over a few trash cans for a stage CNN Fox News photo op
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:25.160]  they will then attack the peaceful crowd the police will with beanbags rubber
[1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:33.240]  bullets pepper spray CS and and the sound weapons this is the MO it's key
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:38.560]  Jason that you show people on video how right when the police arrive and try to
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:43.600]  block you and announce that it's an awful assembly the public would see that
[1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:48.560]  on the news is abusive unless the staged anarchists give them the pretext to
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:55.240]  attack that will happen exactly they are definitely looking for any sort of
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:03:00.880]  excuse I mean they're all bad already and you know most of every people are
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:04.440]  just walking walking around speaking their mind you do have these small
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:09.760]  inflates of people that are you know they're pretending that they're really
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:14.920]  dissatisfied but it's just obvious that they're hired where is everybody
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:19.560]  marching to we're trying to make it to the convention center they wouldn't
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:24.920]  even let the permitted protest go that direction you know they're just
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:28.200]  ostriches with their head what I saw on the news is they're not allowing any
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:32.760]  protesters saying there is a permitted March there was one on the 20th and they
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:35.400]  wouldn't even let that one go there wasn't even any one down at the
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:39.800]  convention center but they still didn't let it go down there we've seen photos
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:43.840]  and videos of the sound weapon trucks armored vehicles even in
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:47.360]  neighborhoods Jason where there's literally one or two people on the
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:51.320]  street like a nine-year-old kid with a ball in his front yard and they still
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:57.120]  drive by and blast them yeah right by people's homes I was standing by one
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:00.640]  home it had you know several family members out on the scoop with their
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:04.960]  baby and they blast the sound cannon and it just feels like your ear drums are
[1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:08.880]  gonna blow out of your skull so that is confirmed yesterday or today you saw
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:13.240]  them blast a family with a baby on their front porch it's confirmed I saw them
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:18.680]  you know they were blasting all of us this is unbelievable I remember in
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:24.320]  Portland five years ago an anti-war march they came and blocked it in and
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:27.800]  came up and sprayed babies and baby carriages and the mother said why are
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:31.920]  you spraying my baby and the policemen said listening you you f-ing bleeper
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:35.160]  you shouldn't bring a kid to a protest so they love targeting children

[1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:14.720]  solutions from science in Thompson Illinois these emergency backup systems
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:18.920]  provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators
[1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:23.720]  a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:27.720]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:32.040]  some pumps short wave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling

[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:10.840]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN
[1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.720]  radio network
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:23.400]  that is the sounds of the march we estimate to be more than 2,000 people in Pittsburgh
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:27.440]  marching from the University to the convention center where the G20 is
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:32.520]  meeting Jason Burmes is there at the head of the March at the end of the
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:37.600]  March is Rob do and Jason Douglas will be going to all of them I'll be
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:42.560]  recapping all the big developments that have happened they are using sound
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:45.760]  cannons even in neighborhoods on children and people on their front
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:49.960]  porches they go into even small side streets and announce no one allowed on
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:54.360]  the streets basically a Pittsburgh they invoke the state's Patriot Act that they
[1:08:54.360 --> 1:08:59.280]  have it's very draconian it has been confirmed they're using sound cannons
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:04.800]  even CNN admits that but neocon sites are denying it exist because they're
[1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:08.280]  basically Pentagon run that's a military tactic they're still saying there's no
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:11.200]  new world order they're still saying there's no bank of the world they're
[1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:15.120]  still saying there's no global carbon tax in the media as they simultaneously
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.440]  announce it that's a psychological warfare tactic to say we're not
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:23.560]  assaulting you while they're assaulting mindless neocons claim G20 abduction
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.920]  video is fake it is clearly not fake these are real military officers and a
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:32.480]  real police crown Vic jumping out and grabbing a protester and dragging him
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:38.320]  away I'm saying that it could be staged in that it's real military we know that
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.480]  but that they could be staging snatch and grabs as we know they did in Ottawa
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:48.440]  the Royal Mounted Police have admitted last year that they staged a attack on
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:53.680]  their own police then had to fake arrest the anarchist put them into police
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:10:01.000]  cars that's admitted Toronto son but of course the neocon websites are not
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.960]  going to admit that they're just gonna keep saying nothing's happening there's
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:08.640]  no sound cannons none of this is going on stand down this is not an assault
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:14.240]  classic Pentagon operation they're also of course saying that the video of sound
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:18.840]  cannons and police in black uniforms in the army sound canning people including
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:22.800]  children is fake it's all admitted but they're gonna make it about a debate of
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:26.960]  whether it's real or not so we never psychologically have a debate on whether
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:30.920]  it's good to have the military sound cannoning children and saying no protest
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:34.680]  allowed they may even say Pittsburgh doesn't exist they may even say
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:38.880]  Pennsylvania doesn't exist so you will then debate with them that Pennsylvania
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:45.040]  exist there over 8,000 news articles today on Google News if you put the term
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:49.280]  New World Order in over 8,000 openly announcing it's a global government
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:53.400]  global tax that the US is going down that Obama is great for being the new
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:57.880]  president of the world chairing the UN Security Council the UN Security
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:03.200]  Council exist Obama exist all of this exist and but if they can just keep
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:07.520]  saying it doesn't exist while they say it exists and it's good then when you say
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:11.520]  I don't like it they then say it doesn't exist Burma's that is classical
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:15.280]  psychological warfare Jason Burma's reporting from the head of the March and
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:22.200]  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania right now it looks like a little over 2,000 people
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:27.400]  they are condensed into one street there seems to be much less of a police
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:31.720]  presence at this March at least at the moment we're not really anywhere near
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:36.480]  downtown Pittsburgh yet so we'll see what happens as we approach it if they
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:41.800]  let us go over into the downtown area I highly doubt it the downtown area is
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:47.080]  where you see the heaviest concentration of military but right now I'm taping and
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:50.200]  this is more of an eclectic group yesterday I didn't see any of the
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:55.720]  Iraqi war veterans against the war here I'm seeing dozens if not hundreds I'm
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:00.240]  seeing around a hundred hundred and fifty pre-depress protested it seems like
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:03.760]  you know although there is an anarchist element here there's somewhere towards
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:06.840]  the middle of the crowd and we can only hope that they won't be able to
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.840]  provide for the event today as they did yesterday well what they're gonna do is
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:14.520]  they're gonna wait till you get to the place where the police are masked in
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:22.000]  front and to the sides then once you get into the trap police will come from
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.600]  behind then the anarchist for the news media will then come out of the middle
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:31.800]  go to the front they'll probably stage it with the police on a hill so they can
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:35.520]  roll a garbage dumpster at them for dramatic effect like I did yesterday
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:38.960]  they'll then open fire with rubber bullets pepper spray and sound cannons
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:43.600]  on the 2000 so the media can replay yesterday and every other big event
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:48.480]  we've seen here's the key Burmese Jason Burmese reporting from Pittsburgh
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:52.800]  we're gonna play this video which the neocons are saying is fake they're
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:56.440]  saying it's not real military it's clearly real military they're clearly
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:01.720]  wearing the real badge it's a plastic clear badge with a white badge for the
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:06.920]  police to recognize in the arm it's clearly an unmarked crown Vic you can
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:10.520]  look it's military they're well conditioned they're in good shape
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:15.760]  they're big military police cops you see the classic hired informant types
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:20.880]  giving hand signals when you watch the video they're giving hand signals to the
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:26.640]  police and and they the guy is smiling and laughing and the cops are just like
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:30.000]  the urban warfare drills they do they then do the drills live-action but
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.720]  don't tell people their drills I'm almost sure watching this video as they
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:38.160]  throw him in he's laughing and the guy with them gives a hand signal to police
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:43.920]  they drive off into tear gas this is a psy op to sell people on the idea that
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:48.240]  the military pulls up and grabs you into a car and that's how they protect their
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:52.360]  people that have just engaged in some type of violence we didn't see that on
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:56.400]  the video but the video is very short that may have happened earlier for the
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:12.240]  police to have a pretext to crack down on people jason bermas you know it's over
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:18.240]  12 27 trillion at this point this is a great turnout Alex I would really hate
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:22.480]  to see this be ruined of course we saw the chaos yesterday and you know I'm
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:27.040]  prepared for anything hopefully I'm gonna get to be able to talk to some of these
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:30.280]  protesters when we get down to the downtown area but I am seeing a lot of
[1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:34.840]  signs that are really busting through the left-right paradigm a few people
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:40.440]  have a amalgamation of both Barack Obama and George Bush as one being they
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:45.200]  get it they understand this war is not over this war is not ending the economy
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:49.160]  is only getting worse we are moving towards global governance of course you
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:56.200]  know we can only hope to reach them Alex well I'm we're playing video right
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:02.040]  now of last night at the university with police and military and military and
[1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:07.080]  riot gear with shotguns we rubber bullets that will kill you if they shoot you
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:10.240]  from five ten feet away in many cases there's been a lot of that and they
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:13.920]  come up with a billy club and attack an innocent woman and tackle her for
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:19.920]  absolutely no reason
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:47.760]  I'm all about protesting but when you get dressed up in black and you put a
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:51.240]  black mask on and you're here to destroy property what is that going to
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:54.960]  accomplish and I was like right on you know you're you're dead right you know
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:58.280]  we have our freedom of speech but those people aren't helping and that's the
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:02.400]  girl they are at this girl with a sign who is out there on trying to exercise
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:06.840]  a free speech and enlighten people to the fact that listen you don't need to
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:10.720]  you know dress in all black and think you're a tough guy and follow along with
[1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:14.920]  the people of the tours for instance Wendy Sheehan actually went to the
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:19.120]  anarchist meeting the night before last before yesterday's protest and was
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:23.200]  kicked out they didn't water there they don't want legitimate voices amongst
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:28.920]  them because they know that he control the idiot masses well I'm watching the
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:33.440]  video of the guy that was arrested by the police after the military grabbed the
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:40.640]  one guy and this looks fake to me clearly the other guy it is fake
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:45.640]  but but if this person isn't an operative he needs to later contact us and
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:51.680]  explain to us what happened but talking to Douglas talking to you Bermas do
[1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:56.480]  Douglas has said it clearly looks staged with what he's seen what do you
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:00.680]  think of these anarchists well you know I think a lot of them are just well
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:04.400]  meaning idiots however the people in charge the people that are directing
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:09.960]  them obviously have an agenda you know I got an interview with about 20 of the
[1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:14.280]  anarchist yesterday prior to the March and I mean they were just it was
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:18.320]  idiocy I'm like well what your group is called what and they were like team
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:23.440]  space back and I'm like what is team space back even mean and no one could
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:27.880]  tell me they all just gave me a dumb looker just like yeah okay and I'll
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:32.840]  and they said some other bolder things but not the issues will be discussed they
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:36.920]  had no other objective other than to be there and try to rebel against something
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:42.600]  they know nothing about well that's how it works is it is that we've been at in
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:46.240]  the Fed protests and other places and these anarchists will come in who are
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:50.040]  well-spoken in good shape and they'll say come on let's cause trouble let's do
[1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:53.520]  something bad and then in the Fed protesters have caught them later going
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:57.640]  yeah we can't get these people to do even J walk what are we gonna do and over
[1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:00.600]  and over again the feds have been caught provocaturing state police have been
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:04.080]  caught going into meetings and getting maybe one out of a thousand people in a
[1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:07.720]  warehouse to say they'll do something violent and then they raid the whole
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:09.560]  facility
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:14.240]  absolutely and again we hope that doesn't happen again I am seeing about a
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:19.160]  presence of about a hundred or so anarchists in the middle of the March in a
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:25.000]  concentrated area you know again Alex we'll see when we get down there right
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.760]  now the police presence is very very slim the guards are not arched the teeth
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:34.440]  as they were yesterday I have yet to see any military really the biggest
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:39.640]  concentration of our riot police was at the University on the way in with this
[1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:43.720]  protest took place that started right around the corner but barman's this is
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:47.560]  how it always works they want the March concentrated because it's easier to block
[1:18:47.560 --> 1:18:52.840]  in once you near your destination that's when watch they're gonna come out and
[1:18:52.840 --> 1:18:58.200]  block the street then come in on the sides let you fill up the the pincer
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:02.720]  movement and then they're gonna close the gate on the back of you well let's
[1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:06.040]  just pray and hope that they don't start shooting tear gas like yesterday because
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:10.400]  I've got two two-year-olds passing me with their father right now and I would
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:14.520]  hate to see these toddlers get into any kind of situation where they would be
[1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:20.480]  subject to a fuse from riot police and there's been a lot of tear gasing going
[1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:24.960]  on a lot of microwave gunning going on I mean a lot of sound cannoning going on
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:29.880]  and meanwhile the neocons are denying on their websites that any of this is
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:34.200]  even happening well it's just incredible Alex I mean I don't know how the
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:38.440]  mainstream media is going to cover this but this is at least 2,000 people this
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:43.040]  may be on the brink of 3,000 you know just moving my way to the front of the
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:48.200]  line could be about 15 20 minutes Burmese do we know why they attacked I'm
[1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:50.520]  gonna ask this when we come back I'm gonna ask Douglas as well stay there
[1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:54.000]  Jason Douglas also in another area of the March why did they attack the
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.600]  university last night I mean I've got video of them tacking frat kids

[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:13.520]  believed that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop

[1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:17.720]  Pennsylvania and another area of the 2000 plus people that we estimate are
[1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:23.000]  marching right now from Pitt they're in Pittsburgh into another area of the city
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:28.120]  where again are you guys marching Jason Douglas
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:32.880]  right now we are at Seneca Street and Fifth Avenue we're in between the
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:37.840]  Convention Center and UPenn and we're still formed in one group they haven't
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:42.440]  splintered us off yet and there's really been minimal police in comparison to
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:47.920]  yesterday yeah well they I mean usually they attack on the first official day
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:51.280]  because they want to set the precedent that protesting is bad and you're
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.440]  violent and bad but I think you're going to see even more tonight coming up
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:01.640]  continue basically I have a feeling that they're funneling us into someplace
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:04.960]  so then they'll start to splinter us off and then they'll close the gate just like
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:08.680]  they did yesterday yeah that's the standard operating procedure they may do
[1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:13.040]  something else you you set on air but can you elaborate that these people these
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:19.280]  anarchist act and behave like feds the few engaged in violence right well
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:22.400]  basically you have a large group of people dressed in black with black
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:27.240]  masks and you know all thing anarchist stuff you can tell that the larger group
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:31.160]  you know it's people that just want something else besides what we have
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:36.920]  right now and are looking to anything but then you have these copos that are
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:41.920]  basically in control of the larger group and they're doing paramilitary stuff
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:48.040]  where you know they're basically funneling people and obviously working in
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:53.720]  coordination and then then they do these spurts of violence it's just
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:59.080]  provocation I'm watching video from pit last night with the sound cannons
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:05.280]  hitting people it's just unbelievably hardcore for the radio listeners you can
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:09.600]  go to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and watch all these scores of videos we
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:12.360]  have posted to give you different snapshots of what happened but we're
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:17.520]  also streaming this live at prisonplanet.tv right now the video but it
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:23.240]  just Jason I want these nighttime shots the Darth Vader element of it is
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:27.360]  incredibly cinematic to get the point across in the next film the Darth Vader
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:37.200]  thing we were actually out last night we drove right by the area that they said all the violence took place and we were thinking we
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:42.880]  were just there so if an event happened it was a coordinated event with the
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:47.440]  police and with the military because it happened in 15 minutes here they are
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:52.920]  attacking some girl that's got away 95 pounds she seems disoriented the sound
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:56.640]  cannons are going off she's asking please don't hurt me and then they just
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:01.000]  absolutely attack her boom Billy club to the head boom they pull her to the
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:06.320]  ground giant 250-pound man piles on top of her the Darth Vader's continues
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:11.240]  stomping past unbelievable
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:18.280]  and the cops and then the cops love bugging their eyes out at everybody
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:21.480]  with pure hatred I mean they've really been trained to hate the citizenry of
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:25.160]  this nation and he said you better get that camera out of my face different
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:28.440]  people it's like they're two different people when they're in the line they
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:34.040]  have a completely big there you know you can tell their combat hard but I've
[1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:38.440]  actually caught behind the line but just the guys once they become guys and they
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:42.160]  just start talking to each other they're questioning their order they're
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:45.880]  actually I heard some people saying something like you know these people are
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:51.760]  just you know want to be hurt why can't why can't they just let them speak so
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:28:00.840]  there is dissension in the rate we are having an effect out here well the
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:04.320]  cops usually figure out later that there were provocateurs hired by the feds
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:08.000]  in there yet it's happened all over the nation people that don't aren't aware of
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:13.240]  that latest incident was Denver Post reported on what happened last year at
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.720]  the DNC in Denver the police were posing as anarchists attacking other
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:23.200]  police they also hire informants federal informants state informants we've got

[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:46.440]  neighborhoods and you said you saw this yesterday Jason Douglas confirmed we
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:49.320]  need to get a headline up that he saw them rolling through neighborhoods
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:54.160]  hitting people on their front porches announcing no one's even allowed outside
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.360]  their homes not they don't care what your business is not even one person now
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:03.080]  can walk clearly they're hurting you they're gonna block off the streets soon
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:07.840]  and block you in front then the sides then in back and then attack you get
[1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:12.080]  out as soon as you see them starting to close the net get out so you can shoot
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:20.520]  video from the outside Jason Bermas great job we salute your courage absolutely
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:24.000]  yeah you know I've been to more than 20 of these events over the years and film
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:27.840]  similar things happening but never seen them use the sound cannons I saw them
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:31.760]  having them in New York and other places and running mopeds and horses into
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:34.800]  people and tear-gassing and rubber-bulleting and arresting innocent
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:40.000]  people and provocateurs and I've had the military pull guns on us once in
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:48.360]  San Antonio but I have I have never seen something of this magnitude going on
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:54.600]  let's go to Bob Chapman former stockbroker former gold broker at one
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:57.560]  time ran the biggest private newsletter out there came back out of retirement
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:01.440]  with the international forecaster also worked in military intelligence always
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:06.040]  great to have him on with us we were off last Friday so we skipped our meeting
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:09.840]  with him but it's good to have him here Bob quite a momentous occasion they're
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:14.440]  openly announcing Obama as president of the world openly announcing he's the
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:17.600]  head of the UN Security Council the real power position in the UN the
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:22.040]  chairmanship openly announcing world government and into the dollar this is
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:28.760]  amazing well it was expected we didn't know when but it was expected and it's
[1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:33.560]  happening it's still going to take them a long time to try to implement this
[1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:38.240]  they're going to get all kinds of heat from the American public and the public
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:46.960]  of other countries as well and I think their pronunciation pronouncements
[1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:54.320]  regarding cutting back on the amount of money and credit and the amount of money
[1:38:54.320 --> 1:39:00.400]  being issued by central banks to keep banks within their systems functioning
[1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:06.120]  all of that is a smoke screen they cannot cut back if they cut back the whole
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:11.200]  system collapses now it all depends on what I want to collapse the system too
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:16.600]  but I figure they'll try to keep it going for about a year and a half to two
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:19.960]  more years and then I think they're going to pull the plug and that what I
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:27.280]  mean by that is they'll stop inundating the world economy with money and credit
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:33.040]  and shut it down and we'll go into a deflationary depression they'll probably
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:39.000]  accompany it by biological warfare against everybody in the world and then
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:43.440]  I think they'll make their move for world government
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:54.440]  continue Bob I think that this meeting is really a facade for something more
[1:39:54.440 --> 1:39:59.520]  important that they've got planned down the road they really didn't go deeply
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:09.880]  into anything except each country auditing one another to make sure that
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:14.920]  they weren't getting themselves into any further financial trouble and that would
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:25.800]  be overlooked by the IMF and that's a new development they also want world
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:31.720]  regulation of all securities transactions they also want to tax it as well
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:36.840]  incidentally to and they're openly announcing in times of London BBC AP
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:40.120]  Reuters everything we broken down they would do because we're reading their
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:43.680]  own documents for decades it's no surprise but for the public it is who
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:49.560]  was denying what we were saying but the very same private banks that created the
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:53.000]  derivatives bubble are now going to be the world regulators and it's going to
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:58.600]  be a private bank of the world that we pay our taxes to and then the UN just
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.720]  serves as their military enforcer along with NATO in the United States and
[1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:08.000]  Obama said in speeches America must serve the New World Order and the media is
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:13.160]  praising him saying oh he admits America isn't powerful anymore I mean this is
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:19.440]  unbelievable treason Bob and to see him chair the UN Security Council something
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:23.000]  no president would do before on the rotating council because it was it's
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:29.160]  unconstitutional article one section 9 speak to that well you're absolutely
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:34.160]  right but to these people the Constitution doesn't mean anything they
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:39.240]  are the ultimate law they are you know they do what they want to do and they're
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:43.360]  going to continue to do that as long as we let them and that's why your your
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:48.360]  your program and programs like it and the publication such as a forecaster is so
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:53.120]  important and believe me we discussed this before we are reaching the public
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:59.520]  they are waking up and the military knows exactly what's going on at all of the
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:03.880]  medium to lower levels they know what the government's pulling what they're
[1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:10.400]  doing you know I have them on every week on one of the programs and the
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:18.200]  information that comes in is incredible in fact we just got a heads up on and I
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:22.800]  don't know if you've heard about this but there were three ships which we're
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:26.440]  out of San Diego and one of them I guess off the coast of Spain that's in the
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:34.640]  it's in the associate press right but I I've got the information from some of
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:41.880]  the lives of these people and so it'll it'll be a tomorrow's issue as to the
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:47.760]  fact that two of the senior offices and one of the ships died with this
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:53.240]  experiment that they pulled using American military people as guinea pigs
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:58.320]  wait are you saying project shad or something similar has been reignited
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:07.640]  yes and I will send you a copy of what I'm putting out as soon as we get off the
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:13.960]  program I just sent a piece to Bill Deagle who would request it I sent it to
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:18.200]  him when I got the information and I'll give it to you so as I get off the year
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:22.840]  I can't do it at this very moment is it okay if we link to it at that point or
[1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:27.080]  you want us to wait till tomorrow now you do anything you want all right
[1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:31.240]  public information okay good we'll get it up now I just wanted to be sure Bob a
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:35.200]  separate issue then I'm gonna talk about the police state going on the G20 the
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:39.520]  suspension of the First Amendment publicly by the police literally hitting
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:46.040]  children with sound cannons on video in photos I wanted to bring this up to you
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:50.560]  classic MO like we've seen in all the other cases of where they provocateur
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:56.400]  some mentally ill person or it's an informant Patsy they set up they admit
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:01.120]  in Dallas and in Illinois they wanted to bomb a 60-story skyscraper in Dallas
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:06.000]  where I'm from the big pyramid building they wanted to bomb a federal building
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.880]  in Illinois and in each cases it says the feds made a bomb were the person's
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:16.160]  commander they thought they're al-qaeda commander gave it to them to go carry it
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:20.800]  out and these guys are both out of prisons which is where they always recruit
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.520]  them out of and it's the same story every time where they go even see it and
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:29.760]  goes oh yeah the FBI went and found the guy letting gave him the truck bomb what
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:33.520]  he thought was a truck bomb gave him the other bomb totally staged at the same
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:38.800]  time now being blamed on Iran as they openly say Iran now has hidden nukes
[1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:43.000]  just like they said with Iraq the WMD's that didn't exist and that Israel may
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:50.360]  hit Iran can you speak to that well it's all a fallacy as we know and it's a
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:59.000]  setup and they may be looking to attack Iran finally and they're using the same
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.600]  script they're just changing the last letter from Iraq to Iran a queue to an
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:09.800]  end we've had a lot of experts and former CIA analyst on they're saying if
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:15.520]  Iran is hit any one of the three scenarios is gonna be devastating that's
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:20.000]  right because I'm sure that Russia and then China will get involved on the
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:27.080]  other side and it'll be a nuclear war for I there's no doubt in my mind and all
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:33.040]  I can say to you is listeners go and look at some of the pitches of Hiroshima
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:38.520]  and Nagasaki a few days after the bone was dropped you want to look at it it
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:41.920]  was nothing left standing virtually well I'll tell you why I believe it may have
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:49.000]  been green-lighted Benjamin Netanyahu says it is Medyev the puppet president
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.720]  of Russia saying oh we're gonna go ahead and put sanctions on Iran this came
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:58.840]  two weeks after Netanyahu Jerusalem Post reported false Moscow Times traveled
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:04.040]  to Moscow in a secret meeting to get the green light to hit them and then
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:08.720]  suddenly Obama announced they're not under the missile system now as a tent
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:14.800]  for tat it looks like Russia may have gotten on board possible but I was told
[1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:20.880]  by my informants that they are now able to accomplish the same thing via
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:29.120]  submarine as they could have with the missile emplacements in Poland and the
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:35.200]  radar in Czechoslovakia and I was told that Netanyahu was virtually thrown out
[1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:43.440]  of the office because he demanded that Russia stay out of it if if Israel went
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:51.880]  after Iran and and there was there was a big argument and that's you know I have
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:58.280]  to treat it as rumor and as much as you never know how good intelligence is I
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:05.680]  had that in the publication on Wednesday I believe but one of my people
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:12.000]  wrote in and I just actually published it the way it was but you know it's hard
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:16.400]  to say here what they're gonna do because there's so much it misinformation and
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:22.440]  there's so much information that we don't get this is a big thing I do know
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:27.600]  that they're planning on putting 500,000 troops and mercenaries in Afghanistan
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:34.000]  and they got about a hundred and sixty now and that's now been leaked from the
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:38.880]  Pentagon 500,000 trips boy what a piece Nick Obama is let me shift gears here
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:42.680]  Bob I want to get your take on this microwave guns we have video we've been
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:46.680]  playing it driving through neighborhoods just no one's even on the street people
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:50.560]  are video-tipping out their windows and there's photos we've got I was looking at
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:54.920]  last night Aaron still asleep as he was up till 5 a.m. I'm told I left it at 2
[1:47:54.920 --> 1:47:58.840]  after I was on coast to coast I emitted some work here I should have printed that
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:02.200]  off but it was photos and videos on his computer I can go check during a break
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:07.000]  and try to find it up like little kids just walking down the street or in their
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.440]  front yard no one's and they got a ball it's the classic shot and here comes an
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:15.880]  armored vehicle hitting them with L rad I mean this is these cops are just mad
[1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:20.200]  dogs like mad dogs that have tasted blood in a feeding frenzy I mean little
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:23.400]  kids are bad now and because they're saying no one's allowed on the streets
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:30.400]  no one go in your houses you know hitting the I mean what is that Bob I
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:35.400]  can tell him as we better start taking names there's gonna be retribution for
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:41.520]  stuff like that but I mean why would police drive through neighborhoods
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:45.600]  where there are no protesters on you can see on the video is the cameras
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:48.480]  panning and the photos we've got a separate incidents and you've got
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:52.200]  families on their front porches and doing them say they have this video but
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:54.720]  they're too busy to try to upload it because they're running on the streets
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:58.520]  and their laptop was crapping out last night they stayed up late trying to do
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:03.280]  it but the point is is that they're running is that is that they've got
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:08.080]  video they say of people on their front porches Douglas has this just just
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:12.920]  just literally being hit with the L rad going why I mean you I mean now in
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:17.800]  America you can't be on your porch well this is one of two reasons they were
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:24.760]  the word it want to stir up an uprising by attacking people in this way or they
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:30.200]  just plain demented well I think it's like a bully likes to sit on top of you
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:33.560]  and spit your face and punch you and I just think it's a you know they've been
[1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:36.920]  told let them know their search let them know you're in charge they admit the
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:43.000]  black uniforms and masks are for intimidation well that's that's true but
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  how can a real man and I'm not saying I'm some tough guy or something but I
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:52.040]  would be ashamed of messing with weak people you know I mean I don't I would
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:56.560]  be ashamed my instincts are leave weak people alone but boy some big guy starts
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:50:00.960]  up with me I mean that gets me fired up like I mean is it that how you're
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:04.840]  supposed to be that a warrior wants to fight other warriors not go around
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:10.880]  messing with nine-year-old kids and 95 pound women absolutely and you're right
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:16.880]  that's normality that's why normal people would react to that and people
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:22.200]  will pick on children and in families that are non-combatants if you want
[1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:27.440]  they're either demented or they're trying to get these people to start
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:32.520]  shooting at them or something well they're out of their minds is what they
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:36.080]  are I mean I mean this is insane
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:43.760]  amazing by the way Dave Mustaine is on Rob is the producer that handled that he
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:49.440]  left town on short notice didn't get Dave Mustaine's home number he's at right
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:53.280]  now he's obvious and so we've got that now Dave Mustaine is coming up start of

[1:58:50.760 --> 1:58:54.760]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:59:04.760]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:10.760]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[1:59:10.760 --> 1:59:12.760]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:29.760]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:37.880]  The first U.S. president to sit as the chairman of the United Nations Security Council, the
[2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:38.880]  15 member.
[2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:41.760]  That's the only group that can really vote and has power.
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:44.640]  The General Assembly has no power.
[2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:47.040]  Seeing in called him president of the world.
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:50.680]  And he was shaking when he gabbled it in two days ago.
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:52.720]  Shaking with pleasure.
[2:00:52.720 --> 2:00:56.360]  U.S. Ambassador Rice behind him was shaking.
[2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:58.760]  Henry Kissinger was shaking in the audience.
[2:00:58.760 --> 2:01:04.840]  This is the New World Order, the eugenics world government now coming into fruition.
[2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:10.880]  We are joined by Dave Mustaine, the founder and lead guitarist and lead singer of Megadeth.
[2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:12.280]  Guitarist lead singer of Megadeth.
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:13.280]  Megadeth.com.
[2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:15.320]  The new album is in game.
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:23.000]  And I just want to say that growing up 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 today, I have always
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.740]  loved Megadeth because the lyrics.
[2:01:25.740 --> 2:01:30.360]  I didn't even really understand him when I was 12, 14, 15 years old, 20 years old.
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:34.960]  But then as I learned about the New World Order, the eugenics, the master plan, it really
[2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:35.960]  did influence me.
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:37.680]  And I didn't even realize how much it did.
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:40.960]  A man way before his time understanding what was coming.
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:43.480]  Most of their covers are about the UN and world government.
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:44.960]  And now it's all happening.
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:46.280]  Dave Mustaine joining us.
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:47.280]  Thank you so much, sir.
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:49.600]  You're welcome, Alex.
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:51.240]  What do you think about what's happening?
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:52.680]  World government being announced.
[2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:54.080]  It's pretty frightening.
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:55.080]  It's pretty frightening.
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:58.480]  And I have to be really careful when I do my interviews and talk about a lot of stuff
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:03.760]  because you have to be objective, and you have to give people the right to think out
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:04.760]  of the box.
[2:02:04.760 --> 2:02:08.040]  But I think you and I agree on a lot of things.
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:14.720]  And especially, I want to tell you thanks for inspiring me to look into the whole end
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:16.440]  game film.
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:21.480]  And I actually had discovered this document through watching an inspirational video.
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:27.880]  And then I know we've spoken before, and that was privileged for me because I believe
[2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:29.400]  you're a patriot.
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:33.280]  And I think our country needs more people like you.
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:41.040]  And as far as having our record called end game, I think it's the best way to thank somebody
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:46.480]  used to bring credit where credit's due, so thanks.
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:48.960]  Well, thank you, Dave.
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:54.120]  That's just amazing that you influenced me.
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.120]  And then now with my research, I've influenced you.
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:02:58.840]  It's kind of the circle is complete.
[2:02:58.840 --> 2:02:59.840]  Almost.
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:02.120]  Now we just need one big boom.
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:07.320]  Well, I tell you, I mean, my wife is freaked out because she researches all this and she
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:09.480]  says, it's happening.
[2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:13.880]  It's world government, world taxes, world carbon taxes.
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:16.400]  We're going to go to break in a moment and some stations join us.
[2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:24.000]  But Dave, tell us about the new record that's already, from what I've seen the news, exploding
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:25.440]  up the charts end game.
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:31.240]  Well, the new record we have recorded in a studio that I own in San Marcos, California.
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:35.480]  I moved back to San Diego after the lawsuit with Ellison.
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:39.160]  I just didn't want to be in the same city with them, so we moved.
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:45.360]  And then when I started doing this record, of course, I have a real free world kind of
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:47.840]  thinking with my lyrics and stuff.
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:53.040]  So it was just going to be more of the same with this record just continuing my idea to
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:56.120]  raise awareness and to help people think.
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:04:02.160]  I may not be right, but I'm certainly right to inspire people to question.
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:06.400]  And this record has a lot of topics and it talks about the collapse of the financial
[2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:07.400]  institutions.
[2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:10.960]  I went to school and I got licensed by the state and federal government to work on Wall
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:12.360]  Street as a stockbroker.
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:17.040]  I figured, you know, being in the music business, most people in the music business aren't
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:21.120]  very smart when it comes to their money, so I wanted to be smart and educate myself about
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  that.
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:25.360]  And along the way, you learn so much, the more that you're willing to exercise your
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:30.520]  brain, the more that you discover that it's just frightening, you know, watching the
[2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:35.080]  zeitgeist clip and then, you know, knowing all the stuff that's going on with the marrow
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:36.600]  and so on and so forth.
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:41.480]  You know, these are all things that are pretty, you know, pretty atypical conspiracy theories
[2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:42.480]  and stuff.
[2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:46.040]  But I mean, if you really think that if just one second you say, okay, maybe this isn't
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:47.040]  a conspiracy.
[2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:48.840]  Dave, we've got a break.
[2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:49.840]  We've got a break.
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:50.840]  The satellite makes us break.
[2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:51.840]  Stay right there.
[2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:55.320]  We'll be right back with Dave Mustaine, the founder of Megadeth.
[2:04:55.320 --> 2:05:00.600]  Stay with us.
[2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:03.920]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:07.760]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:12.200]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.

[2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:21.840]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:22.840]  for free.
[2:05:22.840 --> 2:05:26.520]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:31.360]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:35.720]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:37.840]  through painful power outages again.
[2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:40.280]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:46.160]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to MySolarBackup.com and
[2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:48.040]  get off the grid today.

[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:37.360]  You need to look out for yourself.
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:39.880]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:06:39.880 --> 2:06:43.720]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your
[2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:44.720]  loved ones.

[2:06:55.360 --> 2:07:03.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:08.320]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:09.320]  do you want?
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:11.320]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:07:11.320 --> 2:07:16.360]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:17.600]  How much do you want?
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:18.680]  When do you want it?
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:20.600]  Now or after the battle starts.
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:21.720]  When will you need it?
[2:07:21.720 --> 2:07:23.840]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:25.200]  Will there be any food?
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:26.640]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:30.800]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:31.960]  and be immunized?
[2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:35.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:35.760 --> 2:07:39.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:40.600]  How much will you need?
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:41.600]  We don't know.
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:42.600]  How much do you want?
[2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:43.600]  All you can get.
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:44.600]  I'm Alex Jones.

[2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:04.280]  People love and I'm talking about serious death fans, serious mega death fans.
[2:56:04.280 --> 2:56:08.280]  They love the new album and I think it's going to be one of your biggest and greatest.
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:14.280]  I mean, out of the gates, it's already happening and I just think this is a really exciting direction you're going in.
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:19.280]  I mean, you're still going in the same direction, but you've kind of kicked it up a notch in intensity.
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:21.280]  Are you getting the same feedback?
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:23.280]  Well, we've got a lot of great reviews.
[2:56:23.280 --> 2:56:33.280]  You know, by no means does anything over yet and this band would be really blessed if we were able to gain some of your following.
[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:45.280]  And basically, you and I are speaking the same language, we're singing from the same hymnal, but what we're trying to do is get these tours out of the way.
[2:56:45.280 --> 2:56:52.280]  You can plan on us being back in the studio or me visiting you out there for some barbecue in November.
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:53.280]  Man, that is awesome.
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:56.280]  I'll come out whenever I'm out in your neck of the woods.
[2:56:56.280 --> 2:56:59.280]  Maybe we can hook up for some barbecue, but it is better here.
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:00.280]  You're out in California.
[2:57:00.280 --> 2:57:02.280]  I guess they got good sushi there.
[2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:05.280]  You would say everybody says they got good sushi out here.
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:06.280]  And you know what?
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:10.280]  You go into one of these places and it's like, I didn't know it was green.
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:13.280]  So, anyway, back to what we were talking about before.
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:20.280]  You know, it would be really great to invite you and your crew down to our concert too if you want to bring a film crew down there.
[2:57:20.280 --> 2:57:23.280]  And we can talk some more there and show you a little bit about what I do.
[2:57:23.280 --> 2:57:25.280]  Absolutely killer.
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:28.280]  Well, Dave, we'll stay in touch with you and your management.
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:32.280]  And you are really trailblazing with your record label.
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:33.280]  People should support it.
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:34.280]  It is independent.
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:35.280]  It is Maverick.
[2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:37.280]  It is original and authentic.
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:40.280]  Dave Mustaine, founder of Megadeth.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:41.280]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:45.280]  The new album is in game.
[2:57:45.280 --> 2:57:46.280]  Dave, thank you so much.
[2:57:46.280 --> 2:57:47.280]  You're welcome, Alex.
[2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:48.280]  Take care.
[2:57:48.280 --> 2:57:49.280]  All right, we'll talk to you again soon.
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:51.280]  Well, that is exciting.
[2:57:51.280 --> 2:57:52.280]  There goes Dave.
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:55.280]  Man, again, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:57:55.280 --> 2:57:58.280]  And Muse is doing interviews, seeing 9-Elevens at Inside Job.
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:57:59.280]  They've been on the show.
[2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:00.280]  Bellamy.
[2:58:00.280 --> 2:58:02.280]  It's one of the number one bands right now.
[2:58:02.280 --> 2:58:11.280]  If I told you some of the other music icons I've talked to or that I know, or that I know through other people that are aware of the New World Order, you wouldn't believe it.
[2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:14.280]  The Hollywood people, you wouldn't believe it.
[2:58:14.280 --> 2:58:15.280]  There is an awakening.
[2:58:15.280 --> 2:58:18.280]  The general public doesn't want world government, world tyranny.
[2:58:18.280 --> 2:58:21.280]  That's why at the G20, they've got to have the police come out.
[2:58:21.280 --> 2:58:28.280]  In fact, I meant when Dave was on to play that armored vehicle audio and video where they're saying, you are not allowed to assemble.
[2:58:28.280 --> 2:58:34.280]  In fact, we'll come back with that after this break, and then we'll come in with the music after that, John.
[2:58:34.280 --> 2:58:39.280]  And then we're going to get a report from the G20 from our reporters on the ground, and then Bob Chapman pops back in.
[2:58:39.280 --> 2:58:40.280]  Stay with us.
[2:58:40.280 --> 2:58:42.280]  Yeah.
[2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:45.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:45.280 --> 2:58:50.280]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:50.280 --> 2:58:53.280]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:58:53.280 --> 2:58:57.280]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:58:57.280 --> 2:59:02.280]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:59:02.280 --> 2:59:06.280]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:59:06.280 --> 2:59:12.280]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:59:12.280 --> 2:59:16.280]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:59:16.280 --> 2:59:21.280]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:59:21.280 --> 2:59:28.280]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:30.280]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:59:30.280 --> 2:59:38.280]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.

[2:59:48.280 --> 3:00:15.280]  Don't wait. Call today.
[3:00:15.280 --> 3:00:21.280]  What do you mean I don't believe in God? Talk to Him every day.
[3:00:21.280 --> 3:00:28.280]  What do you mean I don't support your system? I go to court when I have to.
[3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:35.280]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time? I've got nothing better to do.
[3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:44.280]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills? What do you think I'm broke?
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:01:00.280]  There's a new way. I'll be the first in line. But it better work this time.
[3:01:00.280 --> 3:01:07.280]  What do you mean I hurt your feelings? I didn't know you had any feelings.
[3:01:07.280 --> 3:01:14.280]  What do you mean I ain't kind? Just not your kind.
[3:01:14.280 --> 3:01:20.280]  What do you mean I couldn't be the president of the United States of America?
[3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:29.280]  Tell me something. It's still we, the people, right?
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:38.280]  There's a new way. I'll be the first in line. But it better work this time.
[3:01:38.280 --> 3:02:03.280]  This time. Peace sales. Peace sales. I love that end part. It's coming up. Break it up, baby. Yeah! We're taking on the new world. Yeah! Yeah! Let them see your war face. Yeah!
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:27.280]  We used to go to meet people from school that wanted to get in the fight. We'd pull into a field, this cranking up, slide out of the car and just start going wild.
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:36.280]  But you know what? I'd put all that energy into fighting the new world order now. Crank it up!
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:39.280]  Peace. Here it is.
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:45.280]  Peace sales. Peace.
[3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:47.280]  He says
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:52.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:55.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:02:55.280 --> 3:02:58.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:01.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:03:06.280 --> 3:03:09.280]  Man, that is rockin', baby!
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:11.280]  Yeah!
[3:03:11.280 --> 3:03:13.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:15.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:23.280]  He's joining the fight against the New World Order. He was always there, but now he's 100%. Very exciting.
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:32.280]  Let's end this segment with the thugs of the New World Order broadcasting almost the same intro from his new title track Endgame.
[3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:42.280]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:52.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:22.280]  He sells for new spire
[3:04:42.280 --> 3:04:54.280]  Trust your gut. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. We're going directly live to the G20 with world government being announced straight ahead.
[3:05:12.280 --> 3:05:22.280]  Battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:05:22.280 --> 3:05:32.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:32.280 --> 3:05:44.280]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:44.280 --> 3:06:00.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:06:00.280 --> 3:06:10.280]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[3:06:10.280 --> 3:06:15.280]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:06:15.280 --> 3:06:31.280]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[3:07:00.280 --> 3:07:09.280]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine. I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[3:07:09.280 --> 3:07:22.280]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form. PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant. There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours not minutes.
[3:07:22.280 --> 3:07:33.280]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection. You can find out all about it and order it online at nogerms.info. That's nogerms.info.
[3:07:33.280 --> 3:07:42.280]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[3:07:42.280 --> 3:07:53.280]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs. Do try PureWorks available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[3:07:53.280 --> 3:08:12.280]  Go to nogerms.info. That's nogerms.info. Be well and stay well. Best MZ.
[3:08:12.280 --> 3:08:27.280]  Thank you for joining us.
[3:08:27.280 --> 3:08:34.280]  We've got one trailer out there. We're going to have other incredible trailers the next few weeks. It's going to go on presale tomorrow at infowars.com.
[3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:46.280]  When you order first, that means that in the orders it ships out first and we're probably going to, just like with Camp FEMA, probably going to start shipping this a few days before October 21st on that Wednesday.
[3:08:46.280 --> 3:08:54.280]  We're going to shoot to start shipping Monday with UPS. Everybody gets it within three days. Most people in the U.S. depending on where you live within two days.
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:09:04.280]  Everybody will get it on the 21st of October pre-order today at infowars.com. In fact, I meant to get in this morning and tell them to go ahead and get it up on the shopping cart.
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:12.280]  We haven't done that. Kurt Nemo is finishing up the Fall of the Republic sub pages because we've all been racing with other work.
[3:09:12.280 --> 3:09:20.280]  In fact, can we put falltherepublic.com up on screen for folks? Now, this isn't the video cover, but we'll show you the video cover coming up this weekend.
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:28.280]  You can post it on infowars.com. We'll probably even this afternoon get it up for presale Friday afternoon, Friday evening.
[3:09:28.280 --> 3:09:36.280]  Now, almost every new film I make, I say this is my greatest film ever because each film gets better.
[3:09:36.280 --> 3:09:58.280]  We saw what we went from America destroyed by design to police state 2000 to police state 2 the takeover right through police state 3, matrix of evil, road to tyranny, martial law, and all the other documentaries like terror storm and the order of death and dark secrets inside
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:10.280]  Bohemian Grove and American dictators and end game was a whole another level information wise. It's the total combo that really gives you a good, good view on everything.
[3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:18.280]  The Obama deception, the biggest film we've ever released, the most viral, the most successful, the most DVDs handed out people have made copies of and given it to people.
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:28.280]  The biggest film we've had conservatively over 100 million people seen my films free online. I mean, it's got to be over 25 million now just with Obama deception.
[3:10:28.280 --> 3:10:39.280]  And of course, I executive produced loose change final cuts seen by millions. The point is, is that when I tell you that fall, the Republic blows everything we've ever made away.
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:49.280]  Believe me, my most expensive film was about $120,000 to make. That was in game.
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:11:02.280]  Obama deception because we rushed the making of it and it's really good was only about 80 grand. This film, for me, it sounds like nothing to people that are, you know, big, huge movie makers $200,000 budget to give you an idea.
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:11.280]  And, and, and six months making it. I mean, I'm up here till one to at night, six, seven days a week. This thing is unbelievable.
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:23.280]  I mean, and oh, here's another big announcement about it. It's fall, the Republic volume one. We ended up about a month ago with a four hour film, all this new info coming in.
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:33.280]  And I said, there's no way I can't make it. Now that the film is two hours, 22 minutes long. No, 20, 24 minutes. I added, I made everybody shoot some more stuff last night on some other issues.
[3:11:33.280 --> 3:11:45.280]  We just added it, but that was what I was finally done this morning. That's why Aaron's not here. He was up all night fall of the Republic is 224 minutes long.
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:58.280]  It has 19 interviews, but also footage on the ground, voiceover documents. I mean, video clips, the research that went into it. No film I've ever made has as much research and it's part one.
[3:11:58.280 --> 3:12:04.280]  It covers how the banks did the takeover, the derivatives, the scam, their world government plan.
[3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:19.280]  It gets into the eugenics, TV, mind control, how they control society, the citizen spy networks, just ladies and gentlemen, it's got Jesse Ventura, Max Kaiser, Bob Bowman, Webster Tarpley, George Humphrey.
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:23.280]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:34.280]  In fact, I've got to get a full list of that. 19 interviews. I put people on 17 airplanes to fly to Canada and California and Florida.
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:44.280]  John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny. I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:53.280]  Oathkeepers. We went to 10 cities in California. 17 missions. We flew two groups of people here to be interviewed.
[3:12:53.280 --> 3:13:06.280]  I'm in the film and the voiceover is the best boil down script of key information. The analysis, again, it's going on sale this afternoon tomorrow.
[3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:17.280]  In the next few weeks, we've got two big trailers coming out that'll give you a sneak peek at it. Start preordering tonight or tomorrow when it goes up, falloftherepublic.com.
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:25.280]  And that says infowars.com, fall of the Republic. The main site's not up. So people can just go to falloftherepublic.com and get it.
[3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:29.280]  Okay, good. Yeah. So the actual URL is falloftherepublic.com.
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:37.280]  I'm just looking at infowars, URL subpage version of it there on screen.
[3:13:37.280 --> 3:13:42.280]  But the point is they've denied world government was here. They've denied world government was happening.
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:49.280]  They've denied world government was a reality. And then now they've had to admit it's all real and we go back over their history, everything I'm telling you.
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:57.280]  I was watching this film last night at about 1.30 in the morning after I got off coast to coast AM, been working on it before and then after.
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:05.280]  And I was, I said to, to Aaron and to Rob Jacobson, who really deserve as much credit as, as, as myself or anybody else in this film.
[3:14:05.280 --> 3:14:11.280]  And they're just, I couldn't do it without these two men and their dedication because you can get more people on it, but you have something like this.
[3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:17.280]  It has to be a small number so that I'm not comparing myself to Stanley Kubrick, but he, people said you'd go to his sets.
[3:14:17.280 --> 3:14:22.280]  There'd be 10 people on him go to a regular Hollywood set. There'd be hundreds or thousands. It's the same thing here.
[3:14:22.280 --> 3:14:37.280]  It's just a very small knit group. Burmese has worked on it. Rob do Jason Douglas, Mike McWhorter, Mr. Dill, everybody who was involved in this Glenn Dill.
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:48.280]  The guys that did the music, Derek Einkauf, Craig, Will Jones, all the guys are such great musicians because we got three guys at work here that have or in the same band here in Austin,
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:59.280]  that the music is title track in a major motion picture. Good. And I love Mr. Reynolds who we've used in other films and he's great.
[3:14:59.280 --> 3:15:06.280]  And he's gotten orchestras together for it. We shouldn't have the time to do that, but this turned out just as good and different.
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:19.280]  So Rob Jacobson made some of the music. I mean, it is just, it is a out of the park success. This is going to be devastating to the New World Order and all the glory goes to God.
[3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:28.280]  I tell you, to bust your butt like this, to get black circles around your eyes, to accelerate your aging, you know, working so hard to your hair falling out.
[3:15:28.280 --> 3:15:38.280]  I don't care. I love just spending myself on a worthy cause to know those dedications, those passions to be able to make something like fall the Republic.
[3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:45.280]  It's volume one, volume two is going to be eugenics, mind control, the concentration camps and how to defeat them.
[3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:49.280]  There's a lot of solutions in this film as well.
[3:15:49.280 --> 3:15:58.280]  Gerald Salente's in it. I mean, the list goes on and on. The point is this is heads above before the films were a little better than the before.
[3:15:58.280 --> 3:16:04.280]  This is a whole quantum leap and we have better computers and more research and we're better at what we do now.
[3:16:04.280 --> 3:16:15.280]  It is a quantum leap, a whole nother level about any film I have ever produced.
[3:16:15.280 --> 3:16:20.280]  It is a quantum leap. The IT guys helping us with the systems to get it done. Everybody.
[3:16:20.280 --> 3:16:28.280]  And you, the listeners that have supported us, you especially need credit for your financial support, buying the other books and videos and t-shirts and materials and supporting our sponsors.
[3:16:28.280 --> 3:16:39.280]  You have made this possible where we have the financing to send 17 crews out at around $5,000 per trip.
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:46.280]  I don't know what 17 times 5,000. I've done the math and the total budget of this thing, the graphics, everything.
[3:16:46.280 --> 3:16:51.280]  It's just so fulfilling to be on the right side of history. It's so fulfilling to know the truth.
[3:16:51.280 --> 3:16:57.280]  It's so fulfilling to be proven right. It's so fulfilling when we get the death threats and the COINTELPRO and the lies and the attacks.
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:03.280]  Each one worse than the next to know they're attacking us because we are doing good, because we are having an effect in history.
[3:17:03.280 --> 3:17:11.280]  We do matter with this species. And the way the film ends, I'm going to leave that as a surprise.
[3:17:11.280 --> 3:17:18.280]  Follow the Republic. I'm going to quit waxing here, eloquent about it, but it is just, follow the Republic.
[3:17:18.280 --> 3:17:22.280]  It goes on pre-sale tonight or tomorrow. I'm not sure when. We've got to get it up all properly at infowars.com.
[3:17:22.280 --> 3:17:29.280]  You can start writing to us. It's 1995. You can start writing to us at 3,001. South Lamar.
[3:17:29.280 --> 3:17:33.280]  Sweet 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04. Of course, we're not really using that address anymore.
[3:17:33.280 --> 3:17:40.280]  It's better to send it to InfoWars, PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[3:17:40.280 --> 3:17:44.280]  PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60 or InfoWars.com.
[3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:47.280]  And of course, October 21st, it will debut in super high quality.
[3:17:47.280 --> 3:17:50.280]  We're even trying to put it out on the web in actual high death.
[3:17:50.280 --> 3:17:57.280]  I think we're going to be able to do that. It's close to high death right now in the highest quality, but we're having a bunch of versions at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:17:57.280 --> 3:18:03.280]  Okay, I got my guys holding. Let's go to Jason Bermas and then Jason Douglas also on the phone from the middle of the crowd.
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:06.280]  What's happened since an hour and a half ago when I talked to you?
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:13.280]  Well, now we're on mobile, Alex. The police force has a much greater presence as we reach downtown.
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:16.280]  I told you you're going to march in. They're going to surround you.
[3:18:16.280 --> 3:18:25.280]  It's very possible. I'm not sure where this is ending right now, but I've got video of hundreds of police officers now mass at the block.
[3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:28.280]  Many of them in riot gear. They have been a little overzealous.
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:35.280]  I mean, some people are throwing the peace sign up, but it's, you know, a young lady, again, not weighing more than 105 pounds,
[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:41.280]  dared to put one of her feet on the sidewalk next to me and she was threatened with a batoning. I got it on video.
[3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:48.280]  I mean, come on. You know, she just, you know, I just keep running into Cindy Sheehan and the masses of thousands of people.
[3:18:48.280 --> 3:18:53.280]  And Cindy was standing next to her. She couldn't believe that he even laced her baton. I couldn't believe it.
[3:18:53.280 --> 3:18:59.280]  You know, it's a little bit of controlled madness right now, Alex. It's pretty crazy.
[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:05.280]  We are mobile yet again, stopped at the Capitol for a while while there was some sort of a concert going on.
[3:19:05.280 --> 3:19:12.280]  And right now I can see, I believe it's the 7th Street or Clemente Bridge. I'm not sure which one.
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:21.280]  I can tell you I'm at the corner of 6th Avenue and it may be 6th and 7th Street where they converge.
[3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:27.280]  And there are thousands of people and hundreds of police officers courting off side streets right now.
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:28.280]  I'm filming them.
[3:19:28.280 --> 3:19:32.280]  Yeah, that's it. They're getting ready to lock down the main protest. You guys need to split up.
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:37.280]  Somebody at the front, somebody at the back with a plan to get out of there quick if they start closing it down.
[3:19:37.280 --> 3:19:40.280]  Stay there, Jason. I want more from you and Jason Douglas as well.
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:44.280]  Jason Douglas, Jason Burmese, Rob Doodoo doing a great job.
[3:19:44.280 --> 3:19:48.280]  Pray for him on the ground at the G20 Open World Government being announced.
[3:19:48.280 --> 3:19:54.280]  What an insane show today. Dave Mustaine on the heels of Congressman Ron Paul and Congressman Grayson.
[3:19:54.280 --> 3:19:58.280]  Yesterday, more huge guests coming up in the next few weeks. Stay with us.
[3:20:03.280 --> 3:20:06.280]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[3:20:06.280 --> 3:20:09.280]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[3:20:09.280 --> 3:20:12.280]  Eat Foods Direct just finished developing our new, new traversal foods.

[3:20:23.280 --> 3:20:27.280]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.

[3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:05.280]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources.
[3:21:05.280 --> 3:21:08.280]  One of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[3:21:08.280 --> 3:21:09.280]  I get it.
[3:21:09.280 --> 3:21:13.280]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job,
[3:21:13.280 --> 3:21:16.280]  that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy,
[3:21:16.280 --> 3:21:18.280]  that social security would be there for you.
[3:21:18.280 --> 3:21:20.280]  That's not what's happening.
[3:21:20.280 --> 3:21:24.280]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:26.280]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:28.280]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[3:21:28.280 --> 3:21:32.280]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:36.280]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[3:21:36.280 --> 3:21:42.280]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:45.280]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:46.280]  You should, too.
[3:21:46.280 --> 3:21:47.280]  Find out what they know.
[3:21:47.280 --> 3:21:50.280]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[3:21:50.280 --> 3:21:51.280]  Free.

[3:21:54.280 --> 3:21:56.280]  800-686-2237.
[3:21:56.280 --> 3:22:00.280]  That's 800-686-2237.
[3:22:00.280 --> 3:22:06.280]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:09.280]  I went to ground Sierra and we knew what to do.
[3:22:09.280 --> 3:22:11.280]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:22:11.280 --> 3:22:17.280]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:26.280]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:22:26.280 --> 3:22:33.280]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:22:33.280 --> 3:22:36.280]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:22:36.280 --> 3:22:42.280]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:22:42.280 --> 3:22:45.280]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:51.280]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[3:22:51.280 --> 3:22:54.280]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:22:54.280 --> 3:23:00.280]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:31.280]  Truth Rising captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[3:23:31.280 --> 3:23:39.280]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily supports a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[3:23:39.280 --> 3:23:43.280]  And liquid zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:46.280]  Although your list of elements may be endless, the solution is simple.

[3:24:00.280 --> 3:24:25.280]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:32.280]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[3:24:32.280 --> 3:24:35.280]  This is yesterday in Pittsburgh. Same things going on now.
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:42.280]  This is not a flashback to Police State 2000 shot in 1999 with the Marines drilling to take over U.S. cities saying the same thing.
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:46.280]  This is what the military Northcom Homeland Security is for.
[3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:47.280]  It is for you.
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:52.280]  Mainstream news announcing Obama's president of the world bringing us into the New World Order.
[3:24:52.280 --> 3:24:58.280]  Those are the headlines. 8,000-plus articles in Google News with the term New World Order in them.
[3:24:58.280 --> 3:25:02.280]  Jason Burmes, what is it like to see this actually unfolding?
[3:25:02.280 --> 3:25:05.280]  Honestly, it's extremely encouraging, Alex.
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:08.280]  This process has gone much better than the one yesterday.
[3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:11.280]  Again, I'm not hoping for disaster at the end.
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:14.280]  We are currently crossing the bridge by the thousands.
[3:25:14.280 --> 3:25:18.280]  When you see a helicopter aerial shot of this, you will be astounded.
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:22.280]  Again, thousands of people trying to get their message out.
[3:25:22.280 --> 3:25:24.280]  Riot police lining the streets.
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:27.280]  I don't know what's going to be in store for us on the other side of the bridge.
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:36.280]  As I said, as we approach this, the riot police and the military presence became much, much greater.
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:40.280]  Jason, you're going to be live Sunday, 6 to 9 p.m.
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:47.280]  But I want to have you, Rob do and Jason Douglas in studio in the first hour Sunday when you're back.
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:51.280]  And if you guys can come in and get a few of the key video clips like them,
[3:25:51.280 --> 3:25:56.280]  what Douglas says he has of them, sound canoning people on their front porch and little kids,
[3:25:56.280 --> 3:26:01.280]  we'll play some clips of that on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.TV on Sunday ahead of your show.
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:03.280]  I know they've got to get back to their families. They've been gone all week.
[3:26:03.280 --> 3:26:07.280]  But make sure the guys know that I want them here Sunday if they can do it.
[3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:09.280]  If not, you can come in and have the...
[3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:13.280]  As soon as I get off that plane, I will start capturing video.
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:17.280]  This is just too important not to get out to the masses as soon as possible.
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:20.280]  Yeah, we should have probably sent another just a web person.
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:25.280]  You could hand the stuff off too to do it, but then we didn't send the right equipment.
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:29.280]  But that's okay. We're not professional soldiers in the Info War here.
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:33.280]  We're professional amateurs doing the best we can to fight the New World Order.
[3:26:33.280 --> 3:26:39.280]  Let's go to Jason Douglas. Stay there, Burmese, but I want to go back to Jason Douglas.
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:43.280]  Two Jason's here. Douglas, what have you been seeing happening?
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:47.280]  Well, right now I'm at 6th Avenue and Wood Street.
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:51.280]  And basically what they're doing is as we move block by block,
[3:26:51.280 --> 3:26:55.280]  they collapse the group of police officers.
[3:26:55.280 --> 3:26:59.280]  And right now it's about a hundred foot deep of police officers
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:03.280]  basically pushing the marchers to some undisclosed location.
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:06.280]  So as I said, they've now gotten behind you.
[3:27:06.280 --> 3:27:10.280]  They're going to be waiting in front and block you off all at one spot.
[3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:14.280]  Right, that is exactly what they're doing. Every time I get to a new block,
[3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:18.280]  there's another collapse of soldiers.
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:22.280]  Yeah, Burmese said that there are army there.
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:26.280]  Obviously, we haven't seen it. Have you seen the video of snatch and grab teams
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:30.280]  grabbing peaceful demonstrators and shoving them in police cars with the army driving them
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:34.280]  and driving them away? I haven't seen any video of it.
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:38.280]  I've seen patty wagons. I've seen them zoom away through the crowd.
[3:27:38.280 --> 3:27:42.280]  Well, obviously you're on the ground so you can't see the video. What I'm telling you is we're here
[3:27:42.280 --> 3:27:46.280]  seeing it all. That's why I stayed here at the command center so we can kind of coordinate.
[3:27:46.280 --> 3:27:50.280]  There's got to be a general here in our little operation. I wish I was there with you.
[3:27:50.280 --> 3:27:54.280]  Like I said, I've seen the patty wagons come in and then zoom away
[3:27:54.280 --> 3:28:00.280]  but I haven't seen with my own eyes and been able to capture it on video.
[3:28:00.280 --> 3:28:06.280]  Burmese is saying he has seen them Billy Club people threaten to Billy Club people.
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:10.280]  Yep. Well, I was standing in front of the line in between the anarchists
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:14.280]  or supposed anarchists and the military line
[3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:18.280]  and they all had rifles and then for some reason I can't figure out what it was.
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:22.280]  They just started pointing the rifles right in our face. I had a tear gas
[3:28:22.280 --> 3:28:26.280]  two inches from my face. You're telling me
[3:28:26.280 --> 3:28:30.280]  that they were pointing rifles. They look like shotguns?
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:34.280]  Yeah, you know, it looked bigger than a shotgun.
[3:28:34.280 --> 3:28:38.280]  It looked like a grenade launcher is what it looked like.
[3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:42.280]  It's probably a big tear gas launcher but it can kill you up close.
[3:28:42.280 --> 3:28:46.280]  Remember the Red Sox? They killed some girl, walked out of a bar
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:50.280]  and they shot her at ten feet in the eye and it pushed her eye back in her brain.
[3:28:50.280 --> 3:28:54.280]  You have video of them just for no reason aiming the weapons at you.
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:28:58.280]  That's what I got exactly because I was right in the middle of changing tapes when that happened
[3:28:58.280 --> 3:29:02.280]  and I slammed the cape in and I pressed report as fast as I could
[3:29:02.280 --> 3:29:06.280]  but I also wet myself a little bit so
[3:29:06.280 --> 3:29:10.280]  it was pretty intense. Did you really
[3:29:10.280 --> 3:29:14.280]  bite yourself? No, not really. You know
[3:29:14.280 --> 3:29:18.280]  all of a sudden they got very aggressive and started moving towards this
[3:29:18.280 --> 3:29:22.280]  and pointing weapons and I personally have never had anything that big.
[3:29:22.280 --> 3:29:26.280]  That's what Burma said. He said just some woman stepped up on the sidewalk
[3:29:26.280 --> 3:29:30.280]  and the guy took a billy club and said, I'll smash your teeth in, whore.
[3:29:30.280 --> 3:29:34.280]  We've seen videos of that but we can't play it here. We're playing them without audio
[3:29:34.280 --> 3:29:38.280]  because it's cops cussing, citizens cussing. People just are
[3:29:38.280 --> 3:29:42.280]  videotaping a cop and you see him, the cop goes, I'm about to beat the hell out of you
[3:29:42.280 --> 3:29:46.280]  bitch. You know, it is and he adds a few things we can't say on air.
[3:29:46.280 --> 3:29:50.280]  Stay there. Final report from you straight ahead.
[3:29:50.280 --> 3:29:54.280]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:54.280 --> 3:29:58.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:58.280 --> 3:30:02.280]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want
[3:30:02.280 --> 3:30:06.280]  each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:10.280]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[3:30:10.280 --> 3:30:14.280]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present
[3:30:14.280 --> 3:30:18.280]  in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[3:30:18.280 --> 3:30:22.280]  reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases. Now what are you
[3:30:22.280 --> 3:30:26.280]  going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a
[3:30:26.280 --> 3:30:30.280]  low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[3:30:30.280 --> 3:30:34.280]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[3:30:34.280 --> 3:30:38.280]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis
[3:30:38.280 --> 3:30:42.280]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques. That's right, clean water
[3:30:42.280 --> 3:30:46.280]  right from the air you breathe. Order today by calling

[3:31:02.280 --> 3:31:06.280]  It's here after a year in production
[3:31:06.280 --> 3:31:10.280]  and traveling the distant lands. My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[3:31:10.280 --> 3:31:14.280]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror
[3:31:14.280 --> 3:31:18.280]  attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[3:31:18.280 --> 3:31:22.280]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[3:31:22.280 --> 3:31:26.280]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[3:31:26.280 --> 3:31:30.280]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program
[3:31:30.280 --> 3:31:34.280]  to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police
[3:31:34.280 --> 3:31:38.280]  torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more. Terror Storm
[3:31:38.280 --> 3:31:42.280]  is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology
[3:31:42.280 --> 3:31:46.280]  of government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be
[3:31:46.280 --> 3:31:50.280]  truly informed must see. Get your copy today at infowars.com

[3:33:12.280 --> 3:33:16.280]  We've got our people on the ground, Rob do, Jason Douglas, Jason Burmese
[3:33:16.280 --> 3:33:20.280]  they're coming back tomorrow. Full report for UN Studio Sunday
[3:33:20.280 --> 3:33:24.280]  with exclusive video as well that our team has shot. We've never had
[3:33:24.280 --> 3:33:28.280]  do on these days except for when the military tried to set
[3:33:28.280 --> 3:33:32.280]  you guys up Wednesday night but he was saying he was up on a rooftop while
[3:33:32.280 --> 3:33:36.280]  Luke Radowski was bullhorning them then they hit the crowd yesterday with a
[3:33:36.280 --> 3:33:40.280]  sound weapon and Luke tried to hold his ground for a while did a great job and everybody
[3:33:40.280 --> 3:33:44.280]  dispersed. I mean this is like out of a science fiction dystopic novel
[3:33:44.280 --> 3:33:56.280]  Douglas? Oh I hear the sound weapon. Douglas?
[3:33:56.280 --> 3:34:00.280]  Douglas this is like something out of a science fiction movie.
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:04.280]  That's exactly what this is. I mean there was a band playing
[3:34:04.280 --> 3:34:08.280]  the imperial song, the imperial story trooper song and it was so apropos
[3:34:08.280 --> 3:34:12.280]  that's exactly what this is. The only thing that's
[3:34:12.280 --> 3:34:16.280]  not the same is that they're all in different uniforms. It's people from
[3:34:16.280 --> 3:34:20.280]  all over the country, police from all over the country and National Guard
[3:34:20.280 --> 3:34:24.280]  but you know they all look like stormtroopers. And border patrol?
[3:34:24.280 --> 3:34:28.280]  And border patrol, homeland security, I mean
[3:34:28.280 --> 3:34:32.280]  it's too many to even name. Well
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:36.280]  it's incredible. Any closing thoughts?
[3:34:36.280 --> 3:34:40.280]  You know I just can't believe that this is happening
[3:34:40.280 --> 3:34:44.280]  It's like they give us 5 seconds to talk and then they push us
[3:34:44.280 --> 3:34:48.280]  and then they corral us onto this bridge right now
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:52.280]  I'm just not sure about the state of this country anymore. Was it you
[3:34:52.280 --> 3:34:56.280]  or or or Burma's that said that they had one permitted march
[3:34:56.280 --> 3:35:00.280]  yesterday and they wouldn't even allow them to march? The permitted march was
[3:35:00.280 --> 3:35:04.280]  on the 20th and they didn't allow it to go
[3:35:04.280 --> 3:35:08.280]  all the way down to the convention center. This is the closest we've gotten to the convention center
[3:35:08.280 --> 3:35:12.280]  I can see it right now. It's about a block and a half away
[3:35:12.280 --> 3:35:16.280]  Of course there's about 6 metal fences and about
[3:35:16.280 --> 3:35:20.280]  502 in between us and the convention center. Okay, I'm going to be
[3:35:20.280 --> 3:35:24.280]  here all day. If anything happens, call us. We'll go live on the video audio streams
[3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:28.280]  at infowars.com. Not on the full radio show. Wish we could but we can't
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:32.280]  stations, affiliates only have us at set times obviously with the way radio
[3:35:32.280 --> 3:35:36.280]  programming works. But we'll go live. People just watch info wars for that
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:40.280]  if that happens we may even put the prisonplanet.tv stream out for free
[3:35:40.280 --> 3:35:44.280]  we can't afford that for more than a day or so but we'll put the video stream out
[3:35:44.280 --> 3:35:48.280]  if things continue to develop. Thank you so much Jason Douglas for the great job
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:52.280]  you're doing. Keep it up, be careful, get out of there if they start attacking everybody
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:56.280]  the mission is get the video out and stay safe. God bless you
[3:35:56.280 --> 3:36:00.280]  Thank you. Let's go to a final
[3:36:00.280 --> 3:36:04.280]  comment we're going to Bob Chapman for the balance of the hour with more economic news
[3:36:04.280 --> 3:36:08.280]  on the global government announcing world tax at the end of the dollar.
[3:36:08.280 --> 3:36:12.280]  Burma, any closing comments?
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:16.280]  We were able to get over the bridge again thousands of people
[3:36:16.280 --> 3:36:20.280]  still protesting here. The police presence is not
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:24.280]  so much larger. I got a couple of dogs
[3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:28.280]  a few of them have the mussels on some of them do not have the mussels
[3:36:28.280 --> 3:36:32.280]  on. It really works with the masking right now to my left
[3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:36.280]  that they are ready to move the crowd along to
[3:36:36.280 --> 3:36:40.280]  wherever they're trying to gather us into. It does not look like I am going to be
[3:36:40.280 --> 3:36:44.280]  able to get on a sidewalk in about a block or two.
[3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:48.280]  It's just incredible Alex. I really can't wait to get back and give a full report
[3:36:48.280 --> 3:36:52.280]  when we're able to capture some of this tape and show people the footage that we...
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:56.280]  Well Jason you know they're using those dogs like in South Africa or Nazi Germany
[3:36:56.280 --> 3:37:00.280]  for intimidation. They bring them into schools and have them snap at kids
[3:37:00.280 --> 3:37:04.280]  and hide at them as they did in Goose Creek North Carolina famously.
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:08.280]  Look for an exit out of there. Why don't you get out of the crowd before
[3:37:08.280 --> 3:37:12.280]  they lock down and rubber bullet and sound cannon everybody because they have a bloodlust for the
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:16.280]  American people. We've got as you said photos and videos
[3:37:16.280 --> 3:37:20.280]  we just sent Rob to get Aaron out of bed. He worked too late last night. Aaron
[3:37:20.280 --> 3:37:24.280]  has it last night. I saw it so we can try to get it at the end of the show.
[3:37:24.280 --> 3:37:28.280]  But if they're rolling around, well you said you saw this too yesterday. Them just going through
[3:37:28.280 --> 3:37:32.280]  the neighborhood sound canoning. Broadcasting that nobody's allowed to be on the streets.
[3:37:32.280 --> 3:37:36.280]  Well yeah you know they were, again they did such a great job
[3:37:36.280 --> 3:37:40.280]  of dispersing people. There would literally be 15 or 20 people coming
[3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:44.280]  down the street you know and then there'd be 10 or 15 people
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:48.280]  just down on their churches who want nothing to do with this protest and that
[3:37:48.280 --> 3:37:52.280]  doesn't stop them from using the LRAP. It's unbelievable. It's inconceivable.
[3:37:52.280 --> 3:37:56.280]  Yet it's true. It's really starting to get loud now
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:00.280]  and I'm sure you can hear it.
[3:38:00.280 --> 3:38:04.280]  I'm going to keep you on hold and come back to you in
[3:38:04.280 --> 3:38:08.280]  five minutes as this develops okay. You got it. Just put your phone
[3:38:08.280 --> 3:38:12.280]  in your pocket or well I don't want to
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:16.280]  hang up and lose you. Just keep it with you and I'll come back to you in five minutes okay.
[3:38:16.280 --> 3:38:20.280]  Alright that's good. Well that is crazy.
[3:38:20.280 --> 3:38:24.280]  Maybe from time to time you just fade up the background while Bob Chapman's talking
[3:38:24.280 --> 3:38:28.280]  because people can hear this. Bob Chapman, you fought the communist in Europe
[3:38:28.280 --> 3:38:32.280]  in military intelligence in Berlin.
[3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:36.280]  We have a video that we broke a month ago that's finally made national news.
[3:38:36.280 --> 3:38:40.280]  It's all over Fox, CNN. In fact, queue that up with the little kids
[3:38:40.280 --> 3:38:44.280]  worshiping Obama and they said this line about Jesus loves all
[3:38:44.280 --> 3:38:48.280]  the little children. They say this poem and then they sing another song about
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:52.280]  red, yellow, black and white. They are all equal in his sight. Well they say
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:56.280]  they are all equal in Obama's sight and they sing the song. This is directly out of North
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:00.280]  Korea. This is worse than Hitler, worse than Stalin, worse than Mao.
[3:39:00.280 --> 3:39:04.280]  Paul Watson's girlfriend who was born in China
[3:39:04.280 --> 3:39:08.280]  she got really freaked out when she saw this because she's a patriot
[3:39:08.280 --> 3:39:12.280]  and she said that's what we had to do to Mao when I was a little girl was worship
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:16.280]  him and sing songs about him. I mean this is getting really sick Bob Chapman.
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:20.280]  Well I think the program is accelerating
[3:39:20.280 --> 3:39:24.280]  and the reason it is is because we've accelerated
[3:39:24.280 --> 3:39:28.280]  and we have informed the public and more and more people are
[3:39:28.280 --> 3:39:32.280]  catching on and so that's why they're doing what they're doing. I think what's
[3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:36.280]  going to come out of this G20 meeting more than anything
[3:39:36.280 --> 3:39:40.280]  else is things that they're not talking about and that is
[3:39:40.280 --> 3:39:44.280]  setting the government and the financial
[3:39:44.280 --> 3:39:48.280]  system up for a fall. It's hard to tell what date
[3:39:48.280 --> 3:39:52.280]  they're going to pick. It could be in three months. It could be in a year and a half.
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:56.280]  You know they have their own schedule. They're meeting scheming
[3:39:56.280 --> 3:40:00.280]  to engineer an even bigger implosion as they've admitted in the past to then pose
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:04.280]  as the saviors saying give us even more power or we'll have martial law.
[3:40:04.280 --> 3:40:08.280]  You know that they have martial law. I don't know who's going to do it because
[3:40:08.280 --> 3:40:12.280]  the lower and the middle echelons of the military all know
[3:40:12.280 --> 3:40:16.280]  what's going on. Bob I don't know though. I know a lot of them are awake. Evidence
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:20.280]  by Ron Paul getting more contributions than any other political candidate in 2008
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:24.280]  but these cops and military seem to enjoy beating the hell out of
[3:40:24.280 --> 3:40:28.280]  women especially for no reason and L ratting small children.
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:32.280]  I mean it seems like they want to destroy their country.
[3:40:32.280 --> 3:40:36.280]  Well I'm sure there's always some who will and perhaps they were chosen
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:40.280]  to do the work that they're doing because of their viciousness.
[3:40:40.280 --> 3:40:44.280]  I don't know. I know that the average military person
[3:40:44.280 --> 3:40:48.280]  does not want to go around beating people up particularly women
[3:40:48.280 --> 3:40:52.280]  and doing things which are unlawful
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:56.280]  and I think we're going to get a lot of support from the military
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:41:00.280]  and I think this may end up as a military coup.
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:04.280]  Well Bob let's
[3:41:04.280 --> 3:41:08.280]  and then I'm going to play this children worshiping Obama clip. I played it a month ago but again now it's national news
[3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:12.280]  people are emailing saying why aren't you covering it up because we broke it.
[3:41:12.280 --> 3:41:16.280]  We haven't you covered my act. We broke it. Not bragging it's just that
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:20.280]  that's an example of how this radio show pretty much more than any other outlet now
[3:41:20.280 --> 3:41:24.280]  but a lot of other great folks as well is now driving the news.
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:28.280]  What we break and cover weeks later months later is then covered by the mainstream media
[3:41:28.280 --> 3:41:32.280]  that shows the power of this audience.
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:36.280]  It certainly does and it is a powerful
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:40.280]  audience and it's up to them to keep on doing what they're doing
[3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:44.280]  and getting to everybody in America and informing them who the
[3:41:44.280 --> 3:41:48.280]  enemy of all the people is not some political party.
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:52.280]  We have to all come together and that's in every country
[3:41:52.280 --> 3:41:56.280]  because everybody is experiencing the same thing in countries throughout the world
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:00.280]  and so we got to make this thing stick and the more people
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:04.280]  who know who the enemy is the least chance that they
[3:42:04.280 --> 3:42:08.280]  have of being successful. Believe me I do not believe
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:12.280]  that the military are going to work against the American people.
[3:42:12.280 --> 3:42:16.280]  But we saw these two staged terror stings where the FBI
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:20.280]  cooked the bomb, the fake bombs in both cases and found one
[3:42:20.280 --> 3:42:24.280]  lone nut idiot. It's probably informants. They're probably setting them up. We know they've done that in the past
[3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:28.280]  or it could just be a mental patient. In the case of 93 World Trade Center where the FBI
[3:42:28.280 --> 3:42:32.280]  cooked in the bomb, traded the drivers and ordering their informants to stand down and let it happen.
[3:42:32.280 --> 3:42:36.280]  I think of these staged terror attacks and things though it might help.
[3:42:36.280 --> 3:42:40.280]  Well you're always going to find people who are
[3:42:40.280 --> 3:42:44.280]  pliable for that. I mean when they did the tests and the
[3:42:44.280 --> 3:42:48.280]  surveys some 20 years ago
[3:42:48.280 --> 3:42:52.280]  they found that there were 10 to 15 percent
[3:42:52.280 --> 3:42:56.280]  of the military who would do heinous things.
[3:42:56.280 --> 3:43:00.280]  And you're always going to find just like we have criminals in society.
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:04.280]  Or if you have 15 hired anarchists run up and throw some bottles
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:08.280]  at the cops then the cops will go ahead and open up with rubber bullets.
[3:43:08.280 --> 3:43:12.280]  Well I have a question about that Alex and the question is
[3:43:12.280 --> 3:43:16.280]  do you believe that the anarchists, the supposed anarchists
[3:43:16.280 --> 3:43:20.280]  are being trained and put into the positions they are
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:24.280]  by the people who control our government? Here's the answer.
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:28.280]  In hindsight in every case it's been proven
[3:43:28.280 --> 3:43:32.280]  mainstream Toronto Star, National Post, Denver Post,
[3:43:32.280 --> 3:43:36.280]  Seattle Times, Genoa, England G20
[3:43:36.280 --> 3:43:40.280]  this year, killing the paper delivery guy. In every case
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:44.280]  it's come out confirmed the police, the FBI
[3:43:44.280 --> 3:43:48.280]  or hired foundation people are doing it.
[3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:52.280]  So we don't know yet. We rarely catch them
[3:43:52.280 --> 3:43:56.280]  right at the time but it always comes out later. In Canada people followed
[3:43:56.280 --> 3:44:00.280]  the police car and saw them let them out a block away and were taking their outfits off
[3:44:00.280 --> 3:44:04.280]  and they had police boots on and the royal amount of police had to admit it. But yes, I've watched the video
[3:44:04.280 --> 3:44:08.280]  and you'll have a bunch of idiot meth head kids who are with them
[3:44:08.280 --> 3:44:12.280]  maybe 110 to 1% of the total crowd, a few morons because the feds go and
[3:44:12.280 --> 3:44:16.280]  recruit patsies but you see it. These are cops and informants and
[3:44:16.280 --> 3:44:20.280]  state police officers that are doing this and their argument is we neutralize
[3:44:20.280 --> 3:44:24.280]  a dangerous crowd by creating the pretext. It's kind of like you put out
[3:44:24.280 --> 3:44:28.280]  an oil well fire with a stick of dynamite. They say well we're knocking this out. These protests
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:32.280]  are dangerous. The terror threat is real. Men, we got to go out and stage an event
[3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:36.280]  to keep everybody safe and that's what they do.
[3:44:36.280 --> 3:44:40.280]  And there are those elements that will always do that.
[3:44:40.280 --> 3:44:44.280]  We have elements in society that will always do those
[3:44:44.280 --> 3:44:48.280]  kind of things and so we have to expect it.
[3:44:48.280 --> 3:44:52.280]  I've listened to you talk about this before but I wanted
[3:44:52.280 --> 3:44:56.280]  to bring that fact out to put it in people's minds up front if you hadn't
[3:44:56.280 --> 3:45:00.280]  mentioned it earlier and I don't know whether you had. The point is we got to know
[3:45:00.280 --> 3:45:04.280]  the public has got to know that this anarchist reaction
[3:45:04.280 --> 3:45:08.280]  that you see all over the media right now, they're not calling him terror
[3:45:08.280 --> 3:45:12.280]  anymore. They're anarchists. It's all planned that way.
[3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:16.280]  It's all propaganda.
[3:45:16.280 --> 3:45:20.280]  The police heard everybody to a certain spot then the anarchists come out
[3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:24.280]  then, turn over a trash can, throw a rock
[3:45:24.280 --> 3:45:28.280]  and then the anarchists always pull back. The police wait.
[3:45:28.280 --> 3:45:32.280]  They'll even see anarchists and we've caught this on tape. They'll do a hand signal
[3:45:32.280 --> 3:45:36.280]  and then they move back and the cops open fire.
[3:45:36.280 --> 3:45:40.280]  That's right. So we want the public to know that this is all planned.
[3:45:40.280 --> 3:45:44.280]  It's planned by the power behind our government.
[3:45:44.280 --> 3:45:48.280]  Well they want to delegitimize all these tens of thousands of peaceful people. They do it with a handful
[3:45:48.280 --> 3:45:52.280]  of scum and it's just
[3:45:52.280 --> 3:45:56.280]  what would the police and the corrupt system do without the anarchist thugs? They would have to attack
[3:45:56.280 --> 3:46:00.280]  people that had done nothing and then Hitler staged an attack on his own
[3:46:00.280 --> 3:46:04.280]  base to attack Poland. Operation Northwood is the same deal.
[3:46:04.280 --> 3:46:08.280]  Operation Gliwitz. Operation Ajax. It's declassified. I want to play this
[3:46:08.280 --> 3:46:12.280]  worship piece of Obama. Then I want to come back and get into a little bit on the economy
[3:46:12.280 --> 3:46:16.280]  what you see happening in the next few months of the year with the G20
[3:46:16.280 --> 3:46:20.280]  and why they're announcing their world government. But here is one of many videos
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:24.280]  the kids are wearing uniforms in some videos chanting city year in military
[3:46:24.280 --> 3:46:28.280]  outfits, red and black uniforms, climate cops, Boy Scouts trained
[3:46:28.280 --> 3:46:32.280]  to spy on their parents and to quote take on disgruntled veterans, New York Times
[3:46:32.280 --> 3:46:36.280]  it's all happening. But here are the children literally
[3:46:36.280 --> 3:46:40.280]  worshipping Obama like we're North Korea.
[3:46:40.280 --> 3:46:50.280]  Barack Obama. He said it all on his second hand to make this country strong again.
[3:46:50.280 --> 3:46:55.280]  Barack Obama. He said it all must be fair today.
[3:46:55.280 --> 3:46:59.280]  Eagle work means eagle attack.
[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:04.280]  Barack Obama. He said it all on his second hand
[3:47:04.280 --> 3:47:09.280]  to make sure everyone gets a chance.
[3:47:09.280 --> 3:47:17.280]  Barack Obama. He said it all on his second hand to make sure everyone gets a chance.
[3:47:17.280 --> 3:47:26.280]  Barack Obama. He said it all on his second hand to make sure everyone gets a chance.
[3:47:26.280 --> 3:47:31.280]  Did you hear that applause? Did you hear that quote from Jesus loves all the little
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:35.280]  children? Then they do battle him or the Republic. But then and now it's Obama
[3:47:35.280 --> 3:47:39.280]  comes marching on. See when Obama said he wants to start speaking to the kids and
[3:47:39.280 --> 3:47:44.280]  on telescreens, on big TV screens, the original curriculum said to teach them to
[3:47:44.280 --> 3:47:48.280]  serve him and work with him. Then he backed off and said it'll just be an anti-drug
[3:47:48.280 --> 3:47:52.280]  speech. This is the Sovietization of America, Bob Chapman.
[3:47:52.280 --> 3:47:59.280]  Absolutely. It's mind boggling and it's mind washing.
[3:47:59.280 --> 3:48:01.280]  What do we do about this?
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:07.280]  These zombies. All we can do is expose it. Congress won't do anything.
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:14.280]  The Senate won't do anything. We'll have to do the best we can until the die is cast.
[3:48:14.280 --> 3:48:18.280]  When that happens, the whole thing is going to blow sky high.
[3:48:18.280 --> 3:48:22.280]  It won't be only being America. It's going to happen all over the world.
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:27.280]  This is classical tyranny. They're hitting on all cylinders, secret police, militarized
[3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:32.280]  police, saying you can't march or demonstrate, attacking people, provocateurs, open world
[3:48:32.280 --> 3:48:35.280]  government, foreign banks looting us.
[3:48:35.280 --> 3:48:40.280]  Bob Chapman, I mean, they're openly 8,000 plus articles today in Google News.
[3:48:40.280 --> 3:48:45.280]  Today, 8,000 newspapers are reporting world government is here and how wonderful it is
[3:48:45.280 --> 3:48:49.280]  and that Obama is now president of the planet.
[3:48:49.280 --> 3:48:54.280]  And that will continue because they own the media and we're fighting them from the
[3:48:54.280 --> 3:48:58.280]  other side and it's not going to stop.
[3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:00.280]  Briefly, Bob, we're going to...
[3:49:00.280 --> 3:49:02.280]  And you know, it's just like with the financial thing.
[3:49:02.280 --> 3:49:05.280]  We don't know when they're going to pull the plug, but they're going to pull it.
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:13.280]  We also know that they're going to use biological warfare to, what would I call it,
[3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:18.280]  pacify the people so they won't run and get the gun to defend themselves,
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:23.280]  that they'll just sit around and wait for somebody to collect them because they're ill.
[3:49:23.280 --> 3:49:27.280]  That's right, it's a perfect soft kill operation to make everybody stand down.
[3:49:27.280 --> 3:49:30.280]  But the police and military that don't know what the new order means for them,
[3:49:30.280 --> 3:49:36.280]  they are always the most preyed upon group once the takeover has happened.
[3:49:36.280 --> 3:49:42.280]  Well, just to go back to what Henry Kissinger said, generally paraphrasing him,
[3:49:42.280 --> 3:49:47.280]  they're dumb animals, you know, they're cannon fodder.
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:51.280]  Yeah, he said military men are dumb animals and published it.
[3:49:51.280 --> 3:49:55.280]  Well, it just shows you the disdain and arrogance that they have.
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:50:00.280]  You know, let me tell you something, no matter what happens to people,
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:02.280]  they're not going to make it.
[3:50:02.280 --> 3:50:05.280]  The people who are behind the scenes who are causing this.
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:09.280]  It's just that we're going to pay a terrible price as humanity
[3:50:09.280 --> 3:50:12.280]  because we wouldn't listen, generally speaking.
[3:50:12.280 --> 3:50:15.280]  And they're going to lose.
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:21.280]  Because people will, there are certain people and all we need is five to ten percent of the population
[3:50:21.280 --> 3:50:24.280]  who refuse to live in their knees.
[3:50:24.280 --> 3:50:26.280]  We're going to go out with a battle.
[3:50:26.280 --> 3:50:30.280]  Him and the Republic with the children worshiping Obama with his name in place of the Republic.
[3:50:30.280 --> 3:50:33.280]  We'll come back with Bob Chapman on the economy.
[3:50:33.280 --> 3:51:02.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:51:02.280 --> 3:51:08.280]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[3:51:08.280 --> 3:51:13.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[3:51:13.280 --> 3:51:17.280]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country,
[3:51:17.280 --> 3:51:19.280]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[3:51:19.280 --> 3:51:24.280]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[3:51:24.280 --> 3:51:31.280]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[3:51:31.280 --> 3:51:35.280]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[3:51:35.280 --> 3:51:39.280]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[3:51:39.280 --> 3:51:42.280]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[3:51:42.280 --> 3:51:49.280]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[3:51:49.280 --> 3:51:53.280]  That's 877-327-0365.
[3:51:53.280 --> 3:51:58.280]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[3:51:58.280 --> 3:52:01.280]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:52:01.280 --> 3:52:07.280]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.280 --> 3:52:15.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[3:52:15.280 --> 3:52:22.280]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:22.280 --> 3:52:26.280]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:26.280 --> 3:52:30.280]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:52:30.280 --> 3:52:37.280]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:37.280 --> 3:52:41.280]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.280 --> 3:52:48.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.280 --> 3:52:56.280]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super-high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:56.280 --> 3:53:22.280]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:53:27.280 --> 3:53:33.280]  On lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[3:53:33.280 --> 3:53:41.280]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen. It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[3:53:41.280 --> 3:54:01.280]  If the video never lies, watch Big Brother Back. Visit diginet.net or call 1-888-344-6681.
[3:54:01.280 --> 3:54:30.280]  The G20 world government being announced on Live Sunday, 4-6pm.
[3:54:30.280 --> 3:54:33.280]  Please tell your friends, your family, your neighbors about the show.
[3:54:33.280 --> 3:54:40.280]  Even if they don't have an AM or FM station in their area, or satellite, or shortwave WWCR, they can listen at infowars.com.
[3:54:40.280 --> 3:54:46.280]  And even if you don't listen online, friends and family do, tell them about the free podcast at the listen link at infowars.com.
[3:54:46.280 --> 3:54:54.280]  In the next hour, it will be up for sale. You can be the first people to order what's coming out October 21st, so we'll ship it to you first.
[3:54:54.280 --> 3:55:03.280]  That is Fall of the Republic. You can read the description of the film. It's all going up in the online shopping cart at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:11.280]  The next hour, we'll have links over to the shopping cart as well from the website with the trailer up there, falloftherepublic.com.
[3:55:11.280 --> 3:55:15.280]  That's falloftherepublic.com.
[3:55:15.280 --> 3:55:18.280]  Bob Chapman, in closing, the economy.
[3:55:18.280 --> 3:55:25.280]  Things aren't going well. They're starting to drop. They're takeover of healthcare. A lot of their entire agenda is stalling.
[3:55:25.280 --> 3:55:31.280]  Do you think they're going to stage terror attacks? What is the establishment going to do? And what do you see happening in the economy?
[3:55:31.280 --> 3:55:44.280]  Well, they have the problems, as you just mentioned, cap and trade as well, which they're pushing very hard now with the President's speech, as well as Clinton getting up there and running around in his hind legs.
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:55.280]  And next, we've got the turmoil that's going to occur during the month of October from the swine flu situation. I hope you got my email.
[3:55:55.280 --> 3:56:05.280]  And also, we're going to have the dollar down at around $71.18 in the USDX. It's currently around $77.
[3:56:05.280 --> 3:56:21.280]  And what's going to happen is that they're going to tell you, and they are in the process of doing so, that they're going to start removing all of this money and credit that they have injected into the system.
[3:56:21.280 --> 3:56:30.280]  And that cannot happen without the entire economy collapsing. And so I don't think they're ready yet to go for it.
[3:56:30.280 --> 3:56:35.280]  It's going to happen in probably in the next year and a half. I don't know when, but I don't think they're ready.
[3:56:35.280 --> 3:56:44.280]  So it's kind of like the hesitation at the edge of a 200-foot cliff about to jump into the water. They're kind of hesitating, getting everybody ready, sending up trial balloons.
[3:56:44.280 --> 3:56:49.280]  Tell people what it will look like if the dollar is dumped.
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:57:07.280]  There will be an official devaluation, probably one new one for three old ones. There will be a default on debt that will be coordinated entirely by a meeting such as the Smithsonian, and then later in the 80s, the Plaza Records.
[3:57:07.280 --> 3:57:18.280]  And they will revalue and devalue all currencies against one another, and they will probably chop off two-thirds of the debt, and the debtors will pay back one-third.
[3:57:18.280 --> 3:57:33.280]  How that will affect individuals within individual economies, I don't know. I know what the logical thing to do is, but goodness knows they may not use the logical thing, which is to reduce debt by the same amount domestically.
[3:57:33.280 --> 3:57:43.280]  And that's what we've got coming as far as money and credit is concerned. How do you protect yourself? You've got to be in gold. It's the only place, gold and silver.
[3:57:43.280 --> 3:57:51.280]  But what you said is key for laymen that don't understand. Institutions and big globalist groups are going to have their debt forgiven and a devaluation of currency.
[3:57:51.280 --> 3:58:01.280]  But they're probably going to keep all the maximum debts on us, keep increasing taxes, and just billy club it out of us like the sheriff of Nottingham in the days of Robin Hood.
[3:58:01.280 --> 3:58:05.280]  Absolutely. That's probably the way they'll go.
[3:58:05.280 --> 3:58:16.280]  And the people are in for it, and the police are being brainwashed like attack dogs against us right now at theinternationalforecaster.com. We'll link to this big breaking news at prisonplanet.com on the flu that Bob was just telling you about.
[3:58:16.280 --> 3:58:19.280]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:58:19.280 --> 3:58:23.280]  Thank you for having me, and thank everybody for listening.
[3:58:23.280 --> 3:58:28.280]  You bet. You can go to theinternationalforecaster.com and get a free copy of this newsletter. It's excellent.
[3:58:28.280 --> 3:58:35.280]  Please go pre-order Fall of the Republic. It's going up in the next hour at infowars.com. Fall of the Republic.com. See you back live this Sunday.
[3:58:35.280 --> 3:58:41.280]  Retransmission with Dave Mustaine and a lot more coming up right now at infowars.com. Great job, crew.
[3:58:41.280 --> 3:58:50.280]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:50.280 --> 3:58:54.280]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[3:58:54.280 --> 3:59:02.280]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[3:59:02.280 --> 3:59:07.280]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:59:07.280 --> 3:59:13.280]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[3:59:13.280 --> 3:59:21.280]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:59:21.280 --> 3:59:28.280]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[3:59:28.280 --> 3:59:38.280]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[3:59:38.280 --> 3:59:51.280]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
