[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  It's Friday, November 19th, the year is 2021, and I think
[00:29.960 --> 00:38.480]  it's very important just to sit back and let it sink in very slowly the
[00:38.480 --> 00:44.240]  incredible news the US government and the British government are both
[00:44.240 --> 00:50.120]  announcing that they are going to announce mandatory booster shots for
[00:50.120 --> 00:54.360]  federal employees the military and companies over a hundred people the
[00:54.360 --> 00:59.760]  puppet president and the press secretary of the puppet have said
[00:59.760 --> 01:04.960]  ignore the federal court the mandate goes ahead quote business as usual I
[01:04.960 --> 01:11.560]  have the video that it's just insane and the letter went out last night I've
[01:11.560 --> 01:17.000]  got the article right here in the actual letter where everybody's gonna
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.640]  basically be reprimanded and kicked out of the military it's just short of a
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.160]  dishonorable discharge but you'll have a bad record if you don't take the shot
[01:25.160 --> 01:28.760]  and they're saying it may be 10 shots it may be 20 shots you're just gonna take
[01:28.760 --> 01:33.360]  in your body what we want when we want and you add that to the documents even
[01:33.360 --> 01:36.880]  coming out in the Washington Post well they're very proud of it they're like
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.280]  yeah Pfizer has secret agreements and runs the media runs the government and
[01:40.280 --> 01:44.480]  can even override Congress and the Senate the president well you can't sign
[01:44.480 --> 01:49.720]  stuff like that I mean even sure okay Trump did that you know they they put
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.920]  warp speed in front of me didn't really know what the thousands of pages of
[01:52.920 --> 01:58.320]  secret agreements are but we got to just move past that and admit Trump screwed
[01:58.320 --> 02:04.160]  the pooch and we got to stop this and that's how Trump can salvage himself we
[02:04.160 --> 02:07.800]  need Trump he's a good guy overall we need him to get good patriots elected
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.240]  but look at this one in Virginia but train conservatives coming out saying
[02:12.240 --> 02:17.040]  you'll let them push force inoculations and lockdowns and masks in the blue
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.520]  cities which is all the major cities of the great state of Virginia so more of
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.760]  the same it's just a nightmare scenario but look at these headlines
[02:26.760 --> 02:33.600]  official public health England says COVID infection rates higher in vax than
[02:33.600 --> 02:37.200]  unvaxxed and there's higher hospitalizations and higher death rates
[02:37.200 --> 02:40.920]  and it's got all the graphs and all the numbers linked directly to them on
[02:40.920 --> 02:48.640]  info wars.com and big articles laying it out again detailing it and then here
[02:48.640 --> 02:54.120]  it is ladies and gentlemen Austria makes COVID vaccine mandatory vows penalties
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.720]  for those who resist thousands arrested for going outside without
[02:57.720 --> 03:02.880]  authorization here's one here in the United States and be seen as hospitalizations
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.520]  rising among fully vaccinated in the U.S. Fauci says yeah so you're not less
[03:07.520 --> 03:10.720]  likely to get sick and less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to die
[03:10.720 --> 03:14.560]  you're more likely to die remember when he said oh it doesn't actually stop
[03:14.560 --> 03:20.200]  transmission and it doesn't stop you getting it but you won't die as much
[03:20.200 --> 03:27.080]  just made up pulled out of his his rear end which is his mouth and then we had
[03:27.080 --> 03:32.200]  the real numbers we told you this and we told you 20 months ago 21 months ago
[03:32.200 --> 03:37.400]  that they would do this because it was already scripted it was baked in Pfizer
[03:37.400 --> 03:41.160]  told its shareholders two years ago before this even happened that they're
[03:41.160 --> 03:45.320]  gonna have new vaccines for emerging viruses that'll be gene therapies that
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.920]  you've got to take multiple times a year Austria back into lockdown anger
[03:51.920 --> 03:55.760]  builds who's next well they said if I never got to it yesterday in fact guys
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.040]  make sure I have that in my list Ireland said get ready for more lockdowns and
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.360]  Germany more lockdowns and France more lockdowns in the UK more lockdowns so
[04:04.360 --> 04:10.920]  get this the boosters lower your immunity even faster and give you no
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.800]  protection in the major Israeli studies in fact they lower your immunity and
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.240]  make you get sicker that came out six months ago and of course scientists we
[04:19.240 --> 04:21.880]  had on before they even started the injections said this would happen because
[04:21.880 --> 04:25.680]  it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy and one that actually erases your immune
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.440]  system I mean this is not a good one they've got the gene therapies that are
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.600]  patented to cure cancer but it's unbelievable but the public's not getting
[04:34.600 --> 04:38.160]  that you can be sure to that you're gonna get the poison death shot so it
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.160]  doesn't work it makes you sicker so the answers more shots and Biden's getting
[04:42.160 --> 04:46.600]  ready to announce third round and England's already saying you're gonna
[04:46.600 --> 04:49.640]  have your booster or you won't be able to leave your house vaccine passport

[06:53.560 --> 06:59.760]  army stand up to government's health dictatorship mandates will join massive
[06:59.760 --> 07:05.280]  anti-government freedom scheduled for Saturday and we're gonna be covering this
[07:05.280 --> 07:08.960]  article extensively and talking about victory at the bottom of the hour and I'm
[07:08.960 --> 07:13.760]  gonna post I'm sure Jim Hoff will let me do it this article so important I'm gonna
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.400]  post this article info wars.com the link to them but we need solidarity and I'm
[07:18.400 --> 07:23.240]  just asking my writers and my crew and and all the listeners to promote to
[07:23.240 --> 07:27.120]  promote worldwide solidarity against this and standing up and then if the
[07:27.120 --> 07:32.480]  soldiers ever shoot at the people well it's that fever vendetta moment for real
[07:32.480 --> 07:37.960]  and it's gonna be a chelchescu moment for these puppets these dictators they're
[07:37.960 --> 07:41.400]  gonna be strung up in the town square or they're gonna be killed in firing
[07:41.400 --> 07:45.280]  squads and I'm not calling for that and I don't want to go down that road but
[07:45.280 --> 07:48.520]  that's where this is going
[07:51.880 --> 07:55.800]  here's the problem I've already wargamed this and they knew the police
[07:55.800 --> 08:02.040]  military would start waking up as soon as they start to wake up and take action
[08:02.040 --> 08:07.040]  the globalists are gonna release a super bio weapon they may even use which we
[08:07.040 --> 08:10.760]  know in studies they have 5g that can push the oxygen out of your lungs and
[08:10.760 --> 08:14.440]  make you think you're dying of a pneumonia like illness as well your body has an
[08:14.440 --> 08:19.200]  autoimmune response to it you know they've been testing that and so they're
[08:19.200 --> 08:23.720]  gonna roll out their next attack when this happens and then and then again say
[08:23.720 --> 08:29.000]  see you better do what we say or we're not gonna give you the cure and then
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.240]  there they will have a cure actually for that real weapon that they'll give the
[08:33.240 --> 08:37.160]  military and police to go along with them and then they'll have them hostage
[08:37.160 --> 08:40.720]  the military police will even know it's the globalists releasing it it won't be
[08:40.720 --> 08:43.480]  official but they'll just understand that hey you and your families will have
[08:43.480 --> 08:51.400]  this give you join us and then they'll be prisoners basically slave soldiers so
[08:51.400 --> 08:58.520]  I've look I've worked in every possible outcome here and if the police and
[08:58.520 --> 09:03.000]  military when they do this go under the control then they're just gonna slowly
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.680]  kill them as well later the only chance we have is when they try this to be
[09:06.680 --> 09:10.320]  fully aware of it and have enough people that understand that there's no
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.680]  making a deal with these people I mean I've committed myself into God's hands
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.560]  and I know every day is a blessing and I'm very blessed to be here very blessed
[09:21.560 --> 09:25.920]  have known this crew very blessed to have known my parents and my family it's
[09:25.920 --> 09:28.600]  just been a great honor and I'm not saying they're gonna kill me tomorrow
[09:28.600 --> 09:31.840]  next week I will never commit suicide it's just that these are the times where
[09:31.840 --> 09:36.680]  you better better enjoy every moment you got because we are in an absolute
[09:36.680 --> 09:41.840]  undeclared war against humanity right now I mean this is biblical 100 percent
[09:41.840 --> 09:51.160]  Satan so I'm gonna get to it at the bottom of the hour it is so amazing to
[09:51.160 --> 09:56.880]  actually be in this day and time and so I have all these amazing interesting
[09:56.880 --> 10:00.760]  articles that are very important and very informative and call written house
[10:00.760 --> 10:05.960]  news and Congressman goes there news and all of its very interesting and Joe
[10:05.960 --> 10:09.320]  Biden's gonna get a colonoscopy for a couple hours will be under so Kamala
[10:09.320 --> 10:13.800]  will be the president they all fetishize that oh the first black woman is
[10:13.800 --> 10:20.560]  president which is not even black and neither one of them are running anything
[10:20.560 --> 10:31.040]  they didn't get elected none of that matters what matters is I have the
[10:31.040 --> 10:34.560]  British Health Ministry admitting that you are more likely to die be
[10:34.560 --> 10:39.280]  hospitalized or become ill if you have the frickin COVID shot and we know from
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.560]  the Israeli studies and others that those that take the third round are
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.120]  hundreds of times more likely to die than if you only had one shot or two
[10:49.120 --> 10:56.040]  shots I mean this is just devastating and it's happening and then what's the
[10:56.040 --> 11:00.520]  response the British government and the US government oh get ready for mandatory
[11:00.520 --> 11:07.840]  third shots you're gonna have a vaccine passport on your phone to do this and
[11:07.840 --> 11:11.080]  you ask why would they do something so bold so crazy so insane well they've
[11:11.080 --> 11:17.000]  already gotten away with in places like Germany kidnapping millions of children
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.760]  over the last 40 years and creating a giant system of pedophile networks
[11:21.760 --> 11:28.400]  millions of children millions tens of thousands per year per town over really
[11:28.400 --> 11:34.240]  over 40 years 30 plus thousand in one middle-sized German city alone taken
[11:34.240 --> 11:43.520]  from their parents and given to people to rape them under a inner pole NATO
[11:43.520 --> 11:47.360]  mind control operation by the way if you're a new listener this is all
[11:47.360 --> 11:53.720]  mainstream this psychiatrist and psychologist taking children from over
[11:53.720 --> 12:00.920]  a million families and placing them to create a new society where those
[12:00.920 --> 12:06.040]  children now believe having sex with a man mainly boys is normal and is their
[12:06.040 --> 12:10.360]  life to then go out and then they do the same thing on a wider scale they become
[12:10.360 --> 12:15.680]  police officers they become judges they become CPS workers they and then they go
[12:15.680 --> 12:21.200]  out and it's not like you grow up and come of age and go on your first date
[12:21.200 --> 12:24.320]  when you're 14 or whatever and hold your hand at the movie theater and mom and
[12:24.320 --> 12:30.080]  dad pick you up and you know it's it's a cute date you're on and you bring your
[12:30.080 --> 12:36.200]  chocolates on Valentine's Day hell maybe you get married when you're 16 17 and
[12:36.200 --> 12:43.640]  you know start early whatever that's all demonized and horrible but little
[12:43.640 --> 12:49.640]  children by them over a million hundreds of thousands per state over the
[12:49.640 --> 12:55.080]  decades taken to create the new culture and when you see the men's choir in
[12:55.080 --> 12:58.440]  San Francisco and a bunch of them are convicted child rapist and they're
[12:58.440 --> 13:01.880]  licking their lip saying we're coming for your children this is our family this
[13:01.880 --> 13:07.160]  is our love you will join us you will love it they they they are proud of it
[13:07.160 --> 13:15.680]  they were raped as children and that's how you create a new society based on it
[13:15.680 --> 13:18.000]  that's how they took over the Vatican it's how they take over the universities
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.040]  how they took over the Boy Scouts that's what this is and that's what the video
[13:23.040 --> 13:26.680]  is starts with two guys four guys six guys and at the end it's a hundred and
[13:26.680 --> 13:29.880]  they say we're taking them we're recruiting them we're grooming them
[13:29.880 --> 13:36.600]  that's the new love your children will go on grinder they will have sex with us
[13:37.440 --> 13:45.120]  this was defended by newspapers across the country as a good video it's because
[13:45.120 --> 13:53.360]  it's run by the people that run the CIA this is a government level operation to
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.360]  in civilization as we know it and have a get them off screen please thank you a
[13:57.360 --> 14:06.280]  literal army of pedophiles an army the pedophile armies a hundred million

[14:12.840 --> 14:18.000]  that will do anything they have to have access to your children and then all
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.120]  their minions and supporters like these guys up here that think it's all
[14:21.120 --> 14:27.560]  cutesy and I bet you all the tea in China I bet you every dollar I got in the
[14:27.560 --> 14:33.840]  bank I bet you my right arm that 90% of the men on that screen were abused as
[14:33.840 --> 14:39.200]  children and you know it true and they all have the same weird affectations and
[14:39.200 --> 14:45.000]  all the weird same mannerisms because it's a cult it's a spirit it's a
[14:45.000 --> 14:54.040]  program and that smiley face of those little piggy eyes is just a cover that's
[14:54.040 --> 15:03.640]  just the veneer of it the clown when it whites that smile off those children
[15:03.640 --> 15:08.800]  cry out to God and who comes to save them in God's name who stands up for

[17:48.080 --> 17:52.600]  wars store.com but right now we've got turbo force sold out for months ten
[17:52.600 --> 17:57.920]  hours of energy back and stop the free shipping 40% off and so many other great
[17:57.920 --> 18:05.480]  products. The globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[18:05.480 --> 18:10.080]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're
[18:10.080 --> 18:13.720]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the
[18:13.720 --> 18:19.960]  creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so
[18:19.960 --> 18:23.600]  that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came
[18:23.600 --> 18:30.400]  up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.640]  situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lives and
[18:35.640 --> 18:42.200]  all their evil all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they
[18:42.200 --> 18:46.320]  know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser and that's
[18:46.320 --> 18:49.320]  why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than
[18:49.320 --> 18:53.600]  ever because even you don't believe in God but the globalist are manifesting
[18:53.600 --> 18:58.400]  setting up and we are opposing the one-world government and the mark of
[18:58.400 --> 19:02.200]  the beast they just announced I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost
[19:02.200 --> 19:07.680]  28 years against the globalist I wanted to stop their agenda I wanted to wake up
[19:07.680 --> 19:12.520]  the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but
[19:12.520 --> 19:16.720]  we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flat footed
[19:16.720 --> 19:21.800]  but they are going ahead with their full operational the industrialization
[19:21.800 --> 19:25.880]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and
[19:25.880 --> 19:29.920]  all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready
[19:29.920 --> 19:33.560]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare the
[19:33.560 --> 19:37.080]  enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared
[19:37.080 --> 19:40.240]  and one of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food you've got
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.440]  the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com
[19:44.440 --> 19:48.720]  so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets it's
[19:48.720 --> 19:53.600]  ready to ship right now lock your orders in before food prices go up and before
[19:53.600 --> 19:57.720]  there are long lines and waits because believe me serious times are coming get
[19:57.720 --> 20:01.000]  ready at infowarstore.com
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:23.600 --> 20:28.480]  so there's a civil war happening in our hearts and minds there's a civil war
[20:28.480 --> 20:32.640]  happening in our churches and our businesses in our farms in our ranches
[20:32.640 --> 20:36.840]  in our schools it's happening inside the Pentagon it's happening inside the
[20:36.840 --> 20:40.360]  military it's happening inside the intelligence agencies there are a lot of
[20:40.360 --> 20:44.920]  good men and women of every race color and creed that make up society but there's
[20:44.920 --> 20:53.200]  a lot of evil people right beside you and you can't underestimate how many
[20:53.200 --> 20:56.120]  actual evil people there are I used to underestimate it that there's still a
[20:56.120 --> 20:59.960]  minority but it's it's a growing minority because evil is recruiting and
[20:59.960 --> 21:05.360]  training and and and twisting people there are also a lot of really good
[21:05.360 --> 21:09.040]  people that have not been awake and have just been in a trance and there's a
[21:09.040 --> 21:13.600]  lot more good people than there are bad people and our job is to mobilize those
[21:13.600 --> 21:17.600]  individuals so I've got the most important news coming up next segment
[21:17.600 --> 21:21.760]  about the military and police saying no to this tyranny and how the globalists
[21:21.760 --> 21:25.000]  are going to try to stop that and block that and and why they want to get the
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.920]  digital society in place up front so that they will then be able to get
[21:29.920 --> 21:34.640]  civilization to do anything they want and and what their real in game is and
[21:34.640 --> 21:40.480]  then how the how the metaverse ties into that but let me say this it's very
[21:40.480 --> 21:47.520]  important when we're fighting this level of evil to not let it get us down and to
[21:47.520 --> 21:55.320]  not let it depress us and when I say that I'm telling myself that God's in
[21:55.320 --> 22:01.000]  control this is all a big test and we should be rejoicing that actual
[22:01.000 --> 22:06.600]  prophecy is being refee being totally revealed and is unfolding because that
[22:06.600 --> 22:12.880]  just certifies and proves we're on the right track that much more not to mention
[22:12.880 --> 22:19.440]  all the discernment and the spiritual experiences and just all the magic
[22:19.440 --> 22:23.680]  involved with the relationship with the creator of the universe so that
[22:23.680 --> 22:29.760]  relationship is everything and everything else flows from that and I just
[22:29.760 --> 22:34.520]  cannot describe to you ladies and gentlemen what it's like and I know a
[22:34.520 --> 22:40.120]  lot of you already have this experience when you engage and fight evil and truly
[22:40.120 --> 22:46.600]  get lined up with God how amazing the universe opening up is I mean the
[22:46.600 --> 22:50.800]  things happening in my life the things that are happening with my mind now are
[22:50.800 --> 22:58.080]  just unbelievable and I can understand why God is not give this type of power
[22:58.080 --> 23:02.440]  to evil people and I think that's why they hate those of us that love God
[23:02.440 --> 23:09.080]  because they've got a good idea and wow I've always had discernment but but now
[23:09.080 --> 23:16.160]  it's just super strong very powerful now and it's hard to deal with it's hard to
[23:16.160 --> 23:19.800]  look at each thing and have such knowledge about it that it it's just
[23:19.800 --> 23:28.800]  overwhelming and the only reason I tell you this is so you really think about
[23:28.800 --> 23:33.440]  how the magic of consciousness and God's gifts are just so incredible and one
[23:33.440 --> 23:41.320]  second of life like Dr. Zelenko says is is just a precious moment in time and
[23:41.320 --> 23:47.920]  is and is a universe in and of itself and I love Dr. Zelenko I love him and I
[23:47.920 --> 23:53.880]  love all of you and we just have to get the Christ consciousness I mean there's
[23:53.880 --> 23:57.640]  an old Jewish doctor telling you we need the Christ consciousness it's real folks
[23:57.640 --> 24:04.680]  God God consciousness and it's happening and you either take on the spirit or you
[24:04.680 --> 24:08.240]  take on the evil spirit I'm gonna say this here and then I'm gonna move all
[24:08.240 --> 24:14.360]  the big news I'm speaking from the heart here I tend to get so angry and so
[24:14.360 --> 24:18.400]  upset about this and and fatalistic we don't want the enemy tricking us into
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.360]  that we want to be very measured with what we do we do not want to be reckless
[24:23.360 --> 24:27.160]  believe me I'm pointing fingers back at myself I'm a reckless person sometimes
[24:27.160 --> 24:32.480]  very reckless and we need to just have the Holy Spirit direct us he'd got a
[24:32.480 --> 24:36.000]  direct us and we need to think long-term because even though things look
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.960]  really bad now things are out of control I can see us pushing back this wave
[24:39.960 --> 24:44.480]  except in a few sectors where they beta test their control grid cities that I'll
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.520]  cover next segment and then the wave of liberty is gonna push back for a while
[24:50.520 --> 24:54.720]  and so we have to keep thinking about building infrastructure and and in
[24:54.720 --> 25:00.200]  standing up and developing our own communities of thought and culture and
[25:00.200 --> 25:05.840]  a physical land and assets and that God wants us to inherit the earth and God
[25:05.840 --> 25:11.600]  wants us to go forth and be fruitful and and be successful and multiply and so
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.080]  in the face of them trying to shut us all down we need to become bigger
[25:15.080 --> 25:19.160]  stronger we need to push back against it and not use it as something that
[25:19.160 --> 25:24.560]  crushes us but something that is there to test us and empower us so I cannot
[25:24.560 --> 25:29.080]  stress to you enough how important it is that you support the broadcast
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.480]  obviously we're being railroaded by these political courts and all the things
[25:33.480 --> 25:39.360]  that are going on against us and we can hold on in our current operational
[25:39.360 --> 25:47.120]  phase for years while other incredible avenues are being opened up and
[25:47.120 --> 25:53.080]  prepared on so many fronts on so many fronts I'm talking about the chain
[25:53.080 --> 25:56.360]  reaction happening right now not about physically what I'm setting up we're
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.400]  doing that's a very small part of this I've already detonated our main weapon
[26:01.400 --> 26:06.560]  and it's all now it's having its effect and I've got more weapons culture
[26:06.560 --> 26:13.040]  weapons preparing to detonate and it's gonna be spectacular so I'm just
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.120]  telling you our most important work is coming but we've already blown a giant
[26:18.120 --> 26:21.840]  hole in the enemy we already won okay they already know it they're pissed they
[26:21.840 --> 26:26.320]  know they know this broadcast the guest all of us together was just a weapon a
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.400]  big long super sharp just knife right in their heart just feel that and they're
[26:31.400 --> 26:34.600]  bleeding out politically right now and they want to stab us and get at us and
[26:34.600 --> 26:39.880]  scrabble around and flop around we're not like you Satanist we're not worried
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.600]  about our bodies we're not worried about how we look we don't care what the news
[26:43.600 --> 26:47.760]  says about us we don't understand we care about taking you down you understand
[26:47.760 --> 26:55.360]  that good and I will with God's help take you down so I need financial support
[26:55.360 --> 27:00.720]  so that I can use the money we've got to run these operations and devastate the
[27:00.720 --> 27:05.240]  enemy further and just be clear-eyed and focused while I do this like a surgeon
[27:05.240 --> 27:10.200]  and I need to hold it bay their little operatives and their systems and
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.760]  everything so we need funds so I want you to go to save info wars calm to give

[27:42.400 --> 27:46.960]  presentations and fund more journalists and many others but it takes money and

[27:58.920 --> 28:05.680]  got which isn't that much to just pour it into this to make sure and then I need
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.480]  money to then hold off the wolves while I finish getting everything set up and
[28:11.480 --> 28:15.440]  prepared and we got we've never had this much knowledge we've never had this

[31:58.080 --> 32:06.560]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience a symbol of slavery a
[32:06.560 --> 32:11.040]  symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the
[32:11.040 --> 32:16.920]  global private corporations has put in place it is the symbol of the permanent
[32:16.920 --> 32:21.200]  emergency from which we will ever emerge it is the symbol that we are
[32:21.200 --> 32:26.560]  diseased that evil and bad must cover our disease criminal faces from the light
[32:26.560 --> 32:34.800]  of the sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to
[32:34.800 --> 32:41.080]  evil. Ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the Rubicon now the entire
[32:41.080 --> 32:45.360]  future destiny of humanity is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're
[32:45.360 --> 32:49.280]  coming out with implantable microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes.
[32:49.280 --> 32:53.600]  Things only get worse from here if we submit they only get better if we
[32:53.600 --> 33:01.480]  resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance non-compliance you're
[33:01.480 --> 33:05.840]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:05.840 --> 33:32.120]  oh baby I'm gonna teach you what love's all about tonight. Okay thank you so much
[33:32.120 --> 33:40.520]  for joining us what did I talk about yesterday what did I talk about start
[33:40.520 --> 33:49.480]  of the show I said the criminals that run NATO and the top of Interpol are the
[33:49.480 --> 33:54.040]  corporate body set up at the end of World War two for the Marshall Plan in
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.400]  Europe where they were able with occupied countries to set up whatever they
[33:59.400 --> 34:10.760]  wanted you know France was never let out of occupation until de Gaulle basically
[34:10.760 --> 34:20.800]  had a coup and kicked the NATO group out and that's in the history books and
[34:20.800 --> 34:27.440]  they actually also seized the NATO nuclear weapons that were being stored
[34:27.440 --> 34:32.840]  in France I mean people don't even know about this that the French had to have
[34:32.840 --> 34:36.640]  a coup to get their country back you don't don't think the Nazis came in
[34:36.640 --> 34:43.160]  and crossed over the Maginot line to start a World War two in 1940 and that
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.960]  all the generals just gave up for no reason they were VC or they were going
[34:48.960 --> 34:55.880]  to establish VC France down in the south of France and that's how Hitler three
[34:55.880 --> 35:02.480]  weeks after the Germans invaded France Hitler was serving and touring
[35:02.480 --> 35:10.480]  downtown Paris driving down the road and the majority of Parisians were hailing
[35:10.480 --> 35:16.640]  Hitler that's because Hitler was so popular at the time and the US news said
[35:16.640 --> 35:20.200]  he was a great guy and the British news said he was a great guy because he was
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.560]  set up to think he was allowed to do all this on a secret treaty with the
[35:23.560 --> 35:28.400]  British Empire that later came out you're like what does have to do with
[35:28.400 --> 35:34.840]  happening now well through the Marshall plan the takeover of Europe NATO in
[35:34.840 --> 35:38.800]  these groups private corporate charter was able to do whatever it wanted in
[35:38.800 --> 35:44.160]  places like Germany and you saw what it did run giant industrial level
[35:44.160 --> 35:56.240]  pedophile takeover to create a new culture and of pedophile armies yeah
[35:56.240 --> 36:00.760]  there's the king of England England hailing Hitler Edward VIII but that's
[36:00.760 --> 36:07.600]  for TV viewers so when you see all this and you hear NATO coming out with this
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.760]  statement it's on info wars.com from zero hedge.com January 6 riot an
[36:13.760 --> 36:21.440]  attack on NATO and of course you know NATO's got spy groups and units here
[36:21.440 --> 36:24.960]  you know NATO carried out to Oklahoma City bombing in 95 we didn't even know
[36:24.960 --> 36:36.160]  the names of the NATO officers. With dramatic and overly self-serious gusto
[36:36.160 --> 36:43.840]  Stoltenberg told Axios journalists swan I regard as an attack on the core
[36:43.840 --> 36:47.880]  democratic institutions of the United States and therefore also in the core
[36:47.880 --> 36:52.760]  values of NATO. You can watch the video the interview was recorded last week
[36:52.760 --> 36:56.720]  when NATO's headquarters in Brussels ironically according to the same time
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.520]  the Stildaski began the much belated acknowledged and widely exposed as the
[37:02.520 --> 37:08.160]  mainstream as a utterly groundless falsehood and hoax. I'm confident that
[37:08.160 --> 37:11.760]  our biggest ally will remain a strong democracy oh yeah it's a real democracy
[37:11.760 --> 37:15.680]  over there with all the rigged elections in Europe and Germany and all the
[37:15.680 --> 37:22.720]  martial law and lockdowns what a joke. So that's what's going on here ladies and
[37:22.720 --> 37:33.520]  gentlemen and it isn't like the United States in England one World War two
[37:33.520 --> 37:38.440]  globalist forces that had set Hitler up and were telling him that he was going
[37:38.440 --> 37:41.640]  to be the dominant new force they were going to put the king of England as the
[37:41.640 --> 37:44.520]  head of the European Union that's all official by the way and mainline
[37:44.520 --> 37:51.040]  documents that came out in the 70s. That group basically double-crossed America
[37:51.040 --> 37:56.080]  the the UK, Germany, France, everybody. It was all about a corporate group using
[37:56.080 --> 38:01.480]  Hitler to start a war so they'd have a pretext to bring in the NATO EU plan and
[38:01.480 --> 38:07.240]  they did it all. Just as they used the virus and the fear of the virus and the
[38:07.240 --> 38:11.680]  deadly vaccines to break down society for a great reset so they can build back
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.120]  better they did the same thing with Hitler. So those that don't know history
[38:16.120 --> 38:20.800]  are doomed to repeat it. I just gave you a very brief overly simple snapshot of
[38:20.800 --> 38:24.440]  things that went on but you can go look up anything I just told you and it's
[38:24.440 --> 38:28.120]  right there it's not even debated but you're not gonna get that type of
[38:28.120 --> 38:31.360]  information on the history channel or discovery channel or even PBS but it's
[38:31.360 --> 38:38.080]  in the mainline history. So what does that have to do with the European Union
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.040]  today and the tyranny and the and the martial law and the vaccine passports
[38:42.040 --> 38:46.800]  and all of it well it has everything to do with that so that we as a people and
[38:46.800 --> 38:50.720]  as a culture not to share in America but around the world understand exactly
[38:50.720 --> 38:56.960]  what we are up against. This is very simple. I told you a couple years ago
[38:56.960 --> 39:02.160]  before they even released the virus I said they're gonna use the virus the
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.080]  virus is a pretext and they're gonna call it a new Marshall plan first for
[39:06.080 --> 39:12.680]  Europe and then for the world and when they call for a new Marshall plan that's
[39:12.680 --> 39:15.640]  when you know they've launched their takeover and and of course a year ago
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.160]  they called for the new Marshall plan a global Marshall plan to save the world
[39:19.160 --> 39:25.120]  from COVID and that's just where they get $150 trillion of taxpayer money into
[39:25.120 --> 39:31.520]  a UN corporate world government system to establish a world ID and a currency
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.760]  control and a calorie control and an energy control that surveils by law
[39:36.760 --> 39:45.680]  every action you make to then establish high-tech neo feudalism on top of the
[39:45.680 --> 39:52.520]  plan over all the economies and nation-states and that's why you have a
[39:52.520 --> 40:00.920]  agreement with Pfizer and the United Nations to roll all this out and why
[40:00.920 --> 40:05.160]  the government's then secretly signed agreements giving Pfizer and Big Tech
[40:05.160 --> 40:09.680]  control over all media communications because we've been put into a permanent
[40:09.680 --> 40:20.720]  form of martial law or emergency now as the police and military learn that they
[40:20.720 --> 40:24.560]  got to take 10 15 20 shots a year and then it's slowly gonna kill them they're
[40:24.560 --> 40:28.640]  gonna quit or they're gonna be fired and then they'll be able to bring in their
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.680]  own people who by the way are not gonna be taking the shots just like we we
[40:32.680 --> 40:35.960]  learned a few months ago that FEMA doesn't make their employees take shots
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.360]  when the hospitals fire half their people and then quote FEMA has to take
[40:40.360 --> 40:45.400]  over the hospitals no no no they don't have to the hospital group makes you do
[40:45.400 --> 40:49.840]  it then the FEMA people come in then hundreds of billions of dollars of
[40:49.840 --> 40:54.440]  quote aid gets pumped into the hospital groups under the emergency and now you've
[40:54.440 --> 40:59.640]  got federalization of the society take over the medical system the most trusted
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.120]  group first then you have a purge of the military with a critical race theory
[41:03.120 --> 41:11.880]  you have a purge the military using the vaccine garbage and then you've got them
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.480]  you've only got people in that'll follow orders and do what you're told you run
[41:15.480 --> 41:19.120]  off the smart people and then you can go wink wink hey you don't have to do
[41:19.120 --> 41:25.240]  any of that just follow our orders in the future when we go out and deal with
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.920]  the problem folks and by the way this was all really just a drill to save the
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.800]  earth the carrying capacity of the planet has gone over what it can they
[41:33.800 --> 41:37.480]  lie and say that and we've got to reduce the population by the year 2030
[41:37.480 --> 41:43.480]  massively and so do you want to be part of the winning team the losing team and
[41:43.480 --> 41:50.280]  that's the that's the that's the deception that's the deal that is then
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.760]  offered at that point now if the military and police get two out of hand
[41:55.760 --> 41:58.640]  and start actually overthrowing these dictatorships that have been
[41:58.640 --> 42:04.640]  established then a real bio weapon and or electromagnetic weapons or chemical
[42:04.640 --> 42:12.000]  weapons or a cocktail of that will be deployed and and then you'll have
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.800]  really large numbers of people dying and then they the globalists with their
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.960]  actuaries and psychological warfare research believe that then people will
[42:19.960 --> 42:29.120]  kind of stop their revolution against this back off and you will then have to
[42:29.120 --> 42:33.360]  sign all these political agreements and things to actually be given the cure for
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.080]  the real weapons they're gonna release you see how that works and it'll be fine
[42:37.080 --> 42:39.720]  with the system because they know that people are awake won't trust the next
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.960]  round the next group of shots for the new disease and so we won't take it and
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.360]  we'll die and then their people that follow orders will take it they'll live
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.040]  at least a little bit longer and then they'll just do that in different
[42:51.040 --> 42:54.800]  permutations until they whittle us down to nobody and that's it they're gonna
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.600]  kill everybody that's how they're gonna do it for a fraction of the cost info

[47:06.520 --> 47:32.440]  where are the clowns send in the clowns just when I stopped opening doors finally
[47:32.440 --> 47:48.000]  let me get to the good news I just laid out one major plot line permutation of
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.340]  the globalist operations and what they've already pre-programmed the public
[47:53.340 --> 47:58.560]  for it comes from thousands of documents I've read in research just
[47:58.560 --> 48:09.760]  understanding their algorithm but this is a establishment elite war on humanity
[48:09.760 --> 48:16.080]  itself this is a depopulationist event and that's all on record that's what's
[48:16.080 --> 48:20.440]  so amazing about this it's on record that these shots erasure immune system
[48:20.440 --> 48:25.000]  it's on record they give you blood clots and cancer it's on record do they go in
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.520]  and turn off the DNA being able to replicate and cause errors I mean
[48:30.520 --> 48:40.240]  that's in mainline prestigious studies and I talked to a lot of top doctors and
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.120]  scientists on air that agree that's what's happening and basically all the
[48:44.120 --> 48:49.240]  rest of them that come on say or even other prominent ones that won't come on
[48:49.240 --> 48:52.880]  they say we're with you we know you're right we know it's a deep depopulation
[48:52.880 --> 48:55.680]  operation and they'll start giving you all this evidence that you even know
[48:55.680 --> 48:58.960]  about on top of the evidence you've got but you know we're just the public's not
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.440]  ready for it so we're having to fight in this way what I'm telling you is there
[49:02.440 --> 49:13.240]  isn't just a consensus this is going on this is known this is known and anybody
[49:13.240 --> 49:17.000]  that plays along with this I don't care if you're a colonel in the military I
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.120]  don't care if you're a senior FBI agent or a senior ATF agent or a senior
[49:21.120 --> 49:28.480]  federal marshal I don't care who you are you are destroying yourself being part
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.840]  of this and living in denial about it nobody is going to get out of this
[49:32.840 --> 49:36.840]  except a very small group if they're successful and by the way they're not
[49:36.840 --> 49:40.720]  going to be successful they'll never be able to carry this out now because of
[49:40.720 --> 49:44.200]  what I've done what you've done and what others have done and then that's not
[49:44.200 --> 49:48.400]  bragging folks they they even admit that in leaked documents that they're never
[49:48.400 --> 49:51.280]  going to succeed now and so all they want to just basically try to kill
[49:51.280 --> 49:54.960]  everybody and then they're just gonna live underground for a few decades till
[49:54.960 --> 49:57.880]  the surface gets cleaned up and then maybe they'll be able to come out and
[49:57.880 --> 50:01.840]  reorganize but then they're not in full control of Russia so they want to hit
[50:01.840 --> 50:05.560]  Russia with nukes first before they even do this I mean this is all global
[50:05.560 --> 50:13.240]  domination maniac behavior because these people all want control they all want
[50:13.240 --> 50:18.680]  power there they're very OCD about that and they're battling for control of the
[50:18.680 --> 50:28.000]  future and so here's what you have to know they're not gonna stop till they're
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.080]  stopped and we have to every step of the way come out and point out hey this
[50:34.080 --> 50:37.720]  shot is it gonna help is gonna make you sicker we told you that again 20 plus
[50:37.720 --> 50:41.240]  months ago it's all true we've got to go and explain now you're gonna see the
[50:41.240 --> 50:43.880]  hospitals full of people dying from side effects they're gonna blame the
[50:43.880 --> 50:47.040]  unvaccinated but the citizens admit that's not what's causing it and you
[50:47.040 --> 50:50.680]  just got to keep hammering and pushing because I go out the street and so does
[50:50.680 --> 50:57.720]  my crew all over the country people are on fire being awake a large minority of
[50:57.720 --> 51:03.000]  people know exactly what's going on a majority of people don't want the shots
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.240]  now because they know so many people got sick or they got sick and that's why
[51:08.240 --> 51:11.800]  the globalists are panicking really trying to force everybody to do it
[51:11.800 --> 51:16.280]  because they don't want a large group of people that aren't sick who didn't take
[51:16.280 --> 51:20.080]  it to be able to point out to the others that did take it who did it to them
[51:20.080 --> 51:24.240]  they want to just say some other future event is what's gonna kill everybody
[51:24.240 --> 51:28.280]  with these soft kill weapons that are being introduced but if there's a big
[51:28.280 --> 51:33.840]  enough control group that isn't taking it that's not gonna work ladies and
[51:33.840 --> 51:39.240]  gentlemen so they plan this whole thing out but here's the thing they're not
[51:39.240 --> 51:43.760]  the only people with brains we know what they're doing and yeah we're gonna get
[51:43.760 --> 51:47.160]  attacked exposing them some of us are gonna get put in prison or killed but
[51:47.160 --> 51:51.840]  that's that's okay because God's watching and everybody's gonna die anyways
[51:51.840 --> 51:55.120]  you gonna sit back and watch them do this to all the children that which are
[51:55.120 --> 51:58.640]  already coming after and already killing trying to abort them after they're
[51:58.640 --> 52:04.800]  born with these shots so admitting the full horror admitting where you are
[52:04.800 --> 52:08.000]  admitting it's real internalizing it and then deciding what you're gonna do
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.200]  about it and then moving forward the best course you've got because you're
[52:13.200 --> 52:17.040]  under this attack this attack is gonna get more intense the enemy is completely
[52:17.040 --> 52:20.440]  committed to it but I can look at their body language and I can read their
[52:20.440 --> 52:23.720]  statements and their leaks they are getting their asses kicked and they've
[52:23.720 --> 52:27.280]  committed to this and convinced themselves they can win this because
[52:27.280 --> 52:31.000]  populace we're taking over all of the world globalism was in deep trouble
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.560]  humanities hopes and dreams were too powerful we weren't gonna accept the
[52:34.560 --> 52:38.560]  carbon taxes and the austerity and all of this and so they've hit us with the
[52:38.560 --> 52:44.160]  virus and this is now war and admitting you're in a war and admitting that you're
[52:44.160 --> 52:50.040]  under attack is the battle it's GI Joe statement but it didn't actually come
[52:50.040 --> 52:53.800]  from GI Joe it's an old Roman saying I'm sure it was said before the Romans but
[52:53.800 --> 52:58.080]  knowing who your enemy is is half the battle
[52:58.920 --> 53:04.520]  Austrian police and army stand up to government health dictatorship that's
[53:04.520 --> 53:09.960]  what they're calling it in their unions mandates will join massive anti-health
[53:09.960 --> 53:13.880]  freedom protests scheduled this Saturday already millions are hitting the
[53:13.880 --> 53:18.440]  streets in Austria and Germany and the police and military know it's crap they're
[53:18.440 --> 53:23.520]  getting sick from the shots they know it's BS and it's the next phase towards
[53:23.520 --> 53:28.080]  going in there and arresting Hitler 2.0 Merkel who would take hours to break it
[53:28.080 --> 53:31.400]  all down but stole elections from the beginning manipulates the parliamentary
[53:31.400 --> 53:37.360]  system is just an absolute witch demon overseeing the giant pedophile rings I
[53:37.360 --> 53:50.160]  mean she is just just a monster and 25% of the Germans died in World War two and
[53:50.160 --> 53:54.920]  then in the next decade after that another couple million disappeared and
[53:54.920 --> 54:00.160]  just imagine the most evil people in the world flocked from our governments and
[54:00.160 --> 54:04.600]  and the Russian government and others into Germany to where they could set up
[54:04.600 --> 54:09.920]  pedophile rings sex slavery that's why you always read and hear about the most
[54:09.920 --> 54:13.120]  snuff films are made in Germany and they've got parties in Germany where
[54:13.120 --> 54:17.160]  people are actually killed that's all real folks I mean Germany is just a hive
[54:17.160 --> 54:25.640]  of evil absolute hive of evil and it just got worse after Hitler and that's
[54:25.640 --> 54:30.800]  who runs NATO when you hear Germany is behind NATO Germany's behind the EU it's
[54:30.800 --> 54:35.440]  not the German people it's that evil got in there and now has a stronghold there
[54:35.440 --> 54:38.680]  and has used the German people that are strong and hard-working but also follow
[54:38.680 --> 54:48.760]  orders to be the implement that launches the world government and so you see what
[54:48.760 --> 54:55.360]  they do in Germany 30,000 children per average town kidnapped and given into
[54:55.360 --> 55:01.600]  sex slavery and that's what they want to do here same people that occupied
[55:01.600 --> 55:05.760]  Germany are now doing everything they did to the Russians everything they did
[55:05.760 --> 55:10.440]  to the Germans is it to be done to us and we need solidarity with the Russians
[55:10.440 --> 55:13.600]  and solidarity with the Germans
[55:15.520 --> 55:24.320]  absolutely essential did my audio just cut out on there oh I have my talk back
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.880]  on accident okay thanks so you know we're here covering all this really scary
[55:28.880 --> 55:33.840]  stuff but once you just get over it then you can start doing something about it
[55:33.840 --> 55:36.120]  because the evil's already going to be there it's going to be coming after
[55:36.120 --> 55:41.920]  with force inoculations and pedophile rings and 5g and gmo and hell on earth
[55:41.920 --> 55:46.000]  USDA announced three weeks ago there's they're started spraying the food with
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.200]  nanotech of this month this is time for Thanksgiving they're just there you're
[55:51.200 --> 55:55.160]  under attack you're in a war and you better just get that through your head
[55:55.160 --> 55:58.600]  and it's time to do it and the good news is the military and police I'm talking
[55:58.600 --> 56:02.880]  to understand what's happening we're gonna go to break and I'm gonna come back
[56:02.880 --> 56:06.440]  and talk more about this but and there's so much other news here but I mean
[56:06.440 --> 56:09.600]  look at this NIH director wants consequences for vaccine conspiracy
[56:09.600 --> 56:13.440]  theories so if you question him and point out he's a lying criminal running the
[56:13.440 --> 56:16.720]  Wuhan lab with Fauci he wants you arrested that's because the boss the head
[56:16.720 --> 56:21.640]  of Pfizer said so see how it works he says it now it's got to be done I got a
[56:21.640 --> 56:25.480]  better idea how about consequences for what you did how much you get arrested
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.920]  in charge with mass murder for creating the virus you pig ladies and gentlemen

[58:50.360 --> 58:54.320]  explain something that is absolutely feed understanding our world it's very
[58:54.320 --> 58:58.800]  very simple but the most people don't know. The privately owned central banks of
[58:58.800 --> 59:04.440]  the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and
[59:04.440 --> 59:10.280]  other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual
[59:10.280 --> 59:16.640]  property energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past
[59:16.640 --> 59:20.640]  they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[59:20.640 --> 59:24.400]  manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general
[59:24.400 --> 59:28.040]  circulation or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone ahead and
[59:28.040 --> 59:32.320]  weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up
[59:32.320 --> 59:37.000]  everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.800]  and force the collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund the
[59:41.800 --> 59:45.240]  only things left standing. This is the great reset this is what's happening now
[59:45.240 --> 59:52.880]  warn everyone it's the only way to stop it. If you are receiving this
[59:52.880 --> 1:00:17.880]  transmission you are the resistance.
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:21.600]  Alright we're back broadcasting worldwide and they have announced that the
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:26.960]  verdict has been reached in the self-defense trial of the century the
[1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:32.280]  written house case and the hero Kyle Rittenhouse and as soon as the judge
[1:00:32.280 --> 1:00:37.160]  comes out and reads the verdict we can put it up on screen guys if you want we
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:43.680]  will go directly to it. Ladies and gentlemen very important and I was
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:46.600]  already intending to open the phones up to talk about really any subject you
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:51.720]  get into but we're gonna have this verdict live and so you're welcome to
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:55.880]  call in about self-defense the written house case or the documents coming out
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:00.160]  that a secret agreement was signed by our government other governments with
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:03.040]  Pfizer to give them dictatorial power over our government I mean that's that's
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:06.360]  the illegal treaty it's it's treason but that that's the corporate crew that's
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:10.480]  going on that's what globalism is the fact that police and military all of the
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:13.960]  world are getting into solidarity and and then one of my crew members is
[1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:19.600]  recently retired out of the army he's he was explaining this to me last night
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:22.680]  this morning and I'm trying to get him to come on the show because he's better
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:28.200]  at explaining it than me because he was a sergeant major in the army but
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:34.960]  memorandum for C description and it's an order he says it's only for like an
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:38.520]  international incident and that once you're given this you know you're about
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:42.960]  to get court-martialed basically and so it's the type of thing that's been
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.080]  issued and of course we've got articles that explain it punishment set for US
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:52.520]  troops who refuse vaccination US Army has threatened repercussions for soldiers
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:57.080]  who decline to receive COVID-19 vaccinations saying that insubordinate
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:01.560]  troops will be barred from promotions re-enlistment a number of special
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:07.920]  military services our personnel refuse the jab include reservists and National
[1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:11.280]  Guard troops will allow to have their service records flagged preventing them
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:15.640]  from receiving favorable personal actions such as re-enlistment bonuses
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:19.920]  promotions of higher-ranked decorations and other rewards and this isn't even
[1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:24.000]  done with the experimental anthrax shots which Congress made him stop doing in
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.360]  the last 20 years two different times and of course we have a copy of the memo
[1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:32.640]  obtained by Defense 1 that was last night authorized commanders to impose bars
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:37.120]  to continued service for all soldiers who refuse mandatory vaccine ordered
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:40.960]  without an approved exemption or pending exemption request and so what they're
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:45.000]  trying to do is just bluff them into knowing that they have a right to
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.760]  question this and a right to declare their exemption but again I'm not the
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:53.960]  expert on this but I'm told this is just over-the-top unprecedented bad
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:03:00.000]  compared to what the news is saying about it it's just crazy but it's designed
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.760]  to run all the good people out of the military ladies and gentlemen it's just
[1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:08.800]  that simple and that's where we are so again we're waiting here on the written
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:14.640]  house case imagine each facing life in prison on the more serious charges and
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:23.160]  the judge has dropped the illegal gun charge because he didn't have the gun
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:29.200]  illegally he wasn't using the gun in the commission of a crime but it's just
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:32.640]  crazy can you imagine the precedent that the left can run around burning
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:36.400]  buildings down and shooting people attacking federal courthouses and then
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:40.640]  the vice president when she's a candidate bails them out of jail and leads
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:46.320]  huge multi-million dollar campaigns to to raise millions of dollars to get
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:51.280]  people out and have charges dropped here we go here's the judge we're gonna
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:04:05.520]  pause this this is live right the we're back and the appearances raised before what

[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.760]  pause this is live right now it won't be live we come back in a minute but our
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:29.360]  stations don't like us skipping breaks and satellites are all pre-programmed so

[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:38.000]  back from the part there and play the reading of the verdict live here on air
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.320]  and of course obviously I welcome the other co-host and people that they're
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:46.240]  doing shows to go in studios and do live uninterrupted covers that'd be a smart
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:49.720]  thing for Owen to do you want to do you can take calls out of their studio the

[1:06:55.480 --> 1:07:03.760]  microphones are silenced and again ladies and gentlemen we will continue as
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:09.240]  this unfolds to cover it while they're waiting for the jury to come in a lot
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:13.960]  of suspense here we've all seen what a hero call written house is and all the
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:18.240]  persecution lies he's been through we've seen the corporate media let's put it
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:25.440]  back on screen for me guys thanks we've seen the corporate media we've seen the
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:28.920]  corporate media do everything they can to throw this case to the looters and
[1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:34.400]  killers and child molesters and we have witnessed them only carry the
[1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:39.600]  prosecution statements and just do all their corruption this will be a major
[1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:44.600]  referendum against the left and the pedophile armies and all the BLM George
[1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:48.440]  Soros scum your TV viewer you can see call written house his mother who's been
[1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:52.160]  a guest on the show she's a listener and we'll be definitely getting her back on

[1:07:57.120 --> 1:08:03.440]  a Kyle written house again I just am having a lot of suspense right now as I
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:11.720]  know you are and we will go to the audio as soon as it's there
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:17.600]  we're just gonna let you have some of the room noise there so that we won't
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:26.160]  miss anything that is said or done here and boy you can cut the suspense with
[1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:29.720]  a knife this is how I feel all the time I mean I'm reading all the documents all
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:32.880]  the admissions that the vaccines are killing people that they're designed to
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:36.080]  slowly kill people that they aren't vaccines they erase your immune system
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:40.280]  and that you're twice as likely to die or be hospitalized or be sick if you take
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:44.240]  them the British government is now admitting all this and it's just it's
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:51.320]  crazy and now they say oh you've got to have more shots and so I don't know what
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:55.800]  to say I don't know what to do at this point it's just incredible and you know
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:59.160]  I can't help it I never do this for our radio stations because we have hard
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:03.920]  coded satellite feed stuff but I'm skipping this break coming up we haven't

[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:10.920]  if they want but we're gonna skip the break coming up here at least on our
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:16.440]  internet feeds and everywhere else because I'm not gonna miss this so as soon
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:24.200]  as again they start speaking you will hear them and I will be quiet what what
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:29.640]  an incredible time to be alive I mean the boring times are over folks business
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:35.720]  as usual is over we are living in a takeover by evil at every level and that's
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:40.320]  what history shows us happens it just goes in cycles and this is gonna be the
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:44.280]  most insane thing ever seen on this planet as the public figures out the
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:47.920]  vaccine's killing them and a large portion of the public goes under stock
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:51.120]  homes send around and can't admit it to themselves and then gets organized
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:54.080]  against those of us that won't take the shots saying things will go back to
[1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:58.840]  normal if you just take it if you just take it as they organize these giant
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:11.400]  masses of idiots against us for those of you in the audience portion no it
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:17.440]  doesn't need to be there there can't be any reaction at all no matter how
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:21.440]  strongly you may feel and this understood that many people do have strong
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:27.640]  feelings but we can't permit any kind permit any kind of a reaction to the
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:31.720]  verdict and as you can see there's quite a bit of law enforcement here and you
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:36.960]  will be whisked out of here if there is any so just be aware
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:44.440]  not jury's coming in and you believe in America it's all on video they still
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:49.000]  trying to put him in prison as George Soros creature very same Soros

[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:02.680]  is the injustice in America that we face will the jury succumbed to the
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:07.040]  satanic brainwashing or will they find him not guilty
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:15.840]  hello would you go now please yes thank you he's telling them bring him out
[1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:24.760]  yep this isn't theater folks this is the real world the real world and you're

[1:12:53.040 --> 1:13:00.040]  you hand all the paperwork to the bailout please everything thanks live
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:10.040]  coverage info wars Kenosha trial the hero call written house November 19th 2021

[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:32.240]  truth potting around the clock calling the white supremacist everything
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:39.560]  building up now to this moment in time right now will they be able to unleash
[1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:44.840]  the giant hordes of leftist criminals face the jury and hearken to its verdicts
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:49.640]  data was gone from the versus Kyle right now that's the first count of the

[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:31.920]  Yes!
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:35.920]  Members of the jury, I believe you are unanimous for this.
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:38.920]  Anyone who does not agree with the verdict says red.
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:40.920]  You failed again, you murdering trash.
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:42.920]  Do you wish the jury pulled?
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:44.920]  Vernon Hill, globalist.
[1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:51.920]  Okay, folks, your job is done and we started just about three weeks ago.
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:58.920]  And I told you it could last two weeks and two days. This is three weeks.
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:04.920]  You were a wonderful jury to work with. You were punctual, you were attentive.
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:14.920]  I had the forgotten six over here who had a very difficult job of keeping from discussing the case.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.920]  Well, that's intimidation. It didn't work, honks.
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.920]  All of you, you just, I couldn't have asked for a better jury to work with.
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:25.920]  And it has truly been my pleasure.
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:29.920]  I think without commenting on your verdict, the verdicts themselves.
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:30.920]  That's a real judge.
[1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:31.920]  Fair was real.
[1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:33.920]  That's why they're putting sorrel people in everywhere.
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:44.920]  Texas elects judges and it justifies the confidence that the founders of our country placed in you.
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:55.920]  So I dismiss you at this time. You're never under any obligation to discuss any aspect of this case with anyone.
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:00.920]  And I guess he doesn't want part of this going out so he cut the feed.
[1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:04.920]  So we're not finding out what happened here.
[1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:10.920]  Because again, this is some private thing the judge once said to the jury without the media hearing it.
[1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:12.920]  But it'll definitely get reported on.
[1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:14.920]  We got to find out what the judge said here, guys.
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:16.920]  Check other channels. Check other things.
[1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:18.920]  Rittenhouse not guilty. Live feed.
[1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:31.920]  They are not to contact you. If anyone does contact you and just tell them you're not interested in discussing it, if that's the case.
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:36.920]  And if anyone persists in doing so, report that to us and it will be addressed.
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:40.920]  I wonder if the families are mad that their panel members aren't allowed to do what they want.
[1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:48.920]  In the beginning of the trial, there was some concern about information and your safety.
[1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:53.920]  And I assure you that we will take every measure to ensure that that is...
[1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:59.920]  I love how our founders enshrine the second amendment to protect ourselves from commie takeovers.
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:05.920]  I'm going to talk to you for just a minute, not about anything to do with the case, but just about that sole issue.
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:15.920]  And you, as I say, you're welcome to discuss the case as little or as much as you want.
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:22.920]  And any questions, anybody? Thank you so much.
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:27.920]  And after four years, you're eligible for service again.
[1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:28.920]  Go hug your mom.
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:31.920]  It would be my pleasure to work with you. Thank you.
[1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:34.920]  Rittenhouse has got the hell out of there.
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:36.920]  Yeah, please.
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:41.920]  Or in the library, it's not going to be more than a minute, or maybe it will be.
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:46.920]  Yeah, take them upstairs. That's fine.
[1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:52.920]  Wow. You just saw history happen. They want the power to attack us and we're not allowed to defend ourselves.
[1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:55.920]  That's why they want to kill babies before they're born because they can't defend themselves
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:17:59.920]  while they're rolling out these poison shots because they can't get our guns.
[1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:02.920]  We got to come in with Country Boy Cancer Valve on the other side.
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:08.920]  They can't starve us out and they can't make us run because these old boys were raised on shotguns.
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.920]  We say, Grace, we say, man, if you ain't into that, we don't give a damn.
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:18.920]  So the Second Amendment is for every American regardless of race, color, or creed.
[1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:23.920]  It's our right to defend our property and it's our right to stand up if people are trying to kill us.
[1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:29.920]  And the little, fancy pants, Soros creature with all his lies and all his intimidation
[1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:36.920]  and all his crap got beaten because there was a good judge who was appointed by a Democrat,
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:41.920]  but that was an old school Democrat. Not now with these Soros judges, folks.
[1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:46.920]  They will do anything and that's why we've got to stop the takeover of our local towns.
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:49.920]  We've got to stop all the Soros people.
[1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:54.920]  Soros spent a couple million last election and got almost all the people he wanted put into judgeships
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:58.920]  and the new DA who's an admitted communist.
[1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:04.920]  And so, I mean, and I'm living under, people say, well, why do you show in Austin?
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:08.920]  Well, my family's been here since the start of the state and our officers are here.
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:10.920]  I don't have the money to move it. Give me $5 million.
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:14.920]  That's what would take to set up all this new stuff and move into a new place and do it all.
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:16.920]  Do it. I'll leave now.
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:19.920]  I'll move to, like, Northeast Texas, which is very conservative.
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:21.920]  Believe me, we need to get out of here.
[1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:25.920]  But, I mean, this is where we live.
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:30.920]  Okay? So, and, you know, if I leave here and they take over the next town, I'm going to leave there.
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:32.920]  I'm always going to keep running.
[1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:36.920]  But Kyle Rittenhouse stopped running, didn't he?
[1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:41.920]  He stopped running after days of things being burned and people getting stabbed and killed.
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:45.920]  He said, you know what? They're getting close to my dad's house where I stay the weekends.
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:47.920]  They're getting next to my dad's business.
[1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:49.920]  I'm going to go out there and I'm going to try to help people.
[1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:52.920]  I'm going to try to put out fires. I'm going to have a gun. I'm going to defend myself.
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:56.920]  And then here comes a mob of people looking for trouble.
[1:19:56.920 --> 1:20:01.920]  Well, you know what? They fucked around and they found out, didn't they?
[1:20:01.920 --> 1:20:26.920]  Well, they're right back, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us.
[1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:45.920]  It came out more than five years ago in his own company documents,
[1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:51.920]  when whistleblowers warned the world that he was trying to isolate people to be only on Facebook
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:58.920]  and to be depressed and alone so that avatars or fake computer entities would be their only friends,
[1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:01.920]  just taking full control of the user's mind.
[1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:08.920]  That's just a beta test for what's now rolling out with Facebook claiming ownership of the metaverse
[1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:14.920]  and buying up hundreds of VR companies and now trying to force its users and employees
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:19.920]  to solely live in a fantasy world controlled and orchestrated by Zuckerberg
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:22.920]  and the organizations that he works with.
[1:21:22.920 --> 1:21:27.920]  This priest class wants to lock us in our five senses here in the third dimension
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:34.920]  and to do that they're creating an artificial electronic prison or matrix to seduce us
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:38.920]  into giving up control of our bodies and our minds.
[1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:41.920]  This is the greatest deception ever.
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:47.920]  Evil is digging in because it knows humanity is waking up and that group consciousness is forming
[1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:51.920]  and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension.
[1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:56.920]  Everything that's being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension
[1:21:56.920 --> 1:22:00.920]  and not just enslave us but finally completely destroy us
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:04.920]  and absorb our energy into this system they're building.
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:06.920]  This is beyond the Satanic ritual.
[1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:09.920]  This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction
[1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:13.920]  because this is actually happening in the real world today
[1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:15.920]  and we have discovered their secrets.
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:20.920]  We've discovered how to stop them and we have put it all together in an easy to understand system
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:26.920]  that gives you the tools to not just defeat the globalists but to transcend to the next level.
[1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:30.920]  It's so important for all of you that already know this enable
[1:22:30.920 --> 1:22:32.920]  and have already witnessed this for yourselves to understand
[1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:36.920]  you are the leaders of the future that must go to the next level
[1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:41.920]  so that you and I and others working together can free the rest of humanity
[1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:45.920]  before they get trapped in this artificial matrix system that the globalists are building.
[1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:46.920]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:49.920]  The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original.
[1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:53.920]  Documents came out in 1990 from the late 1970s
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:58.920]  where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan very similar to The Matrix
[1:22:58.920 --> 1:23:00.920]  and all that information is now public.
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:04.920]  They're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:06.920]  not just holding us in the third dimension
[1:23:06.920 --> 1:23:09.920]  but actually creating an artificial slave system
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:13.920]  so that they can turn us into their programmable slaves.
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:18.920]  Humanity are not robots no matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers tell us this
[1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:22.920]  but they are trying to turn us into robots.
[1:23:22.920 --> 1:23:26.920]  That's why in December of 2021 we are launching Reset Wars.
[1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:49.920]  Find out more information at resetwars.com.
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:02.920]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines
[1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:06.920]  and the rocky mountains and the western skies
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:13.920]  and we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line
[1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:16.920]  and a country boy can survive
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:19.920]  Country folks can survive
[1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:21.920]  It doesn't matter what color you are
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:24.920]  you need to get back to land and protect yourself.
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:27.920]  I had a good friend in New York City
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:31.920]  He never called me by my name just he'll bill him
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:38.920]  My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:42.920]  and he has taught him to be a business man
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:50.920]  He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:54.920]  and I'd send him some homemade wine
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:01.920]  but he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:05.920]  for $43 my friend lost his life
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:08.920]  I'd like to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:12.920]  I'd love to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye
[1:25:12.920 --> 1:25:15.920]  but shoot him with my old 45
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:17.920]  cause a country boy can survive
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:21.920]  Well the left are running around like a bunch of rabies ridden rats
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:28.920]  and they're gonna burn more stuff down
[1:25:28.920 --> 1:25:32.920]  but that's okay cause now folks know they can protect themselves
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:34.920]  and now they're not able to villainize
[1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:37.920]  somebody standing up for their rights
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:49.920]  and it's one more victory we're gonna have
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:52.920]  If you're a radio listener you're not having to look at the left
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:55.920]  throw fits outside
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:57.920]  but now Kyle's gonna be hunted by these scum
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:25:59.920]  they don't need security
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:01.920]  I guess he's got a second amendment
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:03.920]  I just can't wait to get him on the show
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:05.920]  I know his mom said as soon as this ordeal was over
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.920]  he'd be on the show
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:12.920]  and we're just glad that folks are surviving
[1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:15.920]  don't take the shot and don't let the thugs kill you
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:18.920]  survive my friends and thrive
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:21.920]  well let's open the phones up for everybody now

[1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:58.920]  I was already planning to have open phones
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:00.920]  in the first hour
[1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:02.920]  and I said on air I predicted
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:04.920]  it wasn't a hard prediction I really think
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:06.920]  I said I think you'll be found not guilty on everything
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:08.920]  and I think the weapons charge will be dropped and it was
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:10.920]  and I said though it's
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:14.920]  I got a bad feeling about them taking so long
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:16.920]  but I think they were just very deliberative
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:17.920]  they reviewed all the videos
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:19.920]  they double-checked all the evidence
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:22.920]  and they said you young man are not a criminal
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:26.920]  you young man are a hero
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:28.920]  and doesn't that fly in the face of the narrative
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:31.920]  of the pedophile left
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:33.920]  at the end of the day they want to destroy our children
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:36.920]  and destroy our futures
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:39.920]  and have big leftist mobs funded by George Soros
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:42.920]  terrorize us and have George Soros prosecutors
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:44.920]  put any men or women that stand up
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:49.920]  and defend their selves or their community in prison
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:54.920]  but another big fat burning hell George Soros
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:56.920]  877-789-2539
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:27:58.920]  and then you're welcome to call it out
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:00.920]  all the other craziness
[1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:02.920]  you know Gozer puts a little joke anime meme
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:04.920]  with violence against AOC
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:06.920]  something the left does constantly
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:08.920]  and he's censured by the house of representatives
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:11.920]  but then we've got video compilations of hours of them
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:14.920]  you know killing Republicans is a joke
[1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:19.920]  it's all one-sided justice with them
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.920]  it's all baloney all BS all fraud
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.920]  the big banks the big tech the big courts
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:29.920]  all of it working to suppress the people
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:31.920]  believing they just as they bought the country up
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:33.920]  with fraudulent money they printed up
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:35.920]  that it's theirs it's not yours
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:37.920]  our houses aren't ours I mean under their system
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:39.920]  our guns aren't ours our children aren't ours
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:41.920]  but they are ours
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:43.920]  and we're taking it back
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:45.920]  we're saying no you don't owe me
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:47.920]  you don't control me
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:49.920]  I'm not your slave
[1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:50.920]  and you're not going to disarm me
[1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:52.920]  you're not going to put your poison garbage in my body
[1:28:52.920 --> 1:28:55.920]  you're the people that cooked up the freaking virus on record
[1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:56.920]  so many people say
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:28:59.920]  there are so many crappy brands

[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:09.920]  but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides
[1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:12.920]  horrible crashes and

[1:30:56.920 --> 1:30:58.920]  so
[1:30:58.920 --> 1:31:00.920]  when I first started taking survival shield
[1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:02.920]  basically I was 275 pounds
[1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:04.920]  I was overweight I had brain fog
[1:31:04.920 --> 1:31:06.920]  like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on
[1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:08.920]  to a job and I heard doctor group
[1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:10.920]  on your show and I listened to it so the first
[1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:12.920]  one I got was the original survival shield
[1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:14.920]  x1 and it worked pretty good
[1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:16.920]  and then shortly thereafter you came out with
[1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:18.920]  x2 you had with the deep burden source
[1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:20.920]  and I got really excited about that so I took it
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:22.920]  and man in two weeks I went from
[1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:24.920]  brain fog to like literally
[1:31:24.920 --> 1:31:26.920]  like my brain was enlightened
[1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:28.920]  you know I could think again I could
[1:31:28.920 --> 1:31:30.920]  connect with people again and over
[1:31:30.920 --> 1:31:32.920]  the course of the next couple of years
[1:31:32.920 --> 1:31:34.920]  I got my health back and I religiously
[1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:36.920]  take basically all of your supplements
[1:31:36.920 --> 1:31:38.920]  they're all absolutely amazing supplements
[1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:40.920]  the one I like recently is knockout
[1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:42.920]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it
[1:31:42.920 --> 1:31:44.920]  it's amazing it works but anyway
[1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:46.920]  so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[1:31:46.920 --> 1:31:48.920]  we have to break free of the globalist
[1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:50.920]  system and the only way to do that is to
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:52.920]  take our own health into our own hand
[1:31:52.920 --> 1:31:54.920]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much

[1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:28.920]  Alex Jones
[1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:30.920]  you know I don't like cheap
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:32.920]  dopamine hits playing video games
[1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:34.920]  where you kill the big
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:36.920]  boss at the end and you
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:38.920]  can play in the game for three weeks trying to
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:40.920]  get past that final level I mean I did that when I was young
[1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:42.920]  I always have a headache after it wouldn't
[1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:44.920]  feel fulfilled but when I
[1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:46.920]  want a real fight I feel good for a long
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:48.920]  time or when I actually
[1:33:48.920 --> 1:33:50.920]  went out and dated the
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.920]  beauty queen or whatever I mean it
[1:33:52.920 --> 1:33:54.920]  felt good as it was real porn doesn't
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:56.920]  feel good it's not real folks
[1:33:56.920 --> 1:33:58.920]  and see the metaverse
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:00.920]  wants to rope you all into this so
[1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:02.920]  do I get excited when
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:04.920]  a football team wins the game
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:06.920]  no because it doesn't really matter
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:08.920]  to me and my family in my future now
[1:34:08.920 --> 1:34:10.920]  when Tom Brady makes it political doesn't wear
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:12.920]  a mask says he loves America doesn't
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:14.920]  like black lives matter now I actually
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:16.920]  will watch Tom Brady
[1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:18.920]  because he's somebody that has courage
[1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:20.920]  because off the field he's somebody
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:22.920]  I admire
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:24.920]  and then you can see what a great athlete he is
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:26.920]  and then he's a whole person
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:28.920]  and now I can admire the athlete
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:30.920]  but I can't admire incredible
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:32.920]  athletes even though I do admire them
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:34.920]  at a base level I admire
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:36.920]  humanity and God's creations
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:38.920]  but it just takes it all away when they're
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:40.920]  jerks it makes it worse
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:42.920]  imagine the NFL
[1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:44.920]  made up of a bunch of Tom Brady's
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:46.920]  not by force but
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:48.920]  by free will
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:50.920]  you know that would have 10 times the ratings
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:52.920]  it has but see it's controlled
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:54.920]  so I don't get
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:56.920]  dopamine rushes watching
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:34:58.920]  the NFL or playing
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:00.920]  video games or porn or any of that
[1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:02.920]  but you know what
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:04.920]  I got a big fat dopamine rush
[1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:06.920]  when Kyle Rittenhouse just got found not guilty
[1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:08.920]  next segment we'll play that verdict again
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:10.920]  because
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:12.920]  that was defeating the media lies
[1:35:12.920 --> 1:35:14.920]  the propaganda the one side of garbage
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:16.920]  the Soros money funding the riots
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:18.920]  funding the prosecutor
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:20.920]  and you know what I'm up against
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:22.920]  the very same people
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:24.920]  trying to destroy my life trying to just do
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:26.920]  horrible things to me
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:28.920]  and so I'm on
[1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:30.920]  the Rittenhouse team
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:32.920]  that's a real field he was on
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:34.920]  and I admire him and his
[1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:36.920]  victory is our victory
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:40.920]  so savor this victory right now
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:42.920]  savor it and then think about all the victories
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:44.920]  we've already won against evil
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:46.920]  because of God's support
[1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:48.920]  and how we can't let the devil
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:50.920]  win in the end or everything our ancestors
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:52.920]  did is for nothing
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:54.920]  because this is a
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:56.920]  10,000 year long sudden death
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:35:58.920]  over time super bowl for the whole
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:00.920]  future
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:02.920]  and we just
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:04.920]  got in
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:10.920]  the winning column with this
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:12.920]  and with the police all over the world
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:14.920]  rallying with the citizens and saying no to the lockdowns
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:16.920]  we're moving back in the right direction
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:18.920]  let's see some more of that right now
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:20.920]  let's decide to stop rolling over
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:22.920]  and stop giving it into evil
[1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:26.920]  let's decide to be alive again
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:28.920]  and get past all the
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:30.920]  the BS manipulations
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:32.920]  get past all the concerns
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:34.920]  that oh well something might happen
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:36.920]  if I stand up and speak out
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:38.920]  something's gonna happen if you don't speak out
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:40.920]  you're gonna be a slave
[1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:42.920]  you think a nation of written houses
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:44.920]  could be enslaved
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:46.920]  you think a nation of written houses would be prosperous
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:48.920]  yeah you know it would be
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.920]  so let's all be more like Rittenhouse
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:52.920]  and that doesn't mean we go out
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:54.920]  and start some fight
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:56.920]  or that doesn't mean we look for trouble
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:36:58.920]  but it means that we don't get pushed around
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:00.920]  so mess with our children
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:04.920]  so yeah
[1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:06.920]  I'm high as a kite right now
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:08.920]  and I'm gonna control myself
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:12.920]  but I've had the very same scum
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:14.920]  sink their things into me
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:16.920]  and it doesn't make me want to back off
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:18.920]  it makes me want to fight
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:20.920]  makes me want to win
[1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:22.920]  and I know that young man's been put through more than I have
[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:24.920]  and all my ears are being persecuted
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:26.920]  and he rose to the occasion that night
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:28.920]  and he rose the occasion
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:30.920]  in the last year
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:32.920]  and he sat there in that jail cell
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:34.920]  and now
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:36.920]  Rittenhouse ladies and gentlemen
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:38.920]  is a free man vindicated
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:40.920]  and the mainstream corporate media and all their lies
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:42.920]  have had a giant
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:44.920]  verdict of no confidence
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:46.920]  from the American people yet again
[1:37:46.920 --> 1:37:48.920]  and all these other corrupt
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:50.920]  judiciary
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:52.920]  that drop charges on antifa
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:54.920]  that shoot people
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:56.920]  and such folks that defend themselves
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:37:58.920]  now know what
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:00.920]  trash they are
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:02.920]  and they see what a real judge
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:04.920]  and real justice looks like
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:06.920]  alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls here
[1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:12.920]  just tuned in
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:14.920]  if you're a radio listener and I didn't suddenly turn into Beavis and Butthead
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:16.920]  they put up a graphic of
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:18.920]  that's hilarious of the prosecutor
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:20.920]  he is, he's Butthead
[1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:22.920]  oh my gosh
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:24.920]  shut up Beavis
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:26.920]  why were you in Kenosha
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:28.920]  you don't live there
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:30.920]  my dad does
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:34.920]  come on Beavis
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:36.920]  come on Butthead let's go whack off
[1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:38.920]  in the tool shed
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:40.920]  you know I'd hung out with my judge
[1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:42.920]  in so long because I don't hang out
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:44.920]  I don't go out to dinner, I don't go out drinking
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:46.920]  he's to be a really good friend of mine
[1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:48.920]  I'm not quite a bit
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:50.920]  I've done more wild things with him
[1:38:50.920 --> 1:38:52.920]  than with Joe Rogan
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:54.920]  but I just in the war
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:56.920]  I hadn't had time but he's like
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:38:58.920]  oh my god I need to go have some fun with my judge
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:00.920]  I just get reminded
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:02.920]  how funny he is in person
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:04.920]  imagine like driving down the road
[1:39:04.920 --> 1:39:06.920]  or being on his ranch eating barbecue while he's shooting
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:08.920]  a 50 caliber rifle talking like Butthead
[1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:10.920]  it just doesn't get better than that
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:12.920]  mmm
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:14.920]  alright
[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:16.920]  I said I'd go to your phone calls but I'm kind of
[1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:18.920]  drunk right now
[1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:20.920]  I haven't had any alcohol but I feel drunk
[1:39:22.920 --> 1:39:24.920]  a lot of endorphins and a big weight off too
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:26.920]  I know you're feeling it too
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:28.920]  how may I just go take this jacket off
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:30.920]  and put on a t-shirt
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:32.920]  I'm just
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:34.920]  oh god
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:36.920]  because you know
[1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:38.920]  there's a lot of innocent people getting hurt by evil right now
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:40.920]  and so just because we had this victory
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:42.920]  doesn't mean we don't have a lot of work to do
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:44.920]  I'm gonna go to break and I'm gonna come right back
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:46.920]  with Carlos
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:48.920]  and John and Brad and Steve and Steve and Alex
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:50.920]  and Robert and Jacob
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:52.920]  and Stan and others
[1:39:52.920 --> 1:39:54.920]  one part of staying on the air and winning this war
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:56.920]  is you supporting us
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:39:58.920]  which I really appreciate but we need support
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:00.920]  we're fighting the whole George Soros
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:02.920]  Bloomberg
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:04.920]  Democratic Party organization
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:06.920]  we have a strategy to win
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:08.920]  not in a way that
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:10.920]  they would think it was a victory but
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:12.920]  staying on the air and actually expanding is the victory
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:14.920]  so we cannot let them cut
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:16.920]  into our operation funds
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:18.920]  to expand the fight
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:20.920]  they're trying to pin us down
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:22.920]  because we're key in the fight against the New World Order
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:24.920]  so it's key, they're not making me
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:26.920]  get bigger because I'm doing that for them
[1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:28.920]  but the fact that we're so persecuted
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:30.920]  reminds me that
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:32.920]  I've got to work 18 hours a day
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:34.920]  and so films, you know so much more
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:36.920]  collaborations, so many other things are going to be launched
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:38.920]  in the next few months
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:40.920]  starting with reset wars
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:42.920]  that you'll all learn about coming up in December
[1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:44.920]  you can go there and sign up for free to get
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:46.920]  special videos, reports, you name it
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:48.920]  at resetwars.com
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:50.920]  but the big thing to do is to go to
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:52.920]  saveinfowars.com
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:40:56.920]  saveinfowars.com
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:40:58.920]  and that is the give send go
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:00.920]  account
[1:41:00.920 --> 1:41:02.920]  and when you go there
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:04.920]  it
[1:41:04.920 --> 1:41:06.920]  allows us to stay on air and operate
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:08.920]  and it sounds like a lot of money, $2 million
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:10.920]  we have six different Democratic
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:12.920]  party funded lawsuits
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:14.920]  that are going to go to trial in the next year
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:16.920]  they run from
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:18.920]  March through
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:20.920]  what is it, September
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:22.920]  six of their lawsuits
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:24.920]  four of them Sandy Hook, one Charlottesville
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:26.920]  and one of them is another one that's a side issue
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:28.920]  so five major ones
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:30.920]  so they can just constantly keep it in the headlines
[1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:32.920]  it's going to be on TV, I'm not going to be able to even defend myself
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:34.920]  it's always already guilty
[1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:36.920]  lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.920]  what you do to respond to stuff like you just saw with
[1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:40.920]  written house with a real court
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:42.920]  but that's okay, people are going to see that outrage
[1:41:42.920 --> 1:41:44.920]  and just how over the top it is
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:46.920]  and wake up, that's what they haven't gotten like
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:48.920]  I have these media people call up threatening me
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:50.920]  like you better interview with us or we'll
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:52.920]  you know the Bob Woodward rule
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:54.920]  we'll really go hard on you
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:41:56.920]  and I'm like go hard as you want
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:41:58.920]  worse is better
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:00.920]  give me my licks
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:02.920]  you think
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:04.920]  you think you people have any control over me
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:06.920]  control over me
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:08.920]  you think you scare me
[1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:10.920]  when I know who you work for
[1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:12.920]  and you're in deep trouble with God
[1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:14.920]  I fear God not you, you understand that
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:16.920]  just get that
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:18.920]  through your mind
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:20.920]  I just got to control myself
[1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:22.920]  that's my only issue

[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:30.920]  quite frankly again it'll cost more than
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:32.920]  two million dollars to fight this
[1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:34.920]  and the appeals and all of it's way more than that
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:36.920]  so if you
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:38.920]  this isn't like it's my decision
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:40.920]  this is up to you whether we continue on
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:42.920]  at the level we're at or whether these people
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:44.920]  helped shut us down even beforehand we run out of money
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:46.920]  something they're fighting all behind the scenes to do right now
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:48.920]  so I need money to fight these people

[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:46.920]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others who leave the chart
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.920]  want with infowars but it's not enough
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:50.920]  every individual has to not comply
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:52.920]  and we have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:54.920]  you see they need the fear of God
[1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:56.920]  put in them legally and lawfully
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:44:58.920]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:00.920]  for almost 28 years
[1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:02.920]  against the globalist
[1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:04.920]  to stop their agenda
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:06.920]  I wanted to wake up the world
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:08.920]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:10.920]  before they went operational
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:12.920]  but we failed, yes a lot of people are awake
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:14.920]  yes we're not getting caught flat footed
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:16.920]  but they are going ahead
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:18.920]  with their full operational
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:20.920]  deindustrialization great reset
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:22.920]  and that's why it's more important than ever
[1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:24.920]  than all viewers and all listeners
[1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:26.920]  tell everybody they know about the show
[1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:28.920]  because people are ready to wake up

[1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:32.920]  and prepare the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:34.920]  we've also got to get personally prepared
[1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:36.920]  and one of the number one things to do
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:38.920]  is high quality, storeable food

[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:30.920]  awesome win for America
[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:32.920]  hopefully whenever
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:34.920]  we get a good judge on some of your cases
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:36.920]  it's going to be the same exact thing
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:38.920]  as long as they're patriots
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:40.920]  well I mean it's not
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:42.920]  I mean literally the judge in Texas
[1:47:42.920 --> 1:47:44.920]  even the Democrats say
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:46.920]  is the worst judge they've ever seen
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:48.920]  on all her cases a total judicial
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:50.920]  tyrant
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:52.920]  just absolutely out of control
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:54.920]  and I mean she defaulted Owen Schreuer
[1:47:54.920 --> 1:47:56.920]  who they've never deposed
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:47:58.920]  or subpoenaed and sent a letter
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:00.920]  she certified that he didn't respond
[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:02.920]  and that he is defaulted
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:04.920]  right there
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:06.920]  I mean that's how crazy these people
[1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:08.920]  they don't even respond to us
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:10.920]  they don't even respond to us
[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:12.920]  when we like hey we want to depose you
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:14.920]  we don't even get a response
[1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:16.920]  we're told you give us everything
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:18.920]  we do and they go you gave us nothing
[1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:20.920]  it's okay
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:22.920]  that's a civil that's a civil issue
[1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:24.920]  what we do is we force it all the way through
[1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:26.920]  you understand I don't get a jury trial sir
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:28.920]  they found me guilty
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:30.920]  by a judge
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:32.920]  in default and then a jury decides how guilty I am
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:34.920]  okay which I don't want to get into
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:36.920]  me anymore I don't want to talk about me
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:38.920]  I'm not worried about that they're coming after our kids with poison shots
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:40.920]  they're coming at us with the world government
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:42.920]  they're collapsing the borders
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:44.920]  keeping info wars on air is key
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:46.920]  not worrying about
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:48.920]  the kangaroo operation
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:50.920]  I just have to go through the kangaroo operation
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:52.920]  be on national TV
[1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:54.920]  not be allowed to defend myself to be demonized
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:56.920]  that's okay I don't care
[1:48:56.920 --> 1:48:58.920]  I can handle it it means nothing to me
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:00.920]  what matters to me is staying on air
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:02.920]  and people spread the word so we save the children
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:04.920]  and defeat the pedophile armies you understand
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:06.920]  yes sir I understand
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:08.920]  now you've been on fire this week
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:10.920]  this week you reached
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:12.920]  so many people
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:14.920]  that were dumbed down
[1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:16.920]  they had no clue
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:18.920]  and now they see the truth has come out
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:20.920]  I've had to explain
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:22.920]  in baby terms to people
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:24.920]  that this is a plan
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:26.920]  by satan
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:28.920]  dead and fourth in motion many years ago
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:30.920]  and now
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:32.920]  you waking up
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:34.920]  thankfully you woke me up more than 10 years
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:36.920]  still Alice
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:38.920]  I thank you for that and I've been able to wake up
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:40.920]  lots of people but you
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:42.920]  going to the forefront
[1:49:42.920 --> 1:49:44.920]  being with Joe
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:46.920]  being with Tim Pool
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:48.920]  being with all these guys
[1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:50.920]  all these heavy hitters
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:52.920]  that are making the difference
[1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:54.920]  they're putting you
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:56.920]  not necessarily on the map
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:58.920]  you've been on the map
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:00.920]  but your message is going mainstream
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:02.920]  everything that was once hidden
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:04.920]  that you can only hear on info wars
[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:06.920]  you've said it plenty of time
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:08.920]  I hear you brother it's beautiful
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:10.920]  John and Florida you're on the air welcome
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:12.920]  hey Alex
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:14.920]  I just wanted to say God bless Mr. Rittenhouse
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:16.920]  you know I was
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:18.920]  I was expecting a hung jury
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:20.920]  that way the prosecution
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:22.920]  everybody would still riot
[1:50:22.920 --> 1:50:24.920]  and then they could charge him again
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:26.920]  Mr. Rittenhouse sadly
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:28.920]  I don't believe he's out of the woods yet
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:30.920]  I think the feds are going to try some sort of civil rights
[1:50:30.920 --> 1:50:32.920]  violation against him
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:34.920]  but hopefully he stands strong
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:36.920]  I know God is on his side
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:38.920]  one of the main reasons I want to talk to you
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:40.920]  was the upcoming smallpox
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:42.920]  problem that's about to be unleashed
[1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:44.920]  in 2018
[1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:46.920]  and then again July
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:48.920]  of this year 2021
[1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:50.920]  the FDA approved
[1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:52.920]  two separate drugs one in 2018
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:54.920]  and one this year for the treatment of smallpox
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:50:56.920]  why is the FDA
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:50:58.920]  doing treatment of smallpox drugs
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:00.920]  when smallpox has been eradicated since 1970
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:02.920]  and suddenly Bill Gates is connected
[1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:04.920]  to those drugs at least one
[1:51:04.920 --> 1:51:06.920]  that's about saying we're going to be hit by smallpox
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:08.920]  and now the FBI finds some
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:10.920]  in some lab in Philadelphia
[1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:12.920]  they're getting ready they're pre-programming
[1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:14.920]  Alex there are some natural
[1:51:14.920 --> 1:51:16.920]  herbal remedies for that
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:18.920]  and I wanted to follow you
[1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:20.920]  and get your R&D team on some of that stuff
[1:51:20.920 --> 1:51:22.920]  you know and get out there
[1:51:22.920 --> 1:51:24.920]  to the people to really help people
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:26.920]  because listen any treatments
[1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:28.920]  that they're going to be offering
[1:51:28.920 --> 1:51:30.920]  they're not going to be given it to anybody
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:32.920]  who's refused the COVID plan
[1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:34.920]  this is all part of their plan
[1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:36.920]  they're coming for us they're coming to kill us
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:38.920]  and they're not going to stop
[1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:40.920]  it's just not going to stop
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:42.920]  our government is occupied by an exterminist
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:44.920]  dehumanization
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:46.920]  depopulation death cult
[1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:48.920]  beautifully said and you're totally right John
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:50.920]  we should be saying
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:52.920]  what happens to the written house next
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:54.920]  a civil rights criminal charges
[1:51:54.920 --> 1:51:56.920]  I know that the feds have talked about that
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:51:58.920]  and you think well that's outrageous
[1:51:58.920 --> 1:52:00.920]  he was shown to be not guilty
[1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:02.920]  of what the government is
[1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:04.920]  or they may do a civil rights suit
[1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:06.920]  against him or private suits against him
[1:52:06.920 --> 1:52:08.920]  you better believe they're going to keep coming after
[1:52:08.920 --> 1:52:10.920]  written house but this victory is so big
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:12.920]  they might be smart enough to drop it
[1:52:12.920 --> 1:52:14.920]  but who knows great point
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:16.920]  and how bad will the riots be tonight
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:18.920]  with the National Guard in Kenosha
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:20.920]  you know honestly
[1:52:20.920 --> 1:52:22.920]  I don't know
[1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:24.920]  I hope they're calm and peaceful
[1:52:24.920 --> 1:52:26.920]  and I hope we don't end up having another situation
[1:52:26.920 --> 1:52:28.920]  where somebody else has to defend themselves
[1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:30.920]  I think that people they're evil
[1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:32.920]  bastards and
[1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:34.920]  it's got to stop and it's got to stop now
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:36.920]  one one quick point I want to make
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:38.920]  two here Alex before you let me go
[1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:40.920]  I know you're trying to get to other callers
[1:52:40.920 --> 1:52:42.920]  here in America we need what I like to call
[1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:44.920]  the great migration
[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:46.920]  we really truly truly need to have
[1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:48.920]  people leave these blue states
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:50.920]  and move to red states and it's got to happen
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:52.920]  it's got to happen at war to see
[1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:54.920]  there is no saving the federal government
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:56.920]  it is lost it is completely
[1:52:56.920 --> 1:52:58.920]  the only way to save this country
[1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:00.920]  is to have people move
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:02.920]  to red states where you can hold the line
[1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:04.920]  and then we declare independence
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:06.920]  from the federal government
[1:53:06.920 --> 1:53:08.920]  that is the only way
[1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:10.920]  I agree with you sir and I appreciate your call
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:12.920]  we can have a huge epiphany
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:14.920]  and the military and police join us in solidarity
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:16.920]  and march on all the major capitals
[1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:18.920]  and say no and just stop complying
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:20.920]  and say Fauci cooked up the weapon
[1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:22.920]  they release the virus they need to all go to prison
[1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:24.920]  over and over again that's why they've got
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:26.920]  Fauci and all them calling for us to be put in prison
[1:53:26.920 --> 1:53:28.920]  because they want to flip the script
[1:53:28.920 --> 1:53:30.920]  so I don't agree with you that's the only way
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:32.920]  but I think it's the surest way is to
[1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:34.920]  migrate, occupy, take over governments
[1:53:34.920 --> 1:53:36.920]  legally and lawfully and be all of us
[1:53:36.920 --> 1:53:38.920]  politically active it's just super hyper
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:40.920]  in the left's face to win victories
[1:53:40.920 --> 1:53:42.920]  when we stand up and take action we win
[1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:44.920]  when we don't they take over so
[1:53:44.920 --> 1:53:46.920]  you're going to have to get political
[1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:48.920]  you're going to have to take action or we're all going to lose
[1:53:48.920 --> 1:53:50.920]  that's why the general flood interview
[1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:52.920]  that's right at the top of band.video

[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:22.920]  thank you Alex
[2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:24.920]  just um
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:26.920]  congratulations for justice having been rendered
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:28.920]  it's hopeful it
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:30.920]  as a Canadian I can tell you
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:32.920]  it gives me great joy to know that America
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:34.920]  works
[2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:36.920]  there's a lot of threat to the
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:38.920]  republic and I want to just
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:40.920]  draw your attention to something
[2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:42.920]  which the Founding Fathers
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:44.920]  did not specifically put
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:46.920]  in the Constitution
[2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:48.920]  of the United States
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:50.920]  and that is inherent
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:52.920]  in the name the
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:54.920]  United States
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:01:56.920]  if at any one point
[2:01:56.920 --> 2:01:58.920]  the Founding Fathers could have changed the name
[2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:00.920]  could have called it Columbia America
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:02.920]  or whatever America Viscucci
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:04.920]  whatever they could have called it
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:06.920]  but they called it and they left the name
[2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:08.920]  United States
[2:02:08.920 --> 2:02:10.920]  if there should ever be tyranny
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:12.920]  if there should ever be a rogue president
[2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:14.920]  or a rogue congress
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:16.920]  or a break down of
[2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:18.920]  the check and balances in your system
[2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:20.920]  the name
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:22.920]  the United States
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:24.920]  of America then are not
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:26.920]  united anymore
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:28.920]  the individual states become
[2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:30.920]  individual republics to become
[2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:32.920]  governors become presidents
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:34.920]  if you know what I mean
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:36.920]  absolutely they then break up
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:38.920]  and create new compacts
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:40.920]  or new governments if they see fit
[2:02:40.920 --> 2:02:42.920]  that's in the Declaration of Independence
[2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:44.920]  exactly and that is exactly
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:46.920]  the issue can you imagine
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:48.920]  some rogue
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:50.920]  usurper or even
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:52.920]  you know
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:54.920]  enjoy the ripper you know trying to do something
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:56.920]  along the lines of having the military
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.920]  against the civilians in a particular state
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:00.920]  the government can say wait a second
[2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:02.920]  no no no it ain't working
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:04.920]  all the governors of the states
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:06.920]  can in fact stand
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:08.920]  and protect their individual
[2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:10.920]  citizens
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:12.920]  and they have a responsibility
[2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:14.920]  against tyranny or against
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:16.920]  for an invasion of course
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:18.920]  and I just simply wanted to draw your attention
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:20.920]  that if it really came down to that
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:22.920]  the United States could be divided
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:24.920]  states temporarily until
[2:03:24.920 --> 2:03:26.920]  their republic was rebuilt
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:28.920]  absolutely we can have the
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:30.920]  that's what I was going to say the last caller
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:32.920]  that the federal government's now rogue
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:34.920]  and not real
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:36.920]  pull out and have their own constitutional convention
[2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:38.920]  or their own new declaration
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:40.920]  of independence and then reconstitute
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:42.920]  and that's the globalist plan to do that
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:44.920]  down the road and break the country up
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:46.920]  we don't want that to happen we want
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:48.920]  if we broke it up break it up to put it back together
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:50.920]  thank you Alex and I just
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:52.920]  just a minor comment tonight
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:54.920]  President Trump
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:56.920]  still remains a viable
[2:03:56.920 --> 2:03:58.920]  American he's done
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:00.920]  great things for America
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:02.920]  unfortunately he didn't have
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:04.920]  enough political experience
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:06.920]  or a team behind him and he
[2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:08.920]  couldn't choose who to bring into
[2:04:08.920 --> 2:04:10.920]  I remember very clearly
[2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:12.920]  having a shared
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:14.920]  conversation with yourself
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:16.920]  and an individual I believe
[2:04:16.920 --> 2:04:18.920]  his name was Joe Bannister
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:20.920]  I think he was the person
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:22.920]  he stood and he
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:24.920]  questioned the IRS
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:26.920]  and the way that individuals are being taxed
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:28.920]  and so on
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:30.920]  they tried to put him in president twice for his speech
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:32.920]  exactly
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:34.920]  and you know I recently
[2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:36.920]  turned to in desperation
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:38.920]  because I was a Canadian
[2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:40.920]  but we are close to you in every sense
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:42.920]  and to see
[2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:44.920]  that President Trump for instance
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:46.920]  he didn't even know
[2:04:46.920 --> 2:04:48.920]  who Georgie Schwartz is
[2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:50.920]  Georgie Schwartz
[2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:52.920]  is George Soros
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:54.920]  he's not even that's not even
[2:04:54.920 --> 2:04:56.920]  well thanks for calling
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:04:58.920]  Infowars
[2:04:58.920 --> 2:05:00.920]  there are so many crappy brands
[2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:02.920]  of energy products
[2:05:02.920 --> 2:05:04.920]  energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:06.920]  and look
[2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:08.920]  almost all of them work
[2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:10.920]  but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides
[2:05:10.920 --> 2:05:12.920]  horrible crashes
[2:05:12.920 --> 2:05:14.920]  and
[2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:16.920]  again so many toxins
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:18.920]  all of the new tropic products
[2:05:18.920 --> 2:05:20.920]  that we sell at infowarstore.com

[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:26.920]  this is going to be in studio coming up this segment
[2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:28.920]  but first
[2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:30.920]  a report on AOC and her attack
[2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:32.920]  on the first amendment
[2:06:32.920 --> 2:06:34.920]  the democratic process
[2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:36.920]  under Nancy Pelosi
[2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:38.920]  has become that of a dictatorship
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:40.920]  it's a cartoon, relax he said
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:42.920]  really?
[2:06:42.920 --> 2:06:44.920]  a cartoon? relax
[2:06:44.920 --> 2:06:46.920]  the speaker of the house stopped Americans from petitioning
[2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:48.920]  their member of congress to redress their agreements
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:50.920]  and wouldn't even let them in their own capital
[2:06:50.920 --> 2:06:52.920]  and now here we go again
[2:06:52.920 --> 2:06:54.920]  censoring speech
[2:06:54.920 --> 2:06:56.920]  the most fundamental liberty we have is our right to speak
[2:06:56.920 --> 2:06:58.920]  our right to talk
[2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:00.920]  our right to communicate
[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:02.920]  and they're going after that today
[2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:04.920]  because they don't like freedom
[2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:06.920]  for example as the face of the January 6th
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:08.920]  Patriot Trap
[2:07:08.920 --> 2:07:10.920]  Jacob Chansley is sentenced to three years
[2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:12.920]  and five months in order to strengthen
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:14.920]  the democrat's stranglehold
[2:07:14.920 --> 2:07:16.920]  on their politics of fear and victimization
[2:07:16.920 --> 2:07:18.920]  Jacob Chansley
[2:07:18.920 --> 2:07:20.920]  the self-proclaimed QAnon Shaman
[2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:22.920]  has been sentenced to 41 months
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:24.920]  in prison for his role
[2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:26.920]  in the January 6th Capitol riots
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:28.920]  he was seen entering the Senate chamber
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:30.920]  with a spear
[2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:32.920]  the House of Tyrants are now setting a new precedent
[2:07:32.920 --> 2:07:34.920]  stripping their opposition
[2:07:34.920 --> 2:07:36.920]  of their committee assignments over
[2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:38.920]  hypercriticism of an anime
[2:07:38.920 --> 2:07:40.920]  this is not about me
[2:07:40.920 --> 2:07:42.920]  this is not about representative
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:44.920]  Gosar
[2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:46.920]  but this is about what we are willing
[2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:48.920]  to accept
[2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:50.920]  my staff hosted a video depicting
[2:07:50.920 --> 2:07:52.920]  a policy battle regarding
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:54.920]  amnesty for tens of millions of
[2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:56.920]  allele aliens
[2:07:56.920 --> 2:07:58.920]  this is an anime that speaks to
[2:07:58.920 --> 2:08:00.920]  young voters who are too often overlooked
[2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:02.920]  even twitter
[2:08:02.920 --> 2:08:04.920]  the left's mouthpiece did not remove
[2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:06.920]  the cartoon noting
[2:08:06.920 --> 2:08:08.920]  it was in the public interest for it to remain
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:10.920]  democrat policies
[2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:12.920]  are so pathetic and have done so
[2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:14.920]  poorly that the left has nothing else to do
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:16.920]  but troll the internet looking for ways
[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:18.920]  to get offended
[2:08:18.920 --> 2:08:20.920]  and then try to target members
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:22.920]  and strip them of their committees
[2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:24.920]  now this nihilism
[2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:26.920]  runs
[2:08:26.920 --> 2:08:28.920]  deep
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:30.920]  and it conveys
[2:08:30.920 --> 2:08:32.920]  and betrays
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:34.920]  a certain content
[2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:36.920]  for the meaning and importance
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:38.920]  of our work here
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:40.920]  these depictions are part
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:42.920]  of a larger trend
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:44.920]  of misogyny
[2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:46.920]  and racial misogyny
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:48.920]  racist misogyny
[2:08:48.920 --> 2:08:50.920]  meanwhile the democrats ignore
[2:08:50.920 --> 2:08:52.920]  their own violent rhetoric that incited
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:54.920]  billions of property damage
[2:08:54.920 --> 2:08:56.920]  and at least two dozen deaths
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:08:58.920]  any move that almost perfectly embodies
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:00.920]  the absurdity of our current political
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:02.920]  moment congresswoman alexandria
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:04.920]  casio-cortez came out in favor
[2:09:04.920 --> 2:09:06.920]  of the riot that trace
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:08.920]  just described punch a cop
[2:09:08.920 --> 2:09:10.920]  we are not safe
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:12.920]  with people
[2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:14.920]  who hold positions of power
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:16.920]  who are willing to
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:18.920]  endanger the lives
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:20.920]  of others
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:22.920]  if they think it will score them a political point
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:24.920]  bang, bang, bang
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:26.920]  and then I just start to hear
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:28.920]  these yells of
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:30.920]  where is she
[2:09:30.920 --> 2:09:32.920]  where is she
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:34.920]  now she was claiming
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:36.920]  that they were banging on the door
[2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:38.920]  where is she
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:40.920]  they were screaming loudly in the halls
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:42.920]  I would imagine if you were there
[2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:44.920]  at the time did you see and hear that
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:46.920]  we have to separate fact from fiction
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:48.920]  and the facts are
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:50.920]  there was no violent mob in the hallways
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:52.920]  the folks who were there to riot
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:54.920]  weren't in the canon office building
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:56.920]  and so we have to be very clear
[2:09:56.920 --> 2:09:58.920]  and not exaggerate this experience
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:00.920]  or take advantage of it
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:02.920]  and politicize it in any way shape or form
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:04.920]  Arizona Republican representative
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:06.920]  Paul Gosar posted this video
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:08.920]  to twitter the video depicts
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:10.920]  Gosar as the hero
[2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:12.920]  of the attack on Titan anime
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:14.920]  defeating the oppressive Alexandria
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:16.920]  Ocasio-Cortez
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:18.920]  and Joe Biden leave it to the victimization
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:20.920]  mindset of the democrats
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:22.920]  to wield tyranny in the form of
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:24.920]  censure to further destroy
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:26.920]  freedom of expression
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:28.920]  and accelerate the characterization of the GOP
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:30.920]  as white supremacists
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:32.920]  and misogynists
[2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:34.920]  if the democrats truly had their way
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  they would imprison anyone
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:38.920]  and everyone they deem inferior
[2:10:38.920 --> 2:10:40.920]  to their lunacy
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:42.920]  John Bown reporting
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:48.920]  well it's a historic time to be alive
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:50.920]  I'm Alex Jones your host Mike Cernovich
[2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:52.920]  is with us for the next hour
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:54.920]  and 45 minutes or so on air
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:56.920]  that we have left in the broadcast
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:10:58.920]  on this amazing Friday
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:00.920]  transmission it's great to have Mike Cernovich here
[2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:02.920]  it's been great to have Tim Poole here
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:04.920]  yesterday as well
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:06.920]  that is quite the transmission
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:08.920]  it was wonderful to be on the show
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:10.920]  with Joe Rogan just a few days ago
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:12.920]  and people are really getting awake
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:14.920]  I wanted to play the verdict again
[2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:16.920]  for everybody and we'll do that
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:18.920]  coming up here in just a few minutes
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:20.920]  but what I really want to see is the prosecutor
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:22.920]  and we're looking for any other footage
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:24.920]  but it looks like there was one pool camera
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:26.920]  and it was not on the prosecutor
[2:11:26.920 --> 2:11:28.920]  but I would love to see the look on his face
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:30.920]  but there's going to be repercussions from this
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  so what's your big takeaway from this
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:34.920]  Mike Cernovich who's also a lawyer
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:36.920]  not just an award-winning filmmaker
[2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:38.920]  yeah what's going to come next
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:40.920]  and I'm telling people is remain vigilant
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:42.920]  they're going to need scapegoats
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:44.920]  they're going to need new victims
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:46.920]  Garland and the enemies of goodness
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:48.920]  the enemy of the children
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:50.920]  the evil people the dark worshipers
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:52.920]  the death worshipers
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:54.920]  they want revenge
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:56.920]  so people are celebrating
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:11:58.920]  and in my own mind I'm thinking
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:00.920]  why are we celebrating
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:02.920]  should have been prosecuted
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:04.920]  why are we celebrating an underage boy was lynched
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:06.920]  why are we celebrating the corporate media
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:08.920]  the democrat establishment
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:10.920]  Joe Biden himself defended a convicted pedophile
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  let's just talk about what happened
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.920]  and why I'm not freaking celebrating
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:16.920]  I'm sorry I don't mean to cuss
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:18.920]  let's talk about what really happened
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:20.920]  an underage boy was almost murdered
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:22.920]  by a serial pedophile
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:24.920]  a serial child rapist
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:26.920]  almost murdered an underage boy
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:28.920]  everyone from Joe Biden to CNN
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:30.920]  the Russian Post the New York Times
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:32.920]  the MSNBC defended a convicted pedophile
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:34.920]  and joined a lynch mob
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:36.920]  against a 17 year old boy
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:38.920]  so I'm not celebrating I'm not happy with what happened today
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:40.920]  I feel contempt
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:42.920]  bile
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:44.920]  indignation
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:46.920]  rage
[2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:48.920]  disgust that I live in a filthy society
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:50.920]  where people are defending pedophiles
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:52.920]  including Joe Biden
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:54.920]  so what Kyle Rittenhouse went through
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:56.920]  was horrific
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:12:58.920]  lynched the only reason he wasn't convicted
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:00.920]  we now know that prosecutors all lie
[2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:02.920]  nothing happens the only reason he wasn't convicted
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:04.920]  is because
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:06.920]  a few streamers some free beacon
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:08.920]  the daily caller were there and they got that footage
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:10.920]  otherwise
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:12.920]  there would be no footage clearly
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:14.920]  vindicating Kyle Rittenhouse
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:16.920]  so he was almost lynched this is the precipice
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:18.920]  that we're on we're on the precipice
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:20.920]  of full on communist
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:22.920]  revolution
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:24.920]  where they begin lynching people they lynched them
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:26.920]  they were stopped from lynching him
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:28.920]  because they were not powerful enough to do it
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:30.920]  GoFundMe lynched him
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:32.920]  Facebook lynched him they banned anybody who spoke the truth
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:34.920]  which anyone who watched the videos had seen
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:36.920]  would know to be true
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:38.920]  we got debanked for the third time
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:40.920]  and they told us it was over supporting Rittenhouse
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:42.920]  and having his mom on
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:44.920]  yes I'm furious I'm not
[2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:46.920]  no I hear you we're vindicated this was a fraud
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:48.920]  it should have never happened you're right
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:50.920]  I couldn't help have a dopamine rush though that he's not going to prison
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:52.920]  yeah I feel good for him
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:54.920]  but I'm outraged
[2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:56.920]  that I had to watch everyone
[2:13:56.920 --> 2:13:58.920]  from the commander in chief
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:00.920]  of this country's military
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:02.920]  to every corporate media outlet
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:04.920]  to every left wing pundit
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:06.920]  to Facebook to GoFundMe
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:08.920]  to every social media outlet defend
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:10.920]  a serial pat-a-fall it was about choosing a side
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:12.920]  and they
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:14.920]  and like you said yesterday they actually had a bunch of signs out showing him as a
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:16.920]  as a superhero and as a saint
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:18.920]  right so I'm not
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:20.920]  I'm not happy with what happened today
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:22.920]  I don't feel good about what happened today
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:24.920]  I look at it as the bullet
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:26.920]  whizzed right by his head
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:28.920]  grazed him he has a gassing wound
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:30.920]  and they're still going to try to kill him
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:32.920]  they're still you think they're going to end this
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:34.920]  but what I am grateful for
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:36.920]  and I feel very selfish
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.920]  saying this I feel selfish
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:40.920]  saying this but I'm
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:42.920]  grateful that
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:44.920]  this was shown
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:46.920]  the system was shown for what it was
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:48.920]  that the system was evil what they did
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:50.920]  to him was evil it wasn't a
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:52.920]  reasonable minds could disagree
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:54.920]  it wasn't maybe he was wrong
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:56.920]  maybe he was right
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:14:58.920]  it was a full lynch
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:00.920]  and that's what the whole system ganged up on him
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:02.920]  the courts the media
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:04.920]  the Democratic
[2:15:04.920 --> 2:15:06.920]  party the Justice Department
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:08.920]  world leaders
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:10.920]  but then I guess he did have one good
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:12.920]  fair judge yeah and a boomer
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:14.920]  70 year old boomer so God bless the boomers
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:16.920]  today we like to I like to
[2:15:16.920 --> 2:15:18.920]  criticize the boomers a little bit but that's the last
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:20.920]  of the Mohicans what happens when
[2:15:20.920 --> 2:15:22.920]  binger becomes a judge
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:24.920]  this is what's happening and I can tell you as a lawyer
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:26.920]  all of the judges who truly
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:28.920]  believe in civil liberties
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:30.920]  and truly believe in the Constitution in the American
[2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:32.920]  way they're all getting old they're all
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:34.920]  retiring we're going to have a bunch of woke
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:36.920]  judges like ADA binger because the pipeline
[2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:38.920]  to a judge is prosecutor I
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:40.920]  experienced that in my family court case I had
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:42.920]  this judge it was great and then she retired
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:44.920]  and then all these new ones literally finance basauros
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:46.920]  came in and they like laugh at you
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:48.920]  and literally just like cackle like witches
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:50.920]  right so we're
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:52.920]  two three four years away from
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:54.920]  written house would have been convicted
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:56.920]  by the judge right there
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:15:58.920]  I know you're humble I know
[2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:00.920]  you're like me but I really
[2:16:00.920 --> 2:16:02.920]  want you to sit back and
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:04.920]  caudate or meditate
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:06.920]  on the fact that
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:08.920]  those of you that have supported
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:10.920]  my broadcast and info wars over the years

[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:14.920]  ways and now as
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:16.920]  2021
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:18.920]  prepares to end in 2022
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:20.920]  begins to dawn it is more
[2:16:20.920 --> 2:16:22.920]  important than ever that you realize

[2:16:46.920 --> 2:16:48.920]  right now we've got turbo force
[2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:50.920]  sold out for months 10 hours clean energy
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:52.920]  back and stop the free shipping 40%
[2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:54.920]  off and so many other great
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:56.920]  products
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:16:58.920]  it's only been
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:00.920]  in the last 60 years that we've had
[2:17:00.920 --> 2:17:02.920]  satellites that can decently
[2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:04.920]  measure what's happening in the
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:06.920]  atmosphere but if you look at all the
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:08.920]  different studies reports about my NASA
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:10.920]  government's other agencies
[2:17:10.920 --> 2:17:12.920]  they all disagree on what's really happening
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:14.920]  with the climate the only constant
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:16.920]  the only great truth is change
[2:17:16.920 --> 2:17:18.920]  is the only constant
[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:20.920]  so yes climate change is
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:22.920]  totally real but notice first they called
[2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:24.920]  it global freezing back in the 70s
[2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:26.920]  80s and then it's gonna be global warming
[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:28.920]  and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:30.920]  okay now it's just climate change
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:32.920]  but did you know that manmade climate change
[2:17:32.920 --> 2:17:34.920]  is a real thing
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:36.920]  when it comes to the united nations
[2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:38.920]  and the department of energy
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:40.920]  and bill gates and the UN they have
[2:17:40.920 --> 2:17:42.920]  weather control trees from 1979
[2:17:42.920 --> 2:17:44.920]  bill gates has been manipulating
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:46.920]  the weather for a very long time
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:48.920]  in fact back in 1994 two scientists
[2:17:48.920 --> 2:17:50.920]  wanted a Nobel prize for an idea of spring
[2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:52.920]  different particles out of jet engines
[2:17:52.920 --> 2:17:54.920]  to control the weather so yes manmade
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:56.920]  climate change is real
[2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:00.920]  if you only knew
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:02.920]  the power of the dark side
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:04.920]  join bill gates
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:06.920]  and together
[2:18:06.920 --> 2:18:08.920]  we will defeat humanity
[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:12.920]  then our gods
[2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:14.920]  will reward us with eternal life
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:18.920]  that's basically the ethos
[2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:20.920]  of the globalists
[2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:22.920]  they must first play god
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:24.920]  they must first
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:26.920]  prove that they are the fittest
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:28.920]  in their social Darwinistic system
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:30.920]  and in a way they're right
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:32.920]  if we let them lie to us
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:34.920]  and dump us down and poison us
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:36.920]  destroy our children's futures
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:38.920]  the evidence is overwhelming
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:40.920]  and out in the open we really deserve
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:42.920]  what's happened to us
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:44.920]  so I ask you now
[2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:46.920]  are you going to step up
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:48.920]  and expose the new order even more
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:50.920]  I know I'm pledging to step up
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:52.920]  and redouble my efforts
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:54.920]  the front lines of the fight is infowars.com
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:18:58.920]  why do my enemies hate me so much
[2:18:58.920 --> 2:19:00.920]  why do the globalists take you so much
[2:19:00.920 --> 2:19:02.920]  they hate America so much
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:04.920]  because it's an idea
[2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:06.920]  of freedom that their tyrannical
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:08.920]  system that they're pushing
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:10.920]  cannot coexist with
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:12.920]  it's very very simple for their world government
[2:19:12.920 --> 2:19:14.920]  their anti-human
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:16.920]  post-human eugenics system
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:18.920]  to flourish
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:20.920]  freedom and liberty and new process
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:22.920]  injustice and god fearing systems
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:24.920]  must fail
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:26.920]  so sure you didn't start a fight with bill gates
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:28.920]  you didn't start a fight with
[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.920]  David Rockefeller
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:32.920]  you didn't start a fight with the UN
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:34.920]  they started a fight with you
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:36.920]  and they're not going to back down
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:38.920]  and they're not going to go away
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:40.920]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:42.920]  until they have the fear of god
[2:19:42.920 --> 2:19:44.920]  put into them
[2:19:44.920 --> 2:19:46.920]  the average person still doesn't even know about the new world order
[2:19:46.920 --> 2:19:48.920]  or about globalism
[2:19:48.920 --> 2:19:50.920]  or about corporate fascism
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:52.920]  and it's not until people understand that
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:54.920]  and that we're under attack that we have any chance
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:58.920]  in these people
[2:19:58.920 --> 2:20:26.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:42.920]  music
[2:20:42.920 --> 2:20:44.920]  well if you're a tv viewer
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:46.920]  we've got one of the women
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:48.920]  that says that the three men that were shot
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:50.920]  two of them died are heroes
[2:20:50.920 --> 2:20:52.920]  and you were talking about this worship of pedophiles
[2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:54.920]  my experience being at the heart of their whole operation
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:20:56.920]  let's put that kooky lady back up there
[2:20:56.920 --> 2:20:58.920]  you were just talking about this
[2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:00.920]  before they even put the image up on the screen during the break
[2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:02.920]  about worshiping pedophiles
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:04.920]  what's going on with this
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:06.920]  they can no longer deny
[2:21:06.920 --> 2:21:08.920]  that the left worships
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:10.920]  pedophiles because
[2:21:10.920 --> 2:21:12.920]  they're defending someone who was a serial child
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:14.920]  rapist
[2:21:14.920 --> 2:21:16.920]  let's just talk about this
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:18.920]  we'll call written house
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:20.920]  shouldn't have been out there that night
[2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:22.920]  with an assault rifle
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:24.920]  or whatever you want to call it
[2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:26.920]  and my response to that is
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:28.920]  well should a convicted pedophile
[2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:30.920]  have been out there
[2:21:30.920 --> 2:21:32.920]  should a domestic abuser
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:34.920]  have been out there
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:36.920]  the criminal records of the three men
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:38.920]  who attacked written house are so long
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:40.920]  that I can't even keep track
[2:21:40.920 --> 2:21:42.920]  so if you want to claim that Carl written house
[2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:44.920]  who by the way was the victim
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:46.920]  should not have been out there
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:48.920]  then before when I thought the left could be saved
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:50.920]  and that's why I made hoax to really
[2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:52.920]  still naively believed
[2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:54.920]  that we could save some democrats
[2:21:54.920 --> 2:21:56.920]  and they still had some pureness to their heart
[2:21:56.920 --> 2:21:58.920]  and that we could find common ground
[2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:00.920]  I don't share common ground with pedophile supporters
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:02.920]  how is the left it seems gotten so much more radical
[2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:04.920]  and they're all over the news now
[2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:06.920]  they're all over twitter
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:08.920]  professors saying pedophilia is good
[2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:10.920]  it's everywhere
[2:22:10.920 --> 2:22:12.920]  and like de Blasio
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:14.920]  is defending them
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:16.920]  saying they were good people
[2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:18.920]  they call a minor attracted persons now
[2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:20.920]  there was a professor who
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:22.920]  she he they
[2:22:22.920 --> 2:22:24.920]  whatever their pronouns they want to use
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:26.920]  whatever pronouns they want to use
[2:22:26.920 --> 2:22:28.920]  I don't even care about that I'm more concerned
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:30.920]  with the nefarious messaging
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:32.920]  and I used to believe that
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:34.920]  we had common ground
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:36.920]  but there's no common ground with pedophiles
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:38.920]  right you can't have common ground with them
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:40.920]  so everyone who is saying
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:42.920]  if somebody for example
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:44.920]  here's an old school leftist would say
[2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:46.920]  an old school leftist would say
[2:22:46.920 --> 2:22:48.920]  a written house should not have been out there that night
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:50.920]  but that pedophile
[2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:52.920]  who attacked him should be in prison for life
[2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:54.920]  as a serial pedophile
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:22:56.920]  so this shows that this country is broken down
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:22:58.920]  no one wants to say that
[2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:00.920]  right everybody wants to say that
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:02.920]  we'll call written house should not have been out
[2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:04.920]  why not why shouldn't he have been out there
[2:23:04.920 --> 2:23:06.920]  why should he have not been out there first of all
[2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:08.920]  but even accepting that is true
[2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:10.920]  why should a
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:12.920]  why did this that gay guy have a firearm
[2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:14.920]  was he an authorized user of firearm
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:16.920]  was he allowed to legally own a firearm
[2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:18.920]  and to brandish a firearm
[2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:20.920]  and to point a firearm at a 17 year old
[2:23:20.920 --> 2:23:22.920]  what about how the FBI had overhead flare footage
[2:23:22.920 --> 2:23:24.920]  and ground footage knowing that
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:26.920]  written house is getting shot at and they suppressed that
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:28.920]  and then MSNBC again wouldn't show any of the defense
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:30.920]  only show the prosecution
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:32.920]  like you said this is a high tech lynching
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:34.920]  of the power structure
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:36.920]  defending mobs
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:38.920]  and the beauty of it and again
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:40.920]  we often find beauty and tragedy
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:42.920]  and what had happened to written house
[2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:44.920]  is he's going to have a lot of trauma
[2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:46.920]  is he's going to really struggle with this
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:48.920]  imagine that you were thrust into combat
[2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:50.920]  a combat situation
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:52.920]  and the way that he was and the healing that he's going to have to go through
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:54.920]  and deal with that process
[2:23:54.920 --> 2:23:56.920]  the beauty of this tragedy
[2:23:56.920 --> 2:23:58.920]  was that
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:00.920]  you can no longer claim
[2:24:00.920 --> 2:24:02.920]  oh we're in it together
[2:24:02.920 --> 2:24:04.920]  right might be criticism of trump is that he's kind of a wimp
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:06.920]  that he's a fraud
[2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:08.920]  and he didn't have the character to do what needed to be done
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:10.920]  and purge the FBI
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:12.920]  of the evil to purge the generals
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:14.920]  the woke weak generals
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:16.920]  the general millies
[2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:18.920]  I just think trump didn't realize how corrupt it was
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:20.920]  he said that I'm not trying to overly defend trump
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:22.920]  but he was a lot better than what we got now
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:24.920]  well the people now coming up though
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:26.920]  realize that were I mean even
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:28.920]  McCarthy who I don't think should be
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:30.920]  speaker McCarthy was going off on these people
[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:32.920]  you finally there's more clarity
[2:24:32.920 --> 2:24:34.920]  right that's what I tell people
[2:24:34.920 --> 2:24:36.920]  when I counsel people
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:38.920]  and help them through their own
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:40.920]  processes and thought processes
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:42.920]  I always say one benefit
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:44.920]  of trauma is moral clarity
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:46.920]  and moral clarity is beautiful
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:48.920]  it's wrong to feel betrayed
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:50.920]  it's wrong to have
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  unfocused mind unfocused emotions
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:54.920]  and we now have moral clarity
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:56.920]  it's good versus evil
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  this is not we have Mayor
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:00.920]  Bill de Blasio saying that
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  this isn't over he wants to incite
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:04.920]  violence against written house
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:06.920]  he's tweeting out an open call
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:08.920]  for violence right
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:10.920]  he's making open calls
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:12.920]  for violence open incitements of violence
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:14.920]  from again a New York mayor
[2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:16.920]  and by the way if people are looking at that subway
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:18.920]  footage I would like to
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:20.920]  pitch and hold that to something that comes up where a lot of people get angry at me
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:22.920]  in New York
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:24.920]  there's footage is and this happened in Philadelphia
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:26.920]  two where women are getting beat up
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:28.920]  a lot in New York and then
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:30.920]  conservative men go well if I were there
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:32.920]  I'm a manly man and if I were there
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:34.920]  if you were there okay you'd end up like written house
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:36.920]  but defend a liberal
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:38.920]  smart
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:40.920]  Bill de Blasio saying that if you intervene
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:42.920]  on a bus in New York
[2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:44.920]  you're going to get lynched like written house
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:46.920]  great job manly man conservative
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:48.920]  when are these people going to wake up
[2:25:48.920 --> 2:25:50.920]  and get rid of this white knight
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:52.920]  cock mindset where they don't realize
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:54.920]  90% chance
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:56.920]  the people hurting each other
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:25:58.920]  voted for it but you're
[2:25:58.920 --> 2:26:00.920]  I'm a manly man conservative and I'm going to go in there
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:02.920]  and you end up like Kyle written house
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:04.920]  in New York now you have a New York judge
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  you have a New York jury and good luck
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:08.920]  raising $250,000 for your criminal
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:10.920]  offense all for what
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:12.920]  for what that's another question
[2:26:12.920 --> 2:26:14.920]  I'm going to play the verdict and also take some calls that you're taking
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:16.920]  what they have to say here
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:18.920]  with Mike Cernovich on the Alex Jones show
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:20.920]  how long can
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:22.920]  New York in places like that not totally
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:24.920]  collapse I mean like Los Angeles because
[2:26:24.920 --> 2:26:26.920]  it's just the
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:28.920]  insanity is a feedback loop
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:30.920]  and they're getting crazier and crazier
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:32.920]  right that's sort of our business
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:34.920]  the answer to that is if you're a God
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:36.920]  fearing Christian if you're
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:38.920]  conservative what they want
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:40.920]  to do if they want to live in filth
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:42.920]  if they want to know that if you're on the subway
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:44.920]  you might get beat up you might get mugged
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  you might get killed on this that's none of our business
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:48.920]  it's not my business what happens in San Francisco
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:50.920]  New York LA I don't go there anymore
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:52.920]  right occasionally I have to drive through
[2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:54.920]  LA to get somewhere and I know that
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:56.920]  I'm on high alert that
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:26:58.920]  at any moment you're in a war zone
[2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:05.840]  I was for example went to a wedding my wife and I are driving down the highway. We hear gunshots. It literally is a war zone
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:09.320]  It's not a hyperbolic statement to call it a war zone
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:12.560]  So me Austin's a war zone in many areas now
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:17.520]  And that's hopefully you guys can handle that because you were here before they came here
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:22.400]  So in my view you have there's a moral obligation to do something here
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:26.560]  It's true like I don't they're black or white or Hispanic, but it's like a zombie class
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:32.760]  It is just boiling out everywhere and what mostly that's the thing about the racial thing well
[2:27:32.760 --> 2:27:37.560]  Well, what did it? What did it? What happened to these people that's what frustrates me as some people go
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:40.880]  Oh, you're making a dog whistle for race for LA. They're all white
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:47.040]  They're all all these white home. They're junkies. They're all white homeless junkies. I guess it's letting China ship in the fentanyl
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:51.480]  Previously we had massive fentanyl now. It's doubled under Biden. It's all the numbers today
[2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:58.720]  Doubling of the previous fentanyl overdoses. I saw a hundred thousand is the first time that there's been a hundred thousand overdose deaths in
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:06.680]  History is what I saw and the numbers are so huge that I have to triple check it and make sure that's a reliable over a hundred thousand people dying
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:09.400]  So my answer to that is if you are a
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:13.480]  Conservative if you believe in goodness if you don't take the side of people who defend paddle falls
[2:28:13.800 --> 2:28:15.200]  Whatever happens in New York
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:20.880]  Mind your own business if you're there because you have work or your tourist and there's something happened on a train
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:26.380]  You're gonna intervene when mayor mayor to build a Blasio comes out in favor of lynching underage people get it together
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:29.720]  Conservice quit get this crap out of your mind
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:37.560]  Where you have captain save a rotten society complex where the people who hate you you need to side and defend and support the people
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:41.360]  Who are on your side and if they you're not blaming written house for going to finish dad
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:44.540]  I'm not blaming but if you were my son, I would say
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:48.520]  Get your dad over here if you were my son, you know what I would have told them
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:51.960]  I would say we live in a rotten corrupt society
[2:28:52.280 --> 2:29:00.040]  You need to just get your mind on all we're gonna break if you're concerned about the there are so many crappy brands of
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:06.560]  Energy products energy drinks energy powders energy pills and look almost all of them work
[2:29:06.880 --> 2:29:09.600]  But they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides
[2:29:10.440 --> 2:29:12.440]  horrible crashes and
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:20.880]  Again so many toxins out all of the new tropic products that we sell at info or store comm are clean
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:27.120]  Are pure or highest quality and they're long-lasting and they help focus your mind and
[2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:30.840]  Right now our strongest product the three news robics. We have
[2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:34.200]  Rain force plus rain force ultra and
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:37.560]  Turbo force are
[2:29:37.560 --> 2:29:43.720]  Back in stock at info or store comm turbo force has been sold out for more than six months
[2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:51.080]  It's back in stock with free shipping 40% off. It is 10 hours of clean energy
[2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:57.080]  Clean energy without the big crash and it's available right now and it funds the info war a 360 win
[2:29:57.080 --> 2:30:00.560]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:07.160]  There's a war between free individuals and nation-states on one side and the globalist on the other
[2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:14.400]  Who are literally trying to create a post human world for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the Brexit the UK?
[2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:20.880]  Nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government. That's why they launched their great reset
[2:30:21.040 --> 2:30:24.960]  And their program after collapsing us of build back better
[2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:27.800]  This is nothing more than a top-down
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:29.800]  Vertical
[2:30:29.880 --> 2:30:35.560]  Consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:39.020]  Which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win
[2:30:39.640 --> 2:30:46.600]  They released a biological weapon on us now. We know two years ago. We learned about it about 20 months ago
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:50.280]  It's that simple they can't be because of our free speech and our guns
[2:30:50.680 --> 2:30:56.720]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history expose this paradigm and we win
[2:30:56.720 --> 2:30:59.440]  I know you're humble. I know you're like me
[2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:01.960]  but I really want you to sit back and
[2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:04.800]  cogitate or meditate on
[2:31:05.280 --> 2:31:06.640]  the fact that
[2:31:06.640 --> 2:31:13.920]  Those of you that have supported my broadcast and info wars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways and now as
[2:31:14.960 --> 2:31:16.320]  2021
[2:31:16.320 --> 2:31:18.320]  prepares the end at 2022
[2:31:19.040 --> 2:31:26.280]  Begins to dawn it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are that you be more active than you've ever been

[2:31:56.840 --> 2:31:59.600]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming
[2:31:59.600 --> 2:32:04.800]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany
[2:32:04.800 --> 2:32:10.680]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:18.480]  Taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:23.640]  Process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety
[2:32:23.640 --> 2:32:28.460]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality
[2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:35.160]  Faraday cages many of which are made here in America and are very compliant meaning us government military grade at

[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:02.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:02.860 --> 2:33:13.260]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war
[2:33:13.260 --> 2:33:17.260]  For your mind
[2:33:29.180 --> 2:33:32.620]  Yes, sir, that looks good, you know, I rarely smoke cigars
[2:33:32.620 --> 2:33:37.860]  But I don't like service has always got nice ones and we tried to meet in Phoenix and smoke one
[2:33:37.860 --> 2:33:44.660]  Back during the very first days of the contested election and we had a leftist start a fight with us
[2:33:44.660 --> 2:33:47.860]  And one assertive is of friends who was a
[2:33:48.700 --> 2:33:53.740]  Professional boxer so it was a quite famous one actually we also had it. I'm one of my
[2:33:54.700 --> 2:34:01.460]  UFC former champion was one of my bodyguards and this leftist looked like a big giant fat version
[2:34:01.860 --> 2:34:06.420]  of Rosenbaum seriously kept starting fights and then the
[2:34:06.420 --> 2:34:11.220]  People that I guess own the place like yeah, maybe you should leave they kind of agreed with it
[2:34:11.220 --> 2:34:12.740]  And that goes to what you're saying good
[2:34:12.740 --> 2:34:18.260]  Put a sign up saying you like pedophilia put a sign up saying you like world government put a sign up saying you like open
[2:34:18.260 --> 2:34:20.260]  Borders put a sign up you're against self-defense
[2:34:20.380 --> 2:34:23.900]  So we won't come in your stinking store instead the left won't do that
[2:34:23.900 --> 2:34:28.940]  But they're always trying to suppress us and debank us and de-platform us and I'm sick of these bullies
[2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:33.980]  Yeah, so I was gonna talk about that would bring a couple cigars. We got there
[2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:40.500]  Everybody was excited. We're sitting down to hang out. There was this meathead and I don't he was like a big meatball
[2:34:40.500 --> 2:34:44.860]  He's one of those guys who did too much trend, but didn't ever diet
[2:34:44.900 --> 2:34:48.300]  So he's a big blockhead meathead who thinks he plays in the FL
[2:34:48.300 --> 2:34:49.900]  He didn't have that big fat
[2:34:49.900 --> 2:34:52.660]  Neck roll on his head and right when I was in there
[2:34:52.660 --> 2:34:57.740]  I said this guy's gonna be trouble because he was sitting there in the back and I could tell he was a very angry person
[2:34:57.900 --> 2:35:01.100]  And as we're sitting there he looked like a giant version of Rosenbaum
[2:35:01.100 --> 2:35:04.260]  Yeah, he was a meat meat. He's a meatball looked like a meatball, but he went to the gym
[2:35:04.260 --> 2:35:10.500]  So he had that I can barely move around. I'm such a big guy. No, you just don't like to you like to eat too much
[2:35:10.500 --> 2:35:11.500]  right see
[2:35:11.500 --> 2:35:15.060]  ball and I knew that there was gonna be a bad vibe
[2:35:15.060 --> 2:35:17.860]  So I sit there and I look and he's back in the corner like this
[2:35:18.980 --> 2:35:22.980]  You know like a demon. Yeah, and then we're just talking normal and he goes
[2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:28.380]  Meet me ball goes. I pay more the taxes than anybody in here and
[2:35:28.380 --> 2:35:33.340]  Announce turns and he's like, okay, man, you know, that's cool. We're all just be cool, man
[2:35:33.460 --> 2:35:38.540]  He goes, well, I pay more taxes than anyone in here and okay, man. Be cool. Be cool, right?
[2:35:38.540 --> 2:35:41.980]  We don't care good for you, right? I said congratulations. I'm glad you're successful
[2:35:42.900 --> 2:35:48.420]  Completely about deescalating the situation as crazy as we've got a bunch of killers with us. Yeah, this guy's an idiot
[2:35:48.420 --> 2:35:51.620]  Well, that's why I deescalate because I don't want to end up like written house
[2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:54.700]  I know what would have happened to this guy and in my own mind
[2:35:54.700 --> 2:36:00.060]  I was I was moved to deescalation. What I what I always tell people is that you
[2:36:00.860 --> 2:36:02.260]  should never
[2:36:02.260 --> 2:36:04.660]  Be rude to people in real life
[2:36:04.980 --> 2:36:09.780]  But you should be able to handle business if it arises the meatball then gets up
[2:36:09.780 --> 2:36:14.260]  Oh, and you hear all these chairs moving around like showdown. Okay, Corral
[2:36:14.900 --> 2:36:18.700]  our guys are standing up and I'm thinking we got to get out of here man because
[2:36:18.700 --> 2:36:26.900]  Meatball is completely unstable meatballs about to get hurt really badly and then we'll get framed of course because that's what happens
[2:36:26.900 --> 2:36:30.820]  They frame us the word just sitting there trying to have a cigar you about to order dinner
[2:36:31.380 --> 2:36:36.060]  We're here with we were with the great Amanda Milius. She had made the plotting is the president movie
[2:36:36.220 --> 2:36:39.140]  But we're all there good vibes. Everybody's chill
[2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:44.260]  But I know in the back of my head this meatball guy is the aggressor
[2:36:44.260 --> 2:36:48.900]  Legally, we would be in the right, but we're gonna get framed for this anyway
[2:36:48.900 --> 2:36:52.700]  And then the owner said well, maybe you people should just close out your tab
[2:36:52.700 --> 2:36:53.980]  And he kept starting fights
[2:36:53.980 --> 2:36:58.380]  He kept getting on our face threatening to kick our ass over and over and I'm like sir, it's okay
[2:36:58.620 --> 2:37:00.620]  And he just kept like a demon laughing
[2:37:01.900 --> 2:37:07.380]  He was it was crazy. Yeah, meatball was out of his mind. It was it was really somebody who wanted
[2:37:08.060 --> 2:37:09.420]  conflict and
[2:37:09.420 --> 2:37:15.900]  He had no idea it was one of those weird situations where there's like that biker scene in a Bronx
[2:37:15.900 --> 2:37:17.900]  Tale where the bikers go in to bust up the joint
[2:37:17.940 --> 2:37:22.980]  They have no idea what situation they got himself and that's what I thought this meathead is
[2:37:23.780 --> 2:37:28.340]  You have no idea. There's five people here that on their worst day
[2:37:28.340 --> 2:37:33.980]  But I think you come in we had armed, you know security people being very nice and then one of the security guys
[2:37:33.980 --> 2:37:37.940]  He's actually friends with Joe Rogan. He's a famous UFC guy. He's also on the police department Phoenix
[2:37:37.940 --> 2:37:40.420]  He wanted to come out be with security and then there was a
[2:37:40.900 --> 2:37:45.020]  Well-known former professional boxer that was a fan that was there who he kept starting a fight with that guy
[2:37:45.020 --> 2:37:47.860]  Yeah, and it's like with a heavyweight boxer and I'm just like this that's crazy
[2:37:47.860 --> 2:37:52.180]  He couldn't have found a meaner group to mess with I know but we're the most friendly people in the world
[2:37:52.180 --> 2:37:56.820]  We have to be wise like serpents gentle like doves and that's my pro
[2:37:56.820 --> 2:38:00.180]  I always say what do you think his goal was his goal in his assbeat
[2:38:00.180 --> 2:38:06.820]  Well, he was an angry human being and he wanted to find an outlet for his rage and in his own mind
[2:38:06.820 --> 2:38:11.020]  He thinks that well, I'm I go to the gym and I you know
[2:38:11.020 --> 2:38:15.860]  I bench-press 315 pounds so I can beat these guys up and you're like yeah a lot of guys
[2:38:16.100 --> 2:38:19.260]  That night it bench-press 315 like you're not in his mind
[2:38:19.260 --> 2:38:22.660]  They're called like a gym hero so what and I'm very pro gym
[2:38:22.660 --> 2:38:29.580]  So I'm if I'm saying this that tells you how whack the guy was where they never really did any real sports
[2:38:29.580 --> 2:38:30.860]  They never did anything athletic
[2:38:30.860 --> 2:38:36.140]  They get a little bit of muscle mass on them and then in some case they become meatballs because they keep eating because they
[2:38:36.140 --> 2:38:41.900]  Read on a power lifting message board that having a 50-inch gut helps with them have a better squat leverages on squats
[2:38:41.900 --> 2:38:46.740]  And then they think that they're a threat right and they don't realize that
[2:38:47.860 --> 2:38:50.980]  You know meatball would be gassed in eight seconds on the ground
[2:38:50.980 --> 2:38:54.980]  But is it that an example of the left in general like they've already got control
[2:38:54.980 --> 2:38:59.940]  Why are they pushing and messing with us and starting fights and bullying constantly? Yeah, there he is
[2:38:59.940 --> 2:39:06.580]  Yeah, well, it's because the leftist aesthetic is always nihilistic the left doesn't have a theory of a
[2:39:07.140 --> 2:39:14.140]  Aesthetics they don't have a theory of beauty and what I've learned is that all politics are now aesthetic where you could look now
[2:39:14.340 --> 2:39:20.420]  And say okay those people that's a leftist that person is a right-wing person that person's left
[2:39:20.420 --> 2:39:24.860]  Well, it is true that that that black right-wingers white right-wingers
[2:39:26.100 --> 2:39:27.340]  Hispanic left
[2:39:27.340 --> 2:39:31.380]  Right-wingers look handsome and and healthy and then the left look like ghouls
[2:39:31.940 --> 2:39:38.420]  Well aesthetics that's the whole point is the the left is fundamentally caught up in post-structuralism
[2:39:39.420 --> 2:39:44.780]  Deconstructionalism nihilism they don't have a theory of aesthetics everything is about tearing down what it is
[2:39:44.860 --> 2:39:51.340]  It is so because of that there they can't stop tearing things down even when they're tearing down their own structures
[2:39:51.340 --> 2:39:58.780]  So what the left has done is they've inadvertently deconstructed their own corporate media artifice through all of the lies
[2:39:58.980 --> 2:40:04.300]  Through all of the deceit they're tearing down the artifice of the FBI and of the Attorney General
[2:40:04.900 --> 2:40:08.940]  Whereas right-wingers used to respect the Attorney General used to respect the FBI
[2:40:09.260 --> 2:40:16.900]  They now think wow the FBI is really an American stancy. Have you watch have you watched the lives of others? Yes, excellent amazing movie
[2:40:16.900 --> 2:40:22.100]  We should if anybody here has not watched a lot of positive for stories. Oh, yeah, it was 100% true story
[2:40:22.100 --> 2:40:25.860]  Yeah, so that it talks about East Germany and how they would spy on you the stancy
[2:40:26.100 --> 2:40:33.180]  We now actually if I made another movie I'd call it American stancy and I would talk about how they murdered Vicki Weaver and then torture
[2:40:33.540 --> 2:40:35.540]  tortured her and mutilated the body and
[2:40:35.820 --> 2:40:41.220]  Go go through all of the things that you know in Waco the feds posed with skulls of the children
[2:40:41.220 --> 2:40:45.020]  Yeah, yeah, that was cute. Yeah people don't know a little skull kid
[2:40:45.020 --> 2:40:51.780]  Yeah, they're they murdered they burned him alive. They burned children alive. I'd called American stancy and I would and I would even talk about how
[2:40:52.380 --> 2:40:59.020]  Post 9-11 they would find mentally ill or mentally handicapped Muslim men and then get him on message boards
[2:40:59.020 --> 2:41:05.060]  And then we say oh we stopped the next we stopped 9-11 and no all you did was found some really lost
[2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:07.660]  mentally disabled Muslim kid and
[2:41:08.300 --> 2:41:10.780]  Trapped him and then propped him up as
[2:41:11.540 --> 2:41:13.540]  some kind of trophy
[2:41:13.540 --> 2:41:19.860]  And now they're trying that with with right wingers in January 6 we're gonna break come back with calls appreciate folks holding Mike Sernovich is
[2:41:20.500 --> 2:41:22.500]  wound up and on fire today
[2:41:22.500 --> 2:41:26.980]  But don't be too bummed out. I mean at least you're right written out shouldn't have been charged. It's wrong
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:29.780]  But can't you find a silver lining in this club? I?
[2:41:30.700 --> 2:41:34.300]  Won't say what I really feel right now. I'm too angry. I'll regret what I say
[2:41:36.260 --> 2:41:38.260]  Hypothetically, what would you say nothing?
[2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:45.380]  I'm not trying to get in trouble, but in a video game in a video game. Here's what I would say in a video game
[2:41:45.380 --> 2:41:47.380]  What would you say?
[2:41:49.820 --> 2:41:51.820]  Smoking toad venom on air folks
[2:41:53.100 --> 2:41:55.100]  DMT DMT lay cigar
[2:41:55.100 --> 2:41:58.380]  No, it's got fentanyl. We're gonna know I bought these from the homeless people
[2:41:58.380 --> 2:42:00.500]  We're all gonna die bought these in the homeless people down there
[2:42:00.500 --> 2:42:05.420]  I actually thought about that where no in a video game people try to give me cigars and I always think
[2:42:05.420 --> 2:42:09.180]  Like I appreciate the gesture about how I know there's not like fentanyl laced in the spark
[2:42:09.180 --> 2:42:12.220]  That's how they would ask it. That's how you have to think at our level is
[2:42:13.380 --> 2:42:17.580]  How would you if you were them? How would you assassinate yourself?
[2:42:17.580 --> 2:42:19.380]  So I only know they come to your house
[2:42:19.380 --> 2:42:22.540]  They shoot you and your wife and your children and they leave a suicide note that you did it

[2:46:59.660 --> 2:47:02.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:47:02.500 --> 2:47:27.780]  All right Mike Cernovich is here with us and I'm trying to convince him to be happy about this verdict
[2:47:27.780 --> 2:47:33.340]  But I get his point we shouldn't be here when they already had all the video footage and the witnesses that a bunch of people are out
[2:47:33.340 --> 2:47:37.460]  Running around burning things down. They attack him. They're beating him. They're saying we're gonna kill you
[2:47:37.460 --> 2:47:43.020]  They're shooting at him and then the whole media acts like something else happened. That is really dangerous
[2:47:43.100 --> 2:47:46.020]  So you're right. It's kind of like getting mauled by a bear
[2:47:46.220 --> 2:47:51.180]  You're like wow it you know I got cuts all over me and my guts are hanging out, but I'm alive
[2:47:51.180 --> 2:47:53.660]  But I guess it's just two ways to see this
[2:47:54.300 --> 2:47:56.780]  yeah, I think I'm more fired up and
[2:47:56.780 --> 2:48:01.980]  Energetically, I think a lot of people are fired up in a good way because we realize now
[2:48:02.380 --> 2:48:07.420]  They're coming for everybody and if this isn't gonna be like the Bolshevik revolution
[2:48:07.900 --> 2:48:13.180]  Where there was people thinking you could sit on the sidelines and the Bolsheviks are gonna leave you alone
[2:48:13.180 --> 2:48:19.420]  They're gonna murder the Kulaks. You were the Kulaks were the Haldemort were the Ukrainian farmers
[2:48:19.460 --> 2:48:23.540]  We are literally the Kulaks. They're all the very same British intelligence money
[2:48:23.540 --> 2:48:31.180]  As you know your form that that ran the Communist takeover of Russia where the British rules killed their cousins the czar is the same group doing this again
[2:48:31.740 --> 2:48:35.740]  Exactly. So people now too many people have woken up. So that's why I'm
[2:48:36.700 --> 2:48:43.180]  Optimistic I know that a few of us are gonna be assassinated me you just we're going to there's just no
[2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:49.420]  There's no way around it. That's why I've you know, I read all the great warrior philosophy
[2:48:49.420 --> 2:48:55.580]  I've resigned myself already to knowing that they are going to assassinate me a hundred percent
[2:48:55.580 --> 2:48:57.580]  there's just no question about it and
[2:48:57.700 --> 2:49:02.020]  I know I've had to resign to that as well. Of course every day is a blessing
[2:49:02.020 --> 2:49:07.740]  Yeah, they're getting you civilly and then they'll go for you criminally and then oh we found drugs in his possession
[2:49:07.740 --> 2:49:10.220]  He was under so much stress. He killed his family himself
[2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:14.740]  Never they killed that happens and you've got to just say they're gonna get my kids anyways
[2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:21.140]  So you just have to just just just just it's the opposite of abandoning all hope. It's turn it over to God and say I have no fear
[2:49:21.140 --> 2:49:23.860]  I'm going into this it's the opposite of bating all hope because
[2:49:24.820 --> 2:49:30.460]  Stress or anxiety only comes from an uncertainty. I know what they're doing. I know what they're plotting
[2:49:30.460 --> 2:49:33.900]  I know what they're thinking. I've wargamed it out five steps ahead of them
[2:49:33.900 --> 2:49:36.740]  And I know all their moves that are helpful. So you're a smart guy
[2:49:36.940 --> 2:49:38.940]  Tell them what you see coming well
[2:49:39.340 --> 2:49:43.060]  Garland you think garland and the FBI are gonna be happy with what has happened
[2:49:43.060 --> 2:49:49.020]  Their human sacrifice was stopped in front of them. This was to them a form of
[2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:53.380]  Ritualistic human sacrifice sacrificing the right of self-defense or an altar
[2:49:53.380 --> 2:49:59.580]  Yeah, and they were sacrificing a child too because remember the sacrifice of the people who have this religion
[2:49:59.580 --> 2:50:04.780]  They always want to sacrifice the younger people and it's that people that's how they believe they get more of the spiritual
[2:50:04.780 --> 2:50:10.460]  Exactly the fact that he was an innocent hero. It's just like burning man or wicker man is who they want
[2:50:10.460 --> 2:50:14.220]  Yeah, so the only thing keeping you alive and me alive is the world men now with gray hair
[2:50:14.340 --> 2:50:20.820]  We're not the veal to them. We're old chewy sin we meet and they'll figure out ways to get us here and there
[2:50:20.900 --> 2:50:27.580]  But they really want the blood ritual sacrifice of the underage and that's why of course they went after written house and they're
[2:50:27.580 --> 2:50:30.700]  They're screaming now what people have to realize is
[2:50:31.380 --> 2:50:34.740]  They will infiltrate more and more any conservative group
[2:50:35.500 --> 2:50:39.580]  You have to be vigilant and you have anytime somebody talks about violence
[2:50:39.580 --> 2:50:43.980]  Get them out. You know, they're provocative out of there anytime. Somebody's walking around
[2:50:44.620 --> 2:50:49.820]  Hot shot tough guy. We have to do more. We can't just talk the time for talking gone
[2:50:49.820 --> 2:50:53.520]  There's little lines all these little infiltrator fed Stasi has they'll say
[2:50:54.020 --> 2:50:57.420]  Sernovich all you do is talk. It's time to take action
[2:50:58.020 --> 2:51:03.380]  Okay, fed nice try fed nice try infiltrator nice try Stasi
[2:51:03.380 --> 2:51:06.260]  So what everyone has to do is if you're gonna be politically involved
[2:51:06.260 --> 2:51:12.220]  Again, remember what Jesus said you have to be gentle as a dove, but they forget the first part
[2:51:12.220 --> 2:51:16.660]  Why is this a serpent that you know, we were talking yesterday about yeah, we have knowledge of evil
[2:51:16.660 --> 2:51:20.260]  We don't use our knowledge of evil, but we know as much as their top operators
[2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:24.460]  That's how I I just get in their mind. I get in their head and I think like them
[2:51:24.460 --> 2:51:28.060]  That's how I know they're gonna do that. That's just that's as wise as a serpent, right?
[2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:33.340]  So the Christian the false prophets will say be gentle as doves. Well, that's not the first
[2:51:33.340 --> 2:51:37.660]  I've read the Bible multiple times in fact Jesus was an expert at
[2:51:38.140 --> 2:51:44.020]  Avoiding the riddles that the Pharisees would give him the office and the Pharisees would constantly try to right get it
[2:51:44.020 --> 2:51:46.540]  Right the laws that kill him they would say oh, you're a tax evader
[2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:49.900]  So what do you do about taxes hoping that they can trap him?
[2:51:50.060 --> 2:51:53.380]  So what I tell people is we have to be wise the serpents and serpents
[2:51:53.380 --> 2:51:56.940]  Of course goes back to the metaphor of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[2:51:56.940 --> 2:52:00.900]  So that's what he's saying there if you go back and look at that it is a deep metaphor
[2:52:00.900 --> 2:52:04.620]  Right to saying you have to have knowledge not just of good
[2:52:04.620 --> 2:52:10.460]  You have to be good, but you have to have knowledge of evil and what happens with this these naive Christians who are
[2:52:10.460 --> 2:52:15.260]  Letters, straight by false prophets is they don't have knowledge of evil. They think when you talk about demons
[2:52:15.260 --> 2:52:20.700]  Oh, I can't believe you believe in demons. That sounds you can't believe it. Jesus passed out lesion because there are many
[2:52:20.700 --> 2:52:25.100]  I often wonder how many these Christian conservatives. I've read we don't really think it's a metaphor
[2:52:25.100 --> 2:52:26.700]  We don't really believe I believe in demons
[2:52:26.700 --> 2:52:31.460]  I know it's real cast them out and they put them in the animals and the interdimensional avatar
[2:52:31.460 --> 2:52:36.260]  Yeah, and we're an open channel. They can take there. They're real. He said he said the demons that I'm lead you
[2:52:36.260 --> 2:52:39.920]  They call me lesion because I'm many and then Christians will say I can't believe son of it
[2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:43.420]  She's talking about demons. Yeah, I can tell you without DMT and all the stuff
[2:52:43.420 --> 2:52:46.100]  I without I don't even need hallucinations when I'm especially a kid
[2:52:46.100 --> 2:52:48.580]  I can see it all there's the veils thinner when you're a child
[2:52:48.580 --> 2:52:51.780]  You've got a lot more DMT already in your brain, and it's a hundred percent real
[2:52:51.780 --> 2:52:58.820]  And all you have to do is read the Bible, right? So the false prophets weaponize the part about being gentle as a dove
[2:52:59.060 --> 2:53:04.380]  To lead people astray they claim that demons are a metaphor. They're not actually real even though that's not biblical
[2:53:04.380 --> 2:53:08.440]  That's actually heresy false teachings of the Bible if you tell people demons aren't real
[2:53:08.580 --> 2:53:15.300]  You're actually a false teacher because Christ himself cast out demons the devil's greatest trip was convincing the world
[2:53:15.300 --> 2:53:16.420]  He didn't exist
[2:53:16.420 --> 2:53:23.420]  But that's that's the move that they want to play that what I'm telling the Christians especially you have to wise as a serpent
[2:53:23.420 --> 2:53:26.820]  What that means is you have to have knowledge of good and evil live good
[2:53:26.820 --> 2:53:32.420]  But no the evil people are plotting the evil people are thinking how can we frame exactly?
[2:53:32.420 --> 2:53:37.740]  They try to make Christians super naive and they go oh, yes, you don't know how they works act like an idiot
[2:53:37.740 --> 2:53:39.980]  No, it's the opposite. You need to know how it all works, right?
[2:53:39.980 --> 2:53:47.260]  That's exactly the point is they have again the false prophets have taught Christians to be naive gullible
[2:53:47.580 --> 2:53:52.940]  It oh turn the other cheek will turn the other cheek actually has was a metaphor because that's only at certain times
[2:53:52.940 --> 2:53:58.100]  Yeah, and they want because and because they the person wiped their hands with their wipe their butt with their other hand
[2:53:58.100 --> 2:54:00.460]  So there's more metaphor to that than people even realize
[2:54:01.100 --> 2:54:06.700]  So that that itself is taught incorrectly by people who want Christians to be naive
[2:54:06.700 --> 2:54:11.420]  Oh turn the other cheek let people steamroll you be gentle as a dove
[2:54:11.900 --> 2:54:13.420]  that's not
[2:54:13.420 --> 2:54:15.420]  Biblical if you read the Bible
[2:54:16.180 --> 2:54:21.980]  Which again unfortunately not enough people have you realize it is good versus evil. It is a demonic
[2:54:21.980 --> 2:54:26.380]  Well, you read the Psalms. There's a place in time for everything. It's a toolkit
[2:54:26.780 --> 2:54:30.860]  So sometimes they're trying to make you violent to so they can take you out right then on their terms
[2:54:31.260 --> 2:54:33.060]  Sometimes you're like Martin Luther King, Jr.
[2:54:33.060 --> 2:54:37.460]  Gandhi following Christ because he was to be a sacrifice. He wasn't gonna let them trick him
[2:54:37.460 --> 2:54:39.460]  He was gonna do the big public sacrifice
[2:54:39.460 --> 2:54:42.740]  Yeah, they were to kill him in the woods right there instead of up in front of everybody
[2:54:42.900 --> 2:54:44.740]  So you got to choose your battles is what that's about
[2:54:44.900 --> 2:54:48.020]  Yeah, they try they do try to bait us into their game
[2:54:48.260 --> 2:54:51.060]  But that's where you have to realize they're trying to bait you into evil
[2:54:51.060 --> 2:54:56.020]  So if you're doing political organizing you have to keep these people out of your group because they are feds
[2:54:56.020 --> 2:55:00.900]  They are infiltrators. They are stasi anybody talks about violence anybody talks about incitement
[2:55:00.900 --> 2:55:02.900]  Anybody talks about
[2:55:03.220 --> 2:55:07.300]  Oh, we can't just talk we have to do more blah blah you have to get rid of them
[2:55:07.300 --> 2:55:08.660]  Or else you're gonna end up set up
[2:55:08.660 --> 2:55:16.100]  So what they'll do always tell folks if you won't politically get involved and be civil disobedient and and and and do all that now in tyranny space
[2:55:16.100 --> 2:55:18.100]  You'll never be violent when the time actually comes
[2:55:18.420 --> 2:55:22.420]  They roll out with mass arrest all the stuff the military and police are gonna join us on average
[2:55:22.580 --> 2:55:26.660]  And it's gonna be a violent worldwide civil war. It's the loblas. It's already about to start in europe
[2:55:26.660 --> 2:55:29.860]  We're not calling for that. We don't initiate that go back to bunker hill
[2:55:29.860 --> 2:55:34.980]  When 1775 and the founding of this country and the redcoats are marching up, you know
[2:55:34.980 --> 2:55:40.020]  Five to one against a little local militia to confiscate the guns and the ammo and they've been told by the local mayor and everybody
[2:55:40.020 --> 2:55:43.540]  You know, we're voting to stand up. We're not turning our guns in that's too far and they said listen
[2:55:43.780 --> 2:55:46.260]  I'm paraphrasing it but the captain said he died that day
[2:55:46.740 --> 2:55:50.260]  He said we're not looking for a war. We're not gonna start a fight. We're not gonna shoot first
[2:55:50.260 --> 2:55:52.820]  But if they shoot it's a war they want it's a war they get
[2:55:52.820 --> 2:55:59.300]  What you said a minute ago was so wise and I'm gonna take that and adopt that
[2:55:59.780 --> 2:56:00.660]  Which is yeah
[2:56:00.660 --> 2:56:05.140]  If you won't show up to your school board meeting because you're afraid that the media is gonna do a nasty article on you
[2:56:05.140 --> 2:56:08.180]  And you're gonna lose your job and how are you talking about violence?
[2:56:08.740 --> 2:56:10.500]  Right, you're afraid of losing your job
[2:56:10.500 --> 2:56:13.780]  You won't even stand up for your own children in school because you want to lose your job
[2:56:14.020 --> 2:56:16.100]  But then you're saying other people need to be violent
[2:56:16.100 --> 2:56:21.780]  So that's a great point if you don't have political courage and their willingness to stand up what's happening now
[2:56:21.780 --> 2:56:27.460]  Civilly and lawfully and politically then get out of here with your fake BS. You're such a tough guy
[2:56:27.860 --> 2:56:32.580]  Well, the people calling for violence always end up to be a southern property law center ADL or FBI operative
[2:56:32.980 --> 2:56:34.660]  scum of the earth and
[2:56:34.660 --> 2:56:38.020]  When you're sitting there, I've had the feds try this before years ago
[2:56:38.100 --> 2:56:42.820]  It had happened a while and I'm like hell, but oh, but you're not gonna be violent. You want me to be violent
[2:56:43.060 --> 2:56:45.060]  You see that that's the real telltale sign
[2:56:45.540 --> 2:56:49.140]  Oh, really? We're all cowards as we haven't gone out and like killed a cop or blown something up
[2:56:49.140 --> 2:56:53.060]  How come we haven't seen you do that? You're the one telling us about all this violence
[2:56:53.540 --> 2:56:59.620]  We had a thing happen. Um, so I had a when I was in arizona a guy with a big trump 45 jersey
[2:57:00.100 --> 2:57:04.020]  Was trying to initiate or he was trying to get a riot to happen
[2:57:04.260 --> 2:57:08.260]  He took a water bottle and threw it at these people and I said, hey man, what are you doing?
[2:57:08.420 --> 2:57:10.100]  Why are you doing this and he goes
[2:57:10.100 --> 2:57:14.980]  I'm gonna be like jesus and jesus flipped over the tables at the tabernacles and I said this is my event
[2:57:14.980 --> 2:57:20.020]  And he goes, I don't care for your event. This is like jesus and I go. Oh, okay. I know what you're doing
[2:57:20.180 --> 2:57:24.340]  This is my liberation theology, but but you don't respect it if it's my event
[2:57:24.900 --> 2:57:31.220]  And you have a big trump 45 black hawks jersey on and you throw in water bottles at people's heads
[2:57:31.620 --> 2:57:35.620]  Try to get something going on. I know right away that that guy was in a 100%
[2:57:35.620 --> 2:57:39.620]  He was southern property law center trash. Oh, there is a sorrows trying to set us up

[3:00:04.180 --> 3:00:06.180]  That would be

[3:00:23.380 --> 3:00:26.180]  Thank you, mr. Jones. Um, I have a question
[3:00:26.980 --> 3:00:31.540]  In the end game when this is all over down here on this earth this we consist of
[3:00:32.420 --> 3:00:36.580]  Do you believe that lucifer or satan will be the one losing in the end?
[3:00:37.140 --> 3:00:38.740]  Oh, I know the devil's gonna lose
[3:00:38.820 --> 3:00:43.940]  I mean the devil can't help the program the devil runs and god gave us free will so evil's gonna exist
[3:00:44.020 --> 3:00:46.020]  I mean, there's no way
[3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:48.260]  Uh, the satan wins a mike. What's your take on that?
[3:00:48.660 --> 3:00:51.060]  Yeah, this is all this has all been ordained the
[3:00:52.100 --> 3:00:55.300]  In the end goodness wins, but it's gonna be a while before that happens
[3:00:56.020 --> 3:00:59.620]  I've been trying to get you here for a couple years and and this was set up months ago
[3:00:59.620 --> 3:01:03.220]  You were gonna come here now. Just like you said that before went live. You said this is ordained
[3:01:03.540 --> 3:01:08.980]  Yeah, it was ordained that we were here during the persecution of call written house
[3:01:09.780 --> 3:01:12.100]  That timing wasn't a coincidence not at all
[3:01:12.100 --> 3:01:17.460]  Well, that's the thing evil has its own system and its own little system, but when you start seeing the mysteries of god
[3:01:17.860 --> 3:01:24.420]  The way it works. It's like, whoa, this is it's crazy. Yeah, it only takes a little bit of light to reveal the darkness
[3:01:26.340 --> 3:01:29.220]  All right, thank you so much robert appreciate your call great question
[3:01:30.100 --> 3:01:35.460]  Let's go ahead and talk to spencer. No, no no spencer coming on the longest. Sorry. I'm dumb. Uh, it'd be uh
[3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:39.620]  Jacob in california. Jacob welcome then alex and florida go ahead
[3:01:39.620 --> 3:01:46.260]  Hey, uh, what's up alex? Uh, long time listener. I've been listening since 2011
[3:01:47.060 --> 3:01:50.500]  Uh, I'm truly awake to everything that's going on. I just want to know like
[3:01:51.220 --> 3:01:57.140]  How do we stop the new world order? I mean, I try to tell people I've been telling everybody about this new world order agenda
[3:01:57.780 --> 3:02:00.020]  And they just act like they believe
[3:02:00.740 --> 3:02:05.780]  But then I find out they went and took the vaccine, you know, like I don't know why I don't know what to do
[3:02:05.780 --> 3:02:08.980]  Well, yeah, a lot of people are in a trance
[3:02:09.860 --> 3:02:13.380]  Literally medically and they're in a date. So they'll agree with you at that time
[3:02:13.460 --> 3:02:15.780]  But it's only to it's only to be nice
[3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:20.500]  But they feel compelled to get it to conform and they think they'll get out of the trap
[3:02:20.580 --> 3:02:23.860]  And they just give the bully what they want. They're literally being abused
[3:02:24.100 --> 3:02:28.500]  So you've got to explain that to them and then just move on you're not going to save everybody
[3:02:28.740 --> 3:02:31.860]  They have free will and they've decided to be slaves. You want to come on that?
[3:02:31.860 --> 3:02:38.340]  Yeah, that's the number one point that I make to people is you have to get over your save the world complex
[3:02:38.580 --> 3:02:42.340]  Save yourself, save your family, save people who want the message
[3:02:42.820 --> 3:02:48.100]  Right, if your house didn't squirt away and if your family isn't saved then you're no no business trying to help other people
[3:02:48.180 --> 3:02:54.420]  Yeah, focus on that divine light within yourself because the divine light shines so brightly that then others will be drawn to it
[3:02:54.420 --> 3:02:59.940]  Like moss to the light so for me and if you hang out with me in real life, a lot of people are surprised
[3:02:59.940 --> 3:03:01.940]  I talk about anything but
[3:03:02.020 --> 3:03:03.700]  The things that are happening in the world
[3:03:03.700 --> 3:03:08.500]  I just hang out and if people want to to learn more and open their eyes and that's fine
[3:03:08.980 --> 3:03:11.220]  But otherwise I talk about anything what you're saying key
[3:03:11.300 --> 3:03:14.580]  We have to build our own civilization and separate from them
[3:03:14.580 --> 3:03:20.740]  You're right because then people will be attracted to that the types we want people that want filth and pedophilion and collapse
[3:03:20.740 --> 3:03:25.540]  They're going to go to that. Yeah, you have all these people from california liberals moving to texas
[3:03:25.540 --> 3:03:30.340]  Florida, Idaho, but they're unfortunately heard of the heard a good expression from someone
[3:03:30.340 --> 3:03:33.620]  He said that we welcome the refugees, but not the locusts
[3:03:34.100 --> 3:03:37.940]  He's talking about the california people who are leaving california because it's gone insane
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:42.980]  Well, I'm not trying to brag, but I said that years ago, but everybody probably it's the same analogy
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:48.020]  I don't want to say I coined it. But yeah, that's it. We welcome we rep we welcome refugees that want to escape it
[3:03:48.180 --> 3:03:54.180]  But not the locust right so we know that inevitably people are leaving california has net migration
[3:03:54.180 --> 3:04:00.260]  I posted this a while ago on twitter if you look up the u-haul rate or leaving california going to texas or arizona
[3:04:00.740 --> 3:04:06.740]  Versus the other ways three or four times as much to leave california because all the u-hauls are based on a logistics
[3:04:07.620 --> 3:04:11.540]  And let's go further. I think something like eight times more people are moving out moving in
[3:04:11.860 --> 3:04:13.860]  And those moving in our third world
[3:04:14.020 --> 3:04:16.020]  Who again that the globalists can exploit
[3:04:17.220 --> 3:04:19.620]  Less and less though, I mean the virginia election
[3:04:19.620 --> 3:04:25.700]  And showed a lot of good hispanic turnout. So the republicans disantis is doing all right
[3:04:25.940 --> 3:04:29.780]  The republican party still has to get that. No, I hear you jacob. Is you have anything else dad?
[3:04:31.060 --> 3:04:34.980]  Yeah, uh, don't hang up. We're back. We're going to break for 60 seconds. Some stations join us
[3:04:35.220 --> 3:04:40.820]  I'm gonna come right back to jacob and again, sir, which you're saying you're not updating sernovich.com the best place
[3:04:41.140 --> 3:04:44.500]  hoax the movie.com hoax movie.com hoax movie.com
[3:04:44.500 --> 3:04:48.900]  I'm glad to have mike sernovich here during this big day of the call written house trial and he's right
[3:04:48.900 --> 3:04:51.780]  They're getting ready with dirty tricks. They're going to strike back big time
[3:04:51.780 --> 3:04:54.500]  They'll probably blow up a federal building and say the guy did it for call written house
[3:04:56.020 --> 3:04:58.020]  There are so many crap
[3:05:00.580 --> 3:05:02.580]  Your voice counts
[3:05:02.580 --> 3:05:09.860]  When you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular
[3:05:09.860 --> 3:05:16.580]  They know you're angry and now to get around big tech. It's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got

[3:05:59.860 --> 3:06:02.580]  You found it the tip of the spear
[3:06:02.580 --> 3:06:05.380]  It is the alex joneshow
[3:06:07.220 --> 3:06:13.220]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country
[3:06:15.380 --> 3:06:20.740]  Harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things are for me
[3:06:22.660 --> 3:06:28.580]  And I don't mind you switching sides and standing up things they believe in
[3:06:28.580 --> 3:06:34.980]  When they're running down my country, man, they're walking on fighting side-by-side
[3:06:34.980 --> 3:06:39.940]  Oh, we've got the filmmaker, lawyer, podcaster
[3:06:41.140 --> 3:06:44.580]  Mike's starting to be cheer with us in studio. We're going to write back to your phone calls
[3:06:44.580 --> 3:06:46.580]  But I got I got to raise this point
[3:06:46.980 --> 3:06:49.300]  Because I don't talk about this enough and you encapsulate it really well
[3:06:49.700 --> 3:06:54.580]  And we can go into 100 hours of documentation and declassified CIA and Ford Foundation documents
[3:06:54.580 --> 3:06:59.140]  But they said we want ugly culture ugly buildings. We want to deconstruct
[3:06:59.140 --> 3:07:02.740]  We don't want the old world to look good because we're building a new world
[3:07:02.740 --> 3:07:10.420]  But then what they build is even uglier and so I don't understand the spiritual position even though I can get in the enemy's mind of wanting
[3:07:11.300 --> 3:07:14.740]  Because I can work in how they operate and and I know how they behave
[3:07:15.060 --> 3:07:20.260]  But I still can't get why they want to hurt innocents why they want to make ugliness why they want to kill a planet
[3:07:20.900 --> 3:07:22.900]  Well, they said they want to save it
[3:07:22.900 --> 3:07:24.580]  Well, that's
[3:07:24.580 --> 3:07:27.380]  Evil that's why we have to study evil and learn
[3:07:28.020 --> 3:07:28.980]  the
[3:07:28.980 --> 3:07:35.140]  Nature of evil and the religion and theology of evil theology of evil has fundamentally been built built on destruction
[3:07:35.540 --> 3:07:39.300]  Is built on harming people is built on destroying things that's their aesthetic
[3:07:39.540 --> 3:07:41.540]  That's why everything is very dark
[3:07:41.540 --> 3:07:43.140]  Everything is very
[3:07:43.140 --> 3:07:46.260]  You can just feel the negativity in the old testament
[3:07:46.740 --> 3:07:51.780]  Moses is like stop stabbing and cutting yourselves and hurting yourselves. Yeah, but that's that's the religion
[3:07:51.780 --> 3:07:56.900]  That's what the the biggest transition people need to make to wake up is realize that
[3:07:57.540 --> 3:08:02.180]  When you wake up and thank god for the day and when you go to bed and you thank god for the day that you had
[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:05.940]  The demons have their religion to the people who
[3:08:06.580 --> 3:08:11.860]  Unfortunately have taken over the democrat party. I hate to think of half of the country. It is the demon party
[3:08:11.940 --> 3:08:14.740]  I hate to really I used to not like that kind of rhetoric
[3:08:14.740 --> 3:08:19.940]  But after written house is really hard to see otherwise when they're defending literally a serial child rapist
[3:08:19.940 --> 3:08:25.140]  There's no other there's no other way to explain it what they are. There's team freedom and there's team demon
[3:08:25.540 --> 3:08:30.100]  Well, they're evil, right? They want to destroy everything and they want to get their little feed in and destroy everything
[3:08:30.420 --> 3:08:35.380]  Because to them human suffering is their religion, right? That's what people have to understand
[3:08:35.620 --> 3:08:40.420]  There's virtue and there's vice. That's why they get vice on people because they get people hooked to drugs
[3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:42.580]  That's why we have a hundred thousand overdoses a year
[3:08:42.580 --> 3:08:46.180]  So it's kill still and destroy and I guess there's no reforming demons, is there?
[3:08:46.180 --> 3:08:49.860]  Well, no because that's their energy their energy comes from human suffering, right?
[3:08:50.180 --> 3:08:53.220]  So once you understand the energy from your research, where do these things come from?
[3:08:53.460 --> 3:08:58.180]  Like why are they allowed to operate because I get free will but if I had free will I would even I mean if these demons
[3:08:58.180 --> 3:09:02.580]  weren't running around this bad, I wouldn't have to deal with it like I'm sure we still have problems
[3:09:02.660 --> 3:09:04.660]  But my god, these are some nasty suckers
[3:09:05.300 --> 3:09:10.980]  Well, that's that goes into theology of why would and it goes to the simulation conversation that we had yesterday which is
[3:09:10.980 --> 3:09:18.020]  Yes, Lewis and others have talked about, you know the problem of evil. Why does evil exist and evil exists unfortunately because
[3:09:18.580 --> 3:09:24.580]  It allows you to find virtue for you to ascend to another level and to test you and you're godly
[3:09:24.740 --> 3:09:26.420]  That's why it exists
[3:09:26.420 --> 3:09:28.580]  And it also couldn't be otherwise
[3:09:29.060 --> 3:09:33.940]  You can't have an upside without a downside. You can't have a god's all about free will so god's not
[3:09:34.660 --> 3:09:36.660]  animating these things these are
[3:09:36.660 --> 3:09:43.300]  People and entities spirits whatever they were that decided to become this and he created us and some of us will listen to heaven
[3:09:43.300 --> 3:09:47.620]  And some of us will they're choosing that they want to go to hell and dwell on darkness for eternity
[3:09:47.940 --> 3:09:53.300]  So that's what it comes down to too is we have to realize that what happens here matters what we do matters
[3:09:54.020 --> 3:09:57.620]  This is a trial though. We're all on trial written house was just on trial
[3:09:58.020 --> 3:10:03.060]  The real trial is for our immortal souls every day that we walk this earth. We're on trial
[3:10:03.060 --> 3:10:06.980]  That's why evil put trial Kyle written house on trial
[3:10:07.140 --> 3:10:11.860]  But that's a reminder that oh, we're watching the Kyle written house trial. No, we're on trial
[3:10:12.260 --> 3:10:16.580]  Our nature is being tested every day. We fail sometimes. We succeed sometimes
[3:10:16.580 --> 3:10:20.100]  We're always trying to to take that trend line to a higher level
[3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:25.220]  The trial is non-stop. It's never ending written house will be on trial the rest of his life
[3:10:25.300 --> 3:10:29.380]  Not just from the system, but also for his soul the more that we focus on
[3:10:29.380 --> 3:10:32.580]  And contextualize what's happening to us
[3:10:33.380 --> 3:10:36.260]  As it isn't just a worldly temporary moment
[3:10:36.900 --> 3:10:42.580]  This is part of the never-ending unrelenting battle in our life. I totally agree. We're gonna cause but
[3:10:42.820 --> 3:10:44.820]  Is it the archetype of everything written house?
[3:10:45.140 --> 3:10:48.500]  Like he's kind of goofy not wimpy but not like super manly
[3:10:48.900 --> 3:10:52.580]  And then he doesn't like stand a proposition and kill him when he's defending himself. He's down
[3:10:53.140 --> 3:10:57.540]  On his back. He's defending. I mean all of it's archetypal. It's extremely archetypal
[3:10:57.540 --> 3:11:05.300]  He was the the prodigal son in many ways. It's archetypal to the degree that my mother-in-law is
[3:11:06.100 --> 3:11:07.940]  A cnn watching leftist
[3:11:08.020 --> 3:11:12.900]  She's not like these demon worshipers because she cried during the written house testimony and she said
[3:11:13.220 --> 3:11:17.860]  But she finally actually wants some of the trial and she said to shana. How are they doing this to that poor boy?
[3:11:18.500 --> 3:11:23.060]  So even even died in the world democrat voters like my mother-in-law
[3:11:23.060 --> 3:11:28.660]  Saw what happened. I called the persecution of st. Kyle is what we just witnessed
[3:11:29.140 --> 3:11:32.660]  And I've saw that democrats like my mother-in-law
[3:11:33.380 --> 3:11:36.580]  Realized and maybe that opened the door a little bit to understand that everything well
[3:11:36.580 --> 3:11:43.220]  That's it the demons the one the devils in control manipulate the the goodness in people too. That's what's really sad is they've got
[3:11:43.700 --> 3:11:45.220]  I said like
[3:11:45.220 --> 3:11:49.220]  Satan's carriage is actually like pulled by a bunch of well-meaning people that are deceived
[3:11:49.220 --> 3:11:53.780]  Well evil always goes too far too. That's what we have to understand. That's why we have to always
[3:11:54.340 --> 3:12:00.100]  Hold ourselves to not go too far. Yeah, because evil will always go too far going after car written house was too far
[3:12:00.340 --> 3:12:05.940]  It was tactically unsound if you were to if I were part of the demon squad and we are roundtabling things and
[3:12:06.180 --> 3:12:10.180]  Working on a whiteboard in the demon war room and they said hey, we're gonna lynch
[3:12:10.820 --> 3:12:14.420]  A 17 year old who killed a serial pedophile
[3:12:14.420 --> 3:12:19.780]  I was trying to kill him. Yeah, who's trying to kill him. I would say no would not are you are you absurd?
[3:12:20.180 --> 3:12:24.100]  By the way speaking around table demons. I haven't played the verdict again. I haven't played
[3:12:25.380 --> 3:12:28.020]  Biden came out to show the video talk about demon circle
[3:12:28.180 --> 3:12:33.060]  He's saying I believe in juries and and saying drop it. So even he gets it's a losing deal
[3:12:33.380 --> 3:12:36.980]  And he's gonna be sued for those lies that he spread where you call him a white supremacist
[3:12:37.140 --> 3:12:40.900]  Yeah, he's gonna be sued for all that a lot of people look at him. I mean you want to talk about a senile
[3:12:41.140 --> 3:12:42.420]  Oh, that's a demon right there
[3:12:42.420 --> 3:12:44.420]  Right, man. So they're all
[3:12:44.500 --> 3:12:47.140]  Concerned now because they know that they're all going to be
[3:12:47.780 --> 3:12:53.540]  sued by written house and written house will have the biggest legal defense fund in human history when he goes after all these people
[3:12:53.780 --> 3:12:57.860]  And yeah, biden's realizing. Oh man. This is bad for us. There's no
[3:12:58.500 --> 3:13:04.900]  The only reason that they are even able to get away with what that they're getting away with is republicans haven't gone hard enough
[3:13:04.980 --> 3:13:06.580]  onto this angle
[3:13:06.580 --> 3:13:12.900]  Republicans really talk like you and I talked they would have 300 seats in the house. Oh, they would they would win overnight
[3:13:13.060 --> 3:13:14.900]  But they're all intimidated by cnn
[3:13:14.900 --> 3:13:18.580]  This is the most important thing you said on a lot of little said a lot of boring stuff
[3:13:19.060 --> 3:13:23.940]  They the republicans are like a lion tamed by a mouse and the mouse was like a little whip and the lines like
[3:13:24.740 --> 3:13:28.740]  I mean, they're just so afraid of everything the democrats and people
[3:13:29.380 --> 3:13:31.220]  I mean, I don't want to give them secrets, but
[3:13:31.220 --> 3:13:36.980]  Politico like seven eight nine ten years ago when rampall won the senate and we helped get him elected and they called me go
[3:13:37.940 --> 3:13:42.820]  How do we defeat him next time? I said endorsing if politico had endorsed paul
[3:13:42.820 --> 3:13:47.300]  He would have lost like I'm like these people call me. We're gonna destroy you on hbo
[3:13:47.300 --> 3:13:52.020]  We're gonna destroy you in this thing in netflix and I go good making as horrible as you can
[3:13:53.540 --> 3:13:59.060]  I mean, but they're so arrogant. They have a blind spot that like the public hates you the more you attack me the
[3:13:59.060 --> 3:14:02.660]  More they don't get it. They just don't understand again evil has no limit
[3:14:03.060 --> 3:14:05.940]  There's no limit to nihilism. There's no limit to evil
[3:14:06.180 --> 3:14:08.500]  But that leads them that's how we lead them astray
[3:14:08.660 --> 3:14:14.820]  So the going back to when jesus talked about knowledge of good and evil and to be as wise as a serpent as gentle as a dove
[3:14:15.300 --> 3:14:19.220]  What we do is we're leading them astray. Oh, yeah, go defend pedophiles
[3:14:19.460 --> 3:14:23.140]  Go do that. Oh wait now you've defended them and now we can say for the rest of your life
[3:14:23.460 --> 3:14:27.060]  You defend pedophiles and they go well sue you for oh really? Here's your tweet
[3:14:27.060 --> 3:14:30.100]  Here's your tweet you did you literally defend pedophiles?
[3:14:30.340 --> 3:14:36.340]  So we need the republican party in mass to come out and say that we demand
[3:14:37.060 --> 3:14:41.060]  That every democrat disavowed pedophiles
[3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:48.260]  We demand there's a life sentence for pedophiles. That's so my god. That's so good the anti pedophile pledge
[3:14:48.660 --> 3:14:53.380]  Because the democrats are endorsing them everywhere. Oh, that's genius. Yes. Yeah, but of course
[3:14:53.380 --> 3:15:00.420]  No republican will do it. They're just too dumb. I mean they just they don't have the divine fire because they're the false prophets
[3:15:00.660 --> 3:15:05.220]  If you have the divine fire the divine fire seeks all those to burn away evil
[3:15:05.620 --> 3:15:08.900]  And if they have that divine spark within themselves, they would just say
[3:15:09.460 --> 3:15:12.820]  Ilhan Omar, why are you defending a pedophile a serial pedophile?
[3:15:13.060 --> 3:15:19.060]  They would be but they never use the weapons they've got right all they have to do is pick them up victories are in their hand
[3:15:19.060 --> 3:15:24.260]  It's easy all they have to do is pick them up and then the car the birthright to the planet the universe is ours
[3:15:24.820 --> 3:15:28.340]  What we got free will we got to take it and that's why when we're attacked
[3:15:29.220 --> 3:15:32.660]  And I've been attacked they've made home movies about me written books about me to attack me
[3:15:32.660 --> 3:15:36.740]  I'm sure that they'll attack me more assassinate me real and metaphorically
[3:15:37.380 --> 3:15:38.820]  But that only
[3:15:38.820 --> 3:15:40.980]  Turned me into someone who hates pedophiles
[3:15:41.380 --> 3:15:46.660]  So they went out of their way to smear me, but most people go I look you up and apparently you hate pedophiles
[3:15:46.660 --> 3:15:51.300]  So that's your thing. You know, haha, we'll be right back stay with us. I promise. I'm going to your calls
[3:15:51.700 --> 3:15:53.700]  This is the segment I want to write to you
[3:15:55.140 --> 3:16:01.380]  What if you could cut the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today
[3:16:01.860 --> 3:16:06.260]  Half the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating
[3:16:06.900 --> 3:16:11.380]  Experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease
[3:16:11.380 --> 3:16:18.980]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[3:16:19.220 --> 3:16:23.940]  Hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell
[3:16:24.260 --> 3:16:30.180]  We know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do
[3:16:31.140 --> 3:16:36.260]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell
[3:16:36.260 --> 3:16:42.820]  Then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end
[3:16:43.060 --> 3:16:46.740]  And so we must prepare get up to a year's worth of storable foods
[3:16:47.300 --> 3:16:48.980]  water filtration
[3:16:48.980 --> 3:16:50.740]  survival gear seeds
[3:16:50.740 --> 3:16:53.220]  shortwave radios and life-saving knowledge
[3:16:53.860 --> 3:16:58.260]  At info or store com. I know you're humble. I know you're like me
[3:16:59.060 --> 3:17:01.060]  But I really want you to sit back and
[3:17:01.700 --> 3:17:03.700]  cogitate or meditate
[3:17:03.700 --> 3:17:05.700]  on the fact that
[3:17:05.780 --> 3:17:12.420]  Those of you that have supported my broadcast and info wars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways and now
[3:17:13.060 --> 3:17:13.860]  as
[3:17:13.860 --> 3:17:15.220]  2021
[3:17:15.220 --> 3:17:17.220]  prepares to end at 2022
[3:17:17.940 --> 3:17:20.580]  Begins to dawn it is more important than ever
[3:17:21.060 --> 3:17:26.820]  That you realize how important you are that you be more active than you've ever been the tip of the sphere is band up
[3:17:27.540 --> 3:17:30.980]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is info wars.com
[3:17:30.980 --> 3:17:36.020]  And we can't stay on air without your support. So thank you all for your support
[3:17:36.420 --> 3:17:40.900]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air and save info wars.com
[3:17:41.220 --> 3:17:44.900]  Let's save info wars.com and continue to go to info wars store.com
[3:17:45.140 --> 3:17:50.660]  But right now we've got turbo force sold out for months 10 hours clean energy back and stop the free shipping
[3:17:51.060 --> 3:17:54.100]  40 percent off and so many other great problems
[3:17:54.100 --> 3:18:01.620]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[3:18:02.260 --> 3:18:07.940]  And in that documentary, I predicted the globalist would establish world government by releasing a virus
[3:18:08.820 --> 3:18:10.820]  demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns
[3:18:11.380 --> 3:18:13.860]  And then triggering a collapse of our industrial society
[3:18:14.500 --> 3:18:16.180]  And now they've done it
[3:18:16.180 --> 3:18:24.340]  How did I know they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked?
[3:18:24.340 --> 3:18:28.180]  You see then I was tracking the builder group who's head at the time was claus schwa
[3:18:28.820 --> 3:18:33.540]  And our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great reset
[3:18:34.020 --> 3:18:38.180]  Well, we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world
[3:18:38.740 --> 3:18:43.620]  None attached to the tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship. No due process
[3:18:43.620 --> 3:18:45.620]  Destruction of the family
[3:18:46.180 --> 3:18:52.820]  And then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass creating these vaccines to poisonousity populace
[3:18:53.140 --> 3:18:55.780]  This is what info wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future
[3:18:56.820 --> 3:19:02.740]  I'm sitting here. It's in the early morning hours, and I'm looking at mainstream news
[3:19:04.180 --> 3:19:08.500]  Reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said
[3:19:08.500 --> 3:19:13.700]  That the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children
[3:19:14.180 --> 3:19:19.060]  Because he and studies they did on children. It caused myocarditis. That's heart swelling and heart attacks
[3:19:20.180 --> 3:19:25.140]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the associated press. It's not getting any circulation
[3:19:25.140 --> 3:19:30.660]  It's not on the national news and it's very hard to even file in places like instagram or twitter. It's just crazy and then
[3:19:31.460 --> 3:19:33.460]  Fauci was on tv just yesterday
[3:19:33.940 --> 3:19:36.740]  Saying there's no damage from the vaccines. It doesn't hurt anybody
[3:19:36.740 --> 3:19:38.740]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you say it
[3:19:39.380 --> 3:19:45.300]  It's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems
[3:19:45.540 --> 3:19:47.940]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened
[3:19:48.660 --> 3:19:53.380]  That's why info wars is on air because if we weren't on air they get away with even more of this crap
[3:19:53.620 --> 3:19:55.620]  This is just insane. These people are killers
[3:19:55.620 --> 3:20:03.460]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:26.580 --> 3:20:30.260]  Oh, well, you didn't ask alex jones. I keep the answer
[3:20:31.460 --> 3:20:34.260]  I got what I was after long before I died
[3:20:38.420 --> 3:20:40.900]  By the way, I forgot I got call written house his cell phone number
[3:20:42.020 --> 3:20:44.420]  I was like, hey, we have his contact right his mom's been on the show
[3:20:45.460 --> 3:20:47.700]  And so we'll try to get him on as soon as we can
[3:20:48.260 --> 3:20:52.020]  And we're also trying to get his lawyers on the show. We got a lawyer right here with this mike sternovich
[3:20:52.020 --> 3:20:57.380]  I promise to go to phone calls. We're doing it right now. I gotta tell you sternovich. This is one hell of a time to be alive, isn't it?
[3:20:58.660 --> 3:21:02.820]  You know, we we pray for interesting times and we get the interesting times and then we
[3:21:03.540 --> 3:21:08.020]  Get mad at god that appraise grant prayers were answered the paradox of humanity
[3:21:09.140 --> 3:21:11.620]  I'm not mad though. I appreciate it. I like it all actually
[3:21:11.780 --> 3:21:14.740]  I don't like the evil, but I'm this is one hell of an adventure man
[3:21:15.220 --> 3:21:20.100]  Wow, this is quite a timeline. All right, jacob to finish up your points. Sorry to make you whole go ahead. We love you
[3:21:20.100 --> 3:21:22.100]  Yeah, we love you. I love you too, alex. Uh,
[3:21:22.660 --> 3:21:29.380]  Yeah, so, uh, I'm Armenian. Uh, and you know, we've been through the genocide. So before I was even before I even found you
[3:21:29.380 --> 3:21:35.380]  I already knew about caring and authoritarianism. So say that again. Where were you from Armenia?
[3:21:36.100 --> 3:21:40.660]  Oh my god, the Armenian genocide of a million and a half people killed by the young turks
[3:21:41.060 --> 3:21:46.020]  Which the ADL by the way denied the Armenian genocide until 2016 because that's that's because that's christians getting killed
[3:21:46.020 --> 3:21:50.740]  They denied it. So people have called me a liar for that. You're your people could find that in a second
[3:21:51.060 --> 3:21:56.100]  No, I remember they called you a liar. Yeah, they said, oh, you're that's a conspiracy theorist. No, here's the article
[3:21:56.340 --> 3:22:01.060]  AP yeah, here's the article they denied it until 2016 until they couldn't deny it anymore
[3:22:01.780 --> 3:22:04.740]  So that goes to show that when christians are genocided
[3:22:05.540 --> 3:22:12.020]  Who cares right that's the answer from the left exactly. So you're saying you're Armenian. You understand, but please continue
[3:22:12.020 --> 3:22:17.060]  Yeah, so I see the authoritarianism and I feel like it's like a 21st century technocratic
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:19.620]  version of that and I
[3:22:20.020 --> 3:22:22.020]  I tell my Armenian friends and
[3:22:22.660 --> 3:22:27.700]  They think all this is far-fetched information and I try to wake them up, you know, a lot of them
[3:22:27.700 --> 3:22:31.300]  I woke up a lot of people, but there's just some people I just can't get
[3:22:31.700 --> 3:22:36.900]  Wow, so even though they're great grandparents, it happened to them and their grandparents, they won't believe it
[3:22:36.900 --> 3:22:42.500]  Exactly and that's what shocks me about it. Jacob. We love you in a personal call. God bless you
[3:22:44.340 --> 3:22:46.340]  Sir, I wish you want to comment on that. We'll take more calls
[3:22:46.340 --> 3:22:50.900]  Well, that goes to again the nightivity because our many is a very christian that goes to tonightivity of the christian
[3:22:51.780 --> 3:22:53.780]  That's why it's our role
[3:22:54.020 --> 3:22:55.060]  to
[3:22:55.060 --> 3:22:57.060]  How christians clipping naive
[3:22:57.380 --> 3:23:04.020]  Right? Well, why can't it happen here? Why can't it happen again when left-wing organizations including Barack Obama tonight the Armenian genocidal too?
[3:23:04.020 --> 3:23:08.900]  Right? This is objectively true. By the way, the Turks bragged in the news. They were doing it at the time
[3:23:08.900 --> 3:23:14.820]  It's it's not a debatable deal. It's not debatable whether it happened, but it was denied by left-wing groups. Well, exactly
[3:23:14.820 --> 3:23:20.740]  But they deny everything, right? Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Florida. Alex. Thanks for holding go ahead
[3:23:21.700 --> 3:23:26.900]  Hey, thank you for having me on the show guys. Um, I want to first start by saying I agree with both of you
[3:23:26.900 --> 3:23:30.580]  We shouldn't ever got to here, but thank goodness that he was found not guilty
[3:23:30.580 --> 3:23:34.900]  I definitely consider that a victory. Um, and I know it's kind of old news
[3:23:34.900 --> 3:23:37.940]  I kind of wanted to bring it back to the Travis Scott concert
[3:23:37.940 --> 3:23:41.460]  Um, my girlfriend and I we were talking about it and we've done research and
[3:23:41.700 --> 3:23:47.220]  We think that somehow some way a frequency was sent out or the music may have triggered
[3:23:48.020 --> 3:23:51.860]  Adverse reactions and all of those hundreds of people if they were vaccinated
[3:23:52.420 --> 3:23:57.860]  Um, just because with all that sound just smelled like Psyop and then they had they caught me
[3:23:57.860 --> 3:24:02.260]  Anybody that dies a smurf and he was wearing a shirt of a smurf going into a door that turns red
[3:24:02.820 --> 3:24:08.820]  See you on the other side the devil flapping above it adds the newspaper. You're all gonna die. I mean, I I don't know if the
[3:24:08.820 --> 3:24:14.660]  I don't know if the artists were conscious, but the forces behind it. Absolutely did a mass ritual. My view, Mike
[3:24:15.380 --> 3:24:17.380]  Yeah, I don't think it was a vaccine at all
[3:24:17.380 --> 3:24:23.300]  What the issue that people have to worry about is music does create certain vibrations
[3:24:23.300 --> 3:24:28.660]  So bernard will be since it's all been studied scientifically
[3:24:29.300 --> 3:24:33.940]  People have to be careful when you get in with the group of people who become collectively
[3:24:34.420 --> 3:24:35.780]  Under hypnosis
[3:24:35.780 --> 3:24:40.020]  Right, that's that music because there's a sixth sense. There's a broadcast that's why people can sync up in a war
[3:24:40.340 --> 3:24:44.740]  Or whatever or in a church we think of I mean they would you think up you think up
[3:24:44.740 --> 3:24:49.940]  Yeah, they would play drums in the revolution a war so people are not mindful of that when you're listening to music
[3:24:49.940 --> 3:24:50.900]  You're in a hypnotic state
[3:24:50.900 --> 3:24:54.420]  So for me, I don't listen to I used to listen to
[3:24:55.220 --> 3:25:00.420]  Uh certain kind of death metal certain kind of rap me too. I can't listen. I can't listen to any of it now
[3:25:00.420 --> 3:25:03.780]  Because even though I it puts you in that state and exactly a drum
[3:25:05.620 --> 3:25:06.900]  It's you ready for death, right?
[3:25:06.900 --> 3:25:12.100]  So you're hypnotizing yourself and now you're in a group of people who have collectively hypnotized themselves
[3:25:12.500 --> 3:25:16.660]  And then they could be led but let us stray. Let's be clear. It's part of what we did to win wars
[3:25:16.660 --> 3:25:21.700]  But that's how old mind control is marching armies with a drum all as one
[3:25:22.180 --> 3:25:25.940]  And people are being killed right next to you, but you don't care because of that simple mind control
[3:25:26.180 --> 3:25:30.020]  Imagine when they can do it a concert with all that Mike. That's a great point. Yeah music is hypnotic
[3:25:30.020 --> 3:25:34.340]  That's why I tell people you have to be mindful of what you listen to and I used to listen to all that stuff
[3:25:34.340 --> 3:25:36.900]  But I only want to listen to music now about love
[3:25:37.460 --> 3:25:39.060]  opening up my soul
[3:25:39.060 --> 3:25:42.260]  And then when I do listen to music that has a chant element to it
[3:25:42.260 --> 3:25:49.140]  Like sounds a issue or something. I know what it's doing though. I know that okay. This music is hypnotic in a way
[3:25:49.300 --> 3:25:52.260]  But then you can direct it where you want you use to control it
[3:25:52.340 --> 3:25:57.940]  So I listen to a lot of really deep spiritual music with drums, but isn't where I'm passively receiving it
[3:25:58.180 --> 3:26:02.340]  Let me ask you a question. Yeah, and uh, Alex finish your point. I got a question. Go ahead
[3:26:03.380 --> 3:26:08.020]  Uh, well, yeah, I just brought it up because you know all the heart attacks and with everything we know about the vaccine
[3:26:08.020 --> 3:26:15.460]  I thought maybe the music may trigger something with the graphing, but um, the last thing I wanted to say is is
[3:26:15.540 --> 3:26:19.140]  Um, definitely wanted to plug the storeable food. I love it. I eat it
[3:26:19.220 --> 3:26:23.700]  I have a year supply of it and to quote the bible, you know proverbs in the house of the wise
[3:26:23.860 --> 3:26:25.940]  There are stores of choice oils and foods
[3:26:26.020 --> 3:26:32.500]  But the fool devours all that he has and with these uncertain times support the info or broadcast and buy some food
[3:26:32.900 --> 3:26:36.340]  That's right. We've got really good food at a low price. You could pay a lot more and get something better
[3:26:36.340 --> 3:26:39.540]  But for the price you pay, it's good quality food. It's what I use for my family
[3:26:39.860 --> 3:26:41.940]  And and then they definitely want us to pin it on the system
[3:26:41.940 --> 3:26:44.660]  So yeah info or store.com and thanks for the plug
[3:26:44.740 --> 3:26:47.940]  But but we're gonna go to break the few minutes and come back to calls, but I want to ask this question
[3:26:48.820 --> 3:26:51.780]  I don't have some organized system of belief
[3:26:51.860 --> 3:26:56.580]  I'm just experiencing some of my life and I know what's real and I know that I can listen to certain types of hypnotic music
[3:26:57.300 --> 3:27:00.020]  and you know, whether whether it's it's, uh
[3:27:00.020 --> 3:27:06.980]  Wintered skinnered or whether it's Beethoven or whether it's dancing dance. It's obviously black magic. He admits that's dark energy
[3:27:07.300 --> 3:27:10.660]  But I I don't want to be like a sorcerer. This is why I can control this
[3:27:10.900 --> 3:27:15.060]  I don't even listen to a lot of that stuff because even though I can use that and undoubtedly
[3:27:15.540 --> 3:27:19.300]  Suck energy right out of the planet. I mean I can like if I need to just get power like
[3:27:20.020 --> 3:27:21.620]  But I don't even do that like something about it now
[3:27:21.620 --> 3:27:24.340]  I was like, I don't do that when I was younger and stuff. I would do it
[3:27:24.340 --> 3:27:25.620]  But but what is that energy?
[3:27:25.620 --> 3:27:31.860]  Do you think where with our will could actually energize ourselves out of the I'm like literally sucking it out of another dimension
[3:27:32.260 --> 3:27:38.020]  We're all connected energetically to each other in a collective consciousness and we're all connected to the land in the soil
[3:27:38.660 --> 3:27:43.060]  So what you're doing is working on different vibrational frequencies and feeling and
[3:27:43.140 --> 3:27:47.540]  Intuiting because you're a very intuitive person. You're intuitive the energetic frequency
[3:27:47.540 --> 3:27:50.660]  So you might not be able to intellectualize it. You might not be able to no I agree
[3:27:50.660 --> 3:27:52.340]  But I don't want to take power from somebody
[3:27:52.340 --> 3:27:56.580]  Where's that power coming from? No, the power comes from you when you connect to the divine
[3:27:56.660 --> 3:28:00.500]  No, I know I'm making connection. That's what I'm saying. Where's the power coming from on the other side?
[3:28:01.140 --> 3:28:03.700]  Oh, that's the riddle of existence. Yeah, right
[3:28:05.860 --> 3:28:11.060]  But but then I think depending on the type of music you're listening to that that that that that's what controls the tuning of it
[3:28:11.060 --> 3:28:15.780]  It's all yeah, it's all vibrational the the source. I mean the riddle of existence the source is
[3:28:16.740 --> 3:28:20.660]  How did we get here? Right? Who is God? Where did God come?
[3:28:20.660 --> 3:28:23.380]  Well, there's almost when you do that. You're like, whoa, this is super powerful
[3:28:23.380 --> 3:28:25.380]  Like is it even good to dial into that?
[3:28:25.380 --> 3:28:28.420]  Oh, again, that's why it isn't for newbies
[3:28:28.580 --> 3:28:34.260]  That's why I wouldn't tell a 13 year old that you should chant you shouldn't do a lot of this kundalini magic
[3:28:34.660 --> 3:28:38.900]  Maybe you never should some kundalini. Um, yeah, some Christians would say you should never do kundalini
[3:28:39.060 --> 3:28:40.900]  And I respect their point of view
[3:28:40.900 --> 3:28:43.220]  But I know that there are ways to tap into
[3:28:43.940 --> 3:28:45.940]  Your own guided
[3:28:46.020 --> 3:28:49.700]  Experiences with a lot of these I call them technologies more than magic because I do
[3:28:49.700 --> 3:28:53.860]  You know that magic is the old term for technology. Yeah, it's technologies magic. Falls are straight ahead
[3:28:55.140 --> 3:28:58.180]  You know, listen, I know you're humble. I know you're like me
[3:28:58.980 --> 3:29:00.980]  But I really want you to sit back and
[3:29:01.540 --> 3:29:03.540]  cogitate or meditate
[3:29:04.260 --> 3:29:05.700]  on the fact that

[3:29:17.140 --> 3:29:20.500]  It begins to dawn it is more important than ever
[3:29:20.980 --> 3:29:27.140]  That you realize how important you are that you be more active than you've ever been the tip of the spear is banned on billion

[3:30:50.100 --> 3:30:57.740]  I'm sitting here.
[3:30:57.740 --> 3:31:04.780]  It's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news, reporting on the fact
[3:31:04.780 --> 3:31:09.660]  that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and
[3:31:09.660 --> 3:31:15.340]  Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies they did on
[3:31:15.340 --> 3:31:20.580]  children it caused myocarditis that starts swelling and heart attacks. And then I noticed
[3:31:20.580 --> 3:31:24.860]  that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation. It's
[3:31:24.860 --> 3:31:28.860]  not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[3:31:28.860 --> 3:31:34.660]  It's just crazy. And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from
[3:31:34.660 --> 3:31:39.060]  the vaccines. It doesn't hurt anybody. Your conspiracy theorists, if you say it, it's
[3:31:39.060 --> 3:31:43.100]  just crazy. And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these
[3:31:43.100 --> 3:31:47.260]  vaccines are going to cause heart problems. They gave the exact reasons why and now it
[3:31:47.260 --> 3:31:51.980]  happened. That's why info wars is on air because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with
[3:31:51.980 --> 3:31:55.740]  even more of this crap. This is just insane. These people are killers.
[3:31:55.740 --> 3:32:02.940]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[3:32:02.940 --> 3:32:08.820]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides,
[3:32:08.820 --> 3:32:16.220]  horrible crashes and again, so many toxins on all of the new tropic products that we
[3:32:16.220 --> 3:32:23.580]  sell at infowarstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality and they're long lasting
[3:32:23.580 --> 3:32:28.700]  and they help focus your mind. And right now our strongest product, the three new tropics

[3:32:58.980 --> 3:33:09.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:09.980 --> 3:33:30.660]  Let's get to these collars that have been holding really, really patiently and bring
[3:33:30.660 --> 3:33:36.540]  them amazing points. Let's talk to Steve in Utah, then Steve in Nevada. Steve, thank
[3:33:36.540 --> 3:33:41.380]  you so much. You're on the air with Mike Cernovich on a very historic day and we might
[3:33:41.380 --> 3:33:45.820]  be getting call written house on today, Saturday or Sunday. Just leave it at that. His mom
[3:33:45.820 --> 3:33:48.620]  has been on. We've talked to call before. They promised they'd come on if he was found
[3:33:48.620 --> 3:33:52.900]  not guilty, so we think that the type of folks will keep their promise to look for that.
[3:33:52.900 --> 3:33:56.220]  But let's go back to the phone call. Steve in Utah, go ahead.
[3:33:56.220 --> 3:33:57.940]  Hey, how you doing?
[3:33:57.940 --> 3:34:02.220]  Man, I'm glad that he was found not guilty, but like Mike Cernovich said, this should
[3:34:02.220 --> 3:34:03.220]  never have happened.
[3:34:03.220 --> 3:34:10.340]  Yeah, of course. I just want to speak on the fact that we in life, as we go up throughout
[3:34:10.340 --> 3:34:16.020]  the day, we interact with demonic people and we just don't even know it. We don't even
[3:34:16.020 --> 3:34:22.740]  realize that you can't see it until there's some kind of catalyst or activation of the
[3:34:22.740 --> 3:34:33.180]  demonicness of whether it's violent, gaslighting or some other devious act they'll commit
[3:34:33.180 --> 3:34:39.100]  and, you know, we just don't get it. We just, we just, we just don't, we don't even know
[3:34:39.100 --> 3:34:40.100]  it.
[3:34:40.100 --> 3:34:42.580]  Because it'll even hurt them. They'll go out of their way. I had a family member that
[3:34:42.580 --> 3:34:46.180]  I knew forever. I knew had problems and I got them very close to me and then they did
[3:34:46.180 --> 3:34:49.940]  all these horrible things and try to destroy us and they just laughed at me at the end
[3:34:49.940 --> 3:34:53.940]  and said, don't you know I hate you and I hate God. I actually told me that, Mike. Sorry,
[3:34:53.940 --> 3:34:55.940]  go ahead and call her.
[3:34:55.940 --> 3:35:02.300]  What's going to happen is, you know, we don't understand. We don't, you know, we don't have
[3:35:02.300 --> 3:35:06.620]  a grasp of what's really going on, but one day something's going to happen and on the
[3:35:06.620 --> 3:35:11.780]  other hand, we are all going to activate, we are all going to, you know, as a, as, as
[3:35:11.780 --> 3:35:18.500]  in, in concert, you know, everyone that is against this is going to, I think, step forward
[3:35:18.500 --> 3:35:23.260]  and just, you know, like you said, it's going to be a fight between good and evil and good
[3:35:23.260 --> 3:35:28.460]  will prevail and that will be, you know, good prevailing. It will just, it will be like
[3:35:28.460 --> 3:35:32.900]  simultaneously an awakening. I would, you know,
[3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:37.780]  I recently asked Mike this and I'll go back to you, Steve. What their, the system admits
[3:35:37.780 --> 3:35:41.100]  they're scared with their documents. They go, Oh, the awakening. We got to suppress
[3:35:41.100 --> 3:35:45.380]  it. Oh, what are we going to do? Oh, I mean, they, they know something's coming. They fear.
[3:35:45.380 --> 3:35:47.460]  What would you call it?
[3:35:47.460 --> 3:35:51.420]  What would I call that the zeitgeist at the moment would be the final, we're entering
[3:35:51.420 --> 3:35:56.980]  the final stand. The written house barely, that's what you have to look at. Not just
[3:35:56.980 --> 3:36:01.620]  that he won, but he barely won. He only won because a few brave live streamers were there
[3:36:01.620 --> 3:36:04.220]  and they got that footage. Otherwise, it would have been doctored.
[3:36:04.220 --> 3:36:07.580]  Dr. Hernandez. Yeah. Dr. Hernandez. The FBI, they covered
[3:36:07.580 --> 3:36:12.460]  up the video. They had video clearing Kyle written house of all crimes. So we now know
[3:36:12.460 --> 3:36:17.380]  the FBI is spying on everybody, but they're only going to use it to frame people and try
[3:36:17.380 --> 3:36:22.100]  to get innocent people convicted. Think about how you, you're an agency and a group of people
[3:36:22.100 --> 3:36:25.460]  together. Like my crew is great people. If I tried to frame somebody, they all turned
[3:36:25.460 --> 3:36:29.180]  against me. I wouldn't do it. Anyways, imagine a group where you just do this all day long.
[3:36:29.180 --> 3:36:33.260]  Yeah. Where the FBI whistleblower. So I call it the Kyle written house. His persecution
[3:36:33.260 --> 3:36:38.900]  was the, the Alamo, except they didn't kill him, but that's what they wanted. They were
[3:36:38.900 --> 3:36:43.660]  trying to kill him. In a way, it was almost like the last day of the Alamo. So people
[3:36:43.660 --> 3:36:50.180]  have to, who are patriotic, have to feel it gets energized. Also recognizing that they,
[3:36:50.180 --> 3:36:53.140]  what they really tried to do to this kid, they tried to break his immortal soul.
[3:36:53.140 --> 3:36:56.820]  And by the way, they're already on Twitter making fun of him collapsing. Imagine life
[3:36:56.820 --> 3:37:00.580]  in prison. You've already been in jail for six months in the first year and then now
[3:37:00.580 --> 3:37:03.460]  you're not going to be in prison for a life when you're getting death threats all day.
[3:37:03.460 --> 3:37:07.180]  Yeah. I think anybody might collapse. It's good that they're doing that though. That's
[3:37:07.180 --> 3:37:13.620]  what we've been talking about is evil doesn't know when to stop. And it's good that they're
[3:37:13.620 --> 3:37:19.820]  siding with a convicted serial child rapist. It's good that they're mocking child or Kyle
[3:37:19.820 --> 3:37:23.780]  Rittenhouse for showing humanity. We want them to do as Napoleon said, never interrupt
[3:37:23.780 --> 3:37:28.380]  your any moment. They're making a mistake. So what I'm looking at online and what I'm
[3:37:28.380 --> 3:37:33.260]  seeing from the left is beautiful. Give me more. Give me more. Do more. Defend more of
[3:37:33.260 --> 3:37:37.580]  the indefensible. It's hard to believe what's, I mean, they're such villains. Maybe this
[3:37:37.580 --> 3:37:42.420]  is a simulation. These people are ridiculously bad, but they don't have plausible deniability
[3:37:42.420 --> 3:37:47.980]  anymore. We want them to come out. We want moral clarity. My mantra, the way I define
[3:37:47.980 --> 3:37:53.620]  our age is we live in the age of moral clarity. You can no longer say, well, there are some
[3:37:53.620 --> 3:37:57.420]  good apples. The FBI, there's just a few bad apples, but the line agents. Oh, they're
[3:37:57.420 --> 3:38:02.580]  like, Oh, this vaccine, a racist, your immune system makes you get sicker, but you're going
[3:38:02.580 --> 3:38:05.860]  to take more that they admit it and then what you and them try to make you do it. It's total
[3:38:05.860 --> 3:38:11.060]  clarity. You're right. Steve, finish your point. Go ahead.
[3:38:11.060 --> 3:38:18.060]  I just think they're, they're just oblivious to, they just don't have the, how do I explain
[3:38:18.060 --> 3:38:22.340]  it? They don't have the subtleties of just, they don't get it. You know what I mean?
[3:38:22.340 --> 3:38:23.340]  They're in their own world.
[3:38:23.340 --> 3:38:28.860]  They just act on it and, and it doesn't, oh, I don't, I don't know if there's no consequence
[3:38:28.860 --> 3:38:36.980]  or what. It's just, it's just they, they don't, they're oblivious to just how wicked their
[3:38:36.980 --> 3:38:37.980]  actions are.
[3:38:37.980 --> 3:38:39.980]  They're not oblivious. No, they know. No, they don't.
[3:38:39.980 --> 3:38:43.140]  That's what I called Steve. The call is great. And you, you brought up some good conversational
[3:38:43.140 --> 3:38:48.900]  points. We live in the age of moral clarity. There's, they know what they do. It isn't
[3:38:48.900 --> 3:38:52.300]  like when price has been crucified and he said, forgive them, father, for they know
[3:38:52.300 --> 3:38:55.740]  not what they do. They know the end is about it all being clear.
[3:38:55.740 --> 3:38:56.740]  They know what they did.
[3:38:56.740 --> 3:39:00.620]  I told her, the end is about everything becoming clear. So you make the right decision or make
[3:39:00.620 --> 3:39:03.980]  the wrong decision. And on general Flynn last Saturday, did a big powerful interview with
[3:39:03.980 --> 3:39:08.140]  him. I just went live a few days ago and he said, listen, courage is a decision, but
[3:39:08.140 --> 3:39:10.580]  also serving evil is a decision. It's a decision.
[3:39:10.580 --> 3:39:15.340]  Right. So we live in a beautiful time because you are choosing. You can't claim you didn't
[3:39:15.340 --> 3:39:16.340]  know.
[3:39:16.340 --> 3:39:20.140]  Why would you make a decision to be for raping children? I mean, I have no desire to do it
[3:39:20.140 --> 3:39:22.460]  anyways, but like, why would you do that?
[3:39:22.460 --> 3:39:29.100]  That's the problem with moral people is moral people try to use their own morality to filter
[3:39:29.100 --> 3:39:34.300]  through the decision making process of the people. Whereas when you take the real enlightened
[3:39:34.300 --> 3:39:38.380]  pill in the higher consciousness, you realize they do it because they serve evil, but we
[3:39:38.380 --> 3:39:41.860]  can't project our morality onto them or will never understand them.
[3:39:41.860 --> 3:39:46.700]  No, no way to understand them is to say that they live in a different morality. They don't
[3:39:46.700 --> 3:39:51.100]  have morality. This is how they think they're evil.
[3:39:51.100 --> 3:39:52.100]  The end.
[3:39:52.100 --> 3:39:57.140]  Take out the trash. Absolutely. Stephen Nevada, thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[3:39:57.140 --> 3:39:58.780]  How's it going guys?
[3:39:58.780 --> 3:39:59.940]  Good brother. Thanks for holding.
[3:39:59.940 --> 3:40:05.980]  Yeah, Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones on the line at the same time is unbelievable. Anyway,
[3:40:05.980 --> 3:40:11.940]  I'm a long time listener, both of you guys. And you know, I live out here in Nevada, Southern
[3:40:11.940 --> 3:40:17.500]  Nevada, right outside of Las Vegas. Small, I'm a small business owner and a musician.
[3:40:17.500 --> 3:40:24.340]  And I'm really disgusted to see how the country has responded to this pandemic. I'm glad to
[3:40:24.340 --> 3:40:31.180]  see that Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty. But that's just the start of what's coming
[3:40:31.180 --> 3:40:39.540]  with this takedown. And you know, I really, I don't see where the country is fighting
[3:40:39.540 --> 3:40:45.140]  back against this is strong enough. I mean, what's your take on that?
[3:40:45.140 --> 3:40:46.780]  I agree, Mike.
[3:40:46.780 --> 3:40:50.860]  I think more than ever, people are waking up and taking a stand. Look what's happening
[3:40:50.860 --> 3:40:55.260]  with the school board elections. Young Ken is a typical stab. I get it. But under this
[3:40:55.260 --> 3:41:00.100]  level of assault, it should be even more. Well, we have to meet people before it's bigger.
[3:41:00.100 --> 3:41:03.300]  It's kind of got to get better. You have to. You have to. Again, we talked about this
[3:41:03.300 --> 3:41:08.220]  yesterday with the God timeline, the timelines. We're on. We have to look at what happened
[3:41:08.220 --> 3:41:13.420]  and what was good. And what was good is you had brave patriotic Americans doing real journalism
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:17.220]  on the front lines, risking their own lives. You heard an anus could have been killed.
[3:41:17.220 --> 3:41:21.460]  Julio Ross could have been killed in an attempt to suppress that truth. I just say for they
[3:41:21.460 --> 3:41:25.620]  could have been killed. So what I feel like, um, you know, people like this caller, I don't
[3:41:25.620 --> 3:41:30.500]  mean to to indict your character at all. I just say that we need to focus on the people
[3:41:30.500 --> 3:41:33.780]  who are on the front lines. Are we giving them the support that they need? I don't need
[3:41:33.780 --> 3:41:38.460]  the support. I but the people like Elijah Schaefer, who was there, Drew Hernandez, who was there,
[3:41:38.460 --> 3:41:42.780]  Julio Ross was there. There was that other, I forget his name, but he was that white kid
[3:41:42.780 --> 3:41:47.340]  who binger said, well, why did you think it was a riot? And he said, well, by the way,
[3:41:47.340 --> 3:41:50.940]  I know most of those people, they don't make a big deal about it. Behind the scenes, they
[3:41:50.940 --> 3:41:55.180]  get doxxed. People come to their house. They're death threading them all right now, right?
[3:41:55.180 --> 3:41:57.980]  Because they dare to go out and show the truth. Yeah, they showed that's they saved color
[3:41:57.980 --> 3:42:02.220]  written houses life. So what we know, you're right, Drew Hernandez, Drew Hernandez, and
[3:42:02.220 --> 3:42:06.540]  and Elijah Schaefer, the, the, the, the, the, they saved his life. And then that other guy
[3:42:06.540 --> 3:42:12.180]  can't remember. He is really good looking, um, young white guy, right in his mid twenties.
[3:42:12.180 --> 3:42:15.940]  I forget his name, but anyway, the point is, he's got, he's got like a Northern European
[3:42:15.940 --> 3:42:21.980]  name. Very Chad looking. Yeah. That's where we need to focus on, right? Henson. No, they
[3:42:21.980 --> 3:42:26.100]  could find the clip because binger said, well, why did you, he could see, he said, because
[3:42:26.100 --> 3:42:30.940]  I'm about to f and kill you or whatever. Binger was trying to make it look like he was misrepresenting
[3:42:30.940 --> 3:42:35.860]  the video and then he owned binger and it went viral. Oh yeah, I saw that. All right.
[3:42:35.860 --> 3:42:38.540]  Thank you, Steve. All right. We're going to jam in some more calls here on the other side.
[3:42:38.540 --> 3:42:44.220]  But that's where people need to focus on is too much of this, the system, that the system
[3:42:44.220 --> 3:42:50.500]  that who's doing good work and are you amplifying and supporting the people? No, that's really
[3:42:50.500 --> 3:42:55.020]  it. We should support the tip of the spear. We'll be right back.

[3:44:11.940 --> 3:44:12.940]  William?
[3:44:12.940 --> 3:44:16.380]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Can I plug, uh, I was real quick.
[3:44:16.380 --> 3:44:23.380]  Hey, I'm in my sixties and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them into
[3:44:23.380 --> 3:44:27.340]  the ground and you wanted to why and I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let
[3:44:27.340 --> 3:44:32.620]  me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do. I take that B12 and I
[3:44:32.620 --> 3:44:38.620]  am electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department
[3:44:38.620 --> 3:44:44.180]  and my friends will attest to the fact that yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know,
[3:44:44.180 --> 3:44:57.340]  75 and 70. I mean, I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[3:44:57.340 --> 3:45:03.620]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy

[3:46:58.900 --> 3:47:14.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You know, Mike Cernovich doesn't want this story
[3:47:14.820 --> 3:47:19.260]  told on air, but I'm just going to violate his confidence and do it. Alex Jones show
[3:47:19.260 --> 3:47:22.980]  here, final segment war remote short about to take place. I'm going to be on the show.
[3:47:22.980 --> 3:47:26.980]  Mike's probably going to be on a bunch of others, three to six p.m. central. But I said,
[3:47:26.980 --> 3:47:30.860]  hey, let me fly you out here. Let me pay for your hotel. Let me go down. Really needed.
[3:47:30.860 --> 3:47:33.940]  Maybe give me a check if you want. And I go, just give that check to the written house
[3:47:33.940 --> 3:47:36.700]  defense fund because you know they're going to sue him. You know, they're going to try
[3:47:36.700 --> 3:47:41.300]  to have just department and dining. But I think Biden coming out and trying to back off
[3:47:41.300 --> 3:47:47.100]  kind of signifies they know this is a losing battle. They're in Mike. Yeah, I'm, I didn't
[3:47:47.100 --> 3:47:51.460]  want, I don't want your money. I don't want anybody's money. I don't, I want people who
[3:47:51.460 --> 3:47:57.460]  are really because I'm not at the tip of the spear anymore. I'm, I had to withdraw a little
[3:47:57.460 --> 3:48:01.500]  bit retreat just like many people do. And that's something you haven't done yet. And
[3:48:01.500 --> 3:48:06.060]  I think that you need to do anyway. You read these great books about spiritual works by
[3:48:06.060 --> 3:48:11.980]  the great samurai warrior, Masashi, for example, he became so good at what he did that he could
[3:48:11.980 --> 3:48:15.180]  defeat everybody. So then he used a wooden sorter and could defeat everybody with his
[3:48:15.180 --> 3:48:19.140]  wooden sword. And then he went to his cave and wrote his great book. So I had to go
[3:48:19.140 --> 3:48:24.380]  to a cave of spirituality and meditation, literally, I mean, literally I've been in
[3:48:24.380 --> 3:48:31.700]  caves doing spiritual work and spiritual journeys. So for me, I just want people who are on the
[3:48:31.700 --> 3:48:36.300]  front lines to be supported by people. I don't want anything from anybody. You know, I crowd
[3:48:36.300 --> 3:48:41.940]  fun and hoax and I was grateful for the support I had. I did hoax, but I want people supporting
[3:48:41.940 --> 3:48:47.180]  you. I want people supporting all of the independent streamers who saved Carl Rittenhouse's life
[3:48:47.180 --> 3:48:52.500]  from the Lynch mob. Oh, the power of independent streamers is so important. We have to talk
[3:48:52.500 --> 3:48:56.220]  about them more because when people, when people call in, I feel like shaking them by
[3:48:56.220 --> 3:49:00.060]  the collar and saying, you need to become an independent streamer because you're, you
[3:49:00.060 --> 3:49:04.500]  haven't been banned yet. So maybe you go with six months a year, five years, go to events,
[3:49:04.500 --> 3:49:08.180]  stream them, don't even say who you are politically, just having a real record of what's there
[3:49:08.180 --> 3:49:09.180]  defeats the enemy.
[3:49:09.180 --> 3:49:14.020]  Yeah, I want you all with body cams. Every time there's an event, body cam footage, hidden
[3:49:14.020 --> 3:49:19.580]  camera footage, every school board meeting, I want you to save a life. The way you save
[3:49:19.580 --> 3:49:24.020]  a life is with this. This is the way this is Carl Rittenhouse's life was saved with
[3:49:24.020 --> 3:49:26.900]  this. This is what I want people doing. I don't want them.
[3:49:26.900 --> 3:49:31.140]  The cell phone camera is mightier than the sword. Oh, the system is, we know the system
[3:49:31.140 --> 3:49:35.380]  is corrupt, right? You're not doing it. So not having a court transcript, they can lie
[3:49:35.380 --> 3:49:40.340]  about you. The key here is having video of everything. We're not big brother to real
[3:49:40.340 --> 3:49:43.900]  people, their houses, but in public events, we need to document their crimes because the
[3:49:43.900 --> 3:49:48.780]  left is misbehaving. We need to expose it. I agree. The number one thing is more independent
[3:49:48.780 --> 3:49:54.100]  streamers out there would drew Hernandez and what Elijah Schaefer, but all these people
[3:49:54.100 --> 3:49:57.140]  are doing that is key. Yeah, they're there on the front lines. They're
[3:49:57.140 --> 3:50:01.580]  the ones embedded. They Amber Atlee, she was threatened with death. They threatened to kill
[3:50:01.580 --> 3:50:05.100]  women. Julio Ross has been threatened with death. He was a Marine, I believe they tried
[3:50:05.100 --> 3:50:07.540]  to go. Yeah, and you know, they try to kill all these
[3:50:07.540 --> 3:50:14.060]  guys. And I just I want to hear I just I want our people. If I had a magic wand and I could
[3:50:14.060 --> 3:50:18.700]  just wave the wand, I want a lot of people to just knock off the crap about the system.
[3:50:18.700 --> 3:50:24.380]  Because, okay, are you wearing a camera to school board meetings? If you see are you
[3:50:24.380 --> 3:50:28.700]  posting it? Yeah, because it's all an info war because they can they can suppress you
[3:50:28.700 --> 3:50:31.860]  suppressed me all day long. But it's you, the average people that are everything. That's
[3:50:31.860 --> 3:50:36.020]  what we say. You're the info war. You're the victory. You're the answer. You're the resistance.
[3:50:36.020 --> 3:50:40.220]  Yeah, get your footage. The footage can get to the right people. It can get out where
[3:50:40.220 --> 3:50:45.100]  it needs to get video is how you save lives at this point in your life. The camera, the
[3:50:45.100 --> 3:50:49.180]  iPhone cameras might even the sword especially this point, that's what saved his life. That's
[3:50:49.180 --> 3:50:55.420]  where I just want people to get out of this garbage mindset of, well, I try to convince
[3:50:55.420 --> 3:51:00.020]  my brother about the new world. Who cares? Are you taking your camera out there and just
[3:51:00.020 --> 3:51:04.180]  recording and by the way, don't say anything. Don't say anything. That's even more powerful.
[3:51:04.180 --> 3:51:05.980]  Right. Because there's such a liar as you'll catch
[3:51:05.980 --> 3:51:10.580]  him every time. Brad in Pennsylvania. Welcome. Go ahead.
[3:51:10.580 --> 3:51:15.380]  Thanks, Alex and Mike. Appreciate it. And great discussion. I'm just like you, Alex.
[3:51:15.380 --> 3:51:19.060]  I was so pumped to hear him here. Kyle will come back to you.
[3:51:19.060 --> 3:51:24.660]  What is happening? It's quiet. I think you're, I think your headsets breaking up. Brad, keep
[3:51:24.660 --> 3:51:27.860]  going. All right. I just want to say I was so glad
[3:51:27.860 --> 3:51:32.500]  Kyle was acquitted when he was on the witness stand. That was powerful testimony that he
[3:51:32.500 --> 3:51:36.100]  got up there and had the courage to even though he broke down and cried.
[3:51:36.100 --> 3:51:41.700]  Sorry, Mike's, Mike's cord came out. I apologize, brother. He's getting in. Keep making your
[3:51:41.700 --> 3:51:50.020]  point, Brad. Come help him plug his cord in. So the fact that he was acquitted was awesome.
[3:51:50.020 --> 3:51:55.620]  He deserved to be acquitted. The footage, you're right, Mike, the, the, the video footage
[3:51:55.620 --> 3:52:01.140]  was key because even the layman, the people that weren't there didn't know what happened
[3:52:01.140 --> 3:52:07.780]  when we could see that he was defending himself and he was being chased down. There's no question.
[3:52:07.780 --> 3:52:11.420]  He, whether he was, should have been there or not is not even a concern to me because
[3:52:11.420 --> 3:52:15.940]  he was protecting, like you said, Alex, he was there because his dad lived nearby and
[3:52:15.940 --> 3:52:21.460]  he was just doing what he thought was right. He was put, he was put in a situation that
[3:52:21.460 --> 3:52:24.700]  he couldn't even control after he got there. Exactly. Why are we supposed to roll over
[3:52:24.700 --> 3:52:27.860]  to a giant, a horrid of child molesters running around burning stuff?
[3:52:27.860 --> 3:52:31.820]  What were they there? Yeah. BG on the scene. I mean, this is, this really, these are the
[3:52:31.820 --> 3:52:37.100]  heroes of the day is the lawyers who have the courage to defend these people because
[3:52:37.100 --> 3:52:41.340]  a lot of the January 6th defendants couldn't get competent lawyers because you know that
[3:52:41.340 --> 3:52:43.700]  if they're a lawyer defending somebody who's,
[3:52:43.700 --> 3:52:47.980]  Oh no, no, no, no, no. In my cases, they've run off and won't let lawyers out. One on
[3:52:47.980 --> 3:52:52.860]  the case. Yeah. Or they'll try to find conflicts and they'll say, there's a conflict to interest
[3:52:52.860 --> 3:52:56.780]  here. They'll find some procedural way to keep your lawyers out. The written house
[3:52:56.780 --> 3:53:01.100]  fortunately was able to get lawyers. Those lawyers deserve credit because that's a lot.
[3:53:01.100 --> 3:53:04.140]  They're getting death threats. You think Kyle Rittenhouse's lawyers aren't getting death
[3:53:04.140 --> 3:53:07.860]  threats. You think they don't have to go with armed security now because the left, here's
[3:53:07.860 --> 3:53:13.980]  what I noticed post 9 11 Eric Holder, all these left wing lawyers would represent terrorists.
[3:53:13.980 --> 3:53:17.980]  And you know what I thought at the time? Cause I was naive. I said, you know what? They just
[3:53:17.980 --> 3:53:22.420]  believe in the constitution and they believe that I believe this. They believe terrorists
[3:53:22.420 --> 3:53:27.620]  have a right to a trial. But then January 6th happens. Rittenhouse happens. Your stuff
[3:53:27.620 --> 3:53:31.740]  happens. They're nowhere to be found. So we now know that the left, the only reason they
[3:53:31.740 --> 3:53:36.460]  defended terrorists isn't because they believed in due process of law is because they wanted
[3:53:36.460 --> 3:53:39.940]  to free terrorists so that they could get more terrorists. I agree. Great point, Brad.
[3:53:39.940 --> 3:53:44.140]  Anything else? Yeah, I just want to say, Alex, you deserve all the defense you can get to.
[3:53:44.140 --> 3:53:49.780]  So saveinfoors.com for you for because you're what you do is purport honest news. I don't
[3:53:49.780 --> 3:53:55.500]  care what anyone says. That's I've been listening to you for like 15 years now, daily. And it's
[3:53:55.500 --> 3:54:01.140]  just real news, factual news. You're just a strong patriot. You're brave. Your courage
[3:54:01.140 --> 3:54:05.780]  is spreading like wildfire. So keep it up, man. Well, courage is contagious. Thank you,
[3:54:05.780 --> 3:54:09.100]  Brad. But I have to have a lot of courage to fight this evil and take over. But no, I
[3:54:09.100 --> 3:54:15.700]  sold my house. I'm liquidating everything I've got to fund the info war. And I'm not even
[3:54:15.700 --> 3:54:18.660]  worried about these fake lawsuits and all this crap. I didn't see money to keep battling
[3:54:18.660 --> 3:54:24.180]  those out while I run my operation and just move forward. That's a distraction. And and
[3:54:24.180 --> 3:54:30.180]  money is an easy thing for folks to give it. Saveinfoors.com so we can focus on the mission
[3:54:30.180 --> 3:54:35.860]  of taking on the new world order. Let's take another call here. Let's talk to Spencer in
[3:54:35.860 --> 3:54:40.980]  Virginia Spencer here with Mike Cernovich. Go ahead. Hey, Alex and Mike, I just had a
[3:54:40.980 --> 3:54:46.180]  question about the timing of the whole written house trial. I thought it was interesting that
[3:54:46.180 --> 3:54:51.140]  the verdict just came out and nobody's really talking about just laying. And that trial started
[3:54:51.140 --> 3:54:54.980]  about three days ago, I believe. So I was just wondering if you thought either of you
[3:54:54.980 --> 3:54:58.980]  thought that there was some sort of connection between the two or if it's just like merely
[3:54:58.980 --> 3:55:05.140]  a coincidence. The feds definitely timed the glane Maxwell trial with the written house
[3:55:05.140 --> 3:55:08.900]  trial, because that's not getting any coverage at all. It's completely flowing under the
[3:55:08.900 --> 3:55:13.460]  radar they have. They realize that this was our time. So they were going to either have
[3:55:13.460 --> 3:55:17.460]  her commit suicide as Jeffrey Epstein did, obviously. A little too obvious. Yeah, a little
[3:55:17.460 --> 3:55:21.620]  too obvious. Or they could say, well, we'll get her. We'll try her under the radar when
[3:55:21.620 --> 3:55:25.620]  everybody's focused on written house. So that's a good point. And it's a I don't want to say
[3:55:25.620 --> 3:55:30.180]  it's a failure of me or Alex or any of us because the written house case was obviously something
[3:55:30.820 --> 3:55:34.740]  of fun. No, you're right. They scale it at the same time as a diversion. Yeah, but we definitely
[3:55:34.740 --> 3:55:38.580]  need to turn our focus. We should all get on that. I'm glad Spencer. Thank you, Spencer.
[3:55:38.580 --> 3:55:41.940]  Spencer, that's why we take calls. You guys always take us some other directions. Anything
[3:55:41.940 --> 3:55:47.940]  else, Spencer? Yeah, I'm up. All right, here's what's going to happen. Helen, Tony, Thomas,
[3:55:47.940 --> 3:55:52.580]  we're going to transfer your calls to the other studio that's literally just 60, 70 feet away.
[3:55:53.860 --> 3:55:58.100]  And we're going to go to your calls within the first 10 minutes of the war with Owen
[3:55:58.100 --> 3:56:01.460]  Schreuer. I'm going to be co-hosting with Owen. I'm going to go in there right now with him.
[3:56:02.180 --> 3:56:06.260]  Max Hermes and his crew has got a deserved lunch, a late lunch. They're going to get some
[3:56:06.260 --> 3:56:11.460]  lunch. We'll see what happens with them. I want to say, great job, the crew. Great job to everybody.
[3:56:11.460 --> 3:56:15.700]  This has been another amazing transmission. And all that you spread in the word and reaching
[3:56:15.700 --> 3:56:20.820]  new people is amazing. But like Mike said, actually you getting out there, being citizen
[3:56:20.820 --> 3:56:25.300]  journalist. I know you're very humble people, but think of that office you're in. It's very easy to
[3:56:25.300 --> 3:56:29.060]  do. You've got to be the resistance. You've got to be the leadership. Max Hermes, closing comments.
[3:56:29.060 --> 3:56:32.180]  Don't let them bait you. When you go out and do this, they're going to try to bait you. Who are
[3:56:32.180 --> 3:56:36.980]  you with? What are you doing? Why are you here? They might even shove you a little bit. Remember,
[3:56:36.980 --> 3:56:42.420]  you have to be wise as a serpent, gentle as a dove. But wise, they're going to try to bait you.
[3:56:42.420 --> 3:56:46.340]  Well, tell them, tell them I'm a local stringer because they trust the mainstream media. You're
[3:56:46.340 --> 3:56:49.940]  not lying. You're a stringer for God. You're a stringer for the internet. But just say, a stringer
[3:56:49.940 --> 3:56:54.500]  just people that shoots video and people buy it. Say, I'm a stringer. Yep. That's a great point.
[3:56:54.500 --> 3:57:00.100]  I'm a stringer. I'm doing freelance work. I sell my footage to media outlets because if you're
[3:57:00.100 --> 3:57:03.620]  trying, it's not a lie. If you're trying to sell your footage, they just say, oh yeah, I get footage.
[3:57:03.620 --> 3:57:07.140]  And then I get it on the news and the media and everything like that. And then they'll think you're
[3:57:07.140 --> 3:57:11.940]  part of the establishment. Stringers will save the world because it's an info war and they want
[3:57:11.940 --> 3:57:15.700]  to intimidate everybody. And maybe you do it for six months, they ban your accounts. Somebody else
[3:57:15.700 --> 3:57:21.300]  steps up. Just everybody do your part. The Hydra, but the good Hydra. They cut your head off, but
[3:57:21.300 --> 3:57:25.460]  a hundred more heads appear. That's exactly what happens like Starfish. All right, best website

[3:58:53.460 --> 3:58:59.060]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[3:58:59.060 --> 3:59:04.020]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[3:59:04.020 --> 3:59:09.940]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[3:59:09.940 --> 3:59:17.540]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old. And I was already
[3:59:17.540 --> 3:59:21.860]  taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[3:59:21.860 --> 3:59:26.340]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't
[3:59:26.340 --> 3:59:32.020]  happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know,
[3:59:32.020 --> 3:59:36.980]  this is the ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to
[3:59:36.980 --> 3:59:43.140]  put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[3:59:43.140 --> 3:59:44.020]  cleared up my skin.
[3:59:44.020 --> 3:59:52.980]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
